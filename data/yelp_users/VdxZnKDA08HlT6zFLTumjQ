I decided to support a local business rather than order my silver supplies online. I went in excited to get supplies and learn a new craft - but wow - the staff is so rude and condescending. The clerk literally turned her head and laughed when I asked a question about polishing silver. I quickly paid and left. I won't return. So sad that a local business can't treat their customers with respect, much less show appreciation for their business.

I've been eating there for years, it is classic Phoenix! The sandwiches are artfully made to your exact specifications and I love how you can taste every ingredient in every bite. That is their standard of tasty quality! My fave is Where's the Beef with a portion of turkey, ask for shredded cheese! I also like the pastrami on dark rye with avocado, shredded cheese and coleslaw! My favorite place to sit is in the wine room unless the weather is nice, then outside is the place to be!

I love the food, the setting, all of it! Sometimes the staff is a little too lax, but for the most part, it's a great, yummy place to enjoy, have a meeting, or just chill.

When you are visiting IKEA in Tempe and are not in the mood for meatballs, check out Forefathers! It's yummy, quick and affordable, nice staff too. Don't forget to try the sauces!

Slick and stylish, yet still comfy, Maizie's is a great spot to catch up with an old friend or meet a new one. The food is hearty, my fave are the inside out burgers! Try the crazy apple dessert, so tasty! Friendly service too!

So delicious, total nana home style cooking! Chorizo breakfast super flavorful, cheery service. Setting is not at all fancy, very low-key, but comfy and casual. Strong Chicano vibe, feel-good kind of place. Next best thing to Nana's house!

After you finish a tasty meal at Windsor, you absolutely have to treat yourself to some ice cream at Churn. My fave is chocolate fudge with pecans and caramel! Score!

We found a little slice of the islands right in our very own hood: Esther's Jamaican Food. Located in the middle of a vacant strip mall on Olive Avenue, we always thought we missed the chance to visit because there is a huge FOR LEASE sign on the window. One day, I pulled over to see if the sign was for Esther's place or for the spot next door. Much to my pleasant surprise, it was the latter! Patrick and I stopped in for lunch and all I can say - life changing. A long time ago, I worked at two different Caribbean restaurants run by Jamaican and Trinidad chefs and I've never been able to find that style of cooking. And I've tried a lot. I'm happy to report that Esther's hit it. It's small, not fancy, but has a lot of spirit. And you know it's authentic island food when island peeps come in and order. We waited about 15-minutes, and our dishes arrived hot and fresh in take-out containers. Everything is served to go, but they have a few tables set up if you want to stay and eat and watch a little of TV that hangs from the ceiling.  I loved the wall of Jamaican groceries, and also the drink fridge that was filled with a variety of Caribbean sodas.  I didn't even really notice the ice cream bars until later, I'll tell you why in a bit. My my Jerk Chicken plate came with friend plantains, rice and beans and potato salad. The rice was spicy, but not enough to make you stop eating. I nibbled on the potato salad to cool down my tongue every few bites. My chicken was so moist, it fell off the bone. It's sweet, a tad tangy with a slow, island burn. By the end of my second piece, I reached in the ice cream display and ripped open a butter pecan bar and started licking. Esther winked at me from the cash register, folded her arms, and chuckled. A look that showed I was not the first to do this. Patrick got curried goat with cabbage, rice and beans, and gobbled it down.If you're to into soda and want something more exciting than water, Esther's offers sorrel and ginger drinks as well.

Two out of three times I had a weird experience here. First time was awesome, the second time they made my brows wayyyy too thin. This last time, my brows were perfect BUT the lady did it too tight/hard and left open sores on my skin. She literally snapped out chunks of skin in the process of threading. Not only was it painful then, but now as well. I have a big event to attend later this week and now I have these small scabs around my brows on both sides. Owww! Never going here again!

When it's 110 degrees in Phoenix, Twirl is one of my favorite places to take shelter. Yummy treats, nice staff, cool setting! Definitely a must-visit place!

My new favorite coffee place! The drinks are all themed around Mecican culture and are a delight to drink! So creative! Lots of room to work on your laptop and there is a sandwich shop next door for food! Gotta check out Tres Leches!
