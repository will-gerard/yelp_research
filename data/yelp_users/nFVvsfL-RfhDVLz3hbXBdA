BY FAR WORST EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD. Only gave one star because 0 wasn't an option.   I was in a car accident on February 12th. I immediately called Allstate and my agent recommended taking my car to Caliber Collision. He said that sales reps come into his office and mention that they will cover a rental car for the duration of the fix. Later, Caliber called me saying they would only cover 3 days of rental (a whooping $75). In a bind, I agreed and was quoted 3 weeks for my car to be fixed. At 3 weeks Bernie called me and pushed it to 4. Then another call pushing it to 4.5 weeks. At this point I'm getting excuse after excuse as to why my car is not done yet and a long list of work to be done. I then involve my insurance as they are equally unsatisfied with the time. Flash-forward and it is now taking 6 weeks to finish my car (March 25th) and guess what? It's STILL NOT DONE. Here we are into 7 weeks. I was quoted Wednesday. On Wednesday they call and say Thursday. On Thursday they call and say Friday. On Friday they call and say 5pm Friday (note: the close of business is 530pm). Finally Gill calls and says he got approval for a few extra days of rental car coverage. 10 days. A total of $250 off. WOW.   The worst part of this entire situation was the very obvious lack of customer care or concern. Besides for an early-on phone call Bernie the only time I ever talked to Caliber is when I called Allstate and they called the shop insisting they give me an update. I did not receive regular updates, I was not told of the delays in a timely matter. In fact, I even returned my rental car TWICE as the shop told me they would have my car done on a certain day. The third time I decided to keep it, and that was a good move on my part because they pushed the date back AGAIN.   To recap: - I was quoted 3 weeks to have to have the car fixed and ultimately it took 7 weeks. Over TWICE the TIME quoted.  - My only compensation for the extra rental car expense I've had is $250 of a $1,225 bill.  - Here we are 7 weeks done and I have yet to receive an apology from anyone.  Here's the thing: I can understand a delay in a car getting fixed. Parts require shipping and sometimes and things need to be replaced in order. If the shop would have been up front with the delays, called me with updates, and worked with me to get things done quickly maybe I wouldn't be so furious. A little customer service goes along way. And let me tell you: Calber Collision knows NOTHING about customer service, and nothing about a timely repair.   I WILL NEVER USE OR RECOMMEND THIS SHOP AGAIN, and you shouldn't either.

Welp... here I am sitting at Sip Coffee and Beer House, mid-day, soaking up the free Wi-Fi and trying to change my life. I immediately ordered a Cartel Coffee cold brew. If you're ordering for the first time, get a large, you'll thank me later.   *Orders another coffee*  Scrolling through LinkedIn jobs I've recently decided I want a new job that I can enjoy. For all you job searchers out there I'm sure you understand that this is easier said than done. Why can't job postings just be real? Inside Sales Rep? I think what you really mean is sitting on the phone making 100 cold-calls a day. Pass.   *Orders another coffee*  OH! OH! Community Managers at Yelp? I love Phoenix! I'm a social connector! I have a fire in my belly! Wait, what? Forget that part... Pick me! Pick me!   ^ That was my exact reaction... until I scrolled to the bottom of the page, read a blog, and stalked Hilary H. for over an hour. I've now decided two things: 1. I will never be able to write 1000 reviews over night and 2. 2,448 friends? Is she for real? I think I have 19.   *Switches from coffee to beer*  *Calls mom to cry*  *Calls best friend to cry more*  After my emotional roller coaster ended, I put on some gangster rap. I prefer "I'mma Shine" by Youngbloodz, because if it's good enough to motivate Channing Tatum in Step Up, it's good enough for me.   I also ordered a breakfast sandwich. It comes on an everything-bagel, huge bonus, and of course I added bacon. I actually ordered it without any roasted tomato vinaigrette because that flavor combo seemed pretty intimidating to me. Lo and behold, the Sip kitchen knows me better than I know myself and added it anyways. Boy, am I glad they did.   On a real note: this place is great! If you're looking for some free Wi-Fi, a beer to cry over, or a carb-o-load to start your day you'll feel right at home here.

Got a $18 wash and the car looked horrible. Cup holders were not vacuumed. Interior dash was not whipped down. Side mirrors were left with water marks.   After leaving I turned around and asked them to do the car again pointing out everything they had missed. A guy helped me but used a single wet rag and did a quick once over. Car still not clean.   Would not recommend this place and would not come back again.
