Good and honest. Kevin works fast and is able to diagnose the problem right away. Very honest with everything without trying to persuade me to get new tires. Great service.

Horrible customer service! My friend and I were there not too long ago to grab a few things. Looking for a fuse we ran into an employee asking if they had one laying around he replied "no, we don't carry that" (rude tone). I was also curious about another product but he straight up walked off. Customer service is TERRIBLE. Definitely need better employees or atleast teach em to talk to people.

Frys do have a wide variety of selections and I prefer frys over best buy any day. Only thing I wasn't very fond of is the customer service. I walked in and asked a question about rca cables, converts, and such for my car. Im not sure if the guy even knew what he was talking about. I was surprised of how little he knew about his section. Only employee that has beard. His customer service is poor and he isn't very knowledgeable about car audio. If you're looking for car audio accessories you're better off going elsewhere. They know very little about their products. Unless you know exactly what you're looking for, I wouldn't recommend asking them.

I came in early in the morning letting the tech know that I needed an alignment. My car pulls to the right and I needed that fixed asap. After the service was finished he told me my front left tire goes to the left and they fixed that and aligned everything. He claims everything is good. Soooooo then if they fixed it why is my car pulling even harder to the right and my steering wheel is off point. 2 stars is cuz of them being so polite. The way the techs talks sounds like they dont know what they're talking about.
