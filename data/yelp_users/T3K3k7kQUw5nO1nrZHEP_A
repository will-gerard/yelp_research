We love Nick's!! We are huge fans of Italian food so when we moved into the area we decided to try out Nick's. The food is amazing! Every pasta is hand made and the sauces are delicious! We also love the atmosphere. Not a large place and can get a little busy on the weekends.

We went for the first time today and we were thoroughly impressed! It was a late Tuesday morning so there were only a few other customers present. The staff was very friendly and the decor creates a great atmosphere. Great food selection to choose from for breakfast. I had the caramel banana pancakes in multigrain and they were the best pancakes I've ever had!!! My mom got the veggie scramble with potats and really like it. My husband loved the french toast and thought the cinnamon roll was pretty good.  We are so glad we found this breakfast spot and will definitely be going back!

After trying the chain pets stores and a local groomer to get my chiuaua's nails clipped, I decided to try out Shampooch and Kitty Too. I called ahead of time to ensure availability and they said to come right in. There were four employees working with two other dogs there. Everyone was very friendly and they clipped his nails super quick. With other places I've been I get scared when they clip his dew-claw since in curls inward but here they were so professional and had no difficulty. I'm so excited to have found this place and will definitely be going back. Btw, the charge for the nail clip was $10.
