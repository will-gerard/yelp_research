This place NEVER fails me! Always delicious, piping hot, fresh, yummy Mexican food and lots of chips and salsa!! I ordered the chile verde con papas and it was amazing!! I love when the server brings your food out and they say, "be careful, hot plate". Seriously the best because you know your food is going to be hot! Most sit-down Mexican food places in the Valley are mediocre at best...not Comedor Guadalajara!!

Don't miss out on this hidden gem! We found this place via Groupon. I started with the November Rain cocktail which was strong in a good way and very tasty (well strong for me, maybe I am a lightweight). For dinner I had the Pork Medallions with green chili cornbread and tortilla soup as my two side dishes. While the pork was delish, I felt the chorizo was a bit understated. The flavor of the soup was divine and the cornbread was a fun compliment to the meal. Oh and hooray for local music!!  The meal was excellent and the Groupon made it that much better, without it I think the food is a tad overpriced.

Longtime user, first time reviewer! Please don't judge! After our dinner at The Greeks Grill I decided it was time to pay back the community that helped me through so many food dilemmas. Hubby wanted pizza for our Friday night dinner, I wanted Greek...boom...I won!!! After looking through our many Greek food options we decided to go with this little gem. When we pulled up there were not many people which made me a little leery, but not enough to scare me away. I had the Gyro combo w/salad & my other family members had Gyro combos w/fries. The pita was soft & yummy, the meat was flavorful & delicious, the salad had the tangy Greek dressing that I love & the fries were crispy on the outside & soft on the inside. Everything was great (not the best in the entire world, but really, really good!)!! The best part was the owner! He was so sweet! He showered our big group with hummus & pita on the house & topped us off w/baklava. Seriously the best customer service & he was just so cute! In my book that deserves 5 stars because service is part of the experience for me. Please give them a try!!

This is a cute little spot! I love the hip decor. We even got to enjoy the sweet little patio out back on a cool night. We went as a family for our Friday night dinner...well it was actually our Friday night snack. :) We ordered some fries off of the appetizer menu...they were good. We also each ordered our own empanada. Everyone got something different and loved them so much that nobody wanted to give up a bite. I ordered the jalape√±o popper with the salted ham. Oh my....little popper heaven...hubby wanted a bite...that wasn't happening!!! Next time we need to go back for more than just a snack. If you are looking to try something out of the ordinary check this place out...you'll be glad you did! P.S. The little sauce they give you when you sit down is out of this world!!

NO! Just NO!! 4 stars??? Really?!?! I went here with my family based on Yelp reviews. We were excited for the possibility of having a good Mexican food spot fairly close to home. We were extremely disappointed. We were given a small serving of chips and salsa for a family of five, had to ask for a refill, food took forever to be served once ordered (the restaurant was empty), food was barely warm, flavor was bland, the picture in the menu showed that my dish came with sour cream...it didn't and then was told that I would have to pay extra if I wanted it, soda was served in a small glass and kept having to flag the waitress down to ask for refills instead of being checked on and offered a refill. The decor was colorful and fun, but the food and service were blah at best!

I want Rainbow Donuts to be on every corner! Okay, that may be overkill, but the little heavenly pillows, that are also know as glazed donuts stuffed with whipped cream, are glorious!!! Slightly crispy on the outside, fluffy and fresh on the inside...sliced open and slathered with whipped cream. Seriously, a little piece of heaven delivered to earth in the form of a donut!

I had mixed feelings about dining here. A friend of ours chose this place for her birthday celebration and she raved about it, but the 3 1/2 stars had me a bit worried. I am a 4 star or higher kind of girl...life is too short to waste it on mediocre food. I started with the Queen's Cooler which was tasty, but for $9 I felt it could have been a tad stronger. We ordered the Barrio Guacamole...yummy, but just like Barrio Cafe! I was hoping they would be a little unique in this department. Chile Verde was my dinner choice and the word that comes to mind is meh!! First of all they served it on a skillet so I expected it to be hot...it wasn't. The server even said be careful the skillet is hot. Slightly warm? Maybe. But definitely not hot. I hate eating barely warm food! The flavor? Just okay. Desert was their only saving grace. Mexican Bread Pudding...that I would go back for! Overall experience? Not impressed!! insert sad face here

Last minute decision to get my son's haircut on a Monday night. Found this place on Yelp so I thought we would check it out. We arrived at 6:30ish and Pete the barber was with another customer. I asked if he would have time considering it was almost closing time...he said sure...super!! Let me just say he did an amazing job on my sons hair...he took the time to make sure it was perfect. Nice guy, great attention to detail, awesome customer service!!! I think we found our new barbershop!!! Yippee!!! (Is that appropriate to say on a barbershop review?!?!)
