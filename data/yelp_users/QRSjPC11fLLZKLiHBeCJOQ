I DO NOT like Sushi so I cannot give an honest, accurate review of Temari's Sushi,  however my hubby adores the stuff so we go to Temari's often!   What I would like to tell you about is some of the items off the regular menu...    The Teriyaki Beef Rocks  The Karaage Chicken Rocks The Chicken Katsu Rocks The Salad Dressing is the best in town!!!    So there you have it if you are a NON Sushi eater & want to go to dinner with a Sushi Lover... Go Here.   Side note My hubby always orders the same 3 things:  Tuna Poke  ( #8 Heat Factor) Primo Roll  and the Val Vista Roll He also loves the Fish over Rice Sampler Platter  (Nigiri?)  The Staff here is Great  Go during the week  Sit at the Sushi Bar

We are Extremely pleased with our carpet purchase. The carpet is beautiful & really high quality.   We bought over 3000 sq ft of carpet, Mesa Sales gave us a very competitive price & were super flexible working with our schedules.   The installers were professional and did a fantastic job.   We are so happy with Mesa Sales that we are planning on using them to tile the rest of our house and we will continue to recommend them to our family & friends.

Yummy!!! I love Georges, the best gyros in town, get fries or salad you can't go wrong with either. I can't decide which I like better the chicken pita or the original gyro both are so good guess it depends on your mood.  The lasagne is totally delish too.  My only complaint is the soda & tea tastes off, they definately need to install an RO system.

So being of Hispanic origin & a true AZ Native, I would like to think I am somewhat of an authority on Tamales. Not really, but I know what I like & I have tried them all over town. I do believe that these really are the "Best Ever". I love the old standby pork tamales but I thought I would give the chicken and  the corn tamale a try. They both knocked it out of the park, although the Chicken one was" very" spicy, the blend of green chili, chicken & monterey jack cheese was a beautiful palatable combination. Then to cool things down I feasted on the corn tamale which was savory yet sweet,  I love that they did not sweeten the masa for this delectable treat as I was not looking for a dessert tamale. Kudos to the chef now perhaps they could work on the dining room a little. Never mind... I will probably just get my dozen to go anyways.

I was very pleased with Angel Eye Services.  I was a little skeptical at first because I was told they would be there between 10 and 11 am,  they did not show up till 11:15.  I was also very leery when they first walked in because they looked very young and didn't mention they were from the cleaning service. Tara and Andrew definately made up for it and it turns out they were very professional and were very hard workers .  All along the way asking if I had any special requests or if I wanted them to focus on any particular areas.  I had them do a general cleaning with special attention paid to my ceiling fans and baseboards. I thought it was cool that Andrew asked which scent I preferred him to use when cleaning the floors and happy he accepted my request to use my Pinesol (hubba's favorite scent).   My expectations were exceeded with this first of many cleaning I am certain.

I am so thrilled to be the first to review this restaurant. The Grill on Main is Yumalish!! My friend Stephanie & I went here on our 30 min lunch break. We were surprised to see how cute the restaurant was inside, for being such a small place they sure made the most of the space. We told the waitress right off the bat we were in a hurry and they totally accommodated (Door to Door in 35). We both ordered the daily lunch special which was a grilled pastrami with Swiss cheese & sauerkraut on rye bread. We were able to modify our sandwiches with no fuss. I hate sauerkraut she doesn't enjoy Rye. They have cool soda choices like Hank's orange cream soda, vanilla cream soda, sarsaparilla and black cherry, they also offer both Coke & Pepsi products which I thought was pretty cool considering many people are very particular about their pop. It was nice to see they had fresh squeezed lemonade as well as fresh brewed iced tea on their menu, which is what we opted for. I just love CHOICES!! Shorty after we ordered the waitress brought some homemade potato chips to our table & said the chef had been experimenting, trust me he can experiment with our table any time yum! Then it happened, the waitress brought our food to the table & OMG the food looked delicious, a very large sandwich with a generous helping of french fries. Everything was hot and tasted very fresh I was especially impressed with the Swiss cheese it was sliced thicker than most & had a very swissy taste sooo good also very stringy when you took a bite. I believe it set the sammy over the top! This food was a total delight, a large portion (we could have easily split) and the most amazing part was the bill... $6.40 for each of us WOW!! The sandwich was 5 bucks the tea was a dollar then tax. What a great buy. I can't wait to go back and try more stuff like the Angus burger, Philly cheese steak or the pulled pork sandwich. I should mention this place is kinda hard to find, it sits between Robson & Center street on the north side of Main in Mesa. Their website was a little tricky as well but here's a link http://www.thegrillonmain.net  My hopes is that this place stays in bizness for a long time it has just the right mix of food, service & atmosphere, but I also know "Main Street" will be a true test for them. Good Luck

Can you say "My new favorite place"  Small but trendy, awesome staff but the food.... Ohhh The Food!! I tried this new place out on Tuesday afternoon mainly because they were so nice to bring a tray of sandwiches to my work on Monday afternoon for everyone to try since they are new to the area & wanted to get their name out there... smart idea. Well I was thrilled with the small but well thought out menu. The friendly guy behind the counter suggested the Turkey Breast Sandwich so I complied. It came to me with tons on quality turkey and homemade stuffing on white toast. Like Thanksgiving in April for my palette... Yum! Other sandwiches included BLT, Reuben, Albacore Tuna, Curry Chicken Salad and several "Pressed" sandwiches along with some tasty lookin salads. They bill this place as healthy and organic so that could be considered a plus too. I liked the overall experience and I will definitely be going back... Hey they have Brewed Iced Tea ta boot, so I am all in!   P.S.  I would say ten bucks average for sandwich, side & drink.

What the "F" are you kidding me people??Please do not open a Restaurant/Bar unless you are ready to serve food and beer Pah leeze!! We thought we would try this place for lunch today & met some friends over there. The place was cute inside all fixed up & looked nothing like the previous tenant The Fishin Hole. There was a duo playing up on stage that sounded really good so we were off to a great start... Then it was all down hill from there!!!! We sat at the bar the server was nice enough but difficult to hear (not because of the music), she asked if we wanted a beer we said sure what do u have on tap...." Well we have 8 beers on tap but we are out of 6, we only have 2 dark beer available" I opted for Tea.  Then we ordered our meal. We Thought about getting the Prime Rib that was on special but the server told us it wouldn't be ready till after 3pm OK no biggie, so 3 of us decided to order the Pork Tenderloin Sandwich & 1 ordered the wings.  Server came back about 10 min later and stated they were out of Pork Sandwiches! Whatever... we then ordered burgers instead. My friend said to the server I want mine running on the plate I will stab it if I need to (meaning extra rare). My hubby got his mushroom Swiss burger first.... Really?? Mushroom straight from the jar not even sauteed ewwww!! Well 15 minutes later the rest of the food finally arrived, the pre pressed patties were overcooked and dry and the fries were cold my friend was less then thrilled. I will give props to the wings they were good quality wings done nice and crispy. Sorry people decent wings are not enough to make me return especially when so many other things were off! I wish you all the luck in the world running your new business it looks like a huge investment. Hope you will listen to the reviews as they come in & learn from them!

We are absolutely thrilled with Mesa TV, they have gone above and beyond our expectations. We bought all of the appliances for our new house here. They gave us the lowest price in town (believe me we shopped around) and they were so flexible on installation...I kept having to cancel because of the cabinet situation (don't get me started) three different times they had to remove the items that they'd  already loaded on their truck because the cabinet guys called me at the last second with "issues" The delivery guy Ray was friendly & oh so patient!!! I hope the owner knows what a gem he has in Ray.  Our overall experience was fantastic & I will only shop here in the future
