Been here twice.  Loved it both times!  Actually today, my brother mentioned he has been there for dinner and wants to take us there to try it.  We beat him to this place.  Now, we just need to pick a date for dinner.  I can not wait!!!

We have a group of 6. Everyone got their meals except for me. I wanted to see if the waiter was going back to get my meal, but he never came back. After 5mins, one of my friend had to go to get the waiter. My meal was not put in the system. He never came to apologize. When everyone was more than 1/2 way finished with their meals, out come mine. The Chicken Cordon Blu was good, but the service from the waiter was terrible.

My friend has been talking about this place for years to me.  She found got me to go there with her for lunch.  WOW, I am a fan now!  The food was good, fast, and great prices.  I only had the veggie egg rolls, gyozas, and the white meat chicken terriyaki.  I NEED to go back to try more things....

Grab lunch with M.  Our second time together here, and I have gotten togo before too.  LOVE this little cozy place.  The customer service is wonderful.  I got the terriyaki chicken bowl, gyoza, and an ice green tea.  The owner lady, we call "mama san", always out to greet us and make sure our drinks are topped off before we leave.    I need to come back to try something else beside the terriyaki chicken!

My husband was craving anything besides hospital food, so I told him about one of my favie lunch places. I dropped by after work to get a boat lot of food that he requested. I got so much food, we needed a box to carry all of it to the hospital. And they taped my drinks so they don't spill. It was awesome!!   Gyozas - 2 orders. YUM!   Panko chicken bowl with terriyaki sauce - Awesome and still crispy after arriving to the hospital   Katsu Pork Plate - The pork and salad was soggy due to the time kept in the container and the hot food steamed it. The flavors were good, so we recommended eating this dish at the place.   Chicken Fried Rice - WOW. Good stuff.

I have been here a couple times.  Once for Sunday brunch and then just regular lunch.  Both times we have had good service and good food.  The parking lot is pretty tiny, so you might need to park on the side street.    I really enjoyed the Roast Chicken Sandwich with provolone, applewood bacon, hatch green chiles, chipotle aioli, and served on a toasted focaccia.  HUM!

Never sat on the patio before...  Love that it is November and we can sit outside and enjoy the weather!  The staff is super friendly and always aiming to please.    I ordered the Blanco Flatbread (roasted garlic cream, mozzarella, parmesan-reggiano, and added roasted chicken).  Less the onions for me on this.  It is crispy, light, and delish!  I tried a slice of the Carne Flatbread from Shane's plate.  YUM!!!  The spicy was the right amount.

Went for lunch with a friend. We love the quick, hot, and good lunch. She had the chicken parm, it came with a salad and pasta. She was super happy with the food. I got the white pizza with sausage. It was good, but I was missing the tomato sauce on my pizza, so I guess I am not a white pizza girl. White pizza = cheese and oil olive. I love their classic pizza = cheese and tomato sauce. It was more than enough for lunch. YUM. The server was awesome, love her.

Love this place for a quick lunch.  All I have had is the pizza.  Combo #2:  2 slice of cheese ( you can add meat for extra $) & 24oz drink for around $5 or so.    The pizza is thin, hot, and melty cheese....  YUM!  Not like NY pie, but great for AZ.

I showed up here to meet a couple of coworkers for lunch.  We work in different buildings so we decided to get lunch outside for a Friday treat.  I got there and thought that the only parking they have is the 6 spaces out front.  I learned later you can park all along the side and back of the building.  HA!    We walked in and was quickly greeted and seated.  3 seconds go by and a serve shows up ready to take our drink order.  She came back in like 30 seconds with the drinks.  And asked for our food order.  We were not ready and asked for a few mins.  She looked away from us and walked away.  She did not seem happy we were not ready.  =(  We quickly scanned the lunch menu and made our choices.  She was back in 3 mins. We ordered and she was happily on her way.  =)    I got the house special chicken, I asked for not spicy (SORRY, I am a whimp).  It was tender white meat lightly battered & fried then covered in special garlic sauce and served with a egg roll.  It was a nice garlic sauce (not too garlicy to kill all your coworkers but just a good amount).  The chicken was completed cooked, tender, and juicy.  But before all that we got chicken corn soup, not bad at all.  Food was not too shabby!  Overall it was a quick lunch and taste good.  I am a full and happy camper.  Now back to work!!!

We had a party of 20! We sat outside. Yes, it was HOT and we were sweaty. The server did he best to knowledge and make sure the group of us were taken of us. He did a fantastic job by himself. Waters were already on the table when we got there. He quickly got our drink and appetizer orders and then told us he is going to get our drink and appetizer orders in. He was quick with the drinks.   The food took awhile. I know all 20 of us ordered different items, so the timing of when all the food is ready took awhile longer than usual. But is is serving 20 people all at 1 time. Like usual the food was tasty, good, and consistent. I tried the Zany Ziti with chicken. Yum and TON of food!   Of course we had to order the half and half pzookie!

I love this place. I have been here several times. I find what I need every time. I do not and can NOT bake. But I love to buy plain cakes and make it my own design. They have decorations for every occasion. It is awesome! The staff has always been super friendly to me. LOVE IT!

Love the cakes here!  My husband's favie is the fruit chiffon cake.  It is a tradition, I need to get one for him every year.  The fruits are fresh, the cake is moist, and the frosting is whipped just right.  The cakes are not too sweet.  I also ordered the roll cakes to give out for Christmas gifts ($5 each).  Love the creme and coffee flavored ones.    The cookies and pastries in the self service cases are great too!!!

The appetizers were yummy:  Asian Nachos - LOVED IT!  Gyoza - Good  Wonton Soup - 2 wontons and salty soup base  I did not tried the rolls but the girls ordered a Kalifornia and Tootsie   For my entree, I got the sesame chicken with brown rice. I thought the sesame chicken was going to be salt, but it was the sweet sauce coating the fried chicken pieces. It was ok but a little tad sweeter than I like. Everyone had a fun time. I knocked them down to four stars because the service was terrible. We had to flag or get our waitress every time. She never refilled drinks or come back to check on the table. We had to get her attention and sometimes she is no where to be found.

This Starbucks is a bigger place than the ones I normally go to.  And everyone there has a laptop, ipad, or holding something electronic.  I felt the need to take out my cell phone and hold it.  he he he...  Everyone (customers and employees) are friendly.  They got the order spot on.    When we were leaving there was a GOOD dog sitting by the door with his leash not tied to anything just waiting for his owner.  Awwwwww....

Our team from work came here for lunch.  It is my first time!  After all these years, I finally made it inside for some food.  I selected off the lunch menu (quite a selection for lunch).  I ordered the Poco Pollo Con Queso.  It is a golden brown chicken chimichanga topped with two kinds of cheese.  It comes with rice and I got black beans.  YUM!  It was really good.  The refills are drinks were fast and you did not have to ask.  The only weird thing was they took our bowl for the chips away.  I thought they were refilling it, it never made it back to our table.    I agree with Jacob L. the deco was WAY over the top.  Almost touristy.

I love this place!  I brought my first couches from them for our new house.  After 5 years the main couch, finally gave out.  Everyday use of us and the dogs.  We still have 1 two seat sofa that became the dogs' sofa now.  I am now back for maybe a dinner set, a new couch, or anything else I see... LOL!  Yes, they are pricey but the pieces are quality stuff.  FYI, they custom ordered our couches from Italy (we picked the heavier material and the color)...

Came here for 3 days straight  for The 22nd Annual Compete Through Service Symposium.   The Ritz Carlton staff is awesome!  The place was clean, VERY nice, but not as upscale as I thought it would be (compared to the other Ritz).  They do have a recovery service plan in process.  One of the microphones was going in and out, right away the got a new one.  POOF, DONE!

I love RED DOOR SPA.  It is a MUST trip at least 2x a year.  But this time I went to a different location to met up with my cousin.  We both had the milk and sugar body scrub, plus the 60 mins massage.  Love the location (upstairs).  Love the look of the place.  But the only thing missing was the bigger relaxation area and changing area.  Maybe because I am spoiled by the Wigwam location, but I like to lounge around a bit before and after my services.  Or course, the services is always top notch!!!

I have not been to this location since the last review in 2009!  Well M has been having a horrible 2 weeks.  She picked Cheesecake for lunch, I never say no to Cheesecake!!  We were quickly sitted.  Our server came over quickly to take drink orders...  I had to order the TexMex eggrolls too!    I got the Chicken Alfredo lunch.  It was very good, creamy and the noodles were done perfectly.  Only 1 minor complain, 5 chunks of chicken, REALLY?    Got my usual Vanilla Bean Cheesecake to top off the visit!!!

Went for lunch with coworkers.  Acutally we were looking for the Black Angus, but it was closed down.  So we headed up at Chili's.  I got the Ranch Chicken Sandwich.  It was good.  It is like a mild fried chicken with ranch on a sandwich.  If you like boneless wings, this is a treat!

Review 2/5/12 We were searching for a place to end the night with dessert.  We found Au Petit Four on Yelp and their were .4 miles from where we were.  COOL!  And we had their desserts before at the Esplanda location, so we know the the stuff is good.  Parking was almost impossible.  It is hard to find a space but we have a promise of good desserts so we grab the kids and walked.    They have only been in the new location for 6 weeks.  It was pretty nice.  So we all walked to the dessert case.  Everything looked good.  We settled on:  1 Coffee, 3 Bottled waters, 1 Lemonade, 1 mango cake, 2 creme brulees, 1 white chocolate cake, and 1 large chocolate chip cookie.  There wasn't a pricing for any of the things we ordered, so when he came to tell us our bill was $48.50.  We were shocked.  WHAT?  No detailed bill?  The kids were tired and we just wanted to leave.    10 items for $48.50 = Average $4.85 per item since we don't know the prices (non alcohol drinks and dessert)!  REALLY?????  I feel a little ripped off.

Update 3/22/12 - Judy B. has deleted the review.  Update 3/19/12 - Frenchie B. is user Judy B. now.    Updated 3/16/12:  First I was glad to see the owner private message regarding our experience there, that was nice.  But then I noticed the same user end "Frenchie B." wrote a review for Au Petit Four too.    Private Message:  "May be you were shocked by the price you paid, let me tell you we did not rise our price from the esplanade.  You 2 cakes and 2 creme brulee and they are the most expensive of the 10 items ingredients we use are very expensive and high quality.  You should ask the detail bill to Pierre there is no reason you did not have it.  Do not feel ripped off, I feel sorry, because you came over to Scottsdale, but I also Hope to see you again soon.  Thank you and have a nice week end."  Part of their review on 3/9/12 states: "Also,  if 50 dollars is to expensive for you after having 2 sodas especially the delicious lemonades who are from france so they are more expensive then a can of coke, 2 meals and 2 desserts then mcdonalds is better for you..price wise of course."   After review their review, I was shock to see how they think about their customers.  How 2 faced can you get.  Nice in the private message and then blast a customer on a public review.  If I would have had 2 drinks, 2 meals, and 2 desserts for $50, that is a great deal.  We had 5 non-alcoholic drinks, 4 desserts, and a cookie for $48.50.  You know, we should have taken the kids to McDonalds for dessert.    To read the rest of Frenchie B.'s review:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/au-petit-four-scottsdale#hrid:b6f4KzsK5ApkWZxLumt-SA

I came here with a group of 20 for a work lunch.  Due to time constraints we ordered our lunches ahead.  I ordered the chicken con-fit but they change the item out.  They emailed our person that was setting up the lunch and notify me that they have grilled turkey breast served with butternut squash puree, brussel sprouts with crispy bacon, and a cranberry relish.  They sounded deli-sh, so I was OK with the change.  Boy, the change was welcome when I had my first taste.  OMG, everything was SO SO SO GOOD.  The service was excellent!

I never knew Barb's was this close to my work!  The cupcakes are very reasonable priced (less than $1.5 to $2.25 each) and they are decorated so CUTE.    I bought all chocolates (2 chocolate, 2 brownie sundae, and 2 red velvet)!  They have much more than just cupcakes!  Cakes, brownies, donuts, etc.  Anything baked!!!    The employees are so nice and helpful too!

A group of us went there for the cafe and let the kids looks at the books.  I am just going to review the cafe.  We were all reviewing the menu, I have not been there in a LONG time.  She was very annoyed that we did not know what we wanted.  CHILL!  I ordered a medium green tea latte.  She was very rude and loud, DO YOU HAVE A BORDER'S CARD?  She prepared my drink.  It was so hot, I had to wait 5 full mins before drinking it.  When I picked the cup also thought it was very light.  The cup was only 3/4 filled? WTF?  The drink was good but the service and quantity in the cup was a totally disappointment.

Came here for HH with some friends.  Love the vibe and feel to the place.  Our server was excellent!!!  One of the best servers I have had in a LONG time.  Chicago-Style Spinach Dip with salsa, sour cream and warm tortilla chips:  the dip is so creamy and flavorful.  Too good to NOT order.  Special App for the day-Brushetta:  I am not sure what kind of cheese or oils was used, but it was too good to stop at one!  Famous French Dip:  Melts in your mouth and the au jus sauce was perfect not too salty.

I absolutely love this place.  When you pull up and valet, does not feel like you are in AZ anymore.  It feels like you are somewhere exotic (Mediterranean).  The rich earthy colors are just so warm and welcoming.  Love it!  I ordered the Pan roasted halibut for dinner.  It is served with a fine herb potato gallette, sautéed mushrooms & vegetables with red wine butter sauce.  Too yummy for words to explains.  You need to try it out for yourself.  Just too terrific!!  I picked the Chocolate Fantasy (French chocolate silk on a decadent chocolate cake with chocolate sauce served with vanilla gelato) for my after dinner pleasure.  Again, too yummy for words.  This is the perfect place for the perfect date, anniversary dinners, and any romantic event.  Just one of the best dinner experiences that I have had.

This plaza is always packed around lunch time. I try to get here before 11:30am to avoid the lunch RUSH. This Schlotzsky's is clean, employees are nice, and they have food to you pretty quickly.   My favie is the sourdough angus pastrami & swiss. SO good. And the pizza meal deal for lunch is a great choice too.

I have been driving by over and over, never thought to stop.  Until a friend told me they have awesome cakes.  I buy one and brought it to my in-laws.  They thought it was fantask.  The presentation was beautiful and tasted like sin.    So I returned to try their breakfast.  OMG!  I should have gone sooner!!  I loved the Commuter Sandwich with turkey.  YUMMY!  The LGO organic oatmeal was so decilious.  Need to go back to try the pancakes.  They looks and smelled so good.    Just thinking about it make me want to drool....

I have not been here in awhile, so I thought since I am in the area I will pick up a lunch togo.  I ordered the sesame chicken lunch special (chicken, rice, and an egg roll).  I bought it back to the office, it smelled good and the togo box was stuff with food.  I wished it tasted as good as it smelled.  The sauce was kind of bland.  I was so bummed.  I guess I need to find another chinese take out place.

This cute place is tucked in the back of the plaza (walking distance to AJ's).  When I got there it was starting to get packed.  Thank goodness M was there a few mins earlier than me.  I was quickly greeted by the server and he took my drink order.    I ordered the country ham served on a croissant with melted cheddar and mozzarella cheese, served with a side of hash browns.  And had to order a single buttermilk pancake.  Everything was very good.  The server was good.    Cons - the table was so small, our plates did not fit, they had to remove some stuff off the table.  And the chairs are not comfy.

I probably should have yelped it before I went there.  But I was on the road and craving a rice bowl.  The place is dark (makes it dingy for me) and it was so quite for a lunch crowd.  Ordered the house chicken togo.  The taste of the sauce was weird...  not to garlicy, just blah...  Very disappointed...  Never going back!

I have only been to the west side location.  I offered to buy breakfast for my team that has been doing a kick a$$ job at work.  So, I decided to visit the original location.  I got the machaca with egg and potatoes.  I did not know it did not come with cheese, so it was a little dry but still good!

I have been here a few times for lunch and loved it.  I finally came here for dinner with the family, early Mother's Day gift for my MIL.  Loved the old saloon (bar), it is so old west.  We sat in the back room.    Every dinner seating comes with cornbread muffins and baking soda biscuits.  The cornbread had a kick to them, I think some kind of peppers were in them.  The baking soda biscuits were good!!!  The boys had the wild boar and venison sausages for appetizers.  They said it was very very good.  I passed!  We also got the garlic toast for appetizers too.  Yummy, warm, right amount of butter, and not burnt!    I ordered the new york strip with bearniase sauce on the side and parmesan potato stack as the side.  The NY strip was cooked perfectly and tasted very very good.  I liked that I could taste the beef flavor, it was a good cut of meat.  YUM YUM!  The parmeasan potato stack was excellent!  Everyone else enjoyed their meals too (prime rib - cowboy cut, calves liver, top sirlion, and crunchy fried shrimp platter).    We worked our way to dessert too:  Mixed berry shortcake and chocolate chip fudge brownie.  Both desserts were so so so so SO GOOD!

I have been going to this location for lunch on and off for years!  I love the Abacus chicken special, #8 on the lunch menu.  YUMMY!  The lunch is super fast, super good, and a reasonable price.  It comes with soup (egg drop or hot and sour soup), you get fried wonton chips, your meal includes 1 egg roll, 1 fried wonton, fried rice, and your selection.  I have never tried anything else off the menu.  Abacus chicken - I am hooked!

This place gets packed for lunch to get there before noon!  We were quickly seated and then our server got our drink orders.  The green ice tea is right on.  The real stuff!!  I got the #4 Chicken Cutlet (Panko Fried Chicken with Tonkatsu sauce).  Most lunches are served with Miso soup, salad and rice.  I got everything of the lunch except for the rice.  I thought the lunch did not come with rice so I just eat what I got, until I looked it up on the website.  HUM?  Either way, the service was great, food was great, and the prices are reasonable!!!

I have not been to Nello's in ages.  A friend suggested for lunch.  The three of us show up and the place was getting busy.  We were sat immediately.  Got to have pizza here, right?  We ordered a large pizza:  thick crust, bacon, basil, mushroom, and 1/2 with sausage.  OMG... It was good but they forgot the basil.  =(  The garlic bread was very good too....    The waiter was eye candy and he provided great service!  =)

I have been to many different CPK locations. This is the worst of them. I do not know if it was an off night or what. But our server Dee, did his best with what he got to work with.   1. Ordered drinks, no problem. Just out of lemons for the ice tea. When our drinks came, the long island ice tea had a lemon on it but not the regular ice tea. After 1 min, our friend notice a hair stuck to the inside of her glass on the long island. She was freaked out. They replaced her drink and apologized.  The replacement long island has a lemon.  Hum, out of lemons?  2. Tried to order appetizers, they are out of the avocado club egg rolls, tortilla spring rolls, and Singapore shrimp rolls. We ordered the chicken pot stickers. The server was not sure if they had any left, he had to check. We were lucky, they had some pot stickers left.   3. We ordered our pizzas and was informed it is a 20 min wait.   Not once a manager stopped by to check our visit. Especially with the hair issue. Food was good, service was good, managing the restaurant's supply for food sucks (out of food), and management for customer satisfaction was lacking. No coming back to this location again. The Biltmore location is my favorite.

We went in for drinks and sweets. We were notified immediately that the kitchen closes at 10pm. OK, cool! 3 of us ordered drinks and I ordered sweets. They said the beers were OK. I ordered the warm donut holes, those suckers are good. Service was average. Us girls went to the restrooms and wow... It is gross. SO GROSS! I decided to wait until we got home (and that is a 30 min drive).

Came here for a friend's surprise b-day party.  The manager and staff was so awesome.  They put us in the a private room in the back.  They took our cake to the back. Let us set up the area a little for the b-day girl.  The service was excellent.  The food was great too.  I got the mac and cheese side dish & roasted macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi.

Parking sucked a little.  Parked in central Scottsdale (joking).  It was a walk.  Anyways, the theater is nice, clean, and has various of movies to pick from.  Got our tickets, got our seats, and enjoyed the movie.

My mom dragged me to Macy's the day after Thanksgiving.... NO!!!  The crowds.  My mom, YES....the sales.  We got there at 5pm.  Not a lot of people.  She was happy that they still had deals.  She bought a lot of Christmas gifts and saved too.  I found a sweater for myself for $14.99 and then I have a $10 coupon.  I paid around a little over $5.  Sweet!  Employees were hard to find in the store...

I was invited to a banquet dinner for about 50 to 60 people.  Problem is the place didn't provide mircrophones so the organizer's were speaking loudly to get audience's attention.  The tables were spaced very far from each other.  The organizer's pre-selected the dishes for the dinner:  Miced Beef Soup - It was ok the cilatro over powered the taste of the soup Hong Kong Walnut Shrimp - The walnuts were not fresh Sliced Abalone with Black Mushrooms - Good taste  Whole Roasted Duck - The duck was very fatty (more than normal) Beef and Black Pepper - It was ok, a little bland Pork Chop with Peking Sauce - This dish was the best Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice - The lettuce was not finely cut, so the large chucks made the dish soggy Fish fried and stir fried - This was very good  Why the 2 stars?  The service sucked!  They didn't tell you what dish it is when they bring it out.  And you wait forever for refills.  And when someone on the our table asked for a bag, they pointed to the station for us to get it ourselves.  And the place was SUPER HOT!  The air kicked on every once in awhile.  Didn't expect to eat in 90 degree weather.

We checked out the prices at The Dump, the sales person there just were too pushy. and their prices were not the lowest.  We checked out the prices at Mattress Firm to see if they were any cheaper.  We had a wonderful experience!  The salesperson was friend and helpful NOT pushy at all.  They had the i-select model bed that my friend was looking for.  They were $200 cheaper, delivery was cheaper, and free tempur pedic pillows.  SOLD!!!  My friend is happy as a customer.

I have always liked Houston's (even when it was on Camelback and 24th St.).  We came here on a Saturday night, hoping the wait was not too long.  It was about 20 mins, but a lot of folks waiting in the front area.  The servers are always top notch.  They know the menu well especially if you are dining with someone with allergies.  SPINACH & ARTICHOKE DIP -  "Chicago-style" with salsa and sour cream:  It is so good.  MUST order for an appetizer.    HAWAIIAN RIB-EYE - Pineapple sesame ginger marinade, grilled over hardwood, & loaded baked potato: The marinade for the rib-eye is so flavorful and make light crispy rust on the rib-eye.  The loaded baked potato is great with everything on it!

I love it!  But of course my crazy cousin and I were part of the crowd that works out on a Saturday from 9pm to midnight...  We were did the spa, lunch, shopped, dinner, and then to work off all the food...  My first time there as a guest.  It was clean, smells good, and has all the equipment you can think of.  We did cardio for 50 mins, weight machines/exercise ball for 50 mins. and swam for 50 mins.  I could barely drove home!  Good times!

Came here looking for an office mat.  Bonus it was on sale, YEAH!  I got the mat and got to the cashier.  He seemed off.  He could not scan or read the barcode, so he ask if he could cut it tape and roll the office mat.  I said I did not mind if he taped it back.  He looked at me like really.  Yes, really!  I can't carry or fit the mat in my car if it was unfolded.  He sighed and went to the area of the mats to look up the barcode.  He seemed unhappy about that.

All PPP have the same layout.  This one I have to say is cleaner than the others.  Kids are everywhere!!!  The pizza was not bad.  The wings are not too bad either.  They did an excellent job on my friend kid's birthday.  The person dedicated to the party she got every detail down and timed it just right.  Everyone had a great time.

Sunday morning before 11am we were there and it was packed to the gills at this IHOP. OMG, the waiting area inside was full, the wait area in between the inside and outside doors were full and the entrance has about 4 people stand around. WOW! We waited about 20 mins for 5 of us.   The menus were sticky and mine had a smashed paper liner of a straw in it. The table looked clean and the seats were redone. The place got HOT, there was a lot of people.   I got the ham and cheese omelet. It was a little dry. The french toast was pretty good.   All in all, meh....

My mama wanted pizza, so I was like Old Chicago?  So away we went.  The parking lot has quite a few cars but still plenty of parking.  We were greeted as soon as we walked into the doors.  We got seated instantly and our server introduced herself and took our drink orders.  Then our drinks were brought and took our food orders.  She asked if we wanted our wings as an appetizer or with our pizza.  Appetizer please!  We got the mild buffalo style wings and a NY style crust "the Classic" toppings.  The wings came and they were good.  Then the pizza, thin crust and tasty toppings (Loads of pepperoni, mushrooms, Italian sausage, roasted garlic and Mozzarella).    Service was great and good was great!!  =)

Trash can for the kitchen. .   What to pick!  Simplehuman (I think it is referring to my husband, HA)  is the only brand I saw there.  We had a stain steel trash can and our dog loves.  He can step on the foot level and he can go through the trash.  We loved the stain steel ones but they did not have a pet lock.  Only the black matted style had it, so got it.  We are happy but our dog is not.  =)

One of my favie drinks are the Pure Cholocate Ice Blended with whip cream and Green Tea Latte.  The service is always friendly, perky, and fully of sunshine.

I received a coupon by email (buy $25 worth get $10 off) to go to Yankee Candle. I normally get my Yankee Candle from Bed, Bath, and Beyond. I figure since I am in the mall what the heck. I stepped into the place and all the smells hit me all at once. I had to look for my favie Vanilla Cupcake or the Christmas cookie. Love those smells.   I walked out with a large jar of the vanilla cupcake and 3 car scents (of course vanilla cupcake). Ummmm..............

Yummy burgers!!!  I got the triple cheese burger (I love my cheese).  Well done of course.  My dad and Uncle tried the buffalo and kobe burgers.  My mom stuck with a regular cheese burger.  They loved the fresh ingredients bar.  And then they discovered the melted cheese....  They loved it for their fries.    We had a great time sitting in a round table so we can enjoy each other company and communicate.

The food was good.  Got the trio-sampler:  Southwest eggrolls, chicken wings, and potato skin.  I got the chicken enchilda soup.

Went here for lunch, big mistake.  The nice is decked out nice for a strip-mall but the food just was not happening.  2 stars because the service was excellent.    I got the Fettucine Alfredo with chicken.  The sauce was watery.  Alfredo watery?  Really?  The chicken was a good flavor, but the running sauce just takes away from the chicken.  And the parmesan cheese is on the table not freshly grated.  No thanks!

I ordered at the drive thur, got the order taken and confirmed all the items I ordered.  Paid for the food and got a receipt back that is blurred and not sure what they are charging or what I ordered.  Oh well, I drove forward.  The guy says hello and then informs me that the chicken sandwich will be more than a 5 min wait so I need to park the car in the front of the store.  OK, the wait was about 6 mins but when I got home....we were missing fries and a drink.  =(

We ducked out and was hiding from Trick or Treaters on Halloween (even though we had 15 bags of freaking candy).  Great, we are going to be known as that house.  =(  We were surprised that they were getting packed!!  I guess we were not the only ones ducking.  he he he...  We were quoted a 15 min wait.  We were sat in 15 mins, so cool!  The server was friendly and helpful.  I show him my b-day coupon and he noted it down.  He came back with our drink orders quickly and then took our food order.  He was so attentive through the dinning experience.    Loaded Potato Skins:  Ok, a little bland. Top Sirloin Center-Cut:  It was good, the quality of the steak was ok.   The two sides:  Western Wild Rice - Good    Au Grain Potato - Good, but a tad too salty for my taste  The 4 stars is because of the server, he surprised me with a warm cookie & ice cream.  He remember due to the coupon I showed him in the beginning.  That was so cool of him.

Been to this location about several times in the few years and have always had great food and great service.   Have had the BBQ Chicken Pizza, love the bbq sauce they use for the pizza.  Pasta Milano is still one of my favorites, the roasted garlic cream sauce brings the chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and pasta together!!!  The grilled pork chops are always good, the balsamic glaze is tasty!  Do not like their chicken parm too much, the sauce is too overpowering.  The tiramisu and smothered chocolate cake are good.

My husband and I stopped by for lunch today.  OMG, the portion on the Pasta Milano shrank by almost 1/2 the size.  WTF?  The price is still the same, it taste the same, but cames in a small bowl.  I remember the Pasta Milano came in this huge bowl and I never finish the dish.  There are always leftovers.  My husband the pizza, it was good and the same size.  The server did not even ask if we wanted dessert before he handed us the bill.  After the food came, he only checked on us once to hand us the bill.  Very disappointment!!!

Went for dinner with my brother and my mom. We are all disappointed. We rather have spend the money at Tagliani down the street. The place had no more than 8 tables of customers. So you expect you would have more attention from your server. NOPE. My brother noticed the portion of the food was extremely smaller, but the prices are the same. Everything was just OK tasting.   I do not think I will be back...due to the service and quantity of food you get.

This is not my normal Target but I stopped by since I was ordering pizza at the Naked Pizza.  They are re-modeling so things are kinda of crazy in there.  Not one employee greeted me or asked if I needed help.  It is hard to find things at this place.  I hope the place is nice, neat, and better when they finish remodeling.

I rarely go to Wendy's, but my hubby wanted it.  So we got take out for lunch.  The place was packed.  The drive thur line was LONG (about 8 cars ahead).  Place the order, paid, and 30 seconds POOF the entire was  ready.    Ordered: MONTEREY RANCH CRISPY CHICKEN SANDWICH (Crispy fillet of all-white meat chicken topped with Monterey Jack, fresh lettuce and zesty ranch sauce.) from the $0.99 menu.  It is not bad!!  Chicken was crispy (I know it is processed) still not bad with the ranch and cheese.  BACONATOR Applewood Smoked Bacon piled high atop a 1/4 lb. patty of fresh with sliced American cheese and mayo.  Ok, the bacon is good and it brings out the beef.  All these things together are HUM-GOOD.    FRIES They are ok.

Never been here before.  So we were greeted when we walked in.  Of course, we bee lined is to the gifts area.  This nice lady greeted us and asked if we were looking for something.  We showed us the area and different ideas for the gift.  I finally decided on a long sleeve jacket.

I have been to different Taglianis, but this is my first visit to this location.  You can easier drive by and not notice it.  I love LOVE the 14th Street pizza here.  That is all I get when I come to Taglianis.  Our server was swamped with tables at once and she was the hostess/servers all in one.  But she still provided fast and friendly service.  She still had time to check on each table at least 3 to 4 times throughout the dining experience.    I guess I will need to try other dishes sometime soon.

We came here to celebrate my brother and my husband's birthdays.  We will never pick this place again.  The service was SO slow and the food was mediocre at best.  We only had 1 red crunched pepper between 9 people.  The jar was passed back and forth throughout the dinner.  Supremo Italiano - It was only thing good from this dinner but not the BEST pizza   (spicy Italian sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mozzarella, provolone and meat sauce)  Chicken & Sausage Ziti - This dish was so watered down.  Tasteless!  HORRIBLE.  (chicken breast, mild Italian sausage, red onions, roma tomatoes and spinach in garlic cream sauce)  Linguine Frutti di Mare - This dish was ok.  (shrimp, baby clams, mussels and calamari in spicy red clam sauce)  Spaghetti with Meatballs - This was another tasteless dish.  The meatballs was horrific.  The meat was low grade and after eating it, I lost my appetite.  I don't think it was meat at all.  YUCK!  We waited 45 mins for tasteless dishes.....   And spend a couple hundred of dollars.

I think I have been here before...Where is my review from that?  Who knows?  Anyways, we waited 20 mins for a table for 4 on a Saturday night at 7pm.  Not too bad considering the place was PACKED with people.    I wanted prime rib and they are OUT.  Bummer.  So I got the New York Strip with mash potato with cheese and bacon, and buttery corn.  It was good.  The bread and cinnamon butter is the BOMB.  The service was great.  Why the 4 stars?  How can you be out of prime rib?

I came with my brother and his gf later in the night.  There was still a tons of food out.  I have to admit I am not a salad eater!  I tagged along and go the soup, pasta, and baked goods.  The chicken noodle is GOOD, got seconds!  I tried some chicken/beef meatball soup, no thanks.  The mac and cheese was not too shabby.  The baked muffins, cornbread, etc. was good.  And of course the soft serve!  :)  The experience was topped off by the service.  The server keep checking on us and gave is pointers on what to try.

They were the only airlines that fly from PHX to Long Beach so I had to buy a ticket from US Airways.  I was so excited to go to CA for one of my BFFs wedding shower.  2 days before my flight out, I did not feel well.  I went to urgent care and found out I had bronchitis.  I called the airlines and they told me that the change fee is $150 for tickets that cost less than $140.  I mentioned to the agent that the change fee is more than my ticket, she said "OH it is cheaper for you to purchase a new ticket." and snickered.  WTF!  Really, snickering at a customer?

I fought against purchasing tickets to Hawaii on US Airways.  Because they have also give me issues.  1 day before our trip to Hawaii, US Airways sends me an email to check in.  So I clicked on the button and found that my name is not on the any of the tickets anymore.  WHAT????  WTF????  I called the #800.  10 mins into the auto menu, the system says they have overwhelming call and told me to call back later.  And hangs UP!  WHAT?  I need to be on the flight tomorrow.  Called them back in 5 mins.  And I have been on HOLD for an agent for over 1 hour.  This is ridiculously!  After wasting over 1 hour of my life on hold, come to find out it is a system glitch.  REALLY!

This place is on our girl's brunch list. We have been coming to this location on and off for years... Get there early, sometimes the wait can be a little long. The service overall has been good.   Country Combo Omelets - Ham, sausage, and bacon with jack and sharp cheddar.... YUM!   Pancakes and French Toast are so fluffy and GOOD.   They also have a large selection for healthier choices too.

Loved it here for lunch. Must come back for dinner.   Ordered the Cafe Clubhouse Sandwich for lunch (sliced ham and turkey breast, bacon, provolone, swiss, and mayonnaise on a ciabatta square) served with fresh seasonal fruit. The first bite into the sandwich was AWESOME! The combination of the meats, cheese, and bread was SO good. The bacon crunch put it over the top. The fruit was delicious. For those that know me, I ATE fruit and I like it! So sweet and fresh. WOW!   The service was great. She was quick to refill on drinks. She even got splitting the checks correct.   Once one mini con, the parking. But for this place, I will park anywhere!

This place is HUGE!  It was so much fun to go to the Hollywood costumes event.  It was nice, big, and informative.  Lots of bling, lights, and costumes.  Loved the behind the scenes why and how the costumes were picked.  We finished the event and was allowed to wander around the rest of the place.  After 2 hours here, I don't think we saw everything.....

Went there for lunch with a coworker. It was pretty crowd. We were sat down quickly. My chair was pretty dirty, so I wiped it down with napkins. This place is a hole in the wall, but the pho and rice plates are good.   Love number #41 (BBQ pork with rice); the egg roll; and a soy milk. I am a happy camper. Love the #1 Pho!

Got there at 11am on a Sunday, it was packed to the gills. WOW! I should have listened to Michele M. We ordered shrimp dumplings, roasted pork, bbq steamed buns, turnip cakes, shrimp egg rolls, chicken feet, spare ribs, steam sticky rice with meats, fried tofu, egg tarts, etc... Everything was good. This is the best dim sum you can get in Phoenix.

I have eaten at many Romano's Macaroni in and out of AZ.  The quantity and quality of the food has been decreasing over the years.  I am very bummed out about this.  During lunch, my brother and I ordered dinner portions.  When the food came out it was more like lunch portions.  1/2 a chicken breast for the chicken parm and a handful of noodles on a huge plate.  My pasta milano was 1/2 the portion from previous visits.  Our server was awesome, attentive our entire visit.

I phoned in the order for pick up, he quoted 10 mins.  I got there and told him I was here for a pick up.  Ok, he took off to the back.  I heard plastic bags wrestling and he came out with my order.  It was nice he put it in a box so the soup does not spill.  Not the service was totally lacking, no hello, double checking if the order was correct, or even saying a word to me.    House Special Chicken Bowl - It did not come in a bowl, small portion of chicken, huge portion of the garlic sauce, and a small amount of rice.  It was ok.  Egg Flower Soup - It was bland, so bummed.

Dr Schick is super awesome.  She figure out what my Akita mix had.  Special skin condition that only Akita's had.  Thank goodness it is not contagious since I have two other dogs at home.  She is truly interested in getting your dog well and she is also great with humans too.  Wasabi and I have been coming here for over 1 year now.  Wasabi is happy to have her shiny coat back and ears/nails looking much better.  Thank you!

Love this museum in Mesa.  It was free admission, great AC, and great exhibits:    1.  Boundless - Books transformed in contemporary art 2.  Fold, Paper, Scissors - Precisely cut paper "drawings" to mathematically mind-boggling folds to a single sheet of paper 3.  Betsy Douglas - modern silver designs to computer circuit board jewelry

I came here for a birthday party.  It was so much fun.  We were greeted by the front desk.  They informed us that our host were not there yet, but we were welcome to roam around the place.  They had arts and crafts everywhere.  Interesting facts and information on the walls.  When our host arrived we follow our guide to a back area (filled with trees and tables/chairs for outdoor activities) and then to a building in the back for our party.  We had the whole back building to ourselves.  It was nice!  Tables, chairs, and art canvases/art supplies all set up.  Signs wishing our birthday girl (with her name on it).  The room has it's own bathrooms so you do not need to run back to the main building.  We had 1-1/2 hours in the back room.  Then we were free to enjoy the museum.  There are two separate areas arts/craft & play/learn room.  I had fun along with the kids.

I made an appointment online three days before I was planning to go drop off the car for re-balancing and rotation.  Showed up on-time for the appointment, but they were so busy it took them 10 mins before anyone came out to help me.  I told them I had an appointment.  They found me on the computer, confirm what services I wanted done and then I was off on my way.  I dropped off the car, so I could not tell you how long it took them.  The facility was clean and service person was professional and nice.

This place is truly a miracle in the desert!  13 of us came to volunteer to clean and shine the dinning hall, kitchen, and stock the supply rooms.  We cleaned, scrubbed, vaccumed, stocked, swiped, etc. for a few hours.  The staff was very friendly and appreciate our time and support.  We got to watch a video to learn more about the facility and they offered a tour too.  Hopefully our few hours brighted someone's day.  I learned:  They do not turn away childern for finanical reasons.  They do not receive goverment support for the children and though we they donor funded, they do not fundraise or soliciate for themselves.    Mission statement:  Our Mission is to provide a loving, wholesome, Christian home for children who are separated from their parents and help them establish long-term relationships with stable parental figures, preparing them for success in adult life. Sunshine Acres is more than a home, we are family.

Came here to meet with friends after the comedy show.  Like a mini high school reunion.  Maybe I am not in my 20s anymore and like the dingy bar atmosphere anymore.  Wow.... The place is dirty, sticky, and just ek.  The restroom on my, it was scary.  The service was horrible to top off the experience.

Love the outside patio.  We only get another month of this before we go back inside with AC to eat.  Chairs and table were a little dusty, but then again we are outside.  :)  The caprese was very good.  The mozzarella and basil were drizzled in olive oil and great!  The fresh cheese made in house was melts in your mouth.  Yes, I skipped the tomatoes.  Then we had the pizza.  It is was very good, too bad it was a little soggy but the taste of the fresh ingredients made up for it.  OH.  The tiramisu was very very very good.  Not too sweet, the taste of the dessert was not overpowering.  Just right!

Came here to see my high school friend Warren B. Hall!  He is so funny.  We were greeted at the door, we got to pick a table close to the stage.  The server was great.  One bad thing, not enough bathrooms.  They opened up to the Venue side to let us use the bathrooms but they were gross.  I don't think they cleaned it from Saturday night...  EKKKK....

I was shoe shopping and LOVE that you get an employee to ask if you need help.  I found a shoe I liked... (HOT PINK) but he did not have my size, but brought a different color to try for size but they shipped (free shipping) from another location that had my size.  Plus he brought out other alike styles my size to see if I wanted anything else...  AWESOME!

I have never been to Tiffany's before.  I have always walked by and wondered about it.  This time I tagged along with my brother and his fiance!  They are getting her ring re-sized.  It was so exciting!!!  We walked in and I was slumming it (jeans and a tank top).  We were greeted and the sales lady that helped my brother was smiling at them.  We were greeted by other folks, so far everyone is good.  We got to customer service and sat in the chairs waiting.  Their associates were busy in the customer service, another associate came to ask what we are here for and got the information she needed.  We were offered cold water too.  She got the ring had had the fiance to try it.  Sweet!  It was a good experience.  I think I might come back for something myself...  Hum!

I could remember Tokyo Expresses were everywhere in the valley.  I loved their food.  I was surprise to see them around and excited to eat the food again.  We entered the place and it smelled like bleach.  STRONG.  It is ok.  We move to the menu and ordering area.  Everyone picked out their meal.  Ordered and sat down.  We got our food pretty quickly.  I got the Katsu Chicken meal (side sui may and drink).  The sauce in the Katsu was kinda of bland.  I remember the sauce was savory.  The sui may, I am sure was the pre-made frozen kind.  I was hungry so I ate it.

We had a party of 28 to celebrate the annual J&J Bday Bash.  I loved the Yelp party experience, I am so torn on the # of stars!!!  This is a 3-1/2 stars review.  The service was 5 stars hands down.  Our server was more than I can ask for.  The food was ok, barely a 3.    French Onion Soup - It was cheesy, onion-y, and bread-y, but a little saltier than I like.  Ned Colletti's Chicken Schnitzel with lemon butter sauce - The chicken was a little dry and the lemon butter sauce was ok.  The baked potato was ok.    The service was so fabulous!!  Maybe I should have gotten a steak?

The staff at this place is super nice and extremely accommodating.  Our representative was Teresa M., she is awesome.  She explained all the different options and choices.  Holly crap, I did not realize that were that many different choices.  She took the time to listen, then explain and show us the difference between the plans.  She made the experience pleasant for an unpleasant topic.

They have root beer in pony kegs!  This place is nuts!  I bought 4 different flavors of cream soda.  WOW!  It was the most different varieties of sodas that I have ever seen in one place.  Too much things for my mind to process.  Must go back to take in all the things going on.

What a happening place on a Tuesday night!!!!  We had 10 of us show up after work.  Ok, parking SUCKED!  I parked like 1/4 mile away...  But when you get finally walk there it is busy but tons of places to sit inside and outside.  Our server was the bomb.  She was on top of the drinks.  All our food came out right and tasted GREAT!    I ordered the French Dip.  The bread, beef, and melting cheese was good and the Au Jus sauce has flavor...  The beer batter fries was just ok.  There are a lot of other items on the menu that looks great too.  I can't wait to come back and try it.

What happened to this place? This was our college hang out. I stopped in for a happy hour with my college buddies... NOT the same. The happy hour buffet SUCKED! We ended up ordering appetizers. They tasted ok... Not much of a drink special. Oh, we were very disappointed... I guess the next college get together will be somewhere else...

Our annual Christmas gift ornament was held  at the House of Tricks.  I loved the outside patio.  6 of us sat near a heat lamp and it was perfect.  The service was a little slow and she refilled one of our drinks wrong, but that is OK.  She fixed it right away.  I ordered the Oven Roasted Turkey Club (Brown Sugar Bacon, Tomato, Avocado, Havarti, and Honey-Dijonaise) on Sourdough served with Tri-Color Pasta Salad.  The sandwich was great, especially the crunch of the brown sugar bacon.  YUM!  The Tri-Color Pasta Salad was ok, because it had onions.  Not too fond of onions.    Overall it is 3-1/2 stars, but the patio seating bumped it up to 4 stars.

I have only been this to location for lunch several times. The experience is always been wonderful. Quick and friendly service every time. The quality of the food is good but not great. I am a fan but I would not have a craving and drive out to get it.   Pad-Prew-Wan (Thai Sweet 'n Sour) - Got it with chicken - Good   Pad-Thai with chicken - The tangy sweet sauce was not as good as other Thai places.

I have not been there for awhile, just had lunch there today and I was disappointed.  It was hot, noisy, and the flavor of the food has gone down.  What a bummer!  I got the lunch special BBQ Pork, with fried rice, and a thai ice tea.  Got the veggie soup, it was salty and very peppery.  Ok, moving on to the lunch plate it was the same as before but the taste of the sauces is watered down or something,  It was just not as flavorful as I remember!  The egg roll was meh, diffent than the thai egg rolls I have had before at other places.  The Thai Ice tea was the only thing that had good and strong flavor.    Maybe it was a miss today?

Have no idea why my dad picked this place for his bday.  His bday, his choice.    There are many many things to choose from:  cold foods, hot foods, sushi, pizza, soups, ice cream, etc.  So everyone has something to eat.    Some of the items were sitting awhile, so it was dry (usual in a buffet).  They did replaced high moving items pretty quickly.  The tables and napkin holders were a little gross (sticky and clearly not have been cleaned in a long time).  We sat by the raw food selection (I guess they have another type of buffet - cook it yourself), and it was covered by huge sheets of white boards and the boards did not fit to cover all the foods.  I can see some of it was raw seafood, not too good.  The server was kind of rude or a language barrier.  She asked for our drinks but when we ask what kind of drinks they offer she didn't say, she asked again what do you want to drink.

8 of us went on the Saturday afternoon to celebrate birthdays.  I called ahead for a reservation, I hear the place is small and gets packed.  I should have bought the GPS, but I thought I was going to use my sense to get there.  Circled a little and found out the street does not go through the Glendale library is in the way!  LOL!  We ordered 12 pierogi (mixed).  They are so so SO good.  We ordered sandwiches, sausages, cabbage wrapped something, etc...  Everything was so delicious!  Loved the atmosphere of the owners interacting with the customers.

The little old lady that does the alternation is so cute and sweet.  She reminds me of my grandma.  This place reminds me of the oversea tailor shops.  I got two pairs of pants shortened.  Yes, I am vertically challenged.  I brought them in on a Friday, she asked me when I needed them.  I was not in a rush, so I told her when you can get them done.  She said Wed. anytime.  They fit perfect now...  :)

My two dogs loves Alejandra (groomer) at this store.  They are pretty picky with who touches and pets them.  When we drop them off, she takes good care of them.  They always come back happy, nicely groomed, smelling good, and CLEAN!  We have been with her for over 2 years now.    The store is always clean and the retail staff is always available to answer questions.  The prices are cheaper than Petco.

We just rescued a dog, she was abused by other dogs, and scared.  She is only 1-1/2 years and 73lbs but the sweetest dog.  Today was she first time getting groomed, so we told Alejandra she might be scared.  At first she did not want to go even with our other dog going with her, but after she saw that we left from the groom area she hustled and went with Alejandra.  Alejandra said she did just great but I am sure Alejandra's extra love and attention helped.  Now, I can say our 3 dogs just love her!!  If you need a groomer, Alejandra is AWESOME!  It was very nice that I found all the new things for our new dog.  Pink pawed collar with a match leash and other goodies.  This store always has the friendliest employees.  The cashier was great too.  She tried to give our new one a treat, but she was too interested with the store.

I was referred to come here by my sister in-law. They loved the staff and service. We have been bring our 2 Akita mixes to Estrella for 4 years now (since our fuzzy kids) were pups. The fuzzy kids love the staff and have stayed in the boarding services too. They staff recognize the dogs every time we go and calls them by their names.  Also we were clients of their puppy training class.    They even took us in (just showing up), because my baby girl had a bump on her head.  They squeezed us in and took great care of my baby girl.

I walked in the store to grab dinner.  I had not had my fried chicken fix in awhile.  I have a coupon for 10 chicken tenders with 2 sides.  Then I got a call from my husband that he wanted fried chicken not the tenders, so since I already placed my order I had to order a family dinner with sides and the honey butter biscuits.    The staff was friendly and funny.  A dine-in customer question why is the chicken breast so small.  The girls said yes that is the size of our breast, our wings are normal huge compare to the other stores (KFC).  Then all 3 of us locked eyes and laughed.  The staff said I just said my breast is small.  LOL!!!    The fried chicken was good, crispy (both tenders and original).  The corn on the cob was just buttery and no flavor.  The mash potatoes were ok.  The honey butter biscuits were yumtastic!  I know, I think my heart stopped beating for a few mins after the my meal.

I thought I have written a review already, but nope! OK, this is my 3rd trip to Raul and Theresa's. The first time, food and service was good. The second time, food was just bl-eh and service was good. Third time, both food and service was excellent. Gloria is the bomb!! Woot woot...   I had the chimi again and Gloria asked if I wanted it with sauce and cheese on top (the first 2 times, they never asked). It was VERY good with the extras on top, WOW!!!. The queso dip with shredded beef was AWESOME!!!! I could not stop eating it. The chips just kept coming!!! Hubby ordered a steak picado with corn tortilla, he LOVED it.

I went there this afternoon to get gift certificates, but when walking in and smelling the waffles I added a like it to the list.  The employee was so so NICE.  He was helping two other customers, and shouted HELLO when I walked in.  I greeted him back.  The two customers was waiting for him to finish their order.  Customer #1 was easy, Customer #2 she was can I have this and that.  She was pretty difficult, but the employee was nice to her still.  When it was my turn, he was so friendly and chatting.  He was fast in getting the order done.  Love it... Fast, Done, and Right!

This is my MIL's nail place and since her birthday is coming up, I thought a GC to her nail place would be a great gift.  It place is pretty small.  It is tucked in between two other stores, I missed it the first time.  I walked in and was greeted by the lady employee doing a manicure on a customer.  I told her I needed a GC.  She stopped the manicure and helped me.  I noticed the place only had 6 pedicure chairs and 3 to 4 nail stations, but only 2 employees.  I can see why they are slow.

Parking is limited or park on the street.  This is a coffee joint with food, desserts, alcohol, etc.  Came here to hang with a friend.  The place was packed inside and out.  We opted to sit inside since it was a little cold outside.  We stood in line to order and found two spots inside.  the hard plastic hard and a ripped up old couch.  I got an hibiscus ice tea and a cookie.  I was hoping for more desserts to pick from.  The only thing good was the ice tea.  The place was so loud, it was hard to even converse with my friend.

I use to be a regular at SFS when I lived closer.  But since I am moved to East LA, I have not been to SFS in a LONG time (4 years).  My 16 niece was in town from Ohio and our mission was to hit all the stores that they do not have in Ohio so she would have clothes that no one else at her school or town.  It was fun!  We walked the entire mall in 3 hours and got a ton of stuff.  Loved the new additions and nice to see the old staples get  bigger spots.

I so wanted to like this place, but I was not a FAN! I got the combo with BBQ pork and teriyaki chicken and chicken fried rice.  The BBQ pork was not GOOD at all, chewy and tough to eat.  The teryiyaki chicken was even worse, the sauce was a clump of jello like substance.  GROSS!  The fried rice was so soggy and the beans did not go with the rest of the food.  =(  They have a friendly staff and hurdle customers in like cattle.

It is a pretty cool place.  All the hardwood furniture and windows looking outside.  The service is great!  Not the restaurant's fault, but the screaming kid (45 mins) made my head hurt!  SPINACH & ARTICHOKE FONDUE - Delicious...   CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP - Perfect to warm up the soul CRISPY HALF CHICKEN - This was so good, I would just come back for this

I have stayed here a few times and enjoyed their spa.  I love it here.  It is secluded and makes me feel like I am not in the middle in the desert.  The water area (pools, lazy river, etc.) is great for the kids.  I love this place for my stayaction!  Plus I can still meet up with my friends and everyone can come back and chilax at the bar area.

I had the chicken sandwich (pesto, lemon mayo, grilled chicken, etc. on a cibatta bun)...  One of my favies!  Second time have it.  I try to get something different all the time, but the chicken was too good not eat again.  Oh, we had our usual half sweet potato and S&P fries to kick off the Friday night.  Love u FEZ!

I love FEZ and it is killing me to give them 2 stars.  Why?  The service was just flat out awful!  Our annual Christmas meet up was not a good experience.  The food was still great as always.  We sat for 10 mins before anyone came by.  Then another 10 mins before our drinks made it to the table and we ordered.  Never saw the server again to get a refill until the food arrived.  Then we had to flag another server down for another refill.  They said they will get our server.  Maybe 5 mins or more then the our server showed up.  I am so bummed!!!!

We came on a Sunday.  This place is packed, thank goodness we got there early.  I loved the environment, food, and service.  EXCELLENT!  Eggs Benedict - Muffins, sauce, eggs, spinach, and Canadian bacon - they all blended together and melted in my mouth.  SO SO GOOD!  Roasted Potatoes - Roasted to perfection and seasoned just spot on.    Chocolate Parva - Flourless chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream.  HELLO!  Melt me, I have tasted a slice of heaven!

I went on a Friday night after work with 3 of my girlfriends.  It was raining, cold, and we were HUNGRY!  Got a good spot right across from the front door, very surprised.  The parking lot was parked with cars.  Must be our lucky night!  Found a table on the other side of the bar, where the music was blasting.  It was still all good!    We ordered:  Rosie's Chili Con Quezo Dip, Patrick's Irish Potato Skins, Jimky's Famous Chicken Wings Mild, Quigley's Quesadilla, Rosie's "World Famous" Pulled Pork Sandwich, Corned Beef & Cabbage, & Sweet Potato Fries.  And of course drinks!!!  Yes, our eyes are bigger than our stomaches.  The waitress warn us that it is ALOT of food.  The girls said the drinks were weak, but I only had ice tea.  All the food was great!  The service was wonderful.  She was very nice!    Loved the central location and the pub atmosphere!

Went on a Sunday afternoon with my brother since we were near downtown Glendale.  It is slightly hidden, but if you have Yelp you will FIND it.   =)  It is a house converted to a restaurant, so it is pretty small.    I ordered #1 Cha Gio:  Deep-fried egg rolls filled with ground pork.  Dip those yummies in the sweet fish sauce, I am gravy!  These were good, but I still preferred the "normal" size egg rolls.  Then I got #8 Pho Ga: rice noodle soup with shredded chicken.  The soup base is pretty good, plenty of noodles and cooked to the right texture, and the shredded chicken not fatty so excellent.  I also ordered the soy bean milk.    All in all I like the place and the food, but it is on the pricey side for Vietnamese food compared to other places.  Oh the service there is great.  The two servers were like basketball players.  In sync and great teamwork to make the customers happy.

Support Mom and Pop places!!!  This is a small gem in a strip mall.  We came for dinner on a Saturday and thinking 7:45pm, table for 3 should be able to get in.  Nope, this place was packed!  It was only a 15 min wait.  I got the Adam and Eve (Beef and Chicken) Kabobs with rice.  OMG...  GOOD!  Meats are juicy and the rice was cooked perfectly.  The service was good, but just did not like we were the table right next to the door.  I can touch the door from my seat.

I love LOVE Red Door Spas.  I use to go to the Biltmore area one until I discovered there is one down the street from me.  It is a hidden gem!  This location is 2 stories of magic.  With any service they invite you to enjoy the spectacular fireplaces and their   lap pool.  I was greeted as soon as I walked in the RED door.  The staff is so awesome.  It is a pretty big location, many relaxing areas, ladies only courtyard with a hot tub outside, etc!    I got the Olive Oil Salt Body Glow, Red Door Signature Massage, and Time Saver Facial for myself as a bday gift.  Love the ice tea they offer there.  Olive Oil Salt Body Glow:  WOW, my skin is scrubbed, rubbed, and soft.  And I showered the salt off in an outside shower.  It was awesome!!!  Red Door Signature Massage:  Oh my, I was in and out of consciousness.  I feel like melted butter after the massage.  Time Saver Facial:  It was a nice express facial.  Gentle exfoliation, mask, massage, & moisturizer.  Nice!

12 of us had lunch there. For a chain, it is not too bad. The meats are tender, you can pick your own sauces from the table, the cornbread is yummy!   I had the STL ribs and pork brisket served with cornbread and mac & cheese. I do not know (OK, I did not read) that the mac & cheese has jalapeno peppers. My husband was sweet and trade his fries with me... Yes, I am a wimp when it comes to anything with temperature. Everything was good... The service was good...   The food was not mouth water or jaw dropping GOOD! So 4 stars...

I enjoy shopping here.  Things to look at, things to touch, things to eat, things to try, and things I am not sure what it is for.  Nice that the prices remain low.  Yes, I had to buy a blue bag but you know what?  I love the blue bag.  So many uses!!!    Love that it is easy to exchange and/or return.

LGO - I am in love with you!  First, you wow me with breakfast (your muffins melt me).  Then your drinks and sweets.  I finally had time to try your pizza.  Why didn't I come sooner?  Boy, I was missing out.  I got the gladiator pizza.  It was very good:  thin crust, crust was tasty, cheese was so flavorful, the sausage was full of flavors too, and there was pepperoni hiding between the crust and the cheese.  The cheese pizza was great too.  My mouth and tummy was a happy camper.    Why 4 stars?  The service.  It was slow, had to ask for refills, and just painfully to get your server's attention.  The place can get a little loud!

I love the location and easy parking, but the customer service is a hit or miss here.  Some departments are awesome (shoes), but some are like a ghost town.  Today, I got great friendly customer service checking out on the 3rd floor by the undies and bra.  And they have some pretty great sales going on!

Love their pizza!!!  The make your own is cool.  My niece loved that she can create a pizza of her OWN.  We walked in and ordered... It was linner (4pm) but we were hungry after all the shopping.  My niece ordered a pepperoni and smoked ham pizza.  I got the chicken peso pizza.  We got our drinks, sat, and talked.  An employee asked if we wanted a chopped salad, they made 1 too many.  Sure, my niece inhaled it.  Her pizza came and I was told they made a mistake with mine.  Nice, so I am here watching her eat.  =(  My pizza finally came after 10 mins.

OMG!  I did not absorb all they offered there or I would have short circuited, LOL!  I went straight in for look for decorated fabric for a headboard.  My head was spinning as I was walking through picture frames, xmas things, crafts, shirts, etc.  Then finally fabric.  I need to come back on a week day night (less people) to scope out the entire place.  I can't imagine not finding anything you need for your crafty projects here.

I have been to Claim Jumper in CA.  They have been great!  The one in Avondale is just ok, I have been coming back a few times and it still has not changed my mind.  The service has been just so-so.  One time my chicken was served under cooked.  I do not know if I will return.  I still love in Claim Jumper in Deer Valley.

I have not been here in a LONG time.  I remember the burgers are YUM!  But The Frenchy sandwich on the menu was screaming "GET ME, GET ME, ORDER ME!".  But my friend saw that I was torn so she ordered the Vigazz Burger and offered to share.  So, I had 1/2 a Frenchy and 1/2 the Vigzz Burger.  WOOOOOOOOO....  Frenchy - SO GOOD!  Love the dipping sauce. Vigazz Burger - The zing from the sauce, Yum!  Cook to perfection burger. French Fries - Love those skinny fries with the seasoning.  The service was great!!!

Came here for a wedding!!  It is beautiful there.  The staff is extra friendly and super helpful.  And great with directions (the place is huge, you need directions).  They even have electric carts that drive around the ground to pick lost souls.  LOL!    The pics look fabulous!   Our friends had an outdoor wedding next to the body of water with a ball decoration that has fire and flowing water (Great back drop for pics).  We hung out at the outside area for drinks, pics, and chats after the ceremony.  Then we were led to the banquet room.  The place was very nice.  The servers were awesome.

We ordered the 24 wings (8 honey bbq, 8 lemon pepper, & 8 hot).  It is nice that they can split up the wings that way and everyone get their own flavors.  I loved my lemon pepper wings.  YUM!  I ordered and shared a flatbread pizza:  Garlic parm chicken.  Right on!!!    The served was ok.  We had to ask for refills.

This place is has almost everything you need for an outdoor adventure under 1 roof.  Normally not my kind of store, but it is my hubby's.  I can NOT and do NOT hunter, fish, or camp.  My outside activities are more like sitting on the beach.  =)  Anyway the hubby was looking for boots, so I tagged along.  The shoe department is upstairs.  I found comfy flip flops... =)  Love them... but I already have 6 of those kinds so I had to put them back.  But I know were they live.  Until next time!!!    Next to the shoe department was this fudge store-ish place.  YUM!  They have all sort of goodies in it.  I walked out with 6 different kinds of fudge.  =) I am a happy camper now.  They have some dogs stuff too... WOW!    So it is not too bad of a store.  I found stuff for me and the doggies.  =)

We went here for one of our monthly lunch places.  Plenty of parking in the lots or on the streets.  We sat in on the patio.  It was nice weather and great service.  I ordered the chicken quesada (red peppers, chicken, bacon, & cheese).  It was huge.   1/2 of the order was good enough for me.  Good lunch!  YUM!

My hubby selected Feeney's for my bday dinner because I have been dying to try a Beef Wellington after watching Hell's Kitchen for years.  Pastry and beef, hello!!!    This place is one of those old school restaurants, tables, and feel.  I remember these places when I was a kid.  We were greeted right away and she turned out to be our server too.  Maria was awesome and her support staff.  Our drinks were never empty and they came to check on us multiple times but not to the point that they are standing over us.    We ordered: Chicken Wings with Ranch - Those little things are spicy but so crispy.  The ranch helped to cut some of the spicy.  Cream of Broccoli Soup - Thick, creamy, and good.  Beef Wellington - OMG, it was good.  It was so good, I could not stop eating.  The mash potato and gravy was a great side to go with my wellington.    Lamp Chops - My hubby loved it!  He said we are coming back!!!  They bread that came with the meal was so good!!!  I ate both pieces of the rye.  My husband had the pumpernickel.  The server found out we were there to celebrate my bday, so she bought me a huge slice of mud pie (ice cream).  It was so good and they sang happy birthday to me.  Too bad, I was only available to have a few bites.  I was so full from the wellington, but happy bday to my hubby, he inhaled MY mud pie.  =)

Came here with my god-daughter to celebrate her 18th birthday.  We had a great time and it was perfect.  I ordered the New York Strip and their mash potatoes.  Cooked to perfection....  Roast Prime Rib with asparagus.  She inhaled the whole prime rib and all the veggies.  WOW, I think she loved it?  LOL!  We had White Chocolate Brownie for dessert:  A Warm Blonde Brownie, Freshly Baked with Callebaut Chocolate and Topped with French Vanilla Ice Cream, Warm Chocolate Sauce and Whipped Cream.  It was so good!  The service was outstanding.

Hike #4 for 2010 was North Mountain Park.  Got there around 10:30am on a Sunday.  Sunny and wonderful weather!  We got a parking near Trail #44.  We hiked up trail #44, it was strenuous but we needed a little more so we went down the pavement and off to this little trail that led us to trail #101.  Cool!  It was a little declines/inclines and between two mountains.  The scenary was goregous!  We walked until we hit trail #100 and we took a left.  Walked and walked..  Watched people walk their dogs & people riding horses.  Neat!  We got to where the trail ended.  Hum?  Went off to trail #60 then.  Another strenuous hike and it was a circle.  Circled back to trail #100 and we back tracked all the way back.  3-1/2 hours later we were back at the car.    Man, my calves are SORE today!

I have been eating here for the last few years.  Nothing much has changed.  The nice wood furniture, friendly staff, and good food.    I went to lunch with my brother.  We shared a combo meal (bulgogi and assorted tofu soup).  I added a gyoza for appetizer.  Of course, we noticed a sign order 1 appetizer and get the 2nd 50% off.  DOH!     Gyoza - Fried with noodles, veggies, etc. inside - EXCELLENT Bulgogi - YUM, needs a little more sauce but still YUM Assorted tofu soup - Had seafood, meat, tofu, and a spicy soup (too spicy for me to even try - Medium)  I have had the lunch specials too... Can't beat the price with all the items you get.

It smells delish in there... I wanted everything in sight!  EVERYTHING!  So I got:  Cookies:  Milk chocolate chip, snickerdoodle, & dark chocolate walnut.  OMG!!!  They were so good.  I inhaled them in yes, one sitting.  Man, the sugar rush was worth it.    Cupcakes:  Chocolate, Classic, birthday cupcake, and orange blossom.  Ok, this took 2 sittings to inhale.  The butter cream was so good and a LOT of it.  The cupcake were moist and melt in your mouth.  Absolute awesome.   I need to return to try the bars, breads, and baked donuts.  SUGAR HIGH I can't wait!

I have been to this location in awhile, but my coworker from IN was in town.  She wanted something healthy, so Pita Jungle popped in my mind.  She absolutely loved it.  She commented on how trendy the place is.  She loved the pasta salad and the portion is huge.  I ordered the humus and grilled chicken with roasted pinenuts.  OMG, this is my favie now.  Move over chicken philly steak, Hello my new friend humus with grilled chicken with roasted pinenuts.  The pita was plenty.   Mmmmmmm..................

I have not been to this park since I was a teen.  It has changed a lot.  It is cleaner and updated.  We came here for a celebration of life.  It was a nice set up.  They brought a lot of chairs and tables.  They have a LOT of family.  Plenty of food.  Of course you can't blame mother nature for the bees.  They love sweets.  It was nice we were close to the play area to watch the kids.

I am only reviewing the Dim Sum.  Went there on a Saturday afternoon and man o man, it is packed to the gills!  Thank goodness we made a reservation for 18 and requested to seat in the main dinning room.    The dim sum carts were flying all over the aisles.  Some carts will stop by to ask what you like and some fly by without getting you a chance to see what is available.  We had so many dishes, so I will only comments on the ones that I remember.  Pros: Lai Bak Go (Taro Fried Cakes) - Warm, perfected fried on both sides, and tasty Shu Mai (Dumplings) - Pretty large sizes, good taste, and warm Char Sui Bao (Steamed BBQ Pork Buns) - BBQ was flavorful and steamed perfectly Pork and Preserved Egg Rice Soup - OMG, good!!! Gar Lear (Fried Bread wrapped with flat rice noodles) - Crispy bread, soft noodles, and mixed with the perfect soy sauce mixture  Con: Black bean with spare ribs - flavorless and oily White Snow Buns - Deflated and undone  I need to come back!!!

I heart Coffee Bean!  Loved you in Vegas, loved you in LA, and now loving you in AZ.  I normally drool over the ice blended stuff but I wanted to try the teas since my friend said they have a great selection.  My god-daughter was undecided.  The girl behind the counter let her taste a few samples.  That was cool!  I got the tropical ice tea.  She got the green tea apricot something.

It has been about 6 years since we moved into this house.  We painted the interior about 3 years ago.  Time to touch up the trim, doors, etc.  My home builder said they used Dunn-Edwards paint and the color.  I found this one close to my home, COOL!    They are the nicest staff!  The acknowledge when you walk in.  I was not sure about the amount of paint, they listen and suggested a size.  I showed them a discount card but it was an OLD one so they replaced my card with the new one.  And less than 15 or 20 mins, out with my custom paint.  When they hand over the paint, they double check to make sure that is want you ordered.

Had to go get the Grill Cheese Burger after seeing all the commercials and ruining my diet!!!  Darn commercials.  These honestly looks better on TV and I imagined it tasting better.  It was basically I bacon cheese burger with extra cheese.  The cheeses were not thoroughly melted enough for me.  I should have still home with a grill cheese sandwich.  The employees were very very friendly!

We came here for Mother's day at noon.  The place was not busy at all.  I have never been to Verrado before... OMG, it is like the set of a Weeds or Desperate Housewives.  Everything is perfect:  lawns, trees, houses, kids, etc.    The place is on main street and easy to find (on the corner).  Cute modern decorations with indoor and outdoor seating.    We ordered:  Platto Misto - Assortment of cured italian meats and cheese served with olives and breadsticks:  All the meats and breadsticks were good.  The cheese was a little hard and dry.    Complimenti alla Mamma Pizza - Mozzerella, Ricotta, Ham, Salame, Parmigano Reggiano & tomato sauce:  YUMMY, love the thin crust.  Clinque Formaggi (5 cheeses) Pizza - Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Provolone, Ricotta, Parmigano Reggiano:  This was my favorite, so good.  Excellent!!!  Americana Pizza - Mozzarella, Pepperoni, Parmigano Reggiano, and tomato sauce:  It was good, but a little greasy.  All the pizzas are thin crust and oven baked (like Sauce).  The service was OK.  When our cups when empty the server had to ask if we liked refills (you can clearly see with all the pizzas on the table that we were still eating), so yes refills on drink would be nice.

I never knew this place exisited until someone in our lunch group mentioned it.  We went over after lunch.  It was nice to see used items recycled.  They have a lot of stuff (video games, books, music, magazines, etc.)  They had live music and she was GOOD.  They also have a little cafe (looks yummy).

Only reviewing their CT Scan and medical records processes.  They call you for your appointment for CT Scan.  Get there 15 prior, so you can check in downstairs.  Then go upstairs to check in to be in queue.  Then they will call when you are up (could be from 20 min to 1-1/2 hours) wait.  But the CT Scan is just less than 5 mins.    The medical records request is downstairs and tell her what you are looking for.  She can take care of just records and paperwork, but if you need CD then she will give you information on what do to next.

My friend got the time-share suite (2 bedrooms, living room, kitchen, and 2 balaconys).  SWEET!  We had a wonderful time enoying complex.  The grounds were well kept.    The pool area was walking distance.  2 large pools (1 pool had a waterfall, volleyball, and basketball), 2 hot tub areas, 1 kiddie pool.    Stayaction for the weekend!

I have been to a few kid bouncy parties before and some of them the other Pump It Up locations.  The place is clean, neat, but a little warm.  The staff is very nice.  This location is a little different.  They had 3 rooms.  Room #1 - 3 bouncy:  small slide, basketball, and obstacle course.  We were in there for 30 to 40 mins.  Then Room #2 - 3 bouncy again:  Huge slide, mini obstacle, and boxing ring.  Again, another 30 to 40 mins.  Room #3 - Cake and pizza room.   All the kids had fun but they were sweaty.  But room #3 they turn down the AC so it was cool after 15 mins.

It was ok, we will mostly likely not go again.   We placed an order for take out. Pork Foo Young and Sesame Chicken. The egg in the foo young was very dry and the sauce was kinda of tasteless. The Sesame Chicken was the usual fried chicken in honey sauce, it was ok. The rice was moist and hot.

I was not sure if it was a chocolate store or a sit down place.  A little confused.  But I was greeted right away by two lovely ladies and they explained to me they are a chocolate store and in the back they have a cafe.  OH!   They had pre-packaged chocolates on the right hand side of the store and then on the left hand was a la carte hand cut chocolates you can buy in each.  I got dark chocolate covered pretzels....  The dark chocolate had this slightly bitter and sweet taste.  It was so so good.  Then I got a bunch of other dark chocolate covered each thingy from the case.  I have to say....  It is not super sweet chocolate that you eat one and you go into a sugar coma.  It is just a perfect balance...  I need to come back to the cafe.  I heard the cakes are to DIE for.

I love this place.  I go to Lisa Olsen for my haircuts.  She is awesome.  I have been with Lisa for over 2 years now.  I go in and show her few pictures of what I like.  She cuts my hair in her style that will work with my facial structure.  Love LISA!

We always order pizza from here.  It was the local pizza joint.  We loved the pizza and wings.  But something change on our last order.  We ordered the pizza for a UFC party at our house.  The pizzas were burnt.  We got the wrong pizza.  I am not sure if it was a one off mistake but they should have checked the bottom of the pizza for a QC check.  I could not believe it was black.  We did not know until someone told us about the burnt pizza.  It was too late to return, since everyone has already got slices and the fight was on.  =(   Maybe I will try it again when it is just us and hope it was a one off mistake.

I ordered from #1 Brother's to try it again.  They are back on their game.  The pizza was hot, cheese was melty, and it is just plain good.  So happy the last time was just an one off mistake.  Thank goodness.  My husband was about to ban us from this place.    Love the think pizza and crust.

WOW, WOW!  The pizza is great, the wings are yum, and the cheese sticks are goodness.  I like the pizza because of the thin crust, melting cheese, and great taste.   Even when I get the pizza home, it is still HOT!    Support a local business!!  The staff is extra friendly!

I had a seat in the box area on the first floor on the left side.  It was very awesome seats.  It was very hot outside but it is not to walk in and the AC is blasting to cool off.  I took the light rail downtown instead of fighting parking.  The light rail dropped us off very close by and it is a light walk to the Symphony Hall.  Plenty of windows for picking up tickets.  Friendly staff to guide you on where to go.  The performance for the Earth HD show was very good.  Loved they had some visuals to go with some of the pieces.  Very very cool!

Was here on a Saturday afternoon.  WOW, the place was popping!!!  It is bright, colorful, and clean.  The menu is on the wall.  There are so many things on it.  I settled with a Thai Iced Tea Slush + boba.  The bobas were soft and a good texture.  I am interested to try the other items on the menu.

This location is the same like all the others.  Ordering station, tables, games section, and prizes.  Some kids I use to babysit are all teenagers now, they wanted to re-live their PPP days.  We met up there to catch up!  It was easy to find, huge parking lot, the place was not packed to the gills with kiddie birthday parties (sat afternoon), and it was clean!  The pizza tasted better than I remembered.  The wings were ok.  They had a great everyday deals on the menu.  We got the 2 large & 20 wings.  I had a great time getting caught with everyone's lifes and sharing memories.

I met my brother for lunch, since I was working near his work hood.  This place is bright, clean and modern.  We were quickly greeted by the host.  As soon as we sat, we were greeted by the server.  Got our drink quick and took our order.  I ordered the Meaty Italian pizza.  OMG, the crust was thin and crispy.  Really good.  Very GOOD.  I likey!  My brother woofed down his spaghetti and meatballs.    Great food and service, whats not to like?

We were there today for lunch and WOW!  The food and service was terrific.  I ordered our usual:  Crispy chicken burger with swiss.  My husband ordered the Guac Burger.  We spotted a new item:  pretzel bites with dipping sauce.  WOW, yummy!  The server, Jerri was AWESOME.  She was friendly and super attentive.  Finally someone in the service industry happy to serve.    They had some issues with our GCs, we told the server just take the complete $35 in GCs and not to worry about it.  The Manager gave us the 2 bonus $5 GCs back and said it was our lucky day.  We would have gotten like $1.50 back or something.  That was very kind of them.  =)

They really try their best to do whatever they can for you.  But if do you have to having procedure or treatment for illness, don't go anywhere else.  I have been going to a different place for 1 year and I am just getting worse.  I am hoping Mayo and their staff can have a better treatment plan for me.  The entire staff is so friendly and helpful.

I was admitted to the ER again at the end of April.  It was so nice to know the staff is on the ball to monitor, read my file, etc.  My blood pressure was dropping like it is HOT.  I was getting dizzy, clammy, and very sick.  They tested and checked me head to toe.  Unfortunately, I was kept for a few days to be observed, more testing, and get to the bottom of what caused all my issues.  I had an internal specialist, infections disease, and radiologist teams working on my case.  I am continuously in awe of the teams here and saving my butt!  I am still on their treatment plan and really hoping to recovery 100% this year.

We came to this place to watch the mini-horse competition (They have an indoor area).  This place is about 10 min drive from the strip right off the I215.  It was easy to find and TONS of free parking.  Sweet!    They have a large casino floor and it is an open lay out.  They have a few restaurants:  Buffet, Cafe, Restaurant (nicer), hot dog vendor ($0.75), Deli, and a steak n shake.  Movie theaters and bowling alley.  Things here are very cheap compared to the strip.

M and I drop in for dinner on a weekday.  The location of this place was a little tricky, but once you find it the food is good.  The place is small, so get there early if not be prepared to wait for a table.  I ordered the gyoza (Japanese Pan steamed dumplings), I was pretty good.  For my entrée, I ordered the Hana Katsu (Golden breaded chicken breast infused with Koso butter).  Wow, it was good...  Lightly breaded, fried just right, chicken was juicy, and Koso butter was a good touch of flavor.  For my dessert, I got the cream filled tempura (cream lightly battered to a golden crunch).  It was done just perfect.  The service was pretty good, she double check our orders maybe due to a language barrier, but either way our order came out perfect.

This is our 3rd time at this NextCare.  First time, it was a LONG long wait.  Second time, I looked online they have this new service:  check in online and wait at home.  They will call you when your appt is time.  You walk in sign paperwork and within 5 mins or less you are called.  Seriously, everything done in less than 20 to 30 mins.  So the 3rd time, we checked in online at 6pm.  We got a call at 6:20pm and they asked if we can be there in 20 mins.  We got there, signed in, and less than 5 mins we were called.  In and out in less than 30 mins this time (they had to perform a super minor surgery on my hubby.

We had a party of 13 on a Friday night.  Happy Birthday, G!  Some of us has had Indian food and the other half was in for an adventure!  Got there in time for happy hour.  I ordered the spicy chicken wings mild.  My mouth was on FIRE!  Too spicy for me..  But they were good.  The garilc nan was so GOOOOOD.  I got the Chicken Tandoori wrap...  YUM!!!  They made it with less spicy for me (Yes, I am a whimp).  In the middle of dinner, the music got louder... We were not sure what is going on but then out of no where there was a belly dancer.  She is shaking and moving all over the resturant.  The kids loved it.  They went out to dance with the belly dancer.  So of our adults too!!  It was a fun filled events and the food was good.

My husband loves Indian food, so we stopped by for lunch since we were on Bell Road already. I had to order the Chicken Tandoori wrap again. It was good and the naan was just fluffy enough... My husband ordered the daily special (Beef Stew, Garlic Naan - extra $, and comes with rice). The daily special was AWESOME! We had great service and the waiter was good to look at too. Great food, good scenery, I am one happy woman!

The location is tucked in a corner in the plaza.  We almost missed it.  It is this little cute place and dishes up awesome desserts and food.    I had the Sausage and Egg Sandwich (Sausage, cheddar cheese and mayo.  Served on a English muffin with baked eggs).  The muffin was so soft it was GOOD.  The flavors all just worked together to make my mouth happy.    We ordered a plan cheesecake for my mom's 60th bday.  We will get to dive into that tonight.

The first time I tried Sprinkles was in Los Angeles. It was crazy. The line was out the door (20 mins waiting time). I was telling Deb that for food that makes me wait it better be GOOD! LOL! Finally, we were inside I was very intoxicated by the smells and actually placing my eyes on the cupcakes. Got 4 of them: red velvet, back and white, vanilla milk chocolate, and coconut (I think). SO GOOD...   I have been to the Scottsdale location several times and love that fact that I am not waiting 20 mins outside. Every time has been less than 10 mins... In and out with my sweets... Too bad, not in my hood but I whenever I am in Scottsdale... Hello Sprinkles...

Had to drag my niece from Ohio to my fave cupcake place.  She normally does not like frosting, but she inhaled the frost off the cupcake at Sprinkles.  LOL!  She loved the milk chocolate one.  We got 6 (all chocolate) for us.  We shared the other 4 with her brother, grandma, and uncle.  My nephew loved it so much, he inhaled a second one.  Chocolate marshmallow - new flavor for me - OMG, hello happiness!

We had a reservation for 18, but our other 7 friends wimped out at the last min.  The 11 of us enjoyed Switch.  We had the high table by the bar and kitchen.  Tim was our server and he was awesome!!!  The weekend brunch menu looks so yummy.  I ordered the Breakfast Gallette (large puffy pasty topped 2 eggs, sausage, jack cheese & cheddar cheese, & served with breakfast potatoes. Everything tasted so so good, one minor thing I did not know the eggs were over easy.     The rest of the group polished off their food too!  Some of us ordered off the regular menu.  OMG, the burger looks and smells delicious!  I so need to be back to order another things off the regular menu!!!!

My brother and I went on a Saturday afternoon.  WOW, it is filled with people everywhere.  We thought boy the wait is going to be long.  They had two spots on the end of the counter and asked if the counter was ok?  Why not?  We want to sit and watch the action!!!    They had 10+ people working the tables (serving, cleaning, etc.).  They are flying everywhere to get customers drinks and food as SUPER speeds.  Everyone seem to know what to do and everyone is helping each other.  So sum up the service, it is GREAT.  Someone is there to help you anytime.    I order the HUNGRY MAN breakfast:  3 scrambled eggs, 2 sauage links, 3 slices of sourdough, and a mountain of hash browns.  It was so much food, no way I can finish.  The scrambled eggs were real eggs (not that powder crap mix)!  Everything was good.  The toasted sourdough was so GOOD.  Maybe it was all that butter they put on.    I also ordered 1 waffle:  HUM, YUM, HUM GOOD.    My brother HAD to order the cinannon bun:  it was a little hard.  You want a hearty breakfast, you need to come try "The Place"!

It was a blast!  80s music vidoes showing, food is flowing, and people are bowling.  FUN!  Clean, great service, and decent food for a bowling alley.    After bowling we headed to the game room.

Almost flavorless.  I so wanted to LOVE this place but the food was just not that good.  The staff was nice!

Love the vibe and look of the place.  Seats all around the place (inside and outside).  The coffee smells were so good!!!  We came here for treats after dinner.  We were greeted by the guy working in the behind the counter.  He told us to grab a seat and a waiter will be with us.  Cool!    We sat for about 5 to 7 mins before someone came by.  We noticed some of the tables were a little dirty and an employee cleaned the table by wiping with his sleeves.  We finally got our orders in and the drinks and gelatos came out slow.  Only 3 of us had our stuff with the other 2 staring at us.  The homemade gelato was great.  Everyone said the drinks were good.    Service is slow, place needs to tidy up, & the restrooms were pretty dirty too.

Had a great HH time!  We were sat in the bar area in the high tables.  The tables are round and small, we were all foodies so we worried if the food would all fit.  Who cares!  We ordered 2 to 3 small plates each (4 of us) and drinks.  It was a great deal and we had fun!  Duck triangles, fires and gravy, korean bbq taco, cheese and spinach dip, sliders (DA BOMB), mac & cheese, etc.  I can't remember, we put a good dent in the food.  The server was pretty attentive but we did have to refills on drinks a few times.    The high tables were great, but since I was short my legs were dangling the whole time and they feel asleep.  So if we would have sit in a regular table, I think that would have been 5 stars.

After a long day (10 hours of test/scans) at the Mayo in Fountain Hills, I felt like pancakes so Yelped it.  You expect the food from the IHops to taste somewhat the same.  My sampler was good, but the pancake was not.  I was not sure what it was??  Batter is old?  My parents mentioned the same thing that their pancakes were not very good either.  So, I am not crazy yet.  The service was slow.

This is the 4th time I have been there and it was the best experience this time.  The service was outstanding.  The waiter kept checking on us and refills came without asking (even after the bill was paid).  I ordered the naked fish selection: blacken costa rica mahi with dirty rice.  WOW, it was very tasty and delicious!  I ordered my fish well, the normally serve it medium.  I was so full, I did not make it to dessert.  The other ladies were impressed too.  One had the cedar planked salmon and the other had a greek salad.  No complaints from us...

We had a group of 12 of us on a Saturday night.  We told them it was a farewell party.  They arranged so we were all seating together in the back of the place behind the bar.  It was perfect for us to chat, get pics, and share food up and down the long tables they lined up for us.    I think we ordered almost everything off the menu (appetizers, drinks, sides, sushi, rice, main dishes, desserts, etc).  Everything I tasted was FABULOUS!    I will be suggestion this place to my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary.

The wings are great so we like to order them when we eat there or for pick up.  This time we ordered 48 wings and pizza for pick up.  When we got the food home and we found out we were shorted 12 wings.  WTF!!!  You think paying over $50 for our order they would double check your order, right?

My yelp review for the missing dozen wings got the Manager's attention back in December 20, 2012, so I thought I would write an update.  Message from the Manager:  I have put you in my manager log for a dozen wings on us.  Please let us know immediately if there is ever a problem and we will happily correct it. If you wouldn't mind updating your yelp review stating that this has been resolved, we would greatly appreciate it.  That is nice that they really read the reviews.  I just have not had time to go back since December.  Thanks for reaching out to your customers.

I have not been to this mall in AGES!  It has changed and has a facelift (nice).  They have a parking structure, Costco, etc....    We walked through the food court area.  Nice, clean, and lots of tables/chairs to sit.  In the mall, they have many rest areas so your feet can get a break.  =)  I am not sure if they let dogs in, but someone was walking a HUGE dog???

L.W. and I stopped here for a quick HH bite before a Yelp Shop Local event.  We were greeted immediately and seated in the back.  It was nice!  Our server came to greet us quickly and took our drink orders.  The drinks came quick and we placed our food order of many appetizers.    Catfish Beignets - They are catfish crusted with cornmeal and fried crisp served with jalapeno tartar sauce.  WOW, these little fried strips of heaven were so so SO GOOD!    Smoked Chicken Quesadilla - Grilled chicken with onions and green peppers, cheese, and salsa stuff.   I am not sure what but both L and I thought it was ah, ok.    Green Chile Shredded Pork Nachos - OMG... These are SO SO good.    Only minor con:  The server had to be reminded to refills our drinks.

Sunday brunch is BUSY!  We waited 25 mins for a table for 5.  This is the new location.  The place is packed and LOUD inside.  We were seated in the back.    The table was a little sticky and the laminated menus were wet.  Our server greeted us immediately and took our drink orders.  The menu is simple and short, love it.  But I am with indecisive people.  The server had to come back twice before everyone decided on what to order.    I ordered the The Crying Pig omelet (Bacon, Sausage & Swiss cheese) and hash browns.  The omelet was a little over done on the edges but perfect in the middle.  The hash browns were good and greasy!  I ordered a 1/2 order of the french toast to share with other person.  The 1/2 piece I got tasted kind of burnt but the part that was not tasted great.    I am with Michael F. on this place 3 for the food and 4 for the service.  Overall 3.5 stars.

Love their Kitchen and Food, Bed & Bath, & Decorating & Accessories items, ok maybe everything they offer.  I love my redish with black accents dinner set.  Had to get all the serving dishes too.  Love the stainless steel pots, I need to get another one soon.  And the cast iron dutchoven.  Love my Marimekko bath towels (blue/green circles).  Their reversible green bath towels are my favorite.  Wish my backyard is done soon, so I can add patio furniture.  Yes, the prices are a bit high but just love their stuff.

I checked Yelp and saw all the stars!!  I need to try this place and it was by Ikea.  Plus!!  I got the chicken & my hubby got the steak.  The place smells delicious.  I got the cheese fries.  They have a simple menu, I like it!    Ordered and I was expecting greatness.  I was so bummer to taste chicken and cheese.  No flavor (salt and/or black pepper)?  My hubby's steak was tasteless too.  The fries were good, but eat the cheese quick.  When it get cold, it does not taste good.

We were here to watch the football game with some friends.  They have happy hour drink specials even on a Saturday until 7pm, sweet!  $3 Domestic and Mexican Beers $5 Margaritas Discounted Appetizers  Seth, our server was great.  Always checked in with us.  Made sure our drinks were always full.    Salsa was a little weak (no kick) and chips were good.  Got the chimi dinner in enchilada style with shredded pork, just one word WOW.  Love the minor kick of hot (I am a WIMP, so to others it is probably nothing).  The shredded pork was real good.  Everyone ate their food happily, then after drinking for a couple of hours the munchies started.  We ordered the salt and pepper wings & habanero wings.  S&P wings were DAMN good.  Fried to gold perfection and the right mixture of salt and pepper on them.  Habanero wings kicks you in the lip, mouth, tongue, and fights you all the down the hatch.  If you like hot, then habanero wings are for you.    We ordered the kings brownie explosion to top off the evening.  The warm brownies were SO GOOD.  The ice cream and whipped cream just added to the wonderfulness.

Went back to Loco Patron last night.  My husband had to have the Salt and Pepper Wings!  Even though it is a 42 mile one way trip to the place.  For a Wednesday night, they had a lot of things going.  The hockey and basketball games were on TV and Wednesday nights is their poker tournament events.  There was a steady flow of people for the time we were there.  Even with all the activities our service was still GREAT!  Seth ROCKS!  Ok down to the good stuff - FOOD review:  Salt and Pepper Wings served with carrots, celery and chipotle ranch dressing - The wings were fried to a golden perfection.  The wings were cooked through & through but still juicy and full of the simple balance of salt and pepper.  Baked Mac & Cheese with grilled chicken breast - Spiral macaroni cheesed out with a creamy comb of smoked provolone and cheddar jack.  It is topped with toasted bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  The grilled chicken was still juicy not dry.  The combination of the cheese and the toasted bread crumbs was so cheesy and GOOD.  Hubby had the loco soft tacos with the shredded pork and told me that they tacos were just RE-DONK-U-LIOUS.  I am not sure if that is a word but OK we will go with that.  Next time I need to save room for dessert.  The Sopapilla and ice cream has been calling my name.

I am only reviewing for the drinks and atmosphere on Saturday night. We made it there after dinner at ACE. We were out in the patio area. It was a little warm, but not too bad. Got a table facing the huge glowing TV out in the common area of Tempe Marketplace. I think you can probably tan from this. LOL!   Getting drinks were OK wait. No one came by to clear the table off (drinks from the last group). Drinks were good, price was OK. All of a sudden the music got loud and some waitresses jumped on the bar tops and started to dance and give away shirts, plastics lays, and straw hats. It was OK. The crowd was a mix of 20 to 40 somethings...   Nothing special!

OK.  This place is where everyone on the East valley get their nails did!  It is sparkly, clean, and like a day club (the music, atomsphere, the nail bar, etc).  We had reserved 6 people for a baby shower...  Baby shower pedicure!!!  Sweetness.  We all got the Pink Polish Pedicure.  You get a choice of scrub.  I got a orange scrub.  The scrub and lotion came on this dishes (like a sushi dish).  The lady kept trying to up sale for this and that.  I said no once, so just please stop asking.    My legs felt so SO soft and smooth.  I loved the color and shiney polish.

This place is huge and contain all the wines you can think of.  My husband and I actually went to look for imported beer and specialty sodas.  He found most of the imports he likes.  One of the employees actually split a bottle from 6 pack so my husband and do the create your own 6 pack deal.  Very friend and knowledge employees.  Small selection on the specialty sodas, but I know I was in a wine place.

We have been here a few times.  It is alright.  We are happy to see Japanese food so close to us, but after a few times we have not been back.  The sushi is hit and miss.  The service is terrible.  We had to keep asking for refills.  The tempanyaki grill is fun but pricing.  For that amount I rather drive further for better food and service.

I get my Asian fix when I go to Lee Lee on the west side! I get all the things I need to cook Asian dishes at home. I love that I can find all types of Asian staples so I do not have to go to store to store.

This is our annual park for Megan's birthday party!!  It is a clean and nice park with a pond with ducks, play area for kids, benches for lovey dovey couples to sit and watch the waters, etc.  Parking here is a little hard, but it is a good thing that is streets are extra wide so you can park on the sides of the street.

This is my 2nd time to this AMC.  I like it!  It is huge and clean.  The wait for tickets were quick and they have it set up that it is a hotel check in.  Not behind a bullet proof pawn shop set up.  LOL!  The concession area was huge with mutliple lines open.  Not much of a wait either.    Walked into theater #10, not too shabby.  Pretty big screen and clean seats.  The speakers sounded great.  I had a great time.

I stopped by to grab lunch before I went to visit my hubby in the hospital.  The parking is crazy!  That plaza is jam packed.  Got to the store, the tables are dirty, people are everywhere, and the employee was ready to take my order.  I just stepped in the place and I have not been there in a LONG time.  I ordered the turkey swiss bagel for lunch quickly. The sandwich was ok.  I think I will stick with bagel with cream cheese.

We were there for drinks and hanging out. There is a $5 cover charge for men. Got there noticed 3 different bar stations, 1 dance floor, 1 bull ride area, and outside patio. The music was a weird mix (hip hop, pop, rock n roll, with a mix of country). It is OK. The crowd was a mix of 20 to 30s, and drop in a few 40s+. Drinks were expensive!

It was a nice place, great food, and fun times with friends.  I got the teriyaki chicken and gyoza.  The gyoza was very good.  The teriyaki sauce was too sweet for me.  The servers are good but had to wave them down a few times for refills.

I was trying to get here before happy hour ended, I made it with 20 mins to spare!  WHOOO!  I ordered chicken yakatori!  YUM!  SO SO SO good.  Flavorful and not too sweet.  Awesome way to kick off the meal.  L was already there and got rolls and chicken wings.  I did not have any rolls but I had an Asian chicken wing.  YUM!  I ordered a Curry Katsu Pork.  Hello curry GODs.  Perfection!!!  The taste of the curry was outstanding!  Why the 4 stars?  Service was slow and lacking.

Went to this Jason's Deli with my parents.  It is set up the same as off the other ones.  Good food, good service, and you can't forgo the soft serve ice cream....    It was very nice of them to split a regular sized order of French beef for my parents.  I got the half soup/half sandwich.  My favorite:  chicken pot pie soup and corn beef sandwich.

They are opened at 11am so we decided to get there at 11:30am.  They were not opened yet.  M spoke to an employee and they said they have been waiting for someone to open the place since 10am.  I did not want to wait because I needed to return to work.  We decided to walk down to try Rice Paper.  I guess next time we will call to make sure they are open first.

Thunderbird was our second hiking outing for 2010.  Kerry said this hike for me, since I need something easy.  She can make it to the top in 23 mins.  It took me 1 hour (working on getting in shape).  We got there around 10:15am.  Parking space was still plenty and it is free.  Super nice!!    The trail was gravel and loose rocks.  I should have worn better gripping shoes then regular running shoes.  I finally got to the top of one of the mountains and the view was beautiful.  It overlooked an Arrowhead subdivision, awesome view of the west valley.  You can see the UofP stadium!  There were a lot of people but everyone was very nice and knows the courtesy of hiking routines.    I will need to get myself in better shape to run it next time!!

I was here on a Friday night pick up something for dinner and stock up on my Asian stuff.  It was hot in the store.  NO AC?  What the heck?  I found the noodles, tofu, etc. When I got home I was going to make fried tofu with beef.  I was so freaked when the package had mole all over it.  EKKKK.....

SO SO SO SO SO SO SO GOOD!  AWESOME!  We came here with all the great review.  We got bread (complimentary).  I got the meatball soup (best I have every had).  The gnocchi with vodka sauce was fantastic, gnocchi was cooked to perfection.  The pizza was just plain freaking awesome.  Thin crust, not soggy!!  One of the best pizza I have ever had.  And then the tiramisu was perfect (not too sweet) and the cake was moist and not mushy.  The service was great too.  Caution, this place is buried in the end of the little shopping center (rough area), but it is worth it for GREAT food.

The food is good there. We ordered a ton of food like usual:   wonton noodle soup - wontons were perfectly firm not too soft, noodles were the Chinese version of al dente, and a good soup base.   bbq pork noodle soup - the bbq pork was pretty good, the noodles and soup base is the same as above.   beef stew noodle soup - the flavor of the beef stew was disappointing not enough of the earthy flavor you expect to get, the noodles and soup base is the the same as above.   the peking spare ribs; roast duck and roast pork - the flavors was right on! reminded me of Hong Kong.   The only thing against this place is that is in in Lee Lee. The smells of the seafood is not too pleasant and the flies drove me nuts.

The same old selections from any piano bar.  A little so loud you can hear the waitress or your friend sitting next to you.  The waitress is either not interested in being there or just hates the human race.  You pick!  Had 1 drink and left.

We came here with 35+ of our other friends to celebrate a birthday.  We made a reservation and we were giving an area near the bar.  Since we had little kids and celebration a 17th bday, we requested to be moved to the outside.  They heated up the patio and moved tables around for us.  It was nice that the servers lined up tables inside on the window so our food will keep warm.  The 2 servers did a wonderful job keeping our drinks filled and checking on us.  The pizza and wings were good!!!  It was fun, food was good, and service was nice.

I have been the original Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge & the location in NYC and I have to say...  Eating at the Peoria location brings me back to my NY trips!  Of course, without the heavy winter coat, shaking in the cold, and wind in my face while waiting for 45 mins for a table for two.  I am here in AZ, in flipflops and enjoying the weather while waiting outside on the bench!  :)    The service was great (no asking for refills).  He checked on us a few times.  I had the white pizza with chicken and bacon...  YUM!  I am still in love with the regular red sauce.  Guess I need to go back soon!

We have dinned at the Scottsdale Fleming, it was excellent service and outstanding food.  I was so dissapointed that this Glendale location does not measure up!  The decor and atompshere is there but just not the same.  Looks like it, doesn't feel like it.  We were greeted immedately and seated as our reserved table for 6 (Saturday night - before Mother's day).  The wine list was fancy (electronic tablet).    Our server was just NOT attentive at ALL and made the experience basically SUCK. -She never mentioned the specials for the day (the list on laying on the table, someone discovered it later) -She brought the wrong beverage -She has to come back to ask was we ordered because she couldn't read her handwriting -Never was around to grab her attention  Now to the food, two of our group stressed that they needed they meats cooked well done.  One of the filet mignons was to be butterflied to make sure it is well done and the other sliced filet migon was to be well done.  Well, the ladies got their filets and they are still oozing blood.  Come on a butterflied filet migon and a SLICED filet migon not well done?  Really???  Especially on the sliced one, when you slice it and see blood and pink = NOT well done.  We had to send the 2 plates back.  The guest of honor had to sit was watch some of start to eat.  Don't get me wrong, my steak was perfect and tasted great.  You are a steakhouse, getting steaks cooked to the right temperature is your forte!    I am surprised that a Manager was not send out to appoloize or at least talk to the table when we had to send back 2 of the 6 main entrees.  He came by at the end to do a quick hello and how was everything...  Well, it sucked but nothing you can do now at this point!

L dragged me to try yoga at Urban Yoga this week.  We took Urban Flow on Monday and Urban Zen on Wednesday.  LOVED IT!  This is my first experience to try yoga outside of LA Fitness.  It is top notch here.  Urban Flow was hard but it push me to go a little more, but since it was my first class with them.  The instructor came by quite a bit to modify the moves for me.  L and I was sore so we came back on Wed for the Urban Zen, it was a nice change from the Flow class.  I love you can read the description and sign up for class online.  YEAH, YEAH, and a HELL YEAH for this place!!!

It is a small place, but the service and the food was good.  1.  Chicken Teriyaki - Grilled chicken with sauce 2.  Chicken Tatsuta - Deep fried chicken marinated in garlic and ginger  The HH menus are a great value!!!  Get here early,  because the tables fill up fast!!!

I have been to the Tag's in North Phoenix, so I was excited to see if this West side one is good as the original.    Been to this location twice, once with a group of 12 for dinner and once with my husband for lunch.  Both times we had great food and excellent service.  Had the chicken fettuccine for dinner and had the chicken parmesan sandwich for lunch.  YUM for both visits.    Going back soon!

Ok.  I have been missing out.  I have never tried their pizza.  My brother and I stopped in for Sunday lunch after shopping.  It was pretty empty (I hope business picks up for them).  Anyways, I ordered the regular 14th ST. Special (oval thin pie loaded with sausage, mozzarella, parmesan, & romano.  OMG!  It was SO good.  I keep telling my brother to take it.  He did, and he eat 2 slices.  YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!  Next I need to drag my husband in to try it!

Been back several times after the March 2010 review.  This weekend I was finally there with my husband.  He tried the pizza and loved it!  I got my usual 14th Street Pizza, but this time it is SPICY!  My mouth was on fire and I was coughing.  Got the attention of the waitress and told her that I have had this pizza several times and it was never spicy.  The Manager saw something wrong, and she came by to find out what she could do.  They made another pizza for me.  The second pizza was GREAT.  A little disappointed that the food was not consistent.  Sorry, need to bring it down to 4 stars.

Came here for HH.  Sat at counter area by the open kitchen.  I ordered the cheeseburger and comes with mixed sweet potato & truffle fries.  Then I added petite crispy raviolis.  Everything was so so good and flavorful.  The service was fantastic.  And sitting at the open kitchen, it was neat to see the other dishes and seeing the chefs prep for a large party.

I have been trying to come to this place for years, but the number of cars in the parking lot & people waiting outside is a little intimating.  LOL!  I finally told my brother we are going for lunch and that is it.    Country Fried Chicken Platter was my pick for poison - Chicken was at the right thickness, batter was just spot on (not too thick and the right amount of crunchy), then the country gravy (ahhhhhhhahhh- yes, that is me singing).  I paired this poison with mac & cheese and mash potatoes.  WOW!  GREAT STUFF!  I was so busy stuffing my face, I forgot to save room for dessert.    I sat in the room by the window where the kamikaze birds hit the window, scary at first but then if the window was not there, they would be hitting me???

Our lazy asses did not cook this Friday night, so we decided to Filibertos it!  We always call in our order (they need a cc # if the order is over $10).  It was 15 to 20 mins. we show up at the place for pick up.  They forgot to make our order.  They apologized and offered us free drinks.  We declined the free drinks but they offered again.  We declined and they told us the order will be done in a few mins.  They apologized again when we got our order.    Rolled tacos with cheese - Crunchy yumminess Sausage breakfast burritos - Hello breakfast at 8pm  Pollo Carne burrito - Love the chicken  Combos meals Yum yum yum to all!   Plus...24 hours and drive thur.

We came here after a long day of shopping and freezing!!!  All 4 of us felt like soup and apps.  We were greeted right away and seated right away.  Cool!  The server came to welcome us and took our drink orders.  She seemed to be in a rush and a little short with us, okay!  She came back with our drinks and took our food order.  She seemed irritated that we were only ordering soups and an app.    Chicken Enchilada Soup - It was good, but again a tad salty for me.   Triple Dipper:  Wings Over Buffalo - Good and spicy                            Fried Cheese - Good and gooey                            Original Chicken Crispers - Good and cripsy  The server's attitude bring down the mood.

I never knew this store existed until I accidentally got lost looking for the Super Target. Then I was like what the hey, I will stop and look around. LOVE IT! This Home Goods is attached to a TJ Maxx. Even better, they have home items and clothes too. I was in awe...   I found diffusers, bed sheets, decoration for the house, and then wander over to TJ Maxx for the clothes. I never make it to the Super Target. I found everything and more that I was looking for. The prices are decent too!

I was one of the 100+ guest with Michele's mixer. It was crazy!! There was already a handful of people from a convention staying at the hotel in the bar area. Michele group came in and was just standing around all over (host station, bar area, circle area, hallways, etc), the District not enough tables or chairs ready. Problem is the District knew of this event and the area was suppose to be reserved. Instead we had a sea of people just trying to get drinks from the bar, because they had no table for the servers to take their order. I stood in the hallway near the restrooms and watched 4 managers (their had their name tags on their blazers, very important people) do nothing to solve the problem except for just watch the sea of people and their drowning servers. They were there for 20 mins and just left. I noticed there was another part of the place complete empty with plenty of tables and chairs, but that portion of the District was not opened for the 100+ standing guests in the bar area. I did not get it??? In this economy, doesn't the business want people to have chance to SPEND money? After 1 hour later, I got a dirty table in the circle area, but no server in sight to clear off the table or to see what is on the menu. I had to stop a server to come clean up the table and provide menus for us. The drinks, food, and dessert was fabulous!! It was not the servers fault for being inattentive, it was the managing team's FAULT for not being prepared for a reserved mixer.

I have been here several times since it opened. Love the happy hour food and drinks. The happy hour appetizers are full size (not like some places during hh they cuts qty in half). So far, everything I have tried has been good. No complaints on the food. Service is hit and miss depending on the server.

Jill was very helpful to get my cruise booked for Sept.  She made sure the rooms were booked side by side or across the hall from each other.  Made sure we had the same dinner time and the reservations were tied in together.  And told me to come back with passport and excursion if I wanted her to book them.  Awesome!

I want to start off, I love Target.  Throw a SUPER in front of it = OMG!  This Target is rated 4 starts because I am not loving the lay out.  It is a little confusing in the toilertries/comestics/medicine/air fresheners area.  I had to go and forth a few times.  It is big, clean, well lit, large selections, and just SUPER!

WOW!  The teas are so good.  It beats all the teas that I have tried before.  I was a big fan of The Republic of Tea, I think I have 1 or 2 containers of every different types of tea (green, white, red, etc).  After tasting the samples and getting the White Ayurvedic Chai and Samurai Chi Mate, I am hooked on Teavana.  Thanks, M.  It is your fault!

I have been to this location several time and I still love it!  Lots of healthly selections and just love the atmosphere in the outdoor and indoor seating.  My favies:  the matcha lemonade (it is off the menu, but they can still make it for you), edamame dumplings, herb hummus, house-made chicken sausage pizza, flourless chocolate cake, and ice creams.  The service is always on par and quick.  Also nice and relaxing here.  This is one of my go to places!

This place is awesome....  And this is HUGE!  Plenty of spaces at all the amenities.   I have never been to Moroccan but I imagine it would be like this.  They have plenty of services to choose from.  I got the 50 mins of classic massage.  It was very relaxing.  When the lady doing my message found out I was celebrating my birthday late there, she got me a gift certificate for a coffee or gelato at the cafe.  That is so sweet.  Plus, you get to pick a card from the pot:  My card says - Stretch out your hand and receive the world's wide gift of joy, appreciation and beauty. - Connie Roosevelt Robinson

We came here for a day at the spa.  We kicked off our visit to Prado for brunch.  Love the place and the surroundings.  We were greeted right away and had the choice to sit inside or outside.  I chose inside since it was a little warm still.    The server was a little slow in drinks, refills, getting the bill, and she forgot to bring a drink.  She was hard to flag down or get attention of.    I ordered the ham and cheese omlette, it was ok.  Bland, just bearly cooked to done and just not too great.  The potatoes were not fully cooked, still crunchy.    Meh...

I liked the big parking lot, decor, and space in the dining area.  We had a party of 10 and they took reservations.  Plus plus plus plus!!!  We were seated swiftly and our server came over immediately to take our drink orders.  She was back right away with our drinks.  We had to wait for some of the others in our party to show up.  After waiting 10 mins, we were noitifed that the others were not showing up.  BOO. We got the server's attention and she came over to take our order.  I ordered the meat lover omlette.  The eggs were a little too done but tasty flavor.  The potatoes were good too.  The service was excellent!!!  Never an empty cup and she bought an extra plate without us asking for the kids.  She even offered togo ice teas for us.  WHOA.

I had to drop it down to 2 stars.  The food was the same quality, but they do not bring out big bowls of white and brown rice anymore.  They brought out 5 small bowls of rice when there are 7 of us.  Are we suppose to share or have our individual bowls?    We had our usuals: 2 chicken fried rice - ok 2 mongolian beef - good 2 chicken chow mein - good 2 crispy honey chicken - good 1 orange peel chicken - meh... 1 spicy chicken - too spicy for me, but the group said it was good  Main reason for the 2 stars was the service SUCKED!  We had to literally get our servers attention for anything (refills, more rice, togo boxes, etc.).  We waited 15 mins for our server to pick up the check, he never showed!  So we handed it off to other server and asked if she can help us.  He came back to the table only the times we can grab he attention.  We were always out of drinks.  I have not had that BAD of a service in a long time.  I will not come back on my own, but if the family wants to then they can drag me along (kicking and screaming).

I spotted this Petsmart on the way to a Yelp event at Don and Charlie's.  I need to get a new water dispenser for my 3 monsters.  This location is clean, neat, and nice.  The staff is super friendly.  I was greeted immediately walking in.    I did not find the water dispenser I wanted but I did find peanut butter flavor rawhide treats on sales for my fuzzy kids.    This location has a PetsHotel.  It is so cute, like checking in at a real hotel.  =)

I have been here several more times, I guess it is time for a re-review.  The food has improved and the service too...  This family owned place looks like it is doing good!!  Soy milk - YUM  Fried egg rolls - Every good!  Bun Thit Nuong - the grilled pork was good, the noodles were just right, and the fish sauce added made it very good.

Came here for G's birthday.  That is nice of them to take reservations for us.  We had 11 of us.  The service was great.  The place can get a little loud.  I ordered hummus and grilled chicken with pine nuts served with pita!  Very good a little salty then normal.  Never had to ask for a refill - Awesome!

So far this is the best Thai food, I can find on the West side.  Had the fried egg rolls, satay chicken, pad-thai, thai bbq chicken, and pepper steak.  WOW, it was good and the service was great!  I loved that we tasted all the different favors of all the foods.    Going back soon, need to try more items from the menu!

I have never been a fan of Olive Garden, but a brand new and shiny one opened up on the west side by home. My husband and I thought OK, we will try it again after years. DUH, dumb decision!! Was a total disappointment. Why do we do that to ourselves? You do not like somethings for some reasons! Sticking with gut feel next time.   Got the fried mussel de napoli, that was ok. The usual mussel cooked and bathe in garlic butter sauce. I ordered the chicken alfredo pizza. OMG, it was so salty! I could barely eat it. Dipping it into the chicken & gnocchi soup to wash off the salt. I should have returned the food, but I have worked in the restaurant business through high school and college, I know what happens to returns! No thanks... My husband's spaghetti with meat sauce was kind of bland. We did not taste the herbs and spices in the sauce.   Actually, the food only deserves a 1 star but the service was outstanding from a young lady, so I am forced to gave 2 stars.

Did not stay here, but I would have loved too. Loved the vibe, look, and feel to this place. The pub restaurant smelled so good walking in. The check in area was nice and huge. The casino was a good size. They have good ice cream at Jean Phillipe's. This is on my list to stay!

I have been to this place over 10 times...  I am sad to say the food is getting worst and worst...  What gives?  Each time we go, I hope it gets better.  Nope...  The service has gotten worst too.  Hum, I might not return again...  But my husband loves the place...

Three of us tried this place for dinner today.  Not bad at all for a wing joint.  We had the one of the pizza/wing specials (30 Wings and 1 XL pizza with 1 top).  They let us split the wings..  10 HOT, 10 medium, and 10 mild.  We ordered a pepperoni for the 1 item.  The service was great.  The waiters came be a lot to check on us.    Wings were saucy and still crispy!  Pizza was thin and cheesy!  Everything was good...  The price on the drinks are not bad either.. Lot of TVs, so many things to watch.  Yeah, we will be back!

It was the first time for my husband and I to try Indian cuisine.  We both liked it very much.  Yes, we will be coming back to this place!!  We ordered the Non-Veg Assorted Snack (Seesh Kebab, Fish Pakoras & Chicken Pakoras) for an appertizer.  The Seesh Kebab was minced lamb mixed with spcies cooked on skeker in clay oven, not like the normal kebab you think it is.  The taste was different, not my cup of tea.  But the fish and chicken Parkora was very good.  For our entrees ordered up a Karahi Lamb-Boti Masala (boneless tansoori lamb in a tomatoe and butter gravy) and Chicken Biryani (basmati rice with chicken cooked with nuts, herbs, raisins, and spices).  The Karahi Lamb dish was served as medium and the Chicken Biryani was served as mild.  The lamd dish was too HOT for me (but then I am a super lightweight), but the flavor was good.  I loved my Chicken Biryani, the aromatic rice, herb, and spices was just wonderful to smell and taste.  The waitress suggested the Garlic Naan bread.  It was like a pita with small chunks of garlic and herb.  It was very tasty too.    We got to chatting with the owners.  They were very patience to explain what everything was and give us different sauces to try (cucumber yogurt, minty cream, etc.) with our dishes.  They also brought out a sample of the Kheer (rice pudding), my husband inhaled it.  He loved it!

Came here for a wedding and it was breath taking.  Wedding ceremony on held on the one of the driving areas that overlook the golf course and into the city.  The sunset was just beautiful.  The clubhouse has amazing and relaxing environment.  We had drinks on the patio (great for photos).  Had heater lamps so we ate on the other side of the patio.  The food was pretty good.  Steaks, chicken, and fish.  Tons of sides and bread.  Service was top notch (bar, servers, etc.).    +++Rabbits & family of deer spotted in the background!

Gallo Blanco is inside the Claredon Hotel...  Loved the feel to the place.  We had a party of 15, so they arranged an area in the bar/lounge area.  It was nice since we had some kids with us.    I ordered the 1/2 Pollo Asado (Citrus marinated grilled local chicken w/ Aji Aioli and tortillas) and WOW!  It was SO good.  The server told me to ask for more tortillas if I needed them.  And yes, I took her up on her offer.  The chicken was cooked just perfect (juicy and no red).  The tortillas were warm and just plain good.    The service was great for a table of 15!  Everyone was happy and in a food coma!  =)

Wow, last review was from 2009.  I guess I would update.  They have changed owners  from the original set when they first started.  I ordered take out.  Again it is Friday and my laziness kicks in.  I got:  Chicken Chow Fun - Delicious and love the wok "breathe" or air when you open the container Creamy Chicken Corn Soup - Huge portion, but the soup seemed bland..  But the crispy wontons I ordered extra and a little salt fix that up. Chicken with Cashew Nuts - Yummy!!  Perfect!  I need to stop by for a sit down meal soon!!!

Went on a Friday night, thank goodness we got there before 8:30pm.  They close at 8:30pm!  It was packed at 8:10pm!!!!  It smells so good.  I got the beef chimi with sour cream, 2 beef flautas, and 1 butter tortilla.  Everything was GREAT!  So happy to have Carolinas on the west side!

We meet at Local Breeze for a Sunday brunch. I found parking right next to the restaurant. M was already there with a table on the outside patio. There was a wait for the inside. OK, they have mister system and water coolers for the outside patio. It was not too bad. The service on getting our order was a little slow but it seems like she was spread throughout the patio.   They were serving breakfast and lunch. A lot of selection, but since I do not get breakfast food much I had to get the Coke Cola Ham and White Cheddar Cheese Omelet served with country potatoes and wheat bread. The rest of the table got Eggs Benedict and 2 Downtown's Favorite Breakfast. Everything was so good. I love French toast so I must try next time. Loved the atmosphere, but it started to get HOT. It took awhile before we could get our check. If the service can improve, then it would be perfect.

Went on a rainy Friday night with my girlfriends.  Again, we found parking right across from the front doors.  Sweet!  Walked in and loved the feel you get.  It is like hanging out at a friend's place, very comfortable.  We stood at the counter for mins.  Can not decide!!  I got Hot Chocolate (LARGE).  OMG, LOVED it.  It was so good.  YUM!!  Saw the yummy baked goodies, but we had treats left over from dinner to munch on.    After I finished my hot chocolate, I was back at the counter to buy a bottle water.  The girl behind the counter told me they have water on the counter by the front door and did not want me to pay $3 for the bottled water.  That was very sweet, I tipped her for that.

We came on a Saturday night around 8pm with 12 of us.  The wait was 1 hour, but the outside patio was available.  No problem!  We sat in the outside patio and our server came by quickly.  She took our drink orders and came back with drinks pretty fast.  Then she took our food order.  While we were waiting sprinkles of rain, dust, and leaves came our way and into some of our drinks and appetizers.  We moved our party inside and Arcadia Tavern was helpful.    I ordered my prime dip with french fries.  The prime dip was pretty good and I am not sure how the fries tasted because I got tater tots.  It was a super busy night, so I did not want to say anything.  The tater tots were ok, I am not too much of a fan.

We had a group of 8.  We were sat quickly.. SWEET!  The ambiance very west elm, loved it. The service was great and very attentive, my drink was refilled without ask.  And one time, I did not even know it was refilled...  Ninja waiters?   We order the meat and cheese appetizer... YUM!  I ordered the pepperoni pizza...  Thin crust, cheese is just right amount, not cheap on the pepperoni, and the basil was fresh...  Need to drag my foodies girls to this place...

I thought going at 1pm I would avoid the lunch crowd.  WRONG!  This place was packed to the gills!  The line was all the back by the double entry doors.  It does move quickly!  And after I paid, I went to fill up my drink before I found my seat, my food found me.  They have a 2 for deal now:  I got mac & cheese and 1/2 a sandwich.  The mac & cheese was GOOD.  I got the turkey sandwich with swiss & mayo.  OK, this sandwich was GOOD.   Love the cookie that comes with the meal.

I have not been to a Jason's Deli in a long time.  The Chandler location is the first time I have been there...   Still love it!  So many things to pick from.  We went there, because my sister wanted soup.  And plus we had the 4 and 2 year old...  They can not sit still in a sit down restaurant.    I got the daily special soup:  Chicken Pot Pie.  It was so good.  The mini puff pastry was a nice touch.  Loved it!  Then I got the New York Yankee sandwich.  The sandwich was HUGE.  And it was GOOD!  It was good food and good company from my sisters and the kids.

Not sure if Angel Sweet to switching to Gelato Spot or vice versus.  The door and sign says Angel Sweet but the cups and receipt said Gelato Spot.  Me confused!  Either way, roasted almonds and new york cheesecake is YUM!  1 minus - the employee was so NOT happy to be there.  We got some attitude.  Sorry for intruding your work time.

We got there around noon on a Tuesday.  It was dead, only 1 guy at the bar.  We waited for about 3 mins before someone noticed we were waiting for a table.  I should have known better to dine without checking Yelp first.    We got seated and the hostess notified us that she is also our server.  She took our drink orders.  And she was back right away with our drinks.  She took our food order.  We both ordered a soup and an appetizer for lunch.  We waited 15 mins and our soups came out  within 5 mins our food came out too.  IRISH POTATO SOUP - it came out warm, there was only a few chunks of potatoes, and tasted ok.  CHICKEN FINGERS - the chicken was not crispy but hard.  The fries were  good!  Service was actually good.  The food is not so good.

I love the color blue.  So when I walked in, I fell instantly in love with the decor.  We were greet immediately and sat in the tables in the middle of the room.  Review the menus and cool idea, Build Your Own Burger!  Total of 6 steps...  Pretty cool, since I am kind of a picky eater.    I got the angus beef (well, no moo-ing), wheat bun, swiss cheese, and mayo.  There are a ton of other selections to add, but I am a plain jane when burgers come into play.  Got the side of fries.  For a burger that is well, it was still very juicy and tasty.  Not dried and hockey puck style.  I was very happy...  Then...  dessert time...  Got the pizza cookie!    Very good...  The comb of half baked cookie and ice cream with all the good food put me into a food coma...    Our server was great and attentive.  The manager stepped in to help the server during a slight rush of people, he was attentive and funny.  Loved the personal attention we received.    Great food + great service = excellent dining experience!

Came here on a Saturday night around 8:50pm.  The place is like any sports bar, cool.  We were greeted promptly by the hostess.  She was nice and bubbly.  We sat in the booth and waited 5 mins before we are acknowledged by server.  It took another 5 to 7 mins before she came back to take our drink orders.  Then the drinks came pretty quick.  Then 15 mins go by before she is available to take our food.  We ordered appetizers and dinner.  It was 25 mins before the wings came and then the kicker was the wings were barely warm.  We were so hungry we inhaled them.  The medium was quite warm and the terriyaki was ok.  Our food took another 20 (Yes, 10pm) our dinners came.  The Margherita pizza and the M.J. Cordon Bleu sandwich was also good and served HOT but they messed up on the side, they put cole slaw instead of french fries.  The server brought my fries after another 10 mins.  We found out later from the server that the manager let some servers go earlier in the night.

I went there for lunch today.  The park lot is small that is near the building, you can park on the side of it for more room.  The place is set up to order at the counter.    I had the quesdilla paquime with chicken $5.25.  The chicken was breaded, pounded thin,  and yummy.  I eye balled the deserts (ice cream, pudding, flan, cakes, popsicles, etc.)and different drinks (bottled sodas, canned sodas, shakes, & fruit drinks).  OMG!  Too bad, I was already full.

I was craving Chinese, so on my way house from work I stopped in to order take out. Ordered chicken wings, egg flower soup, pork egg foo young, and wok fried chicken. The pork egg foo young and wok fried chicken was too salty. The chicken wings and egg flower soup was OK. I am not sure if I would try it again.

We had a party of 5 celebrating a b-day! I am giving them 1 star not because of the food, it was because of waiting for over 1 hour for our food. After an hour of waiting and watching the other par tons leave because they can not wait, our appetizers came out then the soup. Then one by one our dishes came flowing out of the kitchen. The b-day girl insisted for us to wait, because to her the food is one of the BEST. The food was good, but not the BEST. Was it worth the hour wait? NO!

I was there on a Friday night.  We had 10 people in our group.  They had more employees this time and I am glad.  The food is good and we did not have to wait a hour for food.  The service could be better, had to ask for refills and someone to take our order.  We ordered:  Appetizers:  Angel wings and #10 combo appetizers (chicken stay, chicken egg rolls, fried wontons, Thai toast, and fish patties)  All of the appetizers were GOOD!    Entrees:  2 BBQ chickens; green curry with beef; 2 tom guy soups; pork fried rice, pineapple fried rice, pad saw yee noodles, pad thai noodles, and green beans with pork.  The BBQ chickens were good but dry (need to apply the sweet chili sauce).  The tom guy soup were mild (but my mouth was on FIRE).  Everything else was GOOD!!  Everyone took a leftovers for lunch!

My brother and I decided to go try Greek Gyro Express for lunch today. Went in and they were a little busy. We walked to the counter, they do not have a menu posted on the wall, just pics only a few selections. I found the to go menu on the counter, so pick it up found a few more selections. As we were deciding the order, the owner (I think) came out with a few samples of the gyro meat and told us to try. WOW, it is was good... Very good!   I ordered the chicken pita meal (chicken gyro with onions, tomatoes, and Tzatziki; included Greek fries and a drink). My brother ordered the combo two meat plate (gyro, chicken, salad, tomatoes, onion and a drink). As we sat, the owner came out and told us to try the complementary soup (lemon, chicken and rice). I got two small bowls so we could try it. You know what? It was pretty good. I likie!   The good came out looking just like the pictures on the wall. My chicken pita was very tasty and the Greek fries (fries with feta cheese) good. Everything was very good. My brothers plate looked good too. He inhaled it, so I am assuming he liked it. =)   Next time, I think I might try the gyro pita.

I was there with a group of 20 people for hour happy, it was packed at 5pm when I arrived. I sat with my group. It took over 10 mins before I could get our server's attention. After that, every time I needed a refill or anything I need to wait to get her attention. It was a great place to hang out with friends, but not impressed by the service.

Have I mentioned that I love this place?  It is always clean, friendly employees, and fresh foods.  I am writing a review again because we came here the day before Thanksgiving to pick up goodies to bring to the in-laws.  I saw flowers that were a great center piece, so I got them.  Guess what?  I paid for all my goodies and left the flowers on the bagging area.  I got home unpacked, had dinner, getting ready for bed, and thought about where did I put the flowers.  I searched the car, garage, the house, and no flowers.  We went back on Thanksgiving morning to see we can get the same flowers or another bunch.  They were so nice and let us get any flowers at the same price.  Awesome!

I agree with Emily J.'s review.  I don't love Hula's but I like it!    We sat on the patio by the heat lamp.  It was pretty dark in on the patio around 6:30pm.  We sat, we ordered, and we waited, waited, waited for the food.  It was a long while before our food came out.  We did not see what the food looked like.  It was so dark out.  The food was alright, but nothing that will make me drive out to eat there on purpose.    The server was very friendly!  The hostess was a little rude.

Came here for my bday lunch with my hubby.  The staff was super friendly.  Our server was the BOMB, but he just spoke so softly it was hard to hear him!  He was super attentive (like he was reading our minds).  We both ordered the:  Triple Prime Bacon Cheddar Burger (with aged New York cheddar and applewood smoked bacon) and fries.  Mine was excellent and the fries were just perfect.  But of course my husband has to be special, he added guac and red onions to his.    Four Way Sampler:  Crispy chicken strips - GOOD, fire wings - TOO spicy for me, southwestern spring rolls - sorry Chili's still is the king , and fried mozzarella - they were OK.  Our service got us filled togo cups with our drinks.  +++

M and I stopped in for lunch today.  The set up reminded me of a CPK.  The server was awesome...  He was there checking and making sure everything is good.  I like!  I order the creamy garlic chicken pasta (Roasted chicken, creamy garlic sauce, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes served on penne).  Very good.  And the portion is fairly large.  I should NOT have tried to eat all of it.  Now, I can bearly type or think (FOOD COMA).    It is Friday and what the hey, I ordered a Dreamsicle (A dreamy orange cream soda mixed with sprite, mandarin-orange &vanilla syrups, and a splash of cream.).  It was good....  They also serve a complentary bread (warm, sliced, garlic, & red onions).  I do not know if we were hungry or it was GOOD, we had a second plate.  LOL!  We dipped the bread into the olive oil and balsamic vinegar mix.  YUM!

I decided to stop by on my way back from ABC decorations.  I saw the place was busy so must mean pretty good food?  Yeah, I was wrong.  Ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl, you cannot go that wrong with it.  The sauce was so sweet.  It was like eating maple sauce with chicken and rice.  Too sweet for my taste.  I should have read the Yelp review before I went there.

I lightly bumped the curb because this stupid lady was parked in the middle of the road.  I waited a few mins and noticed that she was not going to move.  So I decided to go around her and I did not see the curb was shaped funny (zig zag like pattern) so I nicked it.  When I got home I saw a crack in my tire.  =(  DAMN IT!  So I went to Discount Tire to check on the status of my tire.  I thought great, $$$ to replace it.  He nice rep checked it out and said I am good to go.  No problems, that part of the tire is there for the wheel protection and it did the job.   That is great he did not try to pressure sell me a new tire.

This is my 2nd time here.  It is pretty good size and has a lot of things.  Somethings you were NOT even looking for.  Their prices seem slightly higher than the other Asian markets but it is clean!    I found everything I was set out to buy, I am happy to not have to run to different stores.

We had 13 of us and it was nice they told us to come at 7:30pm on a Saturday so they can set up for us.  When we got there we still had to wait 15 mins.  It was cold outside!!!  We finally got in and noticed they only had 1 server for the whole place to do everything (ordering, busing, serving, etc.).  The service was slow but she is really nice.  The food took FOREVER!!!  I got gyoza, they were ok.  I got the dumpling with rice cake soup.  It was not that flavorful.  So bummed...

I had an unexpected visit from the Lee family.  They were on the west side of town, so they called and said dinner?  YEAH, I am there.  Asian food?  OK.  Thai?  OK.  Sala Thai was choice, thanks Yelp!!!  It is tucked into a strip mall with a Fry's.  Easy to spot.  It was nice, clean, but only a few tables filled when we got there.  We sat next to the fish tank filled with plastic toy fishes.  The kids were amazed.  We ordered:  Chicken Satay - It was pretty good, love the peanut sauce. Tom Yum Soup - A and J said VERY SPICY but good Phad-See-Ew with Beef - The kids inhaled it Thai BBQ Pork -  They are actually pork chops.  Pretty good. Pineapple Fried Rice - YUM.    The service was good (even from the new employee).  3.5 stars.....

I love this place...  I purchased the $20 unlimited classes for the week..  I took:     -Beginner's Yoga with Becci on Sunday - Learning the poses and slow enough for a newbie to figure out what the heck is going on.  -Slow Flow Yoga with Nicki on Tuesday - It was so awesome to destress at the end of the night.  Slept like a baby!  -Vibrational Flow with Sandra on Wednesday - I am not too thrill or use to the gong, but I liked the instructions for all the poses.  -Yoga Flow & Restorative with Jennifer on Saturday - Love our engery and vibe on a Saturday morning.  Going back for week #2!

I have been going to this Chipotle for about two year now. Love Chipotle!! Most of the time to get the food to go. The quality and quantity of the food has not changed at all. Everything is fresh and delicious every time. I get my usual, burrito with chicken, black bean, rice, cheese, and a little sour cream. Add a bag a chips (whatever fall out of the burrito is scooped up by the chips. YUM! We just went tonight.

I MURDERED my two month old touch IPOD that I got for Valentine's day.  I dropped it and the screen just broken into million pieces.  I still worked and you could potential get cut from the little pieces of uneven glass.  I was so mad at myself.  =(  I scheduled an appointment (online is EASY).  I got there on time and a apple person stop me mid-store to talk if I needed help.  I told her that I had an appointment, so she found me and checked me in.  Told me to sit in this chair and so-so will be with me.  So you are sitting with 3 other people that need help.  WIthin 3 mins the apple genius person came to introduce himself and listen to my issues.  He said ok, we can replace that with a new ipod for $99.00 +tax.  He advise to update or upload everything to icloud so we can get the one set up.  Since I only loaded music on it, I didn't have to move anything to the icloud.  I didn't have a chance to play with it (so sad).  Within 20 mins, I got a brand one ipod and off on my way.    Happy the service was fast and friendly, but the amount of people there working or waiting for help is crazy.  Like bees buzzing everywhere when I was sitting in the chair and waiting for help.  Happy with my ipod but it lives in a bubble now.  =)

I rented a full size, but they did not have one ready.  They offered a free upgrade to a SUV.  So, we took it.  In and out in less than 10 mins.  NICE!    We were suppose to bring back the rental on Wednesday at 6pm, but due to traffic in CA we missed the 6pm closing time.  We called before hand to inform them we were going to be late due to traffic.  The branch manager, William Ray said if I bring back the rental by 7:30am on Thursday, they will not charge me extra.  But I did receive a call from another person from the branch said that they will charge me when I was on the road.  I told him was William said and all he said was but you are late.  Maybe I will charge you 1/2 a day???  WTF!!!    When I returned the rental on Thursday morning, I did not say anything to see what the charges were.  No, they did not charge me an extra day or charges.  And I was out of there in 5 mins.  I am not sure what the mis-communication was but in the end it worked out.

This place is too cute!  My brother has been telling me about it, but I have not gone yet.  I am so glad I did.  They have a ton of things to select from.  I tried these:  1.  Vanilla cupcake - she freshly piped the frost on while we were waiting and topped with 2 sugar flowers.  WOW, the frost it not overly sweet so it was perfect.  The cake was awesome and moist.    2.  Almond bar (butter cookie crust topped with goowey carmel sliced almonds)  -it is just awesomely good.  3.  Belgium Chocolate Mousse - YUM, WOW, HUM - Great stuff!  I cannot wait to order my dad's sugar free cake here!!!!

I ordered the sugar free cake for my dad's birthday.  Delicous White Cake, sugar free, with custard cream filling, and with whip cream topping.  Yes, everything was sugar free.  3 tiers of goodness.  I love that this sugar free cake had NO after taste at all.  My dad was so happy and loved the taste, he had seconds.  he he he!  Thanks, Shelley and Michelle!!!    My husband HAD to get other goodies where we were at the bakery: Kay's brownie - it is like a PARTY in my mouth (rice crispy, chocolate, brownies, peanut butter, etc.)....  Oatmeal Caramelation Bar - oatmeal cookie crumbled on top of chocolate and topped off with homemade caramel, my husband did not even share a bite.  After he inhaled it, he called Shelley to tell her that he saw God.  It guess it was that good?    Dutch Apple Pie (?) - whatever the name was, it was so good that he inhale his too and I only got to see the empty plastic container.

Came on here on a Saturday night after dinner.  The staff is super friendly.  Ask for sample cups if you want to taste the flavors.  Everything is yummy!  I got coconut, vanilla, and nutella.  And of course the selection of toppings are endless.  I loaded on sliced almonds and chocolate sprinkles.  Plenty of seating for the 5 of us!  Check in on yelp and get the second one FREE!

My brother and I have a goal for 2010; we will be hiking every week.  Our first hike was at Estrella Mountains, since it was close to my house and it allowed dogs.  I am so out of shape, so we picked the Baseline trail 2.4miles to kick off our weekly hike.  We arrived at 8:30am.  I think the entrance fee was $5 or $6 per car.  The park staff gave us a map of the trails and the park.  We located our trail and drove directly to the starting point.  Park was easy and plenty of space.   We started our hike on a gorgeous day, a little chill, but the awesome view made it nice.  My dog, Wasabi, loved it.  Smell the plants, run on the tail, and climb on rocks.  She has a ball.  We loved the hike too.  It was quite.  We did not see anyone until we were almost finished with the hike.  They have 11 different trails and some of them are shared path.  You can combine different rails to enhance your hiking experiences.

Stopped in for lunch with M.  I got the Mahi Mahi Quesa (Oaxaca cheese, mahi mahi fish, poblano pepper, mushrooms, onion, fresh garlic and Mexican herbs) and a large rasberry lemonade.  I asked if I can have the quesa without pepper (not a big fan), they said ok.  But it still came with it.  The quesa was HUGE!  It was really good.  The total came to $10.27, a little more $$ than I thought it should be.

Ok, I finally got a chance to come back with some coworkers. They changed their format. The first time I was there, it was go to the counter order and they give you a number. They have waiter service this time. I got the Sonora Arrachera Quesa (Oaxaca cheese & char-broiled Arrachera steak). It was so good and too much for me to finish. I looks at my fellow lunchers and their tacos looked so GOOD. The salsa bar is filled with all sorts of varieties. I tried the strawberry salsa, too sweet for my taste... but more to favors to try!

L and I were partying like rock stars on the strip.  Then all of a sudden midnight hunger pains began.  Of course, Yelp HELP!  The portions are HUGE, so L and I split a ham, spinach & cheddar farm scramble (scrambled eggs, ham, spinach, & cheddar cheese served with roasted potatoes and fresh fruit).  The server was awesome.

Went on a Friday night again, the place was pretty packed (inside and out in the patio). We decided to get our food to go this time. The girl at the ordering counter was super nice and friendly. We even tipped her because she was so nice. I ordered a create a burger: 1/2 lb, classic egg bun, swiss cheese, and light mayo. The burger was juicy and just so so good. The smash fries are good too. My hubby got the AZ Smashburger: Habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipotle mayo, and fresh jalapenos on a chipotle bun.   The burgers just tasted very juicy and a lot better than last time.

I got the invisible shield on about over a year ago.  It finally start to peel off at the top, then when I got it hooked on my pocket and game over.  =(  I took it back to the kiosk by the food court and told the guy there HELP ME!  He said for an extra $5 they have a HD version (slick and slidy & super clear), SWEET!  SOLD!  I fell in love with my phone all over again.  The employee was nice and quick!

Ok, I really wanted to love this place.  Close to home and prices are decent.  It was on a Sunday morning.  It was gloomy, wind, and cold.  I NEEDED to get my toe did!  I signed in and was greeted by Tracy.  It was told to go check out the colors.  She got me a chair set up and told me to sit down.  They were pretty busy but a customer there brought her mom and 2 kids (1 toddler and 1 young kid).  The toddler was walking around everywhere and screaming.  The young kid was all over the shop and falling on the floor.  It just made my relaxing time not so relaxing.  =(    The service was good, the french pedicure looks good, the place is nice and new.  Just the screaming and running kids was distracting.  So this is a 3-1/2 stars.

This location of Kohl's is a stand alone store.  It is new, nice, and pretty big.  Has 2 to 3 entrances to the store and a huge parking lot.  The store is mapped out and labeled well, so you just need to look up at the signs for the department you want.    The only minor set back, they are short of cashiers sometimes.

My brother suggested for us to try to this place since it was close to his house. OK, do not have to ask me twice for food. LOL!   It was easy to find and a great little hide away place. YUM on food, Great for service, and Place is clean!   We both has to order the French Toast. It came with cinnamon butter. Yes, cinnamon butter.  It was so good.  Light, eggy, and just YUM for my TUM!  We split the hash browns.  YUM too...  They add their seasoning and just enough flavor to make it different.    I need to come back to try the other items on the menu...

My father in-law recommends this place highly. This place is clean, very friendly, and awesome for pets. So we visited twice, learned all about their services and boarding options. We have booked a cabana and a casa grande for our fuzzy kids. They have full day daycare = means the dogs play all day on slides, water area, etc... Every night they have a bedtime snack. We can go on vacation without worrying about them.

We signed up our fuzzy kids to be staying for 5 days in the cabana and large casa grande (love the terms they use).   We drove them here and parked in their driveway area (with shade, straight in front of the doors).    Wasabi and Magnum ran inside.  They were greeted by Rachel (who they remember and love from the another boarding facility).  Rachel was another big reason we choose Pet and Mac's.  Each fuzzy kid was tagged with an id collar (like a hospital band).  They asked if anyone would be coming by to check on them or if we wanted, we can email them and they could status us their stay...  COOL!  I was very sad to wave bye to my fuzzy kids, but I needed to make it to the cruise in Long Beach.  During our vacation, I emailed with Pete and Mac's a few times.  Each time they would respond within hours.  It was nice to know what is going on.  And the updates were cute!  We dropped by to pick up the fuzzy kids.  It was neat.  They have a package prepared for us:  play time report cards, spaw (grooming) report card, and each fuzzy kid had an id card with their picture.  It was so nice.  The groomer happened by be at the front desk when we were there.  She mentioned a few things to us to check on the fuzzy kids health.  Nice to know they really care and look out for our fuzzy ones.

I had a $5 coupon in the mail so I was like what the heck. And is it next to Home Goods (one of my favie home decoration stores). I got to the store it is like a Famous Footwear with an auction going on. Most of the shoes are off brands and made cheaply. Then loudly over the speakers, they announce the specials for the moment. Felt like I was at the fair. I rather go to DSW if I am going to shop discount shoes.

I love heart (would live here) Target. This is my normal store that I go to. Always great smiling, friendly employees. The aisle and displays are set up well and not crowding the flow of traffic. I memorized that layout of this store, so I can go directly to the sections of the store I need to go. My hubby has prohibit me to wander, I buy every that had a sale sticker on it. =) The returns/exchanges are always painless.

I was here about a month ago looking for this George Foreman grill.  I could not find it on the shelf so I was told to go to Customer Service for a rain check because it was on sell.  Chris at Customer Service look at the ad and checked his hand held device.  He told me to wait a second.  3 mins later, he came back with one.  YEAH, CHRIS!!!!    Every time I am at this Target, someone always greets me or ask if I needed help.  Love this place!!!!

My last update was in 2010 so I figure I do a re-review.  We came here to celebrate my husband's birthday lunch.  The place was pretty packed for lunch but the service was still great.  I ordered a personal pizza Brooklyn Family style (pepperoni, sausage and fresh basil).  WOW, it was so so GOOD but a little pricey for a 10" pizza.  Everyone else enjoyed their food too.  We had a great time!

They had a great sale and I was looking for a washer and dryer.  Got 25% off the retail price, then an additional 15% with the Sear's card.  Then when checking out got an additional $10 off.  Free delivery and haul away!!!  One minor con...the salespeople are on commission so they can come on strong sometimes.

I changed to have a cheeseburger with bacon today (in honor of my nephew).  7 of us came to honor my nephew and celebrate my MIL's birthday.  Red Robin was his favie place and he LOVED the fries.    1 minor con..  They stuff 7 of us in this tiny booth.  We were a tight family unit!  =)

I remember Bahama Bucks from my old ASU days.  When one of the girls said let's go I was happy to!  I was glad to see one was down the street from where we were, so plus plus!  It is in the strip mall in a huge plaza.  It is by the Native New Yorker.    It was pretty packed on a Saturday night, so we waited for about 10 mins in line before it was our turn to order.  Ordered and then waited another 10 mins before our order was completed.  I ordered the blue coconut with cream, YUM!  I only had a baby size, it was just right!!!

My husband visited this place then came back to tell me about it. The employees have good knowledge about their product and are VERY VERY helpful. I went to get more dog food for our doggies. The awesome employee told me what was better for our picky and sensitive stomach girl dog. The employee offered to carry the 40lbs of dog food for me. That is so nice. Normally, I need to drag it outside by myself. The price on the food was very reasonable and if you buy 10 you get the 11 free if you join the club! It is free to join!!

I have always been in love with Chick-Fil-A and still am. I was first hooked on them in the shopping malls, then they appeared on campus at ASU. Seems to now found my home in Avondale!   My fave is the combo #1 with no pickle. I am not sure what spices they put in recipe, but it is addicting. All the employees are so happy to work there.  Love you Chick-Fil-A!

We went to Westgate for Yardhouse, but it was so packed.  And the wait for 2 people were 40 mins.  My teenage god-daughter was straving so we opted out to find somewhere else that served chicken tenders (her favie).  We reviewed the menu outside and ok, what the hey.  It is 3/4 full inside.  We were seated behind the bar.    We sat and ordered:  chicken strips with a side of french fries & french dip.  The chicken strips were plenty and they were good.  A light coat of crispy and chicken.  The french dip was GOOD, tasty beef slices, and au jus was perfect (normally I think most places makes it salty).    Our server was awesome, she checked on us many times and made sure our drinks were filled.  At the end of the meal, she brings the check and a cotton candy (HUGE and on the house from the owners).  It was very nice.  My teenager inhaled it.  LOL!

This was my first visit to the Vig Uptown.  I loved it!  The place, lighting, and food - all excellent!!  My brother and I took our mom out for a lunch and shopping outing.    All three of us got burgers.  Pretzel bun please....  Loved it.    Almost a 5 star, but the server was just not happy to be there.  He did not say hello, just took drink orders, and left.  Came back and took food order and left.  Checked on us once during our time there.  Had to flag him down for refills twice.  He dropped off the check without a word.

I totally agree with Rand H.  WOW, the best buffet in AZ.  I went to the Sunday Brunch event with my family.  The service was first class.  I did not find 1 item that did not taste good.  Asian food, Mexican food, Italian food, and American fare was ALL good.   Desserts were so good.  Too bad it was to early in day, I could not try a bite of everything.

HAND PULLED NOODLES...  I have had these before in Hong Kong and Cali.  Never expected in AZ.  These are as fresh as you can get your noodles!!!  Got the #18 - Beef with Oyster Sauce and I picked the standard ramen noodles.  The noodles were good and the flavor of the beef and oyster sauce was outstanding!!  The steamed dumplings were so so good.  YUM YUM!!!  Also ordered the milk tea with boboa (it was ok).    The service was ok too.  We were waiting for 2 more people to join us, they never came to take our drink order.  They waited for everyone to get there and then took our drinks & food order.

I had to try this place out for myself since all the Yelp reviews are raving about Ken's.  I was a walk in on Thursday after work.  OMG, this place is packed and people were still coming!  I got the hot stone pedi...  NICE!  The massage was great!  I had a little problem understanding my tech, but she had a sheet to point out the services so we worked it all out.  They offer you bottled water and are super nice.  I forgot to use my check in offer.  NEXT TIME!

Our fave India restaurant closed in Goodyear, so we decided to try this India Garden.  The restaurant is big and open.  Bollywood music videos were playing on the TVs.  When we got there we were the 2nd table of people in the whole place.  They serve both menu and buffet.  We opted to try the buffet since it looked good.  We headed for the buffet.  The dinner buffet consists of twenty different items.  I got the Basmati Rice, Tandoori chicken, chicken masala, Vegetable Samosa, and Kheer.  Everything was wonderful.  There was a lot more in the buffet, but I over did it.  Oh, also naan (we got the garlic naan) is included with the buffet, they will bring it to your table FRESH!   And hot chai tea.  All that was $10.99 per person.

This Walgreens smells NEW!  The store was so clean.  The employees were ALL so nice.  They seems to be everywhere around the corner to assist.  Love the layout.  It is new, nice, clean and kind of upgraded from the older Walgreens in town.

My dad is addicted to McD's I think.  Every time after my test and scans at the Mayo Clinic it is let's go to McD's.  We found this one pretty close and easy to get back on the 101.  This location was clean and the staff was friendly.  They walked our order out to us.  :)  Of course the food taste the same.

We came here for lunch and it was sad to see the place only had 1 table.  When we walked in there was no sign or any information telling you to order at the counter.  I finally saw the employee in the cooking area say hello and told me the menus are at the counter.  Just walk up and order when you are ready.    I ordered the ALFREDO PIZZA adding chicken (Alfredo sauce w/mozzarella cheese).  The crust was thin and crispy, the sauce was lacking a little, the mozzarella cheese and chicken was excellent.  I tired a slice of the SAL'S WHITE PIZZA and it was great.    Why no 5 stars?  No wait service.

I love the winter look at CityScape.  The ice staking ring in the middle.  Shops and restaurants.  The parking is plenty and confusing as heck when I came out of the elevator, LOL!  Where am I?

We have been in Avondale for 6 years.  We keep passing by TJ's all the time.  We finally FINALLY stop in today.  DUDE, I have been missing out on a good home cooked breakfast!  It is a local mom and pop joint (love those).  The service is super friendly and fast.  The portions are pretty good size and the food is quality stuff.    We walked in, they told us pick any table, we sat, and was greeted by our server in 5 seconds.  =)  I told a little long to read up on the menu.  I could not decide between breakfast or lunch.  But since the Yelp reviews were mostly on the breakfast, I can't go wrong!    I ordered the ranch house omelet (3 eggs, bacon, sausage, and cheddar cheese) and I picked hash browns plus an english muffin.  The omelet was very good, the eggs cooked just right, the bacon isn't that paper thin stuff or crumbled, it was chucks, the sausage was good, and the melting cheddar just made it all come together.    My hubby order the chili bean omelet (3 eggs, cheddar cheese, and topped with homemade chili, cheese, and onions).  He loved the omelet, but the chili was too tomato-y for him.  But he loves spicy chili that kick you in the teeth kind (NOT for everyone).  We also order the 3 piece french toast that we did not eat until we finished the omelet.  We should not have waited.  WHAT THE FRENCH TOAST?  Wow, it was SO SO SO SO SO+ good, it melted in our mouths.  3 good sized pieces lighty dusted with powder sugar and we found out the bread is homemade.  The bread is light, doughy, and just DARN good.    I think I found my new breakfast joint in my neighbor.  Next to come back for lunch and/or dinner.

Came here after hiking and was straving...  We had to put our name on the list but the wait was only 5 mins.  The server right away came and took our drink order.  Had to get the ice tea, I needed to cool off from the hike.    Ordered the Chicken Fried Steak (I know it defeats the purpose of my hike)....but it sounds so good.  And then it tasted so good...  The steak was pan fried and a light coating.  The country gravy on it was heavenly and the hash brown were da BOMB.  I also got sourdough toast to soak up the country gravy.    The food and service was excellent....  =)  Love this little old diner.

This place has amazing Asian BBQ.  The BBQ Pork and roasted pork is perfection.  The roast duck however was overcooked somewhat, so it was good but a tad on the dry side.  The congee (rice soup) sliced pork and preserved egg was very good and had tasty flavors.  The wonton egg noodle soup was very good too.  The soup base had it going on!  The service was good, especially if you spoke Cantonese with them.  Just one small con - I was barely able to slide into my seat, it was so small.  But def get there early, it is packed and the food goes quick.  Was there by noon and they were out of the fried bread sticks already.

I met M for breakfast on a Sunday morning.  The parking lot was FULL!  I was lucky that someone was backing out, so I did not have to circle the lot or park in on a side street.  M was there already, got a table and ordered me an OJ.  =)  The server was nice to give me a few mins to review the menu before she came back.  I ordered the Croissant Breakfast (two scrambled eggs with cheddar with  sausage on a butter croissant).  And I had to order the French Toast too.  I love French Toast!!!  The eggs were a little too runny for me but other than that it was good.  The French Toast was pretty darn good too.  The service was friendly and quick.

Went during lunch (This review is only for the sushi and dinning menu/side).  This was an El Paso before, they remodeled the place up pretty nice.  The server was extra super nice and friendly.  We heard her explain the menu for 5-10 mins to a couple of elder ladies over and over again.  Gyoza (pork dumpling) - Was pan fried and VERY GOOD  Sushi & Sashimi is a al carte (1pc per order - prices $1.5 to 3.5)    Octopus, Tuna, and Yellowtail - My husband said they were good  Chicken Tempura Lunch (Includes Miso soup, tempura veggies, and rice) - the light tempura batter was excellent.  When dipped into the tempura sauce, YUM YUM YUM...  Nabe Yaki Udon Lunch (Udon noodles with chicken, veggies, egg, & a shrimp tempura) - The soup base was good, noodles texture was just right, and all the goodies were very good too.    We will need to go back to try the tepanysaki side!!

OK, we came back for the tepanysaki side!  WHY did I wait?  It was so much fun, food was great, and the tepanysaki chief was AWESOME!    Had the Gyoza again!  Ordered the chicken and steak.  YUM!  Only one small note:  refills on drinks were slow.

We came back to the tepanysaki table again, our table side chef Leon was the bomb, and our wait service was wonderful.  Why the 2 stars?  The food was good and tasteful on the tepanysaki but the sushi got someone from our group sick.  He ordered the yellowtail, tuna, and octopus.  He was the only one that got food poisoning and he is the only one that had sushi.  After reading the other 2 reviews, it seems that they have issues with their sushi and raw foods.  That is not good that people are getting sick.

Yes, yes, yes...  This place rocks!  The server is cute, attentive, and awesome.  Modern decor, happening atmosphere, and great open space for large groups.  I was only doing the galentine day's with two awesome friends.  Greeted quickly and seated quickly for my reservation on Vday.  Ordered:  1.  ASIAN-GLAZED GRILLED CHICKEN SKEWERS - YUM!  great sweet/sticky glaze 2.  WOOD-GRILLED PORK TENDERLOIN:  sweet potato mash, sauté of bacon, French green beans and Brussels sprout leaves, zesty jus  - I have to say, it was very good and I almost ate everything off the plate. 3.  I got the chocolate graham cracker with chocolate mouse - My mouth has explosions of chocolatiness dancing.  SOOO  good!

We were greeted immediate.  We got seated for all 6 of us.  There are so many things to pick from.  I got noodles, rice, chicken, grilled meats, dim sum, fish, etc.  Everything was good.  The service was pretty good too.  1 con was that the tables were so close together that we keep bumping into the table behind us and vice versa.

This place is hidden in the Esplanade.  I never knew it existed until my Manager mentioned it for our team lunch.  I am always across the street for lunch or dinners.  And boy, I have been missing out!!!   I love the super contemporary and casual feel to the place.  The music made me feel like I was in a nightclub (good tunes and mixes) but it does not suit everyone in our party.  Oh well!    We were greeted immediately and sat upstairs.  The place only had about 6 tables total during the lunch rush (not too good).  The served free homemade chips and salsa.  The chips are warm, fresh, and super super crisp.  I love them.  I didn't even need salsa for the chips.  They are AWESOME!  The best chips I have ever had.  Yes, EVER!    I love the simple menu.  I opted out for the one of the specials, quesadilla with chicken street meat and cheese.  The tortilla was just very good not just like a regular flour store brought kind, this sucka was fresh.  The chicken street meat was the BOMB (slow roasted and braised with garlic clove, rosemary, and citrus juices).  OMG, PARTY in my mouth!  The rest of the party ordered the signature tacos and came with arroz gonulas and Cuban black beans.  The arroz gondulas and Cuban black beans looked so good.  Next time!  I am worried about the traffic this place gets, it is was not happen during lunch.  And I am sure it is pretty quite at nights.  Hang in there, I love your food.

For food I got the:  EDAMAME DUMPLINGS:  Daikon Radish & White Truffle Oil - I am a super fan of this.   HOUSE-MADE CHICKEN SAUSAGE PIZZA:  Tomato, Fennel & Fontina - My favie of the pizzas  Sat on the patio and love the atmosphere.  The staff was super friendly and very tentative.

I went on a Thursday night when they had the event Picket Fences and plus it was a Yelp shop local event.  Jam has so many unique gifts.  Love it!!!  Jam had a tons of people crammed into the place but it was cool because it was raining and cold outside.  The Picket Fences event was great until rain.  =(  Unfortunately, some of the vendors left before I went back outside.  I found some perfect gifts for Christmas at Jam and Boho Farm and Home has awesome jam.

I had to go back myself and pick the cupcakes myself.  It was a wonderful surprise but he did not pick the flavors that I like.  So I was working from home 1 day and decided to drop in to pick some up.  OMG, the batch I have this time is Yum-GOOD.   2 Vanillas - Good Ding Dong - Hello, happiness! Red Velvet - Choco-goodness Almond Joy - Did not get a chance to eat it (someone eat it) Peppermint Patty - Minty Choco-goodness...  I will need to stop by for some breakfast or lunch next time!

We were there a few months ago, but I forget to write a review.  Anyways, my hubby brought in his bike for a work over (new tubes, gears check, etc).  They took the bike and was done in a couple of hours.  WOW!  We thought it was going to be the next day or so before the bike was done.  They were friendly, fast, and awesome!

It was my hubby's decision to try this buffet.  They remodeled the Big Fat Greek Restaurant, ok.  My hubby has been sick after eating here.  And 4 days and counting.  =(  The only thing he tried that I would not was the clams.  Seafood at a buffet place has always been a no no in my book.    The rest of the chicken, beef, pork, etc dishes were ok.  Nothing special.  Some steaming trays were left empty, they did not refill food.    The service was outstanding (that is why 2 stars).  Try at your own risk!  Steer clear of the clams.

Met up with a bunch of sweet craving friends.  I got the health concrete mix (small).  It was good and just enough.  My order came out quick.  A couple of folks with us did not get their order until we are almost finished.  They had to bring the plastic number and receipt up to the counter.  They should not have forgotten since there was only a few people in the store.

Love, love the style and decor.  Feel like we are at a fancy club to watch movies.  LOL!   They have a full bar, food services, wait service, or can you order at the stand like the regular movies.  We booked our tickets online.  The seat were comfortable.  Plenty of places to place your drink and food.  Loved it!!!   Plus we went to watch Magic Mike...

I have to admit...I have a crush on Scott Conant.  :)  Had to convince my friend on her bday to try this place.  It was a quiet Sunday lunch.  Love the feel and comfort of the place.  We had the: 1.  CHICKEN "PARMIGIANO" served with fresh made chips:  chicken cutlet, smoked mozzarella & tomatoes on bread.  It was so tasteful with flavors and the chips just thin and cripsy.  Very good! 2.  PROSCIUTTO Pizza:  basil & tomatoes:  this sucker smelled so good when they brought it out, but the chicken parmo sandwich won, so I ate that first.  Then I attacked the pizza.  The pizza was a perfect blend of salty from the prosciutto and the sweetness of the tomatoes, and the basil just tops everything off.   3.  ASSORTMENT OF ICE CREAM SANDWICHES:  that day we got a sample of some great pairings.  See the pic...  MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....  Service was awesome, good was mouth watering, and a great kick off to my friends bday celebration (we already started on Friday)!

Dr.  Charous is worth the wait to see him.  I have serious and bad sinus issues for years.  I have already had 3 surgeries with a previous Dr., so I came here for a 2nd option.  I didn't want another surgery!  It sucks!!!  So Dr. Charous was 30 mins for our appt, but he did take his time to review my records and listen to me.  We were both on the same page of putting surgery as a last resort.  So we tried pills, breathing treatments, test, etc. for 4 months.  He was out of options, so #4 surgery was on the table again.  Did the surgery!  Recovered and moving forward with treatments to prevent my allergies from flaring up to cause my sinuses to go crazies!  So I am on drops for about a year now, and I am feel super!  I was only down with a cold since August 2012 to today 8/10/13 (Normal my colds or flu turned into walking pneumonia or bronchitis - yeah that was my 2011 & 2012) .  I have had a year of feeling like a human, no more lugging around tissue boxes.  I still have several more drop treatments, but if year #1 is so good then bring it!  I can enjoy life and be more active again.  Yes, the con is the doctors are always running later on appt time.

Came here for a work celebration for a project we have been slaving over for months.  Finally back to a normal working hours, no more 80+ hours a week.    We were in the private room in the back.  We had champagne and apps already out for us. We had a set list of items to order from.  I got the turkey pastrami.  YUM!  Pretzel bread anything is good.  Blueberry cheesecake is to die for!   The service was good considering we had 25+ of us.  I did had to ask a few times for refills.

I came here for a Saturday night dinner with V and L.  V and I had a hard time locating the place.  We drove around the corner not knowing the place was inside the plaza so you can't see if from the parking lot.  HA!    We loved the feel to the place.  It is small but just cute!  The server was totally helpful and funny.  We ordered: La Classique Tartes Flambees - crème fraîche, onions, bacon, cheese:  YUM!  Notre-dame Wood Oven Pizza - prosciutto, mozzarella, tomatoes, onions,  crème fraîche, pesto:  Pretty good!  Chicken, Bacon, Mozzarella Pizza: WHOA, greatness!!!  Dessert: Crêpe hot chocolate:  NEED TO GET Crème brulee chocolate flavored:  GOODNESS Crêpe nutella:  Was good, but the hot chocolate kicked butt!!!

Parking sucked, but I parked across the street.  I know we here in AZ are spoiled.  We park right by the place we go.  lol!  Finally got to try Windsor, about time!  The staff was super friendly.  I got the: 1.  Cheddar Fondue:  Warm MJ pretzel, apple slices & sausage - Eat this when the cheddar is melty.  It is a very tasty appetizer.   2.  Buttermilk Fried Chicken:  The king of fried chicken & your favorite side - This is the on the block special for Monday and Tuesday's only.  Chicken was very good, crispy, moist on the inside, and good coat on the chicken.  The mac and cheese side was pretty good.    Too full, could not handle dessert.

My mom picked this place for her birthday lunch.  We drove 50 mins (1 way).  It was a little place stuck in a strip mall.  We were greeted right away.  The staff was super friendly.  Before we ordered, the server brought waters and these yellow soups.  I have never seen yellow soup before, so like a little kid, MOM - What is this???  She told me it was a corn congee-like soup.  It was tasteless but then I found it you put sugar it in.  Ah, I just I am a Northern Style Chinese food newbie.  Since I have no idea, I left it up to my parents to order the food.    Beef Pies - Excellent!!!  Very tasty and yummy. Pork Potstickers -  Freshly made and cooked.  These are very good.  But found out Northern style, you do not use soy sauce for dipping sauce.  Vinegar is the thing. Green Onion Pancakes -  It was fresh but the layers of dough were not there.  OK. Fried Beef Bun - These are actually steamed.  Doughy but good. Lamb Skewers - My family inhaled them.  And said it was great.   Spicy Pork Intestines Stir Fry - Again my family ate it and said it was good.  I am the only person in my family that is not that brave.    1 con:  It was super HOT!  I was sweating the entire lunch.  Please turn on the AC!

Shared a nice outside brunch with a friend on Sunday.  I love the feel of the place (clean and cozy).  The food was very delicious too!  Service was on the slower side. I ordered the Breakfast Panini:  egg, applewood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, arugula and roasted tomato.  The sandwich was pressed nice and crispy.  I added breakfast potatoes (some of the bigger chunks were not completely cooked yet).     I give it overall a 3.5.  I would love to come back to try the other items on the menu.

I had a wonderful time at the concert.  I love her musical talent and the range of her voice.  The part that got me crying like a crazy women, she mentions her late husband and shows pics of the family.  And many of her songs were love songs, so here I am looking for tissue because I can't see anymore with all the tears.  Her voice is incredible.  She sounds just like she did in the back in the days.  Now the Titanic song was spectacular, her voice, the band, and the stage show.  I had a great time!

Went to Airworx for a birthday, ok kid birthday part.  It was so much fun.    Airworx is very organized, sign in here, put gifts here, put shoes here, you are in this room, etc.  We had the pink room (as our dedicated room).  Love the bright and fun colors.  Our host at Airworx was awesome.  She was attentive,outgoing, and made sure the kids and adults were comfortable and had enough food.  I jumped in the long trampoline side, raced a mom to climb up the side, played dodge ball and had a blast!  Loved that they had a set time to set up 2 dodge balls games for our entire group (I think 30 to 35 of us)?  I can not believe a 6 year old tagged me OUT!  REALLY???  Those little people are evil, J/K!

Naked pizza?  WTF is that?  That is what I thought!  Naked pizza = all natural pizza.  The crust is made of 10 grains plus prebiotic agave fiber and probiotics.  Let's just say, the crust is GOOD and good for you.    The storefront is just counter, soda case, and order your pizza.  The menu is on the wall.  It is modern and super clean.  No tables to sit and eat inside but there are a few small tables and chairs outside.    I ordered the 14" classic with pepperoni.  The crust was so good, the cheese (is that what natural real cheese taste like?), and pepperoni (pretty good).  The price is not bad for an all natural pizza that is good for you.

I have not had frozen yogurt after McD's replaced soft serve ice cream with frozen yogurt.  OK, so a freaking long time.  So, I was a little bit not sure when our group wanted frozen yogurt.  I saw all the choices for frozen yogurt and starting to imagine the possibilities and then I saw all the toppings.  OMG!    Got the oatmeal cookie and vanilla frozen yogurt.  Toppings - mochi mini-balls, snow caps & dark chocolate chips.  Love it!  The oatmeal cookie was SO SO GOOD.    There are over a dozen selection of frozen yogurt and over 70 toppings.  WOW!  Everything is clean and fresh.  I am hooked now.

I always love their pizza!  YUM!  Of course that is what I got.  But my friends said, we ordered some wings too.  Cool!  OMG, they are so good but since I am a wimp it was a little spicy for me.    Yes, I know the decor is the usually Oregano's theme.  What give it the 5 stars?  The service!  Our server ROCKED!  She even offered to give us a togo cup of our drinks to take with us or get us fresh ones to take.  SWEET!

My husband bought a Arizona Wellness massage package from work as a just because gift.  Sometimes he gets it right.  =)    I get three 30 mins massages or upgrade to a 60 mins for only $20 & 3 more massages at 50% off.  What the heck!  I will try a 30 min to see if the place is ok.  It is a chiropractor office.  They have a split layout (chiropractor and massages patience).  You walk in, check in, and then they call you.  The massage therapist came and introduced herself.  The you know the usually questions, and disrobe!  The massage was pretty good.

This time I am review the doctors.  I tweaked my back BIG time.  I called and they accept my insurance and had an apt in the afternoon.  SWEET!  I went on a Thursday and Saturday to see Dr. Miller.  She sat and listened to me.  Asked questions.  Exam me thoroughly to find the root cause of the pain.  I am lucky, she said my back muscles were ANGRY!  LOL!  I got the massaging machine and heating pad.  10 mins of bless.  I could have slept there.  Then she adjustment me.  After the 2nd visit, I was 50% better.  Then the 3rd visit I got the main Dr. there.  He did the same thing.  Listen and talk to me and adjusted my whole body.  I feel 75% better today!!!  Can't wait to I can dance again.  LOL!  Super nice and friend staff.

The "professional" scary people were very very believable. They were all mingling amongst the Yelpers during the event. Totally in the characters.   The sneak peak to Monsterland was awesome. The place is based on movie themes: Jack the Ripper, Werewolves, etc.. Very well put together. The automatic spooky pop up were very detailed. The details are so realistic that we were not sure who was real or fake. It is going to jump or touch me? And that is only from the first level sneak peak. I can't imagine the basement or dungeon as they called it.

There are so many kinds of wines to pick from.  I was wandering up and down the aisles looking for my MIL's favorite wine.  To my surprise they did not carry it.  Then I went home to research doesn't seem they make this kind anymore?  Anyways, they have super helpful employees.  He suggested a sweet white wine.  I hope she likes it!!!

Every year for my bday present to myself, I book a spa day!!  I was looking on Yelp in my zip code under spa and this new place popped up.  Hum...what the hey, I will try it.      I looked online and they have everything under the sun.  That is cool!  I booked the sunset package (classic mani & pedi and hydrator facial) and added a 60 min swedish massage.    Place is clean and modern with changing rooms, lockers, showers, etc.  I was greeted as soon as I walked in.  And the nice gentleman offered me coffee, tea, water, etc.  I declined I just drank a ton of water.  CC greeted me for my main/pedi treatment.  She is sweet, nice, and gentle with all my digits.  =)  She introduced me to this product called Shellac for my nails.  I don't like fake nails, I just want polish to last longer on my natural nails.  OMG, this stuff is for real.  It last longer and dries instantly.  So far, I came home & have been doing chores and they look fantastic!    I was offered a drink again, I selected Ice Tea.  YUM!  Next was my facial with Adam.  The coconut products he used was awesome and they smelled so good.  I was craving nutty coconut ice cream!!  =)  He is so awesome.  His shoulder massage was great!!  I was melting like butter.  My last treatment was the swedish massage.  It was ok.  I would definitely be back to see CC and Adam!!!  I think I found my new spa spot.

The place looks like a fast food joint, but it is not.  They are a sit down service.  Cool!  We had a party of 20ppl.  We filled up half the place.  They have tons of choices of sushi and regular COOKED food.  I ordered the:  1.  Agedashi Tofu - Perfectly and lighted fried tofu with soy sauce:  YUM GOOD 2.  Gyoza - Fried and they are ok 3.  Teriyaki Chicken - The sauce was not too sweet - Not bad  The service was pretty good to keep up with 20 of us!

Came here for HH.  Sat in the middle of the room.  Can't get a server's attention to save your life!  If you flag another server, that server will try to find your server and you sit and wait.

Ok.  I am hooked on this place.  First I was like WHAT?  Eat at a smoothie place.  They serve FOOD?  The flatbreads looked so good.  I ordered the chicken pesto flatbread.  The flatbread is soft and grilled to be slight crispy at the edges.  And chicken, parmesan cheese, and pesto was super flavorful.  I had to get it again the next week.  he he he...  I got the Hawaiian Breeze smoothie the first time.  SO GOOD.  I had to try other flavors... This time I got the Kiwi Quencher smoothie.  YUM.  Keep in mind the smoothies are lowfat!

I loved the Carlos O'Brien in Phx.  I thought it would be the same.  NOT!  The place is nice and new.  Service was ok.  Food was just flat not good.  Got combo #15, chicken chimy with queso, rice & beans.  Bland, bland, bland...    My hubby got their one of their specials (2) corn beef taco.  OMG, the total for 2 tacos was $18.04 (no price was posted on their special list on the table).  Since it is a St. Patrick's Day special, we thought $5 to $6.  He said he did not like them at all.  The shells had a weird taste and the corn beef was not flavorful at all.    Lesson learned:  Always ask for pricing if not listed!

OK.  Loved this place!  Decor, food, and service!  Started with the tomato bruschetta (house made ricotta, campari tomato, basil, & tomato jam).  It was good.  Then the server suggested the SHORT RIB RADIATORI (parmesan cream, fresh horseradish, wilted arugula, and herbed breadcrumb).  This is one of my favie pasta dish EVER!  The short rib was so flavor and just melts in your mouth.  The past looks like radiator... (hint the name of the dish).  LOL!!!  To top off the night, I got the DARK CHOCOLATE TART (nutella mousse, pecan toffee).  Talk about a foodgasm...  OH YEAH!

We came here for a birthday party!  It was so much FUN!  The waiting area is open and clean.  There is a bar to get some happy on before the movie.  In the movie theater itself, they have three (maybe four) rows or tables counters with office chairs or the individual seats with sliding tables.  The birthday girl and her friends out the comfy individual seats, so us folks got the table counters with office chairs.  The office chairs were not that comfortable (and reminds me of work).    The movie and sound quality was the same as any other movie place.  The food was yummy!  I got the coconut panko chicken tenders with fries.  You get 6 pieces of chicken not 3 or 4 and plenty of fries.  Service was great.  Those office chair comfort - minor 1 star.

M and I came here for a Sunday brunch to get caught up with the latest and greatest.  We opted to sit in the patio.  It was a nice and warm day.  The patio is doggy friendly!!!   That is cool.  I would love to bring my dogs, but I think I will eat the other (small) dogs for brunch.  =)    They have a great brunch menu but I opted for the Grilled Chicken Pie flatbread (it was calling my name) and a side of french fries.  M ordered the biscuits & beer gravy for $10 includes your choice of a 10oz AZ beer.  The flatbread was so good.  Flavorful, light thin bread, and baked to perfection.  M's biscuits and beer gravy was very good too.  Why 4 stars?  The service was good but slow.

Got mixed reviews on Yelp, but I wanted to try it for myself.  It is new and it is close by.  So it was a Saturday night and around 7pm, they were busy but not PACKED.  They didn't do much in re-decorating from the previous place...  Just more Caballero stuff.  We were greeted and sat right away. Our seats were a little dirty, we had to ask for the hostess to wipe it down.  Then we sat next to the door that is for the patio.  It open and closed as people wondering out to smoke all visit long. =(    Food wise...We ordered: Manny's empanada's (description: honoring manny and his mom's recipe + $1 from each order goes to the manuel scholarhip):  What the hell?  You get to eat food and donate.  YEAH.  The empanadas were ok but they are SPICY!  No where on the menu said they are HOT.  My lips were on FIRE! French Dip:  The sandwich was good and the bread was perfect.  The fries were soggy.  =(   Mac and cheese:  just plan NOT good.  Ek!  The service was good, just the food and the experience did not pan out.  Bummer!

If it is wasn't for the haboob, the girls that came to visit sickie me would have eaten in the East side.  They stayed on the West side and we decided to go to Chef Ben's because a friend's daughter works there and it is her first job.  Us Aunts wanted to say hello and give her a hard time.  he he he!    It was cute & clean place.  They have a mix of Japanese and Chinese food.  I ordered the double chicken (panko & grilled) with teriyaki!  The teriyaki was sweeter than I like but it was good.  The service staff was good.  The prices are reasonable.  I would come back to visit again!

Came here to grab lunch.  OMG, the line was wrapped clear around the place into the dinning area.  Kinda of crazy, but the line moves fast.  I ordered my usual, chicken burrito but togo.    The chicken was a little more spicier than normal, but it was good.    Cons:  parking sucks and getting out of the plaza sucks.

Got a pedicure with my gfs.  It is clean, the ladies are professional, and many colors to choose from.  Since there was 4 of us, we called ahead for a reservation.  Love it there.  Surprised me that they do a complimentary shoulder rub while you wait for your pedicure to dry.  NICE!

Caroline mentioned to check out her website too (www.BohoFarmandHome.com).  She participates at different events.  She offers tours by appointment only:  info@bohofarmandhome.com.

At the Arrowhead Mall, I walked in and was greeted right away.  I knew exactly what I wanted.  1/2 pound of Gyokuro Genaicha Green Tea (basically green tea with roasted brown rice).  One of my favorites!!!  Don't steep too long (30 to 45 seconds) ONLY!

Came here to meet M for brunch.  Get there early, the cafe is packed by 9:30am on the weekends.  I ordered the:  Two eggs any style - scrambled eggs (super fluffy - heart it), potatoes, ham, and sour dough toast.  Everything was so good!  Stuffed pancake original - yummy yummy for my tummy tummy.  Super terrific!  Fluffy, tasteful, & cooked to perfection!  The green tea was very good too!  The service was good.  1 minor con:  The chairs are a little uncomfortable.

The employees are very friendly.  The store is small but a little dirty.  I was very disappointed that the sandwich was super thin:  3 maybe 4 thin slices of meat and 2 slices of cheese.  And it was bland.  I could have made that sandwich in my kitchen with cold cuts.  So not worth it!

We got drive thur only.  I did get a peak of the restaurant inside, it is the same set up as all the other Culver's.  I got the Wisconsin Swiss Melt with chili cheese fries & a vanilla shake.  YUM!  I know it is a butter burger, but just wish it was a tad less greasy.  I KNOW, I am at a fast food joint.  The vanilla frozen custard shake is goodness and the chili cheese fries were pretty good.  Their menu looks massive from the outside looking in, the drive thur menu I don't think captures it all.  I guess we need to stop in sometime soon.

It is all Nora V.'s fault that I had to come order from this place!  =)  So after shopping at Target, I had to come get my Asian on!  LOL!  I walked in and placed an order to go: 1.  BBQ Pork - This is from the apps selection:  the bbq sauce to too sweet for my liking 2.  Sesame Chicken - I liked their version, but the chicken could be crispier but then again I got it togo so it was steaming in the container 3.  Beef Chow Fun - This is a good flavorful dish but the chow fun was made with thin flat noodles not the normal flat wide noodles.  Either way, it is was good.

It was my first time to a Cafe Zupas.  My friend wanted to come because of the chocolate covered strawberry.  I was not that hungry so I got the Chicken Enchilada Chili soup.  Made with red & green enchilada sauces, delicious chunks of chicken, black beans, & fresh southwestern veggies.  It came with a chuck of bread and the chocolate covered strawberry.  It is kinda like a paradise bakery.  The soup was good.  The drinks are with a twist.  They have the regular coke soda foundation, but they have these syrups on the side to make your OWN flavored drink.  Everything was good!!!  Need to try a sandwich next time.

Thanks Yelp for luring me to donuts!  I got a ham and cheese croissant plus 4 donuts (buttermilk, vanilla cake, glazed, and bavarian filled).  The young lady in the front was so sweet and helpful.  All the donuts were so good, light, and fluffy.  The croissant was very good too!  I need to go back to try the boboa drinks.  I can only handle so much sweetness at once!

Ate alone since I was running errands.  Quick, fast, and good!  I was HUNGRY, almost turning HANGRY!  I got the pick 2 -ham and cheese with mac & cheese plus a cookie and I added a soup, chicken wild rice.  Everything was tasty and I inhaled every bit all of all the food and gulped down my green ice teas (2 large cups).  One minor con, many of the tables were not cleaned so you had find a clean one.

WOW!  Smells great in there.  Prices are reasonable.  TONS of flavors.  It is too hot to buy the chocolate covered ones.  It wouldn't last 5 mins in the cars and we have not started shopping yet.  I got the white cheddar for me.  Beer cheddar for my hubby.  Yum!

The staff is very helpful.  We opted to order cupcakes in a jar for my hubby's birthday.  Cupcakes in a jar = 2 cupcakes and around $6 each.    We got pink champagne, cookie monster, and custom made chocolate cheesecake flavors.  YUM!    The store smells fantastic when you walk in.  Need to go try more flavors!!!

My husband loved this place so much, he went twice in 1 day.  He went there for lunch.  When I got home from work and said I was too tired to cook, he offered to pick up food for dinner.    I got the combo dinner (gyro and chicken).  I am a fan of the chicken, hummus, and pita.  The gyro meat....NOT so much.  I am never a fan of the gyro always.

The place is nice and shiny.  We were seated quickly and then waited for 15 mins before we got our drink orders.  The service was slow for lunch.  Had to ask for refills a few times.  Fried Mozzarella:  flash fried, house-made mozzarella, with tomato dipping sauce.  These things are super crispy and good.  Steak & Turkey Chili:  black & white beans, tomato, onion, spices, sour cream. The server said it was not spicy but YES it was.  And it didn't taste good.    Meat Lovers Pizza:  OK, pizza was awesome.  It get a little soggy 1/2 way through the pizza.

Cute, bright, and a clean place!  Too hot to sit in the patio, so M and I selected to sit inside.  The place got busier and busier as it got closer to noon.  I ordered breakfast because I never wake up early enough to eat it.  LOL!!!  The meat and cheese omelete, toast, potatoes, etc. were all so good.  The service was great.  I loved the green ice tea....  LOVE it.  The server even gave me a cup to go....  SWEET!

Nice weather, we gotta sit outdoors!  My friends are already here and waiting.  The server must have been looking out, she came out to greet the new people.  She took our drink orders quick.  The menu looks the same as Picazzo's.  I get my usual, 2 slice of pepperoni.  The pizza is good, thin crust, a little soggier than I would like it.  This place is a good alternative for one of my friend that has a gluten allergy.

Unique concept!  I really like it by the layout is a little confusing.  PIng pong tables, picnic tables, reserved areas, bar area, free for all areas, and just a cluster.    You must valet or good luck and find a place to park within a 1 mile of this place.  We got our names on the list for a 45 min wait.  Straight to the bar!  Hardly a spot to get to the bar to order.  One of us got to the bar and ordered for everyone.  Grab our drinks and found a free for all area to crash.  Ordered the soft pretzels & provolone fondue app.  SO SO SO SO GOOD.  It was very loud too.  Almost felt like I needed to text my friends to communicate with them.    Finally got in for the table.  It was right next the kitchen.  Awesome!  But within 10 mins of sitting at the table the live band started to play.  They were good but SO LOUD.  Impossible to carry a conversation at all.  I ordered the fried chicken (3 pieces of perfectly fried chicken with honey lightly drizzled on top, a freaking awesome biscuit, and a tiny scope of mash potatoes.  But the servers were great!  Boiled down to:  FOOD 5 stars; concept 5 star; & 1 stars for enjoying the company of your fellow eaters.  Felt like I ordered food and was like eating by myself at a concert.  WHAT?  HOW IS YOUR FOOD?  WHAT?  Our conversions!

This is my first time to get pizza from Little Caesars.  My husband wanted to their pizza.  I think he wanted to re-live so childhood or something.  LOL!!  I ordered a large supreme and 3 meats pizza.  Then I ordered 2 orders of garlic and parm chicken wings and 1 order of the lemon pepper wings.  So the cashier rung me up and $34+.  I handed him the debt card and he said, oh we can only take cash our machines are not working.  Really, he could have told me before I ordered.  I had to walk next door to Fresh & Easy to buy something so I can get cash back.  =(    The pizza and chicken wings were ok.  I wouldn't get them again.

When you get here it is... Decisions, decisions, decisions....  What size to get, what flavor to get, what toppings to get, and then what sauce to get....  They ALL sound so good....    After standing in line for 5 mins and staring at the menu (with my glasses on), OH CRAP it is my turn...  Small, Thai tea, mochi balls with condensed milk sauce came out of my mouth.    I waited less than 5 mins and they called me name for picking up.  It looks so yummy!!!  It was really good!  It was icier than I expected.  I thought it would be creamy.  But it is called Snoh!  It is a fun, happening place.  L, G, and I plus a few friends ran into Nader there!!  Nice to see where all the Yelpers flock to new places!

Second time here, I sat in the dining area last time and the band was so loud that I could not communicate with my dinning mates.  So we choose outside this time, it was on Halloween so it was cool to see all the costumes and everyone in the Halloween spirit.  But again the music was loud, we were screaming at each other to communicate.  I love the trend, relaxing feel.  The food is so good:  had the fried chicken (YUM).  This time I got the beef dip.  HELLO, it was shaved prime rib with au jus sauce and yummy fries.  Very moist and taste awesome.  The server was funny and very attentive.

Ok, I think I am going to be booed for this.  Yes, 2 stars!  I have heard so much great things about their food at the Tempe location.  Bummed when I finally had time they closed and was moving to the Mesa location.  So when L said they are open NOW, lets go I was drooling...  =)    The Mesa location is new, nice, and clean.  It was pretty roomy too.  Got there at 6:20pm, we had a reservation for 6 to 7 people at 6:30pm.  They tired to give us a table for 4, so we had to stress that we have 6 to 7 people.  They sat us in a corner table but it was only for 5.  We had to ask for 2 more chairs twice.  Service was very slow (snail speed).  Our other 3 people finally joined us around 6:40 and then 6:45pm.  We ordered drinks and app.  We got the poutine (french fries covered in cheese curds and gravy) not on the menu.  The drinks and the app came out quick.  Yum!  We munched and then she came back to take our order around 7:05pm.  She told us that the kitchen was backed up and was going to put our ticket in in 5 mins so all the dishes would come out together and hot.    Ok.  fast foward to 7:50pm.  The app was licked clean, drinks are empty, and we are straving.  After watching a few tables that came after us eat and left, we were feeling like did they lose our ticket?  We flagged the another server down to check because we have not see our server for the last 20 mins or more.  She told us our ticket is 4th  in line, but she couldn't tell us how much longer.  How did our ticket get push that far back?  Especially watch people that came after us get food.  The owner, she was making her rounds with the tables.  She came to ours and thought we were finished.  Oh NO, we have not received our food yet.  We told her we have been waiting for almost 1 hour.  I have proof, I have been bored and I was taking pictures and the time is stamped on them.  The owner came back from the kitchen with the POS receipt and said we didn't put in our order until 7:28pm.  OH NO, we gave our order to the server a little after 7pm, if she choose to sit on it for over 20 mins that is not my problem.  YOU JOKING?  The serve came back and told us I told you I was going to put your order in after 10 mins.  Oh no, you said 5 min.  Either way, ordered at 7:05 + 10 mins = 7:15pm not 7:28pm.  They blamed that it was that we were waiting for people.  So how in the heck did you get their orders if they were not here yet?  WHAT?  OK, now I am hungry and pissed.  It is 8;05pm now.  My butt can tell me how long I have been sitting.    At 8:19pm the food FINALLY got here.  And guess what?  Some of the orders were wrong; most of the food was on a cold plate with luke warm food; and then a food runner showed up with an extra plate of food.  OMG, what a cluster fxck!  We were scope sides of other's plates and trading food until we assembled something close to what we ordered.    We were finished eating and then the wait for the bills.  We all had our wallets out and were ready.  She dropped off the bills and we asked her for a box togo.  Nothing.  Then she came back to pick up the money & bills.  Took another 10 mins before the change is coming back.  Then the wait for the togo box starts.  We finally left at 9:05pm.  I am grouchy and my butt hurts from sitting so long (extra grouchy now).  I hate to give family establishments a bad review but my first expirence was just horrible!!!!  Maybe it was just a 1-off incident?

I know this is a burger joint, but their french fries are AWESOME!  I ordered the bacon cheese burger (I should have ordered the light - 1 patty instead of 2).  It was too much for me.  I again should have ordered the small fries not the normal size.  The soda machines are fun.  I had orange vanilla HC drink.  YUM...  I wanted to look through the machine to see what other options but I had someone behind me.    Minus -1 star:  The seat hurt my butt or I need more meat on my butt.  LOL!

This place is fun and has all sorts of goodies.  And candy that I have not seen in a LONG time.  The only thing that I did not like was this rude freaking snobby kids.  Hate freaking rude pre-teen little shxts.  The staff was awesome.

The place is inviting but LOUD!  The blenders, tv, people, etc.  WHAT did you say?  LOL!  I got a almond milk tea with boba.  The tea and boba was good.  This place ofters more than milk teas.  Froyo, appetizers food snacks, and other blended drinks.

You know it is the usual set up.  Tried the pumpkin chocolate chip muffin, WHOA!  It was very good.  I also got the 1/2 soup and sandwich thing (baked potato soup and ham/cheese).  It was good as normal.

This review is 4-1/2 stars.  Our server, Justin is AWESOME!!!!!  He made the visit a blast and a fellow server that chimed in here and there.  =)  Even the food runner had fun conversations with us.  I was on the my way home, then I get a text.  HH?  On a Friday night, after being locked in a room for 9 hours to work a project.  HELL to the yes (borrowing from Glee).  I walked in and found L & M all happy from HH specials.  The table was 3/4 full of food and drinks.  I had to join in on ordering food....  CATFISH BEIGNETS:  My favies!  Fried light and spices just right.  CAST-IRON SKILLET DUMPLINGS:  chcken and shrimp filled, the skillet get the dumpling skin to have that pan fried crispiness.    FLAT TOP GRILLED QUESADILLA:  Quesadilla - Nothing special  CHILE PORK TOSTADAS:  These are yummy.  Each clumpy of yummy pork on their crispy tostadas.   BLACKENED CATFISH TACOS:  It was more a roll than a taco.  It was ok.    NACHOS with Cheesy Something - ?  YUMMY!  Nachos and yummy melted cheese dip.

It was nicely decorated and clean.  They do have many things to pick from but most of the food was dry.  The wonton soup was never refill the entire time we were there.  The sweets were very sad.

#1 - It is MJ music #2 - Our seats got upgrade  Performers were great.  A lot of dancing, I loved it!  Mix of acrobatics with some MJ dance moves mixed in.  The special effect were cool.  Ok, really cool!  The story line is what confused me.  LOL!  I was like WHAT?  Any who the music was good, I got up to shake it a little.  :)

The coconut slushie with boboa so so SO good on a HOT day.  OK, any day.  It is so freaking warm in the store when you wait for your drink, sorry I needed to list that is a con.  And they need to come out behind the counter sometimes to wipe down the sticky tables and chairs.  But the staff is very friendly!

Came there on a Saturday afternoon, yes for breakfast after a spa treatment.  The wait was 20 mins, GAME!  I heard it can be up to 1 hour (yikes).  So 10 mins in, they text me - Table is ready.  Woot woot!  Love the atmosphere.  Cool tables, chairs, and decor.  I got seated in the back of the place, nice.  I got a green hot tea.  They give you the full on leaves and everything (you know it is pretty good tea).  I got the Breakfast Pot Pie, it was ok.  It was a little bland, needed to add a tab of salt.  I had to get the chocolate chip pancake as a side.  YUM!  The service was great too!  Hash browns could have been a bit crispier.

We ordered the Bun Tha Nun, Tha Nun with rice, and fried egg rolls.  The food was mediocre but the service was AWFUL!  The young female staff does speak or acknowledge you at all.  I asked her a few times and she just stares at you & leave.  The prego lady staff is just rude.  And male staff was slow and unhelpful.  To top it off my mom and I both got really bad stomach craps the next day and it last 2 days.  I think we had food poisoning.

I am finally out of my food coma from Monday.  LOL!!   Wow, this was the place to be.  LGO has yummy everything!  Gelato samples to kick off the sugar coma.  I had apple pastry, mini cupcake, and mini brownie.  I had to stop!!  I was getting dizzy from the sugar...  =)  The muffins smelled so good, but I needed to save room from pizza from next door.  Still in my sugar coma, we got goodie bags with more sweets...  Kudos to Lindsey, Yelp, and LGO.    Minus 1 star due to the amount of people cramped into a small space.  =(

Jose got great reviews from my brother and his girlfriend.  Jose has worked on both of their landscapes.  And I saw all the good reviews on Yelp too.    I called and Jose came over to review my "jungle" backyard and crazy front yard.   He gave me an estimate and it was very reasonable.  I am very pleased with the front/back yard.  I didn't ask him to spray weed killer but he did anyways.  And since it was slightly raining that day, he said to call him in two weeks and he can come back to spray again.    I recommend C&A Landscapes for any work that needs to be done!!!  Very professional and honest!

This place is so cute and love that they use chinese take containers for bowls.  Cute idea and the fortune cookie just sells the cutie concept.  Order the plain jane vanilla.  The staff explained that all the ingredients are local and made in house.  I could not wait to try it.  It was good, but way too sweet for my taste buds.  I heart local businesses so I need to come back to try another flavor.

Loved the employees of this store.  I told them I need to get 2 drinks with the hospital, with food, and 2 bags, so they put my drinks in to a carrier and sealed my hot drink with green plug so it does not spill.  SWEET!!!

I was late to our happy hour.  Had to run home to let the fuzzy kids go outside before I could sneak out for HH.  :)  The parking lot has tons of cars, but I was lucky to get a spot right in front of the place.  It is a little place and cute.  The service was just SUPER slow.    Ordered the Porco e Funghi was pretty good.  The crust was crispy but some of the crust was soggy when to get to the last few slices.

I truly liked it here....  The staff was super friendly and attentive.  It was hopping and popping when I got there.  I knew my friend got a table, but I just could not see her at all.  Then one of the managers ask if I needed help, I guess I looked lost.  I was like I am looking for my friend, she already has been sat.  He pointed to a table next over and DUH.  Yeah, she was right there.  I guess I should get my eyes checked.  Anyway, as soon as I sat down the server came to ask what I would like to drink.  Got a green ice tea.  L ordered so some appetizers came in within 5 mins I was there.  Sweet.  G was still on her way.  I ordered more appetizers off the happy hours menu...  We got:  (2)SMOKED CHICKEN WINGS - Nicely cooked with juices and just delicious (2)ROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUTS - Surprising very tasty and GOOD (1)SAUSAGE, PRETZEL and CHEESE - It was good (1)PICKLED PORK TEMPLE - Looks great, but  was too stuffed to try  Love the vibe but looking for a parking spot can be tricky.

We were there on a Saturday late afternoon.  Including us, there were only 6 customers.  The service was pretty quick (3 different servers), they all helped out each other.    Ok, here is the food comments:    Thai Satay Chicken Skewers - they were dry, tough, and not grilled (I think it was fried).  The peanut sauce that they were covered in was not peanutty enough.    BBQ Pork Slices - the flavor was good and a little greasy, but the slices were inconsistent.  You get super thin slices and they normal slices.  Beef Egg Foo Young - The beef and gravy was ok but the veggie egg platters a little on the burnt side.    We overhead the couple on the other side of us complain about their food.  So, I am not sure if it was an off day or this was their normal quality of food.  I would good back to Ono Hawaiian (fast food) which is cross the parking lot next time I feel Asian.

YUM...  My first time here!  I loved it.  I got the French scrambled eggs with sausage and baguette.  Everything was GOOD!  The green ice tea was good and better cold.   The ice machine was out of ice.  It took them about 15 to 20 mins to get more ice into the machine.  The chocolate croissant was super good.  Got 4 macaroons and I inhaled them at home.  YUM.........................

I came here with 5 of my friends and family.  We had so much fun!  Van Gogh's Starry Night was the challenge.    2 of the people from our group has done this painting thing before.  The rest of us...we are newbies.  It was easy to follow instructions to get paints.  Lots of space to work and move around.  Loved it!

I hate to give 1 star but I just couldn't even like the place.  I was so disappointed by the service and food.  The server did not know the menu or how to make drinks.  1.  Ice coffee:  first cup of coffee:  salt was in the sugar container.  second time:  lots of coffee grinds in the cup.  third time:  the coffee was watered down.   2.  They were out of spinach, out of croissants, & the eggs were under cooked. 3.  Lorriane quiche was bland and super small  We got the last chocolate croissant.  That was the best from the whole experience.  I hope it was an off day, but I am going to pass and try another place before coming back.

24/7 - YES they are!  They were so cool there.  They HELLOed you when you walked in.  Happy as can be people!   Lots of place to sit and chill.  One con... they are not part of Starbuck's corp so you free refill does not work here.  You need to pay $0.50 since they are part of the Caesar corp.

The place was clean and can handle larger parties.  The services was great.  The pork and chive dumplings were good.  We got many of the steamed eggs on the house.  It was good too!  We had the Korean Style omlet, that was good too!  I ordered the chicken bulgogi was OK.  It was not tasty as the beef bulgogi.

Came here for lunch.  It was a nice environment.  They serve good comfort good that you are use to.  I had the chicken fried chicken, huge portions and tasted great.  The chicken did not loose it's crispy after smothered by the country sauce.  Mash potatoes and the corn on the cob was great too.   The server was good but we had to ask for new silverware due to they were dirty.

I have had Sweet Republic ice cream at Sprouts before.  It was GREAT.  Then after dinner L and G wanted some sweets.  So of course we used Yelp!  OH, Sweet Republic is right down the street.  OH we are so going....  I got a scoop of the roasted almond crunch and coconut in a waffle cone.  I have to say.....Absolu-Fxcking-tely awesome ice cream.  I LOVED the roasted almond crunch.  We were there enjoying the ice cream while they had a steady stream of people coming in.  Come in and support your local businesses.

Cute small place.  We had 8 of us thank goodness we had a reservation but the food took so long:  From appetizers to our actually meals. They forgot a lot.  Our drinks were also empty.  The servers are hit and miss:  1 server was helpful and 1 server was not happy to be there.  It was like we were bothering her.

I have been to this place several times.  Never remembering to take pics or check in.  What is wrong with me?  :)  I got my go to drink, Almond milk tea.  No bobas this time.  It was good but still on the sweet side.  I asked for 1/2 the sweetness, so not sure if I got that or not.  I don't think I did.  I need to come back to try the food.  Looks and smells good!

I am a fan of OHSO.  I have to brunch at the Indian School locations.  LOVE IT!  I was in North Scottsdale meeting up with a friend, we decided to have OHSO.  And I was craving a burger.  It is smaller than the IS location.  We were greeted and sat between inside and outside of the place.  Felt a little on display.  I order the Burger + Cheese with fries.  It was so good.  The service was average.  I had to ask for refills.

They have patience and they are very knowledgeable of the product.  I got three flavors:  coconut, roasted almond, and chocolate with hazelnut....  The gelato is perfect, not too sweet and packed with flavors.  We were sitting outside and the staff would come out with cups of ice water.  She came out x2 when were we there.  SO nice.  Remember to tip these guys!!!

I had Rudy's in New Mexico and it was so good.  Then they opened one up in Chandler, and I was excited!  I was super excited that a Rudy's was opening on the West side. No more driving 40 mins to get BBQ.  Like always, I love the moist brisket and the baby back ribs.  The corn on the cob was so sweet and good.  I like the Sissy BBQ sauce.  Yes, I am a wimp.

TOTAL FAN!!!  It is a hidden gem.  Love the vibe, food, and staff!  Got angry orchard, the basic, and the lemon chicken soup.  Just recently discovered my love for hard ciders.... YUM!  The basic is the mother of all grilled cheese sandwiches (melted cheese top - what, what?).  The soup of the day was lemon chicken with rice, so GOOD not too sour.  Loved it, inhaled in!  Also got the side of the pesto potato salad (come there just to try it), it was a little disappointing since the hyped was all there.  it needed more pesto in the flavor but it was good.

Came here for my brother's bday breakfast!  It was a slight wait for a table of 5.  They got us a table right by the door.  So it was a bit cold every time the door was open.  The service was awesome...  Food was good....  1.  Chocolate pancakes - HELLO!!!!  It is slightly crispy and way to yummy! 2.  Ham & Cheese Omelette - My brother said YOU NEED TO TRY IT (apple gouda chicken sausage) so I added to my omelette.  I have to say, yeah it was great but the omelette itself was ok.  I need to come back to try other items.

I hate to give low reviews for mom and pop shops.  But the service was terrible!!!  Ok, there was 8 of us for dinner.  We ordered a crap load of food.  Each dish came with no spoons or extra pair of chopsticks, so we can share.  We asked a few times for spoons each dish.  UGH!  When we were ordering the young server either seemed she was disinterested or not getting it.  We even had folks at our table that spoke Chinese.  COME on MAN!  Had to ask for enough waters and check on our drinks.  Review my pics, we ordered green onion pancakes, dumplings, soup dumplings, stir fried rice cakes, braised beef, spicy noodle soups, clear noodles, cold chicken, etc.  They ran out of the steamed fried dumplings.    The best tasting dish was the shanghai stir fried rice cake noodles.  The worse was the deep fried dumplings.

They were swamped with people coming in and out of the store.  But we waited in line for help to check my battery.  We got Robert.  He was SO nice!!!  He came out and checked my DEAD battery.  Recommend that I get a new one.  Showed me the liquid vs gel ones. etc.  He helped me remove the old one install the new one too.  I was off and on my way.  Super friendly customer service and got a battery for my car.  :)  3 year warranty!

Had lunch here with V.  When we walked in they asked if we wanted to sit the bar area or regular dinning.  We choice the regular dinning, so we can chit chat since we have not seen each other in awhile.  Got out our drink orders right away.  I got the patty melt w/french fries.  It was ok, more seasoning on the burger would be nice.  The service was great.  Need to get up early to try breakfast next time.

I came here for a group of 25ppl for a bday celebration.  We had a great time and fun!  The wait staff was friendly and pretty good to making sure all of us got our stuff right.  I am not a shell seafood fan, so I opted out to try their BBQ.  I took the brisket sandwich.  It was ok!  The fries were good.  The sauces were good.  I guess I should have ordered the fish instead.

It is a small place if you have more than 4 dining.  You will need to wait!  We had 6 of us.  It was about 45mins to wait.  We figure we will chit chat and wait the bar area.  It is small at the bar area.  We were finally seated, it took a little to get our drink and food order.  They were packed and busy.  We ordered the board (cheeses, breads, humus, etc.).  It was very good.  I ordered the beef dip with french fries.  It was very good.  Very flavorful and good crispy fries.  Small con was getting the server's attention for a refill.

I got 3 huge dogs (65, 85 & 95 lbs), so it is like a circus act getting everyone to the groomers.  I saw their van driving around so I got the info and check them out on the website.  I thought hey what the heck, I will try it.    First time they came in Nov 2014, the dogs were a little scared but when I got in the van they jumped in too.  They were happy and waggy tails after the bath, short nails, and smelling good.  Second time they came back in Mar 2015, 2 of 3 dogs just jumped right in.  Again everyone looked great and smelling good.  I loved the fact that they come to you and it is not that much compared Petsmart.  Plus I don't have to wash my car every time I take the dogs to the groomers!  Win-win!

It is this tiny joint.  Ordered ice coffee (cold brewed), ice cream, and lemon bar.  The coffee  and lemon bar was good.  The ice cream was old so it was icy and super HARD.  The staff that took our order was in a rush or something.  And the place was so stuffy, we sat outside.

I ordered the pesto chicken pita with fries...  YUM!!!  And we shared an Opa Life Combo for appetizers:  Spanikopita, Tzatziki, Hummus, Dolmathes & Keftedes.  I have to say, it was GOOD Greek food!

Just had to come check out this place with all the great reviews.  The place is nice, clean, and smell delicious!  We each got our own macaroons and scope of gelato.  The macaroons are very good.  Texture (crispy, soft, and chewy) plus can't go wrong with coconut!  Gelato (vanilla) was very good too.  I could have eaten another macaroon, but someone will need to roll me back to the car.  LOL!  The owner was so sweet and let us try some of the gelato flavors.

Ordered online for pick up!  They email me back in 24 hours and confirmed the order.  Got there to pick up, said my name, and POOF the bundtinis were ready and boxes up.  They asked when we are eating them, I told them it is the next day Thanksgiving.  They took the boxes back to wrap them in clear wrap to keep the moisture in.  They were a hit on the dessert table.  :)

Ok.  I had to come try this subway like pizza joint!  Pick your pie, sauce, and toppings, OK with me.  So I got the wheat, red sauce, chicken, fresh basil, and BACON!  Yes, bacon!  I love the ease of ordering.  They threw my pizza into the oven and I paid.  Got my drink and sat for 5 mins and my pizza was delivered to my table.  It was HOT and tasty!  I would like the crust a tad crispier!  The place was pretty packed and many un-wiped tables.  I wiped my own and sat down.

I am not sure why or how my review is gone.  But I have been to the Glendale location several times.  I love the pizza and dessert!  My favorites:  MARGHERITA & POMO.  The pizzas are thin, light, and slightly crispy crust.   The flour-less chocolate cake is yummy!  The service there is always very friend.  No leftovers!

I was tagging along with my future sister in law.  She make an appt and told me to come with.  OK!  I love the boutique feel with the helpful staff.  They are very sweet not pushy plus they can custom any dress you see in the shop.  My future sister in law found her 1, 2, and 3 choices from there.  I know we will be back in June for her to narrow down the dresses.  What a great experience and awesome service they have.  Make sure you make an appt, so you will get full attention.

Came here on a Saturday night with 15 of us.  LOL!  We roll in large groups when it comes to food.  Our table did our own ordering, I took a lot of pics.  These are the things I remember eating: 1.  Pork and chicken dumplings:  Very good but I wanted the special soy blend instead on the regular soy on the table 2.  Beef noodle soup:  Beef has good flavor, the handmade noodles were not bad, the soup base needed a tag bit more flavor 3.  Green onion pancake:  OK, that was good not too greasy 4.  Pork and green bean stir fried noodles:  Love it.  Not greasy with the right amount of flavor 5.  Pan fried chow mien with assorted meat (don't know if that was the name):  The flavor was there, just wish we had more noodles 6.  Moo Shu Pork:  this is not the one that is wrapped up in the rice paper, it is stir fried.  It was very good also 7.  Soy bean milk:  was good you can ask for unsweetened  The service was OK.  Check on us here and there, but we had to wave them down for things.

I ordered for a 6am pick up for a party.  I got bagels, a ring of tarts, muffins, etc.  I was surprise when I got there, it was all packed and ready with napkins, utensils, and plates.  SWEET!  I have been back for sandwiches and soup.  1 con, the waiting area for togo/pick ups are very small and often a little dirty.

I finally got a chance to get to this new stand alone location.  All the locations I just to hit are closed:  Park Central, Christown, Arrowhead was my go to for awhile, and then the one on strip mall on Camelback.  I was so happy to see they just moved a little over.  Man, I missed my combo sandwich and those fries.  I was NOT let down.  The service is still so friendly and food is still so good.  When I was getting ready to go, one of the staff came by to ask if I wanted a refill on my ice tea before I leave.  That is super awesome since it is getting hot outside.

I have been here several times and keep forgetting to write a review!  OOPS!  Loved the breakfast and dinner selections.  The service is awesome and the food is changing with the seasons.  I ordered one of the quiche and they were out, hum!  The garlic hash brown was saltier than I liked.  Crispy Chicken Meatballs are so flavorful and good.  It is a MUST order!  The housemade pastas are delicious!!!  Desserts are yummy too!  I need to come back to keep trying more food!!!

Came here for a brunch bday party!!!  They accommodated our party of 15.  Love the service and attention we got from the staff.  Never had to ask for a refill.  Since a few of us were early, the special menu caught my eye....Bacon donuts???  Say it isn't so!  I had to order it.  It is freshly made, a little chewy/soft (but I like), and very f*cking awesome.  OUCH I need to work out an extra day to burn this off!!!  And of course, got the herb chicken and waffles since I blew the diet plan anyways.  The waffles was good, but I did not taste the vanilla.  The chicken was ok, I did not taste enough flavors.  It was covered by the fried onions on top.    Overall, it was a great time, great service, and good food!

I am so glad we were using our Yelp app to guide us to good eats and drinks.  You have not failed us.  This place is absolutely the best.  They use quality ingredients to make the drinks.  I got the almond milk tea with boba (probably one of the best I have tasted apart from Hong Kong).  I got the macha milk tea with boba, it was so good I was savor each spit.  The place is cute, clean, and the staff is amazing balls.  They 100% back up their drinks and desserts.  OH, I had the crepe here too.  Too bad I was so full, or I would have gotten another one.  If you are in Vegas and craving a tea, then drive off the strip and get here.

Came on a Friday night.  The place was kinda of empty.  Got the Korean fried chicken and poddak.  Yes, both are fried chicken with difference sauces...  They were very good and had great flavorful sauces.  The server we got was brand new, so he had to ask the other server when we had questions.

They screamed at me when I signed up to be POP star!  LOL!  Funny.  Get service, I was figuring out to roll my dog food container around while I am still shopping or what?  The staff, he roll it up front and it was there waiting for me.  :)  Of course with my hands free I found a few more things.

Came here for dinner with my friends.  We wanted to try the hot pot.  The place is nice, clean, and modern decor feel to it.  Service was good but a tad slow.  Ordered and inhaled:  1.  Agedashi Tofu - It was pretty good, could have a crispier outside 2.  Chicken & Neobiani Steak Skewer - Both skewers were good 3.  Pork Gyoza Pot - Japanese tonkotsu soup base pot with pork gyoza, egg, clear noodle, and assorted vegetable - I think it would have been been if I traded for udon noodles.  I love udon.

The place is HUGE!  Super friendly staff and took the time to explain items to us.  I ordered:  Juice:  strawberry and kiwi - It was filling on it's own (fresh blended fruits, you can taste them) Chicken Shawarma sandwich:  Tasty but it was the gyro was dry and hard.  Comes with french fries and a drink.  I got the mint hot tea (YUM). Juliet crepe:  chocolate and hazelnut - crepe was good but chewy.  The gelato ice cream was so so so GOOD.  Not overly sweet.

This place is easy to miss but thanks to L, she snapped pics and told me what to look for!  We met for happy hour and the place was pretty empty.  It was nice and clean.  And the staff is super helpful and friendly.  I got the chicken taquitos, they were crispy with guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gallo.  They were very good!  I could have eaten other plate.  I ordered the fish taco from the happy hour menu.  OMG, must order and inhale!  It was very good and not greasy!    The server was so helpful to explain the menu and the food.  What he suggested and his favorites.  The buñuelo was so so good!  Crispy, light, and yummy!

With all the 5 star reviews and some from my favorite Yelpers, so I had to come try this place.  The place is in the middle of a large strip mall and can be missed.  It is locally owned and the staff is very very friend.  The place is very clean, slightly small dinning area.  I got the chicken shawerma plate (hummus, rice, and french fries).  I thought it came with pita bread or they forgot it?  The chicken was very flavorful!  The hummus, rice, and fries was very good too.  The amount of food was HUGE!  Can you actually share a plate so you have dessert.  This is a 4.5 star overall rating, because looking at the other pics they did forgot to give us pita bread.

Their specialty is tea and coffe (iced or hot) with a twist of boba (some pop, fizzle, and then the regular ones).  They have a huge menu with all sorts of tea/coffee (please notice the names of the categories) kind of funny naughty.  hehehe!  Love it!  I got the Geisha with regular boba, was not ready for a popping boba in my mouth yet.  Geisha (green tea, with milk, and vanilla).  I loved it.  But it is on the pricy side if you add too many fun extras.

My mom and I visited the new stand alone Ono.  It was of course new and shiny!  We placed our order:  chicken combo for me, bbq combo for mom, and we shared a spam musubi.  The food was standard (good) like the other Ono's around.  The portions were huge, service is good, and loved the decor.
