Wondered what the little black things were in my meal. It's an infestation. This place has always been bad and it will never get better. Bad food, bad service.

Originally from NJ and this is the best pizza I've had in AZ! Additionally...great food, great atmosphere, and prices aren't bad at all. Parking issues? Who cares?! In that case, just bike or Uber over! Can't get enough of LGO.   P.S. Can't wait to try Ingo's (it's in the LGO family).

Delicious food, great atmosphere. Thank you to Dave, Ryan and the entire staff at Crust for making Dad's birthday dinner special. We'll be back soon...can't wait to check out that wine list. Thanks! Ross, Scottsdale.

George's is amazing! Last night my Mom and I stopped in to take out dinner and had the pleasure of seeing George. It is apparent he is dedicated to fantastic customer service and the best food! We had the meatballs and spaghetti and it was fantastic! Homemade! Katie took great care of us too! And dessert was great too...Nutella cheesecake!

Went for oil change on Wednesday, July 16, 2014, and Vicki & Rulon at McDowell Chapman Ford Quick Lube went way above and beyond! Superior customer service! Not only did they hook it up with the oil change but they did an entire vehicle inspection and even delivered my vehicle back to my place of employment due to time constraints! Wow! They deserve recognition and additional business. Thanks guys!  -Very satisfied customer Ross L. in Scottsdale.
