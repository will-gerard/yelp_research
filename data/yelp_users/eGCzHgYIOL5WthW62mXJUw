This is the second time I have tried their food.  The first time I thought it was ok so I thought I would try them again.  The resturant looked clean and was busy.  I saw someone else's food and it really looked good.  I wish I ordered that instead.  I ordered a chicken teriyaki to go.  A pretty easy dish that is normally is hard to mess up.  When I got to work and sampled my first bite I realized they messed it up.  The chicken was burnt and dry.  This was the worst I have ever eaten. They put so much sauce on it to me it seemed like they were trying to hide the fact it was dry.   I ate the rice around the chicken and tossed it. I guess I can cross this place off my list now.  Note to the cook:  if you burn the food I don't mind waiting for you to redo it.  The reason I won't eat here again is because the cook allowed burnt food to leave his kitchen.  If he let that happen who knows what other errors in his cooking he finds acceptable and will serve to his customers.  I could forgive a bad sauce but I can't forgive serving damaged food.

Since I took my order to go one of the primary things I look for in my food is how hot is it by the time I get back to work. It was so hot I had to wait another 5-10 minutes before I could take a bite.  For me this was a good thing since I did not want to eat a cool burrito.  Once I was able to devour it I was happy to discover how good it was.  The only sad part of my breakfast burito was the siesta was forced to take.  The service was great, food was great overall a great experience

I finally decided to give Republic a chance and boy was that a mistake.  I'll get the positive out of the way first.  I ordered gyoza, and it tasted fine but they looked and tasted like the kind you buy frozen at Asian market and throw in a wok to cook.    The worst of the experience was the boba.  I've had boba all over the city and while this looked like boba it was the worst.  I ordered almond milk tea and there was a very strong taste to it.  I realize my description will be a little off but the best way i can describe it is super sweet (without the good taste) and it had a kick to it.  It was like the almond was in overdrive. The boba were also hard.  I don't know if they were just under cooked but after a few sips I could not drink anymore of it.   There was nothing satisfying about this drink on a hot day.

Ordered take out. Pizza and garlic bread.  They gave me the pizza and sause for the bread but no bread.  The sad thing was the cashier did a double take to make sure everything was there but forgot something important.  I take part of the blame since I should have looked it over.  My advise if you do take out is to open everything

honestly i made a mistake when i ordered.  I wanted to try as much as i could thinking i would sample half and put the rest away for lunch the next day.  That was a mistake and i ate myself into a painful food coma.  First up was the chicken.  overall it was very tasty.  i liked that it had it's own unique taste.  i wanted to eat fried chicken that did not taste like KFC or Popeyes.  It's worth getting out of the car just for that.  Ribs - The ribs were also good.  Very meaty, very delicious.  my sides - i didn't eat much of because i was focused on the ribs and chicken  very happy i found it

Saw Which wich in the news and since I didn't plan on using their bathroom decided to give them a try.  The place looked clean and the ordering station was easy to follow.   Ordered a pepperoni pizzawich and overall it tastes really good.  While the marinara sauce was alright the bread and meat really made the sandwich.  It might sound like I'm knocking the sauce but overall it added to the enjoyment of the meal.   I will definitely come back and try something different.  Which wich is a huge improvement over a place like subway. It was a bit pricier but it was worth it.

It's a small but clean place.  The menu is pretty large with lots of different options.  I ordered the loco moco and overall really enjoyed it.  The food took awhile to complete (there was no lunch rush) but it was worth it.  I'm definitely going back and try something else.

it was Christmas Eve and I was a little worried about finding someone to get me in my house.  I called customer service and someone answered fairly quickly and said someone would be there 15-20 minutes.  To me this was already a good start since the place I called right before didn't answer their phone. Received a call from Kevin later saying he was on his way.  Overall my lock was rather difficult and Kevin was great in trying different ways to get me inside.  Finally I got in and was really happy with the job he did.

Went through the drive thru during lunch which probably wasn't the smartest thing to do because of the line.  The food was worth the wait.  I ordered the box combo which comes with 4 chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw, cane's sauce, Texas toast and a drink.    Since my work is a good distance away the fries and toast got cold so I would recommend eating there if you have a decently long drive to where you are going to eat it.  The chicken was awesome!  The meat wad juicy and the breading had a nice taste to it. You can definitely tell the difference between this place and other fast food type chicken fingers.  The size of the chicken fingers was decent.  They didn't feel like they were too small or too big. The toast was an interesting addition and it really filled me up  Overall this was a great lunch

Tampopo Ramen is by far the best ramen place in Az.  Everything about my bowel was very tasty.  I had the meso ramen and it was quite filling.  While I would have liked to ask for seconds I'm already fighting off the food coma so that would pretty much have been my downfall.  Friendly staff is also a huge plus.
