This is a great hotel to enjoy Las Vegas in. The pools aren't as fun as Caesar's, but then no one's are, and I originally found it distressing there was no pool bar at the suites' tower's pool, until I realized this meant I could BYO. The rooms are plush and fancified, the staff is polite, and they have a Bouchon, which means I have to love them (even if Bouchon's oatmeal has lost its "best in the world" stars from me).

My friend and I split courses here for lunch and it was way more than enough food. Our waitress was such a lovely person! Amazing service for sure (Bernadette! Loved her).   We split: a glass of wine (recommendation by Bernadette, stellar); the arugula and endive salad (great esp for hot weather); and the daily risotto, which was super good (english peas, ham, marscapone, pecorino romano), and then, because Susie couldn't resist, topped it off with a creme brulee.   Sitting on the patio with a fan, views over the pools, relaxing on a lazy Monday was lovely.

I did the tasting menu here with wine pairing. Two dishes were meh, two were great -- one of which was the steak, which they'd better knock out of the park ;). The wine was all excellent, and the service was actually superb. The decor and views over the valley are high end fabulous.   Basically, the night was perfect, but the food (specifically the appetizer and the fish) were just not great. It was 50/50 when I was looking for perfect.

This is the most expensive Starbucks I've ever been to!  It was over $10 for: a drip coffee, an apple, a yogurt, and a chocolate bar.  Bleh.  Also super slow service.  But friendly.  I wouldn't complain except for the toxic sticker shock.

I broke my cardinal rule of dining, which is never eat sushi/sashimi/Japanese food outside of California or Manhattan in the U.S., because the reviews of this place were so solid that I had to try it.  ShinBay blew my mind (in a super fantastical way).   We did the 4 course tasting menu (we couldn't call ahead to reserve a bigger tasting menu because we only found this place online 3 hours before dinner on our last night in Scottsdale). We also got a bottle of sake from the less expensive menu.   Every course was ridiculously amazing. The uni alone changed my world. It is the best sushi I have ever eaten in my life, and it may have ruined me for lesser places.  I will seriously fly back to Scottsdale just to eat here again, and I'm not that big a high roller. It's just worth it.

It's a five star boutique hotel inside of a five star resort. It's beautiful, quiet, the staff is lovely, they bring you free tea and coffee to your room in the mornings, there's a lovely wine hour each day at 4pm, the staff is impressively friendly and helpful, they'll golf cart or mercedes you to anywhere nearby that you want to go, and the infinity pool and hot tub in the back are gorgeous. Great off season rates, too.

This place was a nice little airport cafe. The staff was super nice, the breakfast burrito was solid (not authentic, but exactly what I wanted -- eggs and bacon wrapped in a tortilla with some salsa to dunk it in), and the coffee was good. They kept things moving quickly, and were just so friendly and welcoming that I felt all warm and fuzzy as I waited on my 3 hours delayed flight x_X
