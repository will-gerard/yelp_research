I like going to this place because it has a very simple menu but the food is always good.

Overall feel of this place is very busy and that is a good thing because it means people are there to enjoy the food. I got the pho with sirloin and it had lots of meat which makes a great bowl. This will be a place I will revisit.

My first time here was really good the Horchata had strawberry in it and cinnamon on top. I got the shark and shrimp burrito and it had lots of flavor. The Burrito was big enough to probably share with two light eaters. The salsa bar was great I tried somethings that were outside of my normal but it was a good experience all around. Other than the place being small I have no complaints. Great place.

We did not like this place it took 4 months to deal with place. Took our money and we did not have a prescription till 7/8/18. Our original eye exam was 3/12/15 staff issues all the time. However there was only one lady that was helpful. Contact me for more info.

6" Torpedo with voodo chips are a great combo! You can't go wrong eating here. This food is a Az classic. It's a really simple sandwich and that's why so many like it.

The first time here I got a number two added some soy sauce with a drink. The price was great atmosphere was good and clean and friendly. 5/22/15 Second visit I tried the number 11 with sardines who would have thought but this place is good. Give it a try.

Thanks Luis for the hair cut and the trim. Always a good day when I can get my haircut. This place is very clean, staff is really nice and they can get you in pretty quickly.
