I have been going to Dr Fauer for about 5 years now and I think he's great!  He takes the time to actually talk to you about what's going on. He doesn't rush in and do a 2 minute assessment.

The food here is AMAZING!!!  I don't know what else to say.  This place doesn't have 4 stars and almost 250 reviews for no reason. Carolina's has been around forever and there's a reason for it. It's the best.

This has to be one of the worst airports ever!  If you get dropped off (or picked up), you get yelled at for taking too long. Then they have double "parking" on drop off so you get yelled out for not being able to move. Huh?  Once inside you're kind of on your own...not a lot of signs to direct you to the right place. If you ask for help, you will more than likely be "greeted" with an unfriendly "yeah".  The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because they do have free wifi.

It's so difficult to find a good fish fry place in Phoenix but I think this is pretty good. I had the catfish and shrimp combo with fries. At first bite I was surprised at how great it was. Not bland at all like another nearby place. The shrimp was butterfly and the breading on both the catfish and the shrimp was really good....not too much and not too little. I think if you're looking for a place with good fried fish, you definitely need to check it out!!

I really liked this location!  The coffee is good...the same as any other location but I felt really comfy here. The place wasn't packed but they were busy. People coming and going constantly. I noticed that the people going there were definitely regulars as the staff knew everyone's name that walked in the door. Even though they knew their customers, it never interrupted the flow of traffic in there. The customers waiting never had to stand and wait because the barista was catching up with the regulars.

I have been to this location a couple times and have always found really good deals on what I was looking for. This last time I actually sold some books and the process was so easy!!  I have found that the people that work there actually know about books and the authors!  Amazing!  Imagine that!  A bookstore where the people know about books!  How refreshing!  I'll be back!

I wandered in this location to check out a TV and check out the iPad mini. The guy who helped me with the TV's was very knowledgable and very helpful. He took the time to go over a lot of my questions and concerns. He was great.   So then I went to check out the iPad mini. I have the iPad 2 and wanted to see if the mini was worth it. The kid that was helping me wasn't overly helpful and that was ok. The thing that wasn't really ok was that after I was there for about 45 minutes I decided I was going to make the purchase...the kid THEN decides to tell me that they are out of stock!  Really?!  So I asked about other locations and it turns out nobody had them in stock. There was another customer there that just experienced the same thing so we decided to just get it from the Apple store. Best choice I ever made!

I should've listened to the other reviewers. Rude and annoyed. That describes the people working there on the particular day I was there. They seemed annoyed that people were there to order coffee!  The cashier was rude and rolled her eyes when someone said "Oh!  Can I also get a pumpkin muffin?"  It made me uncomfortable. I ordered a peppermint mocha and when I took a sip it was soooooo strong I felt like I did a shot of peppermint schnapps!  I went to the counter and said "I think there's an extra shot of peppermint in here. It's really strong". The girl took it from me and made me another one. Never said a word. Not a sorry, not a oh no let me make you another one.....nothing. I guess I'll stick with what I know and not change up my routine.

Went to the late night bingo and it was fun. They have the new bingo hall that just reopened recently. I have never been here before so I don't know what it was like before but I thought it was pretty good. Every casino is really smoky but I think they did a pretty good job with the ventilation in this room. The people that were working were really really nice and helpful. I can't wait to go back!

Being a woman, I always dread having to do anything car related. I always feel like I have to put my guard up right away.  I looked online at tires and decided to go to Discount. I placed my order online and made an appt for the next morning. My appt time was for 8am and I showed up on time.  I was promptly greeted and let them know I had an appt. they pulled up my order, verified it and get this.....they didn't try and sell me more expensive tires!!!  I paid and then waited a short time. I was driving away at 8:42am.  I would definately come back to this location.

I usually would think one Burger King is the same as the next but....wow....this place was terrible! I got a coupon in the mail and saw they have a new chicken parm sandwich and I was in a hurry so I decided what the hell. After I ordered and I got to the window, the woman at the window didn't even acknowledge me. After a few minutes, she told me my total, I paid, she gave me my food and closed the window. Never heard another word after my total. That should have been an indication of what my food was going to be like. When I pulled up to the end of the drive thru, I opened my bag, unwrapped my sandwich and thought the bread was a bit cold. I took a bite into my sandwich only to find that bun was slightly frozen, the marinara sauce cold, the cheese frozen and the chicken lukewarm at best!  I put the car in reverse, went to the window and waited. The same woman opened the window, didn't say anything to me so I told her about the sandwich. I explained that the sandwich was cold and the cheese was frozen. Her reply?  Well after what seemed like an eternity of silence, her reply was "no it's not. The cheese is cold though". I said "noooo...the sandwich is cold and the bun is a bit frozen still". After snatching the sandwich out of my hand, she closed the window. A couple minutes later a guy handed me a bag with a new sandwich. Again, no words. Just window opened and then closed. I was afraid to open the bag but I was brave. This time the chicken was hot and everything was cold.  I couldn't even eat it. I just ended up throwing it away. They have lost my business.

I live nearby and really like this place. They make their bagels fresh every morning and they make their own cream cheese. I like my everything bagel with the nova cream cheese. Yummy!  They get busy on the weekends very early and once they're out of something, they're out. They always have a lot of everything but I've been there later in the morning on a Saturday and they were out of a certain kind of bagel.  Sooooo good!!!

The food here is ok...it's a hit or miss.  The service is what actually makes me only give 2 stars though. Tonight I was in the drive thru with 2 cars in front of me and waited a total of 17 minutes!  If it wasn't for the person behind me blocking me in and the person behind him, I would have left.  When I finally got to the speaker to order, it took forever for them to acknowledge me. I ordered and the guy repeated it back then ...... Nothing.  Me: "that's all..thanks". Them: .....nothing.  Me: "hello?". Them: "ok yeah..pull up".  You know....not sure if they're in a carb coma from the food or if they're high (or both) but...ugh...frustrating!  That long wait made me miss Seinfeld!

I don't know why this place has so many bad reviews!  Sing High has definately been there for a long time and it's for a reason.  If they didn't do any business, they would be out of business.  I have been there on days when it's not as good as other times but I guess it depends on who's cooking.  They have the best and biggest egg rolls I have ever seen!  The egg foo young is really good and the pork fried rice is excellent.  I have never walked out of there saying "that was terrible".

Out of all the locations, this one seems to be the most friendly location. The girl that was working that day was there alone and the place was packed!  She was still very friendly while working very quickly. I only use Hair One for my shampoo/conditioner and will only be making my purchases here.

I have been to this location a few times before work and they're quick!!  Prior to this, I hadn't been to a Boston Market in years!  The last time I was there, they had plastic forks and knives and plastic plates that was sectioned off for your food. Now...real silverware and real plates!!   Nice!  :) I love that they offer bowls now too. They are the perfect size and you can get anything you want in it!  Hmmm.  All this talking is making me want to go now!!

I really liked this place.  When you walk in, go past the front part and into a warehouse where they are actually processing orders. This place has everything and its neatly arranged. The people working there are very helpful and very nice.   They're not any cheaper than the other places but let them know where you work. They give a **really** nice discount!

Being originally from Chicago, I can tell you that Spinatos is the best pizza that I have found in the Phoenix area!  I like thin crust and their thin crust is light and cooked to perfection.  When you ask for Italian sausage you actually get.....get this....Italian sausage!  Not that crap like in other places!  The sauce is so good and it's sweet!  .... Just like my Chicago pizza!!  The service is always good and the pizza is always the same:  AMAZING!

I wasn't too sure about a Philly with cheez whiz but wow!!!  It was so good!!  My friend had the sandwich with spinach and provolone and that was really good too!  The fries were good and you get large portions. The sandwich was also huge. Don't forget to check in as you unlock a deal for free fries. The staff is really nice and the new location is really cool.

I had my cartilage pierced a few months ago at a different place and needed to change out my earring. Based off of a recommendation and all the Yelp reviews I decided to go check this place out. I needed them to take the earring out since I couldn't get it off and the guy who did it was really nice!  This place is CLEAN!  They wear gloves (as well they should) and changed them out if they had to touch something else. He put my new earring in and explained how to clean it and advised for me to leave this one in a bit longer before I put other earrings in. I highly recommend this place!!  My only tip would be if you're going to go here on the weekend, be sure you go during the day. It's difficult to find parking at night is since its right by ASU.

I hate that I even have to give 1 star. I kept hearing how great this place was from a friend and the reviews were good. Since I was nearby I decided to check it out. Never again. I got one of the lunch specials which was a chicken enchilada, rice and beans. Lets start off with the enchilada....I asked for green sauce (chili). I don't know what that was but it definitely wasn't green chili. The cilantro lime rice?  Tasted like dried up white rice with some color added to it. You get a choice of black beans or pinto beans. I went with the pinto. Another...I don't know what was IN the beans but it was disgusting. My food was cold as well.  Anyone that knows me knows that I never throw food out. However, today I did just that. I wasn't able to even eat it!  I ended up throwing it away and I don't remember the last time I did that. I was so disgusted that I would not be able to even give it a 2nd chance.

Wow!  I was on a mission for the perfect boot and the the pair I saw online seemed to be what I was looking for. They were sold out but the girl that was helping me tried to find something similar. My problem is that I have tree stumps for legs so everything was too tall for me. We ended up ordering the pair I saw online and she did everything for me. She was nice and didn't seem put out. Very helpful!!

I'm not even sure where to begin with this.  We showed up right at the start of dinner and food from lunch was still out and they were slowly putting out dinner food. The sushi?  Yuck. It tasted like what you get from the grocery store deli. We saw peel and eat shrimp...yay!  Gross. How can you mess that up?!  The lo mein was really good but I didn't find much up there where I can actually say "Wow!  This is really good!"  Another thing... I have a lot of food allergies and they didn't have a lot of their items labeled. With all this being said, I would say that for the price it's worth it just for the crab alone.

I keep odd hours so sometimes I'm grocery shopping very late. This particular night, the only registers that were open was the self check out. I like the self check out when I have a few times. But when you have an entire cart load, that's not gonna work. There were others with full carts too. I had to ask to have a register opened and they opened another one...and they were nice about it...but .... Really?!  Self check out only?!?!  I almost just decided to leave my groceries!

I'm not sure why I have lived in Phoenix for 9 years and have never eaten here before!  My friend has been going here for years and said we need to go for lunch. When you walk in, you order at the counter and then they bring it out to your table. I have seen some complain about that but I'm not sure why. I had an enchilada with green sauce and a soft rolled taco, rice and beans. The beans taste like REAL beans and not canned. The rice was good and the green sauce...wow!!  I only wish I found this place years ago!

When I go out of town, I love parking here at the parking spot!  They are less expensive than anywhere else around and all of their spots are covered. You have to have that here in Phoenix. You always get a bottle of water on the way out and they always offer coupons on their website. Just be sure you print it off because they can't take it off of your phone.

I've been going to Freestone for about 6 months now and I like it better than any gym I have ever belonged to. The staff is friendly and the facilities are great!  They have a rockwall and I have seen kids as well as adults on it. Although....I would never do it!  The fitness classes they offer are great too and the times work with my schedule.

I have been going to Angel Sweet for a few years now and it has yet to disappoint.  They have the best gelato outside of Italy and today was no exception.  They always have the same basic flavors and then they add others on a daily basis.  I have been to other gelato places and they definitely do not compare.  Be sure to try the apple cinnamon...WOW!! Pros:     The flavors are plentiful and amazing!               The staff is very nice               Open late               They have a water cooler for free water  Cons:     I wish they were open 24/7  :)

This was my first time EVER in an Apple store!!  I'm not sure I'll ever buy another Apple product outside of an Apple store!  The customer service was outstanding and the place was just plain fun!!  The set up for this place was great with all the different tables. They even had a table just for kids with iPads for them to play with. I never knew that they offered workshops to teach you how to get better use of your product. These people are marketing geniuses!!

I usually assume that all Starbucks are going to be the same. Wrong. I got a tall iced caramel macchiato and a bagel with cream cheese. I'm not sure what kind of drink this was but it wasn't what I ordered. Oh well...they made me another.  Pro. Con:  The person running the register has some serious ADD or is just plain rude. There was a lady that was placing a large order and while she was ordering, his cell phone rang!!  "hey what's up man? .... Oh nothing...just at work". The phone conversation went on for at LEAST 5 minutes. The customer just stood there staring at this kid!   It's Saturday morning and this place is hopping and the other employees see to be working hard but this one guy kind of ruined it for me and has therefore forced me to give only 2 stars.

I decided to check this place out since my regular girl wasn't available. I called and made my appt time with no problem. However, when I got there they didn't have me down. All my info was in the computer but my appt time was not. They were able to get me in right away and with the person that I originally had the appt with...so that's good. I found out that when you call, the call gets routed to a call center and they do the appts which explains what happened. I was told by the girl that did my waxing that when I call, ask to be transferred directly to the location.  So anyway....walking in, I noticed that the place was very clean. Yes!  Once I got called back, the room I was in was very clean. Yes!  The girl that did my waxing was very good and it didn't hurt at all. They use hard wax here and not strips and that seemed to make a difference.  After we were done, I liked that she removed the paper sheet on the table and sprayed and wiped it down.....another plus!!  Overall, I really liked this place and I was a little worried based off some of the reviews. If I was in the area longer, I would definitely go back!  Ask for Carrie!

The day that I went to eat here it was almost 2 in the afternoon and the place was dirty. There were 2 of us here and 7 employees and just about every table was dirty. I decided to ask for some napkins and cleaned my own table.  Once I got my sandwich I thought it was ok. I don't think I'll be back.  I remember Jimmy Johns from Illinois State University but this is definitely not the Jimmy Johns of ISU!

I wasn't overly impressed with DSW this time. Not sure if they just didn't have a good selection at this time or if it was just the location. Also, I was in the store for about 30 minutes and nobody asked if I needed any help.

Found this place thanks to Yelp!  Glad I finally went!  My friend and I decided to go for a later lunch and they had $6.95 lunch specials. This was perfect since neither one of us had been there before.  We decided to each get a different dish and then share. We opted for the Pollo Saltado and the Tallarin Saltado de pollo. The portions are huge and it was really really good!  Next time I would really like to try the Lomo Saltado. Actually, I wanna try everything on the menu.  The service was ok. The girl that waited on us was unsure of the soup but did go ask about it. I had to ask for more water. I still will go back to try other stuff though!!

A friend and I went to the Langley's Country Market and thought the store was kind of cute but they carry items that you can get up the road for cheaper.  The thing that really got me was their "petting zoo".  It had a goat, sheep and a chicken coop.  Look at the pictures posted on here.  The chickens were literally standing in (standing) water and their own feces.  The sheep and the goat had nowhere to stand because there was standing water in about 90% of the fenced off area that they had.  Oh...did I mention that the sheep and goat had absolutely NO shelter and were out in the blazing sun?!  They have a sign that reads "Fresh Market"....one of the things they sell are "fresh eggs".  Not sure if the eggs are coming from their chickens but regardless, I would not buy anything from this place!

I have been here on a couple occasions and am just now getting around to writing my review.  I got a pedi and the girl who did it was great!  I was able to walk in and get seen right away.  They have several different packages you can get for your pedi, mani, etc. and you know up front how much it's going to cost. No $5 more at this place.  I will be back!

I found this place completely by accident and it was great!  I have been going pretty much once a week since discovering taco caliente. I love that you can choose from about 4-5 different meats and everything is completely fresh. .... Nothing is fried!  The service is good and the owner always stops to chit chat with me.  The salsa bar is pretty good and the hot is actually hot!  Love it!  Can't wait to go this week!   The only thing is that I wish they were open later but I know they just opened recently.  Hopefully, they'll extend their hours soon. :)

Finally decided to try this place out since its next to my coffee place.  I though it was pretty good and the service was quick and friendly.  They were pretty busy and the place was clean too. I got the Jersey Shores Favorite and thought it was pretty good and I liked that they sliced the meat right then and there.....no opening the package in front of you like another sandwich place!  I will definitely be back!

I went for dinner tonight and had the gyro pita with rice. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. It was quick and hot and very fresh!  It seems to be family owned and ran and that is a huge plus for me. The only thing ... And it's not that big a deal but I asked for no lettuce and it had lettuce on it. It wasn't shredded so it was super easy to pull off. I really wanted to try their hummus but I will save that for next time.  Hmm...maybe I'll go back tonight for the pita and hummus!  Lol

I was really surprised by this place!  Soooo much better than that other "bertos" place!  I went thru the drive thru so I'm not sure about the inside but I ordered the taco and cheese enchilada combo with rice and beans. I also ordered a side of chips. The food was very good and the rice was REALLY good!  The chips were hot!!  Loved it!  Yum!  I will be back when I'm in the area again.
