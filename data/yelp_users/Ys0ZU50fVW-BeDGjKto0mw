Little hole in the wall buffet. Very inexpensive for great food. The pollos magnifico was awesome and the owner offered me a taco which he brought right to me.  The only drawback was no beer but I was there midday during the week do I wouldn't have wanted one anyway. I think they have a drivethrough as well

Giving blood can be a little stressful, but the staff here is pretty cool.  My only complaint is that it takes so long.  I gave double reds for my birthday and it took 2.5 hours from when I walked in the door- and I have big garden hose veins so it wasn't me.  My wife was a little upset because we were going on vacation and it delayed our trip a tad.  But enough about me.  The phlebotemist didn't miss my vein, I got to watch Tremmors on TV and pigged out on cookies and juice.  I highly recommend that you give blood- if not here then somewhere else.

Money in pocket to spend. Not even a hello in an uncrowded but nice looking store with what looked like a good inventory. Looks like I'm going to Bass

Rock hard Panini- nasty. They messed up or order a tad but the GM- Rich,was super friendly about it and took care of it. Regardless of who is at fault, being pleasant about it makes a huge difference between "never again" and "repeat business." But I won't go back

customer service stinks- enough said.  i asked my doctor for a dermatologist referal and was given this guy.  in doing my own research i couldn't find a web page for them besides a single page with no contact information.  i called and after immediately being put on hold for 5 minutes i got hung up on.  yeah, i really want to go there now- heck, i don't even trust my primary care doctor after this

this was 1 of the rare times I went to frys. I walked around the whole store, and was only greeted by a dude in appliances. I wasn't going to buy anything big, but I was still going to buy some stuff. then when I went to the checkout line and it was literally over 30 people ahead of me- on a wednesday afternoon- I decided it was time to leave empty handed. as sonny carolla would say " it's just a waste of my time"

A friend suggested this place and when I walked in I could tell it was popular but I went right up to the counter.  I told the guy I'd never been there before so he offered samplers of their popular items.  But then I was confused.  The menu is Chines style pictures on the wall, but the guy was describing a combo platter.  So the menu presentation is horrible (for newbies).  Then when I finally figured out what to order, he went into explaining how to order next time with all their shorthand- even more confusing- and the assumption is that I'd be eating there every day.  BUT, the food was AWESOME.  I can't believe my mother in law lives like a mile from here.  Now when my wife says she wants to visit her mom, I'll be mor enthusiastic about making the trek!

finally found a nearby place that sells korean food.  we made a little adventure of it and got the staples of a few meals.  it's tiny by comparison to stuff in socal, but phoenix ain't exactly an asian mecca.  i was a little confused by the self serve bulgogi as there was only a roll of vegetable bags nearby.  i was about to start scooping it in when a guy showed me the tubs.  my boy was plugging his nose the whole time complaining about the smell- he's only 1/4 asian so it was funny, but it's an asian market and asians like fish, so if anyone is complaining about an asian market smelling fishy then they need to lighten up.

Was referred to Dr Ginsberg by my urologist. Called to set up an appointment as a new patient and of course they asked if i had insurance and through whom.  Told me they honor that insurance.  I took time off from work, went in today started filling out paperwork and they told me that they take that insurance but not that Network. Thanks for wasting my time.  How about training your office staff to ask the right questions? I cant stand incompetency

Pizza was ok, but two complaints- one is not that bad.  After we paid and sat down- like 10 minutes later, I went up to get our pitcher of beer and the girl didn't ask for my receipt. So just go up with authority and say "i didn't get my beer" and you can probably get free beer. Secondly, this is the kind of joint where you play games and get tickets. When your 5 year old needs to spend 360 points its like pulling teeth to get him to decide... But when he's made his decision and the guy behind the counter then says that they are all out of that item- that sucks. Then when he decides on a second item (5 more minutes) and the guy tells you that there out off that- it sucks even more.  Add a third time and now I'm pissed off.  Were talking about a total inventory carrying cost of like $200 worth of cheap chinese junk and they can't figure out what's most popular and keep it in stock?  Totally ruined my time and my 5 year olds as he got stuck with crap he never wanted in the first place plus 20 jolly ranchers

first time there in the past year.  used a gift card i got because of poor service last time.  guess what... super slow service again.  good food, but it took so long to come that we filled up on chips.  if it wasn't for the slow service i'd give it 4 stars

I've never eaten here and never had a desire to.  My wife insisted, so she won.  The food wasn't anything special, but the customer service was top notch.  And in my book customer service us 80% of the experience.  Plus, my kids dig it too.  Next time my wife suggests it as a fast food option, I won't complain too much.

The best dentists around.  When choosing a dentist, make sure you pick one who is more concerned with YOUR best interests instead of their bottom line.  I've never been pressured into excessive work, the staff is very friendly and the doctors are good people.  Here's a post-script example.  My son was diagnosed with like a dozen cavities and they said we should do it on 4 separate visits-per quadrant- so it's not so stressful for him.  After the first one, he was convinced to change his hygeine habits.  We did the second and third, but then the doc said that he has clearly improved his care and that we could skip the fourth quadrant (they're primary teeth).  they could have easily let us do that fourth visit and made more money, but they didn't.  that's pretty cool

i had never been before but was very impressed.  got the ahi salad and it was substantial- not just in size, but in variety of vegetables.  the place's draw is the locally grown vegetables.  everything was awesome and tasty.  the big complaint- flies.  we were inside and flies were driving me crazy.  that's the only reason i didn't rate this a 5.  food is awesome

We visited way back when they first opened years ago when they had a "no dancing" rule due to a loser neighbor.  Even though we live in Queen Creek we simply never went back. Went last night and were blown away by everything.  Atmosphere is great with lots to do.  It's a very wide open indoor/outdoor location with lots of party mingling. Multiple bars to get drinks.  Sports on tv. The place was packed.  While we waited for our table we socialized with strangers, noticed the large amount of snowbirds and other non-locals. Two people told me that they were at the golf tournament in Scottsdale that day- which is over an hour from here, so it's cool that people made the trek due to the reputation of the place.  But here's the kicker- the food was outstanding.  My wife got the steak and lobster which was excellent, and I got the baby back ribs. The taste of the ribs was awesome but the only negative was that some of my ribs were dry/overcooked.  We didn't even stick around for the band but the stage looked pretty sweet.  A must-visit place in the valley regardless of where you are coming from- and that not some home town rah rah talk.

I've only eaten here twice but both times ive been pleasantly surprised by the price.  I'm no steak connoisseur but I love me some dead bloody cow that's cooked right.  Both times our waitress was pleasant- that's right "waitress", and I just assume that I'm going to get nickel and dinged for everything. Don't get me wrong, they're always trying to upsell you with certain fixings, but it's mostly low key.  I am now sold on this place.  2 adults, 2 kids, blooming onion, big beer- under $65 out the door

Great food, everyone loves it.  But if you're buying a gift card, shouldn't the purchaser get the reward points?  After all, the restaurant is getting their money instantly and a large percentage of gift cards never get used.  Why would I ever want to buy another gift card there if I don't get anything out of it?

after shopping at the costco next door for 8 years we finally decided to try out arriba.  what a stupid idea.  it was 8:30 so it wasn't crowded.  when we sat down we immediately asked for water and nobody brought it.  when the server came we asked her for water but she had chips with her.  5 minutes later someone else brought it and we were even more thirsty.  did i mention that it wasn't crowded?  right when we walked in they sat us down.  after the water came and we downed it she finally came to take our order.  we ordered and i noticed that they have their own microbrew beer so i asked for a sample of one of them before i ordered a 22 ouncer.  food came pretty quickly but there were only two place settings and she didn't bring me the beer sample- i had to remind her. she brought the settings but no sample.  she brought the sample and left.  when we were most of the way through our dinner she came to ask if i liked the beer?  who cares?  i'm not ordering one now anyway!!!!  i will say that the food was good but this is about the whole experience.  when she finally came to ask if we wanted a desert we asked for stuffed sopapillas and she left.  then our kids changed their mind so i told them to go find her.  they were gone for 5 minutes and came back to tell us that they couldn't find her.  they left again and couldn't find her so came back.  then she came back to tell us that they were out of sopapillas!!  cool, so we order what the kids want and she leaves.  5 minutes later she comes back and tells us again that they are out of sopapillas and we look at her and say "yeah, that's why we want the other thing..."  she brings it another 5 minutes later and finally brings us our bill.  i put my card on it, we wait, the kids get restless and the family decide to go wait outside.  only then did she come take my card to pay.  way to make a good first and last impression.    We are never ever ever, going back to Arriba.   You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me.   We are never ever ever, going back to Arriba

This place never ceases to amaze me. In a day and age of warehouse stores, I assumed their prices would be higher. After I bought my first set of tires there I will never buy them anywhere else.  And here's the kicker- their customer service is ALWAYS the best- very courteous and its not just the guys in the lobby.  One of the few companies that really gets it.

No play area? Bad idea when chik fil a is right down the street. The food... Its mcdonalds  months later... I now officially hate this location.  My 5 year old had the day off from school and I had the day off from work.  I needed my tires rotated (see my Discount Tire comments) and it was lunch time.  My son was excited to go to McDonalds, so we dropped my car off at Discount Tire and walked to McDonalds- it was very windy and he was a little annoyed.  We got to McDonalds and their debit functionality was offline.  So I had no cash on me and I had to explain to my 5 year old that we couldn't eat there.  We had to walk back to Discount Tire and cancel our rotation.  I then called another Discount Tire with food within walking distance and they were not busy- so we went there and between the call and our arrival they got slammed.  So rather than get my tires rotated there and go to Chik-Fil-A, we drove back to our local Chik-Fil-A for a wonderful lunch.  I blame McDonalds for a horrible day.

Yeah, it's a big box store, but they've got so much cool stuff.  When my wife said she wanted to go there, I was just happy that a BevMo was across the street.  But we never got to BevMo and I was happy.  It sounds lame to marvel at "helpful" doodads for around the house, but there are so many cool things there that you're sure to get some good stuff.

i'm not much of a sub fan, but i was blown away by what i got.  it was the new york steamer and it was the right amount of juicy without soaking through to the bread.  it melted in my mouth and tasted awesome.  it's a firehouse theme so it was cool that there was an actual firetruck out front- and city of Mesa firemen eating there.  I guess that was just a timing thing, but my son got a kick out of it.  Plus they've got one of those fancy digital Coke machines that are all the rage.  Too bad I gave up soda a year ago.  Hey, how bout a digital beer machine...

i've had 3 bad experiences at this particular location.    1. Cold doughnuts at 7am? This isnt how doughnuts are supposed to be.  i went through the drivethrough and asked for the freshest doughnut.  she said "they're all fresh".  i then asked "give me the one that came out of the oven most recently" to which she replied "they all come out at the same time".    2. i once ordered 2 doughnuts through the drivethrough and as i went to get my first one (2 miles away on my way to work) it looked like it had a bite taken out of it.  do you really think i'm going to turn around and go back on a $1 purchase?    3. i got shortchanged to the tune of $15.  i guess it's my own fault for not counting my change, but when i got to work and realized what had happened, i called and sure enough the manager confirmed that their til was over by $15.

This place gets worse and worse every time I come here- but it's the only drive thru donut shop in Queen Creek. Donuts are always cold. Drive thru service is ridiculously slow- and even the drive through configuration makes no sense. You literally have to do a loop-de-loop to: avoid cars coming out of the drivethrough and then go out the same shopping center driveway to get back on the road.  Are they taking advantage of their monopoly?  Because as soon as someone else shows up with even a little better service, DD will disappear.  To summarize some of my "best" visits: chocolate cake donut with chunk missing, shortchanged me.

Dr. Lin and his staff are great. I went in for a kidney stone in January 2010 and that went well.  I then went in for the big V in December 2010... it was straightforward, the doctor was very comforting and the procedure went very well.  I'm sure my jokes about strange women grabbing my bits and pieces fell on deaf ears but that's how I dealt with it.  Healing went smoothly and I was back to normal functionality in 3 weeks.  I've had 3 friends go through the procedure elsewhere and all three got infections or some other sort of complication.  I'm happy to say that mine went flawlessly- and as of Friday, in the immortal words of the Cabin Boy- Chris Elliot "These pipes are clean!!!!!"

I'm not too into shaved ice but the kids love it. Unfortunately they closed the location by our home but this one is close enough. My daughter dropped her entire drink on the floor and they comped her another one-even though I insisted that it wasn't their fault that she dropped it.

Don't let the lack of reviews get you down like it did me.  My coworker suggested this place and we were not disappointed.  Great servings, good prices.  Nice staff.  It was a lunch crowd so they could have been a little more efficient at the register, but it was worth the wait.  Don't let the "Hot Dog" detract you- this isn't ballpark or Quiktrip dogs- and it isn't Wonder Bread.  Definately in our rotation now

The good- I've finally found a real Jewish deli in Arizona.  Coming from California I was spoiled by the Katella Deli.  The food was great with great variety.  The bad- I got a Yelp coupon for 10% off and the waitress forgot to apply it.  Then when I asked her to fix it and add a cupcake to go, she still forgot to apply it.  Overall- well worth it if you're jonesing for generous sandwiches.

we've been jonesin for hawaiian food since we got back from maui last month.  new restaurant in town and a coupon and a friday night means a night out.  the place was empty or emptying out which is never a good sign and there's a wait for your food- because they cook it fresh!  it was very good.  good portions and it hit the spot.  we were very happy.    now, here's some constructive criticism- they need a little more hawaiian "flavor" there- maybe music or surf videos or even beach smelling candles.  hey, maybe they can pull off tiki torches in the parking lot!    now here's my shout out.  WHY is this place empty on a friday night?  i hate seeing good places going unappreciated.  this location is at the corner of thousands of homes and besides mcdonalds and dunkin donuts and a few hole in the wall joints, there's not much dining selection in the area.  i know times are tough, but plenty of you are shelling out money to go get the same old junk food.  you people of pecan creek and taylor ranch and wayne ranch and castlegate and encanterra need to support your local businesses- and it's good for you!  if this place sucked i wouldn't be saying this, so just remember, if this place goes out of business and you never get a chance to eat there, then you're missing out.

i'd never heard of this place and we thought we'd give it a try.  i accidentally ordered a bacon buger (2 patties) with relish because i thought it came with all the default toppings, but it only came with relish.  when i took it back, the staff was nice but the owner/manager was visibly dickish about it.  the new burger i got ended up being a single patty and they said i could keep the old one.  so of course i combined and now had a triple decker.  and i pounded that bad boy.  it was awesome.  the cajun fries are also outstanding- very big fries.  i only wish this place had shakes.

these guys are hit and miss and I've seen both ends of the spectrum. usually everybody there's real friendly but the glass chip guys are like buzzards. I got a nice car so I expected to be taken care of, so I guess my car gets treated a little better than the 1984 chevy blazer, but the times when they are done and I still see glaring issues is really annoying- yet they'll still take care of it. but i'll always go back here. and if you're into lame forearm tribal tattoos, I think that's part of the interview process that you must have them if you want to work there

can't believe it.  went in to buy a daniel defense AR15, money in pocket and these guys were totally rude.  4 people behind the counter, yes there were other customers but not even a greeting or "we'll be with you in a second"  hey guys, walk into Firehouse Subs- regardless of how busy they are, they always welcome you.  I'll bet if you retards added that simple act to your customer service people would be willing to wait an additional 15 minutes and your sales would go up 15%.  if you actually read this review, and implement it, then you will make more than enough extra revenue in a month to give me a gun for my free advice.  you're welcome.  the only positive note, i called a few days before to ask about building my own AR and the kid who answered was very nice and knowledgeable.  Think about it- super customer service for people sitting on their ass at home that are calling, but crap service to those who got dressed, got in the car and drove to your store...

just drove by and found this place.  we were seated at a great booth overlooking the restaurant.  the server was a bit snooty but he seemed to be like that with everyone- apparently we didn't reek of money like others there.  i would have appreciated a little better bedside manner, for instance, recommending things on the menu.  I asked what beers they had on tap and as several were foreign, he just assumed i'd know what they were.  we had  the Crudo Bruschetta and it was WONDERFUL.  I had the braised short ribs dish (I cannot remember the name) and it was incredible.  My wife had the lobster bisque and it was tasty but unsatisfying as the amount of lobster was less than what we are used to.  I highly recommend this place.  It was a reasonably priced dinner with great atmosphere
