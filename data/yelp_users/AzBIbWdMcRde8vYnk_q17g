I have been coming to Islands Dental since 2011 and never have I had any issues.  The staff is very pleasant and always accommodating!  I highly recommend Dr. Patel if you are looking for a new dentist!

This is the worst dealer that I have ever worked with!  I thought I was moving up when I sold my Honda and bought the BMW.  Not the case!  Once you own the car, the service department could care less about your needs.  It feels that you are bothering them when you bring your vehicle in.  I would steer clear from this dealer.  I had issues with my vehicle prior to warranty expiration.  When the item broke, 3 day after warranty expired, they would not fix and wanted nothing to do with me.  I will never give my business to Chapman again!

It is far and few between when doctors are on time for their appts.  Waited over an hour before doc walked in to see us.  This is not the type of visit I was expecting from Banner Ortho pediatric group.  Nurse Toni and P.A. were fantastic but other than that, it felt like facility was over booked and not ready to accommodate scheduled patients.

Buyer beware!  You get what you pay for.  Thought I was getting a good deal on gas.  However, when the pump stopped $7 into my transaction!  I had to spend over a half hour trying to justify why I should get my money back as they could not figure out how to give me the gas I paid for.  I left without resolution and extremely frustrated.  I was told to call back later in the day to speak to a manager.  I will never visit another Arco AM/PM as I have had an issue every time.  This is the last straw.  Sometimes convenience is just not worth it.

We stumbled on this location after we decided we didn't want to wait 30 plus minutes at our normal spot.  Service was slow at first.  However, once we ordered food came out in less than 10 minutes and was very good.  Pleasantly surprised after reading some of the other reviews.  Pies look amazing!  We will be back.  Not crowded and hit right in.
