I haven't even used Scott's and I know they are good to go. Why?  I took a car in to have some bodywork done, because it was near the end of its 4 year lease term.  I know the bank will probably charge me an arm & a leg so I figured I should get it taken care of before the inspection.    There I am, ready to give them money for work, but Brett tells me that they can do it for me but that I can save money by going to a good detailer to get the majority of the damage taken care of.    WOW!  Very impressed!  Very professional, very ethical people at Scott's!

I've lived in Thailand and enjoy Thai food so I wad excited to try Thai Rama since I've seen it a million times passing by.  Got the infamous trio I always get at a Thai restaurant: Tom yam goong, pad Thai, and green curry. All three were fails in my book. Since the flaming vessel they serve it in usually just keeps it warm rather than finish cooking it, we had a lukewarm soup with uncooked mushrooms and green onions. It was flavorful, but being lukewarm, fresh onions kept masking the flavor. Next, came the pad Thai. Too sweet and the noodles lacked definition. It was a big glob and they were really cheap with their proteins. Finally, the green curry came and it was very salty.   Will not return.

I don't know how this place stays in business.  Actually, I do know why, there aren't very many alternatives in that area.   They have really really tasteless burgers and everything is extremely greasy.  It's very expensive as well.  The only redeeming part are their fries, which are thick cut similar to steak fries but not as thick.

I love HUB.  I've been coming here since they were located on the lower level, which is two or three locations ago from where they are now!     To the guy who said that their stuff hasn't changed in 5 years, doesn't know what he's talking about.  They seem to carry something new every time I visit.   To the person who said they need to widen their price point, they haven't been to the store enough to see they really do hit all the price points with their denim.  They're not going to start carrying Wrangler or low grade Levis but they do have very good quality denim from the 150$ price point all the way to the 900$+ special editions I've seen there.  If you go when they have sales, you can score a nice pair of really high quality denim for under a 100$.   I think I have enough trips and experience with the merchandise and staff at HUB to know what I'm saying.   Everyone is really friendly, Jesse, Alyssa, and Tom, the owner.   I have over thirty pairs of denim from HUB and that isn't the end of it.  I've purchased belts, boots, shoes, underwear, laptop cases....  if you want something unique that no one else has, go to HUB.

Ladies here are very friendly, I've yet to see a male employee here.   I work close to here so I'm here pretty often.    Nothing stands out, as all branches of Starbucks are company owned and pretty are the same.  Extra star is for the extra care one barista took in ensuring I have the correct drinks.  Saved me a trip back!

When you don't always feel like eating yogurt and crave the rich flavor of real ice cream, Cold Stone hits the spot.    Even the smallest bowl is enough to satiate my sweet tooth, because all of their ice creams are really rich.  I've gotten to know most of the employees and they're good people.  If you're waiting in line too long, ask for the owner's phone number.  It's not the employee's fault the owner wants to cut back on people working.

This place is awesome!    I am pretty well-versed in Mexican cuisine and in all these years, I've never found a place this tasty!  The food takes a while to get prepared, but that tells you they actually cook it rather than "assemble" it as they do in most Mexican restaurants.    Menudo, posole, sopa de res, all variants of camaron.... Unbelievably good.  I've taken some of my employees after work and they ALL agree the food is legit!    Also, they are open 24 hours!    Forget Filibertos, Alibertos.. and any other "bertos" and try them out!  You will NOT be disappointed!

We went on a Thursdsy, after having read that it would be the best time.  I hadn't been here before, but after reading so many reviews and researching about Bianco, I had a very good idea of what to expect...  To those who complain about the wait: that's the allure of it all!  I love the fact that Pizzaria Bianco forces you into the European style of dining out.  You're supposed to take it slow, have wonderful company with great conversations with people you may or many not know... America has fallen into this instant gratification mode of dining that they don't know how to enjoy dining out the way it was meant to be...  Get there at least an hour and half before they open at five.  It should place you very close to the first seating, if not, very soon. If you come after they've opened, expect a three hour wait.  The list of names fills up fast.  They use an honor system so when you get there, ask who had just gotten there before you and see who gets there after you and your group. It's an honor system, so when they are about to open at five, just go find your place in line.    During the wait, go next door to the bar because they open at four.  Order drinks and enjoy your company.   If you're unsure or uneasy, just send a member of your party next door to Bar Bianco for drinks & appetizers.  Everything was fresh and delicious.   The margherita pizza is the best in my opinion.  Five of us, two appetizers, two bottles of wine, five pizzas came out to around 50 dollars a person, including the tip.   Not cheap, but then again, not ordinary pizza either.    I think it's an awesome place for a date because you have a lot of time to talk and enjoy the food.

Was introduced to this place by a friend, it seems as though this is where you can find all the hipsters of Arizona. :P  I do have to admit their coffee is damn good.  Two times I've been here I've had the cappuccino and it's been great.  The second time I went, I took some "Starbucks" drinkers and they enjoyed their cappuccinos straight up; sans a gallon of syrup and chocolate sauce.

I literally live a block away from this place and this is the default place to take guests to eat when they're in town.    They grow their vegetables fresh behind the restaurant and their fresh chips and salsa usually need 3-4 refills before the food comes. :D  Their outdoor seating area is very nice.  Perfect spot to take your dinner date.  Very romantic lighting and heaters when the air gets chilly.  During the daytime, it's a very nice atmosphere to catch up with old friends or have a business lunch with a client.    I think it's better than Macayo's, Serrano's, and other 'chain/many location' Mexican food places.  The owners keep an eye out for the quality of food they serve here and the always packed parking lot speaks for itself.

I had no idea this place existed until last night.   I went to ASU and I lived in the East Valley forever so I've tried all the great pho places there.  I also worked in Phoenix, so I've tried all of the Vietnamese places there also.   However, this hidden gem right off of downtown Glendale takes the cake! The food is great and the ambience/atmosphere can't be beat!   This place makes all the other places look like dumps!  We usually let them get away with that because the food is so good, but this place doesn't let only their food speak for themselves!  It is a small house converted into a restaurant, so they have little rooms all over, giving you a nice cozy feeling.  They also have a huge fish tank with huuuuuuge goldfish and koi.  The little ones were all over the tank.  Now to the food! I went with a girl and her almost  2 yr. old baby, and we ordered the gamut of typical Vietnamese fare ordered at an establishment.  Pho with combination of meats, Egg Rolls, Spring Rolls, and the Pork chop with rice entreé with fried egg.  Everything was delicious.  If I wanted to nitpick, the peanut sauce wasn't very good and the egg rolls very pretty petite.  The spring rolls ended up being dipped rest of the way in the sweet fish sauce and the obviously homemade egg rolls made up in flavor what they lacked in size.  Even the very picky baby gobbled them up!  She usually never eats anything but she was pigging out here!  It was pretty chilly at night so we had the hot tea and the jasmine tea was very good as well.    The pho was HUUUUGE.  You usually have to order the large to get that size at other restaurants but this was their standard size.  The broth was very good and not overpowering.  The meat balls were very good, different from what all the other places seem to use.  Maybe they make their own??? They were missing the brisket, which usually is my favorite, because it has the flavorful chewy fat along the meat; and it seemed to be replaced with leaner but better quality slices.   One nitpick I have with the pho was that since the broth was so hot, it completely cooked the raw meats and I like my meat pretty rare.    Now that I think about it, I didn't really even look at the prices, I was too craving the pho and distracted with the baby. But with a thai boba iced tea, all of that came out a little for 40 dollars, so I would have to say it is a little more pricey than other Vietnamese restaurants, where I usually feel as if I've robbed them, eating so well for so little.    Until this last paragraph, I had this place at 5 stars... The price knocks of a star for a solid four.    A great place to take a date but just to get your pho-fix, its a little pricey!  Accepts credit cards for check above 8.99$.

Boo! Went with a big birthday group after confirming business hours. Got their well over 30 mins before their posted closing business time. Told us kitchen was already closed and turned us away! I would understand if it was a bar/sportsbar where they have last calls for kitchen food and a bar to operate later than their kitchen. If a restaurant has certain hours, I was always under the impression the kitchen is open until the closing time.  May take a while for me to want to come back here. Even tried to plead our case and it was a no go as the host sat there counting his money. Wow.

Five stars because:  1. Way cheaper than AMC, especially Westgate.  2. Seats are more comfortable, you're able to lean back much more comfortably 3. Souvenir cups and t-shirts make frequent movie going much more affordable!  4. Harkins is a family owned Arizona business. Let's keep it local! 5. Staff is great; always smiling.  6. Student price is still $5.50.

Very good.  This place is really good.  Why?  The owners are the sushi chefs.  They buy high quality ingredients.  How do I know?  I worked for the company that supplies them a few things they cook up and they do not mind paying for quality.  The owner is notorious for his belief that good ingredients are expensive for a reason.    A lot of sushi places buy precut and plastic packaged salmon, tuna, and other fish.  The owner/sushi chef buys whole fresh fish and filets them himself.  The beef they use here is very good also.  Certified Angus Beef, in fact.  They don't even advertise that fact.  They let the quality speak for themselves.  Everything is good but my favorite thing to have here is the cold soba/buckwheat noodles.  If you haven't had them before, make sure you try it here.  They will blow you away.  I think one time I've had two orders of it.  I just make sure to order it whenever I go.    When the owner has a passion for the food he serves, it's gotta be good.  I live an hour away from this place and I make it one of my top choices to go for good sushi and japanese cuisine.    Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

I've been to this location a few times as this is my "go-to-spot" while waiting to meet people from Craigslist to buy or sell something from people around Tempe.    I love the way they slice all the ingredients, the meats and the cheese right on the spot according to the sandwich you order.    They also hot sandwiches here and they don't nuke them in microwaves like they do at subway.  They have a grill!  Jersey Mike's is no-brainer over Subway any day!

Wanted to give a 1 star, but service was alright...  Don't know who came first, Texas Roadhouse or Logan's, but Logan's seem to be a blatant rip-off and a poor substitution for T.R.  First, the rolls came to the table with what seemed like a hair on the roll, right on top, buttered onto the roll.  The friend I went with freaked out; I looked carefully and saw it was synthetic, like a plastic or vinyl sliver.  I'm in the food business, stuff happens, I'd just brush it off, but friend was freaking out.  Sent it back, got new rolls and was informed it was the bristles from the butter brush.    Meats were all tough and definitely not for foodies.   Even after ordering mine medium-rare, closer to rare, the 16 oz ribeye I got was tough, dry, and flavorless.  Yes, it was overcooked and I didn't send it back, but I know meat and it wasn't good.  I can't remember the time I brought back an entire steak for my dogs.    I'd recommend going to Texas Roadhouse if you want that mid-entry level steak with the roadhouse atmosphere.

I've been coming here since my business is across the street.  Nothing special here sets it apart from other Best Buys, positively or negatively.  I like how most of the employees now have walkie-talkies so they don't have to run around looking for answers if they don't know what I'm asking them for.    I went there last night and I was surprised to find a very good selection of whatever it is your looking for, whether it be e-Readers, cellphones, or cameras.  They also claim to have the most laptops under one roof, so if you're in the market for one, it wouldn't be a bad idea to stop by a Best Buy.    One extra star on top of an A-Ok because one thing I do like about Best Buy is that if you buy lot of games or electronics, you accrue a lot of Reward Zone points and in turn Rewards bucks.  I cashed in 145 dollars worth of stuff last night.  I'm only a Silver member, and Best Buy is really good about sending you real offers and member-exclusive events.  So far I've been given chances to go see the last Twilight movie that came out as a private screening and several private sales they have just for the members.

I go to Lifetime Fitness on my own, however, I found my weight loss goals on a plateau even though I was doing cardio twice a day!    I've seen this place since it's close to some of my favorite restaurants; Nobuo at Teeter House, PIzzaria Bianco, etc...    I read about them online and I saw that many people had only great things to say about them.  They were correct!  I've only been here three times total; once to sign-up and twice to workout.  The staff already knows me by my name!  They are incredibly helpful, friendly, and they genuinely care.  I've had personal trainers before but they don't compare to the staff here!    They have  free class at 9 AM on Saturdays if you want to check it out at no risk to you.  You have nothing to lose!  Come check them out!  I've already recommended them to so many people I think this Saturday morning may be packed!

Still loving this place and I can't stop recommending it to everyone I meet!  I've gone at least twice a week, sometimes 3 times a week depending on how sore I am.    Soooo awesome.  You feel awesome after every workout and so sore the next day!  But that's what you want!    I still have no idea what everyone's name is here but everyone knows mine!  They're always encouraging each other and looking out for you.   I'm always looking forward to my next session!

This place is the cleanest Asian-grocery in the East Valley.  It's mostly Korean food items with some Chinese and Japanese stuff thrown in the mix.   You CANNOT beat the meat section; they specialize in Korean and Asian-cuts you cannot find anywhere else.  This is because they will cut anything for you fresh on the spot.  L.A. Galbi (Ribs), Wang Galbi, Sam GyupSal (Pork Belly), and more all cut to your liking.   They also have a Korean snack-bar/food stand where they specialize in Korean fast food.  I've tried their Kimbap (Korean roll similar to sushi but nothing raw) and DdukBokkee (Sweet Rice sticks in spicy sauce), and it's really really good.   Oh, and they have a relationship with the Liquor store that's in the same plaza where they sell Soju (Korean rice wine)!!!!!!!!!! Fresh or marinated meats, fresh vegetables, and Soju!?!?!?!  Time for a Korean bbq!

I forgot to mention their meat is so fresh you can get Steak Tartare!  You can also have the lady at the food counter prepare it for you.  OMG  If you haven't tried Korean Steak Tartare(Yook Hwae), you're missing out!

Great food and really cheap.   I've been coming here since 2000 back when I was at ASU, and it's still the top spot for Pho for me in the Valley of the Sun.  Here's one of my latest pig outs as I remember it.  Keep in mind I went with one other person.  3 coconuts (the guy will crack open the top and insert straw & spoon for you) Other places give you coconut juice from the bottle and add coconut meat(?) to it.  *ahem* Da Vang *ahem*  If you've never had fresh coconut before, now is the time.  Natural Gatorade & oh so much better for you.  Plus, you can scrape the meat off the sides with your straw and suck them into your mouth.  Yes, you may use the spoon also, but it's not as fun. :D  2 orders of #11, the obligatory combination Pho. Need I say more?    1 Bahn Mi with combination meats Their Bahn Mi is awesome!  They've changed it up a bit, and for the better!  They used to have thin slices of pickled daikon and carrot, but now they have big sticks of them in the sandwich.  Order one with your Pho.  You can dip the fresh french roll right into the soup and chomp down on the combination of Vietnamese sandwich meats at their finest.    1 order of spring rolls I like how their rolls taste always fresh, not like how they seemed to have been rolled and kept in the fridge.  I think the very high turn over rate they have here helps  1 order of egg rolls.  All that came out to 25 dollars and something cents! I actually misunderstood the cashier and thought he had said forty five, but considering the amount of food we had at the table, I didn't even question it.  But seeing the number total on the register hit me as I was surprised it was so cheap!  I've had their pork chop w/egg rice plates as well, and they're an awesome option for people who do not like the so-called "smell or scent" of Pho.    PS:  Vietnamese restaurants usually all close on Tuesdays.   It's pretty smart since it really IS the slowest day for restaurants.

Please don't judge this place by the "I'm entitled to everything because I'm the customer and the customer is always right" mentality, because the ladies don't give a crap.  If you're hungry, they'll feed you.  If you're looking for the royal treatment, go somewhere else.    This place reminds me of a lot of the restaurants in Korea, where ahjumma's () take your order and treat you like a niece or nephew.  At least they bring you water; a lot of places in Korea are self-service.    In that regards, I can say this place is the most authentic Korean restaurant in the state.   Also, they're open until like 2 AM.  Hell yes.    Most of the food is great.  I'm Korean, and I've tried most of everything on the menu.   Yes, their kimchee-jjigae is made differently than my moms, but it's still tasty as hell.   So are a lot of the other dishes and banchans.  You can't expect the same style of Korean food in every restaurants, considering even in the tiny country of Korea, there's an estimated 200 types of kimchee.  That's not accounting for how each family makes theirs a little differently.  I'll give you a quick rundown of all the dishes I can remember.  Sullung-tang(/):  The one soup I was disappointed with here.  The broth is weak and not very flavorful.  It's so simple and yet so difficult to get this soup right.  It's no wonder there are many restaurants in Korea that specialize in this one soup only.    Galbi-tang():  My go-to soup.  OMG this soup is good.  Go have some and thank me later.  Best combo bite with this: put your rice in the soup.  Get a spoonful of soup and rice and then place a nice fermented piece of kimchee/ggahkdugi on top.  Then place in mouth.  Chew and moan.  Repeat.  Shrimp gganpoongi ():  Every person I've taken to this place has loved this.  So much pepper and garlic on it, and yet so good.  They don't skimp out on the shrimp nor the quality/size of the shrimp they use.  Worth every penny.  Don't get as a main dish because that's weird.  Order one for the table and share.    Ddukbok-i ():  I order this without fail every time I go as the standard starting dish.   It's slightly different every time, because it's actually cooked here with fresh veggies and peppers.  So so good.  Again, order this as something to share with your loved ones, ordering it as a main dish is weird.  dolsot galbi bibimbap ():  This sizzling bowl of rice with assorted veggies and rib meat is amazing.  See the red ketchup bottle she gives you?  It's not ketchup.  It's magical pepper paste sauce.  Squeeze a pretty pattern on your bowl and mix.  Borrow your neighbors spoon.  It's easier.  Just give them the spoon back full, not empty.    soon dae guk ():  Pork blood sausage soup.  The sausage isn't homemade, but I don't expect it to be.  It'll do to satisfy my craving for it while I'm away from Korea.  The soup?  Amazeballs.  Fresh perilla leaves with roasted seeds gives this soup a new taste you've probably never tasted before.     Jjam-bbong():  It's never been my choice, since I've always been on the Jjajangmyun () side of the Jjajang or Jjambbong (  ?) choice.   Huuuge portions though, and everyone I've seen that ordered it loves it.  If you love seafood and noodles, this is for you.  Jjajangmyun (): I've tried this once and didn't really care for it.  Not bad but not amazing like some of the dishes I've reviewed above.  Another reason many restaurants in Korea specialize in this dish.  It's the #1 delivery food in Korea.    Jaeyook-bokkeum ():  stir-fried well-ripened kimchee and pork-belly pieces are a little sweet for my taste but still very good.  One downside, they are very stingy with the meat in this dish.  You've got to go fishing around for it and there's not much to go around.  I've ordered this 2-3 times and it hasn't changed.    Final word:  The Korean law of "Jung" () dictates that when you go enough to be a regular and develop a likable relationship with the staff, the number and amount of premium side dishes and meat chunks in your galbi-tang or fish cakes in your ddukbok-i doubles.  Edited:  I typed in all the Korean in parentheses, but I guess yelp doesn't support it.

I agree with Carlin about Maggie's review. Come on. There is a huge sign outside that states it is not open to the public. There is a reason their motto is: "Where Restaurants Shop." Restaurant Depot fills the niche, right between distributors and Costco/Sam's Club. I haven't had any rude experiences or bad service here and I've been coming here ever since it has been open.

Yea, I'm giving this Denny's 5 stars.  It's just that you cannot beat them for what they do best.  Late night food.   I mean, I don't know anyone that goes to Denny's just to go to eat at Denny's.  It's usually a toss up between IHOP, Denny's, and Waffle House.   However, Denny's food is realllllly good now!  I did hear about them revamping their menu and really working on improving their food and believe me when I say they did a really good job. Everything I've had recently was very tasty.   Their nachos and cheese fries have this new cheese sauce that isn't the typical Sysco or US Food Service one.  Their fries are a cross between a waffle cut and steak fry, again, never before seen anywhere else.    Give Denny's a chance and try out their new food!

Their chicken sandwiches really are the best. Even though you get this incredibly thick piece of chicken breast, its perfectly juicy and tender. I read somewhere it's due to them being fried in a pressure vat(?). I have no way of knowing buy nevertheless it white meat like you've never had. Also, get their "Chick-Fil-A" sauce. It's the perfect blend of ketchup, barbecue, and honey mustard. Once you try it, you'll never want to dip their awesome waffle fries into anything else!

I don't know how people complain about the prices when this is the premier "chain" gym in the entire state of Arizona.    You get what you pay for, especially with the facilities and cleanliness.   Cheaper gyms don't have towel service nor squeeky clean showers that LIfetime has.  I've been a member since they first came into Arizona way back when.  I lived in the East Valley so I was a member at the Gilbert location and sometimes frequented the Chandler one, next to Ikea.  What's very interesting is that even though Lifetime is a huge national chain, all their locations vary on layout and what they offer.    Also, they are open 24/7.  This is one of the main reasons I'm a member here.  I think they're one of the only ones open 24/7.  I sometimes go to work out after midnight and I like having the option to do so.  It's a trip when you go to a different Lifetime, especially if the floor plan is the opposite of what you're used to!   I know the Tempe/Chandler location has tanning beds, which I wish the Goodyear location had.    There are a lot of group classes available as well as very good child care.  If you take advantage of all that they have to offer, it is NOT expensive.    Also, the sales people are to the point.  They are not like Bally or LA Fitness where they try to give you a "deal" by giving you a year or two worth of membership, so they can literally take all the money from you up front.  I know so many people who have prepaid for their gym memberships and never go!    Lifetime is month by month so you can quit or place your account on hold.    Best "large" gym in Arizona!

I've been giving so many five stars lately, so I was really hesitant to give Nobuo five stars.    But I can't help it I only really feel like reviewing a place unless they're really good or really bad... lol    My sister, who is Yelp! Elite in Los Angeles was in town visiting and wanted to try them out.  I actually had no idea this was the guy that had See Saw in Downtown Scottsdale, and that the guy had won the prestigious James Beard award...  The place is very cool, as it is in a historic house, in Heritage Square.  It's literally across the walkway from Pizzaria Bianco.  It's literally a house inside, so every room has a different ambiance and feel to it.  Even the bathroom is cool because it feels like you're a guest at someone's house!  My sister and I weren't too hungry but we ordered a lot of things because we're both crazy foodies!  The two things that stand out the most in my memory is the Warm Duck Salad and the Coconut Curry Lamb... OMG  I've never had duck or lamb that was sooooo nicely prepared.  They were both seasoned perfectly.  The duck had no hint of gaminess and I actually thought they had brought out the wrong entreé!  I thought it was beef tenderloin!  It looked and tasted like very very good quality tenderloin.    The lamb had just enough fattiness and the seasoning complimented the meat nicely, getting rid of the unique gaminess lamb usually has.  This means the meat was incredibly high quality and incredibly fresh.  It was cooked very rare, which is how it is supposed to be!  I'm craving some more now!    The other dishes were okay, nothing really special.  12 dollars for two spoons with Kumamoto oysters with tiny leaf of uni in tomato water...  Meh.  Couldn't taste the uni and tomato water tasted like the stuff that comes out of the ketchup bottle when you don't shake it before squeezing.    The Nasu Bacon Miso was very salty.  For the size of the eggplant, they put wayyy too much miso paste on it... Every bite equaled a gulp of water.    We should have tried the pork buns but we didn't and I opted to try their tuna sashimi... It wasn't anything special.    Overall, the entire experience was very unique.  From the atmosphere to a menu you don't normally find in a typical Japanese restaurant.  And, who knew the proteins would be so well prepared!  I was actually disappointed with sushi and seafood dishes and incredibly impressed with the meats!  :D

I just realized I've been going to this place since 2011 and haven't updated! This restaurant is now my "go-to" place for a foodie binge.    Since the wait at Pizzeria Bianco is usually a while, we usually head over here for a few nibbles before heading back for the pizza.  However... the few nibbles always usually mean 6-7 dishes.  Yes, some items they have are small but we always get the fois gras, the duck salad, and the lamb... Which are more like entrees.  Not to mention usually the pork belly rice... the last two are usually whatever sushi/sashimi special they have on the menu.  The food here is so good and so consistent.  I've actually been so inspired as to constantly try and recreate the food here at home or at work.

Never knew this place existed until a friend introduced it to me... On the night of my "birthday" gathering!   Wow!  Very cool place in Phoenix!  Who knew!   We went fairly late after hitting Sens in Downtown PHX, so we didn't have a chance to bowl too much, but it was a place everyone enjoyed and said "we need to do this again!"    They have a bar, which seemed decently priced, 7-8 dollars for Vodka/Redbull and 14 dollars for a bucket of Millers, I believed included 5 longnecks.    Go check it out!

I was pretty excited to try Five Guys after reading up on the buzz all over the 'net.  Zagat is practially in bed with 'em and practically every town/city newspaper thinks they're the next best thing, according to their decor.  What I mean is that their place is literally plastered with praises given to Five Guys by different publications.  As I stood waiting for my food, I really came to hate their decor.  I can understand "Best of Phoenix" plaques and maybe a framed newspaper review, but every inch of the place covered with quotes of how great their food was... kind of made me a hater.  I missed In-N-Out.  Maybe it was because it was so hyped, but I was seriously underwhelmed by their food.  I paid over twelve dollars for a bacon cheeseburger, smallest fries, and smallest drink.  I started to doubt the quotes on the walls since "Best Value" seemed to be the wording on several of them.  Now, the burger.  Let me start out by saying I really really really like burgers.... I can't really say this or that place is best, because I seriously like alllll of them.  Whether it be the super-processed flavor of McDonald's to the flamed-broiled goodness that is Burger King, or even the super fresh taste of In-N-Out,  I love burgers.  I love how not every burger tastes the same.  I looove burgers.  I don't think there has been a burger I haven't finished.  However, I literally had a moment to myself where I thought to myself I didn't want to finish this.  It was a fleeting thought, but that shocked me.  It was that tasteless.   Whenever I create an opinion on ANYTHING, I like to do the research and try it out before creating my own.  Every single bite, I was trying to find the great-awesome-spectacular-best-of-(insert city)-awesome-value-better-than-In-N-Out-burger taste everyone was talking about on the 'net.  I could not find it.  T.T  I ordered it with "Everything" and everything was bleh.    But don't hate me.  Like I said, I really like to do the research and try things out before I cement my opinion on something.  Sooooooo, I'm giving Five Guys 1 Star this time around for their underwhelming, super-overpriced burger.  However, I will go back once or twice because I love burgers and I like to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Maybe the guy behind the grill forgot to season my patty?  Maybe my tastebuds took the day off?  Stay tuned for my updated review of Five Guys!

This place started out well when it opened.. But they start doing what all other new buffett places do, by starting to "cut back" by not preparing fresh food as often, and restocking less often, especially for their "costlier" items.    Lin's down the street, on the other hand, do a great job of keep their standards up!  Hence the lines out the door whenever you drive by!

I think Seoul Jung, which was the restaurant I believe was here was two restaurants ago, had the best food.   For Seoul Korean Grill, they've updated the place so it looks modern and have gotten rid of the mediocre sushi because Americanized sushi really doesn't have a place in Korean food.    I took a friend and her two kids to introduce them to Korean BBQ.  We ordered the marinated ribs and chadol (brisket).   We also ordered the pancakes and seafood soondoobu soup.    The side dishes weren't very good, no one touched theirs after tasting them.    The chadol was pretty bland, but that's always a hit and miss wherever, unless you're in LA and everyone really does use Angus beef.    The marinated ribs were supposed to be my savior but they were overly marinated in what tasted honestly like beef jerky marinade.  The used so much tenderizer, usually pear juice, that the meat lost all sense of what natural beef is supposed to feel like in your mouth.  They all felt like moist teriyaki beef jerky in your mouth.  Also, the grill doesn't get hot enough to char the meat or the marinate.  Therefore the grilled flavor is missing; which I think is an important piece.  Another important piece missing from the table were the lettuce.  Nothing to wrap the meat in before popping them in your mouth.  They were also missing the shredded green onion "salad" that usually accompany Korean BBQ.  You add it with the meat, ssam jang, and rice into your lettuce before trying to stuff it all down your throat.    It's all very overpriced, so if you're feeling like mediocre Korean food in a nice, clean, modern atmosphere....  Seoul Korean Grill is for you!

I've been way to generous with my reviews and I've made up my mind not to give five stars unless everything was impeccable.    I REALLY LOVED The Arrogant Butcher.   I picked up a menu that was on a side table at my gym, of all places.   I've looked at it for a week before finally giving in and going.  I had a lot of carbs that night, but it was worth it!  It's good when a restaurant takes you to another place, and AB did that for me.  For a while, I forgot I was in Arizona and thought I was back in Spain with friends.  The build your own appetizer concept is cool.  Just like a sushi menu, you mark off what cheeses, charcuterie meats, cold veggies, raw bar items you want and they bring them out with sides of breads, spreads, and sauces. ALL SUBLIME!  You can taste the freshness of the ingredients and their attention to quality.  Hard to get good cured meats here and I'm already trying to plan my next outing to AB to get my plate of salumi and proscuitto on!  We ordered those meats, grilled asparagus, grilled mushrooms, giant white shrimp, oysters, heavenly pretzel bites with provolone fondue, marcona almonds, and a type of sheep's milk cheese very similar to manchego.  My date and I were in heaven!   Near the end we ended up making these little sandwiches by splitting the pretzel bite, spreading the fondue on one side, slice of cheese, cut up mushrooms and asparagus, and a pile of proscuitto or salumi...  ........ I couldn't stop smiling and we enjoyed ourselves so much because the food was so good!  Great conversation while nibbling on this stuff... Awesome night!    The only disappointment were the entreés... Maybe because we liked the appetizers so much we didn't feel the entreés?  I had the bolognese and my date at the sweet potato tortellis...  They were both good, but nothing to write home about.

Having a sushi background as well as owning a Japanese restaurants, AND reading the reviews on Yelp, I was prepared to be disappointed.    However, I was pleasantly surprised as each bite of each course was very very very good.  Date and I could not stop talking about how good everything was.  The only cons I have are:  Out of the seven courses, shrimp/prawn was present in four out of the six or seven courses. The last one being a dessert, that's more than half. They were all delicious, especially the nigiri, but it seemed like they were taking the easy way out? Hard to make really fresh shrimp/prawns taste bad IMO.  Also, don't expect a "Jiro Dreams of Sushi" type omakase; only one out of all the courses was nigiri. Don't get me wrong, it was a nice variety of Japanese entreés. I personally would have liked it to be more sashimi and nigiri intensive.     That being said, I was ready to go every week but from seeing pictures and reviews posted here, a lot of what is given as omakase seems to be the same. I am not entirely sure, but I did not want the exact same omakase the week after my visit. Am I being weird?     Even after all these slight personal gripes of mine, I can still say it was the best meal I've had in Arizona and I've been here since 1997.  Oh, and $125 for the omakase is not a bad deal, considering how many courses and different bites you are getting.  Same meal in LA or NY would cost you at least double.

Went today and invited a few of my friends to join me in an epic meal.  This time, I went to see if the food was consistent and to gauge how different the omakase was, a month later.    First of all, I want to say EVERYONE that I had with me loved it.  They unanimously agreed it was the best sushi they've ever had and the entire dinner was filled with sounds of Mmmms and Ohmahgawds.  I think some agreed it was the best meal they've had.    There were a few overlapping items for me, but it was different enough for me to be satisfied.    Consistency!  It was just as good as the first time!    This place makes every other sushi restaurant in Arizona seem like supermarket fare.    Finally, a few people may think it is too expensive for a meal.   Here's my take.  We had six courses with a dessert for a total of 7 courses.   The second course was six different small portions of completely different items.  If you're counting the six pieces of nigiri in course number 6, that is a lot of different dishes and items to prepare.  Osetra caviar, huuuuge pieces of fois gras, nigerian tiger prawn, giant clam, toro, Kumamoto oysters, black sea bass... were just a FEW of the ingredients in our long list of bites.  That is sooo worth 125$.    Best deal and best meal in Arizona.  Period.

Been here twice in the past two weeks. Once for my dad's birthday/cousin's graduation and another to introduce my significant other to fine sushi.   I'm glad they phased out several courses for new ones.  The food overall has gotten less mind-blowing in my opinion, but the reason I'm still giving it five stars is because of the attention of the staff there.   For my dad's birthday, we brought along our own cake and they offered to store it for us until our meal was over. Once it was, they brought it out with the candles lot and ready. They even took it back to cut it up for us. Great service. The staff also included a personally signed birthday card from energize. I thought it was an incredible gesture.   Last night, we were just a walk-in. However, the host remembered me by name and we were accommodated to be able to get the Chef's choice course without having had a 24 hour notice.   Consistently great food and service here.   Thanks, guys.

Similar to what other real customers have reviewed, the cupcakes were dry and nothing was really noticeable except for a lot of dye and color.  Let me mention now that they're pretty small.  I guess I'm used to gourmet cupcake stores having the "gourmet" size.  To compare, you need at least two of these to equal one of Sprinkles' cupcakes.  These were 3 dollars a piece.    They had eight flavors and I bought one of each.  When I got home, I tried four right off the bat (like I said, they're small).  All the frosting tasted the same to me.  The cakes were dry, probably because they've been out all day as I went in early evening.  They do not have display cases, they're just out in the open on one of those tiered displays they have at receptions.  Flavors were just.... sweet.   Nothing gourmet about these here.    3 dollars for a tiny cupcake with no distintive flavors other than 'sweet'. They do have signs for custom cakes, but with no pictures or portfolios for display from what I saw while in store, it's hard to wonder what their focus is on.  My guess is that it is a custom cake shop that makes cupcakes on the side to keep the cashflow going.   Maybe that's why their cupcakes are... eh?  PS:  No price point for 1/2 dozen.  3$ each or 29$ for a dozen.

Pretty much a simplified version of the original Johnny Rocket's menu.   Food is cooked to order, which is always fresh tasting.  Minus one for tiny teacup plates the burgers are served on.  The onion ring and french fry portions have been cut wayyy down; don't expect the same portioning you received when it was Johnny Rocket's.
