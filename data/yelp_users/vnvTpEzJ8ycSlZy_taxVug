Yaaay! I got a new tooth! I broke my tooth clear in half when I was younger by opening a car door into my face...then broke it again a few years later on a sugar daddy. God knows what happened this time, but my front tooth was chipped and I was looking like a member of the Cletus clan. Dr. Schneider explained everything he was doing right before doing it and was an absolute perfectionist. He got the shade to match dead on and also shaped my "new tooth" to look just like all the others. It was my first time at this dentist and I will definitely use them again! The space is modern and clean, the staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable. My tooth and I thank you Dr. S!

Let me preface this review by saying two things: 1. if there was an option for negative stars, I'd give it and 2. I just ate there about 20 minutes ago and am still feeling pissed off. My husband and I were in the mood for a good breakfast this morning, so we got to thinking...Matt's? Matt's is always awesome, but we didn't feel like waiting out in the rain for over an hour. The Original Pancake House? It's a close second so we opted for that and headed out. Once we got there, we realized 350 other people had the same idea as us and the wait would be about an hour. Not feeling like waiting, we hopped back in the car and jumped on our phones to check out what Yelp thought would be good nearby. Linda's was one of the places that popped up along our drive and we had both passed it a few times, always talking about wanting to try it. We looked at the reviews and there were lots of good ones raving about the food (Really? Guy who said it was Matt's with pie? Really? I don't know where the hell you get off, but I'm holding you partially responsible for totally jacking up my Sunday breakfast). We got inside and the place is a real shithole. I don't mind, because I typically love eating at shady looking places and drinking in dive bars. It's like a real "slice of life" type of thing and I find the experience usually excels where the decor is lacking. Everything was blue and mauve...I haven't seen this much mauve since the late 80's. And again, that would usually be fine, except in this case, it doesn't look like anyone has cleaned the place since then either. Everywhere I looked, things were grimy and just not...clean. We sat at the counter (first mistake) and both ordered the JJ's Special (second mistake). Sitting at the counter was like having a backstage pass to a Michael Bolton show...or some other really shitty person you would never want to see backstage. We could see the entire operation and hear the cook bitching the whole time. That's right, I said cook. Singular. One person working in the kitchen. She came out a few times to yell at our server, called Linda (I sincerely hope it was not the owner Linda). She looked like the grandma from Napolean Dynamite. For those of you that get the reference, enough said. We could hear the dinging of microwave ovens and the grumbling of Napolean Dynamite's grandma in the weeds with tickets that she couldn't read due to Linda's supposedly shitty handwriting. We waited over a half hour for our food. Granted, we didn't have to wait to sit but seriously, a half hour for eggs, bacon and pancakes. When the food came out I was already over it. I took one look at the plate and knew this was not going to be good. My "over-easy" egg had totally runny whites and looked more like a sunny-side-up gone wrong. My bacon looked like it came from Fry's and the pancakes were the only edible thing on my plate. I don't know if they were edible because everything else was so totally shitty or if it was because I am 9 months pregnant and would have eaten shit cakes at that point. Nevertheless, the ambiance combined with the service and the food made for the absolute worst $28 I've ever spent on breakfast. $28 dollars!! For me and my husband to have pancakes, eggs, bacon and coffee. That did NOT include toast or potatoes and half the plate was inedible. It makes my blood boil just thinking of it and as I sit here writing, I am still starving. We should have just gone to the brass rail. Better service, better food quality (I am not joking) and it would have been $5.50 a person for the same meal. You fooled me once Linda. Shame on me. You won't be fooling me again!

Guys. Seriously? This place is not living up to the hype. My husband and I went here for an overnight stay to celebrate the fact that it was our first time away from our kids, um ever in two years (no big deal) and it was a Father's Day gift. We had booked through hotels.com and relayed the importance of our visit in the reservation. I upgraded the room to a private casita and chose the option to pay at the time of the booking, as opposed to paying later.  Imagine my surprise when, upon check-in, I am confronted immediately with,"we need a credit card for this reservation".  "I thought I paid ahead, but ok...."  The front desk attendant then informs us of the $30 resort fee and $15 overnight parking fee. Really? Y'all can't even spring for free parking for your patrons? At a so-called 4.5 star resort? Please.  The valet gave us a tour of the grounds and he was great. Informative, funny and honest. When we tipped him he made sure we knew that a tip was already included and wasn't necessary. We knew but he deserved the tip anyway, it was just nice of him to be honest.  The stay was nice, the room was fine and dinner was good-but for a $250 check for two people I was expecting more. But what was really great happened next. Once we got home a few days passed and I spoke to my mom. She said she was surprised she didn't hear from me for a big thank you. I asked why? Well it turned out my parents paid for our stay as a nice gesture since we never get out. Odd, I thought, considering the first thing the front desk attendant did was ask for a credit card when my parents sent their info in and wanted to pay for any other incidentals above and beyond the room. I called and talked to the front desk attendant and told her the deal. She didn't sympathize, she didn't apologize, she just transferred me to the accounting department to leave a message. The following day, Eric from accounting called me back. We figured out that my card wasn't charged but there was a $300 hold on my debit that would "disappear in a week or so". Now, I don't have a lot of money, so for $300 to be tied up for a week was kind of a bummer. He keep repeating the same info about booking through hotels.com and how sometimes people who pay for rooms want to remain anonymous (I was asking why I wasn't told the room was paid for, why was I even asked to present a card when that part was handled?). He was droning on and I said, "I don't care about that, what I care about is..." I couldn't finish my sentence because Eric from accounting interrupted me and said that if I didn't care what he was saying he couldn't help me any further. Then he HUNG UP ON ME! I mean come on! Where's the hospitality? I was furious. I wanted to be done with the shitty ordeal but my friend persuaded me to call again and let management know what happened. So I did. I told her that I didn't want anything from them, that I simply would never come back. She assured me that she would take this higher and have it corrected. With all the awesome deals in the valley during the summer why throw it away on this place? Spend your hard earned money some place else.

China King, you are my new man. To those fools who have given them anything but 5 stars, I say you must have ordered off of the gringo menu.   I lived in Chandler, where Olive Garden, Outback and Chili's are considered "good eatin". Sacrilegious is what I call it. My dining mate was wary of Chinese, the way most people are, because you are never really sure of what you're getting. I am so happy I tried this place. I went back three times in one week for more. I LOVE IT!!  The first time I went in for dinner, I was taken aback by all the Chinese people eating there. Think back to every Chinese place you've been. Have you ever seen any kind of Asian person in there (other than the ones working)? Chances are, the answer is no. This place was PACKED. We were handed menus with about 8 items on it. It's your typical General Tso's Chicken, Sesame Chicken, etc...I looked around at what everyone else was eating and it did not look like "typical" Chinese food. So I said to the waiter- "what are they eating?" He said something back that I didn't understand, then he disappeared. My mate looked nervous and asked what I just got us into. Who cares! It can't be that bad!!  When the waiter returned, he had a menu that was about 5 pages long with pictures of delicious looking treats. We told the waiter that we liked duck, fish, noodles (and a bunch of other random things) and to just bring whatever was best. We got a half duck as an appetizer that was melt-in-your-mouth good. Crispy skin and tender meat, exactly how it should be. For entree, we got a whole fish and some crispy noodles. We even got some Chinese beer. Dessert was sketchy, but then again, it was free so who can complain??   The other times I went, I had the BBQ pork, the sizzling chicken plate, and some other delicious items I can't recall or pronounce. I also went back for lunch and had the Dim Sum. I almost think I should write a separate review for the lunch because it was that good. I mean, really people just coming around with the BEST food ever asking if I want to try it. You're damn right I do. And don't stray too far, because I'll want seconds.  All in all, the most amazing Chinese food in a casual setting with very reasonable prices. The staff is super friendly and efficient. Also, there was some Chinese type "Idol" on TV and I felt very authentic being there, like I would step outside and be on a busy street with open air markets and people serving fried grasshopper. Instead, I walked outside and saw the glaring neon lights of the adjacent Boston Market. Oh Chandler. Does Boston Market even know that it is in the presence of greatness? Bow to the King.  On a last note...what is up with these people who write glowing reviews and only give 4 stars?? What do you want them to do, wipe your ass, too? Give China King the comeuppance it deserves!!!!

I have been growing my hair out for about two years and made the decision to cut it all off recently. I had an idea of what I wanted in my mind but didn't have a picture to show as an example. I did a pretty shitty job of relaying the image but somehow Alex understood and delivered an awesome cut. I am so happy with the results-no regrets!! As a huge bonus, Alex takes the time to show you cool tricks to style your hair and do it yourself at home. All her products are natural, non- toxic and a lot of them are even safe to eat:) if you have kids, you don't have to worry about bringing them and having them inhale those toxic products because everything is super safe and gentle.  Bottom line, this is an awesome salon in central/downtown Phoenix, all natural products and a hairstylist that takes the time and listens! Alex is great, go and see her!

I went to Down Under the other night with my boyfriend for our date night. We've worked in the service industry for years so we hold the bar pretty high on food and service. We ordered a cheese plate, the Barramundi and some wine.  When the cheese plate came out I almost laughed. Everything on there that wasn't cheese clearly came from a can and the cheeses looked like the ones you can buy pre-cut from Fry's or wherever. Fry's cheese plate may actually be a cut above what we received.  After the blasphemy that was our cheese plate, we were both a little nervous to see the Barramundi. Barramundi is supposed to be a tender, flaky, white fish. What we got was a sad piece of ocean chum that looked like it came out of a microwave. To say it was bad isn't saying enough. It was totally devoid of texture and taste.  To round out the evening, our wines (and the selection of wines) were mediocre at best and the service was not worth mentioning.  All in all, this was the most disappointing dining experience and waste of $75 that I've ever spent since moving to Arizona.

Picture this: It's early, you're cranky, you haven't had any coffee yet. Somehow, before heading to work, you find yourself on a gurney with no pants on. That was my morning.  I headed to Rio this morning to get a Brazilian. Not the most peaceful start to a day. Sara was my esthetician and she was beyond amazing. She was gentle, efficient and absolutely hysterical. She kept me laughing throughout my 45 minutes of genital torture. I almost forgot why I had no pants on and a woman between my legs...that's how much fun we were having!  Sara is a total pro and a perfectionist. She made the whole process feel natural and not-so-awkward. Which, believe me, is hard to do when you're face deep in...well, you know.  I'll be back to Rio! Sara is a true gem!!

If there was an option for 6 stars, I'd give it. This place is beyond great; from atmosphere and service, to drinks and food.   I have been meaning to write about Citizen's for a month now. I find that it's a breath of fresh air in a field of farts. Old Town had become so....well, old and it leaves a lot to be desired in the way of "classy joints". This is a perfect marriage of class and fun; I'd say laid back elegance, if you will.  The interior decor is such a drastic difference from the old Club "Next". It's sleek, modern yet comfortable, great bar space and patio and even rooms for private parties. I love the fresh flowers and candles.   I went with a girlfriend of mine and we sat at the bar. We started off with two specialty cocktails. I don't recall the names but one had cucumber and the other had freshly brewed tea in it. They were complex, fresh and most importantly, STRONG. Richie the bar manager took great care of us. He created their drink menu which is accessible but exotic. He is super knowledgeable and friendly. 2 things you need in a bartender. He's easy on the eyes too, so that helps.  For dinner, we shared the pork belly pastrami appetizer, chopped salad and scallops entree. Everything from start to finish was fantastic-you could taste and see Chef Bernie's influence in every dish. Complex flavors yet still had a comfort food feel, which I loved. At the end of the meal, Chef Bernie came out and talked to us. We saw him talking to every table and spending some time with all the guests which is pretty impressive, considering we went within the first two weeks they opened. He is a goddamn genius. Also, easy on the eyes...  At the end of the meal, I went to the bathroom and may have had too much to drink because I dropped my phone in the toilet. Richie offered me his extra cell phone for a few days until I got a new one. Now THAT'S service!   This place is awesome and you can't help but love and support two of the coolest dudes doing some innovative things with food and booze. Go support your local rock stars!

I moved here 2 years ago from Philadelphia, where threading studios abound. When I got here I was nervous I wouldn't find anyone to keep up with my bushy brows. I tried another threading studio for a year-the woman was straight from India, so I just figured she knew her stuff. As time went by, I realized my brows were getting thinner and thinner...and scarier! That is when I left and found Bronze Boutique/BeautifEye Studios. Tori is great. She really listens to what you're looking for AND she delivers. My eye brows look great, I am almost back to normal.  If you've never been threaded, try it once. You'll be hooked!
