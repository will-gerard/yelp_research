Excellent food and service. They stay open till 9:30 pm and are very accommodating. We had almond chicken, chicken fried rice, beef broccoli, and sweet & sour chicken. We all enjoyed our meal. I recommend this place to eat.

Good food. Good view and good service. Had dinner outside and had a nice view if the white tank mountain.  I had the Guinness meet and mushroom pie and it was well worth the wait for the crust to cook.

They serve really large portions. The service is amazing, the waitress was very attentive. We had the mix grill for four, hummus, and kibbe and there was so much food we had to take some home. I highly recommend this amazing restaurant. On the weekends they have salsa dancing.

Playing Bingo at Harrahs is fun. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. There are pictures of some winners but all the pictures are from 2012 and a couple from early 2013. Surly people have won some jackpots since 2012 & 2013. They should update the winners pictures. All in all it's a fun place to play bingo.

The food was taste but was cold. The service wasn't very good. They didn't check back to see if we wanted anything until we were almost finished eating. We would have had soy sauce, it want on the table. We couldn't get the servers attention to ask for anything don't  think I'll be back.

The burgers are fresh  and messy and taste great!!  They give lots of fries and the service is excellent, fast, and friendly. The cashier suggested the munchie burger and it was an excellent suggestion.

Excellent food and service. The portion size were large and the price was reasonable. The atmosphere was quiet and the place was spotless. I would recommend this place if you are looking for a casual and yummy place to have excellent Chineese food. I will come back here again.

I went through the the drive through and paid with a $20 bill. The cashier rang it us as a $10 bill and gave me change for $10 and not $20. I tried to get her attention right away but she shut the drive through window and turned away from me and left the window. She came back with my order and I asked her for the rest of my change. She insisted I had given her a $10 bill and I insisted it was a $20 bill. She refused to budge so the manager came over and said he would have to count the cash in the drawer to see if it balanced. He assured me it balanced and I must have given the cashier a $10 and not a $20. I reinforced that I was certain I had handed her a $20 bill and not a $10. Since the line of cars was backing up and I had to get back to work I left disgruntled and without my change. After I got back to work I called the restaurant and insisted it was a $20 and they owed me the $10. I know exact what I had in my wallet and I know I gave a $20 for the food. I asked the manager (Andy) to take my number and call me after he balanced the cash drawer at the end of the day. He called and admitted the drawer was over by $10 and he would give me the money back. I had to go into the store the next day and ask for him. I went in the next day and he gave me back the $10 and then I left. What bothered me so much about this is the lack of customer service. The cashier should never have said I was wrong about the denomination I gave her. She should have left the $20 on the register and had it there to confirm the correct change. The manager should not have wasted my time by disputing the $10. We all make mistakes. He did the right thing by calling me and having me pick up the $10 owed me. If the manager were in top of his game he would have bent over backwards to make it right and offered me some kind of compensation for having to come back and pick up my change. He didn't offer me anything but the $10. This is terrible customer service. Had I been offered some compensation for my time and energy for being inconvenienced I would not be writing this review. Good good!!  Really??  Was it worth the $10 for calling a customer wrong and even after admitting fault and paying the customer back, the damage is done. I'll never go back. I don't care how good the food might be, if the management is quibbling over $10 and not trying to go out of their way to make it right then this place needs some education in customer service and public relations. Sorry El Pollo Loco, don't think I'll be back when there are other options. Thanks for realizing your mistake and paying me back what was mine. The old saying "the customer is always right" should be taught to your employees and management. My degree is in Hospitality Management and I know I could teach the management and employees something about customer relations. Funny how a simple little "coupon" or "free dish" would have prevented this review. I do not recommend this restaurant.

I took my parents for Father's Day on Monday, the day after Father's Day and we got there at 5 pm. There was a 30 minute wait because the place was busy. Once we were seated our server Adam waited on us right away. He made great suggestions and we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and the garlic cheese bread to start. The portions are huge so we ordered on entree of the Alfredo the dark pasta. Everything was FANTASTIC!!  The service was excellent. I recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a great place to eat.
