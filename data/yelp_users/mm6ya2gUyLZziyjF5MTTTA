I brought my cat there today to be shaved. I made the apt for 1:30. When I got there I was told that the woman who was supposed to groom my cat was across the way getting her hair colored. Originally I was told I would just wait for my cat, but now that the groomer was getting her hair colored, I had to leave my cat there until 3:00.  Now let me preface that my cat does not like to be groomed, to be fair. BUT when I got there, 2 other gals had my cat pinned down. My cats nail was bleeding because it was cut too short, and she had 3 other cuts on her. The groomer was yelling at my cat to "CUT IT OUT" because she was trying to get loose. Well, anyone that knows cats would know yelling at them is pointless and only upsets them more.  My cat then got very upset and peed on herself. My cat scratched or bit the groomer and she threw my cat in her cage, with one leg not even shaved, and said they were done. The groomer said she had to leave to get her hair color rinsed off (oh ya, I forgot to say all this was going on with the groomer having hair color on).  When I dropped her off, I left specific instruction NOT to cut her face hair. I don't like how it looks like a pom-pom, but she did cut it that way. The other gal that works there said she had told her not to do it and she did it anyway.  Needless to say, I will not bring my cat there again, I will bring her somewhere else to get her last leg shaved. It was so traumatic. For me and my cat.

Not a hoot. As a matter of fact, this was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. Service sucked, food sucked and the girls were not even that hooterific.   We were seating and waited about 10 mins for someone to take our drink order. It was very warm in there too. I know it is summer, but the fact that you are paying more for everything in Vegas should come with a cool down.  Once we got our food (took 25 mins), it was cold if it was supposed to be warm and visa versa. The wings were fatty and under-cooked. The salad was soggy  and not fresh. The french fries were cold and not crisp at all. It was all horrible. Then the waitress did not come back to see if everything was ok until 15 mins after our food came.  I will never go to another Hooters. Really over priced and not worth it in any way.

DSH&N is the best of the best. The owner, DeAnna, is not only the most talented nail tech I have ever had, but she is a conscientious professional and person.  DeAnna and the stylists are great to be around and great at what they do. The atmosphere is stylish and welcoming. I have been going to DSH&N before it even was DSH&N. I am lucky to be a client.   They are always up on the latest in the field and the glitter toes ROCK!

The food here is the best in the valley. The rice is to die for. The salads are huge and so tasty. The spices on the meats are mouth watering and the service is personable and excellent. Family owned and operated, we should support them!

This place was very little help to my son. They basically watched him detox and let him go. There is no long term goal for people that are not extremely sick or for people that have no money. Dont waste your time.

I have friends that rave obout this place so I decided to try it. I think I made a mistake on ordering a salad from the VSC. Dont get me wrong, it was very fresh and tasted good. It was just a whole lotta lettuce and not so much toppings. I ordered the Cobb and there was maybe the equilivant of 2 pieces of meat, not sure if the bacon bits were fresh or packaged, about 1/4 of an avacado, and a tablespoon of blue cheese crumbles. The homemade crouton were good and the salad dressing was excellant.   Now for a salad that cost over $7.00, that is just no right. Less lettuce and more protien would have been perfect.   But they were very friendly and the salad tasted good. Next time I will go with a sammich.

I just picked up 15 pieces of dry cleaning. It totaled $125. It would have been $140 without a coupon.   This is just ridiculous. I don't care what kind of service you claim to have, there is no reason for this.  I will not be back.

My husband and I love this place. It is great for people who want there food the way they want it! You customize your burger or salad from a check-sheet. We do low-carb so we have out burger or chicken put on a salad. It is PERFECT and yummy.  They bring a plate of fresh chips to you table while you wait. They are covered with Parmesan cheese. On the days we are carbin' it, we love them.   The service is great. We get the same server whenever she is there. I will have to get her name because she is fabulous.  They do have a happy hour on drinks and appetizers too.

Although we love this place, the fact they have raised their prices a lot will detour us from going as often. Also, they used to greet your table with a small plate of free home-made chips, now they charge for them.   I am just not sure if any burger is worth $10-$15.

If you are a douche bag-poser, this is your place. We were there Friday night. We were sitting in a booth for hours, spending our hard earned money. I went to the ladies room and when I came back, my party had been asked to move because the booth was reserved. THERE WAS NO RESERVED SIGN and no one, at any time in the evening told us it was reserved so we could choose to sit somewhere else. The posers that were now sitting in the booth, were they better than my party because they ordered a bottle of champagne?   Additionally, when the staff swooped in and cleared our table, they took a partial pitcher of beer and my friend had grabbed my purse and I did not see her do it. She went out side and I could not find my purse. That caused a big problem because I could not find it. I blew a gasket and the bouncers did not give a $hit that it was missing. When I did find it I apologized to them when I found it, but the whole thing could have been avoided if they "reserved" bullshit did not happen.   There were so many orange fake tans that it looked like an oompa loompa convention. And that was the dudes!! I agree the DJ was one of the worst I have ever heard. He had no idea how to read the crowd and was all over the place with no understandable transitions between song types. And I think the waitresses all shared on brain between them, and that is being generous. The service sucked.  I do have to give one shout out to a bouncer named Mark Wallace. He did try and rectify the situation by buying us beers to make up for the pitcher being taken. He listened to our complaints and someone should give him a promotion to lead bouncer or manager instead of the douche bag in the knit hat. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE

This place is amazing. We had the Reuben on the latke. BEST SANDWICH EVER. Do yourself a favor and eat it! Try the pickles and salads too. Service was great.
