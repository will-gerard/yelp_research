Carnitas Skillet awesome!! Pancakes awesome! It's pure awesomeness here.  Coffee is tasteful and perfect temp. Food is to die for! Nice place and not too crowded. Nice that it's hidden in the back behind Home Depot.

Had an awesome time! Went Memorial Day. I was impressed. Lines weren't that long. Place was clean. Food and drink a little on the expensive side. But you can expect that going in like with any amusement park. The sidewinder drive was definitely the ride with the most adrenaline. Wish there was a way to get the 4 person tubes up to the top of the slide easier. Overall it was a very pleasant experience.

Everything was awesome!  Great service! Great Food! Great people!  Pizza was tasty. Wings flavored just right!  Cheesecake and Canoli's were splendid!  Great environment , most importantly friendly staff!  We must all remember to support the mom and pop stores and step away from the subpar food and service at the big chain stores  The quality of the ingredients aren't even close to that of the big chains. They mass produce and prepare their food. The smaller places have to purchase in smaller quantities and use fresh daily prepared ingredients. Big difference  We were pleased . Keep up the good work!

Went here for my birthday. First time here not bad. Showed up at 4, I wouldn't recommend that. They clean the coal brick ovens between 4-5, so we hung out drinking for an hour. Overall pizza was ok. Next time maybe we try a different one other than the typical red sauce. Salad was good too!

this place is off the chain!, i love me some delicious chips and salsa! The street tacos were to die for :) The best thing about this place is the ambiance its truly fabulous. The wait staff and management was very accommodating. We have children and sometimes it can be difficult but not at this place, they love it!

Under no circumstances would I recommend doing business with this company we dropped off a deli case to these guys in the middle of May and we have repeatedly contacted them asking if they had a chance to look at it so we can get our money for it two months later they're saying they try to call us text us and all that . Straight lies!  They are very shady now they said the case does not work even though it worked when we dropped it off they never once try to call us   A month ago I even drop by because I was in the area and she's like oh we been really slammed we will try to move it to the front of the line and I will call as soon as I look at it that call never came now we call today to follow up and now they're saying we've been trying to reach you guys the case doesn't work and you need to come pick it up   Shady!!! Check out the Google reviews if you think I'm lying

Very friendly and very helpful  Had no experience with pools and they helped steer me in the right direction  Highly recommend them if you have  a pool.  Prices on chemicals seem reasonable too.

Giving a one star rating because It's 10am and we sat down at 930am It's eggs and pancakes not steak and lobster.   What the heck is taking so long??  The restaurant is only half full too. Glad it wasn't full.  Very disappointed.

Greatest Lunch Ever! Came in because of Groupon. We will be back. Waitress was fantastic and friendly. Bacon Cheeseburger was awesome! Met Justin one the owners he was nice and polite too.  Very relaxing, clean and enjoyable atmosphere. I recommend giving this place a try.  They have very affordable daily specials on food and beer. Lots of draft and bottle selections.

FANTASTIC!!! Very tasty, had the bacon eggs and potato in a burrito option. The fresh green and red salsa was great.  Fresh fruit was terrific too.  Ordered a couple oatmeal cookies and morning glory muffins to go. Those were great too! Highly recommend , you won't be disappointed. This place cooks up real food, not the fake stuff you get at McDonald's or those other fast food places We'll be back for sure! Thanks Gabriela!

My wife and I wanted to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary with style boy were we disappointed  We chose stock and stable because we had heard good things via word of mouth. The service was very forgettable, we sat the bar and were left alone for what seemed like forever before she acknowledged our existence..... I ordered the cheeseburger and it was less than tasty. Very well done not to my liking. My wife ordered the Arugula salad and was please with it.  Our drinks...... when they came ......I was again let down! I ordered the "some like it hot" and it wasn't very tasty. I was told it was a very popular drink,  maybe it's just me but I didn't care for it.  My wife's wine was fine.... Can't mess up wine I suppose....... All in all it was forgettable experience. I'll probably give this place one last shot , because I believe in second chances just ask my wife!
