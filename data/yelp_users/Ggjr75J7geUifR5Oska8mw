I had a couple of immigration questions and thought it might be best to seek for an actual legal advice than google. I went for this law office because it is closer to my place and they offer free legal advice. Secretary was very friendly. Office is a little bit old but not too bad. The attorney was about 30 minutes late and although was a little friendly, he wasn't really giving much information on my questions. It was just a yes or no answer and if I asked more, he will just give me one line answer. I guess that's what you get because it is free. I would have paid him if he showed a little more care on my situation.

Love coming back to this place. Servers are very friendly and service is pretty fast! Food is pretty decent. I always get steamed gyoza and tootsie roll!

My favorite nail salon by far and I have been to quite a few.  My favorites thus far: super friendly employees, all of them are very consistent in providing service, massage lasts a while which is awesome because they really take their time. The one thing I especially like is they have a 'stamp' program where you can get free eyebrows or upper lip waxing service. They said they will work with you if you aren't interested with the waxing services. They will just discount your next nail visit. That's pretty good promo because I haven't been to one nail salon that offer that reward program!

I have been to Good Egg numerous times and have never really been disappointed with the food. I have tried the benedict, breakfast tacos, traditional breakfast and crepes. They are all very good and super filling. Service is awesome and they are all super friendly. I rate them 4 instead of 5 because the service is a little slow, in my opinion. The wait is a little long than the most place I have been to. But overall, I still recommend this place. PS- they are actually switching the name to First Watch because they were bought by another company!

I am very surprised to see such extreme reviews at this Best Buy. I have started coming to this location last year and I've always had great experience. There was only, maybe, one time when I thought they were understaffed and only had one person checking us out but other than that, I've always had pleasant experience. Reps are helpful and friendly and are always around whenever I have a question on any of their products. My friend recently upgraded her phone and they helped her through the whole process! They transferred all the info from her previous phone to the new phone without a glitch. She couldn't stop raving about it. And I agree. Maybe in the past they've had bad customer service employees but that obviously is no longer the case.

Great place to eat brunch or lunch! They have lots of selection for salads, sandwiches and pasta. They have 'select two' option for people like me who wants half a sandwich and a salad or a soup. The servers are always friendly and helpful. The lady who took my order asked if I wanted some water while waiting for my takeout. Now that's nice!

No other movie theaters for me but this one from now on! Recliner seats + less crowd make this my go-to theater. They also have Rewards program, which I don't think Harkins or AMC offer at this time. I only give them 4 stars because their customer service is just 'meh'. I don't expect the concession people to be super, extremely, bouncing-off-the-walls-happy but at least smile when asked a question. Good thing it's just a quick transaction. But anyway, another cool thing about this place is you can purchase tickets ahead of time and choose your seats through Fandango. Keep in mind though that there is a $4.00 convenience fee charge.

This park has everything it seems like! I am from the east part of town and has come up twice to this complex to play tennis. They have basketball, tennis and racquet courts plus football, basefield and soccer fields. They keep their restroom pretty clean and I think they even have a store there where you can get something to eat if you get hungry. I've never been to a public sports complex like this that offers their amenities free! Too bad it's really far from me otherwise I will schedule all my tennis matches here!

If you're looking for a fresh fish in the valley, this is the place to go. We ordered salmon and Phoenix roll and both were super delicious. Ambience is great but the service... Not too thrilled. That's why I'm giving them a four. Our server was somewhat rude and a bit odd! He also screwed up the bill twice and said that it's because of their antiquated computer. I will still come back though and hope that we won't get him next time!

Been going to Crosswalk for about 2 years now and I just love the weekly messages. There's always something that you can take away and apply in your day-to-day because the messages are very practical. I love how Pastor Jeff, one of the teaching pastors, breakdown the bible verses to help you understand better. If you have been looking for a church for a long time or haven't been church for a while, I would highly recommend Crosswalk. Everyone is very friendly and you will feel right at home!

I frequent Starbucks quite a bit and I am really disappointed with this store, which is too bad because this is the closest Starbucks store next to my work! I might have to start going to a different location even if that means I have to drive a little bit further. Although some of the employees are somewhat friendly, I would say 3 out of 5 times, the employees are a little gruff. I understand that this is a busy store given the location but maybe they can be a bit consistent in their service. That might help us forgive them a little bit for being so slow. This is by far the slowest store ever that I've been in. I was there at 10am, morning rush is over, there are wasn't a bunch of people, and still the two drinks that I ordered took longer than it should be! So just a heads up to those reading this, if you have some free time to kill and you are in no rush, then you can go to this store but like most of us who doesn't have the time to spare, I will just find another Starbucks to go. There's one in every corner!

I went here on a Saturday evening with my brother and my friend and we had a great time singing our tunes for about an hour and 30 minutes. I must say that the time went by super quick! I have been looking for a private room karaoke here in Phoenix for a while now and I am glad I found this place.  The price was pretty decent for a small room at 6pm. Since it's not quite primetime just yet, we paid $27 an hour. Every minute after that is just about $1 (with tax). This place offers drinks and food which we did not partake since we just had dinner in Tempe Market Place. The service is pretty good and the host is friendly and knowledgeable. They answered all our questions and walked us through how to use the touchscreen to play our songs. The technology is super friendly and if you're used to Windows touchscreen technology then navigating their karaoke system won't be an issue!  I am giving my review 4 stars because I would like to see the most recent songs on their list. They said it could take months before it could added to their song list. If you want private room where your friends can just be themselves, dance the night away while singing and embarrassing themselves "privately" then this is the place to be! I will for sure be back and I will be bringing my fiancee!

I love their Sunday brunch. The burritos are super filling and just very yummy. I have a lot of food allergies and it's hard for me to find a place where I can really enjoy the food without suffering from it. This place just does that. Save some room for tsoynami or a donut!

Sometimes I wish I didn't know about this place because now I am obsessed with their Grilled Chicken Pita. It's just absolutely delicious! It's got to be the tzatziki sauce that makes the pita even more flavorful. If you are craving Greek food and looking for something new, you should check this place out! And be sure to come in hungry because they really stuff the pita with meat!

Absolutely love, love this place. From great customer service to quality food, there's nothing to complain about, really. Except maybe I wish there's membership to this place so I can just eat here every single night. If you are in a mood for an amazing vegan food, this is the place to be. If you're not really crazy about vegan food, this will make you want to change your diet and just be 24-Carrots fanatic like me! PS- don't forget to try their desserts because that will just make your experience even greater.

Ordered the breakfast tacos without cheese and it's delicious! I didnt want the beans that came with it as a side, the server offered fruits or potatoes instead. That was nice! Some servers won't do that. The atmosphere is very relaxing, the place looks polished and everyone was very friendly. It was a great time overall!

This gym opened sometime last year so everything is new, which is awesome! Enployees are super friendly at all times. I like the vibe and the culture they've created because members seem to have respect for each other because everyone and I mean everyone wipes the equipment after use. No other gym does that ever! You won't ever get intimidated coming here either! I would never go back to LA Fitness or any other gym, really. Planet Fitness has all that I need for a $20 membership. Oh and did I mention you can get a tan or a chair massage at the end of your workout?! Pretty awesome!!

This is one of my favorite Filipino joint in the valley. They just opened not too long ago and I am glad that they did. I am always in the mood for soul-satisfying Filipino dish and this place just hit the spot. The owner is super nice and sweet and reminds me so much of my mom, actually. We ordered Shanghai, which is the Filipino version of Spring Rolls and some Filipino desserts and we are left craving for some more. Will definitely be coming back in the near future. Probably after this post! Lol!
