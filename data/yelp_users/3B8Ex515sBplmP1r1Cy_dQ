Anytime I can find a $10 for $20 Groupon (which, thankfully, is frequently!) you'll see me here with the family.   The pizza doesn't appear to be anything special by appearance, but wow, it's absolutely deeee-lish!  My wife really enjoys their wings as well. Great flavor and texture. The reason I'm giving a 4 star review is because it isn't mind-blowingly fantastic, but it is definitely a yummy pizza pie.  And we haven't ever had a negative experience with the staff. They haven't been overly friendly or bubbly, but they've been very nice.  And an extra bonus for me is the big screen TV always tuned to whatever big game is currently on.

Pizzas here are second to none. Toppings are quality and heavy and freaking dee-lish. Just tried my first calzone from here and am pretty disappointed. I'm comparing it to the calzone I had at Buono's Pizza (Guadalupe and Dobson) which had ricotta cheese and was addictingly good. This calzone was filled primarily with a chewy cheese you'd normally find on top of a pizza and nothing else.   So to recap:  Pizza - amazing Service - fantastic Wait time - not bad at all Calzone - meh

Meh. The food/feel of Flavors reminded me of Denny's. The food was bland and the selection wasn't as vast as the other buffets we ate at. Felt like the dining area and food area could use an upgrade to feel more modern or fancy. The one positive I could think of was the cotton candy was delicious.   I'd recommend Paris for a better buffet with fantastic ambience.

We got the 24 hour buffet pass.  We ate at Paris, Planet Hollywood, and Harrah's.  Paris, hands down, was the best!!!  The ambience alone is worth the trip.  The other two reminded me of eating at an old country buffet or a Denny's. But Paris made you feel like you were in France.  The food was fantastic! We had the afternoon brunch and enjoyed made-to-order crepes, creme brûlée that was out of this world, and a couple pastas that were very good. We didn't get it, but you could get all-you-can-drink mimosas for $12 per person. And right now there is a Groupon 2 for one and a bottle of wine included for $30ish.    We loved eating at Paris, would definitely go back again.

Not too much to comment on about the food other than the meatballs are...you know...meatballs. You should know by this point if you like Subway or not. Take it for what it is.  The staff here is incredibly cool, though. Very friendly , good at getting the order right, and if you come in frequently enough and order the same thing, they'll even give you a cool nickname like, "Hey Mr. Meatball!".   Yeah, they're pretty cool here.

Amazing experience!. If the staff here had this much compassion over my guinea pig I know exactly who to take my dogs to when they need a Vet!. Dawn and her assistants made me feel at ease when making tough decisions regarding our pet.  They talked with me through all my options and sometimes, as pet owners, we need to do what is best for the animal and your family.  The staff here respected the choices we made and were extremely helpful helping me sort through my feelings, while they gave me time and presented all my options to me to help make that decision.

Words do no justice to how amazing the Machaca Beef Burrito is. Smother that bad boy in their Green Hatch Chili sauce and I am one very happy customer. If I get a water, I can get out of here for around $6, too, so it's not a heavy hit on the wallet. Their Chicken Quesadilla is amazing as well - loaded with cheese, seasoned chicken, onions, cilantro, and some other good stuff that I'm forgetting, and topped with sour cream and guacamole.   I've been here a dozen or so times with coworkers and the service is always very friendly.   Oh, and you get to fill up on chips and homemade salsa while you wait for your food to come out. Om nom nom.

*Disclaimer* I had a pulled pork brisket sandwich from a catering truck at an event. Cost was $7 and included a side.   The smell from the truck was fantastic and I was starving, so I couldn't wait to dig in.   First bite, I got a mouthful of gristle. Ok, no problem, if at first you don't succeed...  Bite in again, another mouthful of gristle.  After I finished my last bite, I can conclude that their barbecue sauce and bread was very tasty. The little bit of meat I had in my sandwich wasn't bad, but I was so underwhelmed by all the gristle that it just wasn't enjoyable at all.   Hopefully this is the exception and they offer delicious briskest. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case for me or my wife.

David did an incredible job setting up my surround sound with no wires showing. He set up a guide for me to follow if I had any questions, and when I did call him with a question about my subwoofer not working, he walked me through how to get it up and running again.  I'd definitely recommend him to anyone looking to get a home theater system setup.

If you love your 7yr old listening to music that talks about being sexy and bars then this is the place!  If you love seeing 12 yr olds wearing belly shirts and short shorts flirting with the staff then this is the place!  If you love no AC at 114 temps and all they use are fans circling hot air then again you will love this place.  If you love hearing loud vacuums 30 min before closing-  I swear I see 6 staff members cleaning 30 min before closing .... ( Don't they know that we are breathing in the dust and dirt that they are sweeping up and being blown around by the industrial size fans????). I swear this is what you are looking for to have your daughters birthday!!!       (Not the birthday host-  just a parent)   EDIT- 10 min later they seriously just played Chumbawamba!   For some of you younger generations-  The song they played includes the repeated verse line "Pissing the night away"

Stufrageous earned all 5 stars and then some. Can't say how impressed I am with the staff and food.   First off, the staff - just incredibly nice and helpful. When I stopped by for the 1st time a week ago, the guy at the register made some solid recommendations (thank God no one was behind me in line lol) and even "hooked me up" with extra Mac N' Cheese Bites for the kiddos. When I went back for a second visit on Saturday he remembered me and asked how my wife liked the burger he suggested (spoiler alert - she loved it) and thanked me for coming back. Again, friendly and hospitable.   The food - the burger patty itself is pretty large and is pretty good, but obviously the inside is what makes it so good. If it's your first visit, you have to try the Mac N' Cheese stuffed burger. Sounds weird, but the creamy, cheesy goodness in every bite is ridiculously good. The bacon and blue cheese stuffed was pretty good, just not on the same level as the mac n' cheese. The Hawaiian is going to be my next burger of choice. Oh, and they do a really good lettuce wrap. It can get a little messy, but they are right up there with In-N-Out with quality lettuce wrap burgers.   Their outrageous sauce must be what Ed's secret sauce from Good Burger tasted like. Just ridiculously good. It has a nice little pop in it without being too spicy. I'm surprised they don't sell the sauce as a standalone product.   Their fries are different from most fast food fries and I love em. They're more like seasoned fries you'd get at a sit down restaurant.  Also, thought it was pretty cool they have the Barq's red cream soda as a soft drink choice. Don't always see that as an option.  Cleanliness - the place is well maintained and clean, which shouldn't be too surprising because they've been around for only a few months.   Word to the wise - it takes about 15 minutes for them to freshly prepare your grub, so if you'll be in a rush, call ahead and swing by to pick it up.
