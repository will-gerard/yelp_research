You really can't go wrong with any of the Italian dishes on the menu.  Eggplant and white clam linguine are delicious.

I had lunch with two girlfriends today before catching an afternoon movie.  I was completely taken aback by the prices and just couldn't get past this.  I mean seriously - $12 for a kale salad wrap?  Add chicken and you are at $16!!!???  For a wrap and a lttle side of fruit?  It tasted fine, though a little dry, but nothing close to special or memorable.  I can't justify it  and don't anticipate a return visit in my future.  Sorry, but there are other fresh and healthy options in the area with realistic pricing.

I stumbled upon this place today on Facebook and I'm SO glad I did.  I went with a co-worker to check it out today and loved it!  The owners were so welcoming and explained what was where and how it all worked.  We learned that it is best to get to the farm early on Thursday mornings for the best selection as they were out of most all of the goat milk products.  I bought a bit of produce and some Crows Dairy feta cheese as well as a couple of tomato plants and a chive and arugula plant.  It's great to have a hidden gem like this in the middle of Scottsdale.  Can't wait to go back!

Before I get to the reason for the 1 star review let me give you a little bit of background.  I "Yelped" banh mi sandwiches for Phoenix last night because I was craving one and wanted to find out what Yelpers out there think are the best.  I was a bit surprised to see Reathrey on the list as they are not a Vietnamese restaurant, but having patronized the restaurant at least a half dozen times, I decided to read through the reviews.    My boyfriend and I originally went to the restaurant after reading the glowing article in Phoenix Magazine.  Our first visit there was pretty uneventful.  We ordered the Mi Keaw soup, spring rolls and the crepe (which by the way was served slightly burned with that side facing down- but I never complain about my food and ordered it again on later visits).  My only real complaint that first evening was the incredibly uncomfortable bench seating.  On subsequent visits we opted for the tables in the center of the space.  I have tried a number of different things on the menu and while having no other Cambodian food to compare it to I find it to be just meahhh.  My boyfriend on the other hand loves the Mi Keaw soup and has ordered it as take out a number of times and is the reason for our repeat business.  In my opinion the Pho at many valley Vietnamese restaurants is much tastier.  Okay - back to the reason for the one star review.  So here I was reading through the reviews when I started coming across the owner's incredibly RUDE, SARCASTIC, CONDESCENDING, DISRESPECTFUL and downright UNACCEPTABLE responses to his less than stellar reviews.  I have three words for you GET OVER YOURSELF!!! I don't care if you are running a Michelan star rated restaurant (which CLEARLY you are not) that type of disgusting behavior will run your business into the ground.  I, for one, will be spreading the word and NOT in a good way.    Sincerely, A very disappointed EX-patron

I haven't had a thing on the menu that hasn't been seriously tasty.  Their take on Vietnamese pho is great, the salads are super fresh.  The fact that so many of the ingredients are seasonal and  locally sourced is a plus.  Keep doing what you are doing!

The decor and atmostphere was really great!  Kind of restored church meets industrial. couldn't stop looking around.  I had dinner with my son and we ordered a variety of things and everything was really tasty.  We started with the guac w/pineapple and serranos & queso duo.  I never would have thought to add grilled pineapple to guac but the sweetness played well with the spice of the serranos.  We had the Schreiner chorizo meatballs.  That came with slightly sweet and sour shredded beets and their prickly pear sauce.  They had me at Schreiner's.  We sampled two of the tacos - the taco of the day which was grilled chicken, corn and I don't remember what else as well as the chipotle cherry steak.  We enjoyed both and loved the (I believe house made) corn tortillas.  We also ordered the Adovada burrito.  Good stuff.  My son somehow still had room for dessert and ordered the tres leches cake.  It was fine but we both agreed we've had better.  Cocktails are handled well with a strong emphasis on craft tequilas.  No maragarita mix here.  2 thumbs up and we're looking forward to the next visit!

I've been three times and ordered the same thing each time - the French Quarter.  It's very tasty, healthy and a great "fast food" option.  The prices are a bit high but I will  spend the $10 for something quick, filling and healthy.  This is my new go-to spot on the days that I don't bring my lunch to work.

Wow!  I had dinner here earlier this week and was really, well....wowed!  We sat at the bar in front of the cooking action so we had a chance to get a little insight on the menu, ingredients, recommendations, etc.  We started out with the Peking duck bun.  Think Chinese taco.  It was seriously tasty, stuffed with succulent duck with a little bit of crisp on the edges and a tasty, bright dipping sauce.  Next we ordered the pig face  dumplings (cheek).  They were served on a little kimchi with their house made sriracha (they should bottle and sell the stuff).  The dumplings were tender and delicous.  The stand-out dish of the night for me was the wood grilled octopus.  I will return specifically for this dish.  As the name indicates, the pieces of octopus are wood grilled and have a slight char on them and are pile atop the crispy rice cake and surrounded by a beautiful, rich, bright and absolutely delicious broth.  This was hands down the best preparation of octopus I've ever had and it made me wonder why I'd never thought of grilling it.  It was super tender and the combo of flavors and textures - smokey, crispy, creamy, citrus, spice....superb.  Entrees did not disappoint.  We had the Kung Pao brisket with brown rice and the roasted pork ramen.  I can't say a bad thing about either dish.  From the super tender brisket in the Kung Pao and the perfectly cooked egg in the ramen, it was pure yumminess!  They somehow talked us into dessert and recommended the banana fritters served with a lush caramel sauce and their coconut rice pudding soft serve ice cream.  We practically licked the bowls clean.  Yeahhhhh...........we'll be back.  :-)

I have been here a handful of times and enjoyed breakfast, happy hour as well as dinner.  I've chosen to sit at the bar each visit and the service has been top notch each time.  Tanner was our server/bartender on my last visit and was super friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and helpful in choosing our entrees.  Among the things I've ordered the Thai Peanut Black Cod is my favorite so far.  Perfectly cooked, tender cod with a little heat served in a bright and delicious broth.  The wood grilled artichoke hearts are delicious.  My only critique would be the portion size is lacking for the price. The Flower Child Scramble and their delicious coffee is the perfect breakfast.  The restaurant is beautiful, business is hopping and the fact that they have ample parking is a plus.

I have been meaning to check this place out forever.  Welcome Diner is one of my fave spots so I had no doubt this would be great too.  I went specifically for the ramen that they make on the weekends.  It did not disappoint.  The home made pork bone broth is nothing short of amazing with a great depth of flavor/umami.  We also tried the chicken with the Vietnamese sauce.  I loved the sauce and can't believe how super crunchy and crispy they get the outside of the chicken while maintaining a perfectly juicy inside.  Will definitely go back and will try to get there a little earlier to take advantage of a larger selection of donuts.  The service was also great.  Super friendly.  Great job on all fronts.  :-)

Go!  Bring friends!  Order one of everything then go grab a drink at the bar to drink with it all.  Come back, sit at the counter and watch, what feels like your own private chef, create each beautiful artisan dish right in front of you. I have been a handful of times and went twice one weekend.  I love this place and the concept of the entire building.  Aaaaaamazing!!!!

I am a little bit obsessed with this place!  Super cool property, dj spinning music on the weekends at brunch, beautiful, fresh and fun eats.  I have been a handful of times for brunch and have tried quite a few things on the menu.  One of the servers suggested the brisket and polenta and it was fantastic.  Haven't had anything that I didn't enjoy.  Definitely a new favorite.  I am looking forward to date night and dinner soon.  :-)

This is a very much welcomed new neighborhood spot.  The decor is warm and rustic with barn wood on the walls and a distressed bar top.  They will be distilling spirits soon which will be unique to the neighborhood.  I have been in twice and have had the mahi tacos and shared the poutine fries and the buffalo chicken flatbread.  It would be hard to choose a favorite but I would probably say the tacos (so far).  The portion was very generous and the fish was fried perfectly.  I am looking forward to sampling more of the menu.  Service was friendly, attentive and helpful.  This place has a great vibe and appears to be off to a great start!!
