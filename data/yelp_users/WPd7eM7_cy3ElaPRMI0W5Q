This place is foul. My mother told me to avoid it years ago and I decided to try it thinking she may not have liked something I would... Yeah. The fish is no better quality than the frozen fish planks you can get from the grocery store. The fries had very little salt. The sauce is nothing more than cocktail sauce. How this place is popular is beyond me, I guess it's for the AZ natives.

I have been coming to il Vinaio for over a year now and I have never been made to feel like anything other than a friend here. The service is excellent and the staff are very knowledgeable. I recommend it to everyone I can as a place to celebrate or just to enjoy a delicious meal. I can't wait for the next donut and beer event.

I'm not much of one for a lot of their products but I must say that the books I have bought have been very well priced and in great condition. The artists that setup for events there are incredibly talented and personable people. Bob and his wife (sorry can't remember your name!) and their daughter Amanda are wonderful people and they need the support of the local community now as ever.
