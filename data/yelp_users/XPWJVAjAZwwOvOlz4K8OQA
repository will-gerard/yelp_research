I actually thought this buffet was the best one out of the three that we ate at (Rio's Carnival and Le Village Buffet included). We got here around 4:45 PM on a Saturday, which was super early as we had just eaten at Paris only five hours beforehand. But there was no wait at all, so we strolled through the line, got a table, and sat there for awhile before we got food. And pretty soon ten minutes later, there was a super long line! Talk about good timing. :)  The stations are pretty similar to the other buffets - Prime rib, salad, Asian, Italian, Seafood, Dessert, etc. They did have a Brazilian barbecue of lamb or beef off of skewers. That was pretty good. And yes, they had the crab legs. The only difference is that here, the crab legs are cut in half for you so you don't have to dig for the meat. So be prepared for the long lines. I stood behind a lady who took her time picking out all the crab legs ... and then she turned to me and said "my dinner..."   The clam chowder soup is good, and the prime rib is better than the other two buffets - very tender and delicious. Pretty worth it! I loaded my plate up with veggies - very fresh and the salad was crisp, too. The pizza, eh looked quite bad as if sitting there for a long time. They had some fried shrimp, I believe which was tasty.   The best part is the dessert! I think they also have a crepes station, but after the not so good crepes at Le Village, we decided to skip it. They have upside down cake with strawberries, chocolate cake, tarts, chocolate covered strawberries, creme brulee, cotton candy. I loaded up on the desserts and ended my meal with cotton candy - which was uberly sweet. And I also drank milk as my beverage. And feasted on some more creme brulee - which was not as good as Le Village! Not such a good combination with the prime rib, crab legs and whatnot and I ended up getting an upset stomach.   But! I really liked this buffet and the overall ambiance. The noise level is quite low and there are lots of booths/tables to divide up the room to give a more private sort of feeling. Don't forget to tip your server!

My family wanted to eat a good and cheap Christmas dinner as we were going to hit the buffets the next day. Known for the prime rib and steak and egg specials, Victorian Cafe was our destination that cold Christmas night. We got there around 9:30 PM and although there were a few empty tables, we were seated about ten minutes after we got there. Something about having to wait for the waitress to seat us.   Anyway, I scanned the Yelp reviews on what was good, and decided to go with their prime rib special, which is usually $12.99 but on that day, was raised to $13.99. Too bad the steak and egg special is valid only after 11 PM. Each prime rib special comes with a salad or soup and fries, mashed potatoes or a baked potato. And of course, the table gets a basket full of hot rolls and butter.   The salad and rolls were delicious, but we all wanted to save our appetites for the prime rib. (We all ordered the same thing, haha). The prime rib comes out a while later, which made us all think that ... man, they must have run out of prime rib, so they're cooking us some good fresh one! When it arrived, each one was pretty darn big. Mine was a little bigger than the size of my hand! Unfortunately, the prime rib tasted really weird. It didn't even taste like meat! I felt like I was chewing on some weird variation of prime rib (almost like a vegetarian prime rib). It tasted like an imitation, and not at all like how prime rib usually tastes. Needless to say, my family and I were all very disappointed. We had to force the prime rib down, and this was the first time we actually had food left on our plates that we did not take back in a to-go box.   Good service, good salad and bread, but sucky prime rib! The crust was too salty and the meat was too rubber tasting. We were confused as the meat was pink - not overcooked, but just not tasting the way it should. The ambiance was nice with dim lighting and booth seating (tables as well), but that prime rib was a shame.

There were SO many people the day that my sister and I went to the Shark Reef Aquarium in Mandalay Bay. I felt like the place let too many people in when the place is so incredibly small. At $18.00 for an adult ticket, this place is a rip-off. Compared to Long Beach Aquarium, there isn't much to see.   You are asked to take some pictures while there's a long line waiting and watching you pose like a shark is attacking you! Then you follow the trail and see a crocodile, fish, jelly-fish, turtles and more animals. And because this place is called "Shark Reef Aquarium" with signs of sharks all over the hotel, you would expect to see huge sharks swimming around. But the sharks are pretty tiny. The aquarium that I went to in Sydney had bigger sharks than this aquarium.   It took us about a half an hour to walk through the whole aquarium, only because there were so many people and we took a lot of pictures. The best thing about this aquarium is the open area where you can touch the sting rays. But still, I was faced with parents shoving their child in front of my face so that he could have a chance to touch the ray. "Do you mind if I let him touch the sting ray?" a parent asked me, before proceeding to shove me back and scoot his precious child to the edge to touch the sting ray without even waiting for my response. That was low.   Would not recommend for anybody who is looking for a cool place to visit that isn't too expensive. I think this shark reef is overpriced and not worth the money you pay. Go to the SIlverton Aquarium  instead. An impressive tank with lots of fish and live feedings for free!

I am so glad I ended my Vegas trip eating at Earl of Sandwich, and even more glad that they're opening up a second location in Anaheim. It was delicious and better than what I had expected. I already had seen the reviews, heard the raves about the warm sandwiches from my friend, but it was so delicious that it has to be about the best sandwich ever - and at an affordable price!  So Earl's is open 24 hours and is located in Planet Hollywood. I'm sure people flock here after the clubbing events and whatnot - that explains the 24 hours deal. We came here around 12 on a Saturday and there was a long line, but not too long a wait. You basically give your order to the cashier and she gives you a beeper and a receipt where you slide down the counter (watching them make the sandwiches and salads) before you pay at the second cashier. And a few minutes after that, your beeper rings signaling you to pick up your sandwich.   There were so many great options that I really wanted to try them all. In the end, I got The Earl's Club (Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Aged Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & Sandwich Sauce) and my friend got the Tuna and we traded half. The Club was really good - but what's so great about it is that the bread is warm and crispy, making the sandwich an overall plus. There wasn't too much bacon, but I liked the amount of turkey that was in it. The tuna was also great. The warm bread, a plus, and the tuna salad inside was awesome (better than Subway!). They cut the sandwich for you into a bigger half and a smaller half, but the overall sandwich is not that big. Perhaps about 6 inches. Each is wrapped up in a gold foil with a pretty sticker to differentiate between the various sandwiches.   There's a few tables to sit down and eat and relax. For the price of the sandwich (around six/seven dollars), I was pretty pleased. If only they came with some complimentary potato chips on the side :)   Can't wait to try the other sandwiches!

Thanks to Yelp, I was able to find this cute coffee shop in Scottsdale before heading back to CA. Echo Coffee is located in a small plaza with its own parking lot, so parking wasn't a hassle at all!   I personally loved the ambience of Echo Coffee. It's very similar to the more "hipster" coffee shops in LA. You can tell that they're serious about their coffee! Their decorations revolve around coffee, and they also have a ton of artwork featuring local artists that customers can buy if they find a piece that sits well with them.   I ended up only ordering a large iced latte, but it was worth the price! The latte was in a decent sized cup for the price I paid. (Large is $4.50 and regular is $4.) Coffee taste was strong and pretty smooth, although it was a tiny bit on the bitter side for me - which was perfect for my dad. I think it could have been a touch sweeter, but that's just me. Seeing all the pictures of the pretty latte art, I definitely wish I could have gotten the drink for in-store rather than to-go.   The pastries and baked goods looked fairly decent. There's lots of sofas for people to relax on as well as tables and chairs for studying. There was a good number of people that occupied the place on a weekday morning, so that's saying something!   tl;dr - good place for some authentic coffee!

A free aquarium in Las Vegas? Gotta go check it out. Haha, after going to the Shark Reef Aquarium at Mandalay Bay, my family decided to check out the Silverton Aquarium at the Silverton Casino. We asked one of the staff when it closes, and she said, "it's always open!" So apparently it isn't really an aquarium, per say. It's a big huge tank in the middle of the casino where anybody can enjoy the peace and solace that the view of the fish provide for you.   This aquarium is located between the Bass Pro Shop and the Mermaid Lounge, which are both in the back of the Silverton Casino. There are a few chairs in front of the 360 degree tank where you can sit down to enjoy the view. I believe there are even a few small sharks in the tank! As you walk around the tank, each particular panel always has different fish, and there is even a part of the aquarium where you can walk up to the fish and feel as if you're a part of them, too! Really really worth the experience, especially if you have kids and you want a nice and cheap (free!) place to visit. There are beautiful drawings of mermaids on the wall, and I believe they also have live feedings and mermaids that will come and swim around once or twice a day.   This aquarium, along with the waterfall from the Bass Pro Shop really give Vegas a different perspective, if that makes sense. Be sure to check it out!

Seriously. Top-notch quality macarons for $1.10 each? Patisserie Manon's macarons were definitely worth my visit here! While there are lots of other pastries, baked goods, and delectable looking cakes in the front of the store, my eyes were set on the colorful macarons behind the glass display that greets you the moment you walk into the store. These macarons are a little differently shaped than the ones I am used to (more flat and cookie like) - these are strange puffed up shells making them longer and less wide than I am  used to. The color of the shells also look a little artificial because they are so bright. BUT, they were amazing.   I bought eight macarons, trying to test all the different flavors. Overall, I felt that the macarons had a really puffy texture upon first bite, but then became chewy afterwards, making the perfect combination of shell and filling to give you that great macaron enjoyment.   My favorite flavors were:  Rose - not too heavy. It contained the perfect flowery taste to delight my tastebuds. And the shells were pink and white!   Salted Caramel - I loved the flavor of the caramel! Not too sticky, but had a good consistency that worked really well with the shells.  I also really liked lemon and strawberry. They didn't taste extraordinary, but they had very good taste. The strawberry even had bits of real strawberry inside of the filling.   Flavors that were a-ok:  Ginger - Interesting flavor, but not my cup of tea. I love ginger candy, but I thought the taste was a little weird for a macaron. It was also really sticky.   Mango - It was interesting, but a bit too artificial for my liking.   Pistachio - I thought the pistachio had good almond flavor in the shell, and the filling was also decent. I'm not a big fan of pistachio macarons, but these were okay.   Mocha - It wasn't too strong on the mocha taste, but I liked it. Not memorable, but something I would try again!  When I was buying the macarons, they informed me that they had salted caramel and mango in the back. I don't know if they would have told me this if I hadn't asked them about the flavors, but as I am a big salted caramel macaron fan, I would definitely have been bummed out if I missed out on this flavor!   If I lived in Vegas, I would definitely be coming by a few times a month to pick up macarons! And their cakes! They were gorgeous and very elaborate (but expensive!)!   Patisserie Manon is located in a quiet plaza next to the Whole Foods market plaza. We weren't sure at first where it was, but we saw a man standing outside with a sign. I also saw another location for this place down the street. I guess they have two storefronts? They have lots of seating inside the restaurant, and I believe a café where you can order drinks and sandwiches further inside the store.   I definitely will be coming back when I'm in Vegas!

The best idea I made while in Arizona was making a stop at the Local Donut before heading back to California. Apparently this donut shop had just opened in the Scottsdale area, and the many great reviews boasting about their fabulous gourmet donuts was enough to convince me to stop by myself.   The Local Donut is located in a commercial lot on Hayden Road. When I had gone a few weeks ago, they were in the process of putting up a sign. With the sign, I bet this storefront will be much more eye-catching. I came in the middle of a weekday and was pretty surprised to find the place empty, but the racks FULL of amazing donuts. I know donuts run out fairly quickly, so I embraced my luck and began searching for the right ones to fit my mood.   The BEST thing about this place is that they sell gourmet donuts at an extremely affordable cost. Gourmet donuts in LA can cost anywhere from $3-4 even $5, but all donuts were under $2. In my excitement, I completely forgot to take a picture of the menu, but I believe all traditional donuts were $1 or under, filled donuts were maybe $1.50 and fancy donuts were $1.75 or $1.95. I could be wrong, but I just remember seeing the prices and thinking, "wow, what a steal! I want to buy them all!" They also offer donut deals where you can mix any dozen traditional, fancy, or custom (mixture of both) at a set price. Really great deal if you're buying for a party or for the office.   I ended up going with the crème brulee and maple bacon donut, just because they were highly recommended by the worker.   Crème brulee donut: I didn't eat this fresh and ate it a few hours later once I got back to LA. It was surprisingly still very good, although it probably would have tasted better if I had eaten it right then and there. The caramelized sugar on top and the crème filling went nicely together, and wasn't too sweet. The donut itself was super soft. I think I would have preferred the cream inside to be a bit sweeter, but overall this was still amazing. Probably better than the one I had at The Donuttery. And the presentation of the donut itself was so pretty!   Maple Bacon: The worker mentioned that this was probably the most popular donut they have. I do like maple donuts and even though I'm not the biggest fan of sweet and savory mixed together, I definitely wanted to try a crowd favorite. This was amazing! So glad I was able to try this donut. I've actually tried the maple bacon one from Sidecar and Voodoo, and I have to say that this one surpasses ALL Maple Bacon donuts I've ever tried. The maple coating on the donut was sweet enough that even without the bacon, it would have been really good. But the bacon pieces were lightly crisp to perfection. I think the bacon in Arizona is on another level than the ones I've eaten in LA. That mixture of savory and sweet and crisp and soft - my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Highly recommend!  Traditional glazed donut: I asked my dad if he wanted any donut in particular, and he basically said nope, he likes the traditional regular safe donuts. The donut was good and I liked the softness of the donut upon biting into it, but it was nowhere near as good as my specialty donuts. Even my dad admitted that, after trying my maple bacon, his paled in comparison.   Storefront is really cute and modern, with a few tables and chairs inside and outside. The workers are really friendly and nice, but everything kinda fades away once you step inside the store and see piles and piles of gorgeous donuts in front of you. And I wasn't even a big fan of donuts until I met Danny N.! (Thanks, btw)  tl;dr - Overall, I highly recommend making a stop at The Local Donut if you're in the area or traveling to Arizona. If you like sweets/donuts/desserts, you'll definitely love the donuts they serve here! Prices are SUPER affordable and the presentation of the donuts are amazing! If they had a storefront in LA, I would be a regular customer for sure!
