This review is for the Maternity/Labor and Delivery/Post Partum Care. We would not come back here or encourage people to come here. There are hospitals that provide better service in our opinion.   Pros 1 Nice Labor and Delivery Room.  2. Nice Attentive nurses in Labor and Delivery 3. Registration/Checking in is simple 4. Parking is convenient  Cons (1) Post-Partum Rooms are old, small and run down. The bed was not comfortable.   (2) During my stay, the post partum nurses were friendly but spent must time chatting/gossiping instead of being attentive to patients IMHO.   (3) Resident Physicians were not a positive experience. We didn't feel comfortable in their care. Would have preferred not to have dealt with residents.  A Resident also delayed our discharge by hours by not dropping off a written prescription  (4) Billing Office was difficult. They tried to make us pay for our newborn's charges which were different from the mother's charges. Newborn babies are not yet on insurance plans. And since they are not yet on your insurance, the charges are very high as you could imagine. We were not required to pay them before leaving the hospital but they certainly pressured us into paying. We went home and put our baby on our insurance plan which reduced the charges by 2/3.   (5) Discharge was significantly delayed.  An ultrasound and hearing screen was ordered the previous day in the morning. They didn't do the ultrasound and hearing screen until the following day in the afternoon. These are routine tests that are usually done a few hours after they are ordered. Instead of going home that morning, we didn't leave until 4 PM. What contributed to the delay was a Resident failing to leave a prescription that our doctor ordered.

Disappointing!   1. Reheated rice: rice was brought to us immediately and it didn't even encompass 1/2 of the container. It looked as it was brought from another table and microwaved  2. The Hot Braised Shrimp had dry little baby shrimps with virtually no sauce.   3. The Kung Pao chicken had a slight odor to it. I thought the flavor was okay but it was nothing special.  4. I questioned if the food overall was reheated because we were served instantly as in less than 10 minutes. It just tasted re-heated and not as if it was freshly prepared  5. We dined at 7 PM and the restaurant was empty.  6. The restaurant itself was fairly nice but nothing that stood out.  7. The service was good and we were attended to immediately  8. The General Tsao (I know it's not real Chinese but what the hell right) it was deep fried but tasted as if it was fried in old oil and the chicken was chewy  9.  The menu was unimpressive. It was the most generic Chinese menu I've seen. It is very Americanized  10. No, I would not go here again unless it was for a business lunch. This is definitely not a dinner place. This restaurant could be good but there was a large amount of apathy. It just seemed they like they didn't try. It was fairly obvious they reheated a lot of their dishes and the restaurant was empty. Schechwan Palace in the same complex is far better and I would recommend that.  This place claims to be an authentic Shanghai restaurant but it was so Americanized. They need a new chef, new owner because this restaurant has potential

I won't repeat what has already been said but there has been some myths that need clarifying  1. Both the Chinese and Americanized menus are written in English including the description of the dishes. Also, you can ask the waiter to explain the specials. You don't have to speak Chinese or be Chinese to know the specials. After dining here, I realize some people want to sound unique or VIP but trust me, you don't have to be Chinese to taste all the dishes. That is B.S.  2. The Yelp photos donated by members make the dishes appear larger than they are. Most of the sauteed dishes like the Kung Pao chicken and Egglant were not big but then some like the Water Boil chicken was rather big.  3. The food is spicy but it isn't hot. If I had to compare it to a Thai restaurant, the food is about a 5 on a 10 scale. You will probably need to ask them to make it spicier even if you are not one of those crazy people that have to eat everything hot.   4. They do NOT use reheated rice. I was expecting reheated rice that you typically find at Wongs and other Chinese restaurants. This place had fresh soft and sticky rice. It was great.  5. Don't take the American menu for granted. It's done pretty well and includes mainstream meats like chicken, beef, pork. The Chinese menu has tripe and meats not typically eaten by Americans which is why it's left off the American menu. You will likely use the American menu as your base and then use the Chinese menu to add select items. Bottomline: get both menus  6. The restaurant is not a hole in the wall. It's the opposite. It's the nicest Chinese restaurant I've been to in the valley. Yes it is small but stylish and well lit  7. The restaurant is definitely busy but not stand in line busy. We were immediately seated and we went on a Friday night at peak hour.   8. The service was suprisingly good. Like most great and authentic Chinese restaurants, the service is lousy with the waiters being expressionless and forcing you to order quickly. The servers were Chinese but were very friendly and acted like family. They didn't rush you. Water was refilled quickly  9. Dishes - read what has already been written. This is covered well. I insist on order the the Water Boil dish (includes choice of chicken, beef, fish or shrimp) and ordering it spicy!  10. You don't have to be with a big group, a grad student at ASU or someone who speaks Chinese to enjoy this restaurant. The idea intimidates people because they make it sound as if it's so authentic since it's included in the Chinese Cultural Center but don't be.  My wife and I are not Chinese and it was just the two of us. And we had a great time

I would like to respond to Jetta's description below. I like AABC for all the reasons he doesn't like them.  Yes, they may only sell comics and toys but they do that better than anyone else. It's about quality not quantity.  He asked how they stay in business when there are so many comic stores in the valley.  The truth is the other stores are garbage. Read on  (1)  They don't pilfer through the comics before putting them on the shelves. The owner even unloads the comics from the boxes right in front of you and lays them out on a glass table. So if you are guy who is trying to acquire that CGI 10.0, you will have a chance at this store. At Atomic Comics and the other stores, they go through the comics before the store opens and selectively remove the comics in the very best condition for their employees.  (2) They leave the comics on the shelves longer. They are not greedy. They don't pull a comic off a shelf and mark it up a $1-$2 a week to two weeks later. They only do this if a comic is ridiculously hot which is rare. It's nice to know that you can find a comic a month after it arrived on the market selling at cover price. There is not another comic store in Phoenix that does this. Take my word for it. I've been to everyone and they pull them off the shelves quickly  (3) They don't stuff their shelves and the comics are in great condition. I have been to every comics store in the valley and AABC is the only store in which the comics are consistently in great conditions on the shelves. You will not see bent corners. You won't see shelves being overly stuffed so that the first few issues and the last few issues in a stack are damaged.   (4) Inventory- If its not at AABC, I go to the internet because it's not going to be at any other store in the valley.  I have too many stories of walking into other comic stores and requesting an issue and they are out or don't have it only to find 2 or 3 copies at AABC.  (5) Sales: there is not another store in the valley that gives you 25% of everything in the store on Jan 1st and July 4th every year.  That includes the high priced collectors items like Incredible Hulk 181. They also have a graphic novel punch card much like a Subways sandwhich card.   (6) Service: It has a mom and pop feel so you get to know the actual owners of the store. The employees actually work and are helpful if you ask questions. They are not just standing around chatting with each other like you find at Atomic Comics.  They are also humble and are not condescending. This is a great place for collectors and readers of all experience. They are also not pushy. They don't push any comics on people. I love how you can stare at comics for 45 min  in peace without someone hassling you or making you feel guilty.  They will help if you need it but they will leave you alone.   (7) Ambience: I feel like I'm walking into a Comic store not a Nine Inch Nails museum.  It's colorful, clean, organized and easy to navigate. it doesn't look like some cheap strip mall store like Heroes or god forbid Stalking Moon in which it seems like some Geek bough a collection on Ebay and decided to pay rent next to some Chinese buffet and open a comics store.  (8) JUST COMICS: This is exactly why I come here.  I was at Atomic Comics in Chandler and I couldn't even check out some comics because the shelf was being blocked by a card table.  (9) Clientele:  Look, I'm not a typical comic collectors. I don't wear tight black shirts,  I have no facial hair or piercings, I'm not up to date on all the independent "alternative" comics, I love Marvel and DC. I can't stand "Goth." Yeah,  I'm a regular guy who also happens to like comics. If you are one of these people, you will feel comfortable here.  If you haven't read comics in ages and just wanna check out the scene,  this is your place    (10) KNOWLEDGE: The employees are educated about comics but are not pretentious. Phil is a comics' genius but he isn't intimidating. Eddie is very up-to-date on all the latest indie stuff but he will tell you honestly what he thinks about an issue and if a series is worth collecting. No pushy sales people  To show that I'm not the owner and to be fair, I do think their prices can be steep and I don't always think their older items are accurately described. I also think they can charge too much for variant issues when they first arrive. Their toy prices are pretty fair and you can get steals in this

I'm a comics purist. I want to be able to walk into a store and find my comic in pristine condition on the shelf. I want someone to roam the aisles or stack shelves and if I have questions, I want them to enthusiastic and help me. If I spend a lot of money at the counter, i want to be treated like a regular or someone worthy of respect.  Instead, this is my typical experience. I walk in and I see all of  stores employees standing behind the counter and laughing and talking obnoxiously loud with one another.  I don't see anyone looking at comics. The most activity in the store is at the card table. I usually don't find my comic on the shelf because they failed to order enough comics as usual.  I walk up to the counter and wait 3 minutes until the employees finish their conversation with each other.  I ask them about the comic and this is their response: "Uh..which comic is that, Yeah, sorry I have no idea when they came out. I don't read Marvel or D.C. sorry.  Yeah I don't know if we will get that in. You might want to try one of our other stores dude. Oh hey, we have this sale on Crapola #1"  After responding no, I'm not interested "You sure dude, it's a great book and that's a really great price"  This is usually what I endure when I walk into Atomic Comics. I went to All About Books and Comics and the employees actually knew which comics arrived this week on the top of their head. They   knew which ones sold out and that was rare because the issue I wanted was usually on the shelf in multitudes. They were in great condition.  They were pretty normal everyday people who read comics as a hobby as opposed to being these weird emos who were more into manga.

Word of Warning: There are several Thai Basils all over the valley and I've heard the other branches are not good.  I was told to dine at this particular branch in Ahwautukee (Chandler Blvd and 44th).  This Thai food is better than Thai Rama (both branches), Sawadee, Mailees and Pink ?.   The reason this restaurant is good is because the curries are made well. Curry should not have the consistency of soup (Thai Rama). It should be thick enough to mix with rice.  The flavors in the curry were spot on. Their Massaman curry and Peanut curry was cooked perfectly and flavored well.  Furthermore, the curries were spicy but not so hot that you couldn't taste the flavors. The other dishes are great too particularly the sauteed or mixed vegetables.   The disappointing dishes include the rish dishes. The fried rice had huge chunks of uncut cauliflower and cabbage everywhere...so much so that you couldn't really enjoy it.  Both Thai Rama and Touch of Thai in Glendale have much better fried rice.  The Negative; The restaurant is extemely tiny and claustrophobic. It is clean and modern so don't think run down Asian restaurant. The service was a little mediocre. The waiters are two young men who go to ASU or just party. They are fast but don't ask questions and not really there to serve you. They want to get you in and out.  So while they won't ignore you, they aren't going to really ask you if you need anything else.  I was disappointed because they forgot to bring one of our dishes. It was almost 25 minutes late when compared to our other dishes that were already served. Instead of admitting the mistake, the waiter tried to argue that the dish was being prepared when it was obvious he was lying and just tried to get them to prepare something ASAP so he wouldn't have to eat the cost of the dish.  That was rather annoying.  Bottomline: Great Food but order it to go. You will actually get more food and avoid the mediocre service and small dining space

I've been here multiple times the service continues to get worse. They are severely understaffed and it's impacting everything from their service to their food. We waited an additional 40 minutes for carryout when we were told the food would be ready in 20 minutes. They shorted us on rice as well. We ordered multiple dishes and they gave us one box of rice instead of a box with each dish like they are supposed to provide. The quality of the food is slipping. The curries continue to become more watery. The sauteed dishes or so dilute with water that you can't taste any seasoning but rather just limp vegetables that resemble a bad broth. It is sad because this place used to be 5 stars but it seems to me that they really don't care about customer service. Today was so pathetic, they had one person(one of the owners) serving tables, taking phone orders and busing tables. And the restaurant was busy! Seriously, you can't afford to hire a couple of waiters?   This place used to be 5 stars back when they had a normal waitstaff but for the past 3 years or so, it just seems like they don't care about customer service. Unfortunately, now it's impacting their food.   I would only order carryout. Stick to the curries. If they tell you 20 minutes, double or triple that time when arriving to pick it up. And don't tip on carryout!!!

This is not a "cute" and eclectic grocery store the trendy crowd will venture to. It's a very unassuming nuts and bolts Middle Eastern grocery store. This is certainly not a date place. This place is simply for those who want the best falafel in the city. I've been searching all over the valley for an authentic falafel with the green batter. There were two people who ran the store and they barely spoke a word. Despite being quiet, they were polite and friendly. There was plenty of room to sit with many tables. I would not recommend this place for those who are not familiar with Middle Eastern cuisine as this is not really a "date" place. However, if you are someone like me and are sick of the faux Middle Eastern/Greek clones and desire the real thing that you would find in a place like Michigan or New York, go here!

Pros 1. Nice glass selection - unlike Visionworks - they cary high fashion frames like Prada, Burberry, Versace, Polo, Gucci and Ray Ban 2. Very organized in their process. They provide you with a lens case, where you select 4-5 frames. You try them on and they take a picture of you with all of them on.  3. Fast- Their glasses are done in about an hour like they advertise  Cons 1. Very salesy and they push for features that drive up the cost of the glasses. 2. Insurance plan only covers the cheap lenses. The lenses that you want are very expensive and usually over a $100 by themselves not including the frames 3. They push for a $35 service fee that is unnecessary in my opinion. It's similar to car rental companies charging for insurance when you already have coverage thru your insurance 4. Understaffed - we had to wait a long time before someone helped us. 5. They will push for you to buy a second pair of glasses for 40% off to suggest you are getting a deal when in reality the glasses are so marked up that 40% off $300 glasses isn't really a deal.  Bottomline- can be okay but just be prepared for the upselling. You don't need antireflective coating and other special lenses that your insurance plan doesn't cover. You don't need the repair plan.  You don't need a second pair of glasses. Be prepared to walk away.

In Phoenix, there are essentially 3 types of Indian restaurants. None of the restaurants in the valley can compare to good ones in real cities but there are some good ones: Royal Taj, Guru Palace, Dehli Palace. Then there are tolerable ones: India Palace, Tandoori Times, Indian Paradise and then there is everything else (places you shouldn't go to).  India Gate is one of these places.  I'm Indian and we tend to be picky about which Indian restaurants we eat at. Just like you wont find a Sicilian at the Olive Garden, yoy won't find a Desi at India Gate unless they work at Intel and are too lazy to drive to a decent restaurant.

The service here is markedly better than Apple stores in the rest of the Valley. We were recently at the Scottsdale Apple Store at Scottsdale Quarter. Our purpose was to purchase a Macbook Air. We walked in and were thoroughly ignored despite the store being not busy. The clerks were busy chatting with each other instead of walking around asking if customers want help. We've experienced poor service there before. Therefore, we decided to take our business elsewhere and went to the Chandler store. We were immediately greeted. The person spent a lot of time with us and answered all of our questions. He went out of his way to help us. He didn't seem like he was in a rush to leave. We made the right decision not to purchase at the Scottsdale Quarter Apple store and come here. We've bought all of our Apple products at this store and now we know why.  Mind you, the service is not perfect here. However, it's as perfect as you are going to get for an Apple store in the Valley. I've been to them all and this is by far the best one. The reason for that is the Chandler location itself. People are educated and sophistated but laid back and approachable at the same time. You don't get that vibe at any other Apple Store in the Valley. That Chandler vibe is felt here. The genius bar can get busy but the techs do their best to provide good servce. They actually apologize for being late unlike the other Apple stores. Look it's an Apple Store, the genius bar is going to get busy. If you don't want to wait then avoid busy periods like the Friday, Saturday and Sunday night. Go in the mornings if possible. Just use common sense.

As others have said, it's a chain however not all chains are alike. This particular Rubios is really clean, has great service and the clientele is classy. It's not loud and full of teenagers or gang bangers. The tables are clean. There are a lot of families that come here. The person taking your order will often bring the food to you. You can tell this particular location is a favorite among the locals, particularly those with kids. I've been here on multiple occasions and I've been pleased every time. Sure, it's not as Yelp trendy to write about a chain but for those who have matured past trying to appear cool on Yelp and just want nice food with nice service, come here.

I took my family here and this was a disappointin experience. The service was snobby and rude.  The waitress was condescending and the food was overprices. I have not been to the other Tomasos but I will clearly discourage anyone from dining at the Chandler Tomasos. The service is clearly substandard and snobby.

I was very disappointed today. I walked in inquiring about the Obama Spiderman issue. I was told they sold out.  I wanted to know how many copies they had because other stores of similar size  in the valley usually get similar volume. Instead of giving me a straight answer, they tried to pawn off the second printing. I told them I was only interested in the first printing because I'm a colletor.    Apparently they thought I was some moron off the street that didn't have any money so they tried to convince me to buy the second printing and convince me that it was going to be a collectors item. They were trying to get me to preorder it.  Anyway, I hate these shady sales tactics. I usually shop at All About Books and Comics but Atomic is closer to my house so sometimes I will pop in there. Now I know why I avoid this place.  They have nice t-shirts but otherwise, I avoid this place. Furthermore, their comics are not always kept in the best condition and many of their issues are wrinkled. They also filter their comics before placing them on the wrack to covet the ones in the best condition.

I've frequented Teakwoods for the past 10 years. And this place has changed for the worse. It used to be a trendy ski-lodge Wisconsin-Colorado bar with cute and friendly waitresses. The crowd used to be a young educated crowd who would come here for drinks before venturing out to Scottsdale or Tempe.    Now, it almost feels like a glorified Applebees.  The crowd has gotten older. You see a lot of good ole boys and meatheads eat here. The waitresses transformed from being fun and cute girls that you would see in a trendy Tempe bar to homely girls who don't smile and seem to hate their life.  Whatever was fun and charming about this place has been lost.  Don't worry, Teakwoods will always be busy because the Applebees crowd is going to continue to flock to this place because the food and prices are excellent. However, the service and vibe has taken a major hit. I would recommend Zipps or Payton's place before Teakwoods.  In terms of watching sports, this isn't a great place. Not all of the TV's are flat screens and nearly all the TV's in that side room have old school TV's with bad reception.  They also don't have common sense in regards to programming. For example, they had the nerve to have soccer playing on several of the TV's during March Madness.

We went here for a New Years eve party. We assumed it was going to be more relaxed and mature since it was located north and away from its Old Town counterpart The place was entirely full of guys. Our group consisted of couples and it was irritating as several drunk guys kept trying to approach our significant others. I can't say I blame those guys and I felt bad for them as well since they paid a lot of money to attend this party and meet women and there were none. It eventually turned into another Scotsdale club scene. It was not classy. The dance floor was claustrophobic.

I'm Indian and have eaten at several of the Indian restaurants in the valley. Yes, I recognize that Indian restaurants in Phoenix generally suck.  So with that in mind, Royal Taj is the second best Indian restaurant in the valley (Guru Palace is #1). In another city with quality Indian restaurants, this restaurant would get 3.5 to 4 starts but for Phoenix, it's the best.  It's a true Indian Punjabi restaurant that makes great Malai Kofta, Chicken Tikka Masala, Palak Paneer, Boti Kebob and Tandoori chicken.  They serve their tandoori dishes on sizzling clay plates which even nice restaurants like Dehli Palace (Tempe: University and Rural) doesn't do.  That being said, the restaurant isn't without it's flaws. It's located in an abandoned strip mall that can feel unsafe at times with strange people walking around.  In addition, the restaurant had a bad odor the other night.  The service needs improvement.  There is essentially one server for the entire restaurant (the wife of the cook). She is very sweet but doesn't speak English well but she understands English perfectly.  The lamb is a little dry.  I would stick to their curries.   With all of this being said, it is the second best Indian restaurant in the valley.  A lot of the so-called Indian restaurants like Tandoori Times are really Pakastani restaurants which is a different style of cuisine that specializes in more grilled items but uses less spices and sauces. It's also not a South Indian restaurant posing as a north Indian restaurant.

Arguably the best or second best Indian restaurant in the valley. I had the food there the other day and it's still up there. I'm Indian and very picky about Indian food. I don't eat at buffets because I feel the quality of food isn't that good, that's how picky I am. And this place and Guru Palace are the only Indian restaurants in the Phoenix Metropolitan area that deserve 5 stars.

I'm giving first place back to Royal Taj. After less than stellar experiences at Guru Palace (60 and Gilbert) and Taj Mahal (McDowell and Scottsdale), Royal Taj is getting back my vote for the best Indian Restaurant in the valley. In case you haven't followed my reviews, I'm an Indian food connoisseur and have been to nearly Indian restaurant in the Valley. In my opinion, Royal Taj, Guru Palace and Taj Mahal are in the top 3 Indian restaurants in the valley. I'm not one of these clueless guys who judges a restaurant by how many selections were offered at the buffet. It's about quality not quantity and I don't eat at buffets because you are getting the watered down spiceless stuff they serve to the mainstream.    The food was truly outstanding and I think word is finally getting around because the place was packed. The Chicken Tikka Masala got the perfect blend of creaminess and smoothness to the curry that Guru Palace and Taja Mahal lacked. The palak paneer is the best in the city and it's truly unique in that they don't mix cheap pieces of broccoli and pure into a soup. It's the real deal..real spinach with no filler. The naan was excellent as always. Everything is pretty good on this menu.   Again, the only knock on this place is its ambience. It's a hole in the wall but then against so are most Chinese and Mexican places (the good ones anyway) so if you are truly about great Indian food come here.

The food had no flavor.  It's a very generic Americanized version of Italian food.  It tastes very similar to the Macaroni Grill.  The bread had to be soaked in olive oil to taste good otherwise it tasted a little stale.  The tomato sauce tastes similar to a bottled sauce you can get at any grocery store. There was nothing authentic or homemade tasting about the sauce. The portions were generous and the prices were nice.This is a not an authentic NY style or Sicialian style restaurant with flavor. When we dined there at 6 PM on a weekday, the restaurant was empty. There were two old Italian people at a cash register at the front who didn't even make eye contact and were busy crunching numbers.  This restaurant has no passion or anything unique about it.   You can tell this restaurant is for the Olive Garden crowd who feels they are branching out and getting a unique Italian experience by eating here.  This restaurant reminded me of Italian restaurants in the southern United States or "Eye-talian" restaurants as I call them.  Think bland, lots of cheese, big portions, cheap prices, stereotypical dishes aka Carrabas

I agree with Margaret's view below. There is a lot of attitude at this place. Until recently, they used to charge you for refills on drinks.  There is a lot of attitude here from the waitstaff.  They hire a bunch of kids who don't know there menu and really don't care about their food....or you for that matter.    The pizza has no taste. The cheese clumps instead of melts. The toppings like the pepperoni tastes as if came of a DiGiorno frozen pizza and their other Italian dishes taste as if someone bought some Hunts Ketchup and poured it over pasta.   Oh yeah and did I mention the attitude?  The only reason this place is still in business is because its become a happy hour hangout among the students in the area and the blue collar workers who to get their fill of their dollar Budweisers.  I feel bad for anyone who actually takes this place seriously and drives here to have dinner.   Their wings are good and their happy hour is amazing otherwise, I'm giving this place one star

Although it has a generic name, don't let that fool you. "Greek Wraps" has the best fallafel in the city. It's not dry or overcooked. It's seasoned perfectly. The shwarma is also the best in the city. The kebab is tough and overcooked. Their humus is good but not very authentic tasting. This is better than Spices in Chandler and Phoenicia in Gilbert. Their gyros are good but many places make great gyros. Go here for the falafel and ask for the chile sauce

I used this company based on Yelp reviews and they are the real deal. Read my reviews, I'm not someone who gives 5 stars to everyone. If I'm giving them 5 stars, pay attention. I've used them twice and they've done an amazing job. If you own luxury cars, you need to use them. I only use OEM glass (the original glass that comes with your car when you first buy it) and they have it in stock AND they magically get my insurance to cover it. When I tried other glass dealers in the area( yeah the ones you are comparing them to on Yelp), they would somehow tell me that my insurance didn't cover the OEM glass or that they didn't make that glass any longer or some other b.s. Basically, the other glass dealers didn't want to put the expensive glass on my vehicle and wanted to use their cheap glass they had in stock and lied to me about my insurance coverage. You will see a lot of that from glass guys so beware.   The best part of this company is the person who you speak when you first call. The girls do a great job communicating with your insurance company and they make the transition so much easier. When I called, the lady who answered was very friendly. I gave her my VIN number and my insurance agent's number. She said she would call them and take care of everything. She did and then called me an hour later and did a 3 way with my insurance. They offer that extra piece of service.  The techs came to my work and replaced the glass and did a great job.

The novelty of the place does impact it but it shouldn't be discounted. Phoenix doesn't have a lot of unique mom and pop restaurants so when you find one like Lo-Lo's that offers soul food in the valley, you should definitely check it out.   The food itself was excellent. I've been to Gus' fried chicken in Memphis and the chicken here is just as good. The side dishes is what prevented this place from hitting 5 stars. While they were good, they were nothing special. I will come back here again.  One more thing, this place is safe. We went here on a Saturday night assuming the place would be full of questionable characters because the restaurant's location isn't in the best part of the city (Buckeye and Central) and at night on a Saturday, we were a little worried about safety. However, everything was fine. The diners were all classy with a great mixed crowd of African Americans and Whites and even the staff is mixed. It was rather "preppy" believe it or not. We will definitely come back.

I used this company through my home warranty. They were polite, on-time and efficient. They were also easy to schedule fairly quickly. They are also in the East Valley now too.   The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because the scheduling lady is kind of rude and has a bad attitude on the phone.  She can be difficult to work with but the people who actually come and provide the work do a great job and are really friendly.  If I had to use them outside of my home warranty, I would probably get multiple quotes. I saw how much they charged my warranty company and their quotes seemed expensive. But with regard to service, they were outstanding.

I used them through my home warranty in April. They fixed a problem with the motor and it reoccurred. The problem persisted and when they came out again, they tried to say the door was the issue and needed to be replaced. It was obvious to me, that they just wanted to sell a new door. It was also frustrating that the tech arrived not knowing what they did during the previous visit. He didn't call their office nor did he care to. I did his job for him and called the office. When I called, they gave me a hard time about this and were not friendly about disclosing what they did. They gave me attitude and tried to say that it was my fault because I didn't replace the door already. Funny because the tech agreed with me and fixed the problem with the motor; it had nothing to do with the door.   That being said, they do some nice things. They do arrive on time. They do call in advance to give you an accurate idea of when the tech will be by. They also try to fit you in for service the same day. The techs who arrive have all been friendly and approachable. I wouldn't use them outside of my home warranty. I am very suspicious of their prices.  I would definitely comparison shop and get a second opinion before buying or agreeing to any plan they put forth.

The food is so good that you overlook the obvious flaws. It's not located in the best part of town particularly at night. It's in a divey strip mall. The service is what you would expect from a mom and pop Asian restaurant so I'll let you figure that one out.   But this is the best Pho in the city. They really get it right and if you are looking for amazing food, you'll come here. This is one place where the food carries it.

I'm genuinely suprised this store is even in business. I agree with Cassi's review. The Atomic Comics in Chandler is full of pushy salespeople whereas this one has employees who ignore you completely.  If you need help getting a comic off the wall or looking up something for you, they give you attitude and take a really long time.    The inventory is quite poor and any comic that is remotely in demand will not be found here; you will need to visit their Chandler store to have a chance.  Their comics are also in poor condition. They don't take care of their comics. The ones on the wall are listed at NM are really in VF at the very best.  Lastly the store is tiny and claustrophobic. Most of the customers in their don't seem to be collectors but bored teenagers who went skating or some guy who brings in 3 of his kids just to roam and hog the ailes.

Extremely overrated! I read all these reviews hoping to experience a slice of heaven and I can already tell you that Jimmy and Joe's, and Rays pizza is by far better.  The crust had no flavor and it was a little too thick for thin crust. The crust had too much yeast and you got full after too slices because of all the air in the crust thanks to the yeast overdose.  The crust was also very dry and a bit hard. The toppings were good particularly the sausage.    The cheese gave it away as a phony.  The way you distinguish between a real NY style pizza and a fake one (like this one) is through the cheese. Real places make their own mozzarella or acquire the real thing.  Real mozzarrella should have an almost a rubbery consistency with a very salty aftertaste. If it tastes smooth and melts too evenly, it's not the real thing. I'm not saying it should clump but it should taste natural and this mozzarrela was not legit. In fact, it had no flavor The sauce lacked any zip to it. It was very plain and non acidic.   The bottomline is this place is hype. It has a great sounding name. The menu offers plenty of options to make this place sound good and it's pictures and website are nice but the pizza is average. I would not come back here

I called another 5 star Electrician on Yelp with lots of reviews and they didn't have the courtesy or professionalism to call me back. I assumed this place would treat me the same way since they have nearly the same number of reviews and were probably really busy.   They actually picked up the phone and were friendly. They were busy but I told them about my predicament and how I need service soon. They accommodated my request. When I waited for a quote, I was shocked by the actual quote. It was about $300 less than another reputable Yelp reviewed electrician. It was comical because I kept asking Jordan to repeat the quote and I think he assumed I thought his quote was too high. Nope, it was the same reasonable quote. I hired them on the spot and they did a great job.   They have my loyalty and I will not hire another electrician in the Valley.

Not a bad substitute for All About Books and Comics. Probably the second best comics shop in Phoenix-Valley.  It has sort of the same vibe to it as AABC but with a trendier younger crowd as its next to ASU. Non-crampy and good layout.  Comics are in good condition and there are plenty of back issues.  The sales staff were helpful but not pushy. At the same time, they were not really friendly and you had no interest getting to know these people on a personal level.  I definitely recommend them over Atomic Comics for their service and over Samurai for their space. Still, it's no match for AABC.  Although close, their volumeof back issues is still lacking compared to AABC and in regards to new issues, you better get there that first week because they don't order enough new issues.

This is a Pakastani restaurant.  It only includes the word Indian to be more p.c.  I'm Indian so I grew up on Indian food and that's what I enjoy.  I have some Pakastani friends who enjoy this restaurant.  This food is more meat laden and not spicy which is typical of Pakastani food. This is not an Indian restaurant by any means.  If you are Pakastani, I think you wil enjoy this restaurant more than the Indian restaurants in the valley. If you are a non-Indian/Pakastani, you may prefer this restaurant because it's not very spicy and it has a lot of meat dishes in the buffet etc.

I've been to this one and the one in Mesa on Alma School. The food is excellent. In terms of food only, I think it's arguably the best in the valley.  It's spicy, flavorful and well prepared.  Anything on the menu is delicious.   Regarding the "spice" factor. If you are not used to eating ethnic food or spicy food, the salsa will be really hot for you so avoid it. If you are used ot eating Indian, Thai, Chinese etc. then you will actually like the sauce and question why all the other salsas in the valley are bad.    That being said, the Service is horrible and it's been horrible for the last 10 years or so.  They charge for refills on chips. They give you very little chips in a small tin bowl.  They don't refill your drinks. They take forever before you order.  They are inflexible in altering items to cater to vegetarians (Im not vegetarian but I've been there with vegetarians). The waiters have attitude.   If the service was somewhat respectable, I would eat there more often. Still the food is delcisious but go there with the expectation that you will pay a lot of moneyand endure horrible service.  This is one of the few places in Phoenix that I will endure bad service because the food is so good.

I thought they closed the Mesa restaurant (I was there over a year ago). Anyway, "I've been to this one and the one on Central in Phoenix. The food is excellent. In terms of food only, I think it's arguably the best in the valley.  It's spicy, flavorful and well prepared.  Anything on the menu is delicious.    About the Mesa vs. Phoenix thing...to be honest, I think the Mesa one tastes better. The Mesa one definitely tastes more authentic and has more flavor. The Phoenix one tastes more Americanized as if it is geared toward Gringos.  That being said, the Service is horrible and it's been horrible for the last 10 years or so. No, I'm not being hard on them.  They charge for refills on chips!!!! They give you very little chips in a small tin bowl.  They don't refill your drinks. They take forever before you order.  They are inflexible in altering items to cater to vegetarians (Im not vegetarian but I've been there with vegetarians). The waiters have attitude and leave before you can ask questions.   If the service was somewhat respectable, I would eat there more often. Still the food is delicous but go there with the expectation that you will pay a lot of money and endure horrible service.  It's almost a joke because the service is so consistently bad the owner doesn't really care because people still eat there. NOTE TO THE OWNER: Yes, people eat there with bad service but if you provided better service, guys like me would eat there 20 times a year instead of twice a year!    P.S.  The best Margaritas in the WORLD...I've been everywhere and you won't get  abetter margarita. It's not Kool Aid nor is it tequila with lime....strong but actually tasty. Don't order a pitcher though. It's a rip-off. They water it down to save money

The Bamboo Club has an interesting history. It was at one point, THE restaurant to dine in the Phoenix metro. The first was orginally located in the Biltmore and I have fond memories of dining there. Unfortunately, it expanded too fast and there were multiple locations that were forced to shut down including its vaunted Biltmore location, the Mill avenue restaurant and the Desert Ridge location. I would describe it's cooking style as a fusion between Americanized "PF Changs" style food and authentic Hong Kong style Chinese fare. This fusion is wonderfully balanced and it still makes the best orange chicken I've ever tasted.   The environment is purely Scottsdale. It's very trendy with contemporary finishing and mood lighting. Unfortunately, you also have the 30K millionaire waiters with their black t-shirts, model-wannabe good looks and arrogance serving you. I remember one waitress told me that my choice wasn't "the most daring decision" regarding my ordering the orange chicken. It was so funny because she had no idea how many time I had been into the restaurant and she was talking down to me as if I was some teenager. Nonetheless, the hit or miss service and the price is what has always kept the Bamboo Club from truly reaching that next level.   That being said, don't let the critics disuade you from trying this amazing restaurant. Yes, it isn't like eating in Chinatown in SF but only a moron would compare the Bamboo club to a restaurant like that since it's approach is completely different. I've been to Honk Kong and have dined at the finest restaurants in NY and SF and trust me, the Bamboo is definitely worth checking out.

I was literally at Devils Martini the day it opened.  This place started out as a lounge for people their mid 20's to early 30's with an LA (think Sky Bar) feel. They had no dance floor. It was a lounge designed for classy people based on a Toronto concept.  It was wonderful. They had great drinks and food. The staff was friendly, classy and intelligent. Then they sold out and turned the place into a club in 2004/2005, it changed it's approach and tried to compete with Axis Radius, and Mist as a club. They opened that huge room and turned it into a dance floor. The service also became snobby and they hired some yutz who worked at Gucci to be the door man and act prestigous.  As the years have progressed, the crowd continues to get younger.  Now it's almost exclusively ASU students who are under 25 coming there to get trashed and dance. Someone accidentally spilled part of a drink on my wife and never apologized or said anything in that typical ASU sloppy stoned college mentality.  Not suprisingly, the guy wanted to fight me (yawn)...  After that moment, I realized what this place had become: CLUB RIO except dress it up and make the ASU students wear long sleeve shirts and leave their baseball hats at home.   If you are like me and want a place in which you know the guys are not going to hold drinks above their heads and stick their other hand in the air, go to Suede, Six, PCL and Dirty Pretty.  Unfortunately, the ASU crowd has taken over this place and what class this place once had is completely gone. It's basically a Tempe club transplanted to Old Town.

If Cibo was located in a large urban city like NY or SF, it would be lucky to get 2 stars. However, in Phoenix, this place gets a 3.5 stars for it's ambience. The restaurant is a very nice cozy mix of a pizzeria, a ski lodge and a patio bar.  It has a very unique and fun feel. It's also located in downtown Phoenix.  It has a very Northern California house type of feel. The wine selection was excellent and it was served chilled. The service was excellent and they were very laid back.    However, the pizza was disappointing.  The crust was soggy and it could have been much crispier. It definitely did not taste baked and there was no substance to it. It felt you were just picking up slabs of cheese with sauce. The cheese was good but not great. It almost passed the authenitc test but it's still lacked the texture and flavor of authentic mozzarella. Normally, I wouldn't criticize cheese so intensely but this place is trying to compete with the likes of authentic "Italy" Italian pizza with the likes of pizzeria bianco yet it failed to measure up. Nonetheless, Pizzeria Bianco is incredibly hyped in my opinion too.  Still, I would recommend this place because it is fun and unique. And people should check it out. It's not a cookie cutter chain that Phoenix is known to have. Furthermore, you will get the same experience as Pizzeria Bianco without the hype and the 3 hour wait.

This was the best club in the Valley for years and really started the upscale clubbing scene in the valley that made clubs in NY and LA envious. I remember coming here in 1999 and there were Lamborghini Diablos, Bentleys and Rolls Royces parked in front. People actually dressed well and the women were gorgeous. It was really a scene out of a movie.  My have things changed! It went from being a glamorous upscale club to a trashy skate boarder/ska/hip hop club. It's made for the ESPN X-games crowd as opposed to the martini/lounge/W crowd that it once held. I certainly don't like rich snobs but there is some merit to an upscale club and this place lost that sense of class it once had. It has a lot of potential and it could easily be the best place in Scottsdale if it reinvented itself.

Clearly worth 4 stars! One of the best sushi restaurants in the valley! It's better than Ra but not better than Sushi Roku. The service was also excellent. The waitresses are beautiful but friendly and didn't give off that trite Scottsdale "I'm too good to work here" vibe.   The prices were not cheap. If anyone pretends this is affordable sushi, they are lying or stupid. We had a party of 4 and spent $130 including drinks. We only ordered maki rolls too. That same meal at Ra would have been less than a $100. It's not the most expensive sushi restaurant in the valley but it's not "affordable or inexpensive"  The only real knock on the place was it's claustrophobic atmosphere. This place is terrible for big groups. It's an ideal couples restaurant. We had 4 people and felt like our group was too big. There isn't much seating but they did their best to accomodate us. The restaurant is really narrow.   I would recommend this restaurant but only for couples and for those willing to spend over $80 if you are going to eat and drink alcohol.

No, it's not just a swanky metrosexual bar. I walked into Ticoz with the same perception as everyone else; 'This place is popular because it looks like a cool place to be seen"  And like many places in Phoenix/Scottsdale, the trendy swank restaurants are more hype than substance. I walked in here thinking this is another place that could serve dog shit but if they dress it up with a nice drinks, good looking people and a Crate and Barrel catalog, it will get 5 stars.  So my wife and I chose to eat here in the afternoon when it wasn't busy. We actually ordered food in addition to drinks. I was shocked. The food was actually delicious....not, not good....delicious. The food has a lot of flavor and is well prepared without it being heavy.  At the same time, the food is still well grounded in Mexican ingredients so you are not eating fru frue eclectic dishes that are designed to be different just for the sake of being so.  Therefore, you won't see Octopus tacos with cinammon salsa...no nothing like that.  I had a wondefully slow cooked  pork that was served in a spicy sauce over cheese enchilada.   They have a fresh citrus Paella that is fragrant and flavorful without being too greasy. The margaritas were disappointing. They were strong with no flavor.  It was like drinking lemon flavored tequila.  HOWEVER, the mojitos were out of this world.  Finally, to the reviewer below who had an issue with the gay staff....what were you thinking when you entered the place...that they had a waiter sitting on the bench that they recruited from Black Angus just for people like you?  Would the food and drinks taste better if a dude "with testicles" served you?

There is no true Chaat(snacks) house in Phoenix but this is the closest thing. There are a lot of other establishments that are trying to take a cut out of this latest Indian Chaat craze like Tandoor Times and Woodlands but this is as real as it gets until someone moves here and opens a legitimate Chaat house.  All of the food is vegetarian. This is the Indian version of tapas with fried vegetarian food. Yes, it's delcisous.  Yes, you wil want to take a nap when you leave. Their samosa chaat, kachori and chole batura are excellent.  The paratha can vary. Sometimes it's perfect and other times it's greasy.  Honestly, I have no complaints about the food. The prices are extremely reasonable. You can eat a full meal for $10.  The downside is obvious....it's in a Grocery Store.  There are tables in this family owned Indian grocery store.  They decided to serve chaat one day and put out some plastic tables That's what this is.  Hopefully, they can make enough money to open a full fledged, full time chaat store.

I used to frequent this place but have not gone in over a year. I went here the other day and the place was dead. It looks like it is going to go out of business. It was i2 in the afternoon and there wasn't one person behind the counter working and no one was eating inside. I could have robbed the place and no one would have known. I walked in and two guys lazily came out but no one greeted me. The grille wasn't even turned on. I'm sorry but I had no patience to wait 30 minutes for them to make me a fallafel and french fries because the fryers and grill was turned off due to a lack of customers. I just walked out of there and no one proceeded to stop me or ask me if they could help me. The menu was also different and worse. The previous menu had combo platters and prices, this one just had pictures of food with no prices attached or lists.  I can tell this particular branch is going out of business. They had no customers.  It's sad because two years ago, this place was packed and thriving.

In a nutshell, this is why I would NOT recommend coming to this theater.  1. Poor Air Conditioning- The theaters have been hot during most of the movies I've seen here. Asking management to turn down the A/C did little to resolve the issue. It seems like this is an ongoing problem.   2. Long Lines - We waited 15 minutes to pick up our tickets we already purchased online. There was no separate line for online buyers to rush through just to print their tickets. If they did create one, they do a poor job of identifying it and there was no person to direct us to it.  3. Kicking People Out of Seats - I have to routinely kick people out of our reserved seats because guests were not properly informed about the reserved seating system in my opinion.  4. Delayed Screening Times - I'm not referring to the movie. I'm referring to the previews not starting on time. During one occasion, we had to tell management to turn the projectors on because it was 30 minutes past the movie time and the previews didn't even start. Yes, that actually happened.

In my opinion, they did not have good customer service. We arrived and no one immediately checked us in. There were 3 people working there and no one was waiting. By checking in, I am referring to them registering us, taking our name etc. The lady in charge  asked if we were a walk in or an appointment. Once we told them we were a walk-in, she didn't say anything else to us. One employee said she would check us in but then ignored us for another 10 minutes.  They didn't tell us how long the next appointment would be.    I think one of their clients may have had lice. They were selling a lice shampoo and instructing the parent how to apply it and pointed to the boy's scalp. After we got up left. No one followed us or attempted to ask why we were leaving. I know lice is common among children but it can be highly contagious. This was my perception of the situation and I cannot say for a fact the child had lice. And although I have no information regarding their sanitary/hygiene procedures, I personally did not feel comfortable having my child's hair cut there afterward.  We chose to leave. Finally, their prices were expensive  in my opinion. For their "supreme haircut" it was 18.95 not including tax or trip. I took my child to a salon and paid $30. For 12 dollars more, my child received great customer service and had their hair cut by a stylist with shampoo and rinse.

This a wonderful place to learn music. They are very patient and compassionate with children. Ive observed some of the lessons and they're great with kids particularly young kids. They didn't have rigid requirements about age so if you want to start tour child early, this is the place to go.  My child is excited to come here for classes. Their pricing is more than reasonable.

I was not impressed with their service. The desiger or representative who provided the estimate was late, condescending and dare I say lazy. He wanted to do the least possible with regard to his design yet provided a very expensive estimate. Based on that experience, we chose not to go with them and went with another firm and they provided much better service and professionalism.

I'm suprised there aren't higher scores because I'm usually the one who rips places. In a nutshell, this is a better version of your standard Phoenix Americanized Mexican restaurant (Macayos, Los Olivos, Ajo Als, Abuelos, Chevys etc). It's Americanized Mexican food but the reason it's better is all the little things are executed well. The chips were not stale and chewy but fresh out of the fryer and crispy and hot. The beans were hot and had melted cheese nestled in it instead of your typical dry refried bean paste (Macayos). The queso dip was not microwaved Velveeta that got cool after 3 minutes, it was stringy and melted and pieces of onion and pepper in it that had almost a fondue texture. The plate was piping hot to the point that the sauce in the plate was boiling. I hate when Mexican food is served cool (Macayos) and you can see that the cheese is still partly in shredded cheese form (Arriba). The service was also friendly and timely. We were not abandoned, our drinks were refilled.  So what's lacking...flavor. Although the food was hot, the cheese was melted and everything was executed well, there was nothing about the food that made you crave it like Los Dos Molinos. The Margarita was not served in a margarita  glass which I thought was a little weird and it was a little too tart. The hours of operation are weird. The place closes at 9 PM even on weekends!  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's a better executed version of a lot of the Americanized Mexican restaurants in the valley.

They have a nice selection of groceries. I like that they carry name brand products like Laxami and Patak's. Some of the Indian grocery in Phoenix try to market their own brands instead of carrying mainstream and recognized brands. The store was clean, spacious and well lit.  I have not noticed any expired food or expired dates. However, let's be honest this is a problem of all Indian grocery stores. They all try to sell expired products and you have to be careful and look at the labels and not buy strange or old looking cans or bottles of pickle  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the service. They are not rude but they are not friendly or helpful either. The owner was reading a newspaper and didn't want to be disturbed with questions and doesn't smile or try to be helpful.  We were afraid to ask questions.   The prices were fair and inexpensive. We spent $35 total and bought a small bag of rice, bag of po ha grain, large bag sabudhana, three bottles of achar, and several of bags of spices. This would have been $50 at Lee Lee's market or another grocery store in the valley.  I would recommend coming here but just be aware not to ask too many questions to the owner. If you live in Chandler, this is the only grocery store in the area. If there was another one with friendlier service, we would shop there. Hopefully someone reads this and opens another store.

The level of service here is amazing. My child has asthma. We saw Dr. Rahul Rishi and he was great. Dr. Rishi took his time and went out of his way to manage my daughter's asthma. My primary doctor only gave me a rescue inhaler and her asthma was not controlled. Dr. Rishi prescribed me a nebulizer and a controller inhaler. He even gave me some free samples so I didn't have to go to the pharmacy right away. He and his nurse Jan really took their time and showed us how to use the inhalers properly which our primary never did. They completed school forms and Dr. Rishi made sure that my daughter was allowed to carry her rescue inhaler on her. He spent an extra 30 minutes with us to make sure everything was done before we left.  I have never experienced this from another doctor. We are very happy to have Dr. Rishi as our doctor.

The reviews are pretty accurate in my opinion. We have received poor service from them. Their service is inconsistent. At times they are great and at other times, they were there for 5 minutes and left. They promise to provide all of these service with each cleaning and in our experience, they have not done so. I can't recall the last time I saw them brush the sides of our pool. They don't always empty every basket. And I've never seen them vacuum the pool floor. And we paid for their highest level of service. We've called to complain about their techs being not thorough and they were rather defensive and didn't apologize or see what they could do to improve service. Overall, this is the attitude they seem to embrace. Rather than put the customer first, they get defensive. There have been other problems. For example, they stopped providing service on two separate occasions. In my opinion, their front office is disorganized. On two different occasions, they stopped providing service due to problems with their front office. On one occassion, they lost our billing information and another, they forgot to put us on their schedule.

I really want to like Aaron Pools. I've been with them for a long time but enough is enough. The quality of their cleaning and maintenance is shoddy and lazy in my opinion. I watched their techs stay for no more than 5 minutes. The bottom of my pool floor had visible dirt and the water was cloudy. There has been a lot of turnover in terms of their pool boys. With rare exception, most have been less than stellar. Their front office can be difficult to deal with. I can echo the experiences others have had with the manager and owner.  I cannot recommend them.

My wife and i were at Zipps watching a game and decided to have lunch at this little joint.  We were not expecting much because the place looked like a teeny bopper joint. There were high school kids all over the place with skate boards. The girl working the register was 16 and slow and didn't really know how to take an order. Even the kid making the pizzas behind the counter seemed like he was 17.  They were all wearing these black t-shirts with their logo on it as if it were a high school senior year shirt.. Yeah, the place looked like a Jamba Juice populated with kids  However, we were hungry and it was too late to ask for our money back now.  We also spent 10 bucks for two salads, two slices and two drinks.  That's obviously not expensive but it's not exactly a deal either.   We were shocked. The pizza was a 5/5.  It was better than Rays. It was better than Gus. It was better Venezia.  The crust was crispy but not burnt. The sauce was tangy but not overpowering. The mozzarella tasted like real mozzarella in that it was slightly rubbery and had that great salt water aftertaste. In other words, it tasted like a genuine NY pie. I know the New Yorkers are not going to give it's full due out of pride but if you put this place in NY and removed the Jamba Juiece ambience, any New Yorker would be fooled. Anyway, that 1 slice was practically the size of an entire pizza.  The flavor was spot on.  We go to NYC a lot so we know what real "pie" tastes like and this place passed the litmus test. If you have read my other reviews, you know I'm rather picky in regards to critiquing places and this pizza passed my standards. It's also much better tasting than high profile places like Gus' pizza in Tempe. In fact, there is no comparison, this place is significantly better..  The reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because it's tiny and doesn't really have any place to eat. Rays and Gus' feel like a large 10,000 sq foot Chinese buffet by comparison.  Also, the teenager Jamba Juice atmosphere is a little annoying

This is the best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. I've been to them all: Los Dos Molinos, Bario Cafe, Old Tortilla Factory....this beats them all. This place is definitely more authentic tasting than the ones listed above as well although it's still not the real deal but to be honest, real Mexico Mexican food is not that good anyway (Menudo anyone).    Don't be afraid of it's outdoor appearance. It looks like a Liquor store from the outside until you realize it's a restaurant. Inside the restaurant is clean and beautiful. The service is friendly and the food is delicious. Their salsa is not watery nor is it mild and lacking in flavor like all the other restaurants in Phoenix except for Los Dos.  The only problem is its location.  It's at the northeast corner of 7th ave and Buckeye (I-10 and 7th ave) During daylight hours it's safe.  And it's pretty safe on the weekends if you can arrive there before 7 PM but on Friday and Saturday, I wouldn't eat there past 7:30.  There are a lot of police officers who eat there and it's local cop joint so its not that dangerous. YOu will have some homeless dudes ask you for money on your way in or out.

The service was lousy. Our waitress didn't bring out our drinks for 20 minutes and we had to flag her down just to get those drinks. We were essentially ignored the entire night as she  never checked up on us, or refilled our drinks and the restaurant was not busy so there was no excuse for her lousy service. We had to flag her down again just to get our bill. The restaurant wasn't busy which was strange because this was right before an event. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't good. It had no flavor. If you are seeking simple bar food, I would recommend Jacksons on Third and Cooperstown over this place. I would even recommend the Matador restaurant next door. We won't be coming back and I don't recommend this place

The sad thing about reviews of Phoenix Indian restaurants are made by non-Indians and others who have no real experience with Indian food. The reviews of Curry Leaf are an example of that.  This is not a restaurant by any means.  This is fast food Indian.  The food was bland and tasteless.  I'm Indian so I know what I'm talking about.  I ordered a Chicken Tikka Masala "wrap"  The chicken was dry and had little sauce. It was also expensive.  It was made by some Auntie who has no experience cooking; she is not a professional cook.    I hate to write this review because the people were nice and it's in a nice convenient location but I was very disappointed.  It really looked as if a couple quit their jobs and decided to open an eatery.  It was very cheap looking and they charged a lot of money for very subpar food. I know we need more Indian restaurants/eateries in the Phoenix area but at the same time we should have standards. This place would clearly not be in business in a city with several quality Indian restaurants like Dallas, Houston, NY, Chicago, LA and SF have.

I'm suprised this place is still in business. This place used to be "India Palace."  The owners relocated to a brand new establishment at 35th and Bell which has a much nicer ambience.  The owners then decided to make this old location "Zest of India" which was supposed to be their cute way of offering a variety of styles (north and south) indian food. Instead, this place has become a joke. It's a mediocre cheap Indian restaurant.  I'm honestly suprised this place is still in business. Hey, when the non-Indians are ripping on this place, you know it's bad.

Let me preface this by saying I'm Indian and regularly dine at Indian restaurants in the valley so if you are someone like me who is interested in reading something other than "Their buffet was a great deal... " , then read on.  Wait, while I'm at it, people, please don't view Indian restaurants like Chinese buffets. It's not about how much you can pile on your plate. In fact, Indian Restaurants put out their worst food at buffets because they know the mainstream only care about piling on bad food as long as its cheap. For the rest of us who care about quality, this review is for you.   I think you will be impressed with this restaurant. If you are Indian and you have lived in Phoenix, you know the Phoenix metro lacks quality Indian restaurants and you settle on the ones they have. That being said, this is truly a normal Indian restaurant that you are used to from back home (NY, Chicago, LA, SF, Boston, Dallas, Houston etc.)  First, the restaurant was clean and open. It had vaulted ceilings and plenty of space so it wasn't claustrophobic inside.  The ambience was nice yet not stuffy.  It was trendy enough but not overly cliche with cheesy gold and brass everywhere.  The service was great and timely.  The waiters were Indians who were American raised so they could speak English. Most of the Indian restaurants in the valley hire Hispanics or Indians who don't speak English well so that was a plus. It's location is a plus. Although technically the restaurant is in Mesa, think Gilbert because the restaurant is basically at the intersection at Gilbert and Baseline right at the border of Gilbert and Mesa so it's in a nice area that is safe.   The Food: This is a true Punjabi owned and operated restaurant so their north Indian dishes are the real thing. Their chicken tikka masala had a nice smooth and consistent texture that was not grainy or overly creamy. The meat was succulent and not overcooked.  The naan was great and it's hard to criticize it but honestly, I've had better naan at other restaurants. Their naan was a little doughy but at least it was large and not some cheap small portion (India Palace).  The palak paneer is honestly the best in the city.  It wasn't soupy/liquidy in consistency like most of the restaurants.  It had flavor and was cooked perfectly.  Palak Paneer is a tough dish to make and most of the Phoenix restaurants mess it up by making this cream of spinach soup rather than a proper sabji.  Their malai kofta was their only real flaw of the evening as the kofta balls were not properly fried nor did they maintain their shape.  It was more or less just a curry. It was improperly cooked.   This is the best Indian restaurant in the valley.  Royal Taj in Tempe is a close second but this is the best

It's slipped a notch! A little disappointed this time. The Tandoori chicken was disappointing but better than most places in Phoenix. They served it sizzling but there were only 4 pieces of chicken which is small. Most Tandoori chicken serves 6-8 pieces and the pieces are generally bigger; I've eaten at many Indian restaurants all over the country and that is fairly standard for a good Indian restaurant but for whatever reason, NONE of the Indian restaurants in Phoenix can manage to produce the type of quality Tandoori chicken that you get in NY, Boston, Dallas, Houston etc. The chicken wasn't marinated either so the meat wasn't as flavorful. The Tandoori chicken at Taj Mahal is better and more flavorful. The service was also a little lackluster. It depends on who you get as your server. The female servers are really nice but one of the gentleman who waits tables is not that friendly and he essentially forgot about us.  Furthermore, the Chicken Vindaloo claims it has pieces of white mean on the menu but it was all dark meat chicken which is a little careless and cheap on behalf the restaurant. I've also been served the wrong curry in the past and had to argue my case (it was obvious, you can't mistake chicken tikka masala for another curry)  At this point, I would have to say Taj Mahal is the best Indian restaurant in the city. Their service is better and the so is their food but Guru palace is still excellent and the second or third best restaurant but was disappointed.

I saw the Heart Attack Grill on television and knew they had scantily clad nurses and lard induced food. What you don't realize is the restaurant is really going for more than the lard version of Hooters.  They want to give you the feeling that you are eating in a strip club.  By that, I'm not suggesting that the nurses are inappropriate or wearing too little clothing. It's just that you walk in and they have long tables shaped like a bar with stools. It's like a cheap inside joke, they are TRYING to be the ultimate guys hangout: lard burgers and fries, waitresses who are dressed like stripper nurses, no veggies, no diet coke,  all the lard drenched steak fries you can eat, corona's and regular coke served in bottles.    Yeah, I'm fine with all of that and I understand this place is going for that theme.   So in short, the concept is fun but the execution is horrible. Here are the problems  1. Food: the burgers tasted as if they went to Food City and bought the cheapest meat they could buy and dump it in some lard. The lard didn't not make the food taste any different with the exception that I felt really full and heavy at the end of my meal. The food was very disappointing.   2. Scantilly clad women in nurses outfits are fine as long as the women wearing the outfits are attractive. That wasn't the case here. They are not even Hooters quality in terms of attractiveness.  3. Yes, I want greasy food but I don't want to feel like I'm standing next to the fryer as I eat the food. The floor had so much grease that had condensed from the air that I almost slipped several times. The place had a bad odor and it just stank from the lard. You felt like you were eating in the kitchen.  4. Lack of service: the nurses chat with you and are friendly but they don't serve you. It's like Fudruckers. You get your own fries. You put toppings on your own burger. You fill out your own order/check at the end. The waitress only takes your drink order and points to a wall and aks you to pick out a burger  5. Scary crowd: the people eating at the restaurant reminded me of people on the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. We are talking major rednecks here!  It was mostly middle aged guys sitting by themselves and eating as if they were at a strip club I also saw a bunch of kids eat here and they looked as if they running moonshine between Kentucky and Ohio in the 1920's.  6. No credit cards.  They have an ATM in the place if you lack cash  7. Expensive.  I paid 14 dollars for a beer and a burger.  For the cheap a$#$ environment, you woud think the prices would be less but you

3.5 stars- Recommend  Quick Facts: This is not a formal sit down restaurant. You order at the cash register and they bring it to your table. They do serve you on plates and clean up after you so it's not quite Chipotle or Baja Fresh in that manner.   Pros: I agree with others. In light of the lack of locally owned restaurants and Middle Eastern ones at that, Spices is a refreshing change. The service is friendly and quick. Prices are fair ($8-10 a meal) and the food is good overall. Their strengths are their kebab, humus and shwarma. I would recommend ordering their plates instead of their individual sandwhiches  Cons: While Spices is good, it's not great. I would only recommend this place for those who live in Chandler and the South Tempe area. There are better options in other parts of the valley. Their falafel is overcooked and dry. Their gyro meat was tasteless and even had an odor to it. Even their shwarma was shredded and not in nice cube like chunks of grilled meat. I still thought all of those dishes were pretty good in the same way that I feel Baja Fresh is good with regard to burritos. It's tasty, fast, and economical but noteworthy or craveworthy.   Here are my recommendations to the owners if they are reading  1. Don't overcook your fallatel balls. They are dry and needs salt and some red pepper  2. Shwarma - offer some grilled shwarma cubes of white breast meat in the same style that you cook your kebab  3. You need to buy new pita bread. It is extremely tough and tasteless  4. Gyro - offer larger slices of gyro meat instead of the shoe lace shreds that are offered

Update: the service has really fallen over the years.  In our opinion, the owner routinely makes inappropriate comments that border on rudeness. On one occasion, we arrived at 7 PM and the owner essentially warned us that he would kick us out at 8 PM sharp implying that we were going to stay there for an hour as if we don't have anything better to do than hang out in his restaurant for an hour.  When you compliment the restaurant or food, he is never grateful and is rather self-congratulatory, making comments like "Yeah we are the best"  Previous reviews regarding table arrangements reflects our experience. They will often have "reserved" signs on certain tables during times when the restaurant is empty. The tables are not reserved but they don't want smaller parties occupying their larger table even if you may need the additional space.  They also nickel and diming has also gotten out of hand. They charged us for water in a to go a cup after we had already paid them and tipped them $5 (yes on a takeout order).  We are loyal customers but we just have not been shown the same level of respect and professionalism that you would think we would be given.   Regarding the food, many of the criticisms ring true for us. The pita is often served cold and is chewy. They stopped serving a spicy hummus which was delicious. The kebab used to come out sizzling and tender. Now, it's often served room temperature and lacks flavor. I agree the falafel is over-fried and comes out almost burned at times. This restaurant is just nothing remotely what it was when it first opened. It is a tragedy because we used to really enjoy this place. Fortunately, a plethora of great Middle Eastern restaurants opened since Spices first opened 6 years ago.

NOTE: Ignore the reviews above. It looks as if there is some deliberate attempt by the Udupai owners to pose as members and bash this place. Yes, this owner used to own Udupai Cafe and Udupai Cafe is another dosa house that competes with this eatery.  If you read my other reviews, you know that I'm critical and  my attention to detail is there so I'm not one of these people who likes every place he eats at.  Positives I'm Indian and I can assure you this place is good. I have never been to Udupai Cafe but based on its failing health inspections, I would be scared to eat there. Woodlands is a nice CLEAN eatery in a nice part of Chandler.  It's not a restaurant.  It's basically a Dosa shop. They  specialize in Dosa and offer several types. They also have excellent Indian Chinese dishes.   The food is consistently good and I have eaten there on several occassions.  This is a lunch/light dinner place.  Don't think of this place like a restaurant.  There are several types of Dosa and that's what this place specializes in.  The restaurant is also modern and not is some ghetto strip mall so don't worry about failing health codes here...at least not for a while.  Negatives Their non-South Indian dishes are not so good. For non-Indians, they should be informed that this is a Dosa house so order dosa and other south Indian dishes.  Don't order your typical Indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer (it wasn't good here).   The owner also says every dish is excellent which isn't true; he is kind of a businessman so he doesn't really care about telling you which dishes stand out.  Stick to the Dosa and the Vegetable Manchurian.  Their mango shake wasn't very good. Their chiku shake is great.

Okay, so I know you are wondering: "What's with the 5 stars" ..fine..that skepticism is warranted so the answer is a very simple: grade inflation...as in grade inflation for Phoenix Indian restaurants. We all know the Indian restaurants are terrible in Phoenix in general so the ones that are pretty good deserve higher than normal grades.   Don't get me wrong, my expectations were exceeded when I dined at "The" Dhaba.  Guru palace is still better and in regards to food, I would say Royal Taj is slightly better but The Dhaba is a strong 3rd place.  And in terms of the overall total package, I would rank The Dhaba the 2nd best Indian restaurant in the city.   The ambience reminds me of the contemporary small joints you see in NYC or SF.  The restaurant is narrow yet not claustrophobic. The style is contemporary with nice mood lighting to give it a comfortable 'lounge" like feel to it.  They have the standard flat screen television with Bollywood playing. There are two servers.  There is a non-Indian server and an Indian server.  Luckily we got the Indian server because the other one just seemed a little strange like the reviewer below said.  I thought the service was pretty good. No, our waiter didn't exchange pleasantries or talk to us but he was efficient. Water was continuously replenished in our cups which was a nice change for an Indian restaurant.   A big hit with me were the plates and cutlery.  They were all metal including the cups which provides an additional authentic feel of dining in India. The water especially tastes cooler when it's served in a metal cup.  And just to avoid confusing people, there are two parts to Dhaba. They have a fast-food like chaat place which is next door to its restaurant component. We dined at the restaurant.   The food: The food was well prepared. The texture especially was captured right. The chicken tikka masala was creamy and not runny. The quality of the chicken included thick chunks of white chicken breast. The saag paneer had a nice smooth pureed consistency but it wasn't runny.  My favorite aspect was the naan which had amlost a paratha texture to it with flaky layers yet it was baked and crunchy on the outside but wasn't burned. The rice wasn't dry or overcooked like you receive at most Indian restaurants.  In terms of heat, it was perfect. It wasn't too hot or mild. I though they really nailed it there. So what was missing? Flavor.. the food didn't lack flavor but it did lack that addictive quality that makes you want to come back by yourself and just chow down when you just got finished working out for 2 hours. Oh, don't get me wrong, food was tasty and far better than 90% of the Indian restaurants in the valley including some vaunted favorites like Dehli Palace in Tempe, India Palace on 35th and Bell, Tandoori Times and Maharaj Palace to name a few.  The malai kofta was arguably the best in the city  The only weak dish was the saag paneer; yes they got the texture right but it was a bit plain and it could have used more spice.    Something that deserves mention was the chaat. We ordered the samosa chaat.  The chaat actually contained normal amounts of samosa as opposed to one small piece of samosa and just tons of sauce. The samosa and the chole were very well prepared and it wasn't drowned in sauce. It was also fairly big and it was more than enough to feed two people.  Other things worth mentioning: we had two white guys playing the sitar and tabla, talk about ironic but the fact is they were really good sothere was a live music component.  The place was also packed and there were people waiting outside to enter which I have never seen at an Indian rest. in the valley  so something is working. Finally, the food was priced fairly. We ordered 3 dishes, 2 naan, 1 rice, 1 appetizer and two soft drinks for $44...not bad for an Indian restaurant..the same would have cost us about $10-$15 at another Indian restaurant.   This place is worth taking a date to or  a group of friends as it's ambience is hip enough that if you don't like the food, your friends won't think you took them to some cheap restaurant.  In other words, it's a good place to take people who have never eaten Indian food.  My recommendation is that you arrive before 7:30 because after that, the place gets packed.  If you go before 7, the crowd is mostly non-Indians and the date crowd.  After 7, you have large groups of Indian families dining and so the waiting line can be extensive and the tables can get packed.    My only criticism (if there is one) is the lack of enough of waiters and the length of time it took to bring the food out. We ordered our food at 7:05 and didn't receive it until 7:40 and the place wasn't busy at the time. Therefore, I could imagine that it could get much worse if you get there past 7:30 or 8 PM on Friday and Saturday.

After dining here a couple of more times, I would have to give this restaurant 3.5 stars. The chicken tikka was VERY DISAPPOINTING. It was not served on a sizzling clay plate as it should be. The chicken did not taste grilled.  It was microwaved and served on a plate. The flavor was also lacking. Honestly, this is very amateurish and they simply cannot serve tandoor like this.  Also, the water was not served chilled with ice, it was served tapwater temperature and thus your thirst didn't feel quenched.  The vegetarian sabjis outside of palak panner and malai kofta was average.   Again, I dined here two more times after this and the quality of the food took a dip.

5 stars    I'm Indian and I've reviewed more Indian restaurants in the Valley than probably anyone on Yelp. I was not expecting this place to be so good based on the earlier reviews. However, there is a reason the food is much better; new ownership (including new chefs) took over 20 days ago. This is probably the reason the last 3 reviews were 5 stars because they were within the period when the new owners took over. The food is truly worth 5 stars and I was debating if it was better than Guru Palace for the best Indian restaurant in the valley and Guru Palace slightly edges it but it's close.  The malai kofta is the best in the city and replaces Royal Taj has having the best. The chicken tikka masala was flavorful and had a perfectly nice tomato flavor as opposed to just tasting like cream. The palak paneer had the perfect texture but it was slightly underseasoned and undercooked but still very good. I still think Royal Taj has the best palak paneer in the city.    The only real complaints were the naan and rice. Don't get me wrong, it was good but I've had much better naan elsewhere. It was a little hard and thin but still tasted fresh.  The rice was fairly standard of most of the Indian restaurants in Phoenix in that it was dry(overcooked) and had too much cumin. Thus far, Guru palace has the best rice in the city.  They did the little things well. My Kingfisher ale was served in a chilled glass and the beer itself was cold. Sometimes Indian restaurants can serve warm beer. The papad wasn't burned and it was crisp and non greasy.   The service and vibe was nice. It seems to be owned by a young Indian couple who were very nice. They speak great English, are very trendy and friendly. The wife served us and she was great and very friendly. The restaurant was really clean and spacious as well which were pluses. Also the location was easy to find, it's at the southeast corner of McKellips and Scottsdale Rd in south Scottsdale.  The owners mentioned they will be renovating the inside so I have a feeling it will look more trendy and resemble Guru Palace and Dhaba. However, it's fine as it is now because it's really clean albeit slightly bare. I would say it's in the top 3 and the only other 5 star Indian restaurant in the valley besides Guru Palace and Royal Taj

Continued excellence! Their Tandoori chicken was served hot and sizzling on fajita plates and not microwaved on dinner plates which is a good sign and tells you this is the real thing! If an Indian restaurant does not serve grilled Tandoori items sizzling, walk out of the restaurant...it's not authentic!

Yes. we understand, the owners are friendly. I too like the owners. They are a sweet couple.  Now regarding the actual place itself, skip it. It's amateur food and I mean that sincerely and not as an insult. The person preparing the food is not a chef or a professional cook by any means. It just sees as if some random Auntie and Uncle decided to lease a space and start cooking fast food versions of Indian food thinking: "These dumb Americans have no clue. We will call it Chicken Tikha Masala wrap and they will think it's cool"    I'm Indian and i had a hunch this place was like that but I was bored and decided to pay them a visit and try this authentic food. After all, if the food is great, then I could care less if it's faux Indian food.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala "bowl"  I asked them if they could add some sauce to it and the owner responded: "Yes, many customers have asked me to do that so we started to do that"  First of all, chicken tikka masala without sauce is like eating chicken soup without water...it doesn't exist.  And what makes this story even more odd is that when I got the chicken with the supposed added sauce...it was still dry.  It had literally one teaspoon worth of sauce over some very dry and poorly cooked rice.  And I paid 10 bucks for that.  Needless to say I didn't go back.  Look, I'm not insulting your intelligence. I know you have eaten Indian food at an actual sit down Indian restaurant and that this is supposed to be good in it's own manner as a pseudo fast food version of Indian. Hey, fast food Indian...love the concept...I'm down with that....unfortunately, it's already being done in bigger cities and it's much better.  Even fast food indian has more flavor than this place.  Furthermore, they are slow.  You don't walk up, pay 5 bucks and walk away with chicken tikka wraps 5 minutes later. You walk up, pay 15 bucks and wait 15-20 minutes for one Auntie to microwave your food in the back.

With regard to AMber W.'s points  1. I'm rating the food not the containers or the owners 2. If it makes you feel better eating subpar food because of the American Spirit so be it. Others of us are more concerned with the food itself. 3. I'm not downgrading it because it's not a sit down restaurant. Even among non-sit down restaurants or "fast food" style Indian themed eateries, this place is subpar. I've eaten at quick Indian eateries and they are much better than this. 4. My review is for people who understand and can appreciate good Indian food. It's not for people who value text service, nice containers and chatty owners. 5. I want to support mom and pop and locally owned restaurants but I also want to support good ones and not encourage bad ones to emerge simply because there is no competition for Indian themed restaurants here.

In most cites, the W hotel is a place of well educated and chill people who are looking to have great conversation and relax...aka business travelers, physicians etc. Scottsdale ruined the W concept and it is trying to be an upscale club much like the Sanctuary tried to do back in 2000. That's not the vibe people expect from the W. The staff at the W are mixed. Some of the bouncers are gentlemen and professionals who appreciate educated people while the others are trashy meatheads who act elitist for no reason. It's hit or miss and you could have a very bad experience if you run into the wrong bouncer. One of the bouncers lied to us and told us our contact/manager at the W didn't exist. When we called our contact to meet us downstairs, he escorted us upstairs, bought us drinks and reprimanded that dumb 20 yo bouncer who was trying to act above his pay grade. Nonetheless, juvenile tactics like that should be held at Martini Ranch not the W. This is supposed to be a classy place.  On a positive note, the waitresses upstairs are very nice and not fake. They are beautiful but friendly and didn't have unnecessary attitude.

I think the respondents below haven't bothered to think that Karate for Kids is ideal for many parents like myself. We are not looking for our child to be the next Bruce Lee, UFC champ or Bar Fight specialist.  Many of us are looking for a place that instills values, discipline and basic martial arts in our children. I like how they have patience with kids and work well the parents. We are looking for an extra curricular activity for our children and like the discipline, respect and self defense that comes with karate. I guess for you UFC fighters, this place doesn't cut it, okay. But for the soccer moms and dads who want their kid to be in a supportive environment in which their kid is having fun and enjoying this, why am I going to complain?   Regarding the belt factory comment...maybe they are but once again, I say fantastic! There are also dojos that deliberately hold students back and don't advance belts because they are trying to be selective and elitist. I don't want that either and there are plenty of those places around. I'll take a belt factory any day.   With regard to price. Name a cheap martial arts center? You won't find one. They are all expensive and they all have their catches. You don't have to spend a lot if you don't choose to. Most of the students don't engage in weapons training so it's silly to imply all students pay for weapons and that's part of their expenses.

I got the impression that his success from Yelp got to his head. I felt he was somewhat arrogant. He was busy doing a job when I called and he seemed almost upset by that. When else was I suppose to call...at midnight? He didn't really care to take my number. He said he was booked 6 weeks in advance and asked me to call him back in 6 weeks to see if he has any openings then. He was not friendly on the phone in my opinion. He seemed as if I was burdening him. Obviously, his established clients are going to rave about him and he will bend over backwards for them. But if you haven't used his services, I would probably try someone else who is more eager and wants to please. This is just my opinion.

A lot of people have complained about this place and justifiably so. I can echo their sentiments. I don't mean to boast but unlike the majority of the people who go to the W, my friends and I actually do have money and are educated. We are the type of people who frequent the W in other cities yet in Scottsdale, we couldn't even go upstairs. We even had a contact a the hotel. We requested the bouncer that we would like to speak to this contact or employee at the hotel. The bouncer lied to us and said he didn't work there. Well, we called that contact on his cell phone, he immediately greeted us, apologized, reprimanded the bouncer and bought us a round of drinks...true story. Nonetheless, this is the type of juvenile ASU hack job tactics you see at Devils Martini not the W.  Nonetheless, I don't mean for this to be another long rant that provides no help to readers. I would recommend this place. The poor economy has kept the 30,000 dollar millionaires at bay and the childish attitudes of the hotels employees' with it. We were treated differently a few weeks ago. The bouncers at the door were nice (although the guy standing by the Sushi Roku entrance still made us walk all the way around to the door instead of just letting us pass which was remniscient of the old ways), the waitresses upstairs were very friendly and real. They let us sit at a reserved table and didn't make us buy a bottle. We tipped her generously and she took care of us. The people were also less "Jersey Shore" like if you know what I mean. It was the W as it was meant to be and not another trite Scottsdale "wannabe LA" scene that we saw when it first opened.

Avoid this store and go to the Chandler Mall store if you care about quality service. The sales clerks at this store stand around and chat with each other rather than asking if you need help. We were planning on purchasing two Macbook Airs and 3 sales clerks were chatting with one another at the display table next to us. They were not working but  showing each other pictures on their phones. The store was not busy. When we finally got a clerk to help us, she acted as if she was too busy to offer any service. There was a sense of entitlement in the clerks and they didn't feel like it was their job to offer you service.  We got the hint and rather than waste our time begging for service, we went to the Apple Store in the Chandler Mall. Just as we predicted, someone approached us and asked if we needed help. The clerk spent more than enough time with us and we bought our Macbooks from him. The Chandler store was busier than this store yet that didn't stop them from providing great service.  This is not the first time I've experienced bad service at this particular location. I prefer to purchase Apple products from the Chandler store but we were waiting to see a movie at the iPic and had some time to burn. Sure enough, the predictably lousy service was there and we decided to walk out and buy our Macbooks at the Chandler store. I'm curious if a manager is even present to observe their employees standing around and chatting with each other.

Being Indian and having eaten at many of the best Indian restaurants in the valley, I'm not your usual casual diner who knows nothing about Indian food. I usually eat dosa and South Indian fare at Woodlands (Ray and Rural). I tried Cafe Krishna for a change. I was disappointed. The service was lousy. The waitstaff was not rude and in fact they were very friendly but the wait was too long. We ordered an appetizer and two dosas. They took a 30 minutes to bring us our appetizer and another 30 minutes (1 hour) before we got our dosa. It was not busy when we ordered. There were only 3 couples in the restaurant at the time and they had 3 waiters. They never checked on us and we had to flag them down to get our bill. One of the waiters is an Eastern European woman who spoke no English and had never waited tables before. She brought our chaat to our table and didn't even bring plates with it.  The food itself was good but not noteworthy. Their chutneys were not tasty or flavorful. The coconut chutney at Woodlands is a lot better. The dosa had very little sabji (potato) filling and was nearly entirely just one large crepe. The dosa at Woodlands includes much more sabji. I did like the sabji and thought it was better than Woodlands because it was slightly less greasy. The samosa chaat was not good. It had very little samosa (maybe two small pieces of one samosa)  and the rest of it included vegetables. It wasn't bad but neither was it tasty.  The only positive aspect to the place was it's ambience. Despite its "cafe" name, the place is a sit-down restaurant. It's nicer than many full fledged Indian restaurants in the valley. It was clean, spacious with many booths. and decorated well. You are seated, given a menu and a waiter takes your order. It's not like Woodlands in which you order at the register. It has a full menu but it's vegetarian. It's also a South Indian place so I wouldn't recommend ordering saag paneer and North Indian dishes because South Indians don't know how to cook North Indian food.   I will not come back because the service was too slow. Even when we flagged our waiter for our bill, there was another couple who had sat for 15 minutes and had not even had their drink orders taken. Honestly, why would I wait an hour to eat Dosa when I can go up the street and eat at Woodlands and get the same quality dosa in 10 minutes. I'm pretty forgiving of slow service if the restaurant is super busy or if there is only one server but this was different. You could tell the waiters had no previous experience waiting tables and had no sense of urgency. They didn't know how to refill drinks, check up on you, bring your bill to you on time. It seemed like they were related to the owner or were part owners and tried to be servers. If the restaurant improved their speed and service, I would recommend this place. Hopefully that will improve

Didn't return phone calls or text. I understand one may be busy and overwhelmed with work but a simple call back is basic professionalism. There is always time to call a client back and inform them you are unable to accept new jobs at this time. I would recommend calling a different electrician. It doesn't matter how good someone is if they can't call back or be available.  I called Dodge Electric, another 90 + reviewed 5 star company on Yelp. Dodge picked up the phone each time....yes, each time I called. I think they are organized and have someone designated to answer calls and make appointments. They had great communication They were booked out but they still fit me in.

Ahh...the catch 22 of Yelp. You get so popular that you can afford to not return calls. Troy is great when he actually shows up and does the job. The first time he came over, he was great. He was fast and did a decent job. His rate was relatively fair, it could have been better but it could have been worse. When I called to arrange a second job, he didn't return my call or text for weeks. And I'm an established client of his who tipped him an additional $50 the first time. It just seems like he is busy and doesn't care about etiquette. I won't use him again but then again, I value reliability and professionalism. I'm looking for a handyman that I can rely upon for multiple jobs for many years and this won't cut it.

Two letters WT!  Simply put, there are too many drunk trashy guys who try to start fights here. The management does little to offset that. We know someone who got his car urinated on by a random drunk person and then that drunk person had the nerve to fight and assault him with 4 of his friends. Yeah, we are talking WEST SIDE type of mentality here!  The owners and the establishment don't do enough to screen their clients. If you are an educated professional that dresses well and thinks fighting in bars is a little white trash and high school then this place is not for you.  Bahama Breeze was nothing special but in early 2000, it at least attracted a crowd that was somewhat educated, trendy and held good jobs. Sandbar is full of people who don't have enough money to party in Scottsdale so they come here instead. I live 5 minutes from this place and I will never come here again. I would much rather drive to Scottsdale.  I wish this place had a cover and a drink minimum because I would pay generously to keep the idiots out.

5 stars for ambience 3 stars for food  Okay, let's get one thing straight, it's NOT the best place for breakfast in Ahwautukee or the East Valley; I don't know what is, but I do know Crackers on Elliot and Hardy offers better food. The appeal of this place comes down to it's ambience. It has a very urban feel and reminds one of the breakfast places in San Francisco or any large cosmopolitan city. Everything from the black chalkboard menu to the funky sodas to the Emo/Snow Boarder waiters who yell your name out. Think La Grande Orange in the East Valley! You order at the register and they bring your food to you. You get your own silverware and sauces.  It was also suprisingly quick.   The pancakes came with peanuts, caramel syrup and whipped cream. Honestly, it would have been better with nothing on it. The toppings did nothing for it aside from making it too sweet. The pancakes themselves were what sold me on it as they actually had flavor instead of being like your typical IHOP or McDonalds pancake that is flavorless until you drown it in syrup. The Turkey sandwhich was good but largely because of its bread, other than that, there was really nothing special about it either. I feel like even Teakwoods, the sports bar on Ray and Kyrene has sandwhiches that are more unique like its BLT with a fried tomato.  We had the pancakes and the turkey sandwhich. Both were excellent but both also had something missing. I would probably come back here for the combination of the ambience and the food as opposed to the food itself. I wasn't blown away by the food but the place was a lot of fun because it's unique. We certainly need to support more places like this if we want more non-chains.  The bottomline is it's worth going to because it's fun and it's a great place to take people. Nonetheless, it's clear people have allowed the ambience and vibe to affect it's opinion of the food. The food is good but not noteworthy

I got a quote from Urias. They were not very friendly on the phone. When they showed up in person, they were not much better. The owners are a husband and wife team. The husband and his crew do the work, the wife manages the business. They were not rude but they were not friendly either. They were very direct and unaccomodating. They had a "take it or leave it" approach. They were not flexible regarding when they could come. They said "We come to your area on this day of the week and you will have to have it done this day or you can't use our service" They were not flexible about scheduling either. They would not allow me to hire them just for the summer or 6 months out of the year. They said if I use their service, I'm required to hire them year round.   The one positive was their pricing was fair. They were not asking for an arm and a leg like most of these landscaping companies. They were asking for $100 for the month which is pretty reasonable. But what ultimately made me decide not to hire them was their lack of flexibility and their high volume business approach. It seems like they do a lot of homes. I got the feeling that if you were not happy with their service or wanted something extra, they would not accomodate you. I would rather pay more and have more personal and flexible service.

Very salesy and pushy IMHO  I arrived with the intent purpose of test driving a vehicle. I was very upfront with the salesman when I arrived. I told him I was interested in a certain line of luxury vehicles and wanted to test drive cars in a particular class. I told him I wasn't buying today and wanted to make an informed decision. I showed him my 90K Mercedes outside to show I was a credible client and not someone just wasting his time.  I told them my intent was not to buy today because I wanted to test drive the Audi, Mercedes, Lexus etc before buying. Even after telling him this, he sat me down on a couch. He asked me a lot of unnecessary questions despite knowing I was there to test drive a car. When I test drove the car, the salesman was very condescending. I look young so I assumed he thought I was a kid in my early 20's  even though I'm in my late 30's and a professional. He was a back seat driver and was directing me turn by turn. After the drive, he didn't drop me off at the showroom. I had to ride with him back into the garage where he applied more pressure sales tactics. He then re-asked many of the same questions he had already asked. He asked them in different ways and assumed I was an idiot and didn't recognize his cheap tactic. We then stopped on the second floor so I could "use the bathroom." His desk is on the showroom floor which is the first floor. They stop on the second floor to further delay you and engage you in further conversation. Then we took the elevator down to the first floor. He then walks me past his desk to re-ask the same questions he had been asking me all day. This was essentially their last ditch effort to see if I would purchase a car from them. The salesman even mocked his own tactics. He said "The chances of you returning are about 30% when you leave the door so what can we do to sell you a car now."  When I asked about pricing, the salesman said he doesn't know anything about numbers and that pricing was done by "them."  I gathered he just shows you the vehicle and they bring in a closer to work the deal. This is pretty typical of most dealerships. The salesman is the "good cop" and the closer is the "bad cop."  I eventually left the dealership but not after wasting an additional 30 minutes of babysitting a salesman who thought he was being clever in applying these tactics. I expect this at a GM dealership but was very surprised to witness this at a premium luxury dealership.   I test drove  cars at Mercedes and Audi across the street. None of their sales representatives were as pushy as the Chapman BMW reps. None of them called me after my test drive. They were intelligent enough to recognize that if I was interested in buying a car from them, I would call them. Just from the pushy and overzealous sales tactics, I would never buy a BMW here. I would rather buy a BMW from another state and ship it than do business here. I just got a very bad vibe from this place. I would encourage the sales manager to not encourage aggressive and pushy sales tactics because most of us who can afford BMW's are professionals and don't appreciate those types of tactics. We are buying a BMW not a Chevy. Act like it!

UPDATE: RESPONSE TO BRIAN LEE of Chapman BMW BELOW    With all due respect, it is out of the ordinary to push for a sale when the client explicitly states they are there to test drive a vehicle and will be test driving other vehicles prior to making any decision. After test driving the car, I told the sales person that I would need to test other cars before I know what I want. That is pretty self explanatory. What else do you need to know?  Asking the same question in 10 different ways for the purpose of trying to close a deal is pathetic.  I test drove cars at Audi and Mercedes. None of their sales people used these tactics. They respected the fact that I wanted to test drive other vehicles before making a decision. None of them tried to detain me or resort to these tactics.. None of them kept badgering me with the same question asked in multiple ways: "So what is the next step"  How likely are you to buy a car today? Tell me what you want to do next? What can we do to get you to buy today? If we offer you a great deal, would you buy this car now? What is your plan after you leave the dealership?  Are you trading in or paying cash? What is it that you don't like about this car?"  If you think that is just someone trying to "sell cars" then you clearly don't understand the concept of professionalism. Obviously, we share philosophical differences. A professional does not badger a client. They provide information and then respect the client's autonomy and decision making ability. Since you seem to espouse your salesman's tactics, I will be thoroughly avoiding your dealership and will choose to go elsewhere to purchase my next BMW.

They were great. They replaced my BMW M6 windshield in April. This is the same company that the dealerships use. They arrived the same day at my home. The installer was efficient and did a clean job. The sensors were installed properly. There were not parts falling off. The glass was oem. The technician was neatly dressed and polite. I would use them again.

This is an amazing physician. He spends as much time with patients as they need.   So David S., should Dr. Weiner have an egg timer and start it at 15 minutes so that when your Grandmother's visit is over, he can dismiss her so that the next patient can be seen on time? Dr. Weiner probably spends more time with other patients rather than kicking them out of the room when their appointment is done.  And your solution makes little sense.  if he removes patient slots, that means your Grandmother wouldn't be seen today or probably this week. And his practice is a business like anything else; if they don't see a certain number of patients, they can't afford their overhead. And what do you think happens when a physician is on call with the E.R.? They are probably attending to a patient which means unforeseen events happen.  David S.  Yes, he would go bankrupt if he scheduled patients according to your desired schedule. This is a medical practice not a barber shop. You cannot control every element in medicine. Unforeseen events happen. You can't compare it to a retail business.  Waiting for 100 minutes is not uncommon particularly with a surgeon who was taking call in an emergency department.  Many orthopaedic surgeons take trauma call. Should Dr. Weiner avoid repairing a shattered femur in an auto accident so that he can make you happy and be on time for your grandmother's visit? Did you ever consider why so many patients are willing to wait to see Dr. Weiner? There are plenty of orthopaedic surgeons in this city. Did it ever dawn on you that Dr. Weiner has an excellent reputation and patients are willing to wait to receive excellent care. Medicine is an art; replacing a knee is not the same as replacing your brakes. There are plenty of people who are willing to wait to receive excellent care. I would much rather be seen by someone who was late but then takes their time with my appointment than someone who kicks me out when my appointment is over.

After undergoing many poor experiences with other local nanny services, the Perfect Fit Nanny service deserves mention. Janet, the owner, personally interviews all nannies prior to referring them out to you. The other agencies would send us resumes of candidates that they had never met or really spoken with. Every resume we received was already a qualified candidate and we CHOSE to interview every candidate that was referred to us. Not one of the candidates they referred to us was bad, in fact we liked every candidate they sent to us. It was just a matter of finding one that was a better fit. Some of the other agencies sent us resumes of candidates that were such a bad fit that we didn't bother interviewing them.  I would also like to discuss their professionalism. They returned all of our phone calls and e-mails immediately. Candidates were immediately e-mailed to us. Although they asked for an application fee, they didn't wait to send us resumes. They didn't complain about our time or requirements either. Each candidate's resume was neatly typed and attached in a word document along with references. One of the poor nanny services we used had the audacity to scan their hand written answer sheets onto a PDF file!   Some of the things I mentioned sound like common sense or basic professional etiquette but in the Phoenix area, you would be suprised at how unprofessional most of the nanny services are. This was the only service that was worth mentioning. We immediately stopped using those other services and only used the Perfect Fit Nanny.

The price range for this service is grossly above average when compared to competitors in my opinion. I was quoted $27.50 per maid per hour and they send a team of 3 maids. They informed me that my home would require 3.5 to 4 hours per cleaning which came out to approximately $245-$280 per cleaning per their quote. This was approximately $100 more than estimates from upscale clearning services on Yelp in the Phoenix metropolitan area.  And this was not a one time cleaning or deep cleaning. This was for scheduled routine maintenance which they typically give you a lower rate. Furthermore, they never responded to my e-mail and I had to call them to get this estimate. When I called, I was on hold for a long time. In my opinion, I would recommend calling around and getting estimates before committing to this service.

"New York Style" is a term that is thrown around by a lot of mediocre Chinese restaurants in the Phoenix area.  I think half of the restaurants that use that term have never been to New York and don't know what real Americanized Chinese food tastes like. I think an even bigger percentage of the people on Yelp who claim to judge New York style Chinese food have never been to New York either.  Yeah, New York style isn't authentic Chinese food and it's never been authentic Chinese food. If you want chicken feet and other authentic items, go elsewhere because that's not New York style either.   New York style Chinese food is an Americanized version of Cantonese food.  This place is the only Chinese restaurant in the Valley that can lay claim to New York style Chinese food. Trust me, as a New Yorker, I grew up ordering Chinese food down the street and this is the real deal. The egg rolls are the best I've had in the Valley and all the dishes have that great Cantonese flavor. Their seafood particularly their shrimp dishes are cooked perfectly; they are not overcooked so that their shrimp is rubbery yet they are seasoned well enough that it doesn't taste raw or uncooked.  If you want straight up New York style Chinese food...the kind you can get on Elizabeth street, come here.

I would have never used their service if I had known they would harrass me with repeat sales phone calls. They continue to bombard me with sales calls years after they replaced my glass  Even after requesting that they not call, they continue to do so. This is very unprofessional in my opinion. I would not recommend them based on my experience. I have used Penske glass and had great experience with them and they have not bothered me with repeat sales calls.

How does anyone say that Hooters doesn't have the best wings? If those same wings were served in a mom and pop pub in Arcadia or Midtown, there would be 150 reviews with 4-5 stars. But because it's Hooters, food snobs will reach to find fault with them.  The service is outstanding. I've brought my rowdy 3 year old here and they are always gracious and patient. Let's talk about their service. A lot of restaurants in the Valley could learn a lesson or two about service from this Hooters. The waitresses check up on you constantly making certain your drinks are refilled, dirty plates are removed, and making certain you are happy with the food. And unlike many Hooters, the waitresses don't have attitude here. They are not wannabe models or actresses. They are nice looking friendly hardworking girls who do a great job. There is no attitude or pretense here and this is precisely why I will drive to this location rather than their Scottsdale or Phoenix location. The food is always served hot and crisp which isn't always the case at every Hooters. I don't give 5 stars very ofte

For a place that claims they don't reheat food, it's ironic because the buffet had the quintessential "reheated Indian buffet food" taste. Make no mistake, this is a South Indian restaurant through and through. They can say "North Indian" dishes on the menu but it tastes like South Indians cooking North Indian food. Sambar is in nearly everything and it tastes sour which can tell you where the chef is from. The place was hot and muggy inside. The place had an odor and it just felt really dirty in there. I won't be coming back

Okay BBQ for Arizona, Mediocre for Everywhere Else  It's receiving 4 stars due the dearth of BBQ joints in the Phoenix metro and people are so desperate for BBQ that this place gets rave reviews. Honestly, I think Honey Bears is far better. There are several flaws with this place. The pulled pork comes with NO BBQ sauce; yes it's served dry and mushy and you have to apply your own. I've never been to a BBQ place where the pulled pork is not served in sauce. The ribs are tiny and the meat does not fall off the bone; the meat is actually quite tough. For pork ribs, the meat is supposed to fall of the bone and be tender and succulent. The baked beans had no flavor.   There is no chicken on the menu, only turkey.  The sauce itself is underwhelming. They seem to be preoccupied with the idea that "heat" or spiciness makes for a better sauce. And that couldn't be further from the truth. We are talking about BBQ sauce not salsa. The best sauces have flavor not heat. Their "sissy" sauce was actually their better sauce. Their "original sauce" has too much crushed red pepper and almost has salsa like undertones.  Finally, the fact that you don't get a container of sauce when you order take-out is bush league. They have these tiny packets of sauce that resemble tiny packets of butter or margarine at a diner.  Any respectable BBQ establishments gives you a container of sauce to go with your food. And unfortunately, you need more than a container since their food is pretty dry and devoid of sauce.   Sorry but Phoenix deserves better.

San Prado is like an American luxury car. They look great but they fall apart and are not reliable. That was my experience with Prado. The service was fine until something broke down and then they were slow to address things and worked on San Prado time. Appliances frequently broke down. The soap dish in the shower fell off. The A/C broke and they took their sweet time to fix it (over a week) and had no sense of urgency to address. Their maintenance man was incompetent and couldn't fix issues and would try to rationalize why certain things wouldn't work because he didn't know how to fix it "It can't get cooler than 75 degree if the temperature outside is 99" Hopefully things have improved since I lived there but if I had a choice, I would definitely look elsewhere.

There is no "Premium" in the Phoenix Premium Outlets. Those of you expecting to find the same premium outlets that you find in Palm Springs, Orlando and Las Vegas are in a for a rude awakening. Unless you consider Banana Republic high end, you can forget it. There are no Gucci, Prada, Diesel, Burberry and the likes. In fact, there is really no reason to come here at all. You can go to any other mall or shopping area in the Valley and get better selection and service. In fact, just go to Casa Paloma down the street on Ray and I-10 and there Banana Republic over there is much nicer. I don't really know who they are catering to with this mall but don't be surprised to see this mall die in 5-10 years much like the Casa Grande outlets. After all, why go here when you can shop at the same stores in the Chandler Mall which is indoor and offers a better selection and isn't much more expensive. The parking is limited. The design to enter and exit is cumbersome at best. There is no appeal to coming here. The owners of this mall better find some quality stores in a hurry or this thing is toast.

This review is really for Dr. Kathleen Kuhlman, M.D.  at Valley Perinatal. After the tech performed the ultrasound, we were concerned because the images were not that great and still had concerns. Due to an abnormality on previous films.,Dr. Kuhlman personally came in and did the ultrasound herself. She was very thorough and explained each image and its significance. She also elaborated about medication conditions related to our baby. She relieved our concerns due to her intelligence, compassion and ability to discuss communicate technical issues well. We only regret not seeing her sooner. I would highly recommend Dr. Kuhlman and wait to make certain that I was seen by her on each visit.

I'm not opposed to higher prices. In my opinion, you get what you pay for. High prices keep the riff raff away and you won't witness meatheads trying to pick fights or be obnoxiously loud here. If you are looking for a lot of cheap food, go elsewhere, there are plenty of hole in the wall sports bars in the area to serve you.  It's nice to have a more upscale sports bar in the area. The area has needed an upscale sports bar for a long time. Nabers provides great service with a very personal touch.   I would request the following from the owners if they really want to make this a special place.   -Be loyal to the local teams. Show ASU, U of A, Cardinals, Coyotes, D-Backs and Suns games. You would be surprised how you can walk into a sports bar and not find the local game on. To make matters worse, the staff will be rude to you if you ask them to put the local game on. Don't be the typical Arizona bar that leaves the channel on ESPN 2 displaying World Poker Tour instead of the D-backs game or the Coyotes game.   - Provide fast and reliable Wi-Fi. A lot of fantasy football watchers require it.   -Offer valet service on NFL Sundays during football season. Parking can be a pain during this time and the option to drop off your car and walk in is a nice luxury  - Offer a VIP room on football afternoons and special sporting events for die hard fans who are willing to pay more for more personal and accessible service.   -Consider offering an online reservation ability where you can reserve, schedule and select your table during football Sundays when it is really busy for an additional fee of course.   - Secure the parking lot or have a parking lot attendant. A lot of fights, hazing and vandalism occur at night. People are less likely to do this if the parking lot is supervised.  -Know your customers on a personal level and remember their names. Call them by their respective titles unless they tell you otherwise
