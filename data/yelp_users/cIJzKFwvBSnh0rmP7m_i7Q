I have now learned to avoid The Network's Bar and Grill.  The main reason is the poor service.  Anytime anyone pops in staff should greet the customer  These folks ignore customers frequently.  SIX times this year I was TOLD that the Downtown partnership 20% discount is NO longer accepted - which is a bold face LIE.  The restaurant staff merely HATES to deal with their inept manager who HIDES the required computer card for this discount from them.  THANKFULLY there are DOZEN'S of options only steps away.  Although I've been to the Networks OVER 3,000 times since it opened some 15 years ago, it now will be my last stop if that.

Last night I finally had a chance to try this wonderful spot in Downtown Phoenix - What a lovely surprise.  I will let you all be surprised but please be sure to include this hidden gem in your line up when visiting downtown or if you live downtown like I do then why haven't you been here already - just like I've been asking myself for nearly a year.  Good eats await you!!!! I loved it all, especially the eel.

After a lovely day of training in class for the private TSA friends introduced me to Detroit Coney Grill - Being a Detroit native I was excited to go there for my first time.  I enjoyed the best priced and quality Lamb Gyro I've ever had in AZ.  Thank you Detroit Coney Island, Tempe, AZ - I'll be back SOON!
