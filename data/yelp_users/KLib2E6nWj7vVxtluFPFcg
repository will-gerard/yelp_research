Started off with chicken spring rolls which were presently very well. They were light and crispy and came with a sweet sauce that paired excellently.  I ordered the Gia Katchu. It was a very tasty dish. The sweet sauce with onions and peppers made a good combo. However, the chicken had to be frozen and breaded somewhere else based on the look of them. I was disappointed about that.   My girlfriend ordered the Holy Basil Chicken. It was a bit spicy for my taste, but she enjoyed it. The chicken was seasoned nicely and was topped with some items I did not recognize.  Overall, great presentation and pricing with this restaurant. We will visit again. Highly recommended for Thai food lovers.

A very thorough welcome visit. I was not expecting such exceptional pre-screening measures. Dr. Jones was very professional and suggested multiple options for my treatment. I am very glad I was referred here.

I ordered the Mediterranean pasta and added shrimp. I'm very glad I did because the dish tasted excellent.   I chose this because of a recommendation from a couple sitting next to me that I happened to see eating that same dish. I'm glad I took their advice.   The pesto-Alfredo sauce was the highlight of the pasta creation. That, combined with the spaghetti noodles and feta cheese made a great flavor explosion! The kalamata olives added an extra salty taste that I didn't enjoy too much. I just don't like those type of olives.  I also sampled the cheesey bread with marinara sauce. The sauce tasted like it had been made from scratch. Highly recommended to order anything that includes that sauce.   I will be visiting again to try more dishes!

THIS REVIEW IS SERVICE BASED ONLY!   Let me paint the picture for you, Sunday night about 630 pm. There is one,15 top(approximated) on the patio, and inside there were 8-10 other tables with 2-4 people average at each of them. There were 4 total waitresses, 1 hostess, and 1 bus boy. Every waitress had approximately four tables each.  After we were sat, we place our order within 5 minutes. We ordered 1 salad and 1 pizza. First of all, it took 45 minutes for them to bring out the WRONG salad! Then it took about another 8 minutes for the correct salad to get delivered to our table. Our pizza took another 20 minutes to come out, which was somewhat understandable because of the other large table.  Our waitress came by sparingly to bring us waters and ask about our food. However after our pizza was delivered, she asked how it was, we answered briefly, and she scurried away, not asking if we wanted our EMPTY drinks refilled. We ended up having more interaction with the hostesses/ than our own waitress.  I caught her numerous times texting on her phone and talking with non-dining patrons (i.e. her friends) all night. Also, multiple times she looked at our table and walked the other way, and because of that, it felt like we were getting ignored.   At the end of the almost 1.5 hour dinner that should have been no longer than maybe an hour, I had to get up and go to the new bartender (who came to work on his day off because of the dysfunction of the waitresses) and asked him to cash our check. The reason for that is because yet again, our waitress JORDYN, was talking to her friends at the hostesses stand. He promptly took care of it and apologized for the service.  This was the worse service I have ever had. It's unfortunate because the food is great here. Overall, JORDYN had chances to provide better service, but decided to text and chat instead.

My girlfriend and I were searching yelp for a quick breakfast stop and landed here.  I ordered omelet with the bagel and a small coffee. Very affordable! Great value for the money.  And it was delicious.  My girlfriend ordered the sausage breakfast sandwich and really enjoyed that as well. The family is very friendly and wasn't afraid to talk to customers.  Also, as we were leaving, the son offered us free pastries to try and we gladly excepted.  I had the cream cheese filled and my girlfriend had the apple filled. They were both exceptional pastries! We will definitely be back! Always nice to support local business!

Pork tacos are GREAT! The pineapple in the tacos wirh the feta cheese is excellent! Papas bravas weren't really good. Chicken burrito is tasty as well. Verde salsa was pretty quick,  to much lime flavor though.  Fast and friendly service. Will visit again!

Ordered 4 rolls to go. They were: California, Las Vegas, Doraku #3, and the Shrimp Tempura.  The biggest stand out to me was the Doraku #3. The combination of all the ingredients along with the spicy mayo and eel sauce was excellent. I assume those are the in house creations (hence the name). It is nice to see such a delicious roll created by the chefs there.  The California and Shrimp Tempura were pretty standard from what I have had before. I am no sushi expert by any means, but they were good. The Las Vegas was overpowered by the fried outside. Now, it is under the category of "fried roll," so I expected it somewhat. However, I which the flour coating was lighter so I could taste more of the contents inside the roll.  Overall, I was satisfied with the meal and the price of the rolls. Next time I decide to get sushi, I am going to dine-in to check out the vibe in the restaurant.

The pizza is EXCELLENT here! Highly recommended for pizza lovers (which means everybody!)  Our meal started off with an appetizer; spinach artichoke dip. Overall, we thought it was too creamy for that sort of dip. It seemed to me to be packed with fatty ingredients because afterwards I felt extremely full (which usually is due to fatty foods). However, we still liked it, just thought it could be better prepared differently. The menu said the chips that came with it were made in house, but we couldn't taste the difference.   We had create your own pizzas for our main course. It was a great price ($9 with two toppings, $1/ extra topping). I ordered sausage, spinach, and pepperoni. My girlfriend ordered sausage, red onion, olives, and prosciutto. The one thing that put this pizza on the map was the SAUSAGE! It had a delicious, fresh taste to it. Also, we both thought the sauce was savory as well. It was on the sweeter side, which we both enjoyed. Other notes, the crust was thin and very crispy, the cheese wasn't overbearing, and it was a big pizza for the price.  We also had drinks. I had the Oak Creek Nut Ale. That had a sweet taste to it which paired nicely with my pizza. My girlfriend tried the white tap wine and didn't like it, but then ordered an Australian red wine that she enjoyed.  It was a slow night, but the service was good. They generously pour the glasses of wine (seemed like a 2 for 1). Also I appreciated the manager coming over to ask us how our dinner was.

The pizza was delicious here. We ordered the Margarita and the Bocca Trio pizzas.   The Bocca trio had a well rounded flavor to it. The Sicilian sausage tasted great and in my opinion, created the natural flavor for the pizza.   The Margarita pizza had a sweet sauce with the mozzarella cheese melted on top that made for a delightful flavor combination.   Overall the pizza was thin, with a thick crust which is what I enjoyed most about the pizza. The dough didn't overpower the ingredients on the pizza.   Great ambience and well decorated. This will be a place I definitely visit again.

MY RATING HAS TO DO WITH THE SERVICE NOT THE FOOD. THE FOOD WOULD GET 5 STARS EASILY!  Starting off positive, the food was excellent! I ordered the Roasted Chili Glaze wings and they were, BY FAR, the best I have ever had! The other guests in my party ordered the Hot, Honey, and Hoppy wings, and the Southwest Americana burger. I tried both of those, and they were delicious. The wings had a nice kick to them without being overwhelming and the burger was the same way. The goat cheese balanced out the gigantic, fried pepper perfectly. QUALITY ingredients and well sized portions. For the food only, I will be visiting again.  Now for the reason I gave a 2-star rating. It was a busy afternoon because of the ASU vs U of A game, so I figured service might take a little longer than normal. However, the amount of time we waited and the lack of attention our waiter gave to us was not what it should have been even with it being busy.  We started off ordering beers and that came out to us at a reasonable time. Then our waiter, Scott, took our order. We put in for the wings, burgers, and an appetizer (chips and salsa) to start us off. After 10-12 minutes of waiting I started to look for Scott walking around the restaurant to grab his attention and ask for our chips, but he was no where to be found. And the few times I caught a glimpse of him walking around, he never visited our table. Our meal took about 18 minutes or so to come out, which was fine wit me, but he never gave us our appetizer or even acknowledged that he forgot it.   About 10 minutes into dinner, one of my guest's wanted a refill for the beer but again, our waiter was no where around. When he finally came to our table about 3 minutes later, another one of my guest's asked for a water (that he forgot to bring from the beginning) and before the guest who wanted a beer could even ask, Scott walked away too fast to even get a word out. By that time, we just had our mind on getting the check.   It took another 10 minutes to get the check processed because Scott hadn't come back to get our check, so we gave it to another waitress to get it done. Overall, we felt like we were the guests shoved into the corner and forgotten about. In my opinion, there were not enough staff working for how many people were there. That could have attributed to the lack of service and minimal attention needed to serve our table.

My friends and I stopped here to eat on the way back from Prescott. First of all, the cashier never greeted us. I ordered a char grilled bbq sandwich by itself,  and when I told her that she had to get her manager to punch it into the register. My two other friends ordered specialized meals and they messed both of theirs up as well.  It took 10 minutes to complete my order and 15-20 minutes to complete my friend's orders. They messed both orders up and they had to be remade, tacking on another 5 minutes to the order time.   Overall, the service there was horrible and they couldn't understand simple instructions when we ordered the food. Other customers in there looked like they had the same issues. The manager on duty didn't look like she knew what she was doing, so that didn't help the situation at all either.

First time eating here tonight and I ordered a chipotle chicken sandwich. Overall, it was an average sandwich. It came on a grilled panini with the grilled chicken and the sweet, chipotle sauce.   The sauce was a little too sweet for me. It was a pretty small portion for the price. I had the macaroni cheese as a side and that was excellent. Great tasting cheese flavor to the noodles.   The other members of my party had different types of salads with baked potatoes and they loved it. I tried the potato and it was pretty good. Loaded with cheese, ham and turkey bits, tomatoes,  and onions.  I'll come here again for another sandwich, but was impressed with the one I had.
