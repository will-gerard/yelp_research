If you're looking to get into shape with no excuses on quitting then this is your gym! Sweets, the owner and trainer, is amazing, he knows exactly what he's doing and always has something new for you so you're constantly working out your whole body. I love this gym/ bootcamp.

If I could have given this place a 0 I would have, the food is mediocre but what makes it terrible is the customer service. My boyfriend ordered his Ty Cobb with extra chicken and steak and the person on the phone explained it would be an extra $3-4 which was fine. We got home with the food and there was barely any chicken and barely any steak at all, what's the point in paying a lot extra when you don't even receive it? So we called the manager and told him what the problem was and all the manager, Mike, could say was "I'm sorry you feel that way". Really? That's the response we get? Sorry but for the price we paid for the food and the quality we received we could get something far better and give out business to people who actually deserve it.
