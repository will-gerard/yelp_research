top notch professionalism.  I love the way their billing system works, sends me an email to remind me that they are coming, and automatically bills my account/CC.  Very easy.  Their staff is clean cut and the folks that answer the phone are very competant and informative.   We had a serious scorpion problem apon moving into our home in March and now six months after starting service, we have none.  Blue Sky told us exactly what to expect in terms of bug activity in the first couple months of service, and has been right on.  I highly recommend them for peace of mind, customer service, and getting rid of bugs!

Visited six weeks ago with a sprained wrist to get an X-ray on the weekend. Front desk staff person intook my insurance information and told us (definitively) that they take our insurance and that our out of pocket would be 10%.  In fact they are "out of network" for our insurance (Cigna) and nothing was covered.  She should have known this being that she intakes insurance cards all day long and that they are always out of network for Cigna patients.   Had she not misspoken we would have gone to a different urgent care (Cigna apparently has their own urgent care facilities) that was in network.   I just received a bill for $450, for a wrist sprain, all because this company's representative at the front desk gave us false information about our insurance coverage at their facility.  I urge you to seek honest healthcare elsewhere that has the patient's best interest in mind, not the company's bottom line $.  This is an example of our broken healthcare system. It's companies like this that are more concerned with money grabbing than helping people.  (I will also add that the nurse that helped us had a bad attitude about working there).  We will be reporting this to the better business bureau and Arizona health board.  And will never go there again.
