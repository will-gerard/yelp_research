ALWAYS a good choice; service, food & atmosphere. If you're not in the mood for pizza,try the "Pablo Picasso Salad" or the "Alfredo the Dark" pasta!

I LOVE Flowers by Jodi! She did SUCH an amazing job on my wedding last year and I have recommended her to many of my friends since!  Her flowers were so so fresh, her staff-so sweet, and she is just a joy to work with! It is truly refreshing to find someone who loves their job as much as Jodi does! Thanks, Jodi for a great job!

Another P.F. Changs that didn't disappoint! I came here with my mom recently and did the 2 for $40 deal. It is A LOT of food for the price and we ended up taking some home, as usual. The service is always good and the food is consistent. Love P.F.'s

Devina is amazing! I have sent others to her and they always have the same experience! She is literally the only person in the valley that can get my blonde right! If you're a blonde, or really any hair type, ask for Devina.

Einstein's and I have a usual love affair. This being said, I was extremely dissapointed in this location.   The entrance is awkward and they are usually understaffed. I love their bagels and their fresh squeezed OJ......"Fresh Squeezed OJ"---- is usually from concentrate at this store. Being an Einstein fanatic, I can tell. At first sip. That this was a frozen juice concentrate. Other Einstein's have a tangy, sweet OJ.   And the shmear:   Eisntein's is usually known for globbing ooey gooey, delicious and ridiculous amounts of shmear on their bagels. This Einstein's seems to scrape the bottom of the barrrel to get enough to cover your bagel.   So sad as this is really close to my work but it looks like I'll have to continue to go to Shea or Desert Ridge for my Blueberry Bagel, toasted, with Strawberry Cream Cheese.

We come here almost twice a week, and love it! This morning, while running late, I asked my husband to pick up milk for our daughter. I called whole foods and Diana was kind enough to bring the milk to customer service so my husband could run in and out w our toddler. Impressed that a large chain still has customers at the heart of their business. We will continue to shop here.

This was one of the most pleasant shopping experiences I've had since being pregnant. The service clerk was soo friendly and helped me find the perfect outfit for my baby shower. I was only in town for the weekend and she helped me with what was the perfect outfit, then piled me up with coupons to local stores and stores in my area in TX. I really loved working with her. Ask for Bernadette!

We live right up the street and instead of our usual run of the mill breakfast spot, we tried rustic. This place is amazing for families! I usually get the Denver omelette w a pancake and I cannot tell you how much I would love to be able to eat the whole thing, but there's no way-it's huge! Kids meals are $2.99, can't beat it, especially when they aren't finished half of the time! The service is pretty good, could be friendlier but they are always really fast and never make a mistake! We come back here all the time and will continue to!

My Husband & I met some friends for lunch here while we were in town. The wait was about 20 mins, but we were seated on the patio, where there was live music and a beautiful view of Scottsdale & Camelback! I ordered the Market Sunflower salad; blackened chicken, goat chz, bacon, dried strawberry, blueberry, sunflower seeds  & my husband the Smoked Turkey Ciabatta; gouda, bacon,sweet tomato, roasted red pepper aioli. I LOVED my salad, but the hubs was a little less than totally satisfied with his sandwich, however the sweet potato chips were super yummy! I would definitely come back!

Love this place! I grew up in Scottsdale and recently moved to Dallas. Upon coming back I noticed that the neighborhood "car joint" was transitioned to a local restaurant and bar. This place us by far one of the best new developments in Scottsdale! Order the green tea lemonade and ask for Stefan!!!

I am cringing as I write this; My husband and I have a 1 year old so date nights are at a minimum for us. This being said, we try to sneak in a 'date lunch' here and there. After reading some stellar positive reviews, we decided to try Rehab Burger Therapy out. Parking was fine, we got into a good spot right away, but as soon as we walked through the door, we were disappointed. We stood in the doorway for a few minutes before anyone noticed us, were sat and ignored for at least 10 minutes. We finally ordered and the server returned 5 minutes later because she 'forgot to take drink orders'. 25 minutes later we were served our food... this is the only reason I gave this joint 2 stars-- the food. The Hawaiian burger and sweet potato tots were so delish, but still didn't make up for the super disappointing service-- after all we didn't lunch until 1pm so it wasn't swamped. We will try again, on an occasion where we have more time bc the food truly was yummy!

I am slightly OBSESSED with ChopShop! After moving back to Arizona from Texas I was sad to leave my favorite health food haunts behind, but ChopShop cheered my right up! The Green Glory is my favorite: think sweet green, spicy ginger and subtle kiwi. To die for. I love to pick up a couple sides of quinoa..it is the perfect portion for a quick go to in between meals. So happy I found this place!

Looked for a new place for lunch today. I love Mediterranean food and thought we would try this place out. The service was good but the food was sub par. Hummus needs more garlic and lemon :(

I've been here twice. The first time it was amazing, the second time I bought a bottle that was supposed to be good until tomorrow. Drank it this morning and have been extremely sick all day. Although it seems like a great place I would be weary to try it again.

Although I usually love Target, this location is always lacking. The staff is rude and the baby section is tiny! They never seem to have anything in stock and when you ask them they grumble and tell you "everything's on the floor" always. Everything is always on the floor? Hmmm
