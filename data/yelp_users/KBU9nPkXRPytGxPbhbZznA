Ordered online to pay in store.  Total was $23. Got to the store and they tried to tell me their website was wrong,  it wasn't their fault,  and that they wouldn't honor it and that I owed them $45.  For the inconvenience they'd give me 15% off. I said I wouldn't pay that much so to just drop my order to 2 pizzas since they advertised them for $8 on the front sign.  Went to pay and they said they wouldn't accept the gift certificates I had as payment for a discounted pizza. My husband made a comment about it being ridiculous and that we were leaving and the man behind the counter says "get out before I make you get out" and starts antagonizing my husband trying to get him to fight him screaming out the store even as we're in the parking lot.  How ridiculous is it to think they don't honor their prices... Their gift certificates aren't as good as cash...  and that you may get verbally assaulted by the cashier (and who knows maybe even info a fight if you aren't with someone that can walk away). Even with the $50 in gift Certificates we were given we will not be supporting this business.

Verve has been an all around awesome "business". The reason I say "business" is when you are there it is more like family. They are always smiling, listen when you speak, and can actually have intelligent conversation. The facilities are gorgeous, clean, well kept, and top of the line. It's even better when you don't have to be referred from one office to the next as they have it all in house. I've been going there for 12 years and have no intent to leave. I've referred numerous friends and family who have also referred friends and family. Word of mouth is a powerful thing and these guys (especially Dr Warkentin) deserve the praise!
