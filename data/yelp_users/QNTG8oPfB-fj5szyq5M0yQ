I was visiting my best friend in Scottsdale and she knows how much I love wine so she took me here because she knew I was Chairperson of the American Wine Society in Los Angeles for over 3 years. The ambiance was great. It was dimly iit and offered comfortable seating. The space was pretty large, but well used. The wine list was the best part. There were thousands of bottles to choose from. I am very selective about the wines I drink and Peter, the owner, was very helpful in finding us the right wine. At first the bottle I wanted was not available, but Peter made sure we were taken care of and got us the perfect bottle to finish off our evening with. If you are looking for a great place to enjoy a delicious bottle of wine, I would highly recommend Kazimierz.

Don't EVER even think of calling this company. The first time we called them to use them we called at 7pm for an 8pm pick up and requested a 6 person van. They said no problem and gave us a confirmation number. They then called back 20 MINUTES before the cab was supposed to arrive and said "sorry we don't have a car for you after all." Needless to say I would not even consider booking with them. We are now screwed as our dinner reservations are at 8:30pm and every other cab company is quoting us an hour wait, which would have been fine had Vip TAXI not LIED to us.  DON'T EVER USE THEM!
