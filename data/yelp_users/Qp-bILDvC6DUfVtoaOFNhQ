The Black Mountain Coffee Shop is a great gem of a breakfast place.  Family owned and family staffed, you can't get a better place. I'm a little nervous about leaving a review and tempting the yahoos to come... So if you're a yahoo don't come here and screw it up for everyone.

Been coming to Pita for years.   In general the food is great and the service is good.   I am however sick of their inability to change the really bad things.  Every wrap I've ever had here has tin foil in it. They wrap them in tinfoil and then cut through them with a serrated knife that causes little bits of tin foil to be in your food. Every time I have one, I tell the staff and their response is "I know, I've told the cooks, but they just keep doing it."   I'm done going to Pita,  who knows what else the kitchen is doing to our food.
