They serve Lux coffee! Definitely a good idea to have a place like this to hold you over until you can have pizza. And the art work in here has always been really good.

FATIGO PLAYS HERE! Great venue for anything from music, spoken word, to improv. The art work tends to be a hit or a miss, but I do love this place. $2 PBR!!!

Looking for good ethiopian in Arizona? Look no further. The food is fresh and packed with flavor, the injera is soft and warm, and the owners and waiters have always been so sweet to me. OOOoooo!!! They have vegan coffee cake!

They're open late, they're cheap, and it's the tastiest indian food you'll find in town. The began barta is out of this world good.

I used to love coming here for hookah and hanging out with friends. But the ASU frat boys found out about it and the place but isn't what it used to be. The foods gotten really bad too.

Only reason this doesn't get 5 starts is because of the college crowd, but this is such a wonderful bar. The oyster's rockefeller are superb, and your get that with some Guinness and your totally set. There's smoking outside, and if you live in the area you'll always run into someone you know

I wish Chris would come up to San Francisco and open a resturant. I cannot find pizza here that's even near the same level of his wood fired pizza's. You do need to show up at Bar Bianco about 2 hours before you want to eat, but it's worth the wait. The bread, the salads, the wine and the PIZZA... all fresh and tasty and... damn, I can't wait to visit AZ again!

Best cappicino in Phoenix, the artwork is always amazing. But do not ask the barista to make you something that's not on the list or if they have WiFi. Other than that, this place is great. Oh, and the italian toast with blackberry jam..... *starts drooling*
