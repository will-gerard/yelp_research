Who knew Miami would have the best Pizza in the area?  We were there last week attending a show next door, and swung in the New Miami Cafe to grab a bite to eat.  The service was GREAT, pricing is perfect, and it's cool to be able to eat on the patio and enjoy the music.  We will definitely be making this a regular spot!

Quite possibly the worst Chinese food experience I've had in my 10 years in the valley. Not only did they show up one hour and 30 minutes after their 45 minute guarantee, when I called the person told me that he "couldn't be responsible for what happens on the road". To top it all off when the driver got here, he barely spoke English and was clearly not comfortable with driving around the valley... Honestly I feel sorry for him... They shouldn't do that to who was clearly their relative. Burger King here I come...

Love the authenticity and the service is great.   They also have a great bar with all the wine and liquor you need.
