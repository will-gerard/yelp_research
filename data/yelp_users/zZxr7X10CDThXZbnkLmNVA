The worst customer service I have experienced in my life. How is it possible you are even in business?

I am NOT surprised that this store is the lowest rated in the area.  Excuse me, I have a return.  It's unopened but I bought it more than thirty days ago.  I DO have the receipt and you still sell the product, Linksys router.  Mgr:  I'm sorry.  We do not take returns over 30 days.  Me:  If I didn't show you the receipt, would you accept it?  Mgr  Yes, but you did show it to me.  Way to go mgr, you got me there.  Took it to Frank Lloyd Wright store- they accepted it immediately and told me they didn't care when I bought it but, could only give me a store credit.   Good job guys, got me for $1.75 in gas.

Ordered hot corned beef and wife ordered a cheeseburger at 230pm. We were the only ones in the place.  I asked to please wait to make the corned beef until the cheeseburger was ready.  Ok, no problem.   Paid the $21 and went to a table.  Within 2 minutes, the corned beef arrived.  I asked for the 2 meals to come together, young lady.  "Don't worry, your order will be right out."  Fifteen minutes later, it came.  Corned beef was dry and tasteless, cheeseburger ok for eight bucks.  I agree with another review, this place is just an overpriced sandwich shop with bad service. Not sure what is special here, if anything.

The  petco near me was out of my boys favorite off the rawhide bar so, I called this store and asked if they had a rawhide bar. Yes we do--  Hoped in the car to make the six mile drive  Excuse me?  Where is your rawhide bar?  Oh I'm sorry we font have that anymore.  There are a few on the endcap over there.  Really?  Excuse me, do you have a water bowl where my dog can get a drink?  Yes, in the back of the store by the restrooms.  Uh, theres no bowl back there.  Well, maybe thats because the water fountain is broke.  I will tell the mgr tomorrow. How does that help me now?  How much  did those rawhides weigh?  .93lbs.  Over on the other scale, it was less than .75.  Let me weigh it again--oops now its .95. Really?  Here's a review you can do over the phone to get a 2 dollar discount.  I REALLY DON'T think you want me to do a review and I wont be coming back anyway  Ok, have a great day, sir

How do you guys stay in business?  There are so many choices in the valley.   Ordered a taxi due to the $15 for first ten mile deal to the airport. Waited on the phone for 6 minutes( not so terrible) before getting to an operator. She told me the taxi would be 20 minutes. That was fine. It actually came in less than ten, bonus!  As Craig was putting my bag into the trunk, I asked him if he participated in the deal I was looking for. His answer " I just charge what's on the meter, if you want another taxi, that's fine ". Wow, really?  He then added that it was more than 10 miles from my house. I know that, I've gone to the airport dozens of times. (It's actually 12.2 miles). Maybe because he's an independent contractor, he doesn't have to give the deal but, why did you send him?  Carla took the complaint, told me no mgr was available.   There are so many choices in the valley guys, look at these reviews. Do you see a pattern?  I won't hold my breath waiting for an apology from yellow taxi

My wife and I were helped by Carlos pick out a mattress, huge purchase for us, we're working people. The main selling point he kept stressing was to lay on the mattresses and decide which one (in our price range) felt the best. If there was any problem, we could exchange the mattress within 30 days for another, no problem. This guy seemed totally sincere so, we picked one out and waited for delivery.   After sleeping on the mattress for one night, we were extremely disappointed. It was lumpy, sagging, and hot, not at all like another we had purchased at a competitor a few years ago for similar money. After 3 more nights, we had had enough. Both of us had backaches and my wife had chosen to sleep on the sofa!!  I called the formerly very friendly salesman and explained our situation. He INSISTED that we must sleep on the very uncomfortable, hot, lumpy mattress for a month before he could consider an exchange.  He would not consider anything at all at the present time ( we MUST wait a month!!)  Are you serious???  He was not so friendly anymore. I called Serta, the manufacturer and talked to a manager who told us that R and S was NOT an authorized dealer and that the mattress tag I photographed and emailed to him indicated the mattress was made and sold by Serta only to QVC.  This one was sold over a year ago. They had no idea how the mattress was being sold by R And S but, speculated that it might have been a return to QVC and bought by them.   Guys, please check this for yourself before you buy a Serta from them. The customer service number for Serta is listed everywhere. This does not apply to Brooklyn, a brand which they manufacture. I'm assuming that is true. However, Carlos said the Serta was less than $100 more and, was a better buy.   There is no way I let this stand!!   This is now my very first disputed charge on my credit card in 25 years.  I've already made calls to corporate and Serta, and tomorrow calls to local consumer reporter.   Thanks for reading.  10/06. Exchange completed by another location.  Seems fine.

Rented a town home from the Yuppie couple from hell last week. They had a bad experience with prior tenant and I'm paying for it.  Came to the house several times to walk through but didn't notice the horrible smell of cat urine in areas of the carpet, baseboards, and closets in some of the rooms. (My bad) Jacob, came on time and after hearing me explain the problem, got down on his knees with his black light and after 20 minutes, identified a dozen areas with cat urine and urine crystal residues which stunk.  He applied a Chem Dry product called PURT and told us that things should improve in 24 hours. They definitely did and, carpet is way better. Still might have to replace the baseboards but, urine stench is much improved in carpet area.  This company is a franchise and I highly recommend both this technician as well as Brimley. Thanks guys, highly recommend.

We haven't been here in a while, too far, but, tonight decided to make the drive.  This is an extremely comfortable place to eat, the booths and the lighting have been redone since my last visit.  The quality of the food and the service are both really great here.  The house crispy chicken and the Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce are my favorites.  The others had beef chow fun and pho 19.  The spring rolls here are somehow better than all the other spots with what seems to be the SAME ingredients.    Laurie still remembered us and what we  like after almost a year.  We will be back soon.

Super kudos to the manager working tonight, Holly.  I had three separate issues/gripes which she addressed very professionally.  As I was shopping, she came up and gave me a $3 coupon for my inconvenience.   Notice to corporate-- this is the kind of customer service you should strive for in all your stores.  This store has definitely stepped up its look and its staff.  The trainers here have also been super nice/helpful

The food here is good basic Jewish deli food.  I especially love their bagels but, had to walk out tonight as five people behind the counter couldn't get to me in over 15 minutes.  I was second in line.  They were NOT busy at 8pm.  The people in line with me were not happy either.  Ill be back tomorrow for some more bagels.  Maybe I will have a better experience.

I moved to be close to this park and Talking Stick.  I can walk here in three minutes and I do, often.  My dog loves coming here and so do I.  Somehow, the Scottsdale park workers keep this place pristine despite, the tremendous amount of use the park gets  Great combination of walkers, bikers, fishermen, kids, and dogs.  If you do have a dog, please be sure to clean up his poop, ok?  There are plenty of bags and trash cans.  Lets keep it nice for everyone.

Went in for two pair of inexpensive glasses to back up the ones I currently use. They told me they don't have the "2 pair for a hundred" anymore but, they do have a buy one- get one sale in progress. Ok, it's been six months and prices go up, I understand.   Picked out two inexpensive frames and asked for a price with my script. $350 for the first pair and the second one free. That's an increase of 350% in ~6 months.    After calling another store, found out that I was overcharged for the lenses. Return policy is liberal so, I WILL be returning them.

Just a brief review to let you know that this is STILL a great local business that deserves your bagel business.  Small shop with 5 outside tables and seating for about 40 inside.  The bagels here are crusty on the outside and chewy inside.  Staff is friendly and efficient.  Place your order at the counter, pay, give cashier your name, and your order will be delivered in less than 5 minutes.  They have about 4-5 blends of coffee daily and, they offer free coffee with a yelp check in. (must order at least a bagel)  Prices are reasonable and they do have a punch card for dozens

Great food. Absolutely HORRIBLE service, actually brought wrong food, didn't bring drinks at all, didn't fill waters even once, didn't clear dishes and didn't bring check.  They were not busy, the waiter just wanted to talk with his friends,  As my people say, NEVER AGAIN!

Corporate,  are you listening??  Although I admit, I love your product, what the hell is going on in this store?  While I was waiting (26 minutes) for my order for two, THREE different customers came back in to say their order was wrong or incomplete.  Laura, your counter lady, handled it as best she could (2 stars are for her only)   I believe all the orders originally were through the drive thru. I have been to this store many times and have only gotten lucky to have a good experience two or three times.  I refuse to go to the drive thru anymore, the order is either wrong or the chicken is extremely small. At 5 in the evening, you should not be out of ANYTHING, especially your most popular chicken choices.   This location is run worse than the VA. Heads must roll; it's the only way to get right with us.   Ps. Please keep Laura. She's full of personality and quick.

Why do I continue to come back here?  Because its the only place open to get an ice cream float. Consistently wrong orders even when asked to repeat the order back. Daytime is a little better with about 50 percent success. After 9 pm, no shot.   What is the name of the district manager please? Uh, uh, you mean the store manager?  No. We don't have one. Left messages for the store manager twice. No callback. Filled out the 10 minute survey- no feedback. Your products are not horrible but your service is the worst. Step it up guys.

What happened Boston Market?  You used to have a nice nutritious meal at a great price point. Now, portions are very skimpy, veggies are limp, turkey is full of gristle and, worst of all your gravy is horribly watered down. Still a notch above other fast food but, what happened?  C'mon, you can tell us.

Checked in, went ok, not busy but,  NO FEEDER LINES, just stand in front of any clerk--- ARE YOU KIDDING welcome to the 20th century, very unfair if you get a slow front desk clerk or a problem guest in front of you by accident.  Ok, in your defense, they still do lines this way in Cambodia but thats it, Myramar and Thailand use one line now.    Cmon, wake up management., anyone?  Went to my room and immediately tried to turn on the TV--nope, nada  Tried to open the curtains, you know, the shear ones, nope totally stuck closed.  Called front desk, handed off  to facilities, was told it would be at least 30-40 minutes to send someone up.  (And they want me to gamble here)  Called front desk supervisor-- he said he would reassign me a new room and my keycard would work, really great, things are looking up.  Ok sir, room is on the same floor xxxxx.  OK, glad I didnt unpack, thanks.  Of course the keycard didnt work, now I am getting a little upset and I havent even lost any money yet..  Called back from phone in hallway.  Security came up and let me in pretty fast, good job security and thanks.  Only problem is I lost a set of earbuds to my i phone going from one room to another.  Checked back twice with security, no luck  Crap, down 35 already.  Anyway, I think someone looked out for me here.  I gambled at this hotel 6 times and won 6 times, (oops went 2 for 5 at other places)  This hotel is badly datded and really, really needs a makeover.  The prices are ok but for just a little more, you can stay at a nice property. Please do

OK, I'm pretty sure this review wont get filtered like a lot of the good ones.  First, thanks to Kristen for messaging me back and saying she was real.  I needed a mover in 2-3 days and this was the highest rated company that could make my dates.  I talked with Jim, the owner, confirmed the price and date and was feeling good enough about him to give them my Amex card and a substantial deposit.  They arrived right in the one hour window I was given.  They called when they were ten minutes out.  The crew I got was Ray, Joe and Miguel.  They all introduced themselves and got right to work.  All three had moving skills for sure, sometimes working as a team and sometimes alone.  I have moved basically the same stuff with three guys five times and they came within 15 minutes of the record speed.  They shrink wrapped almost everything which is why they didn't beat the record.    They were not as cheap as the valpak coupon movers but, the difference in level of care, speed, and professionalism was well worth the small difference  I would use them again for sure and I highly recommend.  Thanks, guys

Sometimes the billing offices simply make a mistake.  Be nice, explain the situation, and they are happy to correct it.  NOT STATCLINIX!!!!! I paid the copay in cash before the treatment, per your policy.  No, I didn't ask for a receipt but, that does not mean you can charge me again.  The copay is clearly on the card and I gladly paid it upfront, as you requested.  I WILL NOT pay it again!!  I wonder how many $20 -$50 co pays are paid again just to get rid of this monthly bill?

My second time here was as good as the first.   This place seats about 40 people but only three booths.  The rest are 4 top tables with about 4 tables on the patio.  This place is nothing special to look at, located on a pad in a strip shopping center but, the food is very, very good.  Tonight we had the spring rolls, summer rolls, pad thai, and kung pao chicken.  All the dishes were just perfect with the fresh vegetables cooked to perfection.  Portions are generous and the price is right.  This is a vegetarian joint so be aware, the chicken is NOT chicken.  It is run by a husband and wife team out of Hawaii (wife cooks, husband serves)and they definitely have their following of regulars.  The muzak is 60s-70s generation which I enjoyed.  Great value, great food.  Will be back for sure.

When I see a service business with reviews like this across the board, there is really no decision, I'm gonna try them.  I made my appt with George 9 days out.  He told me I was going to be the third job of the day.  Do I need to confirm, George?  "No, Ill be there around 1 pm.  With these stellar reviews, I never gave it a second thought and woke up this morning and moved my furniture onto the tile/outside.  He called when he was 10 minutes out.  Arrived on time, gave me the price (sq footage, I was only off by 16 on my guesstimate) finished the job in a little over an hour.  Super nice guy, totally dependable, good price, good results.  Highly recommend.

Petsmart is happy to sell me food and toys, even classes to train my dog but, if they classify him as a pit mix, he is not welcome at the hotel or daycare.  BSL ( breed specific laws) are really  outdated guys.  You're supposed to know this as a leader in the industry.  Please boycott this chain if you agree.  Help spread the word.

Took my dog to a new day care ranch for the first time and was waay out of my neighborhood.  Yelped a couple massage places to kill some time and this one looked good, called and, they were able to get me in for an immediate appointment with Amanda, just 50 minutes but, better than nothing. right?  Recently, I have made the switch to the Asian Foot Massage scene where you can get 90 minutes for less than $50 and its really good almost always.  If this place was closer to me, I would switch back to the in and out full body.  The receptionist/owner, Kathleen was nice, the therapist was in my top 5 of all time, and the facility is super clean and comfortable.  The price is reasonable and yelp saves you $5 more.  They close early 3-4 nights and the prepaid only saves you about $4 a massage but, if you live near here I highly reccomend this place.  This place is so good that I would not review it if I lived closer.  Wat????  Yup, selfish of me but, I did this with one spot and after a while the receptionist was ALWAYS saying  "Im sorry but, we are booked for today.  How about Friday at 9 am?"  The cat was out of the fxxxxxx bag!

Have gone here 3x in the past two weeks. Passed on the foot massage but, got a chair massage. A little price, ($35 for 30 minutes) but, what an excellent job by Yoyo of hitting all the spots I asked for and really applying firm pressure as requested. If your a little bored with the standard foot or table massage routine at your favorite place, I highly recommend a back, shoulder, neck, head rub siting in a massage chair. Much better pressure in this position. Truly wonderful. Ty Yoyo.

Last minute appt with Joanna  Nice, professional, good pressure.  First time customer, price is good, but jumps too high after the first time.   I have been getting a lot of massages lately to help fight the stress those damn 20 -40 players keep infusing into my life;  This place would be good if I wanted a membership, where they debit you monthly but, after my massage envy and LA Fitness fiascos, I would just like to pay as I go.  I will never give my cc number to a gym or salon again.  Note to Laurie (if you are reading these, please check my spelling and STOP beating me every hand we play!!!!)

I almost always stop here for breakfast on my Costco runs. This location is always clean, bright,  and the breakfast  is always good/great. Just seems less greasy and fresher somehow. Today, we both enjoyed some crepes off the holiday menu. They were outstanding.   As stated in other reviews, your experience here is highly dependent on how busy they are and your server. Ours was excellent.  Happy holiday Miranda!

Was stuck with this company through my insurance. No less than 3 different lies told in less than two hours. They must be the "stock lies" and 3 different people must not have checked with each other. They are 1. Sorry, you got caught in a shift change. Lol 2. The drivers truck had mechanical problems.  3. The dealership where your driver is now won't pay him.   Gave one star because the driver was nice. Seemed shocked when I tipped him. "Dude, I'm not mad at you. You just work for a horrible company"

You make a great point and we are looking at a new format to prevent these issues...Thanks for bearing with us as we figure it all out.  Warm regards, Molly  Larry L. Yesterday It's not that hard. Take a damp paper towel and erase the wrong prices. Let dry. Write in the correct price with colored chalk. Hope I've helped with your issue   Not a big deal for me but, most don't like being overcharged. Oh wait, they actually weren't  overcharged right?

I will be surprised if this place is open another 6 months. Not because we were the only ones there from 6-7, not because you couldn't find a bag for the carry out container, not because the food was bland and tasteless. Because there are so many other great choices at Mekong that try to at least appear to care. Step it up or step aside.

I am fully aware that in 2015 any negative review/feedback of a holistic, homeopathic, natural healing or eastern medicine office will be viewed with skepticism but, feel I must write an honest review of this center which reflects my experience. This review does not reflect my view of any of the above practices rather, my experience with this office.   Before coming, I was unsure which of the two yelp offers I should choose so, I called and talked to the receptionist to get some advise. She was crystal clear that one offer would target my pain while the other was more of a general sense of well being. I went for the first offer since it was only $5 more. She said I should come over right away. I thought that was odd but, cool with me.   I arrived at the clinic and immediately paid my $50 for $75 deal. I was given a brief tour of the clinic by the same girl who booked my session and booked my immediate appointment.  After a short wait, I was greeted by Dr Xiao and given an extremely detailed schedule of her fees for various services. She seemed overly concerned with the price plans to me and, I told her that I was NOT READY to commit to any course of treatment after 5 minutes and, would just like the $75 acupuncture treatment I had paid for, whatever it was.  Her reply was that she was not familiar with the Yelp offer on her own web site but, would treat me for the introductory price I had already paid. GREAT!!  I was escorted to a private room where she proceeded to put about 20-25 needles into my body. While I was face down on the table, a second woman asked me if it would be ok for HER to put needles in as well. I said yes, I mean that seemed fine but, I would have liked to know if she was a Dr. or just someone learning.   They set a timer, gave me an emergency button to press and left the room telling me they would return when the timer went off (15-20 minutes). In reality, it was at least another 15 minutes after the timer went off before they returned.   I was once again given a price breakdown on the next session ($165 including massage). I told them that if I had any pain reduction, I would be back for that session in two days.    I was instructed to take it very easy for the next 4-6 hours.  WAT????   I was on my way to train a dog, a VERY physical activity. Don't you think it would have been wise/proper to tell me this BEFORE the treatment??  I was offered some herbs for $24.95 as well.  (Pro tip; Make the price $25). When I asked what kind of herbs they were so I could google them and make an informed decision, I was told sciatica herbs, a mixture they make there. WAT??  Are you kidding, really??  I declined.   OK, HERE WE GO!!  As I was walking out the door, I was told that I owed another $75 as Dr Xiao had given me an (extra special treatment).  WAT????  We had already been through this but, the three ladies in the office insisted that I owed them MORE MONEY.  At this point, I felt like I was in a used car dealership but, decided to pay it on a cc and dispute it later (which I told them I was going to do). They clearly knew I was very upset and reiterated that, charging me AFTER the treatment was grossly unfair/malpractice..  I received TWO calls after I got home, one from Dr. Xiao and one from the office mgr.  Once again, they pleaded ignorance of the yelp offers, and told me that my experience was not the norm. They were both eager to tell me how wonderful they were to their patients and, I would NOT be charged an additional amount after all.   Two days later, I received a letter from the receptionist taking the full blame, offering me a COMPLETE REFUND and an additional $135 gift certificate.  Nice gesture.  After waiting a week, they had STILL NOT refunded/credited my account.  1. Bait and switch offer. 2  Upsale attempt on herbs they couldn't even name. 3. Post procedure instructions that were impossible to follow. 4. Treatment by an unknown person asking my permission after treatment had started  I believe acupuncture may be beneficial but, this is NOT a new office trying to find their way. They seemed predatory to me and, I thought I would let others know. I definitely would not return (even for free)

Deffinetly nothing special.  Ordered one beef and one lamb kabob to go.  They were exactly the same.  Not sure if it was lamb or beef but dry, overcooked and tasteless.  The pita bread was ok.  If only they included something in the bag to put on it.  Since my $20 purchase was sealed in a to go bag, I did not think to ask if I needed any sauce (green stuff on the counter).  Wound up giving the kabob to my dog.  He seemed to love it btw.   Hummus was good.

Oops, Easy to write a two star review for this company.  They came two times, same guy both times, to fix a non flushing toilet in guest bathroom.  After two visits, same issue. Not a big deal cause it's hardly ever used. Called to talk to the manager. He suggested I change my diet. What a clown!! Hey bro, I told you it was a GUEST bathroom. Insulting me is not the way to go.

Lol, really????  I just read your response. The toilet that your guy worked on looks new to me. I have ZERO knowledge of plumbing. In NO WAY, would I think the toilet would make the flushing better but, THATS what your tech said. I didn't even know about the holes around the rim.  Two months later, I paid for a camera service.  Oops, big problems. Nothing at all to do with the toilet as YOUR GUY suggested.   Let's recap; I was there. You weren't I have nothing to gain by telling the truth here. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!  You have to bend the truth tremendously in order to not look like an incompetent contractor who is just lying. This is a guest bathroom and  is seldom used, has a much newer toilet than main bathroom. If I was going for a toilet upgrade, I would choose the other room.

See madison d. Review (it says it all)  I will not be coming back here despite getting my water topped off three times in forty minutes.  Only 2 carts and very small selection.  Definitely sit where the carts come out!!! They have lots of people working here but, only 2 pushing carts which are almost empty by the time they got to our section.  Price is very good and taste ok

Great concept but just doesn't work well here.  The employees just are NOT with the program. Been here three times and the film was late each time. Employees didn't seem to care nor did the mgr when I complained.  Theatre was dirty twice  and sound was way too low the other. This is how it might get after ten years, not three months. FAIL!

showed up at 940 for a 945 show.  mgr greets me at box office and says, sorry, we are done for the night, you are like the tenth person to come in but, moviefone and flickster are wrong, we close early every night except sat and sun.  Me: ok, can you give us a couple of passes for a future movie for our trouble?  We planned our whole night around this info.   Him; No, sry not our policy. Me: (a litlle aggravated) its ok, this theatre wont be open in 4 months anyway.  You guys are horrible. Him;  I couldn't care less

Went at 2pm so no problem at all with service or seating.  Our waitress, Jen, was exactly what you want when visiting a new place, very knowledable about the dishes and extremely friendly.  Plaintain chips were delicious and my friends seemed to like the cerviche.  My steak tacos were delicious.  The only problem was I could have eaten about 9 of those extremely  little devils which would have come to $36. Prices are high here but, the place is impeccably appointed, very comfortable and food seems great.

the two times I have had a full body massage here were both great.  Facial was just OK but, the coupon on the website lets you get both for 95 dollars.  Very fair price.

The tissue paper for the headrest is HORRIBLE!!  The setting is not the greatest either.  Skip the foot massage and go for the full body.  Been there 4x and all 4 were great.  Different from the standard massage envy routine, much better

Sorry to say that my relationship (~15 massages) with Zen has come to an end. I am giving an extra star because the body massage (not the foot)is still among the  best around.  However, my last visit I got to my car and realized that my neck chain was missing.  I immediately went back and although, the therapist had helped me remove it before the body massage, it was nowhere to be found in the massage room.   It had only been 3-5 minutes and no other clients were there so I'm not sure what to think. I had that chain for 30 years and can't get the thought out of my head that it just disappeared in that small room in three minutes. Oh well when one door closes another opens and I have found a new place 3 miles south on McDonald  and Granite Reef which is three for three so far.

Best LQ I have ever stayed in.  La Quinta varies greatly from property to property.  This is the top of the line.  Great staff, wonderful new facility.  Not the greatest breakfast but, certeinly adequate for free.  Ask for a room facing away from the airport if you are easily bothered by noise.  I stayed in 231 and it was super quiet.  Whirlpool king suite is a great value if you have a few extra dollars to spend..

Recently moved to a smaller town home where the smell of cat urine and cat crystals had been present from previous owner. My wife is extremely allergic and we may have to move but, thought another deep cleaning might help. Our appointment was set in an hour and the ladies arrived the very next day right on time. They looked a little confused as the house was already very clean but, explained that we wanted all the baseboards and shelves wiped down to try to alleviate the cat odor which had been cleverly  masked by our landlords.  They stayed about 1 1/2 hrs at a cost before tip of $114.99 two small bedrooms and 2 baths around 800 sq feet. They did a good job but, a little pricey for me. If it wasn't for the price per hour, I would've given them 5 stars.   Cat odor remains.

Full disclosure::  I am Caucasian and Pho is just an occasional treat for me.  I have been here twice now and I really like this place.  The food is fresh,very reasonably priced, service is good, and the owner is interested in my opinion.    Very refreshing.  We have tried 3 different pho dishes, all good.  The spring rolls are delicious, and the whole crispy chicken was perfect.  I did not love the egg rolls but, my wife did.  This place is evolving and is new but, I love their attitude.  I wish they had more booths but, that's just me  Full bar, entertainment on weekends, and the best Thai iced tea in Scottsdale.  I WILL BE BACK!

Had a small get together with some friends before my daughter leaves for Okinowa next week.  I thought this place was ok, the first couple times (see previous reviews) but, now have a couple of things to add.  The Filet Mignon Shaking Beef is delicious. The Bun Bo Hue is even better.  I skipped these dishes the first time because I was a little intimidated by the name but, that was my mistake. The Calamari is wonderful here but, you guys need some Marinara sauce to go with it.  Matt, my server was super (thanks Matt) but we had a big group so everyone chipped in whenever they could,  (thanks Nick and David)  The owner, Victor was constantly checking to make sure things were ok, they were but, I LOVED that.  I was with a diverse group 20-60 years old but, everyone had a blast.  Friendly place, good food, great value.  Try for yourself. then send Me a compliment on yelp.  I need more!!!

This review will be ONLY for the newly dubbed poker room at Talking Stick Resort.  The new official name is, "The Arena poker room at Talking Stick"  Ta da!!!  They changed the name 4 days ago from the generic,(poker room), when they lifted into place a 3000 pound state of the art scoreboard with 16 big screen TVs and a 360 degree sports ticker.  Very impressive, guys!  Poker began here in the spring of 1998 moving locations several times between their two properties until finally being placed in this new 4 diamond resort, Talking Stick (TSR).  From its inception, this poker room quickly developed into the premiere place to play in Arizona.  I believe the main reason for its instant success was the foresight of management to hire many likable props and get all the high action from other rooms instantly.  Sadly, most of the nicest props are now gone, leaving only four as of this writing.  Some of the older ones that no longer have a badge still play there and, they are GREAT.  They still make the games fun and help the dealers when they haven't learned the rules.  The Arena poker room is sought out by visitors and locals alike and is a large, fun, well staffed place to enjoy poker.  The employees are friendly, well trained, and competent (most anyway) from the managers to the bus staff.  They get most things right with the notable exception of highly touted Players Reward Club which began on April  15, 2010 but, still  to this day, has players, dealers, and managers alike shaking their head in disbelief over this state of the art(???) product distributed by Amaranth Corp out of Ca..  It is by far the main criticism of the otherwise well run room two years down the road in this gorgeous new facility...  Every few weeks or so ,there is a NEW proclamation that it is NOW working but, I for one have stopped using it as have many others.  The food can be ordered table side and  ranges from steak to a very tasty Asian menu.  High quality and great service but, the prices have more than doubled on many dishes.  It's still a GREAT value just not as great as it was before.  This room has too many tournaments to list but you can play from $60 to $1000 throughout the year,  The players seem to love the tournament action here.  Unfortunately, the tournaments now often conflict with the live games on Saturdays and Sundays resulting in mass confusion, anxious players waiting to gamble and a sometimes disgruntled floor staff who through no fault of their own have to take the brunt of the whining.  If you play poker, THIS is definitely the place you wanna come,

Went in with a friend at 3pm for a drink.  Wow, this place sparkles.  They have a patio upstairs with a great view of Camelback mountain but, too hot so we sat at the bar inside.    Our server/bartender was Melissa.  She poured a great drink or three and was extemely easy to talk to.  Ok, it wasnt busy but, this kinda attention deserves way more than the average gratuity.  I had the crabcake appetizer for $10, small but delicious and full of real lump crab.  My friend had the chicken wings with the meat pulled to the top, super easy to eat and very tasty.  As night shift began to drift in, I couldnt help notice that they all had sexy nylons(I love that look) cause Im old) to complement their black shorts.  Tasteful and sexy.  I will be back for dinner soon!

I don't eat Italian much but, I will be back here really soon. This spot has it all, great food, nice setting and great service.  The appetizers were nice but, the veal scallopini was phenomenal as was the penne.  The prices were reasonable for the high quality of the dishes.   Without question, the waitress was a 10. She took time to carefully explain each special and was meticulously careful when taking our somewhat individualized orders.  It's been a while since I had a server this good. Thanks, Diane.   Only one negative: valet parking was the only reasonable option.

Very easy 5 star rating. Can not find one negative or even neutral thing to say about this somewhat new optician/optical office  The location on the NE corner of Via De Ventura and Pima is in a new medical building which also has an independent neighborhood pharmacy.     There are several diagnostic tests pre exam which all seem to be really state of the art. Dr. McMullen himself, seemed friendly and professional. He took his time answering ALL my questions and refined my current script. I was extremely pleased with the treatment I received on my visit.   I have been going to a different guy for quite awhile but, was feeling rushed the last few visits. You won't have that feeling here.   Highly recommend this office.

I have been calm and patient. I have gone up the corporate ladder step by step. I have gotten zero results on unwanted add ons sold to me by over aggressive salesperson. This company has probably ripped off hundreds of unsuspecting consumers hoping for an honest experience in purchasing eyewear. I agree with others. Be very, very careful. Better yet, Don't buy here.

If you look at my reviews, you will see I'm kinda stingy with my 5 stars but, this neighborhood spot deserves it. Our server, Amy told us to take any seat on the patio. As soon as we did, the sprinklers went on soaking the table (no food yet) but, enough for Amy to offer a free round of drinks.   The food was wonderful. We got short ribs, shrimp tamale, and a quesadilla dish. All were excellent.   Comfortable place, good service, great food, reasonable prices. Can't beat that combo

Yea, it's different. Seating was comfortable. My medium rare burger took forever so I finally asked the server hovering to check on it. He told me he sent it back because he thought it was undercooked. Finally came out medium well ( no pink at all). Was happy to eat it and leave instead of waiting  for a third burger. Fries needed the oil changed but, were edible. Self serve drink station was far from where we we seated, might wanna rethink that. Condiments only available in small thimble cups  and far as well.    Overpriced and underwhelming.

FINALLY able to add a 5 star review ( been a while).     The strip center location is not the easiest to find so, I was surprised to see this quaint neighborhood eatery near capacity on a Wednesday night.  We waited 5 minutes for our table and were immediately greeted by a very enthusiastic server who took our drink orders and returned to answer some of our questions. She took her time to explain several dishes and cautioned us about the spice level.   We went with the pumpkin curry, steamed lemon fish and our old standby Pad Thai. All three of us were happy with the freshness, presentation and appropriate spice levels. The portions were good so, no desserts to report on, maybe next time.   This restaurant is very well decorated with art and sculpture from Thailand and,  seemed impeccably clean. I know it is more of a locals spot but, I highly recommend it for out of town guests wanting fresh Thai cuisine. It is very close to many Scottsdale hotels but, off the beaten track.    Thanks to Sha Sha for taking her time with us. Be back soon!!

Lived in South Scottsdale for five years and somehow missed this excellent spot just because I never drive down that street. We tried the most popular choices and, they were tasty. Really good comfort type food. The setup of the place is great with no problem sitting at the bar and ordering your meal. This gives the added pleasure of people watching everyone as they arrive as well as an open air view of the walking street traffic in front. Nice service from the bartenders with everyone working as a team. Love that approach. This is not a high end spot but, delicious comfort food that seems to have an overwhelming loyal base of people.

Really bad experience here, still not addressed. Either the company has a policy if adding expensive, unwanted, extras or they encourage their salespeople to do it while they turn their head.  Have spoke with General Mgr and corporate. They're NOT denying it but, so far, nothing. Next up, area supervisor, regional director, tv stations that advocate for consumer.   Guys, I'm not buying a used car, just some eyeglasses.  7/29. Received a call this morning from one of the best local consumer reporters promising a looksie and some mystery shopping of this chain. Only problem, they are 2-4 months out. I can wait.    In the meantime, I am working on getting a commission schedule. If you can help with that, please let me know. Ty.
