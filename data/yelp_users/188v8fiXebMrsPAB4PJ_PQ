Mmmmm- bread, mmmmmm. To me, the bread makes a great sandwich, and pane bianco comes through, absolutely!  The sandwiches are always fresh and I always dig the surprise of what the special is going to be each time I walk in. They are usually traditionally European in style, and hit the spot. Regardless, the stable sandwiches are fantastic, especially if you like fresh basil. It just pops in your mouth. Awesome!  If you're up for a nice picnic, get a sandwich, head over to Indian Steele park and chow down. Don't forget to look for the chocolate in the bottom of the sack!

So I must have driven by this place like a zillion times on my drive up to "Target-to" at Spectrum, and it was finally when a buddy of mine told me how good this place was that I finally decide to give it a shot.   He recommended the toasted turkey sub with the sesame bread - very specifically the sesame bread. So, sure enough, I give it a whirl, and you know, he was right.  It was a great sandwich. The other choices sounded just as good am I'm sure I'll try 'em. Oh, and the beer choices doesn't hurt towards a good review.

I'm pretty sure it's more than just the red bricks and neon writing that just screams "comfort". After having a buddy recommend this place due to a raving review of a lamb dish, I finally decided to give it a try.   When you walk in you can just smell the aroma of fresh marinara sauce. For me, that's always the first test - does the place have a good red sauce or not? Well after plowing through the linguini side that accompanied some of the best pork chops I've ever had, I can say "mamma Mia!!" (and not to Abba tunes mind you, more like to That's amore).   The special that I chose was 2 pork chops in a gorgonzola cream sauce that I found greatly enjoyable. The pork was cooked thorougly, and still moist.   I can also say that the otger staples are highly enjoyable - fresh mozzarella and meatballs get an A+, as well as some of the crispiest salad I've had in a long time (barring my weekly trips to the farmers market).   Go and mangia!

"listo, Matt listo!!" Ahh, just those three little words bring my tastebuds to tingling as I can completely visualize the Guedo Chicken burro (has a very unique sauce that you won't find anywhere) closely nestled up against a steak taco with cheese as if they are old acquaintances just getting back to each others' company.  Yes, it is pricey for the size of the portions, but I'm at the stage of my culinary travels that I no longer pine for the La Tolteca 3lb burrito for $4.99 (or whatever it goes for these days), but rather a nice quality meal with a cold cerveza.  The expansions that they've done since I first started going here back in 1995 are a nice touch and its nice to see that they survived the city of Chandler's construction problems.  They're also one of the few places in town that I can get a veggie burro/taco with whole beans, instead of ones that have been watered down with like a ton of lard and no taste.  If you want quality, add this to your list. If you want quantity, go to Chipotle.

I have to admit, the first time I went to Carly's I wasn't such a big fan. I think it was mainly b/c I didn't really care for the sides that are offered with the sandwiches, but I did remember the awesome beer selection.   Fast forward a few years (yes, I know) and it's late and I'm hungry. Ok, carly's it is! This time I went for the special sandwich and already had my expectations set low on the sides. My wife ordered a salad, and so we decided to go half-sies. You know what? The sandwich was great, and having the salad as a complement worked out well. I'll definitely be going back, oh, and yeah -best bottled beer selection going.

There's three things that I absolutely ensure that I do when I get lucky enough to travel to Germany for work - German coffee, Ritter Sports and fresh pretzels (yeah, ok weiss-bier and wurst as well!) All of which I can get authentic versions of at OHB.  Funny enough, my last trip to Munich I stopped in a grocery store at Rosenheimer Platz to satisfy my craving, and sure enough the same brands of coffee (Dallmyr, etc.) that I can get there, you can find here. Add on top of that a fresh pretzel or two, chased by Ritter Sport candy bars in German language and off you go!  At holiday time, it looks like you can get some authentic Nuremberg gingerbread cookies, marzipan treats as well as lots of different Stollen choices. Most recently I enjoyed a killer cheese danish as well.

I *really* want to give this place more stars. Like really do. The ambiance of the Wyndham lobby and this bar are slick and fun. The tap selection (kiltlifter baby!) is decent and the tapas selections sound great.   The problem is the last few times the service is just painful. Maybe you'll be luckier than I.   If you go get the shu mai shooters, these almost even worth the service problems.

With the explosion of coffee shops in CenPho these days (Fair trade, Royal, Copper Star, Hob Nobs, Lola at the Gold Spot, Sbuck$, and the soon to come Giant) its going to be hard for me to get over here routinely.  The coffee tastes similar to other places that I've just listed and the ambiance is just confusing. Is it an art gallery, a boutique, a coffee shop - I'd just prefer it picked one.  The best way that I experience this place is grab a coffee and dessert to go. The lack of seating just makes it tough for me to want to routinely come back and relax. The desserts (especially the cupcakes) are truly tasty, and you should go out an try them.  At the end of the day though, there are other options.

So you're hearing from your SO that they want a burger, and you just want a beer without the usual sports bar fare, but something genuinely tasty? Yeah, here's your spot.   If you've been lucky enough to go to England and eat in a Pub, you'll agree that this is the best reproduction you can get in town.   Fish and chips are still the best, don't be shy with the malt vinegar. Cole slaw is also the real deal.   Leave the weight watchers points counting at home though as you won't really enjoy the true experience.

So, I say to myself, "half price sushi for lunch? Oh yeah! You betcha!" well, even at half price, it's tough for me to get excited about thus place.   There's no real creativity (except for the disco balls during "happy birthday", seriously, uh yes) and it's fairly generic fare. The 2 stars are really for the fact the service was Johnny on the spot for edamame, miso and salad. The main fare though, just plain lacking. You're better off heading a mile or 2 down Ray over to Ra.

So, after being completely bored with the normal Chipotle, Baja Fresh, Pei wei, blah blah fare for lunch options during the week, and in desperate need of escape from the corporate world - i ventured into Spices after hearing about it from some co-workers.  Fantastic!! I've tried the Shawarma plate (both chicken and lamb/meat mix) as well as the gyro plate. In all cases I was pleasantly surprised. My personal choice is to get the hummus as the side (along with the wonderful cucumber/tomato salad) instead of fries. Its very tasty, even if it is a little rich on the tahini-side. The olive oil topping is a nice touch, especially considering how casual this place is, with its walk-up service.  The food has always been prepared fresh and quick and is a great choice if you're looking for the right mix of quality, taste and casual-ness.  Give it a shot and enjoy!

The one thing that I like about Maizie's is that I can always depend on the food being fresh and the produce is always crisp. Whether its the side of fruit with the breakfast special (this particular morning it was a pretzel-bread egg sandwich) or the greens with the salmon salad, the food just works.  The nice eclectic mix of sandwiches, breakfasts, salads and entrees typically has something for everyone. Also a nice side benefit is the range of wines and beers. Just like the food, there's also usually something for everyone, whether its PBR, Rogue Dead Guy Ale or Syrah from overseas, I'm confident you'll find something tasty.

Thanks to a recent post on the "Downtown Phoenix Journal" blog by Justin Lee regarding cheap eats (11/4), I decided to give this place a try as I pretty much agreed with his other choices.  As I've previously been told many times, 'don't you ever get tired of hummus?', and apparently the answer is 'no'. Even though I had leftover hummus from Switch from the night before, I was not to be deterred from trying a new source relatively close to home (especially since Pita Jungle doesn't seem to want to open up in my lifetime, although the rumor is any day now).   Sure enough at lunchtime, the place was not too crowded, but did do a solid and steady business. The girl behind the counter was extremely helpful and nice when asking for suggestions. Her's was the chicken shawarma, so off we went!  Of course, the crux of the story was to also get some hummus, which she mentioned didn't come with the sandwich, so I'd have to order separately. No prob, mate, its all good, so of course, let's get a small side.  My number gets called and the shawarma comes out more like a wrap, and the 'small' hummus was the size of a 12" dixie plate - fantastic!!  Net/net - the sandwich was solid and hummus was great.  The kicker is that its inside the grocery, so you get to do a little shopping for middle eastern coffee, turkish delights, cookies, etc., as a side benefit.

Hmmmm, interesting. Such a wide variety of reviews here on Yelp! Honestly, I hadn't looked at the reviews for a while when we finally decided to try out this place. I had been avoiding it, mainly b/c seeing $15 for entrees then $8 for sides was nothing that I wanted jump into right away.   Regardless, on our way to Actors Theater we figured that we'd do a nice dinner.   If you're looking for the standard run-of-the-mill class fare, stay away. In fact you're better off going to pizza hut across the street. If you want to push the edge of your comfort zone, you've found the right spot.   Case in point, I went with the evening's special, which was not pasta, but rather long green beans doing their best impression of pasta - creative? Risky? Wacky? Yes, yes, yes! Delicious- absolutely. Especially the prosciutto based sauce.  The wife had the Orrechiette con salsiccia - very flavorful and fun. (in fact, picking at it this am it was even tastier).   I also recommend the plate of fresh vegetables for an app. It seems to rotate, but last night's was solid - kale, butternut squash and fingerling potatoes all rocked.   The downside was my meal was a little saltier than I'd prefer and the red sauce for the side of meatballs was a tinge "bar-b-que"-esque. Not bad, just not expected. The meatballs themselves were solid.   Yes, the wine list is Italian focused, so buck up and take a risk away from your suburban merlot (see Paul giammatti in sideways in fact) and live a little! In fact, I see similarities with the list from Cibo and no one is complaining about their's.   Go, have fun, take a risk!

Everyone, in your best Joe Pesci (lethal weapon style) voice - "Ok, Ok, Ok". Yes, just like Joe gets excited, I'm totally excited about this place.   After dying to get there for like the last month, I finally made it. Uh oh, though, I look at the menu, and oh great more salads and panini's. I mean really?, is that what downtown needs. Hannys, postino, lisa g, local breeze, hob nob- great, sandwiches. :(  Then (insert angelic chorus - "ahhhhhhhh") the waitress walks through the specials. Lentil salad, salmon over greens, tofu pasta, garbanzo bean salad, et' voilà!  Low and behold, I went with the lentil salad. What do NBA fans say?- "Its Fantastic"! A mixture of lentils, carrots, zucch - all over greens. Mmm, yum. The wife went on to have a panini, and you know what, I'll be eating crow for sure. Pears, Brie, walnuts all on wheat bread, then grill - mmmmmmm.   Let's top it off with the chocolate mousse, shall we? Yes we shall!! Yes, ladies and gentlemen - another fine course.   The atmosphere is clean, but bright and casual. Give this place a shot- open your mind and have some fun!

Ok, even after sleeping on it, I can't really go higher than a 2. I like really,  really, really, really, really, want to like this place. The decor on the inside is fun, having a view of the kitchen is fun and hey, free sangria- what's not to like right?   Well, let's count the ways. First off, when it's 6:30 and you're writing on the chalkboard and I ask you "Are you open?" don't lie to me. Having to watch you setup, prep the food area, waiting  over 40 mins for tapas and watching the chef daudle in at 7:00 is not treating me with respect.   Next - no iced tea? (ok no big deal), no citrus scallops? ("we can do a great sangria shrimp", umm ok, sure), no beef stay? ("well, we can do chicken") - ok it's Friday night and you're not ready for these things? Weird.  I've already mentioned needing to wait over 40 mins for 2 of the 3 tapas (oh did I mention we were the only customers?), then the "great sangria shrimp" another 15 mins later?    To top it off, towards then end, because there's no ventilation from the kitchen to the dining area, our eyes started literally burning. Like seriously?  So at this point you're thinking why the 2 stars? Well, the Moroccan Sliders were FANTASTIC. no joke the best sliders that I think I've ever had. The chef has potential, but they've got to figure out the basics.

Its funny, every time I mention that I finally made it over to Moira and that I enjoyed it, I get the same reaction - "really?". For some reason this place has gotten a reputation of being overpriced for the portion sizes and just overall - run of the mill.  We had a different experience entirely, after waiting a couple of mins for a large party to break up, we were sat and then served quickly. The overall aura was one of fun, with a hint of edginess and modern appeal. So this started breaking away from the reputation as well.  The rolls push the envelope for uniqueness and the apps are just plain tasty. If you're in downtown, there's no reason to miss this place, and definitely no reason to travel 20 mins away to some of its competitors. The beer selection is Asian themed, with a chance for me to get a Tiger beer which brought back some memories of my travels across the Pacific.  All in all - fun times and fun food.

Seriously - $2 steak tacos?!!?? Awesome!   We've now been there twice in the last couple of weeks and each time have loved it. The Guac is by far my favorite part. The citrus/oranges twist is an amazing complement to the traditional pepper/onions fare. The other aspect that I loved was that it isn't grinded into a pulp. Turns out I really lie the chunky aspects of this guac. One twist that we did was ask for tortillas, vs. chips, and it turns out that they cook their own tortillas on site, so we got fresh tortillas - simply tasty.  I've tried all 4 tacos and definitely lean towards the steak (best) and pork (good second). I chased these with the watermelon-lime fresca the second time and the Periquitas ($5 red wine) the first time. Was pleasantly surprised each time.  Although I'm not a fan of frijoles (soupy beans), the beans here were as if you had some refried beans, with some whole beans, sprinkled with cotija cheese. They were very flavorful, almost a little smoky/earthy, which was a nice change from the regular old bland stuff you get at other places.

2 words- Naco torta. You won't be disappointed. Get the guac too. The citrus is a nice touch. If you're really lucky they'll have shrimp and grits as a special. Run, don't walk if they do. Throw in a fresca and call it a day.

Yay! Somone finally knows how to brew an iced mocha with skim milk that isn't completely bitter. Like, really, how hard can this be. Now don't get me wrong I do like Fair Trade, but the only mocha I can get there is whole milk. Yeah, I know what you're thinking and I don't like it. "who orders a mocha with skim milk, honestly?". Well I do, and it shouldn't be hard to get one. Lola comes through- "huzzah!!"  I actually got the Matador (adds cinnamon) and to my surprise- "loved it". Or as Paris Hilton has be tweeting these days "Huge!" yeah, I don't know, don't ask...  The next nice surprise was the frittata. After having just done a 6mi run, I was pretty hungry. We saw two choices and went for the Parmesan/asparagus - very yum as well.   The icing on the cake (no pun intended), is that we got to see our favorite baker - Daniele - and her delicious treats. Give the scones a chance, you'll be happy you did.

Me? I'm really more of a fan of 3rd Fridays over 1st fridays. First Friday's has turned more into a freak show rather than an Art Walk, call me old-fashioned, but I actually like art on artwalks.  Hence, why I was a little anxious about this place. When we walked by a couple of weeks ago, the place was *hoppin*. Paaaaaaaaarrrrrttttyyy central, yes indeed-y.  Well, last night was way more my speed. A nice tasty patio dinner with a unique selection of Asian goodies in a not-so-glam-jam atmosphere. (Granted, as we were leaving, they had a combo DJ-saoxophonist group playing tunes in the bar area which was tres-fun).   In our little jaunt we sampled the oriental-sausage crepes, cucumber salad, chicken dumplings and kimchee. yes, I said Kimchee. Honestly, I haven't had any since going to Saigon Pho years ago for good Vietnamese food. Seeing it as a side here, I just had to try it.  What was nice was all of the food was unique without being wacky.  We never got to the entrees, but all of the starters and salad items were great quality with fun platings, presentation and overall atmosphere. Oh, and a nice glass of Irony Pinot Noir to wash it all down was a great help.

Always solid. The new slider apps are phenomenal. Rack of lamb is pure money. Pair with a glass of the Bordeaux and you're enjoying life. Best risotto in town by far. Waitress is really helpful. Call for reservations to be safe.

Once again, its interesting to see the varied opinions from folks about this place, and quite frankly, I had my doubts before trying it out prior to checking out the "Capitol Steps" comedy singers at the Scottsdale Center for the performing arts, but we don't get to old town that often, and wanted something a little different. So it was either this or Iruna, so for no real reason, we choose here.  We got there a little early after meandering old town for christmas gift ideas. Our server was prompt and very helpful in recommending various tapas dishes - Gambas al Pil-Pil (shrimp), Txistorra (basque sausage), Cerdo con jamon (Pork tenderloin) and the Solomillo Moruno (awesome steak, perhaps the most tender that I've had, after Mastro's). All were very tasty.  The only dish we had which we ventured on our own was the Alubia soup. It was a cool night, and a warm soup was well needed - and this hit the spot - very much recommended - black sausage, red beans, flavorful broth.  The other nice aspect from our server was the wine recommendation. I ordered a glass of Tempranillo, which I was quite happy with. Our server actually suggested one of the other labels which was wine spectator rated, and I was resistant - so, he comes by with a sample taste just to prove his point. Sure enough, he was right - so my next glass was his suggestion. Yep, the cost was a few bucks more, but my experience was much better, and it was my choice - his volunteering to grab a sample was the right move.  With no more Lola tapas, I'll still be nostalgic, but will be very happy coming back here - tasty food and great service.

After a quick 3hr round of golf, an ice cold Raj IPA from four peaks, Sicilian pizza and BLT pizza hit the spot perfectly. The telltale sign for tasty pizza for me is crust and sauce.  This place gets really high marks for both, in fact the crust is just darn good and chewy.   Tempura green beans were a really nice surprise as well. Probably my second favorite place for appetizer/side dish veggies after The Grind.   Service was spot on, atmosphere is way more fun than the previous Treinte Cinque(granted I never got to this location when it was The Living Room).    Now you may think we're getting a tad saturated with pizza places (cibo, Bianco, brick, oreganos, Zpizza, mama Mia, aiellos's, parlor, et al.), As do I, but this place is top tier and stays in the rotation.

Family ordered banana pancakes as well as a scramble. Both were spot on, with the pancakes being the star. The iced coffee was pure money. Ordered a chocolate coconut oatmeal cookie to go, which was nice and fresh.   Good service, attentive staff.

Just plain tasty. Lots of great toppings choices. The "sunny" was actually really good. Nice cold pilsner to wash everything down as well. Good service to boot.
