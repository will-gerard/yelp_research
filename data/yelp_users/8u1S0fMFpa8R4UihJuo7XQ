High quality in both service and food. How do they not have 5 stars? Some people are just too picky... I'd hate to see how they act at Chili's.   Anyway,  came here for a work lunch today and could not have been more impressed. The size of their shrimp for the shrimp cocktail was more than adequate,  they were fresh, and the cocktail sauce was deeelicious. Had the Mediterranean salad which I also thoroughly enjoyed. They were very generous with the servings of the chicken on top- it was hot, moist,  and sliced thin enough to be enhance the salad but not too thin where it was skimpy. Loved the pickled red peppers and heirloom tomatoes as a twist, too. Feta was fresh and the dressing was great.    Dessert: coconut cream pie and creme brulee. Both were fantastic. I don't normally like coconut, and I had 2 helpings!   Service: great, great, great, and even had a nice chat with the new manager.   Scottsdale location is closer, but I'd definitely like a "next time"... my husband's birthday is coming up!

Postinos is a fabulous venue if you love wine and bruschetta.  I have been to the Gilbert location and now this one for lunch today. I much prefer the Gilbert locale for the square footage and parking alone. The Gilbert shop is at least double the size of Arcadia, and there is wayyy more parking. Food/service/everything else wise, though, and these 2 are tied for quality.  Lunch was great today. We tried the creme brulee and it was to die for. So yum!  Really, my only complaint is the parking here. I don't like that valet is the ONLY option, especially when I can see nearby spots right in front of the restaurant. Made no sense. There's an overflow lot they directed me to about a block north.  Got to walk off some lunch that way, on the bright side. I still will not be able to let someone valet my car when I could park it myself, walk 3 steps, and then be inside the restaurant.

The place is old but clearly has maintained an enduring spirit of excellence,  especially based on the history behind some of these reviews.   First time here. It's a cold day so I was going to order hot tea, only to be surprised with a complimentary pot brought out along with water! Yeah baby. My hubz liked the free chips too, but I saved my room for the good stuff :)  So then we ordered 2 cups of hot and sour soup which was fantastic. Really warms you from the inside, and it had a nice after-kick (without kicking your ass). Also got the fried wontons- they weren't served with cream cheese filling so as a personal preference I might skip next time. However,  if you like a little chicken or beef filling, these have your name on 'em!  We shared the chicken curry. Loved the layers of spices and flavors in there, and the sauce was generously portioned, too. Chicken, bell peppers, onions, peas and carrots came along as the accompaniment to the sauce and the whole combo together was a win.  Our waters were never empty. We're both camels so that's impressive.  All these reviews that whine how outdated or dirty this place is are completely off. The decor strikes me as more vintage than "dated", and I didn't see anything that indicated this place is not kept clean. Haters gonna hate.  But I loved it!  PS- also, a great value for your buck here. Prices were great

2nd review for what used to be one of our favorites... used to be. Came here today- We finished our basket of chips before the drinks came out. There were three tables in the restaurant so not sure what took so long, but we were well beyond thirsty. Husband ordered his carne asada burrito with guac and sour cream on the side, so naturally it came out with it on top.  I had the huevos rancheros and asked for a corn instead of a flour tortilla- you guessed it, I got the flour.  Our waitress took so long to check on us we just decided to deal with it and eat anyway since we were hungry. Halfway done with the food before we were asked how it all was. Just responded with a shrug.  Sat there for 10 minutes after we finished eating. Where is she? Where is our tab? Nowhere to be seen. Finally my husband got up and found her socializing behind the scenes. He asked her to bring the check.  Okay so get this.  Each diet Pepsi (which were flat) cost $2.50. No refills were offered. Carne burrito served enchilada style A LA CARTE came out to be around $14... Lol! What?! My huevos was around $10. The food was ok. The service was negligent and deplorable.   This experience cost $31.50... seems high for Rositas, especially given there were a few booths that looked pretty dilapidated and there was a hole in the wall in front of one.  1 star... for the food today, and fond memories in visits past. But we won't be back.

Great homestyle Mexican food. If you like heat, order the pedazos, which are actually considered an appetizer but the serving is so big it can easily be shared. It's this delicious pulled beef/chile combo stuffed inside a giant,  cheesy quesadilla. Heaven. Eat it with the mexicali relish and it's game over. Its the only thing I order. Love the bean dip and chips, too.   Service can be a little hectic,  but I've seen most of the waitstaff always just hustling and bustling all around so I think that's why, and I'm fair when taking that into account. Maybe add some staff to take the pressure off? Wait times suck during peak hours (Friday night, for example.)  It's certainly not gourmet but it hits *the* spot when you get that naughty-bad-for-you-good-for-the-soul-craving for Mexican food.

Love coming here! Great and cheap drinks, the bar and wait staff are always nice and helpful even when they're completely swamped. It's got a homey vibe. It's just a "comfortable" bar, that happens to also serve yummy and generously portioned food. You can tell it's an older bar by the dated and dark chairs and tables, but it works!

It's so easy to have a bad time shopping for cars. That wasn't the case for our visit here. Regular dealers love to bully you into making a decision nownownow and shroud the truth behind puffed up numbers and sales slang.   We were referred by a friend and found some inventory online we really liked so we stopped in yesterday. We were given the freedom of test driving the cars without the salesman riding along which I liked. We found *the* car and Kyle was so helpful with getting all of our paperwork going. I most enjoyed his clear, black and white breakdown of the fees to be absorbed into the end price. Nothing was ever unclear. Most importantly,  we never felt pressured once, which is such a perk for car shopping.    I was impressed by the level of professionalism and helpfulness without once coming off as overbearing. We got our car and will refer everyone here in the future!

2.5 stars. Basic room, seriously no frills. But the room was cheap and at least clean.   I dock points for the loud music you can hear from Fremont. What the hell is that about? Come on now, and I don't like that they don't tell you about it at check in. Our room was right next to the ice maker too, so we got to hear all the comings and goings of everyone on top of that... joy.  The casino was cold for us. Nothing hit between roulette,  black jack, or slots.  The location is decent so we had a good launch point for walking around though.  Underwhelmed but like I said- the room was cheap.

Really positive experiences here. Everyone is always friendly and helpful. Even on July 4th,  which must not be fun to work if you have to, all of the employees walked past us with a smile and a wave or to ask if we needed assistance. Tidy and organized... what's not to love?

Ok so we frequent the Chandler one at least once a week... we just love this place! The waitresses are always on point- it's really the Zipps with the most consistent service, by far. And the happy hour CANNOT be beat! $6 for 10 wings is a bargain!! And the zipparitas make my heart sing with joy. We love the fries and the onion rings, and loveee the option of changing it up with half and half orders! Yea baby.  An ode to Zipps: O, Zipps, thy food and service are great A good place for friends or a date Of your quality there is nothing to hate The best sports bar in all the state!

First off, I have been going to IAM for 15 years or so.   Secondly, I think medical care has declined in quality significantly, no matter where you go.  This office is a classic example.  Tell me, is there any decent PCP's out there??   In March I visited Nancy for a UTI.  She sent off a culture and gave me some antibiotics (second round. First round given by Urgent Care.)  I never heard back on the result of my urine culture, and my symptoms persisted.  I had tried calling Nancy and her "nurse" who miraculously never answers or returns phone calls.  I was informed they were BOTH out of town for a week!  What? How convenient is that?  Why would she not have mentioned this to me before sending out a test that would require contacting me relatively soon thereafter with the results??  Being that I was still having symptoms and needed my results, I was informed Too-Bad-So-Sad by the receptionist.  Actually in the most apathetic, monotone possible she said:  "I will leave her a message and hope she checks them while she is out of town."  Wow, now that is exemplary health care if ever I heard!  I of course never got my urine culture results and since my actual doctor's office was completely useless, I went to my gyno who cured me immediately.  Two months later I have a UTI again.  I called Nancy's office, and you guessed it- the nurse didn't answer. Shocker!  I called the "front office" (lol) and was advised she would, "leave her a message," again and call me back, k bye.  I said, "Um, hold on, don't you want to confirm my phone number?"  "No, we have it on file. I have 480-blabla.." and I cut her off and said that that is my old phone number.  Wow, no wonder I never heard back from anyone in the last 2 months.  NOBODY EVER CONFIRMED MY PHONE NUMBER.  I remember writing it down on the paperwork at my last visit.  Just another ball that was dropped, I guess.  Three hours later, I call back to see if she has any answers on that really helpful and proactive message that was left for the doctor.  "No."  Me: "Ok, well can you go back there and see if she is available to ask?"   Her response: "I can't because this is a call center. I do not work in that office."   OMG lol!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I started laughing.  I am talking to someone about my medical needs who sounds like a bratty high school drop-out and she is working in a CALL CENTER. Not even the doctor's office.   She transferred me back to the nurse's line, who, yet again, did not answer.  I am going to Urgent Care tonight and rue on this scam of a medical office.  I asked the Call-center-receptionist if she could forward on my dissatisfaction with the office and with the medical treatment I have received and she said she could transfer me to the nurse.  So, let me get this straight.  No one returns calls or checks messages (at least from my experience.)  No one is available to talk to at the actual office.  And no one is even available to lodge a complaint with or to request some degree of culpability for this office's deploring lack of concern for its' patients' well-being?    Peace out, I am sticking with my gyno and Urgent Care from now on.

We have come here twice for breakfast,  mainly because the lines later in the day get ridiculously long. Both times, breakfast was great. I had the breakfast tacos and more recently had the green eggs and ham scramble. Both entrées were generously portioned,  although my one complaint would be that the fruit cup I got to accompany the scramble was really small. Especially when you compare it to the generous side of potatoes my husband got with his scramble. Eh, it's a small thing, because in hindsight the food tastes great,  and the fruit itself was fresh.   Their coffee is really good, although I have one small complaint here, too. There's only one coffee pot that's left out to serve all the people there for breakfast,  so it runs out a lot and I usually get stuck with asking for more. Maybe we can put out 2 or 3 coffee pots? That might quicken up the speed of the coffee station as a whole, too.  I love the ambiance of the farm right outside and there's plenty of seating choices to choose from. It's very serve-yourself here, and that's ok, just don't come in expecting a fine dining experience. It's wholesome food, and I always leave feeling satisfied.

Firstly, the sushi here is ALWAYS yummy and fresh. Having frequented the resaurant multiple times, I'm always impressed with the food quality in correlation to the price. Sure, some specialty rolls are a little pricey but that is any sushi joint. The happy hour prices are unbelievable, both for the food and drinks (sake bombers!). The first few times here, the service was pretty shaky usually because of being understaffed. Recently, though, the service has been just as stellar as the sushi rolls. It is a bummer they don't have low sodium soy sauce, but that is only a small qualm.   Definitely worth a try, if you haven't yet!

Cheap drinks, very eclectic atmosphere. Between just chilling at a table or standing up and dancing to the live band, there's a slice of night life to suit whatever the need.  Don't enter with high expectations. Take it for what it is and have a good time :)

What's not to love? Their house margaritas are the best in town, and with happy hour their prices are even better. Their food is classic gourmet Mexican with a twist. I love their Sunday brunch!!  Their Juevos Rancheros was deeelicious (the Bloody Maria, too!) And the hot salsa they serve with their chips is my favorite. The service also gets 5 stars, whether it's their servers or bartenders. Expect a wait on Saturday nights, but that's pretty much with anywhere.

Great healthy option for eating out. We love to get the hummus sampler because we like them all! My favorite entrée is the spicy chicken pita, yummo.  We have always had good service and fresh, consistent food.  Gotta love the location for us inhabitants of Gilbert,  too.

Levi re keyed our new house when we moved in. He was very thorough from the beginning, even with giving a courtesy call when he was on his way. There were like 3 or 4 locks with different keys and he recommended making one key for all the doors to cut down on any confusion. He even noticed some of our locks were getting a little rusty from age so he oiled all of our locks as a courtesy to help extend the life of the locks. There is one weird lock I have on my back screen door that doesnt even lead from or through our sliding glass door.  He recommended just leaving it be instead of trying to upsell fixing it, which would really be kinda pointless anyway. The yelp deal was awesome and he was awesome and the whole thing was quick, fast, and pleasant.

My husband and I joke that there is a sign on our faces when we come in that says, "please ignore us." It's not just this location either,  the one in Tempe has provided forgetful/nonexistent service the past few times, too. That's frustrating because a soft drink costs nearly $3 here, so something as simple as refills would make me feel like I'm getting more value for a $3 iced down soda.... The bottomless fries are advertised and posted everywhere,  which, again,  makes you feel like you're recovering some value when you pay $12 for a burger. But, alas- the service has been either irritable/snarky when fries and refills are  requested or it's just nonexistent altogether.  Tell me why I'm spending $30 here for 2 people again? In n Out is across the street...  1 star because the burgers and fries really are delicious. No other stars because that testifies to how disappointed I am in what used to be a good, consistent franchise.  Unfortunately our experiences have been such a let down as far as the service is concerned, we'd rather save our $30 and avoid the crying children and just stay away altogether. Maybe we'll sit at the bar if we ever go back... at least someone has to acknowledge you there (hopefully? ).

You have to come here if you want the job done right! My wedding dress alterations cost $160 (what ISN'T expensive in the wedding world?) But the cost reflects the high level of quality that is provided here. She took in the bust, added a bustle,  and fixed the beading on the dress for visit #1. Visit #2 actually was my idea because I wasn't 100% happy with the back of the dress; she did exactly what I asked and had it ready to pick up the next day and didnt even charge me anything extra...   Then. I had to come back, unfortunately, again. The cleaners I used to press the dress actually ruined the bustle she had created,  so visit #3 included her fixing the bustle THE WEEK OF my wedding for no additional cost (again!) and she got it done the next day, which was so awesome because if you've ever gotten married, you know what Wedding Week stress is like and she helped decrease it so much.   I imagine her cash/check policy is to help keep down her overhead because she owns the shop herself and runs it with only a small staff (I am pretty sure I met them all between all my visits, and there's only around 3 people or so.)   She is a life saver and runs a business built on quality, which is so important in these times of corporations-cutting-corners. 5 stars.

If I could do 0 stars I would. Where do I start? It's annoying to field invasive, "personal" questions when I come in for a quick bank transaction. "Where do you work?" Is the most common question I've been asked when I have had to step inside. Since the same question happens every time, I know their effort at making this a "personal" banking experience is fake and forced,  which is even more annoying.   I cashed a sizable check, well tried, a few months back, and the sum of money was not large enough where I thought it warranted a return trip. They said they had to get the funds and they'd hold the check and I was to come back 2 days later. Ok? So I returned and the teller looked at my account like none of this was obvious,  my visit was a complete surprise, and he processed the transaction like it was a WITHDRAWAL not cashing a check. Wtf? Also, they had to give me about half the money in 20's because they ran out of 100's. How does a bank run out of 100's? I was especially annoyed because this was after I gave them a two day headstart so I could even get the money in the first place. Also, I found the teller asking questions about how/where my check came from to be too prying and quite frankly, give me my damn money and stop asking questions about things that aren't your business.   A month ago I went in to close my account. The manager of course came out to play the good guy, and talk me out of it. When he asked me why I was leaving, I tried to be polite and cite my recent marriage as the reason,  but of course being Midworst Bank,  they have to keep plowing away with questions. So, I finally, and bluntly,  told him exactly why I was leaving,  describing everything I mentioned above, and their severe lack of mobile banking.  He had the gall to make a joke out of my being upset with getting $700 in twenties. Nice. I was told they would close my account and that was that.   NOT. The never ending banking experience continues! I received a statement for my account which I thought closed! So I called and no one was able to help me, because they are so mismanaged and disorganized, nothing is achievable in one transaction or even one phone call. The girl asked me which manager helped me, "soandso or soandso?" I don't know/remember,  this was a month ago, do you people not keep records? We finally figured out the manager who helped me but of course he was out on lunch so I had to wait an hour and a half before he called me back.   You know what he said? This, being the manager of the bank I left after I told him how awful their banking structure is. He said HE FORGOT to close my account. After he made another joke that was inappropriate and ill-timed. How do you forget to do your job? Too many hour and a half lunches, I guess. And the most lol-worthy moment: "I see you have a credit of $0.78. Normally when we close accounts we ask you to pick up the funds but since this is a special exception, I can mail you a check for it instead."  I'm sure he forgot to mail the check, as I have yet to receive anything, but at least I avoided wasting anymore time in that circus.

Eh. Lackluster and overpriced food.  Their wings are pretty wimpy. The service is either just ok or really bad. Their mixed drinks on special feature cheap well liquor. I'm not asking for Grey Goose, but the vodka tasted like it came from a plastic bottle. I'm a big house salad eater, and theirs are only served with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes on top. How bout some onions and croutons?!  But seriously,  the food isn't what it used to be at other locations ~10 years ago or so. We don't come in anymore because it's always an expensive way to just leave disappointed.

YUM! You guys have to come here if you haven't already. LOVE their pizza, LOVE their (meaty and saucy) wings, and they are generous with all portions of the food, including ranch. The counter girls are always friendly, and the food is fast and fresh. Barro's is the besto's.

Yesterday was my first visit but it won't be my last.  You MUST make an appointment but it's well worth the advance scheduling. I made my appointment on Tuesday and Friday was the next available. Plan ahead!  I was really impressed with how timely they all were. Ruth is a great multitasker, she was helping soak my fingers in acetone to get my old gels off while answering the phone and scheduling appointments. My appointment was at 4 and I was seated within just a few minutes.  Mary was my nail tech. I really enjoyed how gentle she was! Especially with the cuticle trimming and buffing- I have been to so many salons where these treatments HURT and I have had my nail beds bleed a time or two in the past. Mary was so meticulate and not once did I flinch in pain. Her attention to detail was impressive, she ensured every detail was done to her satisfaction, and if it wasn't she had no problem redoing it. She was generous with the number of gel coats she applied and told me this one would last way longer than the manicure I walked in with (from another place.)  I'm a believa' in Jeniza!

Got a pedi with a girlfriend yesterday. I should have just set a $20 bill on fire and painted my own toenails.  So we walk in at 4 pm and I guess it's food/social hour in the back break room which is visible to the front. My friend gets her pedi started right away and I'm sitting there wondering about mine? People still eating and chatting. Oh and the water was cold for both of us so we asked them to warm it up.  Five minutes later some girl walks up, finishing a bite of something. Nonchalantly gets started on my feet after muttering a hi. Then... An uninterrupted stream of Vietnamese chatter began between our two techs and they pretty much ignored us after that.   My friend started wincing in pain during the cuticle/dead skin removal. The gal paid no attention. Meanwhile my girl had already caught up to this part of the pedi, despite the fact that she started 5 to 10 minutes late. I could see things on my toenails she was just not doing or skipping completely.   I'll say this: the massage was long at least. She didn't really "massage" it was a pretty weak gripping, but it was long. Longest part of the shortest pedicure ever lol.  So then she paints my toes. One coat. No top coat. And then I'm done. We finished before my friend and her girl. My tech immediately got up, picked up her cell and called someone to chat with out front. I guess the nonstop Vietnamese in front of us just wasn't long enough.  At one point I noticed an employee walk up with a floss stick in her mouth. She stood fairly near us as she was using it. Gross. Even my friend made a comment to me like "Is this really happening?"  It did happen. The Worst Pedicure Ever. The pedicure was also the shortest I have received. Even when we were trying to check out, the entire salon suddenly became bereft of any employee who was able to collect our money. We waited about 5 minutes until someone was forced to emerge from the breakroom.  This establishment has employees who lack attention to detail and the ability to connect with customers. I felt completely ignored. In fact, like an inconvenience to the dining and whining that we had no doubt interrupted.   No matter, we made our dissatisfaction clear with our tips and now with this review. Beware!

Okay, first trip here but have been driving past and couldn't wait to try it- we were finally able to since we came in Sunday, as we have tried going there Mondays and they are closed (inconvenient). My house marg was decent, the chips ok, salsa was fair but the hotter of the two tasted like canned tomato paste with some spice added haphazardly.   Unfortunately, the service was awful. Side plates and silverware and napkins are nice to have... Refilling iced teas, the waitress asked if my fellow patrons would like more ice, since it had been so long all the ice melted. The obvious answer is yes please more ice, this being *iced tea and all. The pollo fundido was too smothered and too soggy, the rice and beans were decent. My boyfriend's chimi didn't have much meat There was a mix up with our check which topped off the Poor Service Cherry and the waitress didn't seem too concerned or bothered by overcharging us by $20 when we brought it to her attention.  Also, for being brand new I was surprised to find the bathroom smelled like sewage, come on, that's gross.  With all the mexican food restaurants in the area, La Fonda falls short.

It has taken at least 10 minutes for 2 breakfast sandwiches and there is not a lot of patrons in here.  The coffee tastes like carpet.  The water tastes like rust, and carpet.  Still waiting on the food. I doubt a miraculous taste bud experience will change my mind about this subpar dining experience.   Just kidding, the Tabasco packets are literally red water. Where is the Cholula?  Should have gone to McDonald's.  Edit: we are now suffering the consequences of heartburn from our greasy sandwiches. Ugh.

Revolving sushi. You sit down,  pick your plates, and pay for your plates afterwards, right? My experience here was so comically frustrating and confusing, all we could do was laugh at the end because it WAS SO BAD. What a shame, because I had brought my parents to try out their first revolving sushi experience. For lunch on a weekday, we were greeted by the hostess who advised in order to participate in the sushi conveyor belt, we HAD to purchase an All - You - Can - Eat deal for $15 PLUS drink. Otherwise we would have to order sushi off the menu.  Well how disappointing to come in to eat off the conveyor belt, only to be told you're not allowed to without committing to at least ~$20/person. That defeats the whole point of revolving sushi, if you ask me! It's designed to be convenient and cheap. So we sat there, letting the food roll past us, taunting us, until we ordered our sushi the old fashioned way.   The waitress was in serious want of better training. After providing us with a paper menu listing sushi rolls and prices, we each ordered a roll. I also.got miso soup which tasted bland and was lukewarm. Oh, we also got edemame, which they first forgot and then grabbed hastily from the revolving belt and served to us soggy (why are we not allowed to grab off the belt again?) The rolls weren't great but weren't bad. I think they also came from the belt because they were served in smaller, clustered portions. (Why..?!)  When we got our check, the rolls were priced higher than the waitress advised us according to the menu she brought out. We spoke with the manager who said she brought us the to - go menu, so sorry but tough sh*t, we were stuck with the tab even though the fault was not with us. Even after we expressed our disappointment with the food, no concession or apology was offered.   For what was supposed to be an easy, cheap lunch, it turned out to be disaster. Never again. There are too many other good and competent sushi joints in the valley to waste time here.

Locally owned coffee/breakfast joint. Love the iced toddy. The coffee is cold brewed and it puts Starby's to shame. *hint- add sugar free vanilla and it's even better* Since we moved away from Gilbert, we don't frequent here as often unless we visit family in the area. I definitely miss their rotating weekend breakfast specials. They manage to come up with something new and 'licious every time.  I read a few reviews that griped about the prices? I think the prices are reasonable and reflect the quality and freshness that I expect when dining out. It's no worse than Village Inn and the food is way better. Also, bearing in mind this is a small local business I don't mind paying these prices to keep these honest folks around and in business.   Keep it up!

HIGHLY recommend this place if you enjoy some New Mexican cuisine in your life.   The chips and salsa are a great way to start it off- my only complaint (if there is one) is that the salsa bowls aren't big enough! That's ok, it helps me save room for the entree, which is worth saving room for!  I have had the blue corn enchiladas,  which are great, and this last time I had the adovada burrito Christmas style - wow! So flavorful and so tender. Food like that keeps you coming back,  that's for sure! Oh and the black beans were great too... Unfortunately I didn't have enough room for the rice but my fiance had no trouble finishing it up! I saw their orders of nachos (which you can also get with adovada) and they're definitely big enough to share.   I know they're also a tequila bar but I haven't tried any- yet. With food like that though, I know I'll be back and maybe I'll give it a whirl next time!

My friend's sandwich took 15 minutes to be brought out. By that time I had nearly finished my salad. It wasn't even busy that day, there was hardly a line. When the sandwich did come, it didn't have any kind of dressing or condiments. Who wants a dry sandwich? I successfully garnered a side of mayonnaise to remedy the situation. The manager was informed about the long wait and dry sandwich and nothing was done about it. Salad was good,  but the inattention to detail and customer service were disappointing. I'll probably go back but not for a while. The salad was good but they need to get their sh*t together.

Eh. That's really it... The chips were strips of chips and they were too thin so it was kinda like eating crumbs because they kept breaking. The salsa was eh. My husband ordered a carne asada plate and about 1/8th of the plate was meat, the rest was beans and rice. The meat was dry. For paying an extra few bucks to get some meat on my salad, I should have received something that looked like meat? Instead there were crumbs of ground what-can-only-asssumed-to-be-meat interspersed through my bowl of lettuce (because the presence of other salad-like ingredients was sorely lacking.) I guess that's my mistake for ordering a salad at a Mexican joint.  The server was pretty awesome though,  she was really on top of it. The ambiance of the restaurant is very cozy and quaint,  it looks like one of the walls opens up to the patio which might be cool when it's not 120° outside.   The prices didn't match the food quality.  Maybe it was a bad day or a growing pain? Eh. Maybe we'll come back. Maybe.

We are moving our stuff into a POD for 6 months while our new house is being built. This entails only needing movers to move the heavy stuff down our stairs and into our POD parked in the driveway. Most moving companies were quoting me some ridiculous numbers for something that would only take 1 to 2 hours, tops.   When I called here, the quote was adjusted lower because I wouldn't be needing movers for long and I wouldn't be needing them to drive my stuff anywhere. The price was very fair. The day before our move, the owner called to confirm the reservation and give me a heads up on some details...then! Gave me the opportunity to ask if I had any questions. This impressed me again!  The movers were early! And fast! And gentle with our stuff. We will definitely be using Smooth Transition again come September. Great job! The owner cares and that really shows.

The beer selection and convenient location are why we have come in the past, but I don't know if those are enough to encourage another return. The service started out great when they first opened this location last year- everyone  seemed genuinely happy to have you in and offered a sample or two of the beers before you decided. We even had some regular familiar faces that remembered us too, and that's always nice. Unfortunately,  the last few times we have always had a different server and they've all had just the hint of an attitude. Save it for Scottsdale,  this is a small beer bar in Gilbert, give me a break. The last few times I would qualify the service as mediocre at best, as well. Really slow on asking for refills or checking on you at all for that matter.   The pretzel here is really good though,  I like both the mustard and cheese they serve it with for dipping. Its a little pricey, though, and there is an upcharge for the cheese.  I have had their flat bread before and it's nothing special to write home about.   Oh, last time I was here I ordered a margar"ipa" which was explained as a margarita topped with an IPA. It seemed intriguing, but unfortunately turned out to be very poorly executed. It was served in a glass the size of a whiskey tumbler, the tequila was cheap, and it cost a staggering $12! I just laughed when I got the bill because it was so outrageous.  Originally I wanted to send back the drink when I first got it (not even realizing how much it cost) but the server disappeared for about a half hour afterwards so I just dealt with it.  I started this review rating 3 stars, but as I have been writing I have concluded there is nothing here that warrants a rating higher than 2 anymore. It's a shame, because it used to be so much better.  Edit: after scanning other reviews rating WOB similarly,  I actually found one that included a response from the owner in reference to someone's complaint about having a basic/limited menu. The owner offered an apology and a promise that a new one is on its way. I found this odd as a staggering number of the reviews rate low because of the poor/inattentive service,  yet no response or concession has been made by the owner toward this aspect (from what I have seen.) It just seems really weird to clearly hold an online presence, yet not actually respond to what seems to be a [more serious] recurring problem with the business. Anyway....

We have come here twice now and will definitely be going back again.  The first time, my husband and I ordered two cups of chowda' (deeelicious, the best in town) and The King to share (and still couldn't finish it all!)   Today we returned with our families to celebrate Mother's Day and were amazed by their superb quality of both food and service yet again.  The five of us shared the shrimp cocktail and lobster mac 'n cheese to start.  Oh my, those shrimps were huge! And the LM&C was generously portioned with healthy chunks of lobster throughout. We really couldn't stay out of it, it was so good.    We tried the Bloody Mary bar and were not disappointed there either.  The "customization" options available were impressive. You have a choice between what kind of Mary mix to add (spicy or not), and then there was two different kinds of olives to choose from, sweet pickles, asparagus,  and more!  Lots of sauces were available to add in as well, not to mention the Mary started off with having a slab of bacon inside the cup. Yum. Honestly, it could have been a meal in itself.  Got the fish and chips and found the fish to be perfectly crisp on the outside,  not overbreaded, very airy and light breading actually,  and flavorful,  tender fish inside.  The tartar sauce was great, and the fries were served as a combination of shoestring and sweet potato fries. Loved the inventiveness of changing up a regular old side of fries. The slaw was fresh and included nuts and fruit.  My mother-in-law raved about her shrimp boil and my mom gt a Caesar salad and clam "chowda". The waiter tonight was great,  very accommodating even when my.mom changed her entree choice about 10 minutes before the food came out. Also, since it was Mother's day,  she and my mother in law were served complimentary mimosas. What a nice touch!   The prices are a little high, yes, but I have no problem when their quality is as high and consistent as it is.  Expect to make a reservation on their busier nights (Friday/Saturday) become it gets packed and we found out he hard way last Friday.  That's ok, this joint is worth everything and more, and I have a feeling Gilbert has a new fish restaurant (finally) that's here to stay.

No idea why this place is rated so high. I have been here twice now.  Visit #1- happy hour with a coworker at about 3 on a Friday. The bar was pretty open. We sat down and it took about 10 minutes for one of the 4 pretentious bartenders to ask for our drink order.  They all had a bad case of Grumpy Cat frowns. I usually like to be greeted by a smile, especially when trying out a new spot for the first time. They watched us as we sat there waiting for service and not one said anything until 10 minutes in. Minus points for that, because service is huge for me. The sangria was ok. Pretzel and cheese were just okay but they forgot to light the candle under the cheese to keep it warm. Our party grew and we migrated to a table and our server was much better. I ordered a beer next which was overpriced. Happy hour beer pours looked teeny weeny.  Visit #2- work lunch. Server was slow and refused to go over the specials until our whole party was seated, because as he admitted, he only wanted to do it once. I ordered an iced tea which melted the ice and was never refilled. I ordered the italian chopped salad which featured too much couscous and the dressing was too little. It was too chopped, so it was less crunchy than I would prefer.  There is not a lot about this places that jumps out and wows me. The food is just ok but costs too much for what it is. Decor is nice and modern but the modern vibe seems forced and false when it comes to its execution in their food. Most of my experiences with the service have fallen under my expectations at this price point (except for the fabbo waiter we switched to on visit #1).  Both times parking sucked!

Stopped in with the fam to try out the new joint. This turned out to be an excellent decision!  The iced toddy was delicious. you have the option of drinking it out of a cold mason jar for the same price as a small, and that made it retain it's coldness. I got the last green chile pork empanada. It was awesome!  Flaky crust and the meat inside was flavorful and moist even though it was under a heat lamp. I tried my mother-in-law's blueberry muffin (read: ate half of) and that was really good too. She loved her latte.  They allow you to dress up your coffee with organic sugar cane syrup at the creamer station. At first I was bummed they didn't offer flavors (I love vanilla iced toddies) but the coffee is so good you don't need to distract yourself from that authenticity with artificial flavoring. A dash of sugar cane syrup gave me the sweetness I craved just fine.  Also- I LOVED the decor. My mil said it felt like Portland. I have to agree. There is a wall behind the barista counter that looks like it popped out of Pinterest. So cute.  We met the owner and you can tell he is proud of his establishment and aims to uphold a high standard of goods and service.   See ya next week, Peixoto!
