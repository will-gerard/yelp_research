Absolutely LOVE this restaurant. The lasagne is incredible. I've been 5 or 6 times and can't seem to order anything else on the menu. It's quiet, romantic and the perfect place to go if you want authentic Italian food. It's very reasonably priced and never too busy that you have a long wait, although it's a good idea to make a reservation.

I have been going to Pima Dental for at least 5 years. Dr. Schwartz is incredibly talented, a perfectionist, and has a great personality. His hygienist Wendy is very thorough and gentle. The receptionist Ellen is very friendly and always welcoming when you walk into the office. The new location is beautiful and very modern. The pricing is very reasonable. There are many dentists that try to take advantage of people. Dr. Schwartz is incredibly honest. I have recommended friends, clients and coworkers and will continue to in the future.

Very unhappy with my alterations here. Almost everytime I've had pants shortened one leg was shorter/longer than the other. My dresses have had one side hanging on the floor and the other side perfect. I've had to go back and have things fixed many times. The last time, 3 different pairs of pants were completely uneven and Jose said he would fix them for me. I picked them up, tried them on at home and absolutely nothing was fixed. Either he didn't want to be bothered again or thought maybe he had done it. He seems like a sweet man but he can't sew a straight line. I've been going to Nadya at Frank Llyod Wright and Thompson Peak and she is AMAZING!! She fixed everything for me and it's all perfect!

This is the absolute worst place I've ever tried to do business with. Not only did it take 6 months for my furniture to arrive at the store, but it came in damaged. I picked out another set but 1 nightstand had to be ordered. I waited another few months and it still had not arrived. The owner simply could not give me an answer. I spent double the price at Restoration Hardware but my furniture arrived within a week. I have no idea how this store is still in business.
