Great selection of cigars. A lot better priced then back home in Milwaukee (stupid Tobacco tax). They even allow u to bring in your own drinks in, most place I've known frown on this, so when I heard that I was excited. Cigar King will match their website price and will give u great deal and great recommendations! Joe is the guy to talk to. He's only 20 but the kid knows his stuff, love to talk but is very informative and has great customer service. Will go above and beyond to help you.   This place also has a killer selection of watches and high end shaving cream. I was  hooked when I saw the shaving cream with old school brushes. I got a synthetic one for $20 with the holder. And I will never go back to shaving cream in a can. The stuff they had 2 8oz jars for $30. Art of Shaving, alone coat about $30. U might say compared to Edge or Gillette that super expensive but the blade cuts right through and doesn't get the cream stuck in the razor. Super clean smooth shave. I'm really starting to enjoy shaving a lot more.  If you just want to chill and smoke a cigar their lounge is a clean exposed garage with wild game on the walls, so if ur a member of PITA this place is not for you :), and at least 8-40" tvs for all the sport games. Over 10 oversized lounge chairs. This is the place to check out. They even have an old school wet bar like section where u could play cards if you wanted.  Def worth the trip! I can't wait to watch football there!

Good food, Great happy hour pints are all $3. The Nachos are super good and tons of beef. Wasn't aware it was a $4.50 up charge for beef tho. Very disappointing. I don't think its worth the price ($13.50) for an appetizer, but they def do give you a lot of beef. It taste amazing too. The Beer Wrap Turkey Sandwich is phenomenal. About 12 bucks but worth it includes bacon. My favorite beer is the Kilt Lifter, great aroma and hoppy taste. They brew all there own beers and only serve them. So don't expect to get a Miller Lite there.  The Scottsdale location is a nice chill place to relax at. I believe they even have a reverse happy hour that goes til 1 am.   Great place I will be back!!

First off coming from the midwest and born and raise in WI Dairy Cheese and Beer are king here. So I though for chain restaurant Culvers did a really good job an making a burger. That was until I had the BEST BURGER of my life. I was hungry i decided to get the the pound burger, I devour it. It was so good I order another one. I'm not sure if it was there seasoning or the fact I was in a casino and winning so everything taste better but It was so good I got a 1.5 lbs (hey when it's good, it's good). The staff was very friendly considering it was about 2am and i wasn't leaving till our ride was done gambling lol. Great Burger, Glad they will be in my new city of Phoenix, AZ. Cant wait to indulge in That Double Burger again.

Most Starbuck are pretty much the same. All have the same menu for the most part. The difference between them rely on the location on the way the seating is set up.  Pros: Big parking lot, good use of space available without feeling crammed, 3 lounge chairs with counter for drinks. Unlimited use of wifi, right off the 101, outside seating  Cons: Expensive lunch ( if you plan on grabbing food, do it before), only two decent size table for workspace, Hard to see the location off Tatum ( this is probably more cuz of city/ complex rules with marking the building with a sign). The parking is hard to find. I got lucky finding the only spot right up front.   Overall: All Starbucks are pretty much the same, this location is conveniently off the freeway, however lack of multi use tables for laptop work is a slight bummer. So I give it a four stars. They did however have great customer service. They did a pour-over for my favorite blend Blonde Roast.

I was in search of a breakfast burrito, yelp suggested this place.  Pros; spacious dinning area, high ceilings, waitress attentive, good coffee, small business operated, good ambience to start your day.  Cons: menu a little over priced for what you get. The breakfast entrees were about 9-10 bucks   But  the breakfast burrito was 5.99 and it was so good I ordered a second one.  This place had a true "cheers" like feel to it, everybody from the waitress to host to cook greets you. The customers are very friendly to talk to.   I will be back again!

I took my cousin for food at this place. To be honest is was subpar. We both got a burger ( i got a double, which was under a 1/4 lb), fries and a shake. The total was $18 little pricey for a fast food restaurant. I personally thought the burger fast like Burger King. Def nothing to write home about. The service was very nice. They were very helpful. The honey mustard dipping sauce taste like sweet yogurt with salt lol (not tasty, even to the nickelodeon teenager). The inside was very cool and old fashion layout. Just something I would expect a old fashion burger joint to be setup like. I enjoyed the ambience feel. Just can't recommend it for flavor-value ratio. If you just want a quick shake worth a stop. Could use a drive thru at this location.

I went to see 22 Jump Street on a Thursday night. It was about 1/3 full.  The thing about this theater is you can't get popcorn, soda or any food unless you order it from waitstaff that comes to your seat. The food is pretty similar to what it would be in a moderated price restaurant. They have $25 menu for two if your on a date, a lot less inexpensive then doing the two separately. Also Groupon has a killer deal 45% off for movies valid til August 15th. Basically makes your ticket $5. The seat selection comes down to office leather chairs and lounge chairs that don't recline with a classroom (can't coin the name Irina H. takes credit for that) desk come over the top. Like airplane seats in the 90s. Def make sure you take those. The two downfalls I will say is with all the waitstaff they have at least 15 ppl per screen for a non busy night, it took over 10 mins for someone to come by and take my order, while the light was on. I had to flag someone down to get their attention. As well as they almost forgot my soda (took another 15 mins; when they brought the popcorn in 3 mins). Not trying be mean, I would just prefer to get my food instead. With the great Groupon deal and the proximity of the theater to where I live. I will be back.
