I had a very good experience with Alicia, owner of Bravo Salon. I went into the salon for a Brazilian Keratin treatment. Alicia did a great job and was very attentive to feedback that I provided her on my super curly areas. She took the time to explain things and apply the treatment herself. I would go back to her for this again. My hair is nice and straight (the Chia Pet has been tamed) and I am thrilled. Thank you Alicia!

Hello all. After a hiatus where I tried several Keratin treatments, I came back to Alicia for the Brazilian Blowout. I emailed a request Thursday evening (have been traveling) and needed to get in asap. The Chia Pet had returned!  She responded to my email within the hour and opened the salon at 8am on Saturday to accomodate my schedule, which I thoroughly appreciated. She did a great job again on my hair and from now on will be doing all of my straightening. My hair is very curly and difficult and she even had her assistant (who was very good) assist with the blowout process so that they could both be working. I couldn't be happier with it. I was in and out in no time and had a great experience.

For the third time, I have had an excellent experience with Alicia and Bravo Salon. Once again, she opened the salon early (7am) to accomodate my schedule and to allow ample time to provide the attentiron that a Brazilian Blowout requires on long hair. The Chia Pet has been tamed again. I will always go to Alicia for this treatment. Her skill, professionalism and attention to detail always makes the difference.  UPDATE: 7/29/13. I just brought our daughter to Alicia for her first short cut. She is now rocking the Coco Chanel and looks adorable. Easy and fun looking! Plus, I now added my nails to the list of services at Bravo. Rebecca put shellac on and I love it. The family feel in this salon can't be beat!

La Torretta is our family favorite for Italian food. Darius, the owner, does a terrific job of remembering everyone's favorites or customizing to your desires that day. Our kids love the gnocchi bolognese and we love all of the fish entrees. The smoked chicken pasta is fabulous and I have even taken it to parties to rave reviews. Everything is fresh and fabulous. If you like OssoBucco, this is the best in town! Laurie and Rodney and the Boys

I have been going to Par Exsalonce in DC Ranch for more than 5 years. I have always had the best treatment whether it is for me or my Mom visiting or others that I have referred. Donna, the owner, is a hands on operator, and knows her clients names and their preferred stylists. Let me start with the front desk- Suzi and Jamie (coincidentally Mother and daughter) are friendly, knowledgeable and have never messed up an appt. for me. That should be the norm but unfortunately it is not. They great you in a friendly fashion and appts are taken on time. On the one occasion where my stylist was ill, they phoned me before I arrived which was very helpful. Finally, my stylist. I am very picky about my hair and I will not allow anyone other than Carol Hehman take care of it. She gets it right every time and is pleasant to all of her clients. She is simply awesome. I have referred numerous people to her and they echo my views. And then for my more blissful moments, I go to Cynthia for her facials. DIVINE! She does the best in the value from my view and I have tried many places. You leave hydrated and relaxed. Plus she does that pesky waxing without ripping you to shreds. A huge plus in my book. Love this place and it is reasonably priced. I am trying to get Donna to do a Frequent Client Card (they do run monthly specials) for those of us who are here all year, every month. Would love facial credits from my hair stuff that must be done.

Jade Palace in North Scottsdale is our favorite Chinese food in town. We eat there weekly and love the Chilean Sea Bass; the Shrimp Stuffed  Eggplant and the Yang Chow Fried Rice. Our boys, 21 and 12 ask to go to "Devlan's" all of the time as the friendly owner makes us all feel family. His Chinese New Year meal is spectacular and requires reservations. This food is fast, fresh and they pour a great drink! Laurie and Rodney and the Boys

Last evening we celebrated our dearest friend's 40th Birthday at Jade Palace. We asked for a special menu (designed by Devlin) which would include off the menu specialty foods and wine. It was SPECTACULAR. We started with soft shell crab and exquisite fish rolls made w/sole and stuffed w/ham and aspargus. Next we continued on to lobster in ginger scallion sauce (DIVINE) and 5 spice crispy chicken. We then had black pepper scallops and a melt in the mouth filet dish. Each course was complimented by a lovely wine choice. Dessert (her favorite part) was a beautiful chocolate sundae since our friend loves chocolate. All in all, it was a beautiful evening with fresh, beautifully prepared foods.

Time for an update. On a seemingly quiet Monday evening, we were in the mood for good chinese food. On the way to Jade Palace last evening, I said to my hubby and son," I am SO in the mood for shellfish. I hope they have it on the menu tonight." To our delight and surprise, there was a softshell crab appetizer (delicious cooked with jalapenos) and a full lobster prepared in ginger and scallion sauce. Hubby and I split the divine lobster and it was reasonably priced- $36 for 1 3/4 pounds. Our son ordered the Yang Chow Fried rice (a family favorite) and everyone was happy. Manager Hugh (cousin of the owner) always makes everyone welcome and happy.

Sapporo has been a family favorite for years. We had not been in for maybe 6 months or so. It was a really a great experience last night. We were not aware that there are new owners now. Chef Steve Byrne, Director of Culinary Operations for the whole parent company, was attentive to the entire dining room- checking on food prep; diner's experiences and quality. It has definitely paid off.  We started with the new menu item- pork belly- which literally melted in our mouths. Our son, 13 and his best friend loved it too. Then we ordered our family favorite- teppanaki. Hubby had the calamari steak (DIVINE); I had a NY strip and the kids had steak as well. The meal started impressively with the salad made at the table. They have significantly upgraded the salad adding fresh beets and a fresh ginger dressing instead of the pre-made stuff they had formerly. The teppanaki chef did a great job, entertaining everyone and cooking the food perfectly. The only suggestion I have is that I asked for medium rare and I was closer to medium but it was tasty.   BTW, Happy Hour pricing is the way to go. Big discounts on drinks and smaller portioned (but still more than one can eat) teppanaki meals that are affordable and will bring us in more often. Check it out before 7:00 pm  All in all a great experience and we are going back for hubby's birthday on Christmas Eve!

Hubby and I stopped in at Fez quite by accident last Thursday. Have been hearing about it for months but were in the area and happened upon it. I must say we enjoyed the whole experience. First we must start with the gspot special drink. I am normally a wine drinker, not swayed by sweet foo foo drinks. This one was on special ($3) and caught our eye due to the "made from fresh pink grapefruit" description. DIVINE. We both enjoyed it. Then we moved on to split the pasta special with shrimp and veggies and white wine sauce. Sounds like every other pasta dish in town, but the flavors were exceptional. We were both mopping up the sauce. The wait staff was adorable and friendly and it made for a lovely experience. Will definitely go back soon!

We bought a huge tree for the second year in a row. Last year it was fine. This year it has died prior to Christmas. We are having a big party on Christmas and my tree looks horrible and we are very upset. I called twice but only got an answering machine. We watered appropriately to no avail. It is dropping pines and dead. What a bummer.

I visited Dr. Steve yesterday after a couple of months of mild pain, but then experiencing great pain the last two weeks in my lower back. I also have tight shoulders. As soon as I walked in, it was a warm and friendly feel. I saw Dr. Steve talking with various clients in a warm and friendly manner. Each one was engaging and smiling. I was called in for an initial consultation. He immediately identified potential issues. He put me on an awesome decompression machine that provided immediate relief. His adjustments were targeted and productive, not the wild cracking you sometimes receive.  I felt much better upon leaving. I was also very surprised when he phoned me last evening to check in and discuss my x-rays. A huge added bonus was that I slept pain free and am not experiencing tightness and stiffness this am. Whew what a relief. I am looking forward to more work from this gifted doctor next week.

Javino, as other reviewers say, has all of the right elements- great location; stylish design and a good menu. We have been there more than 3 times and the same issue has ensued each time. SERVICE.  Usually I go with hubby for a quick date lunch but found myself on my own the other day. I decided to give it another go because I love the walleye sandwich (without the bread). I came in, sat down, and it was at least 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged me. Granted they were brisk, but not super busy. Finally I ordered my favorite- walleye sandwich without the bun; grilled instead of deep fried. Server was very unfriendly and said-"the fish just won't work that way." I said, well I have had it that way on at least 2 other occasions and it was fine. He really kept pushing it but I insisted. I never saw him again until long after the food arrived. The blue cheese on the side salad was divine and the walleye was good but the service will keep me away. They need to understand friendliness.

My hubby and I had our second visit to POSH last evening. We knew what to expect and were just as thrilled as the first visit. We were a bit smarter on our choices, allowing the chef's more flexibility since we learned the first time to stay away from the "tried and true" and let them go. It was awesome. We came early so as to avoid the long waits in our reviews and our dinner was a nice 2 hour pace. Just perfect. Our server, CJ, was friendly, attentive, very well informed (which is important at POSH given the some unusual proteins- particularly some of the fish.) I am allergic to tuna and he quickly identified any fish in the tuna family. We both did the 5 course and opted for our own wine choice instead of the tasting menu. We began with a lychee amuse buche with bee pollen. Sweet and a perfect apertif. I then had a lovely salad with diced radish and a mustard vinagrette. Light and lovely for me. Hubby had a very interesting artichoke heart salad w/cucumber balls, reminiscent of salmon roe. Next up was a lovely crispy red snapper served on a cauliflower puree w/turnips. I could have licked the bowl. He had a monkfish liver that looked interesting. Then our favorite, the veal sweetbreads. They are hard to find in town and these were perfection. We had them last time but this was an entirely different preparation and it was divine. My final protein was the best. If I were on the Food Network Show, "The best thing I ever ate," well, this is it. Chef Josh prepared a duck roulade w/spinach, ramps and a phyllo dough. I have never tasted anything better and I almost forked my husband for stealing one! :) Hubby finished with an elk dish.  We finished w/ a cheese plate as we are not sweet eaters and it was very nice.The entire experience was fabulous. Chef Josh is charming and friendly and very customer focused. We LOVED IT.

A wonderful date night at our favorite spot in town. We opted to sit at the long counter this time to watch the action. It was cool. The only issue is that the seats were a bit tight for Big Daddy to get really comfortable and we were pretty far from the action (my fault for calling at the last minute). I loved sitting there because I like the social aspects of a community spot and it was great fun. Food was exquisite as ever (menu to follow below). We both noticed that Chef Josh (always a charmer) is placing even more emphasis on front of the house interaction. EVERYONE LOVES THAT! It makes it fun and he is so informative that the food goes to another level.  BIg Daddy and my menus combined: Amuse bouche- passion frruite gren tea w/kiwi pudding (good, but sweet for us) Celery root sout w/pumpkin seed oil- DIVINE Cucmber, watermelon, red radis, goat cheese salad Kumamoto Oyster- ponzu soy, chive  Loup de mer w/eggplant mash- YUMMY Foie Gras-BIG DADDY SAID IT IS THE BEST THING EVER. He was swooning and he doesn't ever swoon that much unless I cook! (ulterior motive, but that's another story :)) Kangaroo w/ creamy white polenta- Kangaroo was good- a bit firmer than we expected and the polenta complimented it beautifully.  A lovely protein course. Veal sweet breads- zucchine noodls, shishito peppers and bacon consumme- LOVE THIS- We requested sweetbreads because we lust for them and these were delicious. Chef even gave us tips on how to make them at home (no small feat) The Cheese Course- always prefer savory over sweet - Epoisses de Bourgogne, humbolt fog (hubby's fave) and robiola SUPERB!  The meal was absolutely wonderful. Experience was romantic, fun. No wonder they are always packed in this economy. LOVE IT!

Dr. Frank Sorrentino is the BEST! He has taken care of various back ailments; neck pain; sore shoulders over the many years we have gone to him. But this one, took the cake, so to speak....Several months ago, I injured my left shoulder. I let it go for several months (yes, I know that was a really dumb move) until I finally managed to get frozen shoulder. So, a torn rotator with frozen shoulder. A reasonably scary diagnosis....but Dr. Frank has worked on me for two weeks and the improvement is remarkable. He used ultrasound; therapy and electrode treatments. He has been patient with my wimpiness in the beginning and bent over backwards to get me cortisone injections when I needed them at the acute phase. He went above and beyond and I am very grateful. Dr. Sarah Peddie, is awesome as well and has helped out with my ultrasound. She is soothing and helpful. They are a great team!

After hearing about Gallo Blanco for a while from foodie and chef friends, as well as Yelpers, we decided to give it a go last night as we were picking our son up at the airport later in the evening. We walked in and immediately liked the vibe and diversity in ages and types of people in the room. It immediately gave you a "you are welcome to come in and hang out" feel. We were greeted quickly by our server, Mary. Her slightly edgy look fits the urban scene but is quickly belied by her sweet nature. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and made some great suggestions. We started with Micheadas (BM style) and they were just right. The spice, the flavor of the fresh lime and the bloody mary with the beer was delish and many diners were ordering them. We had a mix of the street tacos- halibut, shrimp, carne asada and pork. Loved the carne asada. My hubby loved the shrimp but just wished there was more than one in it! The corn on the cob with cojita chesse and paprika, JUST STOP IT! It was so good and hubby doesn't normally eat corn but he loved it too. THE BEST! We will definitely be coming back! It was fun, the food was excellent and the service was personal and FUN!

Hi. Have been there many times. Today took a girlfriend there for lunch (her first visit). Was not aware that it was under new management but could tell as soon as we got in with new chairs that gave it a nice ambiance. Our favorite server was there and he was great. Food was good as normal. The issue was the new owner. He overheard us talking and I immediately went to introduce myself and explain that my hubby and I are regulars. He could not have been more unfriendly. He was tense and uptight the whole time that we observed him. Several tables on both sides commented on how awkward it was. I normally will not provide this type of feedback but it has assured me that we will not be back. If he plans on a front of the house presence, he is going to have "to take off his jacket" as my girlfriend said and be more friendly and inviting to his guests.

Okay, so in all fairness, at the invitation of the new owner, Craig, we gave the restaurant another GO. As I stated before, Ricky and Ivan, awesome servers did a great job as usual and the food was really good. I had the Fiesta Chicken, a wonderful dish that surprisingly includes soy sauce mixed with heavy cream and spinach fettucini with sauteed veggies. My favorite dish and really good. Hubby had the broccoli and sundried tomato dish over whole wheat pasta. It was excellent. Most importantly, the owner talked to us about his cool demeanor last time and was visibly "working" the front of the house. Talking to customers, making things move quickly and right. He did a great job. We will now go back to being regulars. I really appreciate when someone takes feedback and hears it. Thank you Craig

My hubby and I are self- proclaimed "Foodies." We loved Chef James at Tapino and were thrilled when we found out they were opening this. As many others have stated the atmosphere is charming and cozy. Reservations are recommended, especially on weekends. We have had dinner and brunch now and both were excellent! The Vicchysoisse (hard to find in Phoenix, the hottest city in the country) is superb as is the Steak Frites. Tradtional french, just like Paris. For brunch, it was the salmon pappilotte (delicious) and beignets (for our 11 year old) and a different twist on eggs benedict for hubby. Really wonderful and authentic. We are bringing our college son in this weekend for Croque Monsieur. Chef James and lovely host Wendy have hit the nail on the head this time. Laurie and Rodney

We love this Over Easy. The food is fresh and delicious. I especially like the egg white and aspargus omelette. Our 22 yr old son loves the WOlf pack and our 13 yr old like the chocolate pancake. Big Daddy and I often share the lox and onions with egg whiles. DIVINE.  Betsy as the new GM has made a tremendous improvement in the atmostphere and fun of the place. Sam is a great server and they run a well oiled machine. They know their regulars and they take care of them. Eat there once or twice a week. Love it!

Hot Dog Stop is a new concept at the Scottsdale Promenade, owned by Lillian and Guy, purveyors of the Cafepino at Scottsdale 101. Hot Dog Stop features gourmet hotdogs including tons of possible combinations and special hotdogs. Every menu item is fresh and carefully created. The owners created the diverse menu and feature creative condiments and fun sides including fried mushrooms and zucchini in addition to the more standard fare of fries. The hotdogs are the stars here  and they are rapidly expanding their client base. The menu has every possible permutation of traditional and new hotdogs including turkey dogs for the health conscious. Even the buns are light as air and stand in second position to the wonderful dogs. This is an excellent value as well with gourmet plates including coleslaw and a pickle at $4.75. They seem to be right on target with a new, innovative concept (creative hotdogs) in a quick serve lovely lunch environment. Fresh pastries adorn the counter including sample of side dishes to entice diners to try new things. The food was excellent and a good choice for a very economical fresh cooked lunch!

Beauregard Food Co has recently updated their menu and it is a wonderful change. We have always enjoyed the Crawfish Boils (when in season) and the Lobster/Crab Boils. These are divine with big heaping platters of seafood cooked in the authentic Boil fashion. A whole Lobster, crab, shrimp andouille sauage, corn, mushrooms and potatoes. Nice heat and more than 2 can eat in one platter. All of this priced at $39! Unbelievable. So, we wandered in for our monthly "Boil" fix last evening and were surprised when the charming owner, Dan Brinton (aka Doughut Dan- he owns the Krispy Kreme next door and several more in town) greeted us with a new menu. It is simply divine. Formerly, there was a large emphasis on fried food. Now, the menu is decidely more focused on fresh food with a cajun emphasis.  We started with the Crab Salad app (served on fresh tomatoes) and it was delicious. Next we tried the Fried Green Tomatoes w/Shrimp Remoulade. Perfectly cooked and light. We sampled several new entrees including my favorite, Shrimp and Crawfish cheesecake, a savory delight that I will order next time. MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH. We then tried the Crawfish Crepes w/creamy crawfish filling, pear glaze, corn maquechoix and collards. True Southern heaven. Our son grabbed both grilled pears off of the plate! Moving to my hubby's favorite, the Shrimp and Grits were awesome. Cheddar grits; bacon, green onions, collards and a creamy cajun buerre blanc. We ended with a Banana Pudding that our son and my hubby literally lapped up! It is a great menu and I urge all of my Yelp friends to check them out.  They are staffed appropriately and it isa lively, fun experience.

We checked out RnR on Sunday (just a few days after opening.) In all fairness, I have to agree with many of the other reviews. Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasn't melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and "come back and try us again." He made no effort to "make things right" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back. There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre. The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables.

Okay, we finally got it. A family friendly, upscale restaurant in DC Ranch that we can walk to! Lush Burger is a fast, casual, yet very upscale new burger concept in DC Ranch. We tried it tonight- went early since they are slammed (shows the demand for affordable, family dining.). You walk into a LUSH (yes, lush, very plush) red and stainless restaurant that is whimsical and very comfortable at the same time. You walk up, order your food and they deliver it to your table. With an extensive menu at affordable price points, we were intrigued. Hubby and I selected lushburger classics with various accoutrements. I had mine "skinny style" with no bun and butter lettuce instead. Our 12 year old ordered the kids 2 baby lushburgers and he loved the veggie option instead of fries. Big Daddy had to try both the truffle fries (divine) and onion rings (crispy and delicious, NO GREASE!) The wine and beer offerings were affordable and fun. You can reorder at your table and don't have to get back in line (which gets fairly long). Our son's chocolate shake was frozen heaven and he licked it all out! The Harris Ranch burgers were moist and cooked perfectly. They were nice sized (important to hubby) and juicy. Next time, he will go for the wings. There is a nice variety of salads, ahi tuna burgers and turkey burgers but we wanted to start with the basics for the first visit. People were having fun and the outside patio was a happening hot spot for sure. Children were more than welcome and the owners were present and meeting guests. They were looking for feedback (important on only a few days open) and were creating a fun vibe. We will definitely be back. Lots of fun and we walked off dinner on the 20 minute walk home! Laurie, Rodney and Maximillian Malone

We wandered into Athena after a movie and were graciously greeted even though we came in the back door! The friendliness of the staff made an inviting start to the evening. Our server, Angelo, acted like an owner. He is greek; knows the menu intimately and was very warm and friendly. We started with the grape leaves (dolmodes) which my hubby normally loves and I only tolerate. THESE WERE DELICIOUS loaded with lamb and rice and a warm, lemony sauce. BEST EVER! Our son had the kid's steak kebobs (chargrilled and sumptious) and we split the night's special- the braised lamb over greek spaghetti. My hubby is a big eater and there was still plenty to take home. The owner came over and introduced himself and the whole experience felt so removed from so many plastic restaurants in town, it was great and we will be back this week!

Great food and server! Loved our shared chicken tortilla soup. Dear Hubby had blackened salmon over a kale salad. I had a burger, cooked mid rare- just divine with a salad with cilantro dressing. Loved it and the owner was as charming as can be. Our server (Justin?) was knowledgeable about all of the food. We will be back!

Hubby and I had an opportunity to head out for some happy hour fun. I decided we should try Narcisse. We walked into the beautiful space and immediately felt the weekend was here! We decided to sit at the bar and get to know the place. We were happily surprised to find that Happy Hour included $5 champagne by the glass. It was Domaine St. Michelle, and tasted just fine. We ordered fried pickles (delicious) and the beef carpaccio, which was divine. We then asked the charming owner, Todd,

We are HUGE fans of Chef James Porter from his Tapino days. How many Chefs in this Valley or anywhere else have pulled off (successfully, Tapino's- known for its fine cuisine and locavore dinners; Petite Maison (our very favorite) and now Big Earls BBQ, named for James' beloved father) 3 restaurants that are completely different? Chef is a huge fan of offal and so is my hubby. We sampled the fried sweetbreads (very different); bone marrow (DELICIOUS) and the pig's tails (everyone enjoyed them but wanted BBQ sauce instead of ranch dressing). This is a sampling over two weeks- lunch on Sat and dinner tonight. For our evening cuisine, we wanted to sample the ribs (my husband could have eaten them with a spoon- they fell off the bone and I don't like ribs but loved them). The smoke was subtle and the texture wonderful. I had the pulled chicken bbq sandwich, priced at a very reasonable price point and enough food for two people easily. We tried sides of greens; corn bread and potato salad. All were very good fare and a step above most barbeque spots. The vibe is nice; the atmosphere is comfortable and it is a casual, affordable, DIFFERENT type of place in Old Town. YEAH! We need diversity and options. I am not a huge bbq person but was the one pushing to come back tonight. Great food, Chef even worked with Desert Smoke to create the sauces. Delicious! We will be back! Laurie and Rodney Malone

We have had 3 meals here- twice for brunch and finally, last Sat. for dinner. The atmosphere is fun and funky as other reviewers have noted. It was a great place to bring a couple with us who generally won't venture out of their neighborhood. The brunch menu is good and I had the Pozole both times. DIVINE, and with a nice added twist with the littleneck clams. Nice spice with the serranos and overall a great dish. I almost forgot, we started with the shrimp and avocado creme ceviche. Everyone at the table loved it . Hubby ordered Barbacoa and loved it. My friend had the fish tacos. I had the carne asada tacos. Succulent and just the right size.

Well, appearances do not always tell the story. Nondescript from the outside, the completely transformed Tom Thumb's market is AWESOME. For two weekends in a row, we have walked (yes, walked) there for breakfast. My hubby had been raving about the caprese sandwich (at a gas station?), the cubano and the bbq. We had 'pigs and grits' for breakfast (we split it- huge serving) and it was divine. Beautiful pulled pork smothered in Low Country bbq sauce over creamy grits! Delicious. The following week we split a smoked turkey egg white omelet. It was equally good. Priced well and quite a surprise. The people are very friendly and we will be back. We were so glad this gas station and carwash re-opened. The car wash is professional. When I took my car in for a hand wash, I asked for how long it would take. They told me and hit the time on the dot with no hardsell for other things. Great experience.

We are pleased to be the first reviewers of Mia Francesca. DC Ranch has been needing something different and we finally have it! This charming Italian restaurant, owned by a privately held larger company, feels like a locally owned restaurant. The restaurant is warm and inviting and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. We were immediately greeted by Lori, the catering manager who was kind and engaging. We met our server, the tall and statuesque Dora, and the meal began.She knows the menu completely and had recommendations.  The price points were reasonable- one diner nearby said, "FINALLY, we have a GO TO restaurant here with the right price point that isn't based around a bar." This is a charming restaurant and the food was exceptional. I am Italian and never would have guessed this is a chain. Beginning with the wine, the price points were reasonable. I would suggest a "house wine" carafe price for a red and a white and watch them sell like crazy. Wine snobs won't buy them, but regular people will......  Next came the delectable bread with the house-made extra virgin olive oil infused with fresh herbs. DIVINE. Dora warned us it was addictive and she was right.  Big Daddy ordered the spaghetti bolognese as he is a self-professed conneisseur and he loved it. It was rustic, with three different meats; fresh tomatoes; carrots; onions; and other sumptious items cooked for 8 hours. We are really picky about bolognese and I intend to order it next week. AWESOME. He asked for linguine and it was given! They have a whole wheat option (Big Daddy is big on fiber :)) and they only had a penne. Good choice, but they should consider a whole wheat spaghetti or linguine for people who want it.  Our Maximillian (14) loved the spaghetti with tomato sauce. I tasted it with a cook's palette and it was light, perfectly seasoned and good. I would order it myself for sure.  I had the Spinach ravioli. The ravioli was clearly house-made and the spinach stuffing was delicious. The tomato cream sauce and fresh spinach on top were great, only needing a few red pepper flakes (which I received upon request) to balance the dish out.   Dessert was tiramusu and flourless chocolate cake with chocolate peppermint ice cream. They were both delicious but the tiramusu won the day.  Finally, we met Jeff Cohen, Director of Operations for the West Coast for this organization. A lofty title that we are sure is well deserved. Most importantly, to us, he seemed like the sole proprietor of a local joint. That was the best. We came to find out that his daughter, goes to our son's school. A small world. He clearly takes personal pride in opening these restaurants. We would sure like to see more of him.  Thank you for a great new restaurant in our neighborhood!  Laurie, Rodney and Maximillian Malone

Great vibe when you walk in. It feels like a happening Scottsdale hotspot and it is. You walk in the place is literally pulsing with music and people (all ages). We were ushered into a quiet room and greeted by Tory, who recommended the VIP specialty cocktail. Hubby had one and it was delicious- a pineapple infused vodka martini. Normally not my thing but it was good. We chose our entrees and a nice bottle of Schug cab-merlot blend that was reasonably priced. For dinner, hubby had the chicken schnitzel- sounds funny at a steak house but he loved it. It was pounded thin and covered in zucchini accents on pappardelle. Yummy, but too big for me! :) I had my dream dinner- a beautiful medium rare cooked strip steak over a delicious salad with arugula, blue cheese, lettuce, baby tomatoes and a lemon vinagrette. Absolutely perfect. It was accented by two deviled eggs that my husband immediately whisked off of my plate. Finally, the meal was completed with a chocolate bread pudding and adult milkshake, which was not too sweet. All in all, a great experience and we will be back. The service, starting with Tory and complemented by the bussers, was superb. Great job!

Alex does a superior job managing this location. She is VERY knowledgeable (as is Anthony) but she really literally knows everything. She is always calm and polite, particularly because they always seems understaffed with 3 or 4 people in line.   Alex goes above and beyond for her clients daily.  Warm regards,  Laurie Malone

Hubby and I were excited to try Taco Haus as we are big fans of Brat Haus. Anything Payton does is going to be done fresh and excellent. We started with the halibut ceviche. It was light and flavorful.The Asian preparation was great for the fish. Hubby ordered the pork belly tacos and asked for the house made salsas to add spice. He said that he is ordering the same dish again. I ordered the 1/2 rotisserie chicken. The skin was thin and crispy (the way I like it) and the inside juicy and mouthwatering. Hubby had to help me eat it as they was so much there. Two delicious sides came with it- my favorite was the street corn topped with spicy popcorn and 13 beans slow cooked with pork belly (Big Daddy's favorite.) The drinks were fairly priced and the tres leches dessert literally melts in your mouth. The servers were friendly and well informed; the atmosphere is "joint like" with great music- makes you want to hang out for a while. This Saturday we are bringing our whole crew in for lunch to try more things.

My hubby and I had an exceptional lunch here today. We enjoyed great food, excellent wine and superb service. Mike G. and his manager (sorry did not get his name) went above and beyond to explain menu choices, ensure that everyone was done to perfection. We started with the Mushroom Soup, which was sublime. It was, by far, the best mushroom soup I have ever tasted. The table next to us said the same thing. Then I had the brick chicken (swoon) and hubby had the smoked pastrami sandwich. He is STILL talking about it. Instead of fries, he opted for brussel sprouts and I thought he was going to lick the plate. The service and ambiance are a cut above. We will be back within a week or so.  AWESOME!

First of all, German Osio has outdone himself. We LOVE all of his restaurants and have always frequented them, but this is a cut above. First of all, the design by Jeff Low Design (who was there and we had the pleasure of meeting him) is exquisite and a definite stand out in Scottsdale. Big Daddy and I definitely felt as if we were in a New York or Tokyo restaurant. Sleek, focusing on eclectic faces on chairs with a lovely tree to lighten the space. We went for lunch today but will go in for dinner within a week.  We began with two lovely cocktails- Bill DeGroot did a great job with fresh flavors. I loved my Pineapple Pisco. Big Daddy had first the grapefruit concoction and loved it and second, a Green tree cocktail (sorry don't remember the names). They were light, lovely and fresh. Chef Herb Wilson brings a big city vibe to Scottsdale with this menu. Mexican Asian Fusion sounds challenging at first. We began with Head on Shrimp that were superb in a garlic and jalopeno sauce. I could not go in without ordering that again. Secondly, we had the Kimchi Fried Rice. We have eaten fried race all over the world and this was absolutely delicious. Crispy, slightly spicy, perfectly cooked with nuances. DIVINE. We had two orders- it was that good. We also tried the Mexican Pho  which is a red chile based soup. Delicious and complex, it filled us up. We will be in within the week to sample the dinner menu which looks divine. "Sparkles'", the nickname of our well informed server made the meal. She was able to describe the food in very accurate detail and was very concerned with our satisfaction.  All in all, a superior lunch experience in Scottsdale. The friendliness of  the house and the divine food made this a thumbs up for us. Keep it up Chef Herb! Laurie and Rodney Malone

Big Daddy and I came back for Happy Hour. Awesome as the first time.  Sat at the bar with Jeremy, who was slinging drinks, recommending food and chatting up customers better than Tom Cruise in Cocktail ( he is not old enough to know that movie.:). We had Chicharron de pollo with Miso Mustard.  The miso mustard balanced the crispy chicken.  Next was Rock Shrimp Tempura with a truffle aioli that we loved.  The secret sauce, In house made Mango Habanero sauce that Jeremy shared kicked it up a notch.  Finally we ended with the Chinese Style Crab Garlic Noodles.  Foodie food for sure.  Delicately composed, with a nice depth in flavor.  The garlic was surprisingly subtle, but there.  The spice was just right.  A dish we will order again! We will be back!  Atmosphere is crowded but bearable. We will be back!

We had lunch there yesterday. It was AWFUL! We were doing business after so we didn't want a messy basket, plus they didn't have crawfish. We ordered the gumbo- came out lukewarm- server graciously reheated it but it had 2 shrimp and 2 slices of sausage. It was all soup and rice. We love gumbo and this was disappointing. Then we ordered the soft shell crab. It was so over breaded that you could not taste any crab. By far, the worst we have ever had anywhere. We then decided to try the fried shrimp, again, over breaded and not good.   We paid $40 for the lunch with tip and left very dissatisfied. The food was unappetizing and we had stomach aches all afternoon and evening. We will never go back.  We will go back to Hot and Juicy for sure however. It seems as if this management is distracted away from fish with BBQ.

My hubby, daughter and I enjoyed a lovely brunch at Snooze yesterday. We are excited for them to open in Scottsdale, near where we live. I must say the art deco, bright ambiance gives the proper anticipation of a fun meal. I started with an MMMmmm Mimosa which was light and lovely. Carlene, our server, made the entire experience excellent. She even had a whimsical bacon and egg hair clip that she made. Shows you right off the bat, she loves her work. Since it was our first visit she brought us (on her) the pineapple upside down pancake with cinnamon butter. I don't even like sweets, but it was DIVINE! We all scooped it up. Our sweet daughter had the tomato soup and grilled cheese, which she loved. The soup almost tasted like a marinara. Very fresh and delicious. I had the lox, rye, capers, herbed goat cheese, and arugula plate. It was very good. My husband had the corned beef hash. It came out cold and they immediately retired it and made it right. The manager( forgot his name- glasses and a ponytail) did a great job of assuring that it would be perfect the next time.   All in all, we are not going to want to wait until the end of August when Kierland opens so we will be back. BRAVO! Laurie and Rodney Malone

We really enjoyed this new brew pub. It starts at good when you get fried pickles that barely have a breading on them and are deliciously briny and decadent with a cucumber dill sauce to accompany. We split the burger (going out that night) and it was divine- especially the cheese curds on top. With a luscious challah bun, roasted tomatoes and a garlic aioli, it was delicious. We sampled a couple of beers and they are great! It has a nice bright atmosphere and the service was great. Welcome to Scottsdale for sure! We will be back. Laurie and Rodney Malone

This was our third visit.  The absolute BEST sushi in town.  Tonight was our first opportunity with Happy Hour.   Great value pointed out by Jade, our wonderful server.  We tasted grilled squid, miso black cod ( the definition of Unctuous) and the edamame for the kids.  Fabulous.  Then had the Blind Phoenix for hubby ( I am allergic to tuna) and he loved it.  We asked for tagaroshi on the side and Jade totally got it.  Brendan did a great job running the food.  Our 17 year old son loved the ramen and our 9 year old daughter ate the chicken with ramen noodles. She loved it.  We had salmon and cream cheese and many other roles.  The spider was my favorite.  Josh, the manager spoke to us and appreciated our comments.  A great experience!

My hubby and I hosted a Tasting Dinner last Thursday at Bonefish. The evening kicked off with Chef Michael introducing himself graciously to the table and asking about food sensitivities and allergies. We had two gluten free (one dairy free) and one tuna allergy. He accommodated all of the special requests perfectly. With a table full of foodies, we were set to go!  The evening exceeded our expectations. We were hosting 12 people in the bar for a lovely dinner. We started with a plethora of appetizers including the famous Bang Bang Shrimp (crispy texture with just the right hint of spice in the sauce), Lamb chops (divine- carmelized and mid rare; lollipop size- my husband's hands down favorite app); ahi tuna served sashimi style (one of our friends said it was her favorite for sure); delicate beef potstickers with a nuanced sauce. Chef even improvised and made an gluten free Shrimp Italiano that was delicate yet luscious in flavor.  They were so many delicious apps on the table, we could have called it dinner! All of it was served with a lovely white blend and heavier red wine. Pomegranate martinis were a huge hit as were the fresh pear martinis. Most of us had Uber'ed so everything was flowing nicely!  The fish course, consisting of 4 tasting pieces each was the highlight of the evening for me personally. The first dish was a delicious jumbo shrimp paired with scallops. We also had a fresh salmon in butter sauce (my favorite- it had none of the strong overwhelming flavor that salmon can sometimes have); flame grilled grouper that Hubby LOVED! and finally a lovely sea bass balanced with a fresh mango salsa. Absolutely OUTSTANDING!   The final course was non fish and featured Filet Mignon perfectly cooked with a chimichurri sauce. One of our friends said this was her favorite of the night. Next was "Lily's Chicken" which included artichokes, sun dried tomatoes and was SO good. The other hit of the meat course was the pork tenderloin cooked with fresh sage and fontina. It was moist and delicious.  With full bellies, we ordered coffees and Expresso Martini's for some. The Martini drinkers loved them and said they could sip them all night! John, the Managing Partner came out and greeted us at that time and everyone told him how much they enjoyed the meal.   Two of my chocoholic girlfriends almost jumped out of their seats when they saw the trio of desserts- gluten free chocolate brownie with ice cream (have you seen grown women literally SWOON?), key lime pie (one of the choco centric gals said THIS dessert was her favorite) and last but not least a delicious coconut pie- not cream like you usually see- just delicious coconut in a delicate crust.  This review would not be complete without highlighting our awesome server, Joe. He is a true professional and did a fantastic job with keeping up with our lively, demanding table. THANKS JOE! YOU ARE THE BEST!  Bonefish outdid themselves with this awesome evening! A big thank you to Chef Michael and John for their efforts! We had a ball!

My hubby and I had a "date lunch" there yesterday. Despite being open only a week, they have the place running very smoothly. What A PLEASANT CHANGE FROM THE PREVIOUS OWNERS! These folks are the ones that created the original Chez Vous. Richard and Isabella know how to run a restaurant and their new partner from France, Bruno, is charming and knows the menu! We had a lovely wine and then some Bruchetta including a shrimp, tomato and avocado one; peppered salami and pickle, and smoked salmon with chives and cream cheese. Light and airy- not greasy! Then we ordered a beautiful cheese plate including a Blue Cheese (appropriately blue veined and delicious), Sumptious Brie and another white cheese from the border of France and Italy (can't remember the name). All served with toasted bread, coronations, grapes and walnuts.   The decor has a smart, yet comfortable look. A huge update and change to it's previous look. Adding to the charm, was a group of the owner's friends who working speaking french rapidly. Loved it- felt we were back in Paris from last year.  We will be back- this is a huge upgrade to the Shea food scene. My only suggestion was that they expand the menu to include a soup.   It was a lovely experience and Richard/Bruno were charming and lovely. Abientot!
