Over the years I have been to Hillstone/Houston's over 200 times and I can easily say that everything is out of this world. The spinach and artichoke dip, cheeseburger, ribs, fish, french dip, hawaiin steak, the apple cobbler dessert...all amazing....They do everything right here and all for a great price. I never decline an opportunity to go to Hillstone. Did I mention they have a sushi menu? Be sure to get the coconut shrimp roll. It has sauce on the tray that it comes with but be sure to ask for extra! I always imagine if they were to have a brunch/brekafast menu, what it would be like. I think I would cry of happiness if they ever did.

People don't give this place enough credit. Sure its big and the menu is even bigger, filled with a lot of whatever food..but if you go for the right reasons, then its an amazing spot to go. Here are the only reason's to go to The Cheesecake Factory.  1) It's open relatively late, I think after midnight 2) Brown Bread with Butter--out of this world 3) Avacado Egg Rolls--mmmmm 4) Louisiana Chicken Pasta-A lot of food, nice tangy taste  you could easily share this with two people. ask them to split #4 with your guest.

I love coming here for breakfast/brunch, especially since they serve it until 2pm. I used to go once a week when I lived in Scottsdale but now I make sure I go at least once whenever I visit. Steak and eggs can be hit or miss (the steak)...I usually get the french toast special, trust me, a half order is more than enough! its 4thick slices...,I get two eggs over medium with it and hashbrowns extra crispy to replace the meat. This is a lot of food for less than $10. Amazing.

Two words, CHICKEN PANINI!!!! Actually, I'd like to add the mixed basket of fries. The burger is great too but I always default to the panini. I have never had anything like it. Its fantastic. The atmosphere is pretty cool and the staff are friendly. Its open until 2am so its always a great place to go for late night eats. Definitely go here, you wont regret it.

I got my haircut from Joel himself, and let me tell you, he does an amazing job. He really takes the time to figure out what you're looking for and then magically crafts your hair to the best result possible. I've had my hair cut in Paris and NY and he is just as good as the top hair-stylists there and definitely better than anywhere in AZ. Pay the $$ and go.

this plays blows.. the food is decent but the portions are tiny..the main course was smaller than an appetizer at a normal place yet they charge the same if not more. if you choose to eat here, prepare to hit up some mcdonalds or jack in the box after.. or you can just go to deluxe next door and get their chicken panini!

prepare to spend a few hours here and really have a romantic experience. the food is divine. the service is laid back (in a good way). the chef runs the whole show and plays all hats. the menu is forever changing and when you make a reservation he will ask you questions so he can tailor your meal and experience to your needs. probably not a good first date place because if the date goes wrong, you will be stuck for a while. perfect spot for an anniversary or something. or even just to have a nice meal with people you know and care about.

This place is a 4 star hotel and lives up to it. I didn't like the fact that they charge a resort fee for internet and gym access...its not even optional, its mandatory. If its mandatory why don't you just add it to the price of the hotel room initially and not sneak it on?? That was messed up, luckily its only $20 a night. Service was good, there wasn't a horrific line to checkin like some of the other vegas hotels. The rooms were clean and the technology in them was pretty cool. I would stay here again.

This place is very impressive. High class, trendy, and really comfortable. It is double the price as regular theatres...but those are regular theatres.  If you want, you can partake in additional services like ordering food or drinks while watching your movie or you can simply just go to enjoy the movie.  I dont think all movies deserve the level of attention and class that is offered at this theatre but on special occassions or for special movies, definitely go.  If you reserve online and become a memeber you get free benefits too. do it!

Divine. A bit pricey but its vegas so its ok and totally worth it. Try and go with one other person and just buy a whole pizza and split it, it will be much cheaper. It's open late night which is great and the pizza flavor is really good...and thats coming from a new yorker!

I went here for the food and it was horrific. I guess I did it wrong because I didn't get champagne or tea. I got coffee lol. It was pretty good coffee though but the breakfast burrito sucked. A lot of food, but gross. On to the next one.

I used to live in AZ and would frequent Oasis and every time I go back to visit family and friends I always stop by. This is the go to place for hookah in AZ. They make great flavored hookah's and are happy to share and mix as many options as requested. They take pride in their hookah and their food is surprisingly delicious. They have music some nights and live entertainment too so be sure to check it out. Full bar and hookah til late also make this spot a frequent after club place to go.

This place is awesome. Everything from the ambiance and the coffee to the ipad credit card signing app makes you feel good about being here. They have an ice-coffee item not on the menu that's already cold coffee, i like to get that. I think its called a totty. Ask for it! Also, the cookies and muffins are great too, definitely not a disappointment.

The people here are actually pretty nice and helpful. The burger wasn't that great but what I really liked were the tot-chos. YOU HAVE TO GET THESE. AMAZING!!! really unhealthy but so delicious. They have some great flatscreen's too and they offer coke products which is nice because I love orange fanta. Definitely check this place out.

This place is an embarrassment to Mexican food. You couldn't pay me to come back here. The food was disappointing and the service was weak. Can't wait to see what replaces this dump in a few months.
