I was lucky enough to stop in here for a quick dinner over the weekend. Can a dinner be quick and romantic? Yes it can.  We were early, so the place was pretty empty. Having the room to yourself? Romantic +1   The Coronado is in a great old Craftsman style building, with separate rooms full of beautiful wooden fixtures and great old built-ins. Even the bright, pedestrian art contributed to the cozy, yet polished vibe.  We started off with drinks from the cocktail menu. My date had some sort of gin and lemonade that was delicious. My "Enter the Dragon"? A bit too cough syrupy, but that was completely my fault for ordering something with "raspberry vodka" and expecting any different. Both were strong.  The crusty, chewy bread came with a quality olive oil and fruity balsamic for dipping. We inhaled the first plate, and got seconds when dinner arrived.  I ordered the Filipino-style beef salad, which was FULL of melt-in-your-mouth thinly sliced ribeye, and my date got the goat cheese relleno with creamy polenta.  That chef has got it goin on! The grilled veggies in the relleno were not mushy, and the polenta wasn't grainy. My ribeye had crispy edges but rare centers and there was a perfect balance of dressing to greens.   Our server was attentive and efficient without being all up in our business and the prices seemed reasonable for the quality.  Thank you, Coronado. I will be back.

Things I loved:  The Thom Kha Ta-lay (med) was creamy, spicy, and FULL of seafood and fresh kaffir leaves. The chicken satay had a nice char but was still juicy (so rare!). The cucumber and onion relish was surprisingly sweet and a great counter to the heat.   Things I only liked: The Pork Kwediaw Kraphrao (mint and pepper stir fry with egg noodles) was not as mediumly spiced and could have used a touch more mintyness. They were out of Pumpkin Custard, which made me very sad as it sounded awesome.  Verdict:  I would go back to try a curry or rice dish, for sure!

So far, I have been very pleased by Dr. Woodbury's office and staff. They were able to work with my schedule (tough, since I don't have time off at my new job, yet), and were able to fit me in at the last minute for my xrays.  I had some concerns about one of my teeth, and the doctor took extra time to look over the xrays with me and let me know that my tooth was fine and what I could do to mitigate any discomfort.   While the hygienist was a little bit rushed, I won't hold that against them because they were all working a half-day and I was the last (squeezed in at the last minute) patient. Because of this, I am even more pleased with the doctor's helpful and empathetic manner.   They handled all of my paperwork while I was getting x-rayed (rather than waiting for me to finish first) which made it, overall one of the most efficient visits I have ever had to a dentist.   I still have to get my full cleaning, and reserve the right to update my review then (grin), but so far I have already recommended Dr. Woodbury to friends and coworkers.

I want to give this place 3.5 stars. Four for food and three for atmosphere.   The space is a awkward (one shared bathroom?), and the check out system is nuts and leads to crazy lines. I can only imagine how frustrating it gets during week day lunch rush... But, the food was very good. I had a chicken shawarma platter and it came with a great amount of food. My dining companion had the greek salad, which was generously feta'd. The pita was warm and the rose water lemonade was fantastic. That said, the server was great and you can buy some crazy groceries on your way out.

You should not drink the awesome coffee at Lux.   There are already a LOT of people doing that, and some days it is REALLY crowded. So, you know, feel free to steer clear.   I know the baristas are top notch, in every way! From pulling the perfect shot all the way down to making the cool foam flowers on top of the lattes and all; they can't be beat. They even have about a million Republic of Teas for the coffee-free folks. And yes, the pastries and cakes and cookies are all made lovingly onsite every day... I really get why you would *want*  to spend every morning here.  Granted, the fact that the owner, Jeff, makes an effort to learn the names of all his customers is really awesome. He and his staff  are friendly and the interplay between the employees and the regulars instill this really warm and fuzzy sense of belonging in everyone who hangs out there. I could see how that might make you want to come by and sip a cuppa.   And I understand that the intriguing art work and comfy couches make it a very inviting place to hang out... what with all the outlets everywhere and two wireless networks. It really is a great place to get some work done, network (if that's your thing), or just sit and rap with a cool stranger. But you probably should stay away. One cup and you're going to be hooked for good. Then where will I sit?

I love Lux, and now that I've left downtown Phoenix living for good, I will miss it.  I am going to give it five stars instead of four, because Jeff, the owner, more than makes up for the crowds with his great customer service. He gets to know his regulars by name and encourages all of the staff to do the same.   To the reviewer who was bummed out that they didn't know what a "cafe ole" was... I think you MEANT "cafe au lait." It's a French drink, not a Spanish cheer.  Yeah it's crowded. Yeah there are often too many hipsters (my little sister said that she'd have to find some Buddy Holly glasses to wear in next time, so she'd fit in better). But the coffee is great, the baked goods are awesome, and the staff is capable, courteous, and kicks much ass.

So my valentine took me to St. Francis for our V-day dinner. I don't know if they are as awesom on non-holidays, but they really aced Valentines!  Our waitress was well informed and seemed genuinely stoked at our choices. She was attentive without being all up in our business, and each course lingered just long enough for us to get to chat conspiratorily throughout the meal.   I had the celery root soup (delicate, yet rich and not at all chalky), the seared scallops (large, but not quite as sweet as they could have been. the garnish made for a beautiful as well as tasty plating), and the chocolate-grand marnier fondue (the best part was when the waitress came by and said that fingers were TOTALLY allowed in the fondue pot... and oh yes I did). We had a couple of cocktails which were a perfect balance between fruity and liquory.   The space is a nice blend of industrial and intimate. The rust and steel exposed beams and cement fixtures give the small space a cool, modern feel, while the solid wood tables and delicate place settings make it feel romantic. I loved eating inside with the large doors open to the patio.  The only reason I am giving 4 out of 5 is that, while I love restaurants with patios, the location of St Francis--on busy Camelback--makes me want a bit more of a privacy fence around the tables. Maybe live bamboo or something? I can't imagine that it's too lovely seeing fights in front of the Walgreens or hearing the traffic right next to your table. But avoid all that and get an inside table!   Be sure to check out the cool chalk board on the wall opposite the restrooms--it has seasonal recommendations for fruit, veggies, herbs, meat, and seafood. I wish I had a poster of it!

UPDATE: Since my last review, the folks at Urban Yoga and I have had a couple of in-depth conversations about my experiences. It is nice to see a local business committed to customer communication.  They listened to my concerns and made several suggestions for things I could do to make my time spent at their business less frustrating.   As it stands, I would not recommend any of the Urban/Power/Candlelight Flow classes to a beginner, whether you are new to yoga altogether or just new to the vinyasa style. They recommend Slow Flow and they offer it a couple of times a week (more are planned to be scheduled).   The Core class and Zen class are still going to be in my regular rotation -- they give a good workout regardless of your level. And as I mentioned before the boutique is really fabulous--even if you don't do yoga!  ORIGINAL REVIEW (***)  I am blown away by all of the positive reviews of this place, really. I have been practicing yoga off and on for nearly 13 years. I am comfortable with many poses and even know the Sanskrit names for some of them. But somehow I still get lost in UY's "flow" classes and the instructors seem totally ok with that.   I tried 2 different "urban flow" classes and a "candlelight flow". They often didn't demonstrate a sequence at all and one explained it away saying she didn't want students to think we need to look like she does... Isn't the whole reason I am getting instruction is so that my form can get as close to perfect as possible?   I've taken a lot of Bikram, and the instructors don't perform the poses, but they make up for that by giving explicit, descriptive, and consistent direction. Here, they say "now do your own vinyasa and let's meet back in downward dog" and you are supposed to divine from that "move from plank, to chaturanga dandasana, to cobra, to d dog." I mean, I gathered that... But they can't say something like, "now let's do the vinyasa flow together once"? I was never asked how long I have been doing yoga, or if I had any injuries or anything--questions I have been asked at every other studio I have been to.   My friend is new to yoga, he struggled for the whole hour, only getting help from the teacher once... She said if anyone got lost, to watch the girls in the front of the room--who were all doing different things, and who we only had one view of (the back) since they line the class up with the mirrors on the side instead of the front. This was the second flow class I brought him to, and it was just as confusing to him as the first. He didnt know what "do your vinyasa" meant, if it was supposed to be the same each time... And he was left to flounder in a class that is supposedly great for all levels. If an instructor or series is not actually explained for beginners, it should be listed clearly as recommended for intermediate or advanced.  We did not receive any recommendations on how to modify, how to use the props... just "do your own vinyasa and watch someone else." She finally came by and handed him a block--nearly 50 minutes into the class.  After my first couple of classes, I thought maybe this studio is just ideally suited to experienced yogis, but I am experienced and I still felt lost and unimportant to my instructors. What I think now, is that Urban is designed with their own regulars in mind. If you are willing to tough out enough classes to learn all the shorthand-speak that is used in lieu of actual direction, you might be able to get a good practice from them. If you already know all the common vinyasa flow sequences, you may also do alright, I don't know. I have done years of hatha, Bikram, and even taken kundalini, ashtanga and vinyasa classes before and I've always done ok. And here I did ok. But not great. I didn't feel good when I got out of class, I felt inadequate and exhausted from trying to catch up for over an hour.  Two classes, urban core and urban zen, were both taught with instructors that demonstrated both full and modified poses, so I am giving them a star for that. I enjoyed those classes and the instructors. I got a workout and felt pushed in all the best ways. Plus, the space itself--both studios, lockerrooms, and retail, is all really gorgeous and well-maintained.  Between the space and the location they get another star, you can't beat being right at the lightrail or free parking fir convenience.  Maybe vinyasa just isn't really my thing, after all. Maybe the last time I took a vinyasa class and liked it, I just had a particularly energized and helpful instructor and I got the wrong impression.  I get a way better workout, feel much more focused, and receive more instructor engagement at the Bikram studi

The tortas are amazing. The tacos have simple, yet fresh and flavorful ingredients. The guacamole is the best I've had in town, hands down.  But you wanna know the BEST thing about Gallo Blanco?  Sunday brunch.   The breakfast stuff is always available and they probably do brunch all weekend, I don't know. I DO know that I have been twice on an early Sunday afternoon, and when every other "cool" brunch spot had lines around the block, my dining companion and I were able to walk right in and sit down here.  My brunch favorites:  * Egg torta. The flavors are simple, but rich.  * Egg and chorizo. How do they keep the sausage juicy without being greasy? It's a kitchen marvel.  * Pancakes. OK, their pancake might just be perfect. It has delicately crispy edges and a custardy center. No chewy frisbee at Gallo Blanco. Deluxe! * A simple thing, but fresh squeezed OJ really hits the spot and makes a delightful mimosa.  They only lose a star because they could use a few more breakfast offerings. Like breakfast tacos.  Of course telling you all this probably means a line this Sunday. But it's worth it, everyone should know about this hidden gem!

I would like to give Hula the bar (and place for burgers) 5 stars, but Hula the brunch spot, 3.  I have always been served a strong snd affordable drink here, and the bloody mary was no exception, but it was a little watery and could have used a celery stalk. Though for only $5, I shouldn't complain. I got a little buzz, and that's admirable in a bloody mary.  I ordered the special omelet, which this weekend featured shrimp and a grilled mix of peppers and onions.  The good: the portions were healthy and the eggs had a good "fried in butter" flavor. The shrimp were perfect, not at all  dry or bland.  The hasbrowns, however, were pretty oily and otherwise unremarkable. Next time I would probably sub for Hawaiian toast and fruit.  The omelet had a sweet sauce. The server said it was mango, I believe. Regardless, it was distracting and didn't add to the eggs well at all.   Otherwise, the crowd was lively and personable, if a little over-tanned and "out to be seen." just like the other places on this block, it is loud, so don't come for romance or a lounge scene. And unlike most spots that could be described as "trendy" the staff here is approachable and laid-back.  I was stoked for another breakfast spot in the hood, but would probably return to Maizie's next time.  Luckily, there's always after dark. The nighttime scene here is great, and I definitely think they do a better burger than their neighbor.

I'm giving them four stars even though they only take cash, which frankly is a huge hassle, and would probably be enough for me to stop going if this little coffee-shop weren't so darned awesome.  Let me count the ways: 1. Walking distance to the library. Books are to coffee as cigars are to scotch. 2. Bright, open. This place has good light and a lovely modern interior.  3. Pretty good breakfast burritos, especially for a coffee shop.  4. That "Smoke Jumper" spicy quad shot will kick you square in the pants. 5. If you prefer a more gentle wake-up, the Vanilla Honey Latte is more like your grandma rustling your shoulder and saying "Sweetie? time to get up!" in her best inside voice. 6. The little desk spots are the best for computerating. 7. Slow Sundays. In a downtown coffee shop, this is a HUGE plus. 8. There are more parking spots in back. 9. Did I mention the library? And the museum? It's what some folks call a "pedestrian cell" --you know, when you can walk to stuff? And they are in general sorely lacking 'round here.   If you forget cash, resign yourself to shuffling over to the CVS with the morning tweakers.

Oh man, this was a good dinner! There were rumors about La Condesa: awesome salsa bar, tasty cheap tacos...I am glad to say that both of those rumors are TRUE!  I had a chicken mole taco which had just a couple too many red onions on it (which were easily dispatched). The mole was rubbed into the chicken rather than glooped on top, so the fragrant smokiness really soaked into the chicken. I liked this taco even better with a spoonful of the juicy strawberry salsa on top.  I also sampled the carne asada burro. Simple handmade flour tortilla (I could eat them plain for days), filled with black beans and beef. The meat had a deep flavor and was slow-cooked tender. Again, a dollop from the large assortment of salsas, this time the creamy cilantro, made good taste great.  My calabacitas were grilled just right: nice char marks, but with some body still left to the slices.   La Condesa only loses a point because the chips could have been better (fresher) and the parking in front is rather harrowing. Otherwise, it is going in the regular rotation. I hope they have t-shirts sometime soon with some of the amazing artwork!

I wanted to talk with this gym about membership options, but due to a tight schedule, was only able to talk by phone.   I was told that was impossible, and that if I wasn't "willing" to come to the gym for the hard sell, then I clearly wasn't committed enough to my fitness goals.  What a way to guarantee no-sale! It is nice to know right away that everyone is just a number, a body to them. If they treat me so poorly when they WANT my money, I can only imagine what the "service" is like once they've got it.   No thanks, Gold's. I deserve better.

OK, here's the deal. Donna Jean's is not my kind of hangout. But that doesn't mean she hasn't met the needs of her regulars and neighbors.  When we pulled up, we could hear the opening band covering "Beat It" with a decidedly head-banging guitar solo during the bridge. There were some pickups in the parking lot, and a long-haired, white cowboy boot wearing rocker unloading equipment.   I was nervous.  See, my good friend's band was scheduled third, or would never even have traveled so far North and West for drinks. The crowd was full of several Westside rollergirls and their entourage. They were there (according to the onstage shoutout) to listen to the country-rootsy-metally opener. To be honest, I expected the kind of cool service at the bar that one can expect from "locals-only" types of hangouts, but Donna Jean--I'd like to think it was the real DJ, even if it wasn't--was friendly, if a bit reticent.  Once my friends got on stage, many of the rollergirls left, but the locals stuck around. The sound guy was a bit pushy, resulting in an over-fuzz that was distracting, but otherwise the sound was good. The stage seemed roomy, and was even decorated with many intense black-light posters, which took me back to my stoner youth.  The beers are reasonably priced, the drinks seem strong (if the wheeling around and crazy-eyes of the other patrons are any indication), and there are a lot of things to do in this trim little Glendale bar.  Libations has pool tables, darts, videogames, even a cigarette machine. Plus bands, many of whom are actually good, and a ton of high pub-style tables and stools with a good view of the stage.  They definitely lose a star for the curtains-instead-of-doors decor in the ladies room.  Will I be back? Probably not unless my guy's band plays there again. But I'm not going to hold that against Donna Jean and her regulars--they've got their thing going on.

The guys at LG have taken really great care of my car. I originally picked their shop because it was close. I am so glad I did! The first time was after an accident. They helped me to get a rental, worked with the insurance company, and got the work done quickly.   The workmanship was great. The service was incredible. So when my check engine light came on, I called them to see if they could help. They've worked with me to get my car back on the road for a price I can afford. I will continue to send folks their way and will trust them with this car and any car I get in the future.

I originally posted this review under the wrong business name, back in 2011... Here's that original review:  Dr. Jenni is amazing. Her staff is warm and friendly, and the whole office is run very efficiently.  I would characterize this chiropractor as a very "low pressure" doctor. If you've ever been to a chiropractor that tries to tell you that everyone needs a lifetime of adjustments (before they've even looked at your x-rays--or even worse, doesn't take x-rays at all) then you know how awesome her approach is.  She knows everyone is different with different needs. You won't be a number or a wallet at AmFam. The staff knew me by my second visit and the doctor was asking about non-essential personal stuff ("how's your sick cat," "did you get the promotion?") with each patient.  I have gotten two therapeutic massages and both technicians were strong, communicative, and responsive.  Dr. Jenni took x-rays of my neck (it had been giving me some grief) and an old break in my arm. We talked through things I could do at home if my schedule (or insurance benefits) wouldn't accommodate follow up visits.   She is also a doctor that supports nutrition and supplements--which is HUGE in my book.   You can't go wrong here, and even though I am TERRIBLE about making regular appointments at ANY doctor, I will make sure to get back to this one as needed.

I wish I could give 2.5 stars here.   The good news: Open late.  The less good news: I called first to ask if they could do a pedi at 6:30 (they close at 7). They said yes... so my pedicure shouldn't have felt as rushed as it did. I was not the last client in the place, and it really bugs me when businesses say yes to late service (I know it's half my bad for not making it over sooner) but then rush you out the door. The technician said she did two coats and a top coat, but those were the fastest two coats ever. If you want an express pedi at "classic" pedi prices, this is the place for you.  I was also bugged that I had to pay $10 extra for "callous removal" but the alternative was a few disinterested circles with a worn down pumice. I don't have callouses... but I'd like a bit of attention paid to the rough spots!   I feel like I'm bordering on a "back in my day" moment... but sheesh, it used to be that when you paid for a standard pedicure, it took nearly an hour and your feet looked great afterward. Now, you have to pay extra for every little thing that used to come standard. Am I just a cranky old lady?

I love getting breakfast here. Love the chorizo wrap, the cinnamon roll pancakes, the power bowls, and the DD style Benedict. You can't go wrong, is what I'm saying... Unless you show up after 9:30 on a weekend, then be prepared to wait.

The food tasted great. I got a shrimp Poboy with slaw (minor point--put the slaw in a boat side dish so it doesn't soak the bread, guys!) My date had the blackened fish sandwich (it was Mahi) and cheesy grits.   The beer list isn't amazing, or I'd go 5 stars, but it was okay... And the happy hour specials ($4 pints and $6 for a boatload of wings) are great. We didn't stay for dessert, but the offerings were standard/yummy-sounding.   Service is weird here: be prepared for a different person each step of the way. I hope they split tips evenly.

Tokyo Joes is very good for fast food sushi. (It is not very good for sit down table service, $75 bottles of sake sushi.)  The bowls are well-portioned, the bento box is a tasty lunch and the rolls are fresh, if a little gimmicky.   I like that there are several lower calorie/ "healthy" options (I'm a fan of the Resolution Bowl and the seasonal Ichigo salad looks killer).
