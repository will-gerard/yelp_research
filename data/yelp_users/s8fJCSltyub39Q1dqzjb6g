Let's start with positives...  - Large and open entrance (way better than Gammage, which is a never ending hallway)  - Intimate stage/seating  - Helpful/sweet/attentive staff  - Bathrooms - they were clean, well lit, well decorated, and smelled good :}   Negatives...  - Naked statues in front of the theater - don't get me wrong, I'm all about art being an expression of beauty and the human body being beautiful, but I also appreciate artistic traits: class, taste and reverence...none of which were present in front of this theater.  - Concessions, a dumpy little espresso kiosk? LAME...   I'd like to come and see another show here to give the theater another shot, because honestly, the show I saw (which I refuse to name/advertise) was poorly written, boring and the acting was the worst I have seen in a very long time...

I have taken a ride on the light rail a few times now and I have some stories!! The first time I rode the light rail I took it from Mill Ave to Phoenix to see the D-Backs and Cubs play. My friends had caught a tram in Mesa so I sat there and watched a few trams come and go before I got onto the one with my friends on it. That was easy enough...there was enough room for me and the ride was smooth and fun (though I can't say it was relaxing)...Any ways. After the game was quite an experience! The tram ride home was a little more crowed now that the game had let out. There were two die hard fans in our car from the two teams who started talking trash to each other...well one of them had a little too much to drink and one thing lead to another and they were soon yelling threats at each other. Right before the drunker one took a swing (in a very crowded car) an older man stood up and shut them both up before someone got hurt...the tension in the air was thick the whole way back to Tempe where the Cub fan got off and punched the window. The friends of the other guy had to hold him back...I mean come on!!   Okay, then I had the pleasure of using the light rail to go to the Circus. Again I was headed to Phoenix but this time I got on at the Washington stop. It was again a fun ride, but I couldn't say that it was a relaxing ride...there was this bum who was asking people for money and I think it would be better with some music playing in the background...any ways the ride home wasn't as eventful as the baseball game crowd, but again, there was another bum asking for money...can people just ride in peace?  I like the light rail - I really do...it's always an interesting experience, but I just don't feel safe on it. I used to take the metro bus from Gilbert to Mesa every day for a while and I felt safer on that then I do on the light rail and the bums who ride the bus don't ask me for money either.

So when I first wakled into MacAlpine's {the restaurant part} I felt like I was walking into the 1955 diner from Back to the Future. Very awesome soda bar, with about every flavor of soda known to man. I quickly ordered a strawberry-banana soda and looked at the menu. For the most part it's a very simple menu, they obviously don't have fryers so the sides are kind of lame {bagged potato chips, really?} but I was not disappointed in the hamburger I got! Mmmmmmm! So delicious! Real cheese, a nice meaty taste and the bun seriously melted in my mouth - dare I say freshly baked?   Now for the dessert! We got the turtle sundae and it was amazing!! The portion size will not disappoint, and the ice cream had the perfect texture and consistency.   Really loved my first visit to MacAlpine's and I will definitely be going back for round two and three and four and...

I haven't experienced such friendly and good service in such a long time. Our waitress smiled at me and was up beat the whole time (I just don't see that genuine attitude any more) in addition to great service, the breakfast I had was delicious. I had their oatmeal and a side of seasoned fruit. The oatmeal was hearty and I love that my waitress brought me a whole dish of brown sugar (ohhh yee-a). The fruit was sub-par. I got two little pieces of pineapple, and the cantaloupe and honey-due were crunchy. But I'm not too concerned about it, I ate all the fruit and this place is a deli, not a fruit hut. I'm going to come again and branch out to something new - they had a lot of good things on their menu.   Love this place!

Okay, this was my first time at Phoenix Greyhound Park and my first time watching dog races (unless I can count watching All Dogs Go to Heaven - because I have seen that countless times). Any ways, I would definitely go again and I would totally recommend Phoenix Greyhound Park.   Like I said, I have never done this before - so I had no clue how to bet or what to bet on. There was this VERY helpful man named Chuck who broke down the beats to me and my friend and really helped us get started. I won 5 times, but still walked away $6 short from when I started...it takes real skill to be that good... :o) At first, since I didn't really know what I was doing, the races were a little confusing to me, but after 4 hours and a few wins later, I was yelling my dismay and excitement with the rest of the crowd! At about 10pm (when my friend and I assumed the old folks home buses came and packed up their clientele) The atmosphere was still lively and it was still fun! Though, I would say that's because 99% of the people who were there were probably also pure blood Hockey and Nascar fans...so they know how to have fun (in their own way! :))   To say the least I had a blast with the betting, dog races and family friendly environment - the reason for my mid-rating has more to do with the quality of food service. I think we saw our waitress about 4 times the whole 5 hours we were there...when the food finally came it was really good (don't waste your money on the desserts), but I was thirsty pretty much the whole time. I'm giving them a little bit of a break because I think for the whole room (200 tables) they only had 2 waitresses, so they were spread thin and we were up and down making our bets any ways.   Oh, and by the way, when you go, be a big spender and pay the $3 bucks a person and go up stairs, that's where all the fun is (and you get to ride the escalator)!

Yum! I mostly go to NFC for a concrete (which is their frozen custard). I love the creamy vanilla custard with cookies and cream mix-in. This is a cute little shop with a 50s diner feel. I have never had bad service and the place stays really clean.

I think Cold Stone is overrated. The ice cream melts way to fast and gets all soupy, the Cold Stone employees never mix the ingredients very well and I always walk away thinking, "...really? Did I just do that to myself again?"   This location in particular is never clean, the bathrooms are a bit scary and they don't sing when you tip them. If you're in the area and you're looking for a cold treat skip on over to Fatburger (just next door) and get their chocolate shake!

I ordered the bagel breakfast, which sounded great, but beware! The breakfast consists of a huge warmed bagel, a fried egg, slice of cheese, and a sausage link cut in half. I only got the taste of sausage in the last quarter of my meal...and the bagel started to crumble after my second bite. We went early enough so there wasn't a lot of people there, but as tables left, they sat dirty and our table felt gross when we sat down.   I needed to give this place a try, but I've done my due-diligence and I don't feel the need to ever return.

I came here for an early dinner with a friend and it was a night and day difference from my earlier lunch dining experience at OC. We got there before the dinner rush and got a great booth. Our waitress was attentive and helpful. Our meal was good, a hamburger with great flavor and the house salad was good. For dessert we got the Molten Chocolate Cake...Oh my goodness!! It was so GOOD! If you go to Chili's make sure to leave room for this dessert!! The chocolate cake was sweet, moist and warm, the ice cream had a soft chocolate shell and complimented the warmth of the cake with a cool creamy ending.   I might just come back for the dessert. Enjoy!

Love this place for a few reasons:  1. They don't skimp on the good stuff. You want a medium? You GET it and then some.   2. Rootbeer floats. By far the best bang for your buck, you get to pick your flavor and then you get to enjoy it with your favorite fizz.  3. Price. Go on Monday nights because they do a 'happy hour' type deal on their toppings.   FYI they are a cash only place, so keep that in mind before you go and it's a small space so if you have a group of more than 4, expect a tight squeeze.

This Wal-Mart can be summed up in one word: Dirty. This has to be the oldest Wal-Mart in the Mesa/Phoenix area and you can tell before you even step foot into the store! For starters, the parking lot looks like a 'stop-n-swap' meet where everyone brings their junk and sets it up in the back of their cars. There is trash everywhere and everything is rundown. Then you go into the store and the flooring is old and gross, the lighting is bad and it has a weird smell.   If you happen to need something and you can't find another store near by, this Wal-Mart still has great Wal-Mart prices and the people working and shopping there are really nice. BUT! Do not use their self checkouts!! You have been warned! Here's what happened to me:   I scanned two items that I kept in the cart so I pushed that "I do not want to bag this item" twice, the scanner was having a really hard time picking up the bar codes so I had to very slowly repeat my waiving motion over the lasers. Any ways, I get to my next item and it's super light so when I put it in the bag it was like "would you like to bag this item" and since it wasn't picking it up, I just hit the "I do not want to bag this item" button again. Well...that was the 3rd item I didn't want to bag so it triggered an alert and I needed a 'Store log in" The attendant was helping someone else so I sat there...and sat...until the guy came and fixed it for me. Then I got to scan my next item (super glue) - I guess super glue is a controlled item because, again, I needed an override. Okay, I finish up checking out and request $100 back...bad idea I come to find out - the machine only gives me half the change in $10s, but it's still making noises like it's trying to get money out to me. I call my helper over and he kicks the machine and it shoots out two $5s...the thing sounds like it's dying...so my helper calls over to a coworker, who comes over and says "Well you've got to kick it, did you kick it yet" So apparently this happens a lot. I think at the thought of being kicked again the machine spits out the rest of my change in $5s, in a mad panic and falls silent.   What an experience.

Ugh, I feel so bad. Me and this Filiberto's location used to have a good thing going on, but something has changed. For the worse. The only thing I can imagine is they have changed their bean supplier. Ever since September 2014 when I order my usual bean and cheese burrito, half the time the beans aren't cooked all the way so you get grey-ish-slop colored beans, with a dry or sandy texture, and an old-water taste. Or you get what I got last night, which were runny, grey-ish-slop that tasted more like day old oatmeal with a hint of rubber. It's so gross.   Please fix your beans and call me! Otherwise, you have lost a devoted customer.

If you like Steve's Krazy Sub you will like Ned's Krazy Sub. They are brothers and have the same set up. Though I would like to comment on this location's bathroom! It's the basic single bathroom you would expect, but man does it smell good!! I walked in and was pleasantly surprised, I definitely enjoyed my experience there!

Nello's you never do me wrong. Your pizza is tasty, your Italian Beef is delicious, your appetizers are on target; I only wish I could say something about dessert, but I'm always too full to try!   Maybe next time!

Where do I start? I've been to this Old Chicago once before but I don't remember my visit being so horrible. I wish I could say that it was an isolated event that tarnished my outlook, but unfortunately this whole trip sucked.   I arrive and had to go to the bathroom, but we had to be somewhere after lunch so I decided to wait to get my drinks and food ordered before I use the facilities. I get seated with my party and we wait a few minutes and the waitress comes along and orders all of our drinks. We browse the menu and wait...and wait...and finally our drinks come and she leaves again...so, I still have go to the bathroom but I wanted to order first (I figured she'd be right back) but we wait...and wait...then she comes back and finally takes our order. I run to the bathroom and - ew gross! I try to hold my breath and start to breath through my nose (I heard that your nose was a natural filter) the whole place was grimmy and sticky and trashy - I get back to my seat and enjoy my group of friends while we wait for our food. Funny thing is...we kept waiting...and waiting...almost 30 minutes go by and out come our salads.   Then 20 minutes go by again and out come our entrees, well except mine. I sit back thinking that when the waitress left, she left to get the rest of our food...but a minute goes by and I ask some other chick (thank goodness we were next to the kitchen door) if they were gonna bring me my food, and my waitress over heard me and she popped out of nowhere and was like "oh, and what did you order?"...really? I told her and she comes back in 2 seconds with my food.   I had the buffalo chicken hoagie, the 'toasted' hoagie was dry and stale, the chicken was dry and beside the buffalo sauce it really had no 'wow' affect, I was actually very disappointed. The house salad I got was really good though. I liked the roasted almonds - they were semisweet and really added something special to an otherwise boring typical salad.   Side note: a friend of mine also had to use the bathrooms, and the stall she chose didn't have any seat covers and she said the seat was sticky...sick-o-dear.  Really OC?? Do you only clean your place bimonthly or something? It was so bad, if this is how you care for your restrooms, I'd hate to see the kitchen!!   I would give this place 1 start, but our waitress (although slower than molasses in the winter) was really nice and other people in my group enjoyed their food (namely their pizza).

What an experience! The Mesa Auction last night was so much fun! I have never been to an auction so I can't compare it to anything (except what I've seen on the BBC channel) so the only thing I would have to say was that it was warmer then would have expected but that just added to the experience.   If you want killer deals then make a trip out, there was this entire dinning set (table, chairs and sideboard) that sold for $10 and a HUGE sectional with a hide-a-bed and reclining seats that sold for $525!! There was a high-end Baldwin piano that sold for $900 and beautiful china cabinets with matching table and chairs...this place is awesome!! The auctions are sorted into 4 different rooms two inside and two outside. The items get better in quality as they move from outside to inside, back to outside and then to the last inside room which carried some big ticket furniture and appliances.  There is a $50 refundable deposit on a bidding stick (which you need in order to participate in all the fun) and let me tell you it can get intense!! It's a great date idea and good fun for any one.

I have been with Cox for 8 years and would never recommend them to any one unless they absolutely must have a cable connection - Cox is the worse in customer service, they jack up their prices because they are the ONLY cable company in the valley and they recently have had outages for unexplained reasons.   Last month's outage lasted 3 days - THREE DAYS! And when you called to find out what was wrong you would get a "sorry we are experiencing higher than normal call volumes and will be unable to answer your call." *click* {-- the sound of Cox's automated message hanging up on you.  Avoid at all costs if you can. There is no redeeming quality at this time that makes them worth the horrible customer service and intermittent service.

Yum! Temari does sushi right! They have other items on their menu, but I've only had their sushi. The flavors in each roll are so unique, we ordered 3 rolls: spicy tuna, lollipop roll and their version of a volcano roll.   We have never tasted anything as good as these rolls. Very fresh fish, amazing taste, and the service was very nice too.  The place is pretty small, so expect a tight squeeze, but definitely worth while.

Livestock. Yes, livestock. This weekend I bought livestock from Aden's Hay Oasis. I started small - getting 4 chicks, but I will soon expand my livestock ownership to goats in the next few weeks. Aden didn't carry goats, but they had food, cages, and accessories for ALL kinds of livestock, from goats and sheep, to dairy cows and show horses.   I was able to pick out my chicks and get all the essentials from Aden's. The two guys working the shop were less than helpful...they definitely seemed detached and they were a little slow checking me out. But when I asked them a direct question, they knew what they were talking about and helped me out.  If you're coming from far away, call first to make sure they have what you need...because it's a long drive only to find out they are out of something!

I know this is an old bowling location, but I always have so much fun when I'm here! Bowling is a fun event for all ages and what's great about this location is how clean it is! Bathrooms are amazing, lanes are maintained, and sitting areas are clean too.   If you aren't familiar with bowling alleys, then I'm going to give you a heads up - you don't got there for the food. I mean it's about the same quality as Domino's Pizza just to give you an idea.  Smoke-free environment means I can walk out of this place with clear eyes and breathing great. Come and have some fun next time you feel the need to roll some balls down a lane or two.

I was not impressed with the sandwich I got from here. The drive-thru lady was snippy when I asked questions about the sandwiches. When I ordered what I thought was a hot Turkey sandwich with guac, swiss, and lettuce...no, that would be too easy. My sandwich had onions, tomatoes, and bacon on it. After taking off the offending extras (I had since driven off and on the freeway), the sandwich was disappointing. Soggy, falling apart and flavorless. I have definitely experienced better.

In celebration of National Hot Dog Day, Thomas and I made a special trip to Ted's. I have never been there and I am now sad that I have been missing such a GREAT spot!   I shouldn't go much further without stating that I do not like hot dogs. But when I finished my dog, I was contemplating getting another one. I got the 'all beef' with mustard, cheese sauce, chili, and onions and cheese fries. I wish I would've skipped the fries, I would have definitely been able to get another dog down.  The cheese sauce isn't worth the extra $.60 on the dog or the fries- you'll be much better off just skipping it.

I feel like I'm getting away with something...how is it I can get so much and pay so little? I cancelled my membership at Yoga Deva (see my review) and started at Lifetime. I LOVED Yoga Deva - Shosh was amazing! But I just felt like I need to lift weights and get into the habit of running again. I can only afford one membership and since Lifetime offers Yoga too...Deva had to go :(   I love Lifetime. It's as simple as that. I got the most basic membership (because I'm a simple person) and I still feel like I have more than enough services to meet my physical needs. If only they made men like this....   I am definitely a fan of Lifetime!!

If you are hungry and you want to get what you pay for...don't stop here. This is one of the only Chipotles where I get the stink-eye if I ask for a little more rice/beans/meat (not that I'm asking for mounds of food, but at least enough to fill my burrito) The burritos here are way to small to be paying almost $8 bucks for a burrito (I don't usually get extras like a drink or chips).

My company is into giving back to the community, so they invited my department to volunteer at St. Mary's during work-hours this week. It was a great experience and I would do it again! We filled boxes that get passed out to families in need. It makes me feel so good to volunteer and help others. And I feel so lucky to work for a company that supports and encourages this kind of service!   St. Mary's was the first Food Bank in the world, they have expanded into a national effort. I also learned that 1 in 5 children wake-up and go to sleep hungry, 1 in 7 adults (18-64) have to decide between eating or buying things like gas/rent/bills/etc, and 1 in 12 seniors (64+) are struggling with bills/medical needs/food.  Help someone else and make yourself feel great - volunteer!!

I've been looking for antique china cabinets, side boards and bookshelves for my front room; and I have a general idea of the look I'm going for. This is the first genuine antique store I have been too and...wow! this place is huge!   The main store has a full basement underneath the first floor and both are filled wall to wall with 100s of displays. There is also an annex to the west of the main store which has an over flow of items. Both of the buildings are run down. The main store reminds me of a large dance hall, it has a big, open staircase leading down to the basement just to the left of the front door. From the basement there are two staircases going back up to the first floor, one on the east side and the other on the west side of the building. Both buildings were well light and the pathways (I say pathways, not aisles for a reason) were clean and easy to walk through.   Along with my friend, I brought my two puppies and they had no problem letting me walk around with my animals - animal friendly is always a plus!! Both stores were a bit disorganized and my OCD sensors were on overdrive, but I think most of the merchandise is still owed by individuals...so all their stuff is in the same booth area. I'm sure Antique Plaza gets a percentage of the sales. Oh and I would like to mention that Antique Plaza was like the only store open on Labor Day (which was when I visited the stores).   Walking through the different booths and looking at some of the pieces brought back memories of my childhood, events, good times and at times I had moments of awe for some unique beauties that were displayed.   I didn't find what I was looking for, but I had a really fun time exploring what some call treasures and some call junk...check it out if you are in the neighborhood, who knows? You may find something you haven't thought about in a really long time.   Yay for good memories!! And yay I'm a fan of Antique Plaza!

This cute, locally owned sub shop is a great place to get a tasty sub. I have gone to this location a few times and it is aways clean and well cared for. Your sandwich is always served with a pickle spear and they have lunch and dinner specials.   They support local softball leagues and the ASU Sun Devils. So there are pictures of all the teams they sponsor and of course, you can purchase a Krazy t-shirt with the ASU colors and fun sayings. All the locations I have been to, are just as pleasant, but this is the only one where I met the owner as he was working there. He was really nice and I enjoy the food/atmosphere even more now.  Try it out, you'll like it.

Let's start with the positives because I do actually think there were a few...  The food wasn't bad, I ordered the Ham and Cheese omelet and I wish the ham was in thinner pieces and the potatoes were too soft and mushy - I really liked the french toast and they had HOT syrup and it was so good! You get great portions to what you pay for, so make sure you're hungry.  Negatives...  I think this place should be renamed "Angry Aunt Betty's Kitchen" I wouldn't say the waitresses were 'mean' but the environment was angry; it had no purpose, no identity, no "grandma's kitchen" feel.   To be honest Grandma's Kitchen felt like a re-purposed coffee house...and since I've lived in this area for a while, I know it WAS a  coffee house. I'm not overly impressed with the service and since they don't have that to fall back onto, I will go to a number of other places - sorry Grandma, you just ain't cuttin' it!

I like Italian food. It's probably the only food I will take home, because the left overs are usually just as good the next day!  It's kinda sad that Alessia's is SO good that I don't even have left overs! We started off with bread and this amazing vinaigrette/oil combo. It was the best mixture I've ever had. For dinner, I had fettuccine with a homemade white sauce that was so creamy and filled with flavor, I couldn't believe it. The chicken I added was crisp and the spices used on the chicken complimented the white sauce nicely.  Side note: the owner (who served us) is a bit of a pompous...I'm thinking it has to do with the pride he has with his food/cultural differences...but still, brace yourself if he's there when you go otherwise he might ruin the food experience by his attitude.  Come, enjoy, and get fat! :}

I am a new fan of sushi, in general. So read this review with the understanding that I have limited experience in the sushi realm.   I loved this place! You are definitely not paying for the ambiance, but I think that actually makes it a better place to go, because the focus is the food, not the location. We arrived shortly after happy hour ended, but with a few pleas and smiles, we were given happy hour rates (with a reminder that next time we would need to pay full price if we were late again). I absolutely love that kind of customer service - especially when I'm the benefactor.  We ordered the Viva Las Vegas, Rainbow, a Hawaiian special, and an other eel roll that I didn't try. We ordered 6 rolls for 4 people and we were all well fed by the end of our dinner.   Our waitress was MIA for most of the night. We finally had to hail down another waitress and request our check. Still...I'm definitely a fan of Sushi Kee's delicious sushi rolls and look forward to my next trip.

I went here to watch the boxing match between Mayflower and Marquez. The food was good, we sampled 4 different favors of wings and they all had a great taste and texture. Our service was great and the place was packed - though we got there super early and had great seats in a booth. The manager came to our booth during one of the preliminary fights and told us that since we were in a booth they were going to move people to sit with us (she said something about it's a requirement to have 4 people to a booth during these kind of events). I was a little annoyed, but if that's policy then I didn't mind so much - plus it would have been cool to meet some new people. However, people never came. I don't know if there just wasn't as many people as the manager had expected, or the groups were big and didn't want to lose two people to come sit with us. Either way we ended up having our own booth the whole time, which we preferred anyways.   The fun for the crowd really started during the main event, there were whoops and yells and cries of defeat or success. Super fun - and what really topped off my experience was the bathroom! Clean, roomy with a sitting couch and cute mirrors all over the place. It smelled good too.  I would definitely come to a Buffalo Wild Wings for a big event like this any time!

Breakfast, dinner, it doesn't matter what time you go, the Hangar Cafe is delicious. They have to put something special in their hash browns to make them taste so AMAZING. It takes a little long to get the food, but you know it's fresh because they cook it right in front of you.

I came here a few days ago with my team from work. Since it was considered a work sponsored lunch we did not partake in the main attaction - home brewed beer - but we did enjoy Four Peaks fabulous menu! I had the French Dip and their beer battered fries. The meat was a little tough but the au jus added GREAT flavor and the bread had the best texture. Hmmm...for dessert we all split the ice cream cake. WOW was that cake good, and BIG! Definitely worth the $5 it cost.

Okay, I went here for breakfast this morning. The food is great, the eggs had a great texture, their made-to-order hash browns were cooked perfectly with just a little crunch and their waffles were light and tasted great with the fresh strawberries and whip cream we got on the side.   When I walk into a place like Harlow's two things cross my mind, (1) old which leads to, (2) dirty bathrooms. I rode my bike so I had to go into the bathroom to wash my hands. I braced myself as I expected the worse, but a pleasant surprise was awaiting me! This bathroom experience was awesome! The room was clean, had mirrors on opposite sides which enlarged the space and beautiful wallpaper and porcine tiles.   Great food, great bathroom, and great service. My top pick for breakfast joints!

So I ventured to give this location a second try after my first experience almost sent me to heaven in a pizza box! The service was great even the second time around! It took my boyfriend and I almost 20 minutes to order because we were trying to get something different that we both wanted to eat. Our waitress was so relaxed and willing to help, she finally took pity on us and suggested two dishes - which we jumped on.  The Big Rig Pasta was SO YUMMY! A+ for her first suggestion...though I wish I could say the same for her other suggestion. The stuffed mushrooms which was her second suggestion were "eh." I'm not going to hold it against her though because she was just trying to help us. The mushrooms weren't that great, I think it had more to do with the sausage which the mushrooms were stuffed with and the overall texture of all the ingredients, just didn't do it for us. But I'd like to mention that even though these mushrooms were a bit gross, they were still 100% better than anything I ate at Avalon in Scottsdale. I'd rather eat stuffed mushrooms for the rest of my life then eat another dish at Avalon.  I am so bummbed though because even though I only took  a few bites of the mushrooms, I basically stuffed my face with the Big Rig dish and so at the end I was so full I couldn't eat their one dessert - which is what I wanted to order first but my boyfriend wouldn't let me until I had "real food" first. Ugh, next time dessert is #1 for this chic! :)

Man, what a sandwich. I called in my order (for the Dilly Club - no tomato) and it was ready when I picked it up. In addition to my sandwich I ordered a couple of their Valentine's Day sugar cookies because a portion of the proceeds when to the Phoenix Children's Hospital - which made me feel good :}  the sandwich was flavorful and VERY filling, the cookies were awesome - though I got kinda sick after eating one because they were huge! and very rich.

I really like the lay out of the Gammage theater. The theater has a very intimate feeling and I always feel cozy wherever I sit. You can tell that the Gammage is no spring chicken however...it could use a face lift in a few areas like: carpeting and seating. During the intermission me and my friend were able to walk around and look at all the merchandise, the facilities were clean and - again cozy. The ushers were nice and I really enjoy my experiences there.

Where do I start. Okay, I love this QuikTrip - how's that for starters. The employees here are SO friendly and while I can honestly say that every QuikTrip I have been to is friendly, this one beats them all. Employees get my door, wish me a great day and they always say "see ya again soon!" I walk in and feel like I have friends - oh and another thing, they are super quick checking people out and multitasking. Plus their gas is either the cheapest or close enough to pay a little extra for the quality of people. I love knowing my money is going towards such friendly people.

Wow, I am SO glad Cookies by Design has a location here in the valley!! When I was in WA a guy I knew would always send these incredible cookie bouquets to his wife and kids when he was away on business. These cookies tasted AMAZING! Today I was in a bind for gift ideas and I called up my friend to see what company he used. This is the one, the cookies taste SO good and he said only go with a delivery company that is local (good call!). Cookies by Design is local, I was able to call them with my questions and they were VERY friendly, order online, and there was even a coupon (when I google'd it) - I will definitely use them again and I would recommend them to any one who needs to send a gift to a local pal :}

I love this baseball park. Last year I was a season ticket holder and before that I had come to baseball games pretty consistently, even by myself a few times. But this field is great, not just for baseball. I have seen two motor cross events there and a monster truck thing. It doesn't matter where you sit, you can see, hear and enjoy yourself! Of course...I have to admit the lower level seats behind home plate are AWESOME! The firework show they put on after some Friday night games is pretty fun, about a month ago they had a Michael Jackson tribute fireworks show and that was great!   This is a great park to just go and enjoy an event with family, friends, or alone :D I've witnessed a few fan fights, I've seen some amazing plays, and of course I always have a great time!!

Get ready for an experience of a lifetime. Before even trying Los Dos Molinos, I knew my exposure to Mexican cuisine was missing something truly spectacular. It wasn't until I had the opportunity to try Molinos, that I knew my intuition to be correct. This location draws you in even before you order. The décor and layout is unique. Outdoor seating provides private dining in an open space. Indoor décor draws you into Mexican heritage that gets so Americanized at other restaurants.   When it comes time to order you have had your fill of the best tortilla chips and salsa your tongue could ask for. The salsa fills your mouth with multiple flavors of tomato, peppers, onion and a hint of lingering spice. The tortillas are obviously fresh, crisp and compliment the salsa perfectly.  Get ready for flavor in whatever you order. The majority of their dishes favor spice, but the waiter will give some recommendations to those with weaker stomachs. I LOVE their chimichangas with red sauce. The chicken is moist and the deep fried tortilla is flakey and delicious. Serving sizes are enough for two people, but I rarely share. Los Dos Molinos offers a typical Mexican dessert, sopapillas but I'm usually too stuffed to participate.   This has now become the only true Mexican food I will eat. I recommend it to all my friends who visit from other states, or who live here and have a hankering for something truly authentic and full of flavor.

If first impressions could kill...   Glenn and Bri D. accompanied a friend and I to Compass Restaurant. After stepping off the fun (and I mean fun!) elevator ride up to the restaurant I instantly felt dizzy - everyone got a laugh when I instinctively asked 'why do I feel weird' - Um, the room is moving. The unease got better when we moved from the core (non-moving) of the building to the seating (the actual rotating floor).   The service was SO good. Our waitress was super nice and attentive to a level I'm not really used too, but I could get used to it! We ordered the prime rib and she came back so apologetic that she even let us order it, that she gave us two filet mignon dishes - which were really good. I got the mac n' cheese as my side dish, which had a sweetness to it - a unique taste, but not appealing to me.   The dessert was disappointing. Strawberry shortcake seems like an easy-to-please/hard-to-mess-up kind of dish...I guess I was wrong. The shortcake was dry and had no flavor, the tiny shot of whip cream was the best thing about it, but it was only the size of a silver dollar...sad day.   I have definitely experienced better food for less. The service was outstanding, but didn't make up for the lackluster in the food and ambiance.  By the way, I got even sicker on the way out and that stuck with me all night, making it hard to go to sleep :( No bueno...

This place is huge, I wouldn't want to be there if a natural disaster struck - no one would be able to find an exit! I went yesterday to get hardware for my bed (which they give you for free!) and I used the bathroom...has anyone used their bathrooms lately? They have the COOLEST hand dryers!! I washed my hands twice...just so I could dry them again...Yes, I know: weird. But you have to try out the Ikea bathrooms if you are in the neighborhood!   These are by far the best hand dryers I have ever used! Kudos to Ikea for their innovation and inspiring (yet cheap) furniture! Oh and their free hardware. :)

Ugh, I would really like to like this place.   Getting to the location is awful, traffic is painfully slow since there are no left turn signals on the main street. Parking was okay since it was Saturday afternoon, but having to re-park every two hours kinda sucked and the food was bland!! I have been to Germany, and all the dishes I had there were flavorful, and yummy...but this place? bland and embarrassing.   I met a group there to play board games and the staff was so nice and great! But the turkey sandwich with horseradish mayo was dry and gross. I ordered it thinking the mayo would throw me off but "hey, it's a German restaurant, let's give it a whirl" I couldn't even taste the special mayo! My homemade sandwiches have more flavor than this one.   I ordered the apple strudel hopeful for some redeeming quality to compliment the great service...0-2, again like the Compass Restaurant, the best thing about the dessert was the sliver dollar shot of whip cream.   This place was so accommodating and fun to hang out at, with really nice service...but I wish I could have something nice to say about the food.

Gabi you are so awesome! G- spot pleasure is exactly what this place exemplifies!  Let's start with the basics: 1. Creamy deliciousness in every bite! 2. Great service! 3. Comfortable and relaxing environment! 4. Open late!  With these and much more, no one can go wrong or get lost in this G-spot experience! I had the chocolate hazel nut, and I can't wait to come back and try what else they have to offer.

I've been to Sun Asian before, but that was pre-Yelp. So I was excited to go home and share this experience with all my Yelp friends.   We get to the restaurant just after 11am - it's dead, if the TVs weren't on I could have heard chirping. We got seated, the hostes was very nice and took our order right away. Not even 2 minutes had passed when she brought out our meal...wow, what service. I orderd the Orange Chicken and enjoyed the texture and taste. The chicken meat was tender and the batter was crisp.   Enjoyed my meal and would come again!

Einstein has an interesting way of taking your order - instead of standing in line, making your order, paying for it, then waiting for your food to enjoy. They add another step: between making your order and paying for it, they make you wait again. Personally, I'm a 4 step kinda girl, so that extra 5th step throws me off a little.   Every bagel I have ever tried here has been delicious! I wouldn't recommend the Bagel Poppers, after about 3 of them you start to feel like a damp sponge that has be left outside on a very humid day...not good. Don't get their hot chocolate unless you like the super sweet milky tasting coco - I prefer a stronger/bitter chocolate.  This location is always packed, but I have never had bad service - and I am a fan!

I'd like to begin this review with a warning...WARNING: Oscar the Grouch works at this location!   I pull up to the drive-thru at 5am this morning to order a drink for me and my friend. Little miss Grouchy gets on the other end full of attitude and scorn. She asks for my order and interrupts me as I am in the middle of my statement saying "is that all?" with a snappy tone. Which completely throws me off, I finish my order but can't believe her tone the whole time she is talking with me. I drive around to the window and she got my drink wrong! (maybe she should have LISTENED to the whole thing...any ways I hand back my drink so she can make another one and she slams the drink into the trash and refuses to look at me. She maintains a permanent scorn on her face and when she finally hands me my corrected drink, I say, "thanks, have a good morning." she slams the window on me! I don't have the highest expectations for any drive-thru, but Starbucks always promotes their friendly service and my experiences at other Starbucks have always been pleasent; so I am shocked this Starbucks is still open. When those 100 odd stores closed a few years ago, this one should have been one of them.  This isn't the first time I have come to this location and had to correct my order at the window, in fact getting my order RIGHT is an exception! I can't believe a company like Starbucks would have stand for such low quality in service.

I made it! Haha, barely. If you are new to hiking I definitely recommend North Mountain. It's a great place to start - I took my dog with me (not sure if that's allowed) but he and I both needed gradual climb to get us started.

**I'm posting this again, because I guess I posted the first one to the wrong light rail?**  I have taken a ride on the light rail a few times now and I have some stories!! The first time I rode the light rail I took it from Mill Ave to Phoenix to see the D-Backs and Cubs play. My friends had caught a tram in Mesa so I sat there and watched a few trams come and go before I got onto the one with my friends on it. That was easy enough...there was enough room for me and the ride was smooth and fun (though I can't say it was relaxing)...Any ways. After the game was quite an experience! The tram ride home was a little more crowed now that the game had let out. There were two die hard fans in our car from the two teams who started talking trash to each other...well one of them had a little too much to drink and one thing lead to another and they were soon yelling threats at each other. Right before the drunker one took a swing (in a very crowded car) an older man stood up and shut them both up before someone got hurt...the tension in the air was thick the whole way back to Tempe where the Cub fan got off and punched the window. The friends of the other guy had to hold him back...I mean come on!!   Okay, then I had the pleasure of using the light rail to go to the Circus. Again I was headed to Phoenix but this time I got on at the Washington stop. It was again a fun ride, but I couldn't say that it was a relaxing ride...there was this bum who was asking people for money and I think it would be better with some music playing in the background...any ways the ride home wasn't as eventful as the baseball game crowd, but again, there was another bum asking for money...can people just ride in peace?  I like the light rail - I really do...it's always an interesting experience, but I just don't feel safe on it. I used to take the metro bus from Gilbert to Mesa every day for a while and I felt safer on that then I do on the light rail and the bums who ride the bus don't ask me for money either.

I think what I like most of all about Sushi Ave is Harry and Nana. They have made my experiences so pleasant. Every time Travis and I go to Sushi Ave Nana makes us something special (from her secret menu) and it's ALWAYS delicious! She is working on a secret menu to offer on their Yelp page and I am so excited for it, because everything she gives us is AMAZING!  Their sushi rolls are full of flavor, never have they been soggy, the Vegas roll is SOO good!!! Warm, with a light crisp texture and eel sauce...mmmMmm!  Come, try it out, it really is as good as it gets!!

Mmmmm the burgers here are awesome! I ordered the fries, though I was too full after eating my burger and shake that I didn't have room for the fries. A note on the shakes: they are the best! You can tell they are made with real ice cream because the texture and taste are just right.  The location was a little dirtier than other locations I have been too in the valley, but the food was good and the music fun!

YUM! Probably the best cheese steak I've had in AZ. The meat melts in your mouth, the flavors (yes I've had them more than once) are distinct for each. Lately I've been craving more of the spicy sandwiches and if you talk to Marc he will hook you up! They have a special spicy sauce that really adds some kick.  Marc is the owner of Philly's and he is the nicest man! So willing to cook up anything delicious - and I really like that he tries out new things.   Give this place a try, I am definitely a fan.

So I am helping my boyfriend repaint his whole house. We go to this Home Depot and buy tons on paint, brushes and rollers - we spend like 45 minutes wondering around and when it comes time to check out there is no one around to check us out. There is a huge line of 10-15 people waiting to use the self checkout terminals with "please wait for assistance" being repeated at each one at least once. There is only one guy working the booth and he is dealing with a purchase.   The frustrating part is while we were wondering around the store earlier I saw about 4 or 5 employees just kicking it in the light department just talking it up; and even waiting in line there were about 2 or 3 employees just standing around watching the line. The least management could have done was open a register and speed up the check out line, even if they did it for just a few minutes it would have been a huge help!   The reason why this isn't getting the lowest rating is because the guy at the paint counter (the only guy at the paint counter) was very nice.

I've been to many Sally's locations and I really like the consistency of the stores. There are usually about three women working, two who blend in with the majority of customers and then one girl who is very...daring with her hair and makeup. No matter what store I go to, there is always this combination of employees - and for a Beauty Supply store, I love it! It gives the stores some spunk.  Whenever I go to this location, I get the help I need and the girls are always able to help me with my questions, no problem. I am a Sally's member so I get good deals and I am always satisfied with my purchases.

Mangos has a few things that make it as good as it gets! For starters, the food is phenomenal! It doesn't matter what you want, it will have flavor and incredible taste! Not just that, every time I come the waiter is attentive and genuine. During the cooler seasons they have fresh tamales available - first come first serve.   Heads up it's cash only - but worth a trip to the ATM if need be.

I wouldn't recommend this place to any one I like. What kind of restaurant serves salads and charges you for the dressing? I ordered the Symphany Sandwich and was charged an extra .75 for the lettuce, which I can kind of understand but even still, aren't they saving money since I'm not using their bread? Any ways, I let that slide. Then I pick up my food go outside to eat on their patio and I have no dressing...so thinking they made a mistake I go back in there and asked if dressing came with their salads and the girl was like, "Did you ask for dressing?" - Am I supposed to ask when I'm ordering a salad!? - so I said, "No, but I ordered a salad...it doesn't come with it?" "No that's extra, did you want to get some?" Yeah, I was done with this place from that moment on. For the amount of food I got coupled with the price and service...I would only send people I hated to this joint.   Totally sucks.

Oops I did it again...but this time I took pictures!  I still can't believe what they charge for a stinkin' sandwich, which isn't even that big or tasty! But that is not what brought my update from a 2 start to a 1 star...it was the bathroom!!  Oh my goodness! Someone call the maid I think something has died in here (a few times)! Take a look at my pictures, there is rust all over the trash can, a grimmy 'weathered' look over all the appliances and floor, and look at the walls!! It looked like a mixture of orange mold and years of soap scum caked on. The faucet was hard to work, and look at the grim and moldy caulking...grossness....Beware....BEWARE!!!

The only thing I will ever remember about this place is the icy customer service and the inflexible menu. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito since I'm a substitute kind of person and on the menu is said "absolutely NO substitutes!" - yikes! So instead of getting $9 out of me they only got $6. But lets talk about this bean and cheese burrito...I was under the impression that a bean and cheese burrito was basically - bean and cheese wrapped up in a warm tortilla and maybe some graded cheese on top.   Well, this was not the case! Half way through my burrito I came across shredded beef pieces! I'm not a vegetarian, but if I was I would have had a heart attack! The first thing that came to my mind was "absolutely NO substitutes!" - but does that mean only they can substitute? Or is the cook just going senile? Either way, I didn't like that. Not one bit. I didn't really even want the bean and cheese burrito, I really wanted the taco salad, but I couldn't ask for substitutes so I was forced to pick the plainest thing on the menu and they go and add stuff to it!   I did like that they left the water pitcher with us at the table...however, the table they gave us was the smallest table in the room. We barely had room for our plates and utensils, let-alone this big water jug. I felt cramped; and this was emphasized by the guy sitting behind me, because when he scooted his chair back a little bit - it nearly knocked me face first into my plate! Oh, and by the way, large groups: they "absolutely will NOT split checks" so this is not the best place to go Dutch.   I will end on a positive note: ....did I mention already that they left water for us to refill our glasses? Oh...I did. Well, I guess I ran out of positives - Sorry.

Oh the British. They are so nerdy, but this place is a great place to grab some delicious food! I love these old houses-turned restaurant; it makes for a cozy setting. I could even go as far as saying, you'd get a different feeling or experience every time you went, if you sat in a different spot (good stuff, not bad).   When I experienced R/C it was on a Saturday afternoon, and it was pretty disappointing to find they only had 2 servers and 2 or 3 kitchen staff. So basically they were slow to take our order, and then the food wait was about 30 minutes behind too. Luckily, Travis and I weren't in too much of a rush, but we did spend a lot of time there. I got their Turkey bacon sandwich with avocado and pesto mayo - OMG! It was amazing. Their wedge fries - also delicious!   I will definitely come back for seconds and hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

Wow! I am so impressed by UTL. This was my first 'tea party' and I loved it - I met up with Kym C. and Julie M. to discuss the book for our Book Club. UTL was very accommodating and had very friendly/helpful service. I ordered a small pot of the Almond and Vanilla Herbal Tea and a slice of their red velvet cake. Both were SO GOOD! The only experience I have had with tea is peppermint herbal tea that you get from the store, and to be honest I've never even finished any that I've made (just not my cup-o-tea I s'pose) but I loved my herbal tea from UTL and I will come back to try different varieties. It had the best flavor and came in a really cool tea pot. The red velvet cake was to die for. It was very rich, moist, and sweet. I loved it, though it was so rich, so moist, and so sweet that I couldn't finish it all in one sitting although, I sure tried...  I am half tempted to go back and buy myself their nifty tea pot and enjoy more of the herbal tea selections, but I don't know if I'm confident enough quite yet, I think I'm going to take one of their classes and then, maybe.   I wish our waitress was more attentive to us and I also wish the menus were all the same - Kym and I swapped our menus before we ordered because there were different selections of teas on each one, which I though was weird. They also don't really have a menu for their desserts (which I guess is okay since the desserts are in a glass display, but it would have been cool if they were listed somewhere).  But even with those downers I am definitely planning to come again, I loved the atmosphere and the relaxing vibe this place puts off. I am definitely a fan!!

My husband and I have been eating at this location for over a year. Every time we come in, we get great service. They have WONDERFUL oatmeal, but they don't serve it later than like 2pm I think or when it's gone it's gone for the day. So if they have it, give it a try. The chicken fried steak is also DELICIOUS. They have great steaks and I really love their chorizo scrambler.  To be honest, I have never been disappointed with anything we've ever ordered from Black Bear. They have good portion sizes, but watch out for their sundaes: they are HUGE and AMAZING {so save room if you are planning to have a sweet finish to your meal}.  I highly recommend Black Bear to anyone who loves some good 'ol comfort food.

This was the location for a Bridal Shower I attended. The service was great! Our waiter even split the check...what? 25 different ways - that was awesome! The space they put us in was cozy and well lit. My food tasted great! I had their Brie, Marinated Artichoke, and Smoked Salmon (yes, I actually ordered fish!) Bruschetta; each had it's own flavor and textures and I liked them all, although I liked the Brie best.  It was an interesting venue for a Bridal Shower, at times I think our group was a little too loud for the surrounding tables, and when the bride-to-be started opening her gifts...well, it's a family restaurant so I think everyone was a little embarrassed bystanders and invitees/gift-givers alike.  Next time I come I will order an entire meal, this place was great.

Bri and Glenn D. were kind enough to show me around my own hood and picked out one of the best pizza joints I've been to in a while! This place can be summed up in one word: character. This place is over-flowing with 'let's go back again and again and again.' kind of character. The Pizzeria is located in the front of the store and there is an entrance from the back too. I think they are working to combined the bakery and the pizzeria into a cohesive location. The Pizza was AMAZING! The crust was soft, dense, chewy goodness. The sauce had a hidden sweetness to it, that was just subtle enough to make you want more. Both orders from Bri and Glenn looked amazing too.   The seating is intimate, but the front windows are floor to ceiling huge, which give the space a very open feeling (plus the wall that divides the front of the store from the back of the store was only a half wall so that also kept the space open) They have seating all along the front window - so it's definitely a place to successfully people watch without the strange stares when you get caught :} and the art on the wall was cool, the old brick walls were cool - everything added to the character of this place!   I will definitely go back and I'm so glad I was invited to try this place out. Thanks Bri and Glenn for trying something in my own back yard!

Lets hear it for Costco! Costco has great customer service, clean aisles, openness, good deals on: gas, food, home, clothes... and selling my favorite pizza by the slice - Plus, I LOVE the free samples! If you are handing out free food, I'm there! (Maybe that's why Yelp events are so much fun for me!!)   I love coming to this location because it's really close to my house and it's not usually too crowded so I get pretty good parking. If any one wants to come with me on a Saturday for some free samples just let me know! :D

WOW, let me tell you! Travis and I had one of the best dates Friday night and it all started at La Piccola's! Friendly service take us 'to the best table in the house' and at first I thought they were just joking around, but they bring us into this cute little room and seat us in a window seat next to a fountain glowing with simple lights.   We ordered the Hummus appetizer - it was served with warm pita pieces. It was full of flavor and deliciously combined with baba ganoush. Yum  Then we moved onto dinner, I ordered the Turkey Roast with Raspberry Pepper Sauce - WOW! The turkey was tender and full of flavor, but not over-spiced. The combination of flavor when I used the Raspberry Pepper sauce was incredible. My Greek salad was amazing with the home-made dressing and the grill asparagus were perfect.  To top it all off, we ended the evening's dining with some Gelato. The food, service, and ambients was as good as it gets for me!  You can tell everything is home-made because at the end of my meal, I was full and well-fed but not bloated or weighed down by grease and salt. La Piccola Cucina has become my newest favorite in Italian restaurants and I'm excited to go back and try something new.

Okay here's what happened...I walk into the restaurant around 3pm and the very friendly hostess, seeing that it's just two of us, asks if we wanted to just sit at the bar. My friend does all the talking and soon we are sitting at the bar. This is when my first experience went to the crapper.   The bar tender was the worst server I've had in a while. When we first sat down she was so pushy about the drink menu kept pointedly asking what we would like to order - when we finally just asked for water she basically ignored us the rest of the time except to drop off our menus for our food. We didn't get our water until maybe 10 minutes after sitting there and we never got a refill. In fact after she took our orders - with the most disgusted look I'd ever seen - she didn't stop by after that to check up or to see if the food was good. When we were finally served our sushi (she didn't bring it to us) we were missing a whole order but she never stopped long enough for us to explain to her.   What I don't understand is how she stayed so busy because let me tell you, there was NO ONE at the bar. We finally had to flag her down for our check and even asked to get more water after we got our check. I realize that we were sitting at the bar and so I'm sure she was bummed that our tab wasn't going to be as high since we only ordered water. But you get paid on service and I am still mad that she was tipped at all. She was a nasty doofis, with a muffin top and saggy boobs and if she ever wants to make enough off tips to buy support bras she's gonna need to attend a few more customer service oriented classes.   Food wise I was not impressed with this place at all. Is the seaweed supposed to be slimy? I will definitely give sushi another try, but I wouldn't go here.

The burger I had there was tasteless and had a weird texture. The fries were decent and their signature Rootbeer was delicious, but I've definitely had better elsewhere.  In all fairness, I did not try their frozen selection, so I will definitely come back to give them another try.

Pampered Pinkie is a great place to go to get your nails done. The owner is fun and manages an awesome group of girls. If you are planning to get your nails done I would suggest Chris over the others. She is engaging and I have had the best quality in my nails with her. I used to bounce around from chop shop to chop shop but now that I have found a little quality I'm sticking - and if Chris leaves I would most definitely follow her to her new place or stop altogether.

I just love The Keg. Something I like is the consistency of the service, no matter where I go, I get great service and have a great time. This trip I got the Classic Prime Rib meal and followed it with The Keg's amazing Creme Brulee!   I think what keeps bringing me back to The Keg is the atmosphere. Whether you have a large group or want to keep it intimate with just a few people; the environment breeds great conversation and relaxing enjoyment. The mix of great food and great friends makes The Keg my #1 steakhouse.

Mallory, thanks for making this trip special for me and my guest!! Yes, it was Christmas Eve. Yes, it was kinda late and I'm sure you wanted to go home and yes, we were indecisive at times, but you gave us comfortable space to let us mull over the menu. You gave us great suggestions for drink pairings, and you were friendly, helpful and attentive when we needed you!  Most of all, thanks for reminding me why I love this steakhouse so much. The steak was tender and juicey, the lobster had a great firm texture and was flavorful. Our cesaer saled wasn't drenched in dressing and of course the complimentary bread was warm and soft.

I'm going to preface this review to let you know I am only reviewing the Gelato, not the chocolate/cafe.   This is a cute shop, right in the heart of the San Tan mall. The lady who was working behind the counter was a little person! The gelato was grainy, and the flavor was a little dry - how can ice cream taste dry? I don't make the rules, I just review them! There's a cute little table and chair setup just outside the cafe where we sat and finished our dry ice cream - the patio, and the little person behind the counter added just enough character to gain one more star out of me.   With so many gelato spots in the Valley, I don't see myself coming back for another round at this place. I have definitely experienced better.

This is my worst experience at a Sonic. The location is hard to reach, the service is real slow and even though it is all set up for a drive-thru, there is no drive-thru window. I felt like I could have gone to Applebees, ordered, ate and left before I got my meal from this Sonic location. If you ever have to endure a meal at this location you may be as shocked as I was at how impossible it seems to be to access - it's almost like they don't want customers.

This Chipotle is my favorite location, which is great because it's super close to my job! The employees are friendly and don't cut corners on your portions! Good food, great service and near by...could I ask for more? Nope :)

Boo on you!   I think Chipotle has just gone down hill. You know what Chipotle feels like to me? Pop culture...they coax you in with great deals, giving you as much food as you want, no complaints they have a "it's all about the customer" feel...they start to take over in popularity, everyone loves them, raves about them: they're healthy, they use organic ingredients, they are such big burritos!...but then a shift starts to take place...employees start to cut back on the good offers, not all stores, but some started to hesitate when you ask for more meat/beans, they bang the spoon a few more times to get just a little more beans or meat off....and then BAM! You're getting charged close to $2 extra for 4 more pieces of meat!! The extra charge for meat isn't even listed on the menu (but they do list the extra charge for their sucky guacamole).   In short, they took a great idea, watered it down, inflated the prices, and made their bottom line more important than customer satisfaction.   Piss on you Chipotle and everything like you.

Thank you BWW for the energetic atmosphere during football season!! When I don't plan right, I get the crappy table on the side, under the TVs but you have SO many TVs I can still watch my Bears from any angle! The food is super greasy and I never feel good when I leave, but I'm not going there for the food - I love the united and random screams and shouts and I will continue to put my stomach through the ringer just to be a part of all the commotion!

I have been to this location at least 3 times. Every experience has been wonderful. I have had their steaks (which are melt-in-you-mouth-goodness), salads, every side imaginable (Mmm twice-baked potatoes) and their creme brulee (which is to die for!) - I went once with my friend and his son and they brought us a fruit plat for his kiddo. Really great service, friendly people and a wonderful menu.

The best thing about this place was the bathrooms! They were great, I would pee in them any day of the week. The food (lobster, fillet mignon) was nothing special and for the price I would have expected a little more food then what I got, that's for sure. The food came almost too fast which gave me the impression that the food was pre-made and just microwaved, and most of it was almost cold - so if I was them I would invest in a better microwave.   They did have good shrimp but you only get 3.   I have definitely had better and paid less for it.

So, I have recently been introduced to the Golden Corral, and I am pleased to make its acquaintance! I think what I like about Golden Corral the most is the kind of food I get to pick from. Forget American Chinese, American Mexican, American Japanese, and the like...give me some good ol' AMERICA food. There's nothin' fake or missing from their wide arrange of options and dishes. And everything is tasty and appealing to me, which isn't always the case in other buffets I've tried. The rolls are amazing and the desserts are tasty.   The only complaint I have is that they don't bring you bread any more...I know, it's a petty complaint, but I'm just sorry I had to lose the ONE service they provided that I really don't want to do for myself...oh wait, they get your refills too.

Okay I went here on recommendation from some Yelpers and I have to admit a personal flaw...I add letters into words and flip things around when I'm reading sometimes, so this whole time I'm thinking Cornish Pasty is a Pastry (notice the 'r') joint...  I know, I know, "didn't I read the reviews??" Yes, of course I read the reviews; but I'm like the ship Titanic...once I get an idea in my head it's really hard to 'turn the ship around' as it were...  Once I got over the initial shock that this was, in fact not a pastry place, but a pasty place; I was pleasantly surprised! This place is great! Our server was friendly, talkative and attentive. The music was a little loud, but for the setting, I think it was at an appropriate level.  I got the Philly Steak pasty and savored the flavors of the meat and man, that pasty crust was dang good too!! Yummy! Even though I had some personal problems in the beginning, it turned out to be a FABULOUS experience and I would recommend it to other Yelpers looking for some good eats.

Hob Nob I am so happy to have you in my life :}  This is the place to be for GREAT food and GREAT football! Da Bears have the ultimate den here!  But not ONLY do they have the Chicago passion for football, but they also stay true to Chicago's passion of food! The chips and salsa had great flavor, the chips weren't some paper thin rice cake they had substance! and the salsa had just enough spice to keep you coming back for more!   They claim their gyros are the best and I have to AGREE 100% tender meat, full of FLAVOR (not salt) and the pita never got soggy. MmmMMm  Some of my highlights from tonight: - GREAT food - Da Bears fight song whenever we scored - Da Bears shuffle and other Bear-tribute songs during half-time - All the Chicago fans - The owner coming out and giving high-fives to all the Bears fans even when things were looking bleak. :}  Thank you Hob Nob, I will be back!

I am so excited for my member ship here!! I signed up on a special and got a month to month Unlimited package for $50 (a month)! Yoga Deva is clean and offers a variety of yoga sessions at all levels.  The place is new so they are still working out scheduling and classes. They have a class called Zumba which is spanish dancing and I am looking forward to that! Any one want to join me??

I like this place for a few reasons: 1. They play oldies like Hall n Oats and Phil Collins and had TV monitors with Football! Not typical for most Italian restaurants I've been too and I like it because it doesn't feel stuffy or fake.  2. The owner is so sweet and entertaining - he came by and asked us how our meal was. His ora is pleasant and it's clear he loves what he does.    3. Um, the food is fantastic!! I got the chicken parmesan with fettucini and their Vodka sauce - it was too die for! We also had the bruschetta (Mmh!) and their bread/butter was great too (a little bit too much flour on top of the bread but not a big deal).  4. Huge portion sizes, so I took my left overs home and enjoyed it again the next day. Yum!  I am definitely a fan and hope to come back again real soon!

I have lived in many locations all over the valley, but my stay at Azul apartments has been my best ever. The management team here is helpful and nice. The community is clean and pet friendly. They have just added DIRECTV dishes on the tops of all their buildings - they have flat screens in their pool area and just yesterday I used the bathrooms in the pool area for the first time, oh my goodness, they were wonderful!! The prices for these apartments are fair and I would recommend this Mark-Taylor facility to whom ever was looking for a safe, clean, fun location.

Generally speaking I like Panda Express, but this location is very impersonal. The employees don't look at you when they are helping you with your food, they don't look at you when you ask them questions...and sometimes they will look at you when you are paying for your food. But don't try to ask any questions because they react like you've just asked a complicated math equation...when really you just wanted chop sticks.

This post office provides the worst customer service! I know that's not saying much for any government run organization, but honestly...I thought postal workers had to pass a test or something in order to qualify...Basic Listening Skill trainings need to be implemented immediately!   I recently moved and submitted my change of address. I have been in my home for a little over 3 weeks and I have yet to receive 1 piece of mail. I called in to figure out where my mail is and the lady who answered the phone (after a wait time of 30 minutes) says, "oh that house is vacant" Um...how can that be if I'm calling about my mail not arriving...wouldn't that mean I'm living there now? "Oh, well you will need to find out where your mail is being sent." Uh, yeah, that's why I'm calling the POST OFFICE - It's not like my mail is being sent to another location as this is the main post office for my area, and it's not like the loan documents have the wrong address...they want me to come into the location - which conveniently closes before I get off work and fix the problem. I just hope when I come in I can get it all straightened out...   Where is my freedom to choose my own post office location? I hate government workers...no offense to the competent ones, but you have to realize you are the minority...

Yay! I have soft water!! When I was getting ready to move into my new house, I found out it had a soft water loop with no soft water unit. So I began my search for soft water units, I found this company online. Gave them a call, I work weird hours but they were able to stop by and evaluate everything while I was at work.   They did the install and came by to explain everything to me on a day when I was home. They even did it before I paid them. I got the best service, they were great at communicating with me and leaving me notes and instructions. Great guys and when I want to expand my water quality I am going to get their R/O system.   Check out their website and give them a call!! Their direct cell numbers are:  Tom Atkinson: (602) 339-0784 (cell) Tom Knapp: (602) 339-1427 (cell)

Not entirely impressed with Golden Spoon...I've definitely had better yogurt and toppings. Plus I feel really gross after eating it - the reason this review is getting 2 stars instead of just 1 is they do give you a golden spoon to eat with, which I think is cute :)

If you are in the market to be prepared for natural disasters like Katrina definitely make Foodwise one of the places you visit. You can also find freeze-dried or dehydrated products. They carry fruits, vegetables, grains, beans and pasta. But they also carry dairy products...yes that's what I said, dairy. They have dehydrated cheese, butter, eggs, shortening, milk...you name it, they probably have it. I was blown away by the things available in their store. They also have PETE jars, water containers in all sizes, and seal-able buckets in different sizes for all your needs.  Foodwise is owned and operated by Brent and Kristi Averett. Both were at the store when I came in and they were so helpful and knowledgeable about my different storage questions. It also looked like their store is all set up in the back for demonstrations.   I am very impressed and will definitely be coming back as I expand my storage content. Foodwise is definitely as good as it gets!!

Dance much? This is the first country dance hall that I have been to in ages. It's located in a discrete building right in down-town Mesa.   5 bucks gets you into 3-hours of non-stop country dancing. They play slow, swing, and today's best country tracks (with a few line-dances here and there). Like I said, it has been forever since I did any kind of real dancing (hehe) so I was a little nervous - but my nerves were left at the door because I had a blast! I've been two weeks in a row and just like anything the crowd fluctuates, but there are always guys flipping girls around in the air - and lots of people willing to lend a hand if you need help with the basics.  I am not so brave as to let a guy take me off the ground, but the crowd has such diverse dancing levels that nobody stands out. Though I have to say (from a people-watcher stand point) those couples doing flips in the air are amazing to watch!  However, I fit right in with the peeps wanting to keep both feet on the ground as we dance around the floor. Line dancing is always a blast and if you don't know what you're doing, you can just jump in and learn as you go!!   I've had so much fun at 12 W Main and it's an awesome place to go for some great music and fun! It's only Wednesday nights from 9pm - midnight and it's $5 a person.   Oh! And they have karaoke! Not every week, but I think they try to do it every other night, I will try to get a website where they make announcements for things like that.  There are bottled waters for .50 cents, but nothing else - so eat first.

Bummer. That's all I can say - I wish I could like this place, but it's too ostentatious.   Basically, this is a Mexican restaurant going through a identity crisis. You walk in and it's really clean, but there's no smell - I mean, where's the spice, the flavor, the umph? There was none.   Moving on...the people behind the counter - very friendly, no problems there. I get my food and hortacha, and this burrito is the size of a burrito from Taco Bell...except at TB I pay $.99 and here I paid $2.50 - the beans were runny and I was a bit disappointed in the taste/texture of the tortilla.   The hortacha was tasty but the same as a Fili-b's, and a few cents more.  Here's the thing...we have Baja Fresh for the over priced, Rubios for the beachy/hip feel. We have all the -bertos and Taco Bells for the authentic and cheap...and all of these provide overall better tasting food - why would I go back to Tia?  What I really need from Tia, is some proof that they really care that I come back. I need them to show me they are ready to compete...because right now they're not cuttin' it and I know I've experienced better.

YUM! Been here twice now and I love the service and the food. It's a cramped space with steaming serving trays with a good variety of Indian foods just waiting to be tried. At the table they bring you a baked flat bread with cheese and for dessert an Indian style rice pudding and peach pudding.

Yum! I have tried a variety of the Asian buffets but have never been to one quite like this. All the food was SUPER tasty! The soup wasn't quite hot enough but everything I tried had great flavor! I think my favorite thing was (of course) the dessert, pineapple ice cream with a fruit cobbler thing - YUM!  If you are looking for main-stream, run of the mill type service or atmosphere then go somewhere else, this Thai buffet has some personality quite unlike the 'typical' buffet.

I signed up with Quick n' Clean about 3 weeks ago in their monthly special which lets me get my car washed once a day if I want, for just 20 bucks. Cool right? Well, it has been great the last 3 weeks because I get off work around 6pm, and on my way home I stop by the car wash for a nice cleaning (they close at 7pm). Well, Wednesday I get there just after 6:30pm and it's all closed up!! What? Their sign says 7pm, there's no signs indicating a reason for this early closure...I'm so annoyed and confused! I skipped Thursday, because I had the intentions to call down there and yell at someone...but I forgot. So this morning I go in the morning (thank goodness they were open - I mean they were supposed to be, but who knows any more, right?). So I pull up and the gate opens and there's some idiot in a parked car who I wave to, to come over to my car and he just stares at me. I continue to wave and in the mean time I let another car in the other lane go in front of me, so the guy noticing that I'm not going away walks over to me and is like "can I help you?" and I was like "yeah, what time do you guys close?"   Him: "what?" Me: "What time do you close? You're sign says 7pm." Him: "Uh, no, we don't stay open THAT late any more, not when it gets so dark early." Me: "Oh yeah? When you close now?" Him: "6:30" Me: "Well, it would help if you decide to change your hours that you let your customers know. I get off work at 6pm and the ONLY reason I decided to do the monthly special is because of your hours."  The moron just stares at me like he could careless...which is probably exactly what he was thinking. Am I wrong to ask for a little common courtesy? Is it CRAZY or UNREASONABLE to ask that my car wash to be consistent with their hours of operation? If this idiot really is a manager, then what a sad, sad excuse for a manager he is - He has terrible customer service skills and an obvious disregard for other people's time and money.   Does 30 minutes really make THAT much of a difference?? And if so...WHERE'S the signage for people like me who will just assume the official sign that says 7pm is what the official time should be...  I wouldn't recommend this place to ANY ONE on Yelp and definitely not a single one of my friends.   There's a car wash on Gilbert and Baseline and another one on Alma School, just south of Southern. Take your pick; both have nice people and service you can count on.

Okay, so I filed a complaint with Star Command (upper management) and I explained how I was treated and how upset their manager made me feel - and they not only addressed my issue with the manager, really tried to make it right with me. They ended up refunding my money with no problems and apologized for the way he treated me. Because of the way they handled me (and I was not happy), I'm impressed by the care they took to make things right. I would recommend this location with the assumption that you'll be taken care of if things go south.

THANK YOU Monsterland! Mesa is starting to get hip and normal. Who doesn't want Halloween available all year round? I LOVE that you have live music, that your waiters play dress up, and that your menu stays consistent with your spooky themes. The Dr. Jekyll chicken sandwich is so tasty...well actually everything I've tried has been tasty so far!   May I suggest that you turn on a few more lights so we can read the menu better, and where are your bathrooms??  You have a fan in me! I will keep spreading the word!!

Super excited to write this review. I have had my taxes done by Sundin & Fish for the last few years, not just that but I take advantage of their payroll services and they have also helped me with a few investment questions.   I meet with them several times throughout the year because it's worth it to me to stay on track. Mostly nothing changes, but I usually have questions about different things I hear and there have been minor adjustments we did that helped me at the end of the year. They do not charge me fees whenever I meet with them. But mostly, what I appreciate about them is they tell me what I need to do, no fluff. Whether I talk to Paul, Jason, Jeanice, Ryan or Nate. My life is super busy, but it's nice having such an amazing team to turn to whenever I have questions or when it's tax time.  I would encourage any one who is looking for a CPA to check them out.

If you are expecting an AMAZING sandwich...try some place else. Potbelly is just another quiznos-esk sandwich shop. Nothing unique, nothing special - well they do have a PB&J sandwich.  I got the 'A Weck' tasted alright, I liked the warm toasted bread (just like Quiznos and Subway). To be honest for a sub that had 4 difference kinds of meat on it, I was a little disappointed that I tasted more mustard than meat.  Thomas got the Meatball and was kept looking at his sandwich to make sure there was actually meat on it...hardly any marinara sauce, I don't think he tasted a single meatball.  I'm actually surprised at the amount of 5 stars for such a run-of-the-mill sandwich. Good, food, but I've definitely experienced better.

Yuuuuummy! A group of us came here after a movie Saturday night. None of us had ever tried Fatman's, but it sounded better than any of the other options and after our experience we will definitely be coming back. When you go [and I suggest you give them a try!!} get ready for some delicious Chicago style pizza BBQ.    My husband and I ordered a thin crust pepperoni pizza, a gyros, beef tips, and 4 meatballs on the side. Other members of our group ordered a deep dish (ham and garlic), thin meat lovers, and pizza pockets as an appetizer. Everything was wonderful. The owner came out and spoke with us to verify our orders and we always had a full drink. When your check is over a certain amount you get to spin a wheel and get free stuff - we scored some BBQ wings! I can't believe this hidden gem is all the way in AJ! But we will be back soon and are excited to try some new things.  This locally owned business has a great environment, it's not too fancy or over the top. I loved the decor and the facade. It's cash only, but they have an ATM if you don't carry cash. Come give it a try!!

I am so excited to call this a Mesa restaurant! We have returned a couple times and have had wonderful times each visit! What to expect:  - full flavor - tender meat - CHOICES (my husband is a big fan of choices) - cozy atmosphere - live music some nights - YUMMY desserts (my favorite part of any meal)  We will continue to come back and hope foodies looking for a new spot will give this one a try!

Why review a jail you might want to say, well cause there are so many things that are just not okay.  Like for example, your cell phone is no good, DOs won't let you bring it in, though you wish you could.  Be careful with belts, watches and all your bling, Off they will come if you set off that metal detector thing.  Also, don't expect to see your loved one face to face, You can see them at other jails, just not at this place.  You only get 30 minutes to visit which could be okay but you only get to go on Sunday or Monday.  You should also expect delays and even shortened visits, mostly because DOs can't tell time or count minutes.  Sometimes you wonder and think: Only 30 minutes in a single week?  Doesn't the MSCO know they have people in there? that we still love and hold dear?  Well, 30 minutes is gone in no time at all  especially in that cramped little video stall.  Some might deserve being wrung through the system, but others are young, sweet and we missed them.  Basic human rights of dignity and nutrition  are often over looked for the inmates of this institution.  I wish I had better things to say for those that go, but there's not much good that comes from Sheriff Joe.  I hope this has been insightful  for those of you who need to know    the worst place in Phoenix is operated by the M.S.C.O.

So I've never been to Moreno's before and I feel like I have missed out on some delicious food! For any new comers, you NEED to try the Estilo Sonora - basically hot dog heaven. It's an easy and cheap add on to your meal, especially if you like hot dogs with lots of toppings and an amazing bun - You won't be disappointed.   My other order was pretty plain and simple, a bean and cheese burrito. It was done right and tasted like it should. Food came out quick enough for a great work-lunch spot and we had great service.  Word to the wise: the booths aren't comfortable if you're on the larger side...I'm just saying.
