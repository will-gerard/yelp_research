Wow! So I work at a prison and I've had inmate meals occasionally, so there is a certain standard of food and taste that I have developed. It's really not that hard to please me with food, especially after having prison food but Sam's cafe really questioned whether or not I was an inmate that night.   I ordered one of their specials, which was the pork enchiladas. When I got the tray, I initially thought they had mistaken the dish for a three rolled tacos, with mole-like sauce? First I had to decipher if it was fried, which was later confirmed. Then the sauce on top was definitely something that you cannot label. It had a sweet, mole, yet bitter taste, with sour cream that was light and fluffy and made it look like whip cream. I know . . . strange you say? The pork was dried out and even the two of us could not finish this one meal that was split. The beans tasted hallow, if that's even possible and the rice was extra dry.   I am sorry to give this such a harsh review, but it's the truth and sometimes the truth hurts. I have to say they do have great margaritas and the best part was the complimentary white chocolate, pecan thing they gave at the end. Sorry Sam's but this will be my first and last time.

My friend and great dinner companion visited Rokerij and was I in for an unexpected wonderful night of food.  I heard about this place but never really believed the food was this delicious.  We ordered  and shared best of two worlds: the porterhouse steak with mashed potatoes and roasted eggplant and the swordfish with the green chile sweet potato and broccolini.  With Sunday night's half off bottle of wine, this is a great Sunday dinner place.  Rokerij, you will forever be in my heart as one of the best dinner restaurants in central phoenix.

Thanks Yelp reviewers! I found E's Urban hair on yelp and the reviews are very accurate. I was matched with Marissa and she is wonderful! Due to my thick and full volume Asian hair, I have a hard time finding people who know how to cut through this jungle head of mine. Marissa immediately asked if she could use razor techniques for my hair, which I prefer. I have received so many compliments already about my hair.   The building is located in a strip mall (what isn't here in PHX?) but once you step in, it's really cute and chic. They offered me a glass of wine and went right to work with my hair. I even mentioned the Yelp ad and received 20% off on a reasonable cost ($30) of hair cut already.

Cakes! Cupcakes! Cookies! Muffins! Donuts! Bagels! What else do you really need? We have visited Barb's on several occasions including our appointment for our wedding cake. Our cake expert was very helpful and patient since we both were kind of clueless and indecisive about our cake. In the end, it was an enjoyable process and hoping for the cake of our dreams (will update after cake received). They were very accommodating and I would highly recommend them for cake consultation.   On to their goodies . . .  Red velvet cupcake- deliciously red and fantastic cream cheese frosting  Chocolate mouse cake- mousse is so creamy and the balance between sugar and cream is perfectly delightful.  Cappuccino cupcake- Can I have this every morning with my coffee?  Tiramisu cake- Leaves you wanting to go back for more  Pink Champagne cupcake- So pretty Cosmo cupake- Not sure what it is but so damn good!  Their cake is so good that we gambled on a mousse filling that we did not even try during the cake tasting for our wedding cake, but we are confident that it will be just as decadent as the others.   If you want happy cakes go here :)

I really wanted to like this place. Due to poor service and overpriced entrees, they only get 2 stars. We ordered the black bean fritters with avocado dip, the pulled pork, the Cuban style steak and flan for dessert. It was just "ok." The food alone was at least 3 stars; however, in my opinion the price was too expensive for the quality of their food. If I'm going to pay $30 for my meal, I want to at least sit on a non-patio plastic chair.   On to the service . . . the whole time, we wished we had the other waiter. He seemed happy to work there and was so informative to his customers. Our server was more concerned about pushing us to order more food that she decided to slack on her waitressing abilities (i.e. refilling water). She would say subtle things to make us feel like we were not ordering enough, such as "that's it! just one dessert?," "any other appetizer?," "are you sure you don't want a sangria?" These weren't said with a smile either. She was worried about her tip amount, and she should be after how she treated us. Needless to say, I would have given them 1 star but the food made up for it.   I think I'll try some place else for my Cuban fix.

Se-pe-cee-altee Loll-suh (Specialty Rolls). I can just hear my Korean parents saying this and commenting that is not real sushi.   Tokyo Lobby has various specialty rolls that will blow your mind! Besides the usual Philly, Las Vegas, rainbow, and caterpillar roll, they have several additional unique rolls. They have a Marilyn Mon roll that has Spicy tuna wrapped w/ albacore and tempura onion, ichi roll that has tempura on shrimp tempura, and fiesta salmon roll with Spicy salmon w/ jalapeno on spicy crab, extra spicy. These are just a few yummy rolls that I have tried.   I also had to have my hamachi (yellowtail) fix and ordered a sashimi plate of hamachi and it was absolutely delightful. Tokyo Lobby is one of the better sushi restaurants in AZ. I miss fresh sushi and find it difficult to for great sushi in AZ but Tokyo Lobby did not disappoint me.

I am so disappointed because I thought we finally found a good honest place to take our cars. Yelp has 5 star reviews on them, so how could we go wrong! We got a timing belt, water-pump, driver's belt replaced. In addition we also got the front brake pads and rotors replaced along with an oil change on my wife's car. We left thinking, "Wow, those guys at the desk are super nice and genuine" and felt comfortable about the repairs that we didn't even look under the hood when we got it back. Boy, were we wrong! So wrong that it almost cost my wife's life.  As my wife was driving her car on the highway, the accelerator locks and she is now in a terrible nightmare and the main character on the movie Speed. She cannot stop, trying to lift the accelerator pedal, braking, frantically swerving around cars to avoid hitting another person and by the grace of God, she finally was able to stop by taking the keys out.  The police officer found a bracket that was NOT bolted down and the bracket had moved to the point where it was compressing the accelerator line. He actually informed my wife to take a picture of this before he moved the bracket, so she could take it back to Back to Basics.  Here's the kicker. It was obvious that Back to Basics had to have moved this air conditioning bracket to get to the timing belt on this civic. They denied they ever touched the bracket. In fact, the guy said "Its the craziest thing, the bolt must of popped out and wiggled down a tube." We took the car to another mechanic, who laughed and stated "there is no way that a mechanic can get to your timing belt, without removing the bracket and by pushing the air conditioning hose to the side." There is NO WAY that a bolt screwed in could have somehow popped out.  After Back to Basics said they "fixed" it and tightened the bolt down, we didn't feel safe so we took it to another auto shop. This mechanic double checked and visibly showed us that it was still not completely tightened. We were just so disturbed. You mess up once (never admitting and denying with a bogus answer) and then you become careless a second time?  I am sorry that this review is so long, but trust me it could have been longer with additional information about the negatives of this shop. The managers, K**** and D***, who we dealt with were very nice and mild mannered, but that does not negate the fact that they have mechanics who are sloppy and careless. What consumers don't realize is that the front desk managers don't work on your cars. It's the mechanics they hire and obviously they have car mechanics, who do careless work. Everyone is human and we make mistakes, but this mistake is too big and basic (putting a bracket on securely with a bolt) that could of killed my wife and others on the road. Our relationship with Back to Basics could have turned out differently. We might of even considered going back if they had just admitted they messed up; however, their lie and denial of what happened left us sick to our stomach.  Back to Basics, please train your mechanics the basics again so this does not happen to future customers.

Asbury United Methodist is a place for all!  The congregation is welcoming, diverse in age, race and sexual orientation.  Pastor Jeff is a warm person who is real, down-to-earth, and you know that he is passionate about his ministry for the community.  They are social justice minded and teach what true love and compassion (real messege of the Bible) is about.  If you stopped going to church due to being tainted with hypocritical, conservative, and narrow-minded theology, then go to Asbury where you will be refreshed and feel accepted.  The only difference I have is the style of service, which is not the preferred contemporary worship that I prefer; however, everyone varies when it comes to worship style and I have grown to like it.

I decided to grab dim sum after I watched Bizarre on the food channel and Andrew was in China eating all these delicious Chinese dim sim. Typically, I go to Golden Buddha in the Chinese Cultural center, but I was recommended that Great Wall has better dim sum.   Please keep in mind that I admit, I went during the end of the rush (1:00pm) on a Sunday so I had appropriate expectations. However, there was only 2 carts going around trying to sell their leftovers from the rush and was really disappointed. We ordered the chicken feet, pork bun, hak-kwah, bok choy and it was just okay. In fact, I would have to say it was quite bland and the sauce on some of the dishes were salty and tasteless. The chicken feet I usually get is cut into pieces and not battered but the way they served it at the Great Wall, compromised my gag reflex. I am not one to be shy of eating different parts of animals, in fact ox tail is one of my favorite meat but my stomach could not handle their chicken feet.   I would assume we would have received better service and tastier food if we had gotten there a little earlier but I think I am going to stick with my usual place. Flagging the carts down continuously was a little more stressful than what I want when eating dim sum.

I really wanted to like the services at this place because it was recommended by a friend and I wanted to support a Sunnyslope establishment. However, after my dog came home limping due to "knicking" her paw pads, and seeing that her nails were not trimmed (nails were curled), I am done giving my hard-earned money to this grooming place. I had no idea that her nails were not getting trimmed until I heard my dog yelping with pain. All I saw was her left leg curled against the side of her body. Find out, she was scratching her body and her long hair got tangled on her nails where it was curled. She ended up pulling out a chunk of her body hair!   I will spare you the rest of the story. I was so distraught that I could not even call them on this because they seem to have an excuse for everything. This is not the first time, they have "forgotten" to do something while conducting a full groom.  Needless to say, please take your dogs to another groomer so your dogs do not have to experience this hardship :(

I've never been to a pottery painting place before, but a friend recommended something new to do on a Saturday afternoon. They took our last-minute reservation and BONUS, there were no birthday parties or rugrats that afternoon.   When you walk in, you see a wall of unpainted pottery choices. I decided on painting my own wine goblet. The staff were very helpful in explaining the process to newbies like myself. I wanted to paint cherry blossoms on my goblet, and when I shared my idea with Maci she was extremely helpful giving me one-on-one tips to create my own.   My friend wanted to create a polka dot design and they were out of circle stickers, so Maci offered to hand-cut exactly what she wanted. They recommend planning to spend at least an hour, but because my friend and I are type A perfectionists with no artistic inclinations we found we needed 3 hours. Luckily, if you make a mistake on your ceramics, they can rectify your mistake with a careful erasing technique, a wet q-tip.  Once you have finished, they glaze your pieces that are ready to be picked up in 2-3 days.  As You Wish is a reasonably priced place to go to create an art piece.

Hands down! Best Ecuadorian food in Phoenix . . . okay maybe the only Ecuadorian food in Phoenix but still it is phenomenal. We ordered the goat stew and the plantain ball soup with shredded beef. Both of us could not stop salivating over each spoonful and bite. The stew sauce for the goat was amazing and the goat meat was very tender. They served 3 large slices of plantain that was the sweetest plantain I have ever eaten. They only serve the plantain ball soup on the weekends and so we were happy to have ordered it on Sunday. The broth was so good that it was drinkable on it's own. The food took a little longer than expected, but it was so worth it as the cook seemed to have made both dishes after our order. No pre-made stew or soups left to boil and serve.   I will definitely be back to try other dishes. I am so mad that I did not find this jewel of a restaurant earlier after living 5 minutes from this place for the last 4 years. My goal is to hit this restaurant at least once a week and try everything on the menu. I love you Mi Comida!   Mi Comida is a restaurant that Phoenix desperately needs. Good food, great staff, and everything is homemade. Their food alone has inspired me to plan a trip to Ecuador.

One of the best Thai in the valley!  I'm not sure how high it would be on the authentic Thai scale; however, they have some yummy creative dishes . . .crispy basil chicken.  A friend got the Bombay curry and Thai ice tea, which she thought was delicious.  Surprisingly, there was no wait on a Saturday night.  Ambiance was great.  The menu had a wide variety of dishes.

I had a mixed feeling about this Guess outlet store.  The prices were decent as it should be because it's an outlet store, but the selection was very small.  The men's section was decent, which I tend to take a peek occasionally because I like their men's tees.  The women's section was scarce with limited tops and pants.  If you are a Guess shopper, I suggest that you skip this outlet store and go to a mainstream Guess store.

What a great unexpected surprise of delicious Indian food in my hood! We didn't get to do too much research on Indian restaurants that night and since there are not many great Indian restaurants in Central and North Phoenix, I didn't feel compelled to put in the effort. Learned helplessness you can say. After driving around before our movie, we found this wonderful restaurant and will be coming back for more.   Tandoori Times has great ambiance with fun Indian art on the wall. Our servers were very pleasant and you can tell they were happy working there. We tried the lamb briyani, saag paneer, and chili naan. Although they had some innovative and creative Indian dishes we decided to stick with more traditional dishes. The saag had a slightly more watery consistency than what I am used to but the taste was incredible. The lamb briyani was light and not so oily like other briyani dishes. My favorite was the chili naan, which was light, fluffy, and tasted awesome baked with chilies and cilantro. Their side "condiments" was unique, which included a mixture of pickled chopped ginger, lemon, garlic and other spices.   We were so glad to have tried this restaurant and hope to be back to try their other dishes.

Switch is my fav when it comes to appetizers, brunch (running close with Postinos), and crepes! I have come here numerous times and have yet to be disappointed. The garlic hummus is a must and I will go as far and say it's the best restaurant hummus I have found in AZ. The hummus is nice and creamy with a double hint of gaaarlic . . .yum. Their brunch menu is perfect with quiches, omelettes, pancakes, and crepes. Don't forget the $1 mimosas on Sundays.   The ambiance is relaxing and fun. They have a cute outdoor patio and they have warmers during the winter months. The waiters and waitresses have always been helpful and friendly. I would recommend Switch anytime to anyone looking to eat at a fun place with good food.

I have to say, the dim sum here is phenomenal. I was a little put off by the significant lack of decor but the food definitely made up for it to get 4 glowing stars. We ordered the pork pineapple bun (worked well with the sweet bread and salty pork), cilantro flat rice noodle (lots of cilantro, so good), har gow (large shrimp filling), fried bean curd, curry pastry (wow the indian/chinese spice worked), and jasmine tea.   All the dishes were nice and fresh since it was straight from the kitchen. No carts used here and it was actually ok. Even better than ok! Initially I thought carts made dim sum fun but now I think about it, I had more time to relax and enjoy the food rather than looking around like a paranoid schizophrenic eyeing a cart to come around. It's like when you go out with friends for Korean bbq and they want to grill the meat on the table because it's new and fun. I usually get stuck with grilling duty so I make sure everyone is happy with their pieces of meat. Sometimes I wish the chef just cooked it in the kitchen so my clothes don't have to stink for the rest of the night and I could enjoy my food without looking paranoid to make sure everyone is getting their meat.   In sum, China Chan offers fresh, nicely filled, hot dim sum that will not disappoint you. I'm definitely coming back.

Breadfruit was the perfect place to have my birthday dinner. Although it's a bit small, they accommodated our party of 6. The food is something to rave about with the browned chicken stew that uses few ingredients but key ingredients in making a good dish (i.e. ginger, spices, etc). My friend had the chicken and dumplings, which she could take it or leave it since the wheat dumplings were dense; however, the jerk chicken was described as "very good."  It included a juicy and tender piece of chicken and the right combination of corn, plantains, and pineapples. They advertise using fresh local ingredients and you can tell with the vegetables that were perfectly cooked (crispy). Another friend ordered the curried tofu, which was full of flavor and a dish that I am going to try next time.   Overall, Breadfruit has great food, excellent price for the quality of food, fun selection of non-alcoholic beverages, and a BYOB option. I will come back and see you again.

It was my first time at La Bocca and I was pleasantly surprised. Mill Avenue is not my usual preferred place to dine but after a fabulous performance at the gammage, I was hungry! So hungry that I couldn't wait to drive to eat. My friend recommended La Bocca because apparently, she used to frequent this establishment for happy hour quite frequently for their half off wine by glass. I will have to take advantage of that another time. Tonight I was all about food, although I did end up ordering one of their malbecs. I just can't pass up trying a new malbec.   We ended up ordering the plank of brucetta (pulled pork, roasted garlic & spinach, salmon, goat cheese & ?). My friend warned me that it was not like Postino's brucetta, which then I was immediately discouraged but took a chance anyway. I was very happy with the risk! The bread was not too overbearing and the toppings of fresh ingredients were plentiful that made me longing for more. We then ordered the sicily pizza. I give them credit for trying to make their pizza different than other pizzas in Phoenix. Their crust is much larger and poofier and the dough is super thin in the middle of the pizza. The body of the pizza is so thin that the oil and topping juices seeped through and turned the pizza slightly soggy. Not my favorite but because the toppings were so fresh and flavorful, I didn't mind it.   If I ever want to dine in Mill Ave, I will definitely come back to La Bocca's.

I've been here many times and I always tell myself that I will order something different but I always get their pho specialty there.  I was very happy to find this restaurant since Phoenix is not known for their Asian culinary; however, Vietnamese seems to be one of the better Asian cuisines here in the valley.    I have tried Pho in L.A., San Diego, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Boston and found the best Pho broth here at Nam Sao.  The rare beef could be a little more rare but everything else is perfect.  Fresh vegetables (bean sprouts, mint, cilantro, lemon instead of lime) and the clear and savory broth makes their pho stand out.

I REALLY wanted to like this place.  The cute cashier boy and the fun little stand was a great start; however, the tacos were another story.  I ordered the fish taco and the carna asada taco with green chile.  My tortillas were falling apart from the grease and from the large quantity of the meat, cheese, and cabbage.  That was not too bad but the flavor or the tacos were just plain salty.  So salty that I really couldn't enjoy the beef in my taco.  I tried the fish taco and the fish was "sick" as in not well, and ill.  That's what I call fish when they have this fishy smell that's beyond the normal fish smell.  I know my fish, trust me (I'm Asian okay) and the fish in my taco was just not right.    Granted the tacos were cheap and the quantity was large; however,  I rather pay more and eat a fish taco that is "not sick."

True Food indeed! The mixed reviews are telling so I am going to rate this purely from my experience last night. I started out with the hamachi and pomegranate sashimi. Wow, the combination was mouth watering after I ate my first piece. Who would have thought pomegranate with hamachi?   I ordered the curry and rice noodles with the shrimp. The dish involved more than just that of which it had perfectly cooked vegetables that brought out the flavor. I was pleasantly satisfied with the texture of the crispy vegetables and the soft rice noodles with a hit of curry. It was one of those dishes where in the beginning you question "I can't really taste anything" but then you take a couple more bites and it comes together. You start understanding why the combination of the celery, chards, cilantro with this type of curry and . . . okay I am just going to stop. It's one dish and it did it for me. We also ordered the caramelized onion tart with Gorgonzola and figs. I was not impressed and would recommend trying a different appetizer because there were many appetizers that sounded delicious .   They also offered all these creative healthy juices, which I want to try next time. Overall, we had a great dining experience. Our waitress seemed to be very knowledgeable about the menu and was very helpful in making our choices. This is obvious but I have to give True Food credit for creating yummy dishes using mostly organic, flax, and gluten free. The decor was very open, airy, and Frank Lloyd Wrightish.

We went to Tuck Shop the other night and wowser! The food is fricking delicious. So we started with the chicory salad, which was amazing. I am still day dreaming about the roasted hazelnuts and squash. We then devoured the dates stuffed with chorizo and cheese. It tastes exactly what it sounds like and it goes so well together. On to the larger sharing plate of chicken and waffles . . . this was simply heavenly. The meat of the chicken was so juicy and tender and the nice hue of rosemary and citrus was just perfect. The cheddar infused waffle was light and fluffy and gave the crust of the waffle a nice cheesy taste. The best part was the maple gravy-like syrup, which was something I have never experienced. Both of us were in silence and trying to savor every bite.   I forgot to mention the fabulous drink specials Tuesday through Thursdays. I knew the moment I saw all their mixed drinks with ginger ale that I was going to love this place. I could have drank spiced rum and ginger ale and the "dark and stormy" all night.   I love the idea of sharing plates because you get a variety without getting uncomfortably full. I wish a lot more restaurants had this concept. The ambiance was simple and cute with each table having purposeful mismatched chairs. My partner noticed that the seats of all the chairs were the same, which was a very smart design for equality of comfort. Tuck Shop you get all 5 stars for taste, selection, and ambiance.

Sorry Switch, My Florist, Bombaros, La Bocca, Main Ingredient, and other wine cafes that sell gourmet sandwiches and salads. Postino's has you all beat! Why you ask? Postino's has the best deals with consistent and high quality, delicious food and wine. I have been to Postino's on Central more than a handful of times and there is a reason I go back over and over. . . because you people make my dining experience so good.   First of all, Postino's has the best brucetta. Hands down! They use larger pieces of bread and their ingredients are really flavorful. Their sandwiches taste just a little bit fresher and yummier than other restaurants. I cannot put my finger on what it is exactly, but it is fabulous. They also have a great wine and beer program that changes every month. They seem to be able to incorporate different malbecs in their wine list, which is a super plus for me! Their new brunch menu is spectacular and although I have only ordered one thing on the brunch menu so far, I have seen the brunch plates come out of the kitchen and they all look so scrumptious.   Second, Postino's has deals that you just can't miss. Monday and Tuesdays after 8:00 pm you can order a bottle of wine and board of brucetta for only $20! $5 wine glass or pitcher of beer everyday until 5:00 pm. If you sign up for their email list, you get coupons for free meals occasionally. I just noticed that on Wednesdays they have a special word deal on facebook, when you write the word on a business card, you receive all glasses of wine for $5. During this time of recession, you make dining with reserve wine affordable.

I tried to be optimistic but just couldn't love really anything about the place. Maybe the pretty color scheme?   Coffee was just okay. There was nothing special that I couldn't get elsewhere. We went there for brunch and since the breakfast menu offered such an average selection, we ordered a sandwich instead. I don't recommend the Po Boy sandwich, which took over 20 minutes to make and tasted like s***. Sorry, but this is the reason why Phoenix is always missing something that urban cities have . . . character, taste, and uniqueness.   Don't get me wrong, we need more healthy food markets that are independently owned but Luci's standard for food and selection of what they sell is an extreme disappointment and even an embarrassment.

All I can say is "I've had better."    I've had better brucetta.  The bread was soggy from the toppings.  Ingredients didn't taste fresh.  I've had a better salad.  We split the veggie salad that tasted bland and I couldn't even taste the jicama and beans.  The avocado saved the salad.  I've had better service, but it wasn't the waitress' fault.  The manager should have hired more staff as this poor waitress was serving at least 20-30 people out on the patio.  It took us over an 1.5 hours to get our 4 piece brucetta and salad.  The only reason I am giving 2 stars is due to the great selection of wine. Sorry 5th and Wine but I'm sticking with Postinos.

Wine Styles introduced me to my new love for malbecs (Argentinian Red). This store is very user friendly because they categorize by wines with similar flavors such as bolds, mellow, crisp and others. How many times have you been to a store to pick out a cab or merlot and picked a bottle at random, sometimes by the color of the label or the ring of the name and have no idea what the wine would taste like? Wine Styles effective system leaves me confident in the bottle(s) that I choose knowing that it will have a similar taste of wine with other wines in that category.   They also have monthly wine classes, which I have taken and enjoyed very much. Classes are reasonably priced. Weekly wine tastings are pleasant and they offer complimentary food (fruit and cheese and crackers) as well.

Worse frozen yogurt!  They have a decent selection of flavors but none of them tasted good.  The texture was grainy and extremely sweet.  Toppings were being refilled with packaged candy and the fruits were not fresh.  I wouldn't waste my calories at this place.

If there was a half star, Centurion would get 4.5 stars.  I was slightly skeptical at first when there was just the chef and waitress in the restaurant.  Considering this was a Saturday night, I thought I didn't get the memo that this was a lunch-oriented place and not the place to be for dinner.  I was so glad to be wrong, for once and only for once.  They warmly greeted us as we entered.  We were so hungry that we started out with their cheese plate.  It was a nice assortment of manchego, double-creamed brie, and since i mentioned I loved blue, the chef gave us their blue that was not even on the menu.  You get to choose 3 cheeses out of 6-9 choices.  The cheese plate was nicely arranged with fruits (grapes, strawberries) and nuts.  In addition, he added fig jam and Dijon mustard that gave it a nice kick.  Compared to other restaurants in the valley, it was one of the nicer cheese plates and selections.  Next, on to 3 different kinds of risotto (coconut and shrimp, chorizo and manchego, white truffle), which were very rich.  The food just kept coming with our filet mignon, lamb, and halibut (entree for 2).  I know it was a lot of food for the 2 of us but I just had to try it all.  The filet mignon was good but although ordered rare, it was more on the medium rare side for me.  The sauce that was made for the lamb was fantastic; however, I've had a better cut of lamb.  It had a nice ambiance; however, the benches were very high and we had to move to another table.  Thankfully, the chef was aware of the issue and they are anticipating taking care of it.  The patio was really cute and inviting and will be a perfect place to grab a drink (once they get liquor license) after the weather becomes cool.   The chef was very personable and we will be back  to try his recommendation of the Espana pizza.  I hope others will try this place to keep it going because it's a wonderful independent restaurant that Phoenix needs!

How do they dare call this a Chicago hot dog?  The dog is the size of a pencil and you can't taste if it's real all beef.  If you are used to Chicago hot dogs from Chicago, don't go here!

Every bite of every tapas here are just pure bliss! Yellowtail and grapefruit, pork belly buns, oyster uni, Japanese pancakes . . . how can you not be salivating right now?   I am looking forward to trying the other tapas dishes. I may just have to push back visits to Sens.

Too early to write a review? Perhaps I will have a change of heart after the grand opening but I'm not holding my breath.  I've really tried to embrace downtown Phoenix as an urban area but it has truly been difficult.    If Cityscape just had one tall highrise (60+ floors), it would have given it such a different feel.  Or something that would have given Phoenix a landmark that signifies that it's truly a city.  This was Phoenix's chance to really be known as the 5th largest urban city; however, it just continues to be a spread of suburbia.  The same chain restaurants and retail shops (i.e. CVS, PF Changs, AJ's, Five Guys Burger, etc.) and high end boutiques that are supposedly going to be opening in Cityscape. . . aren't we getting bored of this?  In fact, Cityscape reminded me of Cherry Creek area in Denver . . . nice development and appropriately situated in the suburbs.  Cherry Creek did not make it as their downtown, so why are we?  I wished Cityscape would have been a downtown area that could have shown off Phoenix in a new light of excitement, diversity, uniqueness, and character.  Maybe someday, but not through Cityscape.

Excellent service! Fabulous food! Warm and modern ambiance!  The wait staff was cheerful and helpful, which made our dining experience very pleasurable.   On to the food . . .  the chopped salad is something to come back for with all the different textures of the ingredients and merried mixture of flavors. The porkbelly steak was outstanding and my partner loved the scallops. The star was the bread pudding (bacon pieces in every other bite was perfect) with homemade cinnamon ice cream.  I can't go back soon enough.  I miss you already bread pudding.

This little taco shop gets 5+ stars!   The fish tacos were out of this world, breaded and fried to perfection. I also tried the al pastor taco that was marinated well and you can taste the marinade in every bite. I also tried molotes for the first time. The cilantro salsa and red salsa was homemade and oh so good and spicy. The quesadillas are like cheese crisps. I am so disappointed that I did not find this place earlier since it's so close to home.   I have to try the other items in their menu soon. Price is very reasonable as their tacos range from $1-$1.50.

Being a massage junkie, I've experienced a wide variety of massage therapists and their techniques. The best advice I can give for clients is to find a massage therapist who is a "good match" for your needs. That's exactly what I did at the Art of Touch. My first massage experience with "T" was just okay. She did nothing wrong, except we were simply not a good match. I decided to try the Art of Touch again and this time it was with "C." Wow! I was so happy to have found her . . . my match. She was able to tailor the massage to my needs, which is not an easy task considering I have a roadmap on my back with knots planted in various locations. She listens and picks up on social cues quickly, which helps when you just want a massage in silence.  Art of Touch has very reasonable prices for their massages, especially when you buy a package. The decor inside the Coe house is super cute. Most of all, I feel good supporting this business. "C" uses superb quality lotion, oil, and even has a heated massage table. I have been there at least 5 times now and never found difficulty with parking. If you are looking for a massage therapist, you need to look no further and book an appointment with the Art of Touch, as they have a variety of massage therapists that will suit your needs.
