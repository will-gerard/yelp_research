This place is simply amazing!! I have been going to this salon now for over 8 years. The staff is great.. exceptional customer service! You definitely get more than you pay for. They make my nails look fabulous and they last for awhile too. Trust me, I have tried many, many, many other nail salons.. and I am a customer of Come for Nails for life!

It is unfortunate that this location is closest to me :( The service is not pleasant anymore.  When I first started visiting this Gilbert location- the staff was really nice & would offer dog biscuits to my puppy each visit. This hasn't been the case for awhile now.  My puppy is never offered dog biscuits anymore so he is totally over this place.  As for me, I expect better service at the register & drive-thru.  Employees that I have encountered are grouchy & not very friendly.  Boo!  Hopefully Dunkin Donuts will hire sunnier people for morning shifts and people that don't turn off the ovens over 30 minutes before closing!!  Just a thought...

good luck getting a response from this place!  I have tried out a couple different spray tan salons in the Valley, which I was introduced to through Groupon in the past.  I was very pleased with the spray tan results and the service I received at those places.. so I thought I couldn't go wrong when I purchased a voucher from Enamor for Twinkle Tan.  Well, I could and I did :(    Any girl knows that it is important that the people she calls on for beauty services are welcoming and attentive.  If you expect the same kind of service, try a different place!  I tried at least 3 times to make an appointment via text (as recommended by the voicemail) and electronically through the website and had to go long periods of time to even get a response and have not been accomodated yet.  Well, I'm not holding my breath and my voucher expired without getting used.  Don't waste your money like I did :/

As requested by Twinkle Tan, I wanted to provide some information to further support my previous review.  Check out the dates!  Apparently "shortly" means a month later.

Yelp is also a place to access honest reviews of shady businesses; and should not be used by business owners to give themselves a 5-star rating to mislead the public.  Good one, Twinkle Tan, you almost fooled me.  Attempt to schedule a spray tan appointment on 3/5/2012 via text message-  Me:     Hi!  My friend and I bought Enamor vouchers and noticed they are expiring soon- do you have any openings for tomorrow (Tuesday) or this weekend?  Pretty please thank you   Twinkle Tan:     We have openings Wednesday Thursday Friday Other than that we are booked.   Me:     Ok- when is the next Saturday appointment that you have available?   Sent from my iPhone  ***not holding my breath, but still waiting.....

Tried the long life chicken/rice soup & beef and broccoli  tonight.. They were delish!  Will definitely be visiting again soon.. Probably even just for a quick bowl of soup.  Yes, it is THAT good!

It's a shame- the burgers are actually good but I can't get over seeing the employee scoop my fries with his bare hands.  Ewwww.  Luckily, I said something & got new, untouched fries but can't shake the image
