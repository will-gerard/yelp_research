It was my first time at cherry blossom noodle cafe and it was definitely a good experience. The environment was quaint (I didn't notice the pictures on the walls until a little later). We were seated in what I felt was a little bit of an awkward spot where people were entering into the dining area.  We started out with drinks and I definitely liked the strawberry punch and the mango tango sake floats. The bread basket was definitely amazing (we ended up ordering two :) ). We also ordered the crispy calamari, pan fried gyoza, the ebi chili (upon waitress recommendation) and the shimeji mushroom and bay scallops pasta. The best was definitely the pasta and pan fried gyoza. Cherry blossom noodle cafe has a well deserved reputation for having amazing noodles. Our least favorite was the ebi chili. We thought that for 6 dollars the ebi chili was not as good as it should have been (especially if an employee recommended it). The sauce tasted almost like ketchup and the ebi itself was bland. The waitress did disappear for a little bit and it took longer for our pasta to come out because of a "mix up". Overall a good food experience (still craving the bread).

Tried out their veggie burger sandwich with garlic. I loved how good the bagels tasted and they were definitely fresh. I also tried their coffee and desserts. Not bad. Their cinnamon roll with icing were pretty good.

Today I went to Ulta and I am brand new to town.  I was fortunate enough to have a staff member right away ask me if I needed help.  I said no at first because I wanted to keep looking but I listened into the advice she was giving another customer and she was quite helpful.  Afterwards I started looking seriously into buying something and this nice lady named Naoemi (sorry if I misspell your name!) came to help me find a good eye shadow that would suit my needs.  She even did my makeup and she definitely knew what she was doing.  I love it and I still have it on!  Overall, just wanted to give a shoutout to Naoemi for helping me out today! Thank you!

Really fun experience :) My friend and I went there and the main thing I came for was the macaron ice cream. It did not disappoint. The spring rolls were pretty good. My friend got the bun Bo hue and she said it was a bit greasy. The waiter made it a fun experience by asking us to take a Polaroid for the wall. Overall had fun and had a great dessert.

Definitely a huge fan. I absolutely love the ambience and setup. Their service was fast and amazing. They serve tea that comes in these cute little boxes and they give you a select variety. They also give you home made cornbread with butter.   I ordered the two meat platter which came with two sides. I ordered pulled pork and the baby back ribs. The ribs were probably the best I have tasted. I balanced the meal out with their grilled veggies and Mac and cheese on the side. Needless to say I was in the clean plate brigade that night.   For dessert, you really need to try the mud pie. Very generous portion to either share or just feed that sweet tooth for yourself.  Overall I'm definitely a fan :) :)

We initially came because of the really good deal on Groupon ($9.75 for $30 worth of dinner). However when we showed it to the waitress she told us we couldn't use it until 5 pm. (We came for the social hour between 3 to 6 pm). The patio was very open filled with tables. It was really a pleasant scene to behold with the fountain in the middle. At first our waitress was very attentive but after more people arrived her attentiveness waned significantly.  The happy hour menu food was delicious. Peasant paella was delicious with generous portions of protein variety (chicken, fish, sausage, and shrimp) Pernil tacos were pretty good as well (the chipotle mayo took the cake) The drinks were pretty good concept but I had varied feelings on the mixture  Blue Hawaiian needed a little mix but eventually was able to drink it  Guava mojito had no taste of guava The Jamaican Mai tai needed a bit more fruit flavor Dessert was delicious and plated with that  Fuego bistro insignia. Quite the presentation. Highly recommend it. Would return with groups :)

The Body Shop is literally what I use now because it helped me cure my skin problems with the Tea Tree Body Oil.  I'm brand new in town and I found this body shop in the Arrowhead Towne Center.  Shoutout to the manager there (I believe her name was Vanessa?) She did a fantastic job and was such a nice person.  She was so helpful as well. LOVE BODY SHOP! :)

Definitely was very satisfied with the service and the food. Our cocktails for happy hour were served very promptly with the accompanying chips which were delicious. The burger was juicy and you could tell it was no ordinary burger. The house made burrata was a nice display of tomatoes, salad and bread. The bread was really the perfect texture (not to hard or soft). The sweet Thai chile calamari was superb! Overall very satisfied!

UPDATE: I will definitely say that the workers and owner are not apathetic about what you think.  They also resolved the issue in a professional manner and apologized for the long wait. As a customer, I would say I am greatly satisfied with their service overall and will say that these mechanics are truly honest and number one in customer care and resolution.

First impression that we got was that the parking was a bit awkward. We had to park in the adjacent building then walk over. When we first arrived we didn't realize we had walked past the hostess desk because the hostess was away. We were seated immediately outside (per our request). We wanted to try the happy hour and got our drinks first. In my opinion they should have a separate menu for that time. The atmosphere and outside decor probably would have looked a lot better during the night. Definitely got my arm work out swatting away at flies and sweeping off the table from the overhanging pollen shedding trees. Our drinks were brought out to us in a timely manner. I got the Strawberry vodka drink and it was a little watered down. Definitely loved the escargot!!! Highly recommend it! The bruschetta was ok but not as flavorful or unique. Overall definitely would take my business there for happy hour or if I'm craving snails again!

Sushi is pretty good. Their service is ok. They were out of salmon eggs today and our waiter didn't offer us to order anything else. Presentation of the sushi was very nicely done. Overall cheap and tasty sushi. Good place for a quick lunch.

Really love coming here for sushi. Highly recommend get chirashi bowl. The service (even taking out) is amazing and efficient. Everyone is so friendly as well from the waitress to the sushi chefs. It is definitely amazing how attentive to detail everyone is despite how busy the place gets. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone :)

Brand new in town and my friend brought me here.  Literally fell in love at first sip with the House Special.  Great portions, nice environment, polite staff, and boba-tastic taste! Pretty much the best I've tasted :) :) :) :)

We actually came during lunch time right at opening. We had to wait at least 20 minutes for our order and almost an hour for our food. I am still waiting for my food because I don't think the waitress put in my order at all. The waitress didn't even come back and apologize. Worst service ever. The second star is being generous.

My friends and I tried out this place and it was pretty decent. Their TWC dry rub and their Siracha honey were our favorites. We also tried their garlic Parmesan and the atomic flavor. Sweet potato fries and the seasoned fries were pretty good as well. It is good that they provide a side of ranch.   Really big warning: the atomic flavor burns your lips. There is a reason why they have you sign a waiver. Your drinking cup of koolaid or water will become your best friend by the time you are done with that. Be prepared to get up and refill multiple times. Also be prepared to use that napkin dispenser like crazy. PSA: make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after handling the atomic wing. Do not rub your eyes unless you want a good half hour of that burning spicy sensation.

We came to postinos on a Friday night and had the worst service ever. We were seated but didn't get our waters until much later. Our waitress did not seem experienced and was not attentive at all. Worst service and will not be returning. Terrible first impression of a new location.

We were seated promptly and entertained by a one man show of hostess, bartender and waiter. Our waiter was a very polite young man who we decided to test in his bartending skills. He served us with a house cocktail called the Inferno Margarita which was jalapeño, liquor infused cucumbers and tequila. Definitely the best part of the meal. The bread served to us was unfortunately very dry and so dry that the accompanying oil did not help moisten it. We also got the pretzel and chorizo dip which was ok but not particularly remarkable. We also got the shrimp tacos which was also good but not particularly impressive. Overall will return for drinks but food needs to improve.

I think the best thing out of the experience there was the Diet Coke I opted to drink. My companions ordered different flavors of wings and we were highly disappointed. The wings were not exactly the best flavor and very very greasy. It also did not help that the wings were not practically priced. Felt nauseated after eating two of them. The waitress was friendly but it did take her a long time to even refill a drink. Not as attentive as I would have liked. Additionally I don't think they were expecting customers considering the trash can in the bathroom did not even have a bag. Overall, would not return
