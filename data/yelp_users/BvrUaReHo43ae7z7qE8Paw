The dr/vet was extremely unprofessional with the care of my dog and your reps absolutely mislead me when it came to your so called wellness plan. After my dog broke his leg you were the first place I took him. Unfortunately, your dr lied straight to my face, attempted to over charge me heavily for an exam alone, then proceeded to be overly abusive with not only my dogs broken leg, but my hesitation to pay almost $300 for some sedatives and X-rays. After consulting with other vets my eyes were opened to banfields negligent and unprofessional behavior. You guys seemed like a good choice. I now know you were nothing more that a giant piece of elephant poop wrapped in some delicious bacon and being served at extremely overpriced sums. In reality, your wellness plan is nothing more than a twice as expensive way of getting my puppy all of his shots that he needs. there is literally nothing else your wellness plan does for my dog other than give him his shots that he needs which I can get at any local vet for well under half the price you wanted to charge me. So of course I blocked you on my debit card. You're nothing more than a bunch of corporate scam artists and Petsmart should be embarrassed to have you guys as their vet. I mean seriously, how can you not be competitive with the rest of the vets prices in your area??? I wish I could've gave you -5 stars.

I've been eating sushi for 10 years and always disliked it but everyone else loved it.. But after eating here.. I've grown a new taste for the art of sushi. This place is amazing! So authentic they barely speak English and it shows in there food. Just imagine eating in Japan on your lunch break at a real spot. Don't delay, hit sushi kee today!

Come here pretty often and the drink service is always good, went today and the new bartender Linda was seriously on point. I'm very knowledgeable in the industry and honestly she is really good. You can tell by the angle of her pour . Not too strong, not too lite, just right. Place needs to add a stage in the corner for more late night activities but the food is when josh is cooking and the bar gm Jason is exactly what every bar should look for. Love coming here.

I love this place been going here since i was a little kid. not this location but barros. Anyway, I really love their pizza boat. however, it's the little things that really matter and this time not only was the guy on the phone abrupt and slightly rude but they forgot my stinking pizza sauce to dip my pizza boat in. It was literally the only reason I ordered. Also, i'm about a half a mile from the store and I have no idea why I would take an hour for delivery. Still love barros and will always go back.

I go here most Wednesday nights, they're only open Wednesday, Friday, Saturday. However, it's an awesome experience. Big dance floor, free two step lessons and a great atmosphere. All the bartenders are put on their own well and responsible for it, which can often lead under pouring. They definitely need to update their pos system to allow us to go to any Bartender, but that's probably years in the future. What this means is they force you "tab openers" to pick a bartender and stick with em. I recommend heather! Awesome attitude, perfect pours and very honest which is hugely appreciated. Also she's gorgeous! But don't excited, I think she's married. But regardless, the best bartender there. Recommend this place on those nights to all. And to all a goodnight!! Happy holidays everyone

Had dinner there tonight. Great atmosphere. Wanted to try their sushi but was once again sucked into the overwhelmingly fun promise of teppanyaki. Filet mignon and lobster set my carnal urges to rest. Thx Osaka

Mediocre at best. Wayyyy too salty. I ordered a chx quesadilla. Probably the easiest thing to make. The chx was dry, barely any cheese. The pico was fresh and good. But the guacamole was already brown. They have the windows painted so you can't see in. That scares me. They gave me one.. ONE! Red sauce. I need at least four for a quesadilla. I'll never eat here again. Oh yeah, and it was super expensive! Which is crazy since the place looks like a giant bucket of dung. I wish there was zero star choice

Went to Starbucks to see this amazing woman in my life right now, and on the way out I saw burgerfi. Didn't want a burger, just looked interesting. Walked in, it was nice, kinda hipster. Looked at the menu and decided to try one. Built my own, single patty, dbl mushroom, Swiss & cheddar, and garlic aoli... Lite Dijon. Got it to go. It was just under 10 bucks. Got home, opened the box and first thing I said out loud was "awwww.. It's a wittle baby burger." Then I took a bite..  (FIREWORKS!!) it was absolutely amazing, and worth every penny I spent. The burger was cooked nicely and the mushrooms were fresh and crazy delicious. Can't wait to go back.   Ps.. You should make red onion-onion rings

I've finally tasted the best fries topped with anything ever! The spicy green chili fries were amazing! Got the breakfast burger w/ over easy egg so the yoke could marinate the burger and it was like cocaine in the 80's.. AMAZING!!! Been bartending 13 yrs (8 as a master bartender) and their apple orchard mule was a perfect refresh for the taste buds. Prickly pear was a hair off. Normally prickly pear will hide the "alcohol" flavor of tequila and accentuate the actual flavor of the tequila itself. But 5 stars for sure! By far the best bar view in Gilbert. Super awesome spot. Thx zinburger

The food is really good. But that is all. The service is slow, delivery can take up to two hours (especially through grub hub). I tried to call the store but couldn't get an answer. So I was forced to use grub hub.. Cuz the phillies really are that good. This place just needs to learn how to better manage themselves. I stopped in about 3 weeks ago and they had run out of bread.. Yeah.. Bread.
