Food was amazing!  Our waitress Michelle did an awesome job. Will definitely be going back to eat there hopefully Michelle will be our waitress again.

Food was just okay. The fries were a little over cooked and the ketchup tasted gross. Hamburger was extra messy and the service was not that good. I ordered two hamburgers was charged extra for beef extra for bacon and thought I would try a beer. After all was said and done me and my wife spent over $40 bucks. Nothing against the place just not worth it!

They stay on the phone while cutting my kids hair other guy says he can't cut kids hair I have to wait for another guy. Then once finished haircut was on even. Customer service skills were terrible. The employees walked around like they had better things to do and they did not accept debit or credit. I'm calling this place last resort.
