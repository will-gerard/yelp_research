Being from just a little north of Philly, cheese steaks were a child hood staple.  I haven't any place any better than Forefathers for a good cheese steak (although I would be willing to try)  It's a quaint little place that doesn't go all out in decor, which is fine considering I'm used to some of the best cheesesteaks coming out of a cart.  They don't go all out in trying to impress you with the ambiance because they dump everything into what is most important, the food.  The sandwiches are incredible, and they offer a range of options and they are flat priced, $6.95 for a regular and $9.50 for a large.  The regular, with a side is a match for just about anyone.... want left overs or skipped a few days of eating then go for the large.  They offer salads and some other things, but I'm a meat and potato guy so I've never ventured passed the steaks and cheese fries.    All the subs are flavorly dressed just by themselves, but there are options for adding more, extra cheese, mushrooms, etc. (the add-on prices are very fair)  They brag that they aren't cheap on the meat and in their case, it is very true.  Plus the sandwiches are put together with perfect ratios so no one flavor is overwhelming another.  I also like that you can get sweet peppers, banana peppers, and other things like their "fry sauce" from a small fridge in the lobby... yeah, its open house, so no one looking down at you condescendingly when you grab a handful of pepper containers.  In the few times I've gone, I've learned my lesson, if you want to grab lunch during the work week, you've got to make it in by 1120am.... wait any longer and it gets packed quick.

Had dinner here and was concern because I was pressed for time and being winter, i expected it to be packed with winter visitors.  Surprisingly, for how good the food and experience, it wasn't busy at all for 5pm'ish on a weekday.  It's in a strip mall, so it kinda meet expectations for what it would look like.  The place is minimalist inside except for seating... but then again you are going to eat, not to look.   Cafe Laguna places its bet on Indian fry bread, and it pays off for its diners.  They actually fry up your bread right in front of you, so it's not sitting under a lamp... with that takes a bit more time than most " assembly line counter" places.  They've got entree fry breads and a few dessert fry breads as well ( that we sadly didn't have time or room in our stomach's to try).  I ordered the shredded beef (red sauce) classic.  The meat was very tasty and the sauce had a smoky flavor to it, that I enjoyed, though I would call it mild, maybe medium at best.  They add cheese, sour, chopped romaine, tomatoes and green onions as a standard.  It was very flavorful and the fry bread added some heft to the meal.  It's bout 10 bucks per person and with a normal appetite, you'll come away full.

Scott's expertise, in my opinion, is rarely matched.  Extremely thorough and professional are just part of the package.  Home Inspections are a necessary evil/cost in any real estate transaction and as a buyer you want someone who is thorough and meticulous, go no further than ACSI.

You can't beat the freedom and love that dogs receive here, it is easily a home away from home... but with more furry friends.

I've been using the closest national chain that accepts my insurance for as long as I can remember.  I figured it's just an eye exam and glasses, just about anybody with the right equipment can do that.  Then I stumbled upon Dr. Carlsson's and figured might as well support a local business.  I don't think I will ever go back to the "mall" eye centers.  I actually received good service from everyone at the place, and service isn't something you necessarily expect from a doctors office.  I didn't feel rushed like I was going through an assembly line and Dr Carlsson, actually took the time to explain what was happening with my eye health ( his words, not mine... eye health just sounds.... strange, but I can appreciate his professionalism and candor) rather then sending me off to the glasses display with prescription in hand.  The folks at the counter were nice and friendly and I really appreciate their sense of style, considering my own is lacking, and they didn't let me pick out a frame that was too small for my head... which I fully intended to until they stopped me with a "Those are nice..... but why don't you try these on."  I am really happy with my experience the only thing bad I would have to say is the place is pretty much a needle in a haystack, if you aren't referred directly or looking for them you probably won't find them.  They are in a small commercial development nestled in a residential area with no signage... which is a shame, because they really are a hidden gem amongst eye care professionals.

Cheryl and Ray are great.  As a small business owner I can appreciate the fact that thy don't have lot minimums and I can order one or two pieces at a time.  The quality is top notch to boot, highly recommended.

They just picked up direct to garment printing and I had a slew of shirts done.  As always, it was a pleasure to work with Ray and Cheryl and the finished product is phenomenal.  Clearly a better alternative to screen printing.

It is a weekly vice for me.  The goal was to try a new flavor every week, but I found a combination that suites me just fine and sadly I haven't been as adventurous as I had intended.  One of these days, I'll order something new, but until then I will enjoy the great flavor of my favorite drink and the mellow ambiance.

Had always seen this place while traveling the east valley for work and decided to finally give it a go.  It was about 230pm on a Friday afternoon.  Ordered myself a chili cheese dog.  The hot dog was great, Vienna Beef does give it a superior flavor and texture, bonus that it was in a natural casing.  However, that's about where the good experienced ended.  Everything that surrounded the hot dog quickly took away from the excitement and enjoyment of my lunch.  The chili was kind of flavorless and a little thin, which is why, I think, they drowned it in cheese.  I'm all about a messy dog... but it was all over the place, so much so, I had to eat it with a knife and fork. (it's a hot dog, not a stew)  But after eating the dog and then tackling the bun, I figured why they were so liberal with their cheese and thin chili, the bottom of the bun was hard.  I know I came in after the lunch rush, but a hard bun?  Really? That's the cheapest part of the package other than condiments, easy to toss without taking it on the chin.  Either they don't care or someone left the bag open after lunch and I got the tail end of the bag.  Not unforgiveable, but when you add it all up, it was disappointing.    I wouldn't not recommend it, but it's not a place I'd drive out of the way for.  But location wise, I don't think they intend on catering to the hot dog enthusiast as much as the kids from Red Mountain HS down the road.  Service was good, the place is what you expect from a strip restaurant and its clean.

It is a smidge out of my way, but with the money I save on printer ink it is definitely worth the drive.  As a small business owner, every penny counts.

Called at 1pm and they told me about 30 minutes.  I was back on the road and headin to get a new battery before the end of that window.  The owner came out and jumped my work truck.  It's always nice to see the face your money ends up going to.  Very friendly guy and wasn't stand offish like some folks in the auto industry can be.  He also gave me some advice about the battery model I should choose based off what I do with the truck.  Gotta appreciate that.

I fell for the hype.  Novelties like free peanuts and the new automated touch screen soda fountains, does not guarantee good food.  First the french fries.  They are not shoe string fries and shouldn't be advertised as such.  You expect a crispy fry because of the lack of thickness... these are only a smidge smaller than steak fries and with that, more soggy and less crispy.  You do get a boat load of them though.  Secondly, this is not fast food.  You sit and wait just like at a Fuddruckers.  Not having a wait staff to bring you your food does not make a fast food joint.  It's slower than IN and OUT, but faster than a Red Robin.  There seems to be a trend in them advertising things that they are not.  Maybe I'm spending to much time watching the food network, but if you are going to say something is a certain thing, it should be, yes?  I've got to agree with some of the other disappointed customers, the burgers are flat taste wise.  Having an extensive "condiment" list can't compensate for that.  The toppings pale in comparison to the quality you'd get on a double-double elsewhere.  I'm also pretty sure the grilled mushrooms are canned (try getting a grilled flavor out of something that is waterlogged)  Lastly 13 bucks for a bacon double, fries and a soft drink is not worth it.  Maybe being in Phoenix and having IN and OUT's for fresh burgers and Fatburger's for the expanded line of condiments (who doesn't love a fried egg on their cheese burger) just kinda spoiled me in that I can't see coming back.  Because 5 guys is kind of an expensive combination of the two, but does nothing better than them.  But hey, if free peanuts is your thing, have at it.

As the owner of Lights Out Exterminating periodically we run across scenarios where insects and plants meet.  Heather, a real horticulturist,  at Earth Smart Design is an invaluable resource for us to meet our clients needs without harming their landscaping and plants.  It is a relief to have someone in your pocket who is as passionate about their business as we are to ours.

If you are ever out in the Gold Canyon area definitely stop by, they have some very flavorful coffees and the iced coffee is magical.  They have a breakfast and lunch menu.    Although I haven't had anything of the b-fast menu, the lunch menu is great!  It's been my personal challenge to try all their sandwiches and paninis.  There are some really unique combination's, with the King's Ranch being my favorite: Genoa Salami, artichoke hearts, baby spinach and provolone on your choice of bread.  It is a very clean establishment and the decor is far above the chain coffee houses with art from local artists.  Friday night's they stay open later and have local entertainment for a few hours in the evening.

My wife returned a book that she ordered from Wal-Mart online.  She had the receipt and everything she needed for the return.  However when it was scanned in, even though the item was clearly marked on the receipt, the computer did not understand it and kept saying her book wasn't on the receipt.  It took over 15 minutes for a manager to come over and solve the problem.  You'd think a manager would be posted by the returns counter, by alas no, that would be logical.  Oh, and I don't know about just Wal-Marts in general, but there never seems to be any hot water in the bathrooms at the front of the store.

First off, I am not automotive inclined.  Sure I've got a mechanical background that deals with a combustion engine, but as soon as you put that engine on 4 wheels, I am absolutely clueless.  I met Doug, the shop's sales manager via my line of work and figured I would give them a shot next time I needed something done on my work truck.    I'm glad I did.    I'm a pessimistic person when it comes to things I know little about, so when you get your oil changed and they all of a sudden tell you that you need all this extra work, I tend to raise an eyebrow... but I get suckered in because I don't really know if what they are telling me is essential or just an upsell.  I didn't experience this here.  They did what I came to them to do and gave me some info about things I should watch out for, without the " you need this $250.00 discombobulator"  They answered all my questions without getting "pitchy" and I was on the road within an hour.  Price wise, I actually saved money, compared to what I usually pay, although they seem to be more oriented to an "appointment business model" than a walk-in "express".  Not that I was kept waiting, but just about everyone else who came in had an appointment.  I will definitely be back and as far as I am concerned they have my future business, not only for my business vehicles but my personal as well.  I dread going to the mechanics as much as the dentist, but now I've found a great group of people to tale my trucks to, without the condescending attitude and excessive upsell mentality that seems to plague the automotive repair industry.
