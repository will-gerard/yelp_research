After waiting 40 minutes patiently... Some girl who walked in 10 minutes after me and I both got called back for our turns. One lady started working on her while I proceeded to wait another 10 minutes. There's no organization and it is just ridiculous!!!! Will never come back EVER

This place rocks. I broke my phone in Chicago got it fixed at the UbreakIfix store there and then came to Arizona and cracked my screen and broke my top button. Very affordable and speedy service.

My first time at Dry Bar. Didn't know what to expect. But with complimentary drinks and cookies I was sold. They had iPhone chargers at each station which is critical for me. Leah did my hair and usually I go nowhere but to my usual girl because I have curly hair but she did a fantastic job and I will be back!
