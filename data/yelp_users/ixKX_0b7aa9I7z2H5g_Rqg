They charge an annual administrative fee that is not covered by insurance.  Basically, it's like a credit card annual fee.  This year 2012 it's $60.  I'm not one to pay annual fees at my bank, on credit cards, and definitely don't want to start at my doctors office :(  It's up to you though.

Hi All,  Just an update, 2/23/2013- I changed Drs because of the admin fee and the office is still trying to charge another "administration fee".  Soooo that pretty much means there is a bi-annual admin fee charged.  Was forced to pay the first fee because I was a patient, trying to get the most recent fee charged last month removed since I'm not their patient- patient beware, it's like a bad late night infomercial, "How do I cancel???!"  grrrrr

A group of us went to Geisha for Restaurant Week dinner last night and it was surprisingly really good!!   When I had heard of Geisha it was for the cocktails, music and people I had very little about their food however it was delicious and we will definitely go back to try other foods on the menu.  Our group had a couple different items they offered on the tasting menu however particularly the spicy pork dumplings and the sea bass were very YUMMY!  The sea bass came out piping hot which made it that much more tasty.  Also something to note, which is a HUGE compliment to Geisha ...they cleared the plates!!  Novel concept for some restaurants in Scottsdale.  Our server and the service staff made sure when we were done with a course to clear our plates quickly so we could chat and enjoy more cocktails- love that!  All the girls had the fried banana and green tea sundae...beautiful table presence, eh on the ice cream.  The fried bananas were AMAZING but the ice cream didn't taste like it had green tea flavor.  I would have been happy with a small scoop of more premium green tea ice cream rather than a big scoop of the blue bunny.  Fortunately the friend bananas were delicious so I would order it again just for those. If they had not been included in restaurant week I don't think we would have ever thought to eat there, overall it was very good .  The service was good, the food was hot and tasty, the atmosphere was fun and ladies don't forget to check out the restrooms ;)  and let folks know don't come in after you if you're gone for 20 min!

This is the best Segway Tour!!   You wanna know how I know...because I did this tour on 4/14 and had such a great time that when a Groupon came out for another segway tour in Tempe another friend and I bought it (since I raved about the tour in April).  Never the less, thinking Segway tour same/same right?  NOT same/same.  That's why I'm here writing an awesome review for Scottsdale Segway Tours with Todd and Becca 2 months later! Wowzer!  Todd and Becca have it together- from the training, the positive friendly attitude, laughs and engagement, having earphones (AND replacements if needed) so you can hear them telling history and stories.  PLUS at the end (after- not during the tour) they give a great little discount card and with your Segway 'badge' you can get discounts at restaurants and retailers.  Go ahead, try a new place in Old Town!  (or maybe your favorite place with 10%off your bill:) )  So that's all I can say- Scottsdale Segway Tour is THE best.  And don't get tricked it's VERY similar to another Segway Tour, remember...NOT same/same- worth the $$ for these guys:)

Whether it's called Segway of Tempe or Segway of Scottsdale it's not good.  Here's the deal- an out of town friend and I went on another companies Segway Tour in April and it was a blast- so when a Groupon came up for a Segway Tour (Segway of Scottsdale) I had so many great things to say about the other companies' Segway Tour that a friend and I bought the Groupon for the Tempe Tour with Segway of Tempe/ Scottsdale (whatever- they're the same)  Wow- not good, not same/same. Started 15 min late Training was poorly delivered  No headsets to hear the tour guide (she yelled back "There's the UsAirways building") No history/ story telling on the tour They stopped at Yogurtland for 20 min (wth?) Then ended early lol  Wowzer- really?!  I felt bad because I had told my friend that the Segway tour was soooo awesome, come to find out the Segway Tour with Scottsdale Segway Tours (with Todd and Becca) is  Sooooooooo AWESOME-   NOT same/ same (very close names, be careful) and while Scottsdale Segway Tours doesn't have a Groupon and may be a little pricier it's well worth it- just check them out on Trip Advisor - the #1 Activity.  (these guys, not so much) If you want more details on that Segway Tour you can check out the review I wrote for them.   While I don't like writing "not good" reviews at the same time it was that bad.  Hope it's helpful.

Sadly I had a very diappointing and poor experience with Christian from Salon X.  I arrived for my appt on time, however I had thought I would be 5 min late and left him a vm as a courtesy since this was my first visit.  Well, if you think you are going to be late - don't leave a vm.  When I arrived on time he did not greet me, I let him know who I was and filled out paperwork- and then sat for 25 min outside his station.  When he did have me come sit down, still no introduction, I showed him a picture of what I wanted.  With several short, rude comments and an "I'm too good for everyone" attitude he said there wasn't enough time- I advised him I'd been waiting for 25 min, which he said he had to listen to 15 messages, one of which was mine advising I'd be late.  I let him know it was a courtesy call jic and I was indeed not late.  I decided as a service oriented business I no longer wanted to do business with him and got up from the chair and left.  He is rude, impolite, and could only imagine how he would be if I didn't like a hair color or style- no thank you.  Horrible with clients

Great Spot!! Good friendly crowd, easy on the eyes too ;).  Not your 'Scottsdale' El Hefe or Scottsdale guys/girls crowd.  Non 21-25 year old crowd:). Have fun, be nice to door guys...bartenders, fair.

Went in for alignment & balance.  Polite & direct communication.  Which I appreciate.  When I left two new dashboard lights were on....?!?! Turned back around & drove back (thankfully I had the time right then). The front desk employee referred me to the Mgr.  Thankfully the Mgr had driven my car & remembered I didn't have any dashboard lights on when it came in so he took the car back.  They worked on it more (not sure exactly what was needed) but car came back out 45min later no lights. 30days later no issues. I appreciate them making it right but made me a little nervous that there was a new issue and thankfully the Manager had driven my car....not sure what would have happened if that wasn't the case that's why a 3 but overall service 4-5.  This was a toughy.   I will be taking a picture of my dashboard lights though going forward before it goes in though jic.   Ps. Decided to give a 4 because they fixed the issue without too much pushback.  Work with the Manager if you get pushback.
