What a great, locally owned family business!  This place has been in business for over 60 years!  Now that's impressive.  Cheese 'n Stuff is my "go to" establishment for lunch during the week.  I always order The Haturo, which is ham, turkey, roast beef, provolone cheese, onion, lettuce and mayo, with Italian dressing on a sub roll.  I have them replace the tomatoes with peppercinis, which helps to give it a little kick.  Now that I think about it, a small dose of tabasco would probably be good, too.  I usually eat my sandwich with some Tim's jalapeno chips (which I have to buy at Safeway) and a side of pasta or potato salad.  Their salads are great and affordably priced.  I have been trying to replicate a sandwich that reminds me of home and this is the only place that has been able to meet my high expectations.  The family is extremely nice and very good at what they do.  Cheese n' Stuff is one of the best businesses in the Valley.  They deserve your patronage.

Niccoli's isn't very close to my place of employment, but I decided to try it out for lunch.  I'm glad I did.  The interior is very inviting and cozy.  On my visit, there were only a few people inside, which made it nice and quiet.  I noticed a seating area for patrons who wanted to dine inside the deli.  There seemed to be some anxiety shared by the...  I assume they were the owners of the establishment - due to an employee not showing up for work.  They continued to apologize profusely for the situation.  Honestly, I was having a lovely time and felt absolutely at ease, despite their difficulties procuring help.  I finally received my meatball sub and took it back with me to the office.  I immediately noticed a difference with my sandwich and the meatball sandwiches I have become accustomed to.  Salumi's in Seattle places giant whole meatballs between two crusty pieces of Italian bread.  It is very hard to eat.  Niccoli's chops the meatballs up and combines them with their delicious sauce.  This makes it a lot easier to eat, especially since they use a softer type of bread.  However, it can get a little soggy if you allow everything to marinate too long.  Niccoli's is easily one of the best Italian delis in Arizona and it just happens to be owned and operated by two of the nicest people.

I am giving Casella's a 4-star rating, because as a native Washingtonian the lack of air conditioning was noticeable.  The fact that we drove from Goodyear to try their meatball sub sandwich created a shockwave of disbelief.    Good food is in short supply in Arizona.  Since there is nothing around the Goodyear area, I didn't mind driving 30 minutes to visit this place.  Everything about my sandwich gave the impression that the food was fresh and not greasy or stale, like Subway.  The bread was soft with a slight crispiness.  Although, a little flaky, it wasn't hard or tough.  The sauce and the meatballs were obviously created by hand and had not been frozen or left to sit for a long period of time.  Freezing meatballs can sometimes make them rubbery and tough, but these were pleasantly moist and appetizing.  The cheese that was included with the sandwich mixed well with the other ingredients and didn't overpower or distract from the overall enjoyment.  After discovering that we had driven from Goodyear, they invited us to sample some of their homemade salads.  Even though I was full of meatballs at this point, I agreed.  I am a meat and potatoes type of guy, but I can safely say that their salads are delicious.  I don't know what they put in them, but each salad was delectable and refreshing.    On those hot summer days, I would recommend the pasta or "healthy" salad.  Both were cool and light and would help to beat the heat, so to speak.  If you're looking for something more rich and hearty, I would recommend the chicken salad.  I am nowhere near a chicken salad expert or critic, but this stuff was pretty damn good.  The flavor was unique and satisfying and the chicken was tender and well-cooked.  For an establishment to be in business for over 35 years, it takes skill, expertise and, of course, great food.  Casella's exhibits all of these things.  It has a great family atmosphere and they make you feel like a long lost cousin.  Casella's Italian Delicatessen easily vies for the top spot in the Greater Phoenix area for Italian eateries.  Do not hesitate to visit.

I will gladly drive 40 miles from my house to Casella's for their food.  They have become my top stop Italian deli.  Recently, I tried their Italian and cheesesteak sandwiches.  Both were awesome.  I also love their salads.  I had the pasta and chicken salad.  The chicken salad receives my only small complaint, because it is a little too thick for my taste.  Maybe they need to ease up on the mayonnaise or something.  I don't know.  This place gets extremely busy around lunch time, but the service is quick.  Try to remember that they do not take debit / credit cards or checks.  Cash is king.  The Casella family is like a well-oiled machine: dad runs around, making sure everything is orderly and clean, while mom and the daughters handle cooking, food prep, and the front counter.  I simply love this place....even more than DeFalco's.

This is a very busy place on Friday nights and they don't seem to be capable of making the proper adjustments to adequately serve large numbers of customers.  The service was generally slow and inattentive, though it did improve once they became aware of us.  There is also an unrealistic expectation that patrons will automatically know to seat themselves upon arrival.  I have nothing good to say about their food.  Their carne asada burrito was bland, watery, and unappetizing.    Their chile relleno made me gag.  It was by far the worst.  The chile itself was hard and difficult to chew and I had to spit out the seeds.  The taste was disgusting.  I pushed it aside immediately after choking down the first bite.    The chicken enchiladas were extremely dry and tasteless.    I literally left half a plate full of food uneaten.  Our waitress kept asking if I needed a box, to which I repeatedly declined.  Their only saving grace is the chips and drinks.  My margarita was fine.  No complaints.  In sum, if you want to punish yourself and have a miserable experience, eat at this restaurant.

Wow, this place looks bad!  The parking is horrendous and the restaurant is located in an extremely shady looking strip mall.  I walk in and it looks equally as shady and crappy as the exterior.  However, we ordered our food "to go" and it was waiting for us when we arrived.  There was a nice woman behind the front counter taking orders and handling transactions.  I was surprised when I saw the size of my Italian combo sandwich.  It was freaking huge!  I only managed to eat half of it.  My only complaint is that their cannolis weren't very good and the powdered sugar spilled inside my car.  I would definitely recommend this place.  They make some of the best sandwiches I have had since moving to Arizona.

Excellent location!  I have been to this establishment a few times and would recommend sitting outside, because the interior gets a little noisy.  If you experience high wait times, just walk around the neighborhood!  There is a nice bakery nearby, as well as a little coffee shop.  While I'm not a fan of their biscuits and gravy, the pancakes keep bringing me back.  Their pancakes are infused with a lot of flavors and the portions will fill you up fast.  Prices are somewhat affordable, but a family of 4-5 can easily rack up a $60 bill.  Don't hesitate to visit.  This is one of the best breakfast joints in Phoenix.

My first visit to Defalco's did not live up to my expectations.  Ordering food at the counter is sufficiently quick and orderly.  Though, I had to ask how I was going to receive my food, because there is nothing to imply they will deliver it to your table.  I guess they simply remember your face or something.  Within a few minutes, my order was delivered to my table outside on the patio, but I still had to convince the young man that, yes, I ordered a half meatball AND a half cheesesteak.  Sheesh.  Don't judge me!  The sandwiches come with a small pepper on the side.  Both were very good, but I have some complaints.    The meatball wasn't as warm as I would have preferred and the bread they use makes their sandwiches difficult to eat, especially the meatball.  The bread they choose to use is big, flaky, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, Italian bread.  I don't like it.  I hate trying to maneuver my mouth around a sandwich that is obviously too big, so my only choice is to flatten, mold, and manipulate the bread to where it is edible.  Doing this invariably creates a meatball mess, because the bread is not properly designed to contain meatballs and marinara sauce.  Though, cutting it up into smaller portions seemed to work.  The cheesesteak was delicious, but the one-note, repetitive flavor became overwhelming towards the end.  I think it was the cheese they use.  It overpowers everything else and diminishes all of the other elements to an imperceptible degree.  I couldn't even taste the onions and green peppers.  The meat was also barely perceptible.  Too much cheese, I guess.  Though, I did appreciate the fact that I could squish the cheesesteak without making a mess, which was the complete opposite of the meatball.  Overall, Defalco's is still a great place, but personally I prefer Casella's.

I have had pizza all over the West Coast and Pizzeria Bianco is absolutely, without a doubt one of the best.  The service was quick and attentive and left nothing to be desired.  The staff at Pizzeria Bianco operate like a well-oiled machine.  Due to the pricing - which is a few dollars more than what you would normally expect - we decided on the Margherita pizza and I selected a Peroni to wash it down.  Within a few minutes our pizza was delivered and we dug in.  Halfway into our meal, Chris Bianco wandered in through the back and I instantly became star-struck.    I tried to snap a quick picture of him, but he caught me and instead of embarrassing me any further simply engaged us in a short, delightful conversation.  I informed him that this was our first time visiting and after explaining to him where we were from (Olympia/Seattle, Washington) he proceeded to compliment the Pacific Northwest.  Since I am a fan of Chris Bianco, this made a huge impression on me.  I always try to aspire to greatness and am particularly attracted to people who are culinary rock stars.  Some can be arrogant, snobby, and disinterested, but Chris was none of these things.  The guy was completely laid-back, down-to-Earth, relaxed, friendly, humble, and had such a pleasant personality that put us at ease.  All of the qualities you would expect in an excellent entrepreneur and host.  Our pizza was also a pleasant surprise and actually exceeded my expectations.  Thin crust pizzas are difficult to cook evenly and are often burnt or too soft.  This margherita pizza was perfect.  It wasn't too soft or overcooked.  I have also noticed that some restaurants have a difficult time balancing various flavors and that many serve pizzas that overpower you with saltiness.  Somehow Pizzeria Bianco is able to balance the ingredients perfectly.  They blend the saltiness of the sauce with the mild rich and savoriness of the cheese and dough so that it pairs excellently.    The difference between their competitors is night and day due to the quality of their ingredients and professional expertise.   Pizzeria Bianco is hands-down the best pizza restaurant in Arizona and quite possibly the entire West Coast.  Despite limited seating, I highly recommend Pizzeria Bianco for all types of pizza lovers.  Just try to arrive early (around 4:00 PM) if you don't want to wait for a table.

Nice, little lunch spot....by Arizona standards.  The outdoor seating area is relaxing, provided that it isn't 1,000 degrees outside, but keep in mind that you will constantly be harassed by a multitude of flies.  It's disgusting and ruins the experience.  The service can be hit-or-miss, but most of the time it is adequate.  They lose a few stars when compared to Fired Pie.  Cibo doesn't seem to cook their pizzas long enough, which makes the interior soft, squishy, and unappetizing.  That is a pet peeve.  Cibo is also more expensive.  Why?  Who knows.  I paid $10.00 for a single topping "lunch" pizza.  At Fired Pie, you pay around $8.50 for the same size w/ unlimited toppings.  In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have gone to Cibo for lunch.  Haha.

Flies for lunch.  Mosquitoes for dinner.  If you want flies landing on your food or if you want to be bit by mosquitoes while you eat, then I highly recommend you visit Cibo.    ...also, the service royally sucks.  They will change servers on you in the middle of your meal.

Visiting from Washington State.  I heard this place was good, so I took my mom to Olive and Ivy for lunch.  I ordered the turkey grinder and she ordered a salad.  The salad looked good, but I immediately distrusted the grinder they made for me.  The taste was all wrong.  It was very sour, like someone had dumped a ton of vinaigrette all over it.  The bread was way too hard, almost comically so, making it impossible for anyone to eat the damned thing without exerting a reasonable amount of effort.  After a few bites, I became astutely aware that my mouth was bleeding from the razor-like bread slicing into my gums.  I refused to eat anymore and sent my lunch back.  The manager graciously offered to pay for our lunch, due to the fact that their food had actually made me bleed.  Receiving a free lunch was nice, even though I left the establishment hungry and bleeding.  Although, I'm certain my mother enjoyed her experience, I certainly didn't.  I will not be returning to Olive and Ivy, due to the obvious lack of common sense exhibited by the people making the food, the people checking the food for abnormalities (like dangerously hard breads), and the management for their lack of oversight and ability to properly analyze their product.  Serving the right bread should be easy.  Unfortunately, Olive and Ivy made it look very difficult.  Any restaurant that fails so heavily on such mediocre and simple issues should be shunned and avoided.

I ordered a chicken bowl w/ noodles and spicy teriyaki sauce.  There really was no vegetable variation, other than a couple pieces of broccoli and a large sum of zucchini slices.  The teriyaki sauce was good, but the chicken resembled the disgusting frozen meat that is packaged in frozen dinners from Safeway.  Gross.  The noodles were NOT noodles.  When I order noodles, I am expecting a type of island or Asian noodle.  What I received was spaghetti pasta.  WTF!?  I thought this place was called Rumbi ISLAND Grill, not Olive Garden!  Inexcusable.  I threw the entire thing away, which cost me around $10, because apparently spaghetti pasta costs more than rice!  What a terrible restaurant.

I went here with my mother.  It was our first visit.  I was not prepared for the buffet dining style.  It took me by surprise.  The place was fairly small and there was a heavy crab leg/seafood aroma in the air.  I ordered the all-you-can-eat hotdog option for $8.99 and my mom order a single specialty dog for about $1.90.  Why is this place so cheap!?  I tried a Nathan's hotdog, followed by a Hebrew National, and then a jalapeno brat.  I was also provided with a side of onion rings and tater tots.  For dessert, we dined on some soft serve ice cream.  I ate WAY too much.  The food wasn't bad.  I don't really have anything to complain about, but something about the place made me nervous.  I think it was because there is an extreme amount of disarray.  My mind needs order and I was trying to make sense of the chaos around me.  I am also not accustomed to buffet restaurants.  All-in-all, not a bad little place.  Try it at least once.

Mr. G's is now under new management.  I don't know why.  The menu has changed.  The service has changed.  The food has changed.  They had a good system and now it is pretty bad.  I won't go back and fully expect this place to close in the near future.

Just not very good.  My chili omelette wasn't very good.   The potatoes weren't very good.  The sausages seemed like they were under-cooked.  The biscuits and gravy were mediocre and the eggs my mom ate were too greasy, which made her sick.  I love breakfast and have been to quite a few places.  Unfortunately, Egg Works doesn't really come close to being a quality establishment.  I can easily think of 5 breakfast restaurants that serve better food.  Unfortunately, none of those restaurants are in Las Vegas.

There is something fishy going on here.  I suspect this dentist provides some sort of reduction in cost or some other benefit in exchange for a 5-star review from his clients.  He is essentially trying to game the system.  At any rate, I had an appointment at 10:30 and arrived a few minutes before.  They had me sign a few forms and then made me wait about 20 minutes until somebody took me back.  When I initially made the appointment, I said that I wanted to get my teeth cleaned.  Instead what happened, is that all of my teeth were x-rayed, counted, poked and prodded.  A dental assistant explained to me what she had found, then the doctor came around to tell me his thoughts.  Then they said, "Thanks!," gave some toothpaste and a toothbrush and told me to wait in the lobby again until somebody was ready to coordinated further appointments with me.  When I speak to someone at a dentist office and tell them I want my teeth cleaned, I have a reasonable expectation that my teeth be cleaned before I leave.  I consider my time and money to be valuable and any business that does not feel this way about my time and money will not be given a positive review.  I wasted over an hour getting my teeth x-rayed at Central Valley Dentistry, because I will not be returning.  In the future, I would recommend that they do what the client requests and instead move the x-rays to the second appointment or split it up into multiple appointments.  A few years ago, I went to a dentist in Avondale and immediately got my teeth cleaned, so don't give me that bullshit excuse about how you need to get your teeth x-rayed first.  In addition, My dentist in Washington State informed me that Central Valley Dentistry took too many unnecessary and redundant x-rays of my teeth, essentially billing my insurance provider twice for the same thing.  He informed me that insurers in Washington would not pay for this sort of thing.  You have to ask yourself: why would a dentist office take unnecessary x-rays and push back a requested teeth cleaning to another day?  This office is clearly trying to squeeze more money out of their clients.

No cheese?  WTF!  Since the only selections seemed to change the size and number of the burger patty, I assumed cheese was included.  Nope!  Traditional Lucky Boy or International Lucky Boy.  These are basically your only options.  Tell me why I paid over $5.00 for a undercooked, mediocre burger with a small amount of lettuce and pickles.  I also ordered the onion rings, but they proved to be mediocre as well.  Since I don't make a habit of eating pink, undercooked meat this means that I wasted my time and money to drive to Lucky Boy to eat some nasty onion rings for lunch.  Awesome.  I'm beginning to think that it really is an unreasonable expectation that somebody in this f**king town knows how to make some decent food.  *sigh*  In addition, I wasn't able to use my debit card, because their machine was broke.  So, now if I need some cash I have to make an extra trip to the bank.  Thanks again, Lucky Boy, for a great experience from a first time customer.

Prepare for an engaging experience at the Hero Factory.  The owner of this establishment is fueled by mass quantities of piss and vinegar.  My mother referred to her as "spunky."  I'm still not sure what I would label her personality:  maybe "lively" or "energetic?"    Despite the Jersey attitude, she is very nice and accommodating.  I ordered a sub that consisted of a chicken filet, bacon, cheddar cheese, and bbq sauce.  My mother ordered the Italian...or something that resembled an Italian sub.  Both were reasonably priced and adequately sized.   The Italian was packed full of meat and the bread they use soaked up the oil and juices nicely.  My chicken was crunchy, but not too tough, and blended well with the mixture of bbq sauce, bacon, and melted cheese.  I couldn't finish the whole thing and took half of it home.  We also ordered a cup of split pea soup, which was very tasty.  It wasn't too thin or too thick and had chunks of ham and carrot floating around in the murky depths.  I would order it again.  I am originally from Washington State.  In Seattle, the Mayor has declared downtown businesses as "gun free" and encourages owners to deny service to any patron who happens to be legally carrying a gun.  At the Hero Factory, the owner carries a gun.  Personally, I didn't mind, but I found the juxtaposition to be humorous and intriguing.   In sum, I will be returning to the Hero Factory, because they serve great food and their owner is an interesting character.

Wtf!?    Who puts disgusting, processed American cheese on a sub sandwich!?  Every time I go back to this place, it gets worse.  For...the...love...of...God...  This is why I'm scared to go out for lunch in Phoenix.  Nobody seems to have a clue about what you should and shouldn't do.  Also, the bread.  Why choose a bread that has millions of tiny sesame seeds?  Hmm?  No bueno.  Hey, Hero Factory, the 80s called.  They love your cheese.  The rest of us, not so much.  I paid about $11.00 for this awesome sub and a small bag of chips.  If you appreciate it when people flaunt their right to wear a gun in public, then this is the place for you.  However, if you want some decent food, I would avoid the Hero Factory.  They get 2-stars for quick service and good jalapeno potato chips.

I walked in and wanted to get some sushi to go.    Instead, I stood at the door for about 10 minutes until somebody was told to come out of the kitchen and help me.  Unfortunately, I don't believe in giving a business my money if they don't appreciate my service.  The food might be okay, but the service is terrible.  Pretty depressing considering the lack of options in the West Valley.  *sigh*

Terrible ordering system.  It is beyond idiotic.  Similar to Chipotle where you go down the line, except much, much worse.  I simply wanted a sandwich and some soup, but that proved to be too difficult for the superb employees at this Paradise location.  I'm not even too upset about the fact that they didn't have the soup I originally wanted.  That's understandable, since I arrived at 8:00 PM after working out at the gym.  However, I did have a reasonable expectation that someone would actually make a sandwich for me.  Unfortunately, this did not happen.  I stood there at the cash register with a cup of soup and waited and waited.  Seeing as how it appeared as though nobody would be fulfilling my order that night, I decided to cancel it and go somewhere else.  I wish my problem with Paradise ended there, but it didn't.  After a few days passed, I looked at my checking account and they had only reimbursed me for my sandwich, rather than the entire soup + sandwich order that I was charged for.  So, now I need to contact Paradise customer service and try to get $4.40 back.  What a pain in the ass.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this location.

Extremely busy Friday night.  We had reservations for a party of 10, but that didn't seem to matter very much.  After waiting for about 15-20 minutes passed our reservation, we were finally squeezed into two small tables.  The manager was very apologetic and provided us with free appetizers.  The serving staff also accommodated us by providing a third table a few minutes after we sat down.  Overall, the food wasn't inspiring, but it was adequate.  At this point, we all know what to expect when we go to Olive Garden.  However, in this case, the staff and the management really stepped up their game.  We were continually bombarded by service and asked if we were doing well or if we needed anything.  While the food may be mediocre, the people working here certainly are not.  In fact, they all deserve to be paid more for putting up with my crazy relatives.  On another positive note, the triple chocolate whatever cake was awesome!

Recently moved from Washington State and decided to go here with my mom.  We heard good things, so what the hell.  It couldn't be too bad, right?  Well...  We kept it simple and only ordered a few appetizers: fried egg rolls and chicken satay.  The egg rolls reminded me of what I would find in a cheap Chinese restaurant and the chicken satay was dry, tough, and overcooked.  I can only assume that people around here must not know what good Thai food tastes like.  We won't be back.

I took my grandparents here and they absolutely loved it.  Papa Ed's is a relaxing, little hidden gem in Glendale's historic district.  The business is nestled inside an attractively decorated guest house or shop in the backyard of what I assume to be the home of the owners.  The proprietors are very nice and accommodating even minutes before they are scheduled to close.  The little gardens reminded us of home in the Pacific Northwest and their shady trees helped provide us with a much needed respite from the sun.  I would love it if they made some really good milkshakes, but it didn't look like they offered any.  They were also out of some flavors, but that's okay.  The ice cream was delicious, which made the experience more enjoyable.

Thanks, a-holes, who gave this place 5 stars.  I just drove out to the sticks and wasted $14.00 for one of the worst burritos I have ever had (took one bite and gave it away), greasy, unsalted cheese fries, and bland, watered-down horchata.  I can sum up Gordas Baja Taco in three words:  Awful, awful, awful.  This restaurant is actually worse than Taco Bell.  I cut the burrito in half and it fell apart, because it only consisted of dry rice and undercooked pink chicken.  I am forcing myself to eat these disgusting French fries, because I am hungry and didn't feel like getting food poisoning from the gross burrito they gave me.  The only thing I have to wash the horrible taste out of my mouth is their water-horchata.  Blech.  This must be what they serve people in Hell.  If you are smart and actually like GOOD food, stay away from this place.

To date, I have only been satisfied with one out of three Arizona dentists that I have visited.  Estrella Falls Dentistry was not one of the offices that provided satisfactory service.  If you are accustomed to having dentist offices say "no" or "we can't," then you will probably love this place.  Everything was fine, until I was told that they would not clean my teeth until I agreed to sit through a 2-hr deep cleaning, cavity repairs, and at least 4 appointments that would cost me over $300 in out-of-pocket expenses.  The "deep cleaning" would only involve cleaning my bottom two wisdom teeth and would need to be split up into two, 1-hr appointments.  I only visited this office, because I was lead to believe that they were going to clean my teeth on the next visit like I asked.  Unfortunately, this was not the case.  I will not become a client of a dentist if I do not trust them and I do not trust the intentions of Estrella Falls Dentistry.  The impression I received is that they will only listen to their clients after multiple visits and after they receive hundreds of dollars in out-of-pocket payments.  This is bad business.  I wasted my time and money yet again and still wasn't able to get my teeth cleaned.  If you have an incredibly busy and hectic schedule like I do, then you don't have the time to repeatedly leave work for dentist appointments.  I never knew finding a good dentist would be this difficult.  The search continues...

To make matters worse, this office will not return your calls.  I have left a message multiple times and have never received a response.  They billed my insurance company for x-rays, but will drag their feet or completely ignore requests to have your x-rays forwarded to another office.  It is so bad that I have been forced to leave work early, just to be sure that I get there before they close, in order to have them send the x-rays that I own to a better dentist.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  Why anyone would put up this this nonsense is beyond me.  I highly recommend looking for a different dentist, because there are plenty of them in the Valley.

After walking around, we were pretty hot and tired and decided to try this pub that happened to be nearby.  Fortunately, it was happy hour!    When Todd's says $3 Sliders, they really mean $3 for one Slider.  One...little...burger.  What a deal.  And, when Todd's says $1 for wings, they really mean $1 for one wing.  One...little...wing.  What a steal.  On a positive note, the beer and wine was 1/2 off.  I got drunk on something called "mead" and my mom seemed to enjoy her strawberry-whatever beer.  In sum, go to Todd's for their selection of alcoholic beverages, but keep in mind that the food is mediocre and overpriced...much like the rest of Las Vegas.

Damn good (albeit, expensive) food and drinks.  We tried the onion rings and fondue dessert.  I ate everything and felt like I was going to pop.  I just wish that my "Satisfaction" drink was in a bigger glass.  I finished it in two sips and felt like I got ripped off.  At almost $15, the drink definitely should have been bigger.  For something that claims to be satisfying, it clearly wasn't.  For dessert, we ordered the "Sharing" fondue for $25.  I highly recommend you do the same.  It was a fun experience and made Las Vegas more memorable.

Went here for the first time, because of the high rating.  I decided to compare the California burrito to Senor Taco's version.  The burrito Pancho serves is smaller, but slightly better.  I wasn't very impressed with the carne asada or how they made the burrito.  Maybe burritos are not considered authentic Mexican food?  I don't know.  I'll probably order something different next time.  The horchata I received was also smaller than what Senor Taco offers.  I love horchata and always want A LOT OF IT!  Overall, a decent place.  It is run by nice people who appear to be genuinely concerned about your experience,

At the Brat Haus, I like their beer more than their food.  They have a great selection of beers and some nice German options, too.  The food, however, is either average or subpar.  First, I wanted to order a variety of their sliders, but was told that I had to choose one variation.  Why?  They give you four sliders, so just charge me $10 or whatever and let me select a combination of BLT, beef, and green chile chicken!  Bastards...  Since my first request was denied, I decided to order The Pig Mac with bacon and an egg.  The Pig Mac is a double cheeseburger with a pork sausage patty, a ground beef patty and the usual filler.  It was enormous, messy, and a chore to eat.  Even after squishing it down, I still couldn't fit my mouth around this thing.  I was forced to chop it up into smaller pieces and then had to daintily eat around the pink or undercooked parts of the pork patty.  I didn't get sick afterwards, so I guess I will survive, but I really, really, REALLY hate eating pink meat.  It would have been nice if they allowed their customers the ability of choosing how they want their meat cooked.  Brat Haus had just cooked a pig, so a couple people in my party decided to try that.  It didn't look very good and one guy even stopped eating it.    This guy requested some crispy skin and about 15-20 minutes later they brought out some "chicharrones."  I have never tried this stuff and I am glad I haven't, because I wouldn't have any teeth left.  I took a little bite and nearly chipped a tooth...and it tasted awful.  Blech.  Who eats this stuff?  Really the only thing that they did well was the beer and a nutella milkshake that I ordered.  Please God don't have my friends take me to this place again...

Rehab is one of the best burger establishments in Maricopa County.  I ordered some type of cheeseburger with thousand island dressing.  It was extremely messy and difficult to eat due to the thickly sliced pickles, but cutting it up made it easier to handle.  Some little sweet potato tots came with my burger and I also ordered a side of onion rings.  The onion rings were in my top 5.  No complaints there.  They automatically bring you ketchup, ranch, and a chipotle sauce for dipping.  Way to be on the ball, Rehab.  The sweet potato tots came with a yummy pineapple concoction for dipping.  It was good at first, but quickly became too sweet and I had to abandon it for the ranch and ketchup.  Everything was really good.  I would definitely go back.  Even their female employees were easy on the eyes.  Apparently, they are allowed to wear tight, revealing clothing to work.  Again, no complaints there.  In sum, go to Rehab if you like cute girls and awesome burgers.

I dislike their ordering system.  It is redundant and illogical.  You order a sandwich and then have to answer questions from three different people:   1.  "What kind of bread do you want?"  2.  "What sandwich did you order?"  3.  "What do you want on your sandwich?"  4.  "Is that all?  Your order comes to $x.xx"  JUST GIVE ME A F**KING SANDWICH!!!  I should not be forced to jump through all of these hoops in order to buy a simple sandwich!  This is not a specialty or gourmet meal.  Slap some meat and cheese between two slices of bread and give it to me.  I walked out of Potbelly with a strange sense of deja vu.  Oh, that's right.  I have already been here when it was called Quiznos!  One more thing:  your Zapp's potato chips suck.  "Hotter 'N Hot Jalapeno" my ass.  These are the worst potato chips I have ever had.  In sum, Pobelly serves mediocre sandwiches, bad chips, and has a stupid ordering system.   Most businesses want to stand out, whereas Potbelly just wants to be like Quiznos.   This was my first and last time in a Potbelly restaurant.

I have never really been to a "panaderia" before and was pleasantly surprised by Panaderia La Central's products.  I went around and selected at least one of everything they had to offer. All of them were de-li-cious.  There is a European bakery back home that I visit for their éclairs and cinnamon bread.  I can easily spend $40 at that place.  After I had grabbed a bunch of turnovers, empanadas, and a multitude of other pastries the girl behind the counter rang them up and said $23.00!  This place is SO cheap!  Don't miss out on this place!  It is awesome.  Everybody in the West Valley needs to make Panaderia La Central their first choice for Mexican pastries and cakes.

I want to move closer to this place, so I can go everyday!   This stuff is SO f**king good!  I had no idea what to order so the owner gave me about 6 little sample cups of different flavors to try.  All of them were delicious and only made my decision more difficult.  In the end, I think I decided on the boysenberry, apricot, and some green stuff called Li Hing Mui.   There are so many flavors that I could have spent at least 20 minutes trying to decide, if I hadn't received help from the owner, who is extremely nice and friendly.

I don't make a habit of giving businesses 5-stars if they don't deserve it.  However, in this case, Snoh Ice Shavery deserves every star.  I have made it a tradition of visiting this business every Friday to start the weekend off with a bang.  It is the opposite direction of my house and I usually get stuck in traffic, but it's worth the trouble.  I have been here 3-4 times now and have ordered something different every time.  All of it was good.  I don't know what I'm ordering half the time, but I am always pleasantly surprised by the flavors and quality of ingredients.  Dang it.  I wish I didn't reside in the West Valley.  Just writing this review is making me hungry for more.

Noisy.  Limited menu.  Controlled chaotic restaurant environment.  Took forever to get a table, so we left.  Went to the Breakfast Club in Scottsdale.  Nice location, seating outdoors, and food that rivals Matt's.  No longer have any reason or desire to go back to Matt's.

I finally gave Short Leash another try.  I was on my way to the airport one morning and needed to get some breakfast/lunch.  Originally, I was planning on going to Matt's, but (of course) it was extremely busy and chaotic.  Since Short Leash was only a few blocks away, I decided to give them a shot.  What a mistake that was.  First of all, why does it feel like they have no air conditioning?  I'm always so f**king hot in this place.  Blah.  When I'm eating food, I don't like to be sweating.  I wanted to try a few of their breakfast items, so I chose their version of breakfast dogs, which is essentially brats/sausages dipped in batter and deep fried.    This dish came with a tiny thimble of maple syrup and a European espresso cup filled with fried, crispy home fries.  I didn't mind that they were nearly unrecognizable due to being overly fried.  They were seasoned well and adequately compensated for the miserable breakfast corn dog.    When I bit into the "breakfast dog," it immediately began to separate into two unique meals: an unappealing and seemingly undercooked, pale brat/sausage and a soft, pancake-like batter that had been deep fried until it loosely wrapped itself around said meat-on-a-stick.  Blech.  They serve you two of these things for about $8.00.  I took a few bites and decided that the remainder should deservedly be tossed in the garbage.  For the second item, I chose their version of "chicken and waffles," which is a misleading title, because it doesn't represent the traditional meal.  Instead, Short Leash serves you a large, dense waffle that has been daintily topped with minuscule amounts of syrup and butter, sliced in four separate pieces, and arranged messily next to a fried habanero chicken sausage.  With this dish, I enjoyed the chicken sausage, though it was a little too spicy.  Why the hell would anyone think that it's a good idea to put habanero peppers inside a sausage?  Why not just keep things simple and flavorful?  When I'm eating breakfast, I don't want to feel like I am participating in a spicy foods contest.  The waffle was another story.  To put it bluntly, it was awful.  It was everything you don't want a waffle to be: thick, dense, heavy, rubbery...   It would have served as an excellent flotation device, because it didn't appear to be capable of soaking up ANY liquid, creating miniscule pools of butter and syrup on the surface.  Meanwhile, the waffle just smugly sat there on my plate, daring me to take another bite.    Fortunately, I prevailed and resisted further attempts to digest this seat cushion.  Honestly, folks, I don't know why you like this place.  Nothing about it is enjoyable, except for the cute waitress.  It's overpriced, the food is mediocre, and the interior temperature is always at an uncomfortable level.  Why keep going back here and continue giving this place rave reviews?  Obviously, I don't get it, but I'm not going to punish myself anymore.  These Dogs should definitely be kept on a Short Leash and not allowed to roam free, unleashing their disastrous culinary creations on unsuspecting patrons.  A sign should be posted out front that reads: "Beware of Dog."

I can make any pizza I want?  Yes, please.  I swear these guys stole this idea from Kramer, who wanted to open a restaurant where people could make their own pie, but whatever, I'm not complaining.  It actually works.  I was trying to think of a reason why Fired Pie shouldn't receive 5-stars, but I couldn't come up with anything.  The process is relatively quick and painless and your pizza is ready within a few minutes.  For about $8.50 (with tax), this pizza is awesome.  In fact, the quality and taste is almost equal to popular establishments like Pomo Pizzeria, Cibo, and Federal Pizza.  I absolutely love the fact that I can design whatever pizza I want and add extra toppings for no additional fee.  If you want a quick, affordable, delicious experience, I highly recommend Fired Pie to sate your hunger for pizza.

Food is decent.    The tater tots are particularly good.  Beer is pretty good, too.  However, I don't agree with their smoking policy.  If I want to sit outside, I should be able to sit wherever I want and not have to inhale second-hand cigarette smoke.  The Vig is now officially boycotted and I will schedule all of my business meetings elsewhere.

Extremely nice people who operate this business, particularly "Dan" who runs the front of the restaurant.  Due to a slight difficulty one day, Dan offered me a free water (due to the heat) and 50% off my next burrito.  This is great customer service.  I didn't even ask or expect this level of compensation.  It simply appeared to be a natural or automatic response to a small customer inconvenience.  The interior is clean and simple, with ample room for dining.  I have been here a few times now and can safely say that I am a fan.  Their "special" carne asada burrito is nicely flavored and has a multitude of little, succulent pieces of properly prepared steak.  I also enjoyed the breakfast burrito, which consists of eggs, potatoes, cheese, and choice of meat.  While not the best I have ever had, they certainly keep me returning for more.  Overall, PHX Burrito House should be applauded for having outstanding customer service and their ability to make a damn good burrito.

I think I'm the only white person who knows about this place.  Everything seems to be written in Spanish.  I don't understand the menu or what people are eating and saying, but the drinks they make are awesome.  I guess they are called "raspados?"  I still don't know what that means.  Anyway, I highly recommend you stop by for a visit.  I have been here multiple times.  The quality of their products and excellent customer service is always consistent.

...and now they make bacon-wrapped hot dogs!?  I'll take 10, please and thank you!  I guess I was a little late to the hot dog party, so to speak.  I wish I had known sooner.  Zaipi's is now my go-to place for cheap, kick-ass hot dogs.  In my opinion, these guys make a much better hot dog than Short Leash in Phoenix.  You can go here and pay $2.50 for a superior product or you can go to Short Leash Hot Dogs and pay $10.00 for a mediocre product.  It's not a difficult decision.

Okay, so, I'm a fan.  I finally managed to pick a day when there wasn't a line out the front door.  The first time, I ordered some food to go:  chicken, sausage, tater salad, and slaw.  The only thing I would recommend you avoid is the coleslaw, which was bland.  It had an awful flavor and similar consistency of cabbage that has been left outside in the rain, chopped up, and mixed with watered-down salad dressing.  Overall, I enjoyed my first experience.  Keep in mind, that it may take you a few visits to fully understand how to order properly.  If you want a bottle of beer or pop, you grab it out of the cooler (tub full of ice), stick it in a large pail, then fill the pail full of ice to keep it cold.  If you want some sides or dessert, there are some options in a refrigerator before you arrive at the counter.  You simply take what you want and pay at the front.  The second time to Rudy's was also a good experience.  I tried the jalapeno sausage, lean brisket, chicken, and beans.  The beans, sausage, and chicken was good, but the brisket had a distinct lighter fluid / gas taste to the meat.  If this is how their brisket usually tastes, then I will probably just stick with the sausages and chicken.  Also, it appears as though their BBQ sauce consists of crushed pepper corns.  I hate pepper corns.  The sauce is okay just as long as you steer clear of the pepper.  In sum, their air conditioning is awesome and the food is pretty damn good and reasonably priced.  I would definitely return to Rudy's.

While their BBQ is pretty good, the little breakfast burritos they make in the morning are not.  I ordered about six of these greasy things to share with my coworkers and felt sick the rest of the day.  I am pretty sure they gave me the scoots.  Avoid their breakfast, because the food will make you sick and regretful.

I am going to give this location 5-stars just to even out the idiotic people (Jeff G. and Mike K.) who reviewed the wait time of a restaurant that has just opened up.  Here is a fact of life: when popular restaurants open up at a new location, said location will have extremely long and abnormal wait times for at least 1-2 months.  This varies depending on the restaurant and the area.  I don't know why anyone would go to this Oregano's with the ridiculous expectation of being seated immediately and served their order within 15-20 minutes.  This place is brand new!  People are still learning, it is incredibly popular, there are tons of visitors here for Spring Training, and there should be an understanding of what to expect.
