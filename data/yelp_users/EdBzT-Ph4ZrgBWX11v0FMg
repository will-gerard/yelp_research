I love this place and the people who run it.  There is no other place in Phoenix  you will want to go IF you want to feel special.  Lamb is amazing and I have yet to be served anything I didn't love.  Don't forget to BYOW   Bring your own Wine.   Love it!

I have been going to Giuseppe's for years and years.  This is the real deal.  No place quite like it in Scottsdale or Phoenix.  Yes, I know there is another one.  I used to go there when Pasquale owned that one too.  It's ok, but it is not the real, honest to goodness one that Pasquale owns and runs.  You feel like you have just stepped off a plane to Italy...the Naples region actually.  The olive oil is not like any other you will get anywhere.  My personal fav is the eggplant rollatini.  I always start with the pasta fagioli, a Giuseppe salad.  I love this restaurant and the family that run it.  A must go place for any and all visitors.   PS  the desserts are made by his wife or mom.  YUM!

I'm going to have to agree with Blythe R.  This place is just not the same.  Servious, it was just ok at best. We ordered two "guacatonis" and they were both over cooked.  Some of the food was cold and the pasta mushy.  For sure I won't be going back to this particular Oregano's.  Oh, by the way, I have been here dozens of times. We even had a rehearsal dinner here.  It used to be a real favorite. It is just not the same.

I love my delivered Mountain Valley Spring water in glass bottles.  But the time you have to wait on the phone to talk to a customer service representative is ridiculous.  I have waited 24 minutes so far.  Btw.  I was calling to add service.... still waiting....26 minutes....still waiting. My drivers btw are wonderful.  Phone service is awful.

This is great, fresh and delish.  My only complaint would be that I would love more salads.  I am a wheat free, gluten free person and can't eat the "bread."   I love the kale salad and hope that in the future, they will expand their salad menu.  Love the crew that own and work here.

My new favorite Mexican food restaurant.  Love the salsa choices.  The chips are great.  My favorite is the vegetarian tacos.  Amazing!

Went again. This time I ordered the nutty buddy.  Seriously delish.  The sweet salty combo is wonderful. Just the right amount of hot fudge and peanuts.  The whipped cream was the best ever...they make it onsite.  This really is the best ice cream.
