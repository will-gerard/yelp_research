I shop for beer almost exclusively, so I'll review this place exclusively with regards to their beer.  I came in here looking for a Firestone Double Jack to take home to New Mexico since that brewery and their wonderful beers aren't distributed back home and I thought for sure Lee's, with the four Yelp stars and glowing reputation would have what I need.   I scoured a few rows of beers and discovered that there were only a few rows of beers, which seemed odd considering the massive store. Where the heck were all the beers? On quantity alone for beer, this place failed me.   Well, how about the quality of the selection? No bueno? Nope. Very few things I couldn't find at a Trader Joe's or Whole Foods, first of all, and very few of the rare beers a whale hunter like myself goes after. It doesn't matter where I go, I usually stumble upon some rarity or five and walk out of the store with buyer's remorse at the amount I just spent. Not here. There were very, very few beers of note here. I almost didn't find the Double Jack I came for and that beer is very ubiquitous in the states that border Cali.  But here's the real kicker and why I give the two stars rather than three. I'm that snob that, if I were to have an establishment selling beer, I'd keep my inventory clean, keep an eye on freshness dates and expirations, and make sure my customers were getting the beers the way the brewery intended. So that Double Jack, a hop-heavy beer that is best consumed fresh, really shouldn't have a bottled on date of January 2013 and still be on shelves. That's not fair to consumers or the breweries. Lee's either doesn't manage their inventory correctly or doesn't care about their consumers. Either way, bad business.

This place was pricey ($22 for a buffalo burger), but damn, was my burger slamming.   I think it was called the Herbert Keller burger (or some other old white guy name) and it was a massive, tender and juicy treat (pause). The meat was flavorful, the ciabatta bun was a perfect complement, and the the grilled onions tasted like they'd been scooped out of the best french onion soup. Add to this the spinach and bleu cheese that had melded together, and you have the recipe for bliss.  The salmon burger was also good, sizable and a healthy alternative to a regular beef burger. Unfortunately, the delicious fries and onion rings probably offset any health value to be found in this meal.  Still, this place impressed me, as burger places can often disappoint, and I'd probably give it five stars if it weren't for the high prices.  Oh, and I should remark that the beer selection here was enviable. Great selection of international bottles, plus Fat Tire on draft. Fat Tire, son.

First off, thanks to all the Yelpers whose reviews guided us to this place while in Vegas.   Upon entering, the classy, lounge-like ambiance will attract the eye; sitting at a booth will further the sentiment as you cozy in and enjoy the superb music selection.   As for the food, outstanding to say the least. The waiter, who was friendly, attentive and gregarious, recommended the spicy peppers as an appetizer (and as an alternative to edamame) and they were delicious. The buttery sauce meshed well with the semi-spicy chilies and made for a light, not-so-filling starter.  We followed with the BBQ eel (grilled maybe, I forget) and the lobster tempura, both of which had a distinct and delectable taste. In general, I enjoy sushi that has some sort of sauce drizzled over it, and both of these had a spicy one, which I appreciated.   Dessert followed, and we went for the lava cake with Kenyan coffee to accompany it. Good combination and a great finish to an outstanding meal.   I also had and would recommend the cachaca drink after dinner, it was somewhat like a White Russian but with the distinct taste that cachaca offers.   Overall, this was an outstanding meal and a great way to splurge in Vegas and not be disappointed. Meal for two with tip cost $180, which was well worth it for the combination of ambiance, service, food and drink.

Another great spot that Yelpers lead me to. The decor and the high tables and chairs weren't ideal, but the food was outstanding.   Following Yelpers' advice, we tried the clam chowder to start, and as reviewed, it was outstanding, reminiscent of the best I'd had in Boston.   We also received some good bread to start our meal, which was nice.   We then followed with an oyster dish, forget the name, but it was oysters with spinach and parmesan and a horseradish sauce on the side. AWESOME. We ordered six, but I would've liked about twenty more.   We then had the shrimp jambalaya, which although not entirely NO authentic, was still very good. The shrimp were especially good. It seemed they'd been grilled first and then thrown in the jambalaya, creating a really complex flavor.   I really liked this spot. I also liked that by strategically ordering the chowder and the oysters, we were able to save some money, as the place is on the expensive side if you get chowder, an appetizer and two entrees.

The food here is pretty average if not plain bad. Do not go here if you are hoping for some good Mexican food.   However, considering that you're in expensive Vegas, the $2 tacos and beer are a nice option to have. I came here twice for that very reason.   The tacos, which are Taco Bell style, hard shell with cheddar cheese and sour cream, were good for being far from authentic and only two bucks.   I also tried the tortilla soup, which is really a misnomer, since this soup was more like some sort of tomato soup with tortilla chips on the side.   Again, this place isn't necessarily bad, just not authentic and not that good either.

Went here as part of a Hoover Dam tour that was part of a Groupon, so I wasn't expecting (nor wanted) much, but this still managed to disappoint.   The view of the chocolate-making factory was less than impressive and their weren't any cool chocolate fountains or anything to induce drooling. Plus, it took all of 20 seconds to walk. At the end of the walk, you are offered one small piece of chocolate, either white, milk or dark (red pill or blue pill, anyone?), which was good but really seemed to serve the purpose of enticing you to want to buy something in the gift shop you immediately walk into.  In the shop, you'll find plenty of overpriced chocolates, all of which I couldn't help but thinking were so much less tasty than the chocolates I've been buying from Trader Joe's.   The desert garden (or whatever it is) out front, was pretty nice. Way better than the factory or the tour.

Got a close to $4 coffee here---yeah, just regular coffee and was expecting something tasty. Not in the least bit. The coffee was weak (like Starbucks) and didn't taste like better than something I could get at 7-11. I brew better coffee at home for a fraction of a price.  Definitely a disappointment. Glad I don't live in Vegas, because if I had to buy this coffee when in need, I'd just throw myself in front of a Deuce bus.

A nice coffee house in downtown Vegas. I had some good espresso shots, which made up for my initial disappointment at not being able to order a beer (which are only available after 7).  The ambiance is nice and relaxing and it was nice to find something besides Starbucks in Vegas.   I'd go back again next time I'm in Vegas.

Though it sucks to have a layover on a relatively short flight from LA to Albuquerque, this restaurant made the layover in Phoenix more than tolerable.   Thanks to Yelpers, I chose this place over several other seemingly attractive options and found a very unlikely food option in an airport. The place was a bakery, pizza spot and sandwich spot all rolled into one. At times, this can be bothersome, as specialization is key, but again, it's in an airport.   My wife and I were in sandwich mode and looking for something hot and we both found good options. I chose the Cubano hot pressed panini and my wife the hot pressed tuna sandwich. The prices were more reasonable than I'm used to from airports at about $7.50, so this provided some comfort.   When the food came, my cubano looked delicious and the taste did not disappoint. I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though I'd say a ham and cheese sandwich with pickles would be a more accurate description. My wife too liked her sandwich.   We had some cookies too and found them good, albeit sweet as all hell.   I'd seek this place out again if stuck in Phoenix in the future.
