Staff is very friendly, but the photographer for this property really deserves an award.  They masterfully captured the only perfect parts of this property and managed to make it look like a real Embassy Suites hotel.  There is nothing very nice about this properly.  It's location makes you want to put on body armor and run like hell from your car to the locked gates after dark.  You don't sleep well even the beds are comfortable because you wonder if your car is getting broke into.  The parking passes set the expectation that there is a high likelihood it's going to happen with their disclaimer.  The hotel is very dated and they made attempts to freshen it up but it's basically lipstick on a pig. Just because the pig is wearing lipstick doesn't stop it from being a pig.  Because of this experience I will never book a hotel at Embassy Suites unless I have personally seen the properly before.  Usually when you hear Embassy Suites you think of quality chain with very nice properties.  If they are smart they will remove this hotel from their brand so it can be rebranded as a Motel 6 to properly set the expectation.

Best service I have ever gotten at this Olive Garden. Definitely coming back if service stays at this level.

I found this place with Yelp and thought I would give it a try.   I was very impressed with the service. With the number of positive reviews I was afraid it may be packed so I made a reservation with open table.  We arrived and were immediately seated. It was busy, but for lunch doesn't look like a reservation is necessary.  Our server was amazing and I regret not getting her name. She was very attentive and I appreciated her questions. She asked if we were looking to rush in and out. It was a working lunch so we let her know we weren't in a big rush. She said she likes to ask in case we needed to be back within an hour.  We ordered our food I went with the St. Louis ribs and the Mac and Cheese as my side.  We had our food within 10 minutes.  The ribs were very tender and had a great taste. We were offered extra BBQ sauce which I enjoyed the flavor.  I was really surprised by the Mac and cheese. It was very good and my favorite part of my meal.  We stayed at our table for an hour and forty-five minutes.  We didn't want to be rude by taking up space, but they told us there was no rush and to enjoy our beverages and finish up our work.  Glad I found this place.

I was very surprised by our visit to Outback tonight.  Out management team is in town for a meeting and we decided to grab a quick dinner.  Our waitress Trista was very attentive to our needs.  Our drinks never went empty.  Our food was cooked perfectly.  My only complaint is our table was very close to a table on both sides of us so it became a little to cozy.

My review is mostly based on the service we got from Drew.   We called ahead to let them know we had a large party and would have 13 guests.  Well we were in town for the Automatic Body homecoming so word got out that Claim Jumpers was the place for dinner.  Our dinner party ending up growing to not only need the large table setup for our group but other booths in the surrounding area.  Drew was very attentive and was able to get drinks and food out in a timely manner.   You wouldn't have known we were in a large party.  Almost everyone was pleased with their food.  We had one steak that wasn't cooked correctly. As soon as Drew came around and saw the steak he says that isn't right and immediately had the cook prepare another one.   They had a replacement steak out in about 12 minutes. Was told it was amazing.  Overall Claim Jumpers pulled off a great dinner for such a large group.  Drew did a great job giving out separate tabs and getting them all accurate.

Well my dining experience started off on the wrong foot.  I was seated within a few minutes and then I sat there for a long time contemplating if I should just leave since no one was waiting on me. Yes I'm very impatient if you read my reviews but at the 12 minute mark if I don't know who my server is I'm ready to leave.  My waitress came over and grabbed my order finally.  My sweet potato fries came out and then a manager came over to apologize which really caught me off guard. I didn't complain I was just reading the news on my phone.  She explained the hostess made a mistake and there was a miscommunication on who was to wait on me.  She then told me my fries were on the house so that made them even sweeter.  Burger was outstanding when they say they are putting Franks red hot on the burger they don't lie.   After my meal I asked if I could get a Strawberry shake to go and then they comped that because they felt so bad about me having to wait.  Again I didn't complain not one single word so I was extremely impressed they recognized their error and wanted to fix it.  This was my second time dining at a Zine Burger and I hope to make it back to Arizona to dine here again.  The food is very high quality and they definitely care about the customer experience.
