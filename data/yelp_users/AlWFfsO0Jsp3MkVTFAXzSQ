Consultation was good - follow up after work was complete was non-existent.   Issues: 1. They made the decision to lay spring sod in the winter. Overwatered the grass and never bothered to come back. The backyard is extremely lumpy now and I had to pay $300 to get winter grass replanted.   2. Pavers in the back cracked and they decided just to fill the cracks with epoxy rather than replacing.   3. No returned calls or emails after we had paid 8k for all work done. I decided to take their sign down which was never picked up after almost a year because the front yard was embarrassing. I feel like I did them a favor.   All in all craftsmanship was just ok. Find another company, I won't be using to do the backyard.   Good luck to you Alexon.

My wife and I are regulars at Chop. The staff has always treated us well and restaurant is organized. If there is ever a mistake, they are quick to fix. I think the Management has done an outstanding job of turning this place into a local hangout. I take my coworkers in that come from out of town every time.   My recommendations: Stone IPA and Prime Rib with creamy horseradish.   Keep up the great work, we love this place!

Rony has been my barber for the last 5 years. I've come to the conclusion that he's the best I've ever seen at his craft. This is coming from someone who has difficult hair and is extremely particular. I trust Rony.   Rony's greatest strengths lie in his ability to build trust quickly, rapport, consultation, and customer service. He makes you feel like you're his only customer when you're in his chair.   I would highly suggest Rony if you're looking for a great overall experience.

45 min to get drinks 1.5 hours to get cold food  Condescending wait staff and MGMT   Finally, I had to get our table silverware and plates from the bus station since that didn't seem to be important either.   No apology for lack of service and respect of patronage. Manager was a complete POS with an attitude that doesn't belong in the service industry.   We won't be back any time soon. Very poor experience.
