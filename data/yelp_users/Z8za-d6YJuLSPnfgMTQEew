I tried this place for take out today. I am a short walk away. I found on yelp some pretty good reviews and decided to try it. I had the mussels and a simple salad and was pleasantly surprised! The interior is very nice and welcoming. I could imagine wanting to come here for a romantic dinner. Friendly people too.

I really love this place. The fact that you can come in and get a sandwich and breakfast items as well as a smoothie or juice...love! That's totally the start I need before a long day of work. Nice location, nice people inside, what more do you need??

Our AC went out at our house in the beginning of June leading us to stay here for a night until we could get someone to fix it. We were frustrated coming in and we were welcomed with very nice, accommodating staff. The room was really nice and clean. We're very happy with what we got for a very reasonable rate!

Drive thru chick named Kylie wouldn't take my order because I wanted two separate orders at 1 am. Both very small and simple, with one car in the drive thru other than myself. What a joke.

The pizza is amazing. Homemade sauce and real ingredients you can not beat. My waitress Katie was fantastic, attentive and personable. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for Chicago style pizza or just pizza in general.

Food is good. Says they're open until midnight on Saturdays but I just tried walking in at 9:30 and they told me the kitchen was closed. Bogus

I used to work here, so my expectations may be higher than some....  ....but I mean I live 5 minutes away and my damn burger was cold when I got home....  Y'ALL SUCK.

The only reason I gave this a 4/5 is because most of the time that I come in the servers are usually rude. Last night when I went in with a friend to have dinner I had a really nice man for a waiter, I forgot his name, and he redeemed the place for me.   The food is always amazing. Cilantro jalape√±o hummus? AWESOME! Always a good meal and I usually have some to take home with me. I would recommend this place to pretty much anyone.   And anyplace that I can order a Woodchuck is already a good place for me ;-)

The two morning ladies at this specific subway are awesome! I've never had a skimpy sandwich and they are really friendly. I usually come before 10 am for work and I am always happy!

The food is really good, and was served to me in a mostly timely manner for how busy they were. The selection of sodas is amazing! The only reason I wouldn't give this place all 5 stars is because the lobby was pretty dirty coming in. All of the tables were well used and that doesn't appeal to me. Otherwise, good place!

I love this place. Always friendly service and always delicious food! It has a unique friendly atmosphere that I love. I brought about 10 wraps to a work meeting once and everyone loved them. They're really health conscious and I like that you can get a wrap or a salad on any item. I would recommend this place to anyone.

One of my favorite places. Never had a sandwich I didn't like and I've tried them all by now! Friendly staff, whom knows me by name now and always addresses me as so. Warm and welcoming, not to mention all day breakfast! Kale salad is a delicious and healthy choice for a side. Pomegranate green tea is perfect with any of the sandwiches. This is seriously my favorite place to go to. They are very easy going and let you add or drop anything off of the sandwiches to fit your preferences. If you have a minute when you stop in, read the "How Zookz came to be" on the wall, it will touch your heart! All around amazing place.

Stopped by for the first time this morning, found this place by asking the yelp gods for some new breakfast spots. Conveniently this is right down the street from me. I had an egg, cheese and bacon sandwich on a garlic bagel that was toasted, it was delicious. I was worried that it would be skimpy but I was proved wrong. I will definitely be back to try some more of their bagels, there are many flavors to try! Plus you can't go wrong with China Mist tea!

To the eye walking by this place may not seem appealing. However, I am a huge fan of the hole in the wall places that are actually gems...and this is one of them. My boyfriend and I come here quite often since I found it via Yelp and it's always good and the service is fast and friendly. Support local!

I was recommended to see Sam to get a hair cut this weekend. I was able to get the appointment time and day I wanted right away. I arrived early and while I waited and shopped around I was asked multiple times if I needed any help or wanted a soda or water.  Sam herself was excellent. She listened to exactly what I wanted and continuously asked questions about how I usually wore my hair to help give me the cut that I wanted and needed. I am very happy and will definitely be returning to her for future appointments!

I've been here multiple times, usually to pick up sandwiches on the weekends and I've always had a good experience. I appreciate that the combo price includes any size drink and they are easy and accommodating if you substitute anything on the sandwiches. Good food and a good place all around.

I will begin by saying I am a tad picky with salons. My mother owned her own in Chicago when I was growing up and I was always in a salon. I LOVE THIS PLACE! It is so clean with a lot of seats. I have never gotten a normal pedicure that included hot stones, and it is amazing.  I recently tried an eyebrow and lip wax, and it was flawless.   Everyone that has done my nails here has done a wonderful job. They take their time and make sure that they do good work. It is a warm and inviting and always FRIENDLY! I cannot tell you how many times I went into a salon filled with rude cosmetologists. I am definitely on my way to being a regular here and recommend it to anyone.

Holy bananas! I just tried this place as a recommendation from people I work with...amazing! Service was relatively fast as I walked in and ordered to go. Everything smelled amazing and my food tasted so good!

My boyfriend and I just had lunch there and got two noodle dishes. The service was friendly and the food was delicious and out in a timely manner. The restaurant itself was very clean and inviting. I would definitely recommend!

We've been here a couple of times since the opening. We've had good service every time with friendly people. Plus our bowls were massive, more than any other chipotle has given us. This one is a winner.

I'm pretty surprised at the lack of stars for this location. I was stoked when I saw it wasn't paradise anymore and have been coming at least once a week ever since. I come for breakfast before work and ALWAYS I have experienced fast service and friendly people. Panera is always delicious. This is a good place and I will definitely continue to come here often.
