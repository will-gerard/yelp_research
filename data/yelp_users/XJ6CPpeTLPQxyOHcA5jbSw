Reasonable prices for great service (I'm usually out the door for $26 total).  These guys won't let you sit around too long.  If you want to talk, they'll talk - sports, women, whatever.  If you don't want to converse, then you can watch one of the TVs they have at each chair.  Each regular cut ends with a straight edge shave and hot or cold towel, as well as a quick machine massage.  Good guys here, well worth a few extra bucks over going to Cost Cutters etc.

I had my first ever collision when I got clipped in the rear right wheel.  The suspension was messed up, and I had to get it towed to a collision center.  This place came up as recommended both by Volkswagen and my insurance carrier, State Farm.  That made the tow free and price negotiations for the repairs headache free.  Repairs were done rather quickly (within a few days).  There was a bit of an issue with the suspension, still - so I brought it back in, they made some adjustments, and it was good to go just like that.  They were very professional and easy to work with.  Side note: I can't spend a ton of time on the phone during the day as I have a desk job that requires me to multitask and keep shifting my attention from one thing to another. They are great with using email to communicate status, estimates, etc. If I'm ever unfortunate enough to get into another collision, I'll be calling these guys right away.

Awesome selection of bottled beers.  Live music sometimes.  Good stuff.  Fair warning:  Don't come here on First Fridays.  It's packed and ridiculous.

Best chicken fingers I've had.  Other options in the Valley can get close (i.e. Raising Cane's) but this place is unparalleled.  This is a really small place, about as local as it gets - so feel good about spending your money here!  Talk up the owner and bring your friends - he'll hook you up with extra sauce or an extra finger.

There is no better way to watch a movie than the Cinema Suites here.  No kids and recliner chairs are the way to go.  Drinks are fine, food menu is better than I would have expected.  It's a bit pricier, but worth it.  Side note - if you want to save some bucks, come for a morning matinee show.  Spend what you'd save otherwise on a Bloody Mary at the bar before you go in.  Worth it!

Super convenient, right off the 143 on the south side of University. Price is decent, and you get $2 off per day with a AAA card. You can reserve a spot online if you're traveling during a busy weekend and want to ensure you won't be left scrambling, though I've never had to.  Just don't lose your ticket!

I haven't been to a haunted house since I was in high school (over 12 years ago), but a friend mentioned a group outing and I was all in!  I had to leave my girlfriend behind, as she doesn't like scares - but being a person who appreciates a good horror movie, I was looking forward to jumping a few times.  I'll admit, the folks who work at The Nest - they got me a few times!  First of all, I like the location at Rawhide.  If you haven't ever been, it's an old west town, used for corporate events and the like - but it's a great venue for this type of thing.  There's a restaurant / saloon at the front, so you can have a drink if you're a bit nervous before the scares (we did exactly that), and there are a few shops and various photo opps throughout, before you get to The Nest.  When you get your ticket, you also get a lanyard with an RFID tag and a card that directs you to register and link up your Facebook account.  Don't miss out on this part!  You'll see some interactive things during the haunted house itself with your name on it, and you'll get some pics posted to your FB profile (infrared shots of you screaming, if you're lucky).  I won't go into much detail on the house itself, as that would be rather spoilery (and nobody should like spoilers).  It's divided into sections, i.e. the dark house, the mirror house, the 3D house (yes, really) among others.  My greatest advice for haunted houses based on my limited experience - make sure you're going with folks who will have fun with it - it is what you make it.  If your friends are there to roll their eyes at everything, then you're not going to have fun.  Just go with the flow and let yourself get scared by that guy around the corner with his eye falling out!

My garage door has had problems closing and I've pretty much lived with it that way for a couple years. Made a quick call, they were out here later that day, and after a reasonable fee I no longer have to push on my garage door to get it to shut. Very pleased!

One of the better Filiberto's in terms of quality. Can't beat them for Mexican fast food. This location has a salsa bar, to boot.  Recommendation: BRC - the Beans / Rice / Cheese burrito - it's not on the menu but it's a solid option. Get it with a side of guac and sour cream.  Downsides to this location: no drive thru, and limited hours during the week.  24 hours Friday / Saturday.

Been to a couple of shows here so I feel like I can give an accurate assessment...  The seating layout is a bit odd, as they put you at big long tables sitting across from your friends.  It works okay, and I guess there's really no such thing as a perfect dinner / drinks set up, unless you're in a large theater in Vegas.  My most recent trip was to see Amy Schumer. The owner came out at the beginning and was up front with us when he got word that she was sick and would not be able to make it. He immediately offered us all refunds for our tickets, tickets to see Jeff Ross the following weekend, and tickets if Amy Schumer would reschedule. In my opinion, that's above and beyond what would be expected in such an unfortunate situation - and it surely didn't go unappreciated! We were able to to get our refund and future tickets on the spot before leaving, so we left without having to wonder about the details.  Side note: Kevin Farley and David Spade were originally going to be in the audience for Amy Schumer, but stepped up to the plate to perform a bit for us in addition to all of the above. Way cool!

Good food, good drink selection - can't complain about that.  Then you walk into the venue, and it's all sorts of fantastic.  Bleacher seating if you wanna chill. Places to put your food and drink if you want to mill about.  The place is pretty small so if your favorite band comes through here it's a MUST that you check them out - very intimate.  Another bar towards the back is pretty accessible and the bathrooms are never a hassle.

The facilities, sound, and seating all seemed okay.  We had floor seating, which was specially arranged for the event we were attending - definitely pushed way too close together for comfort, though.  There was a cash bar, but no ATM - the single ATM they had on site was broken.  Why not two, guys?  You need a backup plan!  The worst part was the parking.  I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt - hey it's a new facility, they are figuring that part out...  But coming here I am proven otherwise with reviews dating back to a year ago complaining about poor traffic management coming out of their garage.  We were on the third floor of the garage and it took us nearly an hour to get out onto Camelback.  They need to hire more police for big events to keep the flow steady.

Went for lunch on a Friday in a small group during the workday.  Got calamari for an appetizer round.  Breading was great, good flavor, and dip wasn't half bad especially when combined with their special hot sauce (I guess they also sell it at $5 a bottle - spicy / sweet).  Each of us got a small burger (they're all available in large / small which is great), but unfortunately each of our medium ordered burgers came back well done.  I imagine such a smaller burger would be tough to cook appropriately, but I would hope that a place that specializes in burgers could figure out proper times on these things.  I had the same issue at another burger joint (not to be named in this review).  That sort of thing just blows my mind.  In the end, we'd prefer burgers cooked to order, but we're not terribly picky.  Everything else about the burgers was top notch.  Our server was very friendly, outgoing and helpful - when she overheard a comment about the burgers (seriously, we weren't ones to complain) she offered to comp the meals which we didn't want - ended up hooking us up with milkshakes (also quite good).  Oh, I can't believe I'm leaving this for the last item on my review - but the sweet potato tots.  Oh, the sweet potato tots!  I'll come back here often for those alone.  The texture and the taste, and the dipping sauces...  Amazing!

We decided to pop in here after happy hour on a Friday night.  I saw photos on Facebook about the arcade games and such, and thought it'd be a fun way to keep the night going!  I was correct, to be sure.  The set up of the place is intriguing - it's connected to Lucky Strike bowling, but separated for some reason by a velvet rope.  I really have no idea why as we could walk back and forth - they just had some guy standing there moving the rope for us.  Gypsy bar is made up of three sections - the bar area, the dance floor, and the arcade.  The dance floor looked like any dance floor - good times if we decided to get hammered (we didn't, but maybe another time).  The bar was fine, nothing particular about it - good or bad.  The reason I'm excited about this place, though...  The arcade games!  It seems to me that the owners spent a drunken night at Dave and Busters and cherry picked the best social games from there.  Drinking and playing with your friends is a great experience.  Pac Man Battle Royal, the light touch game (you'd know it if you saw it), trivia, skee ball, pop a shot, crane games... They've got it all.  The set up is similar to D&B's, where you purchase a card with points to play the games.  Tickets get stored on the card automatically, and you can redeem for prizes at the counter (everything from candy to cool little toys and such).  I've got a couple hundred tickets on my card already, so I'll be back for more!  I've got my eyes on that Lord of the Rings PEZ collector's set...  Quick tip - Get your parking validated at the bowling shoes counter next door!

Food was decent. I got a patty melt and my friend got pulled pork sliders. No complaints there!  Beer prices are absurd though. Got two Ballast Point IPAs and they came out to $9 each. Not sure how they justify that but I am not sure I'll be back anytime soon...
