The food is fresh - the lunch bowls are so customizable that nobody can really have an excuse to leave hungry or unhappy.    The service is prompt and unfussy, this place knows its business and its customers and does a great job of lunch.   The parking lot is gruesome, but that can't be helped on this corner. If I didn't have a 35 mile commute, this would be a happy hour goto for sure.

I've been for an anniversary and for a rare "all the sisters are together" dinner - and both times the cost was utterly ridiculous, and I didn't regret a single penny.   My recommendation is to recognize that the menu shifts in order to offer seasonal selections; and call ahead to find out what's on the chef's tasting menu.   Get that, and if you don't like the sound of what's on it, wait a couple months and call back.   Everything we've ever had here has been perfectly prepared, professionally presented in appropriate time frames, and utterly delicious.    The tasting menu consistently offers a variety of tastes so that it's difficult to be at all disappointed.   It's not someplace I would *ever* consider not planning for; it's a lot of money and it's not just dinner; it's a commitment to an evening where you just concentrate on the food and the company you keep.

Blue Saguaro has been doing the same menu of breakfast sandwiches (seriously delicious - toasted sourdough drenched in salty butter, egg over medium, crispy bacon and melty American but not Kraft cheese) and lunch sandwiches & salads for over 10 years.    There's a reason that it hasn't really changed:  It works.   The lunch menu has specialty vs regular sandwiches.   Most of the specialty are loaded up with sandwich fixings you're not going to get in a chain shop - cream cheese, sprouts, avocado that wasn't spread on thinner than mustard.   The bread is bakery quality and there's a decent selection.   The ambience is non existent, but when you're grabbing lunch on the run it really doesn't matter.       They are super fast, but that may be because I always tip a buck.   :)

Drs. Tracy and Huber are friendly, efficient, and down to earth.   I've been a patient for over 10 years and when it came time to start taking my kids to the dentist, I decided against the kiddie dentist and brought both of them in to see Dr. Tracy.   Margie got my then 3 year old son to sit calmly through an entire cleaning, and I credit her patience and skill!   Dr. Tracy & Margie also took care of my 2 year old daughter and she sat through descaling with them and even an exam of an odd bump on her hard palate.   These folks are in business because they are doing what they love for people they respect, and they do a wonderful job of it.   I am a huge fan of Mill Ave Dentistry, and that's something coming from someone with a terrible dislike of having dental work done.   No tricks, no gimmicks, no nonsense, just friendly smart people doing a darn good job.

I've been going through scheduling nightmares with work and have had to reschedule my daughter's cleaning... three times.   Susie has been understanding and helpful in getting us set up at a time that I can make it.  The flexibility and compassion with this has been stellar; businesses could learn a thing or two about being helpful and fostering existing relationships from this dentist.  And never in a million years would I have thought I'd write that about a dentists' office.

Brian has worked on our 92 Navajo, our 03 Nissan Z, my current 07 Mustang, my 01 Focus, and my 94 Escort - and ALWAYS gave us a thorough explanation and fair pricing.   I cannot recommend Brian highly enough.   He is a superstar in coveralls.   Another reviewer mentioned the state of the shop - he's right.  It's filthy and uninviting - but WHO CARES.   Your car is in great hands and you can surely find something better to do than to hang out while it gets fixed.

This is toddler heaven.   For about $20, I can feed a family of four with chicken that can be identified as actual chicken and not particle-chicken.  The staff at this location is young, courteous, and friendly.   It's highly family oriented at this location, you can pretty much bank on traffic in the play area every evening.    The facilities are kept reasonably clean; there's going to be a bit of a greasy feel sometimes no matter how much you do when there's 18 deep fryers going all day.  It seems like the fries are always a wee bit underdone, so we just get fruit which is better for us anyhow.  The chicken is always blistering hot, with the meat juicy and delicious.  Trading in the Veggie Tales cds in the kids' meal for a tiny ice cream cone is a no brainer every time.    The only drawback to this Chick Fil A are the parents who don't monitor their children's activity in the play area.   I tend to end up being mother hen, demanding 11 year olds stop climbing on the outside of the equipment so that they don't fall and squash a 2 year old below.     Overall, this place has saved me from making dinner once every couple weeks quite admirably.

For $5 per toddler on a Saturday morning, I really can't complain.   This place is a facility and shouldn't be judged on service (at least the way we saw it during open bounce - maybe parties are different?).     There was an attendant in the room with us the whole time, but it's very much on the parent to ensure the safety of your child.   Unfortunately there are some parents who don't see a need to enforce the rules; and to expect a 17 year old attendant to police a 14 year old running the wrong way up a bounce house slide is a little ridiculous.   Bottom line - it's good cheap fun for small kids as long as you have an eagle eye and don't mind doing a little good natured parenting to other kids who aren't being supervised all that vigilantly.   If you don't have the personality to tell other people's kids to tone it down, you probably want to avoid going here; because there were a couple of older kids who had zero supervision from their parents (in the corner reading a book) who saw no problems with aggressive horseplay around the 2 - 5 year old set with no regard for their safety.  The inflatables were clean, there was some wear on them from lots of use; but nothing was unsafe or stinky - again that might have been because we were the first of the day to be in there.

If, like me, you don't generally go out of your way to pick up veggies in the store despite the fact that you really should, BB is the antidote to your ills.   The produce is good, you opt in on an as desired basis, and my pick up spot is literally around the block.   So much food we *always* share it with friends.   Organic is superb, but a little more spendy.   Looking forward to the Mexican food package that's this week's bonus basket.

Javino's is super speedy and delicious for lunch.   The portions are massive, quite frankly, and the majority of the lunch menu is just under $10.   The mediterranean wrap has marinated olives & a mild red pepper hommous that make it stand out as more than just some thrown together semi-middle-eastern fare that you can find across the strip mall at Extreme Pita.   The waitstaff is friendly and efficient, and the lunch crowd is laid back and eclectic.    The salads are absolutely fresh, the vinaigrette is delicious.   The wood fired pizza that I tried left a little to be desired - spinach and artichoke was a bit bland - but the crust was crispy and thin, and I still just can't get over the fact that I got a big old salad and a personal pizza for $9.95 in North Scottsdale.    Get in there before they raise the prices.

Given the propensity of chain restaurants in the area, it's refreshing to have something a little different and a lot delicious for a quick lunch in the Airpark area.   The lunch buffet at $8.99 is reasonable, and the offerings actually change on a daily basis.   The service is a little lackluster, but it's a lunch buffet so I'm not looking for someone to attend to my every whim when I can pretty much handle myself.    I've never seen this restaurant hurting for lunch customers; mainly Indian.  Try the Saag; even if you're not a spinach fan it's creamy, spiced just enough, and is a great invitation for you to use it to finish up every last bite of the fresh naan.

You would think that paying $18 for 6 cupcakes would guarantee you at least as good as Duncan Hines.   Sadly, this is not so.   The buttercream frosting was greasy and heavy, and the chocolate cake was dry.   We ordered these for my son's first birthday and I'm frankly pleased that he was too young to be disappointed.     The shop is cute, the staff is obnoxious, and I'll be surprised if this place lasts.   Niche businesses survive when they are consistently good at what they do.   Scottsdale Bakery & Cupcake Company - I hope you improve.   Love the concept, hate the service and the product.

I've wandered into the Trailhead a handful of times,  mostly to check out the food offerings and vaguely consider researching a bike in a locally owned shop.    First:  the food.    I got a salad with a sandwich, and while the sandwich was nothing to write home about, and the salad itself was redolent of red onion that had been taken off, the dressing was freaking delicious.   I think they load it up with paprika and some sort of honey mustard.   Not really anything I'd have ever tried otherwise, and that was fantastic.     The food is meh.   The pastries are substandard.  The service is slow, the guys that have been behind the counter are completely anti social unless you're a hipster or a bike nerd. I'm not ragging on either of you groups; but I fit squarely outside of both these categories.  Second:  the chai.   OMGWTFPOWDERED CHAI.    This is the most disgusting thing I never knew I didn't want to exist.   And for $4, are you kidding me??  Third:   Don't ask about bicycles if you are a novice and the tall dude with the high prescription glasses and the almost dreads is there.   He will look at you with his superior bike knowledge, dismiss your Mom outfit and your moderately priced purse not made of canvas or ripstop with no reflective properties to it whatsoever and treat you like a disdained child who crapped on his floor.     I wanted to research bikes for my kids and this guy is just wildly unapproachable, weird, and haughty, which goes for pretty much most of the staff in there unless you walk in WITH A BIKE HELMET AND SKINNY PANTS.  Also, bike tires stink when you're hungry.

I was really hoping for good food.   I knew when I walked in and saw a mile long deli case, plastic chairs and tables up against the wall and dim lighting that there was no ambiance or service to be had.   The shawarma was dry (how do you do that?), the rice tasteless, the kabobs greasy & bland and the hummus almost inedible.   The service was non existent.   Go to Pita Jungle or go to Tempe or Gilbert and go to Phoenicia.   Kabob Inn is not going to last with the food & service that they're providing.   This hurts my heart as I wish independently owned businesses would thrive in the area, and I miss good mediterranean food being a Dearborn native.  Very sad.

Tasty carne asada, tasty fish tacos.    Is there any more to say?   With all the options for cheap Mexican fare, it's not hard to be middling; Los Taquitos has a good thing going with simply seasoned well done fresh street tacos.  Serving sizes are adequate to a little too much, and prices are very reasonable.    Definitely a new lunch go-to.

Seriously?   $23.99 for linguine and clams?    I really wanted to have a closer go-to for well done simple Italian since Baci moved to QC, but this was just awful.   The menu is not extensive; so you'd expect that what is on there to be reasonably priced, and very well done.    My husband and I were turned off by the bizarre scented candle / restroom smell in the dining room, so we ate on the patio... with the bugs.   The restaurant is very recent, so you'd think they'd have the lights outside all in working order.   They're not.      The service was outstanding; Marcie was clearly a pro - but no level of service can make up for gamey canned clam bits on boxed linguine.   We'll drive to Baci next time.
