Absolutely horrible customer service. Spoke with a lady by the name of Deborah, about an issue i had with a thermostat that was replaced by them. She was VERY rude, and immediately started telling me that it was not their fault why my heater stopped working. She didn't even let me describe what was happening, before she started yelling and cursing over the phone. This lady has anger issues. I have never dealt with someone so unprofessional, let alone somebody who cursed at the clients. I will be notifying my home warranty company about this, and will NEVER be using this company again. I will also be getting in touch with the owner of this company. When i asked her to let me speak with him, she refused to give me his contact information. She then cursed at me and hung up. STAY AWAY!!! They do not stand behind their work!!!  ****UPDATE*****  Spoke with the owner "Bob", and he is just as rude as the lady who answers the phones. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.   I paid another company to come look at it, and they determined "4 A/C" hooked up my thermostat incorrectly. They forgot to instal a jumper, and also had the thermostat set to "gas" instead of "electric". What kind of company is this? You would think they would know how to instal a thermostat? If they cant get that right, how can you trust them to instal a full on A/C unit? I will NEVER be using this company again, and i urge you to please STAY FAR AWAY from 4 A/C. Avoid the headache, and call somebody else.

Great sushi at a great price! I will be a regular as long as they keep the lunch special. I usually place an order for pick up at least twice a week. Try the Philly roll! They put a generous amount of fish on their rolls. I wonder why its so dead every time i go in???
