This place is very large and nice inside and they have a very large humidor.  But, I didn't notice a lot of variety.  It was mostly a handful of brands with several boxes of a specific item.  They have tons of pipes + pipe tobacco, several humidors to pick from, lighters, knives, etc.  There is smoking in the store (except the humidor) which can be a bit of a turn off to those that only like to intake smoke when they are smoking (I'm like this).  The only place to linger if you aren't smoking is the humidor anyway right?    It was so large I completely forget I showed up near close.  They were never pushy and came to ask if we needed anything a few times.  I didn't realize until we left.  I am never that guy, and felt bad for it.  We grabbed a few cigars and hit the road.  The prices are quite high.  I bought some Sancho Panza's at 40% off and they were still more expensive than a larger cigar (same line) in the humidor at Total Wine.  With it being further from my house than 5-10 other cigar shops and that I typically avoid the 'Tuke because of the resident's being in denial about actually living in Phoenix...  I will stick closer to home.  The other reason is I avoid places with employees that pack heat.  Too much overcompensation screws up my chi.     (in the hidden reviews you will find an attempt by the owner to post a 5 star, which is in poor taste IMO.)

This was the 2nd time I've golfed at Dobson Ranch.  The first time we decided not to go back.  They cram too many people on the course, which just makes the day drag along.  This time the course wasn't busy but when we get there we find out that they are over-seeding so tee-boxes can't be used, and that the carts could not leave the path.  And to top it off, no cart girl on a day it was 98 degrees.  Wow, that would have been important information when the reservation was made a week or two prior.  I went in a group of 9 (a group of 2, 4, and 3) for some birthday golf, which is the only reason I came back to this place.  We had 2 seniors behind the group that called to complain so from early on we had rangers busting our balls.    Rather than try to get us to enjoy their miserable course and conditions, they decided to make it even more obvious that a group spending $200 ($28per person for a round) on golf and another $100 at the bar/restaurant on a Tuesday was not worth their time.  They should have been throwing vouchers and coupons at us to come back and apologizing for the conditions and the lack of notice but they didn't do that.  This place lacks even mediocre customer service.  They cater to the guys golfing with a senior discount.  If you are looking to have any fun (ie talking, socializing, smiling) and not take your golf so serious, go elsewhere.  Memo to Dobson Ranch.  If you want us to take our golf as serious as a professional, start treating customers professionally, and have a respectable course.  I would prefer any of the several muni's in the area that give you twice the value, and twice the service.  Icing on the cake is that hole 1 and 10 are right next to the range.  There is no net to keep the multitude of range balls from littering the course.  Do they care?  No.  Literally every place we took a shot from, the sprinkler went on.  This happened to both groups.  We think they were doing it on purpose (conspiracy? maybe), it was crazy how they would go on and off as we would get closer and farther away from them.  We had to run back to the cart several times to save phones/cameras.  The cherry on top was when I went in to get a cup of ice from the bartender after our round and she tried charging me 50 cents even though the guy she just replaced was giving them to us at no cost all day.

Took 5 minutes to get a menu.  Another 5 to get our drinks.  We ordered what we always order at our favorite Korean place which is the Bulgogi, and mushroom tofu soup.  I figured these are very popular dishes, and easy measuring sticks to compare different places.  They give complimentary salad which includes iceberg lettuce... and teriyaki sauce.  No thanks.    Bulgogi:  Really wasn't good at all.  It was too thick, the onions were 100% raw and there was no flavor beyond intense onion and poorly bbq'd beef.  It should be THIN, and TENDER, and FLAVORFUL.  Failed in all aspects  Tofu Soup:  Server asked how spicy we wanted it, and we said normal.  Apparently that means zero spicy or just adding 3 jalapeno slices into the soup.  That's authentic right?  They also use a very runny type of tofu, not the more firm stuff I have and like at my other spot.  It really had the texture of egg whites.  In fact, it had the exact texture of the egg white that was also in the soup.  So it was just watery flavorless broth, with textureless tofu and textureless egg b/c it wasn't hot enough to properly cook the egg.  Factor in the tough mushrooms that were obviously re-hydrated and you have a very poor dish.    They stiffed us bowls or plates, unless they expected us to reuse the salad bowls so we had to wait around for a while to ask for something to eat on.  They also brought the dishes out at different times which is bad form.    The best and worst parts were actually the sides.  What the hell are those shrimp, and why are they on my table?  They were dis-gus-ting.  Kimchi didn't taste fresh, bean things weren't that good, bean sprouts were too mature to be good and the cucumber thing probably sat around too long and got soggy like cucumbers like to do.  The daikon kimchi was the only solid side.      My go to place is Cho Dang in Chandler for my Korean BBQ.  It blows this place away on all levels.  Their meat is of much higher quality, they actually include stone rice with their soup, serve amazing sides, and the atmosphere is a lot less cafeteria like.   To top it off it is about $5 less for the same exact order, but with larger portions of sides, rice, and meals.  Really isn't a whole lot of good to say about this place.  I'd give it 1.5 stars, not quite bad enough to get a 1, but certainly not good enough to simply earn a "meh" rating.  I actually started this review by giving them 2 stars but as I started writing I realized there really wasn't anything positive I took away from the experience.  Couldn't even get an iced tea refill for the last 10+ minutes we were there.  Guess I'll still have to drive 15 minutes down to Chandler rather than 5 minutes to Mesa for Hodori.

Have gone here well over 2 dozen times over the past year or so and always had a good experience.  Very helpful and knowledgeable staff.    I like to get smaller things.  One is for price but the main reason is it is easier to dig a small hole and if it doesn't last, it wasn't a big investment anyway.  Have I planted things that have died?  Yes.  Have I taken them back and made a stink?  No, because I killed them.  If that is not your style, and are like my mom who will dig something out of the ground 1yr later and return it, a big box store is probably the best bet.  The independent places sell more 1 gallon and smaller items because they don't have as much overhead.  I got a few 1ft tall saguaros for $10.  Not many places have them that small.    I will be getting a few trees (Chinese Elm) this fall and this will be my first stop.  As with most small local places, the more you get familiar with them, the better the experience will be.  I also checked out the location in Gilbert, slightly more selection, same friendly staff.

They close at 5 30 and I made it there at 5:27.  I run up to the door and.... it's locked.  If you close before 5 30 than change your hours to reflect that!      Worst part is I saw someone inside, obviously not doing anything, and they didn't acknowledge me as if it is normal for people to stand bewildered in front of their store.    I knew exactly what I wanted and would have been out in a no time.  If you plan on going near close make sure to call ahead and make sure the employees aren't trying to duck out early.

Came here based on a recommendation from a coworker.  Took me a few years to be in the area, and try it out.  The place is quaint, friendly staff.  Almost everyone there was eating breakfast at 4pm on a sunday, but I was there for a burger.  Little strong on the mayo, but otherwise it was quite tasty.  I think the key to a good burger is not overthinking it, with fancy this or that.  slap a piece of american cheese on it, some lettuce/tomato/onions for crispness and you are in good shape.  I added some green chilis to mine.    I won't be traveling from tempe all the way out here, but if I am in the area, I will definitely stop by if I'm in the mood for a burger.  Very friendly staff is always a plus too.

Found this place b/c of Yelp and glad I did.  Great Sonoran hot dogs.  I got two and was uber full.  The first time I went I recall less than optimal communication.  I asked how many types of dogs they had, and the answer was "how many?".    Today was the 2nd time and things went much better.  Very helpful and once again a great meal.  I also feel like it was a bit cleaner this time, maybe they straightened up or repainted.  It is in a below average neighborhood but worth the adventure.  Go for the food, not the ambiance.

I went here towards the end of the lunch hour push and it was still quite busy.  The line wasn't long, but most of the tables were full which is a good sign.  It is in a tricky parking lot, be prepared to pass it and whip a U-turn.    Everything seems to be cooked up nice and fresh so it took a few minutes to get our dish.  Upon arrival, I received a plate overflowing with food.  I got the Beef Bulgoki and Pork Katsu (sp?) combo plate.  I have had both of those meats at a Korean place (Cho Dang) so I assume that is the influence on these particular meats.  Both were very good.  A tiny bittle too gristly on the bulgoki, but it was easily cut off and the flavor was good enough to make it not worry.    I chose my side to be maccaroni potato salad.  Yes, both combined into one which sounds a little sacrilegious but it was recommend by the woman taking my order.  It was actually very good.  The entire meal was very good and even someone with a healthy appetite like me was unable to even come close to finishing.  They pile the meat on top of 2 giant scoops of rice so it is definitely healthy portioning at this joint.  Compared to the awful food I had at Paradise Hawaiian BBQ in Tempe, this place is at a different level.  I actually got more food, fresher food, and tastier food for less money.    The place was clean and the staff was friendly.  I look forward to going back to work my way through the menu.

After searching Yelp for a good breakfast option I chose Cracker & Co.  The place was busy but not chaotic.  Tables weren't jam packed together which isn't always the case for breakfast joints.  We went around the time the after church folks probably go.  We were seated promptly and quickly placed our drink orders.  I chose the Onassis omelet with a side of pancakes (+ strawberries and whip cream).  Not sure what my girlfriend got but she enjoyed hers.  I knew I couldn't finish all that I ordered so I focused on the pancakes, they were very tasty.  The omelet was good but the potatoes on the side were great.  They were thinly sliced instead of little cubes like most places.  We both have plenty of food leftover that we took it home.    In all, with a coffee, OJ, and our meals it was around $25.  My pancakes were an extra $1 and so were the strawberries and whip cream.  Best breakfast I have had in town and we tried out Brunchie's once from the rave reviews on here.  If you want an overrated breakfast joint, go there.  Way too busy and loud with slightly above average food, but nothing unique.  I doubt I'll go back there even though it is  mile from my gf's house.  But we will definitely make the 3 mile trip up to Crackers and Co. Café.      The person that complained about a $25 breakfast for 2 two being expensive needs to join the rest of us in the 21st Century.  2 coffees cost $5, the Crab Eggs Benedict isn't even on the menu so either it doesn't exist or was a daily special.  Everyone knows daily specials tend to be pricier, especially if you add seafood to it.  Who orders crab with breakfast anyway?  If you expect real lump crabmeat at a breakfast joint than you shouldn't be eating and ordering it.  Either way that makes your breakfasts about $9 each (left room for tax), since when is that outrageous?  If you want to eat off the Value Meal I am sure McDonald's will be happy to take your order.

Pita Jungle is one of the best deals for food in town.  Very fresh ingredients and large portions for a great price.  I rarely if ever finish even half of my meal which gives me lunch for the next day.  I've had ever appetizer and they are all solid.  The nachos are a meal in itself.  They have tons of vegetarian options for those that don't eat meat or folks like me that want a break from it every once in a while.    We never pay more than $30 for 2 people and that includes two meals an appetizer and a couple of iced teas.  The place is very laid back and attracts a wide range of characters.  Someone forgot to tell them there is a recession, very busy during dinner time.  The food always comes out quick though.    Pita Jungle is in the weekly rotation for us due to the selection, affordability, and casual atmosphere.

I have lived here for nearly 10 years.  I acquired my sushi addiction back in NY/NJ and am always in search of some good quality fish.  Most places in AZ are a dime a dozen.  Nothing special, completely average and nothing to separate one from another.  But, then there is Shimogamo.  I have been here 10+ times.  This is my base for top notch sushi.  I have not been disappointed yet and I have tried a majority of their raw offerings.  Sit at the bar, grab a beer, some cold sake and prepare to have a food-gasm.  Their happy hour (7-days a week) prices are awesome.  Lots of nigiri, rolls, beer/sake and appetizers to choose from on that menu.  For the best eats, the list to focus on is the board behind the bar.  It has all their weekly specials.  The freshest items they get will be listed up there.  Do not hesitate to try new things.  Bonus points about this place is that the owner is Japanese!  Even back east that is a rarity.  Koreans (and even Chinese) own a large percentage of sushi joints.    The chefs here are great at just making something unique for you that isn't on the menu.  We usually get a round of some of our favorites, then let them freestyle the rest of the way.    Don't confuse pricey with over priced.  Great fresh fish is not cheap.  There are plenty of cheap sushi joints with all you can eat and less than stellar grades of fish.  If you always strive for better sushi and aren't content with the imitation crab (Krab = whitefish) that nearly 100% of other places use, step into the big leagues with Shimogamo.

2 Parts to the review:  The infamous man, and the food.  The food:  Reviews speak for themselves.  We got a few of the staples.  THe teriyaki chicken (added veggies) and the yakisoba for me.  Both portions were GIGANTIC and delicious.  We also shared a crab cake.  Took half of our large size orders home.  Teriyaki Chicken had a great crispiness/smokiness to it.  The hot sauce or chili oil they have adds a lot of flavor but is quite mild on the hot category, it was quite good too.  To the infamous gentleman taking the order:  I read the reviews and saw he came highly regarded.  Even warned my gf that people love this guy so we were expecting a large personality.  This guy is a charmer.  Really makes you feel at home.  Everyone is all smiles when ordering.  Doesn't hurt that he is delivering tasty food also.  Pricing is very affordable.  It was $20 for us with our 2 large entrees, a drink and the appetizer.  Would be under $15 with just the meals.    The whole experience was awesome.  He predicted we would be back after trying the Teriyaki chicken, and I wouldn't bet against him.

Unfortunately this place has been poor the past 2 times we have gotten take out.  Old Guy hasn't been there either time, so I'm wondering if new ownership or management.  this evening we go it, and the Chicken Teriyaki is the worst I've ever had.  Maybe they ran out of Teriyaki sauce, and figured they could sneak in Aunt Jamima's in, but wow is it bad.  This ultra sugary fake maple syrup flavor is dreadful.  Will have to explore other options, 2 strikes, and you're out with us.

Every review talks about the good food but let's start elsewhere, the bathrooms.  The bathroom is unisex sinks with separate doors for each stall.  Each room has it's own theme and music.  I love the creativity in something so often overlooked by most restaurants.    I've been here twice and had a great experience both times.  The first time I got the Italia Salad.  It was very large with lots of meat and cheese.  It was very tasty.  I followed that up by an ice cream sandwich which was at least 4x too big for me.  The cookie was fresh and warm with the ice cream wedged in between.  I say that baby is fit for 2 large adults or 3-4 people that know their limit.  The 2nd time I got the Italia sandwich.  It was fantastic.  The potato salad I chose as a side was good too.  Too often places overcook the hell out of the potatoes and it turns into mush.  Theirs still had some texture which was nice.  It was a very satisfying meal.  We chased our dish with their signature espresso which is a micro latte (two baby lattes).   I love the uniqueness of the original brick wall, and the exposed wooden trusses that make up the roof.  Even the seemingly simple light bulbs are unique with a hoop-earring looking filament within them.  They have a brick oven for pizzas and a huge display for those tempting deserts.  In addition to the espresso bar they also have a nice selection of beer and wine.  This is a great lunch spot in an area of town not known for independent and unique dining options.    Worth the drive from Tempe.  It often is quite busy but they are good at cleaning tables and reserving seats for people in line.

This place has a great selection.  Check out there website, they have almost everything.  They don't have a ton on display in the humidor in the main building compared to what they have but don't worry, their warehouse is where it is at.  I suggest picking out a few things online, writing them down and then letting them grab them for you from the warehouse.  This place can be overwhelming if you don't have an idea in mind.  On the bright side the employees I have dealt with (in person and on the phone) have been some of the friendliest in town.  They can always throw out suggestions or chat a little as you are checking out their selection  Their smoking rooms look great if that is your thing.  Tons of seating and TVs.  Their man cave is insane.  10-20 couches/chairs and probably just an many TVs.  If you have buddies that smoke cigars, this is a place to enjoy one at.  Their ventilation seemed really good when I walked through the rooms which can't be said about all cigar shops.  I think their man cave has an open door to bring in fresh air from outside.    They have a great selection of watches, lighters, and cutters.  I can guarantee no one has their selection.  Their prices are competitive with the biggest online retailers (prices advertised online do not include AZ tobacco taxes).  They offer tons of singles, 5 packs, boxes and bundles.  An all around great cigar shop.

Have to up this to 4, we eat there too much.  The best pizza ever?  Certainly not.  Do I like the conveyor belt instead of the pizza oven?  No sir.  But when we need a quick slice this is where we go.    If it is time to get a full pie, that is what Spinato's is for.  But for a quick slice?  This can't be beat.  Tried hitting up a few places in Mesa to find them a complete dud.  I always leave full and satisfied here.  Always quick to take the order and get you the food.  Place is always PACKED.    After another 20-30 visits I may swallow my NJ pride and give this place 5 stars.

I read all the bad reviews, so I was hesitant to go.  But a coworker/friend is a member, and the gun store I go to reassured me it is a good place, but they do not mess around when it comes to safety.  So I took my chances, and boy were the bad reviews a reflection on the reviewers, more so than this establishment.  You will have an absolute blast!  Are they strict on safety?  Of course!  is that a bad thing?  uhhh... I like living... so no.  I was very clear with the RO at check in, and each guy I passed that I was a first timer at that facility, and was shooting a new gun that I was unfamiliar with.  They were more than helpful.   Did they have to correct me a time or two?  absolutely.  Were completely respectful and polite.  Were there some folks that kept being corrected for the same thing like messing with crap on the bench during cease fire?  Yes.  Were they yelled at or kicked out?  No.  I can't imagine how arrogant/ignorant/rude the people that have had bad experiences at this place are.  Probably good that the ROs ran off those types, as they ruin it for people that are looking to responsibly enjoy ourselves.  If you have no qualms with safety, etiquette, and following like 5 rules (point gun down range at all times, don't cross line during cease fire, and leave bolt open for inspection, eye & ear protection) then you will have a blast.  If that is too much to ask... do the rest of us a favor and go elsewhere or even better, sell your guns to someone who is more responsible.  Next time I plan on hitting up the trap range.  Great pricing, great facility and much closer to me (tempe) than Ben Avery.

I decided to branch out and try a new Korean place.  I wanted to see how good/bad my usual place (Cho Dang) was.  I wasn't surprised to find out that Cho Dang is in a league of its own when it comes to Korean BBQ in CHandler.  Takamatsu was as underwhelming as it gets.  The decor is like a cafeteria.  Patrons are very loud.  It seems that everyone goes there for the all you can eat sushi.  The person who sat us thought we were there for it and our server did a triple take when we didn't have anything filled out on the sushi form.  Call me a sushi snob all you want, but I don't go to a Korean place to get my fix, and if I did, I wouldn't go to an all you can eat place.  I'm not trying to maximize calories, I am trying to maximize flavor.  We ordered two dishes we routinely get at Cho Dang, Bulgogi and another dish. we had some miso soup that was included which was good.  That is literally impossible to screw up because it comes from either a powder or a cube.  No points for not screwing that up.    Out came the sides and the dishes.  This is when it got very disappointing.  The sides were inedible.  Most were very bland while others were just bad.  I don't think any side was edible.  The bulgogi was decent, but still not as good as I'm used to.  The other dish was poorly executed and just tasted bad.    Overall, the place was really bad.  They deserve 1 star but if I could I would be generous and give them a 1.5 stars because we ate the bulgogi and didn't leave completely unsatisfied.  I'll never go back considering there is Korean food that is in a different league just down the street on Ray and Arizona.    This place looked like a chinese buffet, and the food execution was on the same level.  I didn't see a single Korean there eating which is a bad sign.  I saw a ton of wannabe sushi eaters, a few SE-Asians and several old people.   I gave it a shot once and won't be back.  Worst Korean food I've ever eaten without question.  Yelp reviewers are really starting to get a bad rap with me.  If this is the best Korean BBQ you have had, what places could possibly be worse?

For the price, the wine isn't bad.  They advertise it being a local winery but I think it mostly come from New Mexico.    If you want decent AZ wine check out the selection at WF or AJ's.  They have some that are much better for about the same price.    The food is okay, but definitely over priced because a majority of their clientele are tourists.  They have had a buy one entree get one free, and half price wine with live music promo on Tuesday's.  That got us in to give it another try.  You soon find out it only applies to pasta dishes and pot roast.  Nowhere does it say that on any of the ads that are at the table, online, or the sign out front.  The first time we went it was alright and half off was a good deal.  The second time the server told us we had to order the same meal.  Sure doesn't say that anywhere either.  Due to that little scam, I will not be going back.  The service has always been mediocre here (bordering on bad) but I am more lenient with small local businesses.   I guess you aren't supposed to be in a rush when drinking wine anyway right?  If I need a drink in downtown Chandler I will stick with San Tan Brewery.

The place is a little small, so selection is somewhat limited.  But, you have a lot of the big hitters to choose from.  They don't have a lot of space designated to non-cigar stuff.  Just a few humidors and that's it.  The entire place is the humidor so there is no lounge.  They do have a few chairs outside with ashtrays you can enjoy your cigar at if you want.  Price is typically the main issue with cigar shops and they are as competitively priced as any that I've checked out.  Your one cigar purchase does not have to absorb the costs of a fancy lounge, or an oversized  rental property.  This place is lean and mean, 100% humidor.  Their prices are good probably because they have several locations and have much more buying power that you would think at their small storefronts.    I've been here twice, and both times the guys helping were very helpful, talkative and made for a good shopping experience.  (As an aside, I think they pump pure oxygen in there because I leave way to happy/wired when I leave.)    They also have a great deal on used boxes if you need them for anything.  extras go to a good cause as well.  Some cigar shops try using the boxes as a revenue stream by charging $5ea which is certainly over the top.  All you need at a local cigar shop is someone who knows their cigars, can chat you up while you look, and allows you to chose at your own pace.  This place has done that for me thus far and I will continue to go back.

The place has a nice little vibe going on and they have some unique items but the reason the rating is so low is that there really aren't a lot of options that don't involve faux meat.  Aren't these people vegan?  Don't they hate the idea of poor little animals being our food (even though that is the only reason they are alive)?  Then why so much FAKE MEAT?!    I will never understand the meat envy vegans and vegetarians have.  I go to a place like this to get a dish that uses vegetables in more creative ways, not to get some overly processed soy products that aren't nearly as healthy as fresh lean meats like chicken and fish.  FYI, I love meat but every once in a while I like to grab a vegetarian dish.    Another negative is nearly everything is fried.  Guess they bust the myth that people are vegan because it is healthier.  Frying things is the cheap way out of actually creating a healthy AND tasty meal.    I'll give them a 2.5 star because what we chose was quite tasty.  But with nearly every option involving faux meat and tofu it really is a disappointment.  If you want legitimate vegan fare try out some indian places or Ethiopian places.  They are very creative and using spices to flavor a vegetable dish. The fake cheeses and meats are for Vegans with meat envy, not for Omnivores that just want a good meal.  Keep your expectations in check and you should be okay.

I was first brought here by a friend from Saudi Arabia many years ago.  He didn't question my selection of burger joints, I didn't question his selection of Middle Eastern Food.  What this place lacks in decor and atmosphere, it makes up in flavor.    You literally eat in the middle of a small grocery market.  Bizarre?  Yes.  A deal breaker?  Not when these flavors await.      We got a mixed platter that gave us a little of everything, and it was all quite good.The two of us took quite a bit of leftovers home.  I've always had a good meal each time I've gone here and if they had better hours I would go more often.   Tempe is Phoenix's hub for Middle Eastern fare, and Haji-Baba is one of the best.

I knew this place had poor reviews before Yelp was even around but was in the area in search of food. I improvised and went to one of the first places nearby.  I ordered a combo that was 2 pieces of fish, 7 shrimp, fries and a drink.  Came out to just under $10.  For price comparison, the same thing at Long John Silver would be $5-6.  The shrimp were flat out awful.  They butterfly the shrimp to make it look bigger and then overload it with heavy batter before frying it.  I removed one of the shrimp from the breading and noticed it was probably 10 times smaller than the amount of batter used.  They use realllllly small shrimp, like 50-100 ct used in cheap shrimp cocktail platters at the grocery store.    The fries are below average.  If you are going to have "chips" in your name, you need to have some of the best fries around.  They do not.     Their fish was okay because it wasn't overly greasy but again their breading is so thick and heavy it ruins it.  Fried fish should have a light batter.  In fact, nothing should ever be fried in the batter they use.  To top it off, their fish is served in the most natural of shapes.... a square.  If I want awkward looking fish, I'll head to the frozen section and get some fish sticks.    I saved the worst for part of the meal for last.  Their signature sauce.  That stuff was awful.  It tasted like it was 50% water and 45% ketchup and 5% vinegar.  They don't give you any tartar sauce, no malt vinegar and nickel and dime you for sauces on the menu.  I figured some other staples for this type of meal would be included but I was wrong.  I didn't even get to drown the bad food in a decent sauce, it was just more mediocrity.    On to the most obvious quirk about the place, cash only.  If you are a cash only joint I assume you are trying to save the fees associated with accepting them and keeping your prices down.  Then why is the food so expensive?  It certainly isn't high quality.  It certainly isn't any good.    Bad fish + bad shrimp + bad sauce + bad fries = 1 star.

I knew of Cafe Boa for a while now but didn't know much about it, and didn't really think about trying it until I stumbled across an article in the College Times.  It was about "locavores" and one of the people focused on was the Execute Chef at Cafe Boa.  After seeing that local products are emphasized by him, and his menu I figured I needed to try this place out.  It was a tad fancier and pricier than I was expecting.  A place with the name Cafe in it should have fairly inexpensive meals.  But, this is not the case here.  However, the food was well worth the price.  If you don't appreciate high quality ingredients like, freshly made pasta, wild caught fish, or grass fed meat then you may not get the same value out of the meal as someone who does.  An honest review should be pointing this out instead of just complaining about the price.      We had a Mozzarella, marinated peppers, and crostini appetizer.  Locally sourced milk that they use to make their own mozzarella.  It was all very tasty.  For our entrees I had a putanesca pasta with added shrimp.  The gf had the gnocchi with added goat cheese.  Both were DELICIOUS.  All of their ingredients are top notch and well worth the extra buck they may cost.  Portions are a decent size and we had plenty to take home with us.  I went in expecting a quaint little cafe and was treated to a fantastic meal that exceeded my expectations.  They wine list is quite long and their seasonal menu should make each visit a unique one.  It may not be a weekly spot to grab a bite but when if I want a place for a nice meal, this will always be in the running.

I asked the girl behind the register what there most popular BBQ is.  She told me that their Italian Beef was popular.  When I try a place for the first time I like to have their signature food, because if that is no good the rest will be even worse.  There was only one other group of people there but it was midday so that isn't always a sign of anything.  I got my sandwich fairly quickly which is to be expected for food that is already made.  That is when the experience went down hill.  Apparently they marinate their bread in Au Jus because it was overwhelmingly soggy.  I brought it back up and said it was very soggy, and she informed me they often put some juice on it.  That may be the case but a freshly made sandwich does not get soggy within a minute.  That leads me to believe it was already made before I got it.  I got a replacement one, hold the JUICE.  This time it was a normal sandwich and the new problem was that it had zero taste.  It was the driest most flavorless beef sandwich I've eaten before.  I think I also got some potato salad which was mediocre as well.  Overall, the worst BBQ place I've been too.  I'm not surprised because Chicago people can't do anything right.  They screwed up pizza and the hot dog.  Which makes me wonder, why are Chicago people obsessed with reinventing the wheel?  Good BBQ already exists, no need to Chicago-style it and make it bad.  Good pizza is from NY, no need to add a few pounds of soggy deep-dish dough to screw it up.  If you're hot dogs were so good, why do you hide it under so many condiments?  Rant over.  Note to self, avoid anything that Chicago stole from another region and tries to claim it.

Yelp, I cannot think of the words necessary to express my disappointment.  This was not only the worst seafood I have eaten in my life, but by far the worst Mexican food as well.  What are you people smoking?  We started with a few beers, can't screw that one up.  I ordered an appetizer that was completely not as described but I should have known better since it was in the cold section of the appetizers.  It sure didn't say raw oysters, raw shrimp, octopus, and thawed shrimp in a crappy broth.  All for $15?  As if there wasn't enough lack of texture with those ingredients, they throw avocado on top.  Yeah, that will round out the dish.  I am not even completely factoring that into the rating because I should have paid more attention to it being cold.  For my meal I got Marlin Machaca.  What kind of seafood joint serves you shredded fish?  Is it marlin or Tuna?  Why the hell would I want my fish shredded?  On top of that the flavors were just bad.  It was either canned, or just not fresh.  How can you call this place a seafood establishment when they rape the fish so badly?  It came with refried beans, white rice with frozen peas and carrots, and a pile of raw iceberg lettuce.  Why are they adding frozen veggies to the rice?  It doesn't bring me comfort to know they aren't cooking anything fresh.  And why the nasty white iceberg in clumps?  The beans were good and they gave us tortillas so I spent the meal making little tacos and seeing which hot sauce covered up the poor flavors the best.  The other victim ordered the "fish".  How much less information can they provide.  It was a choice between sea bass or Tilapia.  Since Tilapia is a FRESHWATER fish, they lose points and really expose themselves as a fraud.  Hers was much better than mine, but nothing worthy of  taking it home leftovers or ever returning.     Bill totaled out to $50+!!  For Mexican food, and terrible Mexican food at that!  Food was awful, prices were outrageous, it was in the cesspool that is Guadalupe, how much worse can it get?  I should have listened to my inner voice that said nothing good happens in Guadalupe.  It is an unbelievable little place.  The instant you cross over from Tempe to the Guad the road turns to crap with potholes and bumps everywhere.  Businesses vanish, and homes are replaced with shacks.  Minimal street lights and overall maintenance and infrastructure make you feel like 2012 has already arrived.  The best part of our journey was driving away, seemingly crossing an imaginary line of civilization and being back in Tempe at AZ Mills Mall.  Not sure what the expectations are for the other reviewers, but I expect fresh food from the sea.  Much of what we ate was probably out of a can like the octopus, oysters, and the marlin.  The shrimp were most likely frozen and/or precooked.    Saturday night, there was one couple eating there, and a bunch of drunks outside playing the guitar.  That says more about this place than the unexplainable positive reviews on here.  I will never be able to look at Yelp reviews the same way again...  ... The one positive I take from this experience is that I saw a hot dog cart and a taco cart as I left the Guad.  I may have to hit up the taco cart in the future.  (EDIT: I wonder why the other bad review for this place has been hidden.  I should have weighed his opinion more heavily, would have saved me a bad experience and some cash)

We went here on a Sunday afternoon which is a time Gilbert doesn't have a lot of anything going on.  The place has plenty of seating and the staff was helpful.  I ordered a meat variety dish that included 2 pork ribs, pulled pork, beaf brisket, and smoked chicken.  Keep in mind they smoke all of their meats.  It will taste like smoke.  There is a review of someone complaining about smoke taste.  To avoid that, stay away form smoked foods, not complicated!    The ribs were pretty good, the pulled pork was as well.  The brisket was a bit dry and was better with some extra BBQ sauce.  The chicken was dry in some spots but better in others.  I would prefer a BBQ joint that does more BBQ-ing than smoking, .  Smoked meat is okay but I would prefer more traditional BBQ.  Their baked beans were pretty good, and the potato salad was average.  It was a solid meal with good portions.  The most interesting part of the experience is that the bathroom is very smokey smelling.  I don't know if it doubles as a room for cooking the meat but it sure is odd.  My gf said the women's room was smokey too.     Overall, nothing spectacular but still a decent experience.  Will I go back?  Doubtful.  I don't live that close and there are many other places closer and if I do go that direction I may drive a few more feet to Oregano's.

I've been here a few times and couldn't resist the temptation when I saw a yelp deal for Phoenicia.  I'm a huge fan of this style of food and they do everything very well here.  The two times I have come here my gf and I split some ginormous sampler for 2 (or more realistically - 4).  You get to try almost everything and it is all very good.  We took 2 full large containers home as leftover, and leave stuffed for around $30 when adding in our iced teas.  The yelp deal dropped that down considerably.  But, I have paid full price for it before, and I will again, it was just icing on the cake I got it on sale.    I don't have to send a lot of time describing the food, most people know the main stuff.  It is all quite tasty here and the service is always top notch.  Meat is moist, and everything has good flavor.  What more are we looking for, right?  There is some high quality places in the area and I think Phoenicia holds its own.  I literally drive past 5-10 of them to get here, that must say something.

I first went to the Mesa location but had to try the original one.  I was surprised to see that both places are very slim and long.  This location is very small.  How small you ask?  Small enough that the staff constantly has to stop what they are doing to step aside and let other coworkers pass.  They were good at it though.  I love trying different types of food, and if it's a small local I am definitely in.  After checking out the rave reviews I gave them a shot.  I loved my pasty (Pass-tee) at both locations but I was denied the shepards pie one in Mesa because they were out.  I lucked out and finally got it at this location.  Boy was that good.  Ground lamb just has a better flavor note to it that beef doesn't bring to the table.  We also had a little half salad and some roasted potatoes.  Both were tasty and the roasted potatoes have a coat of fresh thyme on them and didn't have the fat and grease factor of fries.  In a place this small it is impossible to have bad service.  You can literally reach out and tap the staff if you feel neglected, that is how close they are.  Why do they get minus a star?  Because I am 6'5" and had to assume a yoga pose that I am neither familiar with, nor comfortable performing due to the closeness of the stool to the bar.  I could have chosen a table, but I live to drink in the experience.    They have several beers to choose from, bonus points for not having American piss water on tap and having a little variety.  The place is very casual with some personality too.    A little tip for those like me who broke the record for most U-turns within a 100 yards.  The place faces west on the NE side of the intersection between University and Hardy.  A little tricky at night because the sign may not be on and the little shopping center address isn't lit up either.    Great food, friendly and social staff.  Unique little place.  What more do you want?

I went here several years ago and, while still not good, it was tolerable in the non-swimming area.   1 - It looks like that haven't watered the grass since then because it was in bad shape when I first went there, and a few years later it is gone.  And by gone I mean 90% of it is dirt.  Minus 1 star  2 - There aren't any trees in to provide shade, the only option is a covered picnic area with 4 tables on the non-lake side.  That will be a problem once it gets warmer.  Being in the middle of the desert, shade should be a priority because we are known for our 100+ temps for nearly half the year.  minus 1 star  3 - No one that goes to Cosmo picks up poop.  Maybe it is that by being well known it attracts people that just don't belong at dog parks.  Whoever they are out in Gilbert, inconsiderate and poor etiquette are the norm, not the exception apparently.  There was a nice senior gentleman picking up the insane amounts of poo with the scooper to make it tolerable in the lake area.  There were literally hundreds of poops in the other side that no one picked up in the several hours I was there.  There were probably 20-40 poops I passed on the walk from the parking lot to the park.      -1  4 - With popularity comes the morons.  You think managing a double gate and understanding its purpose would be fairly self explanatory.  WRONG!  When I arrived and left people just stood there with the doors open letting everyone's dogs get into the holding pen area and then leaving them in there.  After watching the circus for about 30 seconds each time I had to tell the people to just get out of the way.  There is no reason to hold the gate for someone so 10 dogs can pile up and come close to running away.  At the usual parks I go to I've never had this problem.  (I won't mention those in fear that the Cosmo hoard will take over my parks)      -1  5 - The parking situation is a mess.  The park is huge, popularity is very high and they have very limited spots (maybe 30?) and the lot is about 100-150 yards away from the park entrance.  Obviously not a deal breaker since you are there to exercise you and your pet but certainly not convenient.  -1    6 - The lake side has the pro of gravel so there is no mud, and no grass for them to screw up by not watering it.  My dogs don't swim, but they have a habit of nibbling on poop which is why I was forced to bring them to the water side to avoid the proliferation of land mines.  +1   7 - There is a little dog area.  Therefore people with little dogs can't complain about how the big dogs are... you know... acting like regular dogs. +1     That leaves me with 2 stars.  If your dog doesn't swim, don't waste your time, even if you live within walking distance.  Of the 6 or so dog parks I've gone to in town this is by far the worst maintained by the city but more importantly it has the patrons with the worst etiquette.  Too bad because it has huuuuuge potential.

Bright Pink Ginger is all I need to say to describe this place.  The rest of the experience was similar.  Food was blah, I was disappointed with one roll in particular because the soft shell crab was obviously not freshly fried, or even reheated.  It was cold, limp, and soggy.    The rest of the food experience was average.  Service at the bar was good.  Too many other better sushi joints closer to my house for me to go back.  Bright pink ginger and best sushi in the valley are mutually exclusive.

I would like the place more if they were opened past lunch hours.  I don't work in the neighborhood and only get to go on an off-day.  Their sandwiches are delicious and they have a solid variety.  The sandwiches may look simple on the menu but you can add a bunch of veggies to really flavor it up.    The style is a seat yourself, and wait for the food to arrive type.  I like the laid back style, nice decor, and fresh and delicious food.  Owner is super friendly and appreciates the customer.  Each time I have gone I wonder why I don't go more often, then I realize the hours.  I only give it 4.9 stars for not staying open long enough to allow me to eat there every meal!  Fresh bread, and meat and veggies.  What more can you ask?  I can't wait to try new things on the menu.    To the person who complained about the price of a bagel-egg-cheese sandwich I would like to remind you that it is a BREAD COMPANY not a bagel shop!  I would have charged you $10 bucks for being silly enough to order the bagel.  2nd of all, no one ever asks you what kind of cheese you want on a bagel, it is always American by default, even at a bagel shop.  If you wanted something different then ask, they do not read minds.

I stopped in to just talk with the owner and had a great time learning from him and picking his brain.  I did not buy any cigars since I'm new to the cigar game and wouldn't appreciate the finer points in a quality cigar.      The cigars he makes are made from 15-40 year old leaves and he prices them at $1/yr.  Yes they are pricey.  But, how many people can buy a cigar and be able to point out the guy that made it?  most cigars don't use tobacco aged that much either.    He let me smell the cigars that used the 15, 20, 25, and 30 year old tobacco and it was completely different than the $10 cigars from a regular shop.  They smelled amazing.   He is moving to Scottsdale at the end of the month.  Scottsdale rd and Camelback are the cross streets.  My hunch is that is better location than off the beaten path in downtown Mesa.  Mesa certainly isn't known for it's hopping downtown or its cigar enthusiasts....     Once he moves I am going to try and catch a cigar rolling demonstration.  Super friendly guy.   (For some reason Price ranges on tobacco shops isn't by price.  $$=15-30 for restaurants, so it is appropriate for this place since his range is $15-40)

I bought a bike 1 week before taking the course, and only drove around my neighborhood to figure it out.  This course did a lot to teach about safety and how best to react to certain situations.  The driving portion is tricky when you try something for the first time but they are great at allowing practice and telling you the right techniques.  I took it in August which is not the best weather when wearing a helmet, long pants, boots, gloves, and a long sleeve shirt.    The best part about it is you take your course completion form to the DMV and a few minutes later you get a new license.  If you don't own a motorcycle, how would you pass the driving test anyway?    Icing on the cake is that certain Insurances will provide a discount (Progressive is one) with completion of the course.

I love Cho Dang and have had a good meal every time I have been there.  The first time we were there the server spoke perfect english (not always a guarantee here) and was able to explain to us what was popular and some of her favorites.  If we didn't have this help we may not have had as good of an experience.  With this in mind, let me suggest a first time meal for those that want to try this place out.  I go with my girlfriend and we usually get 2 meals and split them.  Order 1 tofu soup (dumpling and mushroom are our favorites) and order the Beef Bulgogi (Korean BBQ).  They will ask if you want an egg in your soup, go for it!  Rice made in a stone bowl comes with soup and regular rice comes with the Bulgogi.  The sides that come with it are great too.  You do not get to choose, they come with the meal so don't review the place and complain about not having a choice.  They give you 6 and they will fill them up if you need more.  They are very fresh too.  If you enjoy the first meal and want to go back I suggest always ordering one new item and one you know is good.  That way you can experiment but not ruin the experience with 2 new dishes you may not enjoy.  There are a few soup-type dishes I really enjoy as well as a dumpling dish.  The staff is friendly, attentive and if they aren't there is a button at the table to summon them!    I see what I assume are Koreans there all the time and we are often the only ones that aren't.  We are kind of regulars and they know of us as the ones who love the seaweed.  By seaweed I mean the side that is wet and in a mild vinegar-y liquid.  I order extra when I get take-out because it is so yummy.  Sometimes they make a sesame flavored seaweed for the side that isn't as tasty.  Either way, I have been here no less than 30 times and I enjoy myself every time.  I leave satisfied, stuffed, and with a healthy portion of leftovers.  And for how much?  Usually in the $20-30 range for 2 meals, 2 iced teas, and the included sides.    From the location and the outside it isn't anything special.  But it is a nice little oasis in the middle of El Chandlero.

I used to eat here several years ago in their other location and when they first moved into the current location.  It was always good food, it just somehow fell off my Mediterranean food list with so many choices around the Tempe area.  But, I made sure to go recently and I was reminded why I enjoyed it so much before.  It also made me wonder why I haven't chosen it more often for this style of food.  They were doing a buffet but we could also still order off the menu.  I don't know if they do this often or if it was just a welcoming back to ASU type of thing but we chose to the buffet  to try some new dishes.  It was all very tasty.  Of course there was some pita and hummus and then some rice.  They had a stewed lamb dish and one that was stewed chicken.  Both were very flavorful.  THey also has a rice and chicken dish and a rice and lamb dish.  With all of the meets being bone-in, they really infused some great flavors.    There was a custardy desert that the server said said was made with rosewater, it was very sweet.  I typically don't like custards for texture reasons so I am not one to judge their quality.  I just wanted to give everything available an honest try.    I usually try to keep my portions under control and always leave a place with leftovers but this food was tasty enough for me to go back for 2nds.  With all the great Mediterranean food in close proximity it's hard to stand out, but this place is worthy of being in the rotation.

While the square footage of their humidor may not match up to some other stores in town, they stock theirs up about 9ft so they have plenty to offer.  I think their selection is better than all of the ones in the SE valley.  They don't stock every single cigar offered by 4 brands like many do, but they give a potpourri from many brands.    The humidor itself is quite dark, and seeing what is on the lower shelves and ground is a little tough.  It is also very tight in there, with no room for someone to walk by you.  If someone is in with you be prepared to back up or move forward to let people slide by.  That isn't a big issue, I'd rather space be taken up by cigars than wide aisles anyway.    There is a lot of area to enjoy a cigar if that is your thing.  I saw a man on a bar table with his computer and some high school / freshman looking punks smoking a cigarette on the couch.  (Quick question:  Who goes to a cigar shop to smoke a cigarette?)      They sell several expensive humidors, lighters, and cutters if that is your thing.  One very cool item they have near the register is a custom made cutter for the in-house smokers.    The negatives with this place are that they were a little expensive from some other places I've checked prices at.  Also, if you are in the market for a used cigar box, steer clear.  They charge $5ea!  No wonder they have 100-200 stacked up.  Apparently making a few hundred from what was in the box isn't enough.  Most charge $2ea, some less.  It isn't something for me to boycott the place over but I'll stick to the more customer friendly shops and head over here if they don't have what I'm looking for.

Just went here looking to find some things that my regular places don't stock and stumbled into a fantastic surprise.  It is under new ownership and went from one of the more expensive places to one of the cheaper.    Stock has improved as well.  I noticed the giant stack of empty boxes that were for sale for $5 before is gone.  Maybe they charge less or just give them away.    Definitely going to visit here more than once a year with the new improvements.

One of the best selections out there, and a very personable staff.  Not to mention the great Yelp deal I got.  There is a reason they are one of the few places still around from when I moved here over a decade ago.

If you are a beer snob, stay at home trying to make it yourself.  If you enjoy a decent local beer in an old chandler building with a nice atmosphere give this place a shot.  The owner used to be a brew-master at Four Peaks Brewery which is a local favorite in Tempe.    I am not a fan of the over-the-top Hops that a lot of folks enjoy.  A few of the offerings here have a bit too much bite for me.  The red ale was my favorite until they changed the recipe and over did the bitterness.  Right now I get a Sun Devil Ale when I go in and it is pretty good.  They will bring you a taster if you ask and will explain the offerings to help you choose.      The food is always good.  It is a bar so don't expect 5 star cuisine.  The fries are great and the sandwiches and salads are good as well.  I haven't been disappointed with a meal yet.  Even when busy service is decent.  Enjoy the beer, watch the game and let it all unfold.

The concept is awesome, the execution is average.  It is nothing more than typical grocery store food for a few less dollars.  You don't get to pick what you get so spending a few bucks at the store to get what you want is enticing to many.  There is zero effort on getting the goods locally.  I have gotten garlic from China (they grow it here in AZ as well as other parts of N. America) and avocados from Chile (isn't Cali famous for them?).    Other reviewers, the message board on the site, and the people who run the site like to say they buy the same food as other stores like Sprouts.  No chance.  They also claim to buy local when it is available but the summer isn't the AZ grow season (their words).  Go to Whole Foods and check out the local produce they have, apparently they forgot about no growing in the summer here.  I am sure the local farmers markets disagree as well.  They admit to buying from grocery store wholesalers.  If the local grocery store conglomerates don't buy local  then obviously BB doesn't right?    If you want Wal-Mart or Food City quality produce that is from a land far-faraway then BB will be a good option.  With the proper expectations, you will be satisfied.

I have enjoyed Med Fresh each time I've gone.  Their skewered and grilled chicken seems to be what I order the most.  It is always very moist and tasty.  I've also gotten a combo platter that has a little bit of everything and I haven't been disappointed in anything in that either.  Their salad is simple but good.  The pepper spread on the pita is a nice addition as well.  As many others have said, their garlic sauce is very flavorful and is good with just about everything.    The place is clean and the staff is always friendly and helpful.

I am not a huge coffee drinker, in fact I never drink plain coffee.  But, I have been wanting to go here since reading an article in the New Times a few years ago about the Clover machine, and how this place was one of the few places in the country that had one before Starbucks bought the manufacturer and ended the sale of the machine.   Fast forwards to today:  I finally went to grab a bag for my girlfriend and roommate.  I hate the smell of crappy coffee being made in the morning and how it infects my entire house.  I can tolerate and even enjoy a nice bean.  After 3 or 4 trips in the area at night without the actual address, I came up empty handed because there is no sign on the street and it is hidden behind another building.  Finally I wrote down the address and managed to find it during the day.    First impression:  There is a magnetic field that attracts a disproportionate amount of dirty ass, homeless-looking, transient-type folks.  If I owned the joint I would call in an exterminator and mobile pet groomer.  Spray pesticide on them to kill the fleas, and give them a full-service pet grooming which should include de-matting, shearing, a shampoo, tick collar, nail trim, and an ear cleaning.  My dog held his nose walking by these people.    Maybe they have a must-have-showered-within-the-last-week rule for indoors because the clientele seemed more hygienic.  Minimal decorations, and it is very clear that they are not going to wow you with glitz, glam, christmas cd's or sizes that mean large in 3 different languages.    Unlike many people on here, I actually was helped by a very friendly gentleman (w/ dreds).  He helped me choose a bag, and get me a drink to go.  I went iced latte to go (it was warm out) and got a Guatemalan bag for the coffee drinkers in the house.  My latte was unsweetened and quite tasty.  They have some very primitive-looking coffee brewing techniques and machines which are pretty cool.  All employees had a smile on their face, engaged in some small talk with a few people and promptly made my drink in a few minutes.  I don't know if they canned all the snotty employees or seeing someone that is 6'4" brings out their nicer side.  I can only speak of my experience and it was short and sweet.  I would like to comment on  the most snotty-douche-y review I have ever read.  Note to Phoenicians, if you use the word CenPho, you are exhibiting tool-like behavior.  End of discussion.  If you look down your nose and say that a certain establishment does not belong in said CenPho because it isn't cool enough to be around you, you are moving towards the extreme side of the tool spectrum.  If you have to use profanity in a review you can add the title of tasteless.  My hunch is they saw Mr. Lord of Culture coming from a mile away.  You stay in CenPho and let us folks stay in a city and area without the need for catchy nicknames.  Oh yeah, the word poser died in the 90s, catch up.  Someone as trendy as you should know that.

I have always enjoyed Indian food and it can be tough to get something good in AZ.  There is a lot of average stuff but Guru Palace is excellent.  They have a small floor seating section for those that want to get the full experience.  We did that once but we were so full after I had to roll out of the place.  The wait staff is always friendly and someone always stops by to check on how everything tastes and the spice level.    They have a nice selection of Indian beers.  They come in handy when you order it spicy.  The vegetarian, tandoori and non-vegetarian dinners are a great option if you want variety.   Their tandoori is surprisingly moist and is very tasty.  Lately we have just started trying different things on the menu and haven't been disappointed with anything but I will list a few of my favorites.  The Chili Chicken appetizer is awesome, trust me on that.  It is spicey and sweet (which isn't usually my favorite) but the balance is perfect.  Anything spinach is great for veg dishes as well as the lentils, eggplant, and potatoes.  We (1 male - 1 female)  usually get one appetizer, naan, 2 entrees, rice, and a few beers.  There is always leftovers.  We usually go midweek or on a Sunday but chose to go on Friday.  The place was very busy and there were 3 large parties of what I presume were Indian folks.  That is always a good sign when searching good ethnic food.  It seems the only poor reviews are from buffet goers.  If you go looking for cheap food and lots of it, the leftovers from the day before probably won't be as good as ordering it fresh at night.  Expect that, it is a buffet! But if you are looking for good food and aren't trying to shovel in the most calories try out dinner and you shouldn't be disappointed.  Nobody judges a place based on the buffet.  That is like complaining about the day-old bagels being too hard.

This place blows.  The only reason I have gone is to meet friends.  They happen to know the owner, who is a woman who works there, and eventually one of our friends started working there.  I would never actually order sushi at a place like this, if you do then it is just your fault for the result.  It is not a restaurant, it is a bar folks.  I have snagged a piece of a roll or two off a friends plate and I can say that those little rolls at the grocery store are much better.  I would really like to emphasize that if you are going to a bar for sushi, you get what you deserve.  I never order anything fancy, usually a beer or some gin but damn they are slow as hell getting the order done.  There have never been more than 10 people there (even on a Saturday at midnight), yet they are so slow you would think they were swamped.  Hell, for the group I was with being on speaking terms and official regulars you would think we could get some damn service.  Guess not.    This place has been dead every time I go.  You would think the club next door with a line would give them some overflow.  Parking is a disaster because valet takes everything.  In fact, the last time I tried to valet they told me they were full, but took the car behind me!  Apparently my Honda is not baller enough for them.  I wound up finding a free spot very close anyway, but that area is such a nightmare.  I will never suggest anyone go to Pearl because there really isn't anything positive about the experience.    bad service, bad food, bad parking, Scottsdale pricing = no bueno!

I'm not sure exactly what we had but it was all very tasty.  We got an appetizer and 2 or 3  entrees to share (2 people).  We also got a dessert.  The portions are very small which is what we need and maybe not what we want.  It allows you to get some incredible ingredients without taking a 2nd mortgage.  However, do not be fooled by the $$ cost rating of 11-30 a person.  That is the funniest thing I have ever heard.  We did get a bottle of wine also (great prices on wine) and it was well over $120 for our meal.  The portions are small but not the price.  I am not complaining but I hope some people don't expect a full size meal for the price and get disappointed.    Go in there expecting to try some new and delicious flavors.  You will not have a bad meal.  It isn't snooty and the light-weight wine drinkers can get a little loud.  This place is unique for the area and I would love to have more places like it.  It is nearly impossible to run a quality place like this without having the alcohol sales to carry the business.  I think we all know why fine dining is lacking in the southeast valley.  Hopefully there are enough people to support it.  This place has an incredible (and overwhelming) wine selection.  Don't be shy, say "I want to spend $X and pick me something tasty."   They have one private room for parties, a patio, a bar, booths and tables.  Cork is a very cool place and I strongly recommend giving it a shot.

I may not know Caribbean food, but I know a good meal when I have it.  I am up to 4 great meals from Hot pot and I plan on having more.  I have had curry goat, curry chicken, oxtail and jerk chicken.  I loved them all.  I also really enjoy the lightly cooked cabbage on the side.  Very helpful and friendly staff.  They usually have a limited menu (to keep costs down) but usually have several meats to choose from.  I plan on trying everything on the menu.  This is just another diamond in the rough.  On top of the wonderful food, it is always good to support local.

I love this place.  I originally found it while looking for a local place to buy some dog food.  They didn't stock the Orijen I wanted but I did buy some treats and other goodies.  Eventually, enough of her customers convinced them to stock the food.  The owner will listen to what the customers want and thoroughly researches it prior to bringing in a new product.  The owner is very knowledgeable and can provide you with several options at various price points.  On top of that, you will not find food at a better price, trust me I've tried.

First of all, I incorrectly thought I was going to the other high rated Hawaiian place because I didn't pay attention to the name or address.  I just knew this place replaced Julio too's (dating myself) and checked it out.    Pretty much everything about my meal was poor.  All of the sides are either really bad impersonations of Korean sides, or corn straight out of the Del Monte can.  The seaweed used white vinegar, the cabbage was bland, and the clear noodle things were just not tasty.    I got a combo plate with BBQ chicken and the short ribs.  The short ribs were chewy with very tough fat on them.  They were not that good.  The BBQ chicken was not that good either and resembled slimy dark meat chicken that you find in a Panda Express rice bowl.  I guess the white rice was... white... and made of rice.  At least they didn't screw that part up.  for $10 I expect a much better meal.  I ate about half of it and threw the rest away.  I will never go back, and if you are someone that wants a lot of these flavors, go check out Cho Dang in Chandler.  It seems a lot of Paradise's (horribly ironic name) food is highly influenced by Korean food but poorly done.  You can get a better meal at a sit down place for less money at Cho Dang.     If you want food that rivals Samurai Sam's, Kyoto Bowl, or Panda Express than this is your place.  If you want decent food I suggest looking elsewhere.  I will be checking out the other Hawaiian joint around the corner to see if it is any better.  I am clueless on how this place averages 4 stars.  They deserve 1 star, but I was going to be nice and go with 2.  However, I just remembered that they do not have a public restroom which always chaps my ass.

Restaurant Week Review:  The food was good, and we happened to go on sunday with half off wine but the problem was that the restaurant week offerings were a "tasting menu".  That is not how any other restaurant did it, that is not how the online menu depicted the meals, and small tapas sized dishes do not count as "courses".  For what we got it was hugely over-priced.  $29 for 2 appetizers and a miniature dessert. 50 other restaurants around town managed to make full meals fit into the $29 price point.   If you can't follow the theme of the event, don't participate.    One of the reasons we chose The Mission was that a drink was included.  We assumed it was a glass of wine.  Well, it was actually about 2 ounces of a frozen margarita.  Take away the ice and you have about a teaspoon of tequila.  Thanks!  They should have used a thimble  as the icon for their drink on the Restaurant week list.        I got duck carnitas for "course 1".  It was 3 quarter sized gorditas.  (I am not exaggerating the small size)  It was tasty but if I wanted hors d'oeurvres I would go to a cocktail party.  My gf got a Rock Shrimp Salad which was small but decent too.    For appetizer 2 I got the Pork Shoulder and she got the Grouper.  I got maybe 2 oz of meat and she got maybe 3 ounces of fish.  Both were good, but not satisfying.    For appetizer 3 (dessert edition) we got the churros with a chocolate shake which was 4 pinky sized churros with about 3 sips of a milkshake.  I think I could have stored the entire amount in the straw.  The gf got Pastel de Almendra which I don't remember how it was.  Wasn't great, wasn't bad.    Of the 4 places we tried for Restaurant week, this place came in last.  Food wasn't as good as the others (Avalon, Wildfish, Papas Tapa Frita) and obviously the hobbit portions were not in the spirit of the event.  I'll stick to the other places that sacrificed a little profit margin in order to gain a new customer Vs this place trying to find a way to take as much money as possible while doling out the least amount of food pleasure.

This was my first experience at a local farmers market and I was disappointed to find out very little of it was from AZ.  Isn't that the purpose of a farmer's market?  If you aren't a farmer why are you there selling goods from Asia and South America?  There were 2 booth that specifically advertised locally grown.  I bought some decent items from them.  One of them was selling a bunch of eggs but the cartons were from Hickman's (enormous commercial egg producer) which isn't what I envision at a small market.  Maybe they just bought the cartons from them, who knows.    There was a person selling salsa (locally made) but it was more expensive than Whole Foods where it is also sold.  I have only been once and plan on trying other markets before going back.

Love the interactive, take as many samples as you please, style fro-yo joints.  This one is the best around.  It has the creamiest and least watery fro-yo.  They also rotate flavors often.  The place is packed every time we go and is filled with families, seniors, youngsters, and college students.  With In n Out next door, it is like a food Mecca that people migrate from all over to partake in the goodness.  We're kind of obsessed, tread cautiously.

I work around the corner and have been going here since they have been open.  I have had nearly every sandwich on the menu and every bagel they offer.  They use Boar's Head meat (best of the best) and make their bagels fresh throughout the day.    I am originally from NJ and consider myself a bit of a bagel snob.  I have had no luck around town trying to find a decent bagel.  There is one near my house (back east bagel's) that won New Times best bagel and it is one of the worst I have had.  That shows how weak the bagel gene pool is in this town.  But, NY bagels has a very good bagel and a variety to choose from.    I get a dozen bagels to bring home and freeze to have for bfast on my way in to work.  I am not going to claim they are equal to a NY/NJ bagel, but they are the best I have had in town.   The staff and owners are very friendly as well.  There are very few other locally run places in the area, most are fast food franchises.    I have been going here for quite a while, and will continue to based on the quality of food, their cleanliness, and their friendliness.

Gotta up this to a 4 for a few reasons. I have had a chance to try their burger (several times) and the Italian Beef sandwich.  The burger is awesome, maybe the best in town.  The Italian Beef was very good but a tad salty for me.  The food is always very fresh and delicious. Their chicken sandwich is quite good too.  They lightly flavor everything (only salt and pepper on the burger) so the freshness and natural flavor really shine at Lobby's.  This place gets great reviews for a reason.

I can't stop getting their burgers.  The staff is always great, and everything on the menu is too.  What more can I say that we haven't said yet?  I challenge anyone to find me a better burger.  I need to keep the other menu items in the mix but it is so hard to resist the burger.  Like I've said in my previous reviews, the Italian beef is good, and the dogs are too.

I first found out about FnB while reading the New Times.  I didn't think much of it but then saw the glowing reviews on here and put 2 and 2 together.  Due to the use of local ingredients, and a unique concept we decided to try it out.    We started with a few cocktails and some fried oysters.  The fried oysters were different that some I've had before.  They were super crisy on the outside, but raw and fresh on the inside.  I prefer my oysters still in the shell, but my gf loved them.    For the meal I had a pasta (made in-house) dish with heirloom tomatoes and mozzarella.  The gf had the chicken dish with polenta.  Both were fantastic.  The portions were large too, so we had some to take home.  For desert we had a buttercake which was almost like a big cupcake with vanilla ice cream and fresh peaches.  It too was awesome.  This places rating is for real.  Our server was very knowledgeable and explained the menu to us well.  The food was fresh and delicious.  I love the local vibe to the items and the creativity of the menu.  Everything about this place was great.    The place is fairly small so I recommend a reservation.  After your done you are in the heart of town and are within walking distance of any number of places to grab a drink.

Everything here is delicious.  How do I know?  I always split the dinner for two combo which has an incredible amount of food, and a huge variety of their offerings.  We always take 2 boxes full home in leftover.  Everything in that platter is delicious.  Their meats are incredibly juicy.  Their kibbee (king of like a hush puppy with moist ground beef inside) in incredible.  Their kafta is so moist and flavorful.  The salad has a simple but delicious oil & vinegar dressing with some herbs in it.  The rice has raisins and cashews which is unique too.  The food could easily feed 3, maybe 4.    Very friendly staff, good service and good food are all I need.  This is another one of the very tasty Middle Eastern restaurants in Tempe and it is just as good as the other well known ones in the area.

Short form: ordered our food (15 minutes elapse) we get our iced teas (15 minutes elapse) the tables next to us that had ordered and were seated before we got there get SOME of their food, one sends soup back because it's cold.   (15 minutes elapse) 45 minutes into this disaster, I ask for a refund and we leave   Menu didn't look that appetizing, service was awful, and apparently what they served was poorly executed.  That's enough to keep me from ever going back.  (I should have written a review that takes 45 minutes to read, yet you get nothing from it.... kind of like going to Pomegranate)

Best Gyro in town IMO.  What I feel a great gyro needs:  Lots of meat, don't be stingy... and this place is far from stingy.  Must have a good sauce.  I don't want it watered down and runny, this place has a nice thick and flavorful sauce.  and Finally, the quality of that meat better be good, I don't want it bought presliced and warmed up on a cooktop.   It better be spinning before I get it.  Pita Shack freshly shaves that meat off, piles it high on a pita with some awesome fresh onions and a little side of that awesome sauce.    That's really all I order but have had some bites from the girl friends chicken kabob which are very nice too.  They are generous with fries if you are looking for a quick gyro lunch combo.  Lentil soup and the side salad are other good options too.  Food is always fresh and tasty, service is always good.  There are only 1 or 2 other places where I think the gyro is above average in this town, and this place tops that list.

This place could have been my closer to home version of Hot Pot, but it just doesn't cut it.  Service was slow, the food was alright but wasn't exceptional.  Having non-english speakers working for you is one thing if you hide them in the back but having them bring our food and not knowing what the word "sweet n low" is (brought us sugar) and not knowing how to pronounce the dishes he brought to us is just not the best way to do things.    I had the curry goat which was decent.  It was not fall of the bone tender like I prefer those style of dishes but it had good flavor.  I think the sauteed cabbage was over-cooked and too soggy.  The ice tea we ordered was pre-sweetened which would have been nice to know beforehand.  It also was $2 on the menu but $3 on the bill.    I haven't had any luck with places in this shopping center.  Tom's BBQ is an insult to people with taste buds, and SomeBurro is average at best.  Maybe I'll give the place another shot but not before I try some new places and I get tired of driving over to Hot Pot.

I've been interested in trying this place for a while but the pricey reputation kept me away.  Finally I gave it a try.  What you get for $11.  A drink, a 5oz burger, and a fries.  Worth it?  Of course not.  Burger is okay, not great but not bad.  In n Out level?  No.  As good as Lobby's up the street?  Hell no.  The 5oz burger for $6 is almost insulting.  The bun is much too large for the amount of meat, the burger almost gets lost in there.  It is called a burger, please make it the main ingredient.  I got the Arizona burger and everything on it was good, but due to the small burger it kind of overwhelmed it.      I got the Smash fries which have rosemary and olive oil.  They were not good at all.  Very very greasy.  Not sure why you add oil back on to something that was just fried in oil.  Maybe the regular fries aren't as oily.  This is in the same category as Habit Burger.  Worth trying once, completely overpriced, very confused at how they grew beyond one location.    The friendly staff is the best part of the place but I can spend $5 at In n out for better fries, and a better burger all while sitting in my car.  Why pay double for something not as good?  Exactly.

Restaurant Week Review:  We didn't even know restaurant week was going on but our server filled us in on the options.  We could pick one tapas, one entree, one dessert and a glass of wine/sangria for $29.  The entire menu was fair game.    For the tapas we got a pepper stuffed with crab.  It had a nice cream sauce lightly drizzled on it and the whole thing went together well.  The other one was a lamb skewer and it was nicely tender and quite good.  For the entree I got the Valenciana paella.  It had a nice array of seafood and spanish sausage.  I didn't realize how vibrantly yellow it was until I saw it at home.  This easily serves 2 people.  The gf got Meriscada which was clams/shrimp/scallops in a light wine broth.  Hers was very good and more suited for 1 person.    For dessert we got the Creme Brulee.  It was much wider and the dish was shallower then I am used to seeing.  It didn't have a very thick hard crust like you traditionally see on this dessert.  Either way it was very good.  For my dessert I got the Escoces which was Scotch, warm coffee and vanilla ice cream.  This was phenomenal.  They should serve this by the pitcher.    We also shared a bottle of wine (on top of the included glass per person).  The atmosphere was to take your time, enjoy your meal, and in between dishes listen to the live music and watch the dancing.  We enjoyed the entire experience.

Not sure where Stan is from but where I'm from, a Deli is not a restaurant.... it is a deli.    Minus 1 star for deceiving me into expecting a legit Deli to appear on Mill.  minus 1 Star for not understanding what no cheese and no mayo means.  There are many places we have from where I'm from that has the gimmick of 3 pieces of bread.  They are called diners, not delis.    With only 3 other tables needing service I also expected a more attentive server that saw my tea was empty or notice that we needed more napkins because mayo and cheese occupied the original ones.   Even the thank you from the owner/manager was delayed, we were 100ft down the street when he hollered at us.  Hopefully they get it together, I do like independent spots on Mill, but I'm not so sure about a non-Deli Deli being the answer.

Not fresh and not that good.  I would rate it below RA if that gives you a frame of reference.  The fish was slimy, and much chewier than a quality piece of fresh fish should be, especially the salmon.    We started with just a few things and I decided to leave and just snack on something at home because it just wasn't that enjoyable. If you go to sushi joints for sake bombers maybe this will be a good option but if fish is the main concern I would stear clear.    I won't be going back.  If I must have sushi on Mill I'll go to RA (isn't that an awful thing to say?)

Friendly staff, delicious sandwiches and a cool/unique decor.  I wish I had such awesome food at my apartment complex when I was going to ASU, especially late night.  We were stuck with Hungry Howie's, and the kids these days get Brosenbrus?  They have it so good.  Their ciabatta bread is very fresh and soft, unlike the hard bread it is elsewhere.  The innards of the sandwich stay in rather than squirting out which is always good.  They also have good iced tea.  I'll try and hit up this place as much as I can when school is out, I imagine they are very busy when the apartment building is packed.

Disclaimer: This rating is exclusively based on a very brief experience at Hot Pot, none of it food related.    We walked in around 8ish on Saturday night and saw 3 open tables (two 4 top, and an 8 top which was 2 tables slid together).  But, there was a couple sitting down waiting for something.  A server came over, asked if we wanted a table.  She must read minds, we said yes.  She looked around, saw the 16 open seats and said... "want to wait 20 minutes?".  I was completely caught off guard with that line of questioning.  This place maybe had 20-25 people eating, that is 30-40% of the place was open yet there is a 20 minute wait.  The obvious answer was no.  There was no markings on any of the tables signifying reserved, and she didn't claim that they were.  1 of the 4 tops needed to be bussed but there wasn't any rush for them to get that done, and we weren't offered to wait a few minutes to get that table ready.    I wanted to try this place after reading about it in New Times but there is something about atrocious service/communication that sours me on places.  That and apparently we would need the place to be at less than half capacity to get seated.

Tsom deserves two 5 star ratings.  To begin with, I am a carnivore but love to get flavorful vegetarian dishes.  I do not strive for fake meat that consists of overly processed parts that used to be vegetables (I'm looking at you Green).  If you hold your vegetarian fare to a high standard that consists of using spices to make delicious meals than this is a great spot to grab a bite.    Most of the offerings are pitas filled with deliciousness.  The Falafal pita is great, come with a large portion and are very filling.  They have tons of condiments you can add onto them like hit pepper, pickles, other pickled stuff and several sauces like tahini and hot sauce.  They also have a very nice looking "salad bar" which actually consists of pasta, vegetable dishes and tons of other tasty looking things.  I always intend on trying it but I typically go back to the 'ol trusty falafal.  They have several other nice pita sandwiches like portobello and pepper.    Their in house tea is great.  It's the same as they use at the Blue Nile.  It is a black tea with "chai" spices.    (Disclaimer:  This is a seasonal offering, may not be available all the time.  )The second 5 star rating is that they partnered up with a local farm to offer organic vegetable baskets.  The amount you get is incredible.  Just one item was a plastic grocery bag completely filled with spinach.  I used the bigger leaves for sauteing and used the small ones for a salad mix.  Everything in there was fresh, delicious and worth every cent.  I have gone here many times and will continue to get their food, and get the produce baskets.

I live around the corner and figured I'd give the place a try.  Since it is a cafe I assumed they would have a variety of tasty sandwiches to choose from.  Boy was I wrong.  They literally have 4 sandwiches to chose from and they are nearly identical.  3 pieces of bread, mayo, and egg are on everything.   They apparently think their clientele is made up of grade school children because they cut the crust off of the bread.    The sandwiches are pre-made, they just pulled it out of the fridge and gave me half.  Good luck saying "no mayo".  Who sells a sandwich by the half?  It had 3 pieces of bread, a smearing of mayo with pimiento on one side, and a razor thin piece of cheese or ham in the other.  When I saw how lame the sandwich was I asked for an Empenada too but they told me 10 minutes to heat it up.  I wasn't waiting for that, I was hungry.  The sandwich was average and even though he gave me a card to get a free sandwich, I will not be going back.  They sell smoothies if you are into that.  But, they have the name "cafe" in the title so that is how they will be judged.  Poor excuse for a sandwich, plus no variety, plus no substance, plus no selection equals a disaster of a place.    Drink options are bottled soda or bottled water.  After eating the 3 bite sandwich (it literally could have been smashed into 1 bite) in the car before pulling out of the parking lot I immediately wondered where I was going to get lunch.  That is a bad sign.    There are way to many good places with variety, value, and freshness in the area to waste your time trying this place out.

I was looking forward for a good BBQ joint to set up shop in Tempe again since Big City BBQ got big time, moved out of their modest spot at Baseline and Rural and moved to Mesa.  Unfortunately, I just didn't feel the love for this place.  I went for lunch and got the lunch special which was a pulled pork sandwich with a small portion of baked beans and a drink (can of soda) for $10.  There are no other drink options besides a few sodas.  That is a quite steep for an average BBQ sandwich.  The meat was juicy, but not super flavorful.  The BBQ sauce they have is decent and helped flavor it up a bit.    The sandwich was large and I left full but with so much great food in Tempe and a few other good BBQ joints around town I probably won't stumble into this place again.    2 stars is appropriate... meh.

I have enjoyed a Caribbean dog or two while out and about in Scottsdale.  I highly recommend it regardless of whether you are drinking or not.  It is legitimately just a tasty snack and one no one else is offering.  Has always been great for conversation too.   Glad to see others are leaving reviews to get a bit more exposure.    Tip: forget what you want, have him make it his way.  That is what you need.

What is it with Arizona and their obsession with California chains?  It's like every mediocre thing they have in CA, it must be imported here to please the transplants and the AZ residents that have CA envy.  Unfortunately for The Habit Burger Grill, this is more like the mediocre CPK than it is the fantastic In n Out.    The burger's are 1/4lb so to get 1 patty for $4 (without fries and a drink) is outrageous, especially when I can get a double double meal for around $5-6.  I went with the double with fries and a drink and it was over $8.  Burger was average, fries mediocre.  For people that eat in they even use the same burger diapers In n Out uses.    I don't know what was up with the place, they literally had 10-15 employees working when I was there.  There were 6 of us dining in.  Maybe that's why it is so pricey, they have too many people to pay.  This place may appease the LA transplants that feel everything is better from back home but I don't see too many people deciding to spend $3 more for inferior food than a drive thru like In n Out.    The only thing "habit" about this place is that I'm going to make a habit of not going back.  I also didn't understand why they felt the need to give out the vibrating thing as I waited for my order.  I wasn't waiting for a table, I was waiting for a bag of food.    Hit up Lobby's a mile or so north for a big, juicy, flavorful burger  that is locally owned and blows away this less than stellar chain from CA.  The most disappointing thing is the landlord kicked out TOTTs for a run of the mill burger chain.

Found this place on here about 6 mo ago and have gone twice, really enjoyed it both times.  Service has been very good both times, drinks stayed full (it is semi-self serve, so ymmv), and food came out piping hot.    The food:  The girlfriend and I like to get samplers so we can try a wide range of food, both times we got 1 non-veg, and 1 veg combo.  I highly recommend that to a) people looking for variety and b) people looking for leftovers.    The first time we went we saw these incredible looking fries come out so it was a must order the 2nd time through.  The Tikka Misala fries were very good.  I feel like the menu said feta but we got blue cheese.  It was still very delicious.  The only thing I would enjoy more would be more naan to come with it,  I know I could order more but I am too busy enjoying the deliciousness.    Have been looking for a reliable option for this kind of food nearby and I think I've found it.  Can't wait to try more of the menu.

Their sandwiches really pack on the meat, use a very fresh and soft bread, and are quite tasty.  They don't sell a footlong with 3 strips of deli meat.  Their sandwich is about 8" with a good half pound of meat on it, maybe more.  I've been here a few times and their sandwiches have always been good.  The staff is also quite friendly.  The menu items include tax which is refreshing.  The only negative I have is that they don't offer a lower calorie side with the sandwich.  It is mararoni salad (mayo) or potato salad (mayo) or regular chips.  I wish they had some baked chips or a pasta salad with a simple oil & vinegar thing to be a little lighter.    With that being said, it doesn't stop me from going back.  It is certainly better and cheaper than Sacks down the street and they fit more meat than Dilly's puts on their sandwich which has about 4 times the amount of bread.

Portions were a bit small, tad pricey, taste was fine.  Not the most juicy but that could be from sitting around a while.  There are some other BBQ joints in town closer to me, so I'll stick to those.

I'm going to write this place off as just one of those things in which Mesa patrons are just not capable of giving accurate info when it comes to sushi.   Our experience?  Pretty terrible.  I have a few standbys I get everywhere to compare.  One is a spider roll.  DO you freshly fry the crab or are you lazy?  This place was lazy.  Not warm at all.  "Look at all that cool different stuff on the ad on the table, do you have that stuff?" server: "No".  wth is the point of having some goofy food distributor ad with options that you don't have?  We wound up ordering much less than normal just to get out while we could so it was more like half of a meal.    We got a few other things that were all underwhelming leading me to lump it up with 90% of sushi places in town.... they fall into the DO NOT RETURN category.  I have a feeling an east valley native 4 star at a sushi place is equal to a 1.5-2 star review for people not from land locked states.  Minus points for no sushi bar too.  Now to the best part.  A fella with a heavy country accent, Wranglers and a cowboy hat rolled in with another fella.  This was his time to show off and puff his chest out with how worldly he was.  "I want you to fry me some of that salmon and then put some of that sauce on it... yeah.. the panko stuff... yeah with that aoli stuff too".  Did I just hear that correctly?  Take sashimi grade salmon and fry it?  Maybe that is the target audience...  This is an average run of the mill place.  Not good, not awful.  The disappointing part was the buildup with the rave reviews.  Went expecting exceptional, not underwhelming.  Part of me thinks people are reviewing sushi for best prices, not best quality or flavor.  If you like RA, this place will be fine.  If you struggle finding good sushi, keep looking.

This place is so overpriced it is amazing that they have any customers.   You can go to any mom & pop pet store or bigger chain store and find anything that is here... but for about 30% less.  For the same food I buy about a mile or two away at Sunflower Pet Supply,   Choice charged an extra $15-20 more.  Not even pretending to be competitive.    Yes they have a good selection but when it comes to price, this is the worst pet store in town.

Cliff Note's version:  - Soggy fries - paper thin patty - overpriced - free peanuts (who really cares about this?) - average flavor - soggy fries - cool soda machine - short line because everyone already discovered this place is meh.  A burger fries and drink are what, $10-12?  BUt I can go to In n Out and get superior fries, a superior burger, all while watching them smash potatoes while I wait in the drive thru all for $6?!?!?!  Please explain to me why this place exists again.      This is what you get with massive corporate food chains.  I expected nothing less.  I've tried it twice, won't even go back.  I encourage everyone to go here though, I don't need a longer line at places I enjoy! ;)

If I rated this after the first time I went, it would have been 3 or 4 stars.  But that was several years ago and it was probably different ownership.  The most recent experience was highly underwhelming.  When we ordered, the person told us they were out of egg whites.  Unless they are 100% out of eggs, that makes zero sense.  I'm guessing the cook mentioned that and our original order was placed.  Minus 1 star for not knowing where egg whites come from.  The hash browns were just chopped up potatoes that were steamed on a cooktop.  Not a spec of seasoning.  Just bland.  Minux 1 star for not seasoning the food  The price is also quite high for essentially a divey breakfast joint.  I can go to Ncounter and spend the same for much better food.  Just not worth giving another shot until maybe a new group takes it over.  It is breakfast, the cheapest ingredients out there.  $8 for a breakfast burrito that isn't good?  Minus 1 star.  There are many tasty places on Mill, Just keep walking past this one and you'll be fine.

Fantastic place for a buyer, regardless of experience level.  I'm not "new" per se to firearms, have had a few hands guns and a shotgun for about a decade but I would not consider myself an expert by any means.  I like to thoroughly research and ask a ton of questions.  I live down the street from Healy Arms, and have passed it as I visit the pool store in the same area.  I finally went in for a CZ, which happened to be out of stock due to the holiday buying.  The gentleman helping me never once tried steering me to a gun in stock, and took the time to show me similar guns with similar features so I could compare.  At the time I was window shopping.  What I wanted was in stock online, and few a few less dollars.  but they earned my business, so I went back and asked for them to contact me when it was back in stock.  Within 30 minutes, the owner had located what I wanted, and it was in stock and in my possession within 4-5 days.  The entire process was a breeze.    DO NOT take customer service for granted, especially in this business.  A lot of people think because they like guns, and know guns, they can run a business selling them but don't have the personality to pull it off.  Look at the dreadful reviews for some others in the area.   If you want to feel welcomed into the hobby/sport/etc, this is the place to go whether you want to hit some clays, go plinking, or looking for something for defense.  Give them a chance to earn your business.    Have also picked up some accessories here like magazines, ear protection, etc.

My girlfriend heard of this place so we gave it a shot.  Lots of fresh ingredients and everything we had tasted very good.  I give the place 3 stars, but gave an extra bump for being dog friendly and giving out dog biscuits.    The only part that could use improving would be to put something in the side salad outside of lettuce and dressing.  Mix in some other veggies for variety.  We've been 2 or 3 times and the sandwich I've had has always been good.  She has enjoyed the salads each time as well.    We didn't have any of the blended drinks but that seems to be a very popular item.  If that is your thing, definitely give them a try here.  Service is always very good and the outdoor seating is great for the pups and the people watching.  Should be tried by anyone looking for a salad/sandwich cruising around old town.

Finally remembered to try this place, and I should have done it sooner.  Staff:  Insanely friendly and helpful  Selection: Pretty much have everything.  Tons of options for the gluten-free, vegetarian, or us carnivores.  I enjoy the vegetarian options as a change up and this place has variety to fit a wide array of tastes.  Food:  I was a bit overwhelmed by the options so there was no method to my madness.  It really was delicious and the portions were huge.  I went with the Gyro, some kale veggie, the basil hummus, rice, etc, etc.... too much to list.  I went with the bowl while my gf went with the salad.    This place blew us away in all aspects.  Definitely plan on going back.  Only mini critique is to stay open later for us dinner procrastinators!

Decided to have Chinese for the first time in a few years, and I wasn't looking for a big chain or delivery.  I found this place on here and was glad I did.  Appearance:  It is on Apache east of the 101... enough said.  May have a Tempe address but that place is in Mesa if you ask me.  Menu: massive menu, a bit overwhelming.  Did have the server help with some suggestions to help us decide.  Cutting that in half would still yield a ton of tasty options.  Food:  We ordered potstickers, hot and sour soup, and shrimp w/ oyster mushrooms.  The potstickers were great, love the fresh green onion in them.  The mushroom and shrimp was very nice.  Very light but fresh and flavorful.  Hope you like ginger! (we do).    The star for me is the hot and sour soup.  I always loved it back in NJ but out here it has always been very different.  Many places sub in regular mushrooms rather than use the fungus, and many add pork.  NOT HERE.  The soup was like I remember back east.  A slight gelatinous mouth feel, bamboo shoots, small strips of tofu, and that delicious fungi.  They knocked it out of the park.  It was the girlfriend and I and the small would have fed us both.    When it comes to ethnic food I allow a lot of leeway when it comes to the decor.  If you don't, steer clear.  But if you are just looking for Chinese food that isn't a chain, or isn't your typical delivery joint this will be a great option for you.    Suggestion:  Look through all the incredible pictures people put up.  I already have my next meal planned! (pork belly, water boiled fish, spicy cucumber)  We even had a bit of entertainment as we left, I think it was the first time one of the guys there was riding a bicycle and he semi-crashed/drove into the restaurant.  He could have wheelied by me and I wouldn't have cared, I was too busy working on that soup.

I will say I got a decent price on what I went there for.  It was a local vendor, very small time and was hassle free.  Got a great price.  But it was literally buy from them or leave empty handed as the pricing for most items are easily beaten online, that is without factoring in the  the $40 I paid for two of us to park and enter.  Some people were actually selling for $100-150 more than you can easily find online for some new stuff.  Roll your eyes, move on.     I wish certain gun people realized one party or one ideology does not have a monopoly on the hobby.  Not everyone possesses them for the same reasons.  Being an election year, the political groups were in full force.  The non "gun show" stuff is quite annoying.  The people watching is fantastic, as is any event in this dumpy part of town, just magnified with the gun show experience.  But overall, I don't get why we pay so much to get in.  Why not charge vendors more?  Maybe they got tired of the window shopping, and only want shoppers in there, who knows.    There are some quality vendors, with helpful employees.  so it isn't all bad, and there is an incredible variety, great place to look for ideas of something you maybe never got to handle, or considered purchasing.  There are deals to be had.  Do your research online, and at your local stores, if you see a deal, go for it.  If not, eat the $40 entrance fee and bail.

Stumbled across this place when eating lunch at the Farm.   This place is in rough shape.  Completely neglected at this point.  Mass amounts of frost sensitive items outside being frosted and dying.  If this was a personal collection then a new hobby has taken over.  Should have a fire sale and get it in the hands of some people that will nurse it back to health.  If you want some cool African plants Arizona Cactus Sales is the place to go.  Plenty of stuff in stock and for sale.

(Update since other review was for previous location and did not move over to here)  My original review was 5 star from '09, and is still 5 star in '15, mostly because they have not added a 6th star yet.  Always great products, great prices, and great conversation.  Top notch items whether it be dog beds, toys, food, treats, or supplements.

Have eaten here once and gotten takeout half a dozen times.  Food is always fantastic.  Service was solid too.  One thing missing from my local spots was some decent pasta and this place hits the spot.  Very friendly GM/owner that makes sure you are taken care of.  Genuinely looking for that feedback, which is the key to the places that stick around.  I hope it does.  Definitely worth a try.  Some of what we have had most recently are the Mac N Cheese, Chicken Marsala and a few soups.  All very tasty and quite rich.  You will fill up fast and have some tasty leftovers.  As a bonus they had some nice cocktails and a solid beer selection.    While we left before they performed there were some people setting up for music, so there is that if you are into a little live music while dining.  This has inserted itself into heavy rotation.

Called ahead to confirm something was in stock, fought through rush hour traffic to get there and it was worth it.  Very friendly guy helped me from start to finish.  it was an easy sale because I knew what I wanted.  Reason it isn't a 5 is because they had me pay BEFORE doing the paperwork.  No reason to do that.  I knew there were no issues, but it may be for some.  and I saw a sign that said a $25 fee is charged if the background check fails which seemed odd.  Also, I'm just not a fan of the cash vs credit pricing.  I know it is popular in this industry but I avoid gas stations that do it, it is just the nature of the beast in this industry I guess.  I did pay cash to save a few bucks.  It is a tough drive for me from Tempe, but if I find something on their site and its in stock, I would not hesitate to do business with them again.

Nice clean shop, lots of guns.  Not as much variety as you might expect.  Got a hello from someone behind the register, and we browsed.  Was in the market for an AK. after doing a full lap, told the gentleman what I was looking for, and we walked over to check a few out.  Was going fine up until this point.  Just didn't seem eager to talk much, was just short with us. Gave off the vibe that we were being either an inconvenience, or should already known what we were talking about.  Irony being the person was misinformed on the item being discussed.  I decided to stop there.  Was about to ask to see their safes, and also take a look at a different item with a different employee.  Just decided it wasn't worth the effort and bailed.  Too many other places that will be a bit more eager for business.  Prices are average.  Customer Service is an issue in this business at times, based on previous experience of other reviewers it can be an issue here.  We might have had a better experience with the female employee, when we were still browsing, she was approachable and friendly.

1st time going we had tacos, and tried a bunch of different meats, the standout of them all is the smoked chicken.  WOW!  this is next level stuff.  not your standard low grade chicken cooked on a flat top like your typical late night joints.  this is packed with that smokey flavor.  I smoke all kinds of stuff at home and they save me the work.  Great spot for lunch on my day off.  I'll get the smoken chicken in a burrito and it is fantastic.  I need to sample some other options but then I don't get my chicken fix.  The chicken reminds me of BackYard Taco in Mesa.  Much closer for me, and that great smoked flavor hits the spot.

Lots of good Pita joints in town, this fits into that group.  Nice quality meat, and the tzatziki sauce was good.  I'd definitely stop in for a Gyro if in the area again.

Decided to try this new place out, and find out we have been to one of their previous establishments a few years back.  Same great food.  This time it seems like the Sons are running the show, so you get some great customer service and conversation, not always what you say about Indian Dining.    Had a bunch of stuff, took home some leftovers.  We had a goat dish (off menu) and some of the cauliflower (forgot the name of the vegetarian dish) and some tandoori chicken.  Chicken was very juicy, everything was great.    Will absolutely go back.  We were the last one there and were not rushed.  We don't like keeping people so we made it quick :)  Very clean and modern.  If anything like their other place the lunch buffet will be fantastic.

Very creative with the menu, high quality dogs/sausages are the base, and you could make any kind of dog you want, lots of great homemade sides like the potato salad.  Boy are they filling too.  Good beers on tap.  Nice guys work/own the place.
