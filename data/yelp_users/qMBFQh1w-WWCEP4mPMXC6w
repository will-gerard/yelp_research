I really like Touch of Thai. My eating out adventures usually stem from my good friend Kevin, who is a vegetarian, and though very nice, I wouldn't want to serve him in a restaurant, just very picky....   Kevin loves this place, always suggesting that we go there, the other day I happily agreed, as it is not even very far from my house.  The service is always great, very nice people run this place. Become a regular (like my friend Kevin) and the service and food is even better.   This time we had the Tohm Khah soup with tofu, it had always been one of my favorites as i think it blends spice and coconut milk together so very nicely. make sure to order some steamed rice to come along with the soup as it is perfect to soak up all the goodness.   We also had the Panang Curry with tofu, and it has carrots and green beans in it too, med spice on this one today was pretty warm, but not to the point where we couldn't enjoy our meal.   As for the price, a great deal. Lunch combos for only 5.95, and our soup was 8.95 and was enough for both of us to enjoy we didn't even finish it all and took it home for later.   For some reason even tho the decor is kinda...well.....i don't know the right word for it.... but anyway for some reason this place just makes me only want to eat out at local business you know, make sure my income goes back into the local community?   I only have one suggestion, maybe some patio seating?, maybe just even two tables outside, the biker bar two or three businesses down the strip mall, doesn't bother or "scare" me at all. Its just nice to be outside sometimes.  oh one last tip if you've never been here...  Mon thru Fri they close for a break @ 2:30pm and then reopen for dinner @ 5pm . But sat and sunday they are open from noon till ten I think.

horrible service, I live near this place and have prob been at least 10 times, and not once have i EVER gotten speedy service. The girls have never been rude to me, but Ive never seen a sense of urgency from them.  Foods ok, decent enough for me to return :)  Honestly the service is so bad on the inside that I will usually opt for the wait in the drive thru, saves me from tipping for less than stellar service.

I've been to this restaurant more than a few times and am rarely disappointed.   On most occasions I sit at the bar with one or two friends. They have a great atmosphere, decent happy hour, and well trained bartenders. I have never had a "slow service' problem eating here, but then again I rarely sit at the tables.   It gets busy pretty much EVERYDAY not just on weekends so if you are going with a big group or even just a few people and are gonna want a table, I would recommend calling ahead.   I would have to say their best deal is when their oysters are on sale for something like 4 buck a dozen. They aren't the most premium oysters (out of season) but still pretty good, especially when they are at a bargain price. Try their blue cheese chopped salad its great, they have some kind of special blue cheese dressing that is something to brag about.

My new favorite pizza: The Godfather, seriously pizza is my all time favorite food and after my boyfriend started working near Yo Pauly's, it has become mandatory for him to bring it home once a week.  nice ppl, clean place. Its more expensive than your local Pizza Hut or Dominos but WAY worth it.

I first became a fan of Humble Pie when a friend of mine would come over on a weekly basis and bring take out from the Humble Pie on Tatum, yes Humble Pie's pizza to go is what originally got me hooked. I think that goes pretty far considering all the toppings that can easily perish on a hot pizza during a car ride. But it was and always had been great!  Last week I finally got the chance to actually go into a Humble Pie, this time Scottsdale one, and was once again very pleased with the results.  A friend and I went on a Thursday evening I think around 730/ 8 pm or so and it was a little busy, but we didn't have to wait at all for a table.  I really liked the atmosphere there, low lit, patio seating and even seating where you can watch the guys make your pizza, (how fun!) M y only gripe on seating was that I did feel a little close to the table beside us, as far as conversations and things, but for those that don't really mind "family style" seating (although thats not quite what they got going on, the tables are still really close) wont mind it at all.  Beer on tap? Check. And some really good ones. There is nothing a enjoy more than being able to enjoy a local (AZ) brew. The wine list looked good as well.  some may think... gourmet pizza? Well fear not if you have a picky or 'I like the simple things in life" type eater, they can make some really really great pepperoni pizza as well. As for me, I prefer the prosciutto, pear and Gorgonzola cheese pizza with arugula. Wow. i always want to try one of their other creations, but usually end up with that one. I cant imagine ANY of their pizzas not being pretty darn good.  Service was good. The servers looked like they liked their job and were friendly.  Word on the street was that Humble Pie has been trying to portray themselves as an "adult" pizzeria. And I could see that and I personally like the idea. There were children in there at the time I was and of course Humble Pie is very accommodating to them and all families, I just think they like more of the adult scene.  So to sum things up, I really like Humble Pie, it was a nice meal, not too pricey, great to take a date, but I'm curious to check out the one on Tatum to see how the vibe there is.

2.5 stars   I really dont have much to say about this place that others havent already.   I do however know that one day when I went I saw about 5 ppl literally pass out while in line and have to get medical assistance. WTF? no mysters in huge lines? Sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen when someone collapses and could possibly die...   I have never really been one to stand in lines anyway but I did get a season pass none the less, I kinda enjoy the lazy river, although it has no aesthetic value what so ever, but I'm sure in a few yrs the foliage will have grown and it will be a bit nicer.   i do think the kids area is nice, all the kids seem to enjoy it.  I wish they stayed open later, maybe served beer or something for adults?  Oh and really every time i go, its a high school flashback, there are young high school couple groping eachother at every turn, some really going to far for a public place if you ask me, esp. with little kids around too or high school kids talking about who they are gonna fight next or thier next party... but then again it is summer so its almost to be expected.  I just still cant believe they dont have mysters... it really blows my mind, so if anyone does have a real good reason why, please tell me so I can stop hating on them for it.
