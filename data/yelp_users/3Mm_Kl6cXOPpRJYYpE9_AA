Fantasia Crystals is hands down the best in town!  They have a wide variety of crystals/gems and jewelry, all of which fairly priced.  This is my go-to store when I am looking for a specialty stone or need a large quantity of stones for grids and gifting.  It is also the only place we were able to find amber teething necklaces for my nephew.  They also have a variety of other items, which I haven't explored much yet, and offer a lot of educational classes for free or affordable fees.  I have noticed a lot of different employees but every one of them have been very friendly and helpful.

I've been taking my daughter to AZ Vision since 2007.  Overall we have been very happy with the doctors, sales people, and other staff.  They are always very friendly and helpful.  The only complaint I have is the wait time;  I am always there for 2.5-3 hours!!  Thankfully it's only once a year.

I've been a Michael's customer for many years, and have always prefer Michael's over Joanns.  I like Michaels because they have a great selection, offer many crafts for children, have their $1 items, great sales, and I can always find what I need there.  However, I only give Michael's 4 stars because their customer service is disappointing.  In all of my visits, and I shop there at least 1-2 times per month, I have never been greeted, smiled at, asked if I needed help, asked if I found everything okay, or thanked.  On the rare occassion that I need assistance, the employees act bothered by my asking for their help.  They always seem to be very unhappy and robotic.  Joanns is no better, so I have to wonder if crafty people who work at craft stores are just cranky, boring people.  5 stars for Michaels if they work and improve their customer service!

In a hurry for last minute balloons for a family member who is celebrating their 19th birthday in the hospital, we stopped at Party City.  We were helped by a young name, Michael.  He worked quickly for us, blowing up 14 balloons.  During the 15 minutes he helped us, he chatted with us, gave us some tips,  and directions to a deli place.  We were blown away, no pun intended, by his high level of customer service, friendliness, helpfulness and wanted to make sure his manager recognizes what a great employee he/she has there!!  Thank you Michael for assisting us with the Batman balloon bouquets!

Love, love, love this store!  We've been going to this store for many years, and you can find unique gifts for just about anyone, and for a great price.  If you're into healing gems, they have such an awesome selection of go-to stones and good stones for beginners.  I love their prices.  One of my favorite items are their Himalayan salt lamps for $15 - $35.  I have several throughout my home and only buy them from here.  Customer service is always on point and their staff is knowledgeable and helpful when it comes to energy healing.  On our last visit (my sister-in-law and myself) we were helped by an amazing young man, Nelson, who helped us in finding specific stones and even introducing new stones.  Loved his ENERGY!!

Busy Sunday brunch, went with another family after church.  Overall everything was good.  Server was on the chip, salsa, and drink refill!!!  Wait time was a little long but it was Sunday brunch so no complaints there.  Minus one star because food was "okay" but not 5 star worthy.  It wasn't hot and kind of dry/hard.  I ordered the pollo con queso which I've had before and it was better.

The husband and myself went to outback for Valentines Day, no reservations, and a very long wait.  To be expected, right?  Ended up grabbing a table at the bar, they quickly cleaned it off, and we were helped right away.  We had one of the best servers, by far, that we've ever experienced.  He was on it with the drinks, lots of personality, funny, and professional.  Food was delish, of course, but the only slight negative was the cheesecake.  It tasted cheesy and not very sweet.  The service was so good though we didn't complain.  Otherwise 5 stars to sure!!

Never had a bad experience.  Wait,I take that back.  I once waited in a long line just for lemonade and they were out.  The lady was so sweet and felt so bad, she gave me a bunch of coupons to come back and get free lemonade.  THATS COSTUMER SERVICE!  Every experience has been pleasant, service is quick, and food is hot.  No complaints, except that they're closed Sunday's, but I don't blame them.

Is it possible to have a bad experience at Chick-Fil-A?  It's like the Disneyland of fast food chains!  Always spotless, super clean, and inviting.  The staff is always friendly, smiling, and displaying top notch old fashion customer service.  I love that they always say "my pleasure" like we're back in the 1950's.  Food is ordered accurately, delivered quickly, and always hot.  I like that they will come around and refill your drink, something other fast food places do not do.  Sets them apart.  It also speaks highly that their management team is also in the mix, working hard, and setting the example for their employees.  It shows good leadership.  Keep doing what you're doing Chick-Fil-A!!!

I work in the area and wanted to buy my staff some breakfast.  I don't go to Mc Donalds often, as I am not a huge fan of their food, but it was the closest fast food establishment to my work - so Mc Donalds it is!  I ordered 2 Big Breakfasts with Hot Cakes on one order and another Big Breakfast with Hot Cakes on a separate order (two different payments).  I pulled up to the window and was told to pull around the parking space #1.  I told the cashier, "Ok.  Just remember I have two SEPARATE orders."  She looked at me confused, smirked, and said she didn't understand with a giggle A.K.A. she didn't know English.  I smiled and trusted they would know what to do and pulled around.  A few minutes later (I did not have to wait very long) another lady came up to my window with one of my orders.  I explained to her that I had two separate orders.  She told me, she didn't speak English.  At this point I am now becoming annoyed.  So I get out of the car, lock it up, and walk into the restaurant.  I go up to the cashier (third person at this point) and started to explain that I had two separate orders.  She looked at me confused and then called her manager over, as she did not speak English either.  The young girl, the supervisor on duty, asked me what the problem was.  So I explained to her that I have two separate orders and I am missing one of my orders.  She then tells me that I only paid for 2 orders.  I told her NO that I have two separate orders and I paid for both of them separately (and have the receipts for each of them).  She looks annoyed, walks back over to the window, where my order was sitting, grabs it, and hands it to me pissed off... as thought it was somehow MY fault?  No apologies offered.  Only COLD food.  At that point, I walk out without saying a word.  Annoyed.  Pissed.  But I just wanted to go back to work.  I only ended up eating a hashbrown, the sausage, and that's it.  The eggs were set, slimy, and COLD.  The pancakes were COLD.  The biscuit was hard.  I basically threw money in the toilet.    I did leave a review with Mc Donalds (as instructed on their receipts) but I fulled expect no response, as we all know Mc Donalds does not care much about their customers.  That is why I stopped going a long time ago.  They could learn from places like In and Out and Chick-Fil-A which truly value their customers feedback and train their employees how to treat customers.

Olive Garden is Olive Garden.  It's a chain food restaurant.  I love Olive Garden although not the best Italian food out there.  It's a good time for a family, affordable, and still delish!  I work in the area and on occassion my boss and myself like to order take out.  We love the convienence of ordering online, picking up at our designated pick up time, and having an affordable lunch that isn't "fast food".    Unfortunately, I am honestly not sure if I will order take out from this specific location again.  I always give someone or a business one pass.  People have bad days.  Businesses have bad days.  No one is perfect.  Nonetheless, I had two very similar experiences approx. a month apart and now I am concerned about having another experience.  So as of right now, I have been opting out of ordering Olive Garden to go from this location.  One reason we like the online ordering is because we're designated one hour for lunch.  I save time by ordering online and picking up at our designated pick up time.  Who doesn't want to savor every minute of their lunch hour?  The last two times, without fail, our order has not been ready at the designated pick up time.  I'm not talking about running a few minutes late either.  I show up a few minutes late and still wait an additional 10-15 minutes.  The server, who we happened to get both times, seems very scattered.  I feel for her - I know it's has to be a hard job.  So I patiently wait although I am annoyed.  The she rings us up, charging the wrong cards, backing out the charges, forgetting to put our coupon codes back on so therefore overcharges us, and by time this is all said and done - I am done.  I don't say anything and just leave, only to discover the alfredo sauce is way lower than we have gotten in the past, the breadsticks are cold and hard, and overall - we're just disappointed.   I filled out the survey and will say the manager called and left a message for me.  At that point I decided to let it go.  As I said before, one pass.  A month later we ordered again, similar experience with the exception of having a full level of alfredo sauce and hot bread sticks.  We still had to wait longer than our scheduled pick up time.  Then one of our orders was ready and the other was not - therefore by time the other order was ready, the first order is now cold.  Oi, it was just unpleasant.  I filled out another survey, pretty much repeating the first survey, but this time no phone call.    Then someone suggested leaving a Yelp review, so here I am.  My suggestion to management, please have the orders ready at their designated time.  As much as I would prefer sitting and dining in, I have an hour for lunch.  I don't want to spend 10-15 additional minutes of my lunch hour waiting.  My suggestion to others, it's a chain food resturant.  Your mileage will always vary.  Just make sure you plan enough time if you order to go and are crunched for time.

I've lived in the valley since 1994 and surprisingly, never been to Big Surf until yesterday.  I found a great deal on Groupon for $13 per person, so I couldn't pass it up.  In the past, we've always gone to Wet & Wild and the kids have occasionally gone to Sun Splash with their friends.  Finances are tight this year so I figured Big Surf is better than nothing and worth a shot!    First, I love that PARKING IS FREE.  Huge perk.  I planned to spend $8-$10 on parking so that was $$$ saved.  Plus I found a nice shady space pretty close to the gate.  The line to get in was not very long and moved pretty quickly.  We settled in, found a table in a shady area, and put our stuff down.  We also rented a locker for $7 that fit all of our valuables and it was easy enough to use that my 11 year old could work it.  Settled in and off to ride some slides!!  I noticed right away that the park is very old and in disrepair.  It could use a fresh coat of paint and some upgrades.  You can see the entire park from the entrance, as it's not very large.  They don't have very many slides and one of the extreme slides was broken.  HUGE PERK is the water feature on the sidewalks so your feet don't burn.  One disadvantage is no misters on the staircases or ramada areas.  We went on a couple of slides, they were ok.  Nothing exciting enough that I wanted to go back on for a second ride.  The younger kids (11 year olds) of course had a blast.  They rode them over and over again and spent a lot of time in the wave pool.    The wave pool was also just okay.  It would be nice it they had consistent waves and also time without any waves.  A large wave every couple of minutes smashing everyone into everyone else was not something I considered fun.  Again, the 11 years olds enjoyed it.  The teenagers and myself, not too much.  Food was reasonably priced.  Surprisingly in fact.  We were able to get a large one topping pizza for $18 and split between 5 of us (plus a bird who stole a slice).  I noticed other meals ranged $7-9, not too bad.  The pizza was also very good, so worth the money.  They allow unopened water bottles in the park, so we brought our own water to save on drinks.    The teenagers were bored after about two hours, and we ended up spending most of our time in the kiddie pool under the shade.  A lazy river would have been perfect at that point because we just wanted to relax in the water, but couldn't.  If you lean against a wall the lifeguards yell at you (and not in the nicest of ways) and if you sit on the bench in the water under the shade, kids jump and literally climb on you.  I was dying for a lazy river to relax in and so bummed they didn't have one.  It was too hot to lay out.  The only other thing that we noticed was the staff's unhappiness in their jobs.  I am comparing them to the lifeguards at Wet & Wild, who joke and play and smile with the guests.  I hadn't said anything to my 16 year old but when she said "Geez.  It seems like everyone here HATES their job,,," she confirmed what I was noticing.  Even adult supervisors walked around looking mad and irritated, and when you smiled at them they wouldn't smile back. I even tried to joke with a couple of the life guards and they didn't even smile, just looked annoyed.  It was actually kind of sad because it made me wonder how Big Surf treats their employees to make them so unhappy.    Overall opinion, if you have young ones (under 12) and live in the area, it's worth the discounted rate.  Young ones will have fun but teenagers and adults, not so much as there isn't anything thrilling or relaxing for older guests to do.  It would be great if the owners could invest a little money into a classic water park, add some fresh paint, add a thrilling ride or two, and please make a lazy river or at least a specific spot for older guests (13+ maybe) to relax.  Lounge chairs in the pool maybe?  A no splash zone?  Swim up bar?  Something FUN or relaxing.  We will likely not be returning unless they do some rehab.  Wet & Wild is more money but worth it, because staff is friendly, you have more thrilling rides that you don't mind waiting in line for and want to go on over and over again, and they have a relaxing lazy river when you just want to chill.  That being said - it is a great park for those with younger kids.  Less crowded.  Smaller lines.  More affordable.

We've been going to Rio Mirage Cafe for many years, since before we were even Surprise residents, and 9 times out of 10, we have had a great experience.  The food has always been hot and yummy.  Never had a complaint about the food.  Good margaritas,  Great value, not too expensive but not the cheapest Mexican food out there.  The customer service is almost always on point.  We have had a few servers that weren't so friendly (end of night, not busy, but seemed bothered by us) but MOST of the time, they are friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend Rio Mirage, give them a try, and don't forget to order a margarita.

Seriously, as good as it gets!  We've been going to Popo's for well over 15 years and I cannot think of one bad experience, ever.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  The service is fast!  I can take an hour lunch break and still make it back on time.  The food is hot, fresh, and amazingly goof.  Hands down one of the best Mexican food restaurants in the Phoenix area.

Our family has been going to Valle Luna for many years and has never once had a bad experience.  Most recently we drove 30-40 minutes to eat dinner there with our kids and some other family.  The wait is long but that's to be expected... They're popular!  We were given amazing service by an older server and come to find out, this server has worked there for a very long time.  In the restaurant business, it's rare to see someone stay at one place for a long time so we were impressed.  Food was as great as always!  Order their pollo fundido.  Yummmmy!

Our family loves Red Robin, and most of the time, our experience is good.  However on this particular visit, it was a little below the usual level of service.  I believe this location is under new management and you can kind of tell.  The manager walking around looked frazzled.  It was busy so I've taken that into consideration but the wait on the drink order, delivery, and food was rather long.  Our server was very nice and I don't blame her too much.  She was trying her best.  Where I was completely frustrated though is how freezing cold they had the temp in the restaurant.  People around us were complaining and I asked the waitress 4 times if she could please turn it down.  It made the entire experience that much worse.  It's hard enough waiting when you're really hungry but when your hands are literally turning into ice cubes... No Bueno.  She said she told the manager but obviously he didn't care.  He made it a point to go up to almost every table around us to ask how their meal was but avoided our table.  I won't go as far as saying it was intentional but it felt that way.  I am rating 4 stars because typically this location is good, our server was good, and food was good.  The long wait for drinks, food, and insanely cold temp deducts a star.  Hopefully our next experience will be better and new management can get it together.

I don't expect perfection.  Even if we get "ok" service, I won't write a review.  I realize not every dining experience is going to be great.  I try to write primarily positive reviews.  However, last night is the exception.    You see, December 11th is my moms birthday.  So we went to one of her favorite restaurants to celebrate her.  We ordered her favorite appetizer, spinach dip, and fried chicken salads, also her fave.  The only thing missing was my mom, because she passed away nearly four years ago.    Our dining experience started out okay.  We had some trouble with the ordering console on the table, which apparently charged us a $1.99 "entertainment fee".  The server took the console and said "oh that's why" then selected something to make it work.  We stared off with the spinach dip (in honor of mom) and bottomless fries while the kids decided what to order.  And kids, I mean ages 10, 13, and 15.   We ordered my 10 year old son a child's drink but when she refilled his drink, she brought back an adult cup, then charged us an adult beverage.  Food was good, no complaints there, and I liked how the manager swung by to see how we were doing.  Once done and ready to pay, I stared to use the table console and noticed we were charged the $1.99 entertainment fee and an adult soda instead of the child soda.  Granted, it's only a few dollars but if you knew our financial situation, and that we had to SAVE for this dinner to celebrate my moms birthday, every dollar counts.  So I hit the "call server" button and we proceeded to wait, and wait, and wait.  I commented to my husband, "ok service has been ok and now she just disappears..."  She was no where, not at anyone else's table or the kitchen (we were seated near the kitchen) so who knows....  Finally she arrives at our table.  I tell her that she needs to remove the entertainment fee because we didn't play any games and she immediately argues, "it won't charge you if you didn't play a game".  Now I am starting to get irritated because we brought it to HER attention as soon as we got there that it wasn't working and she had to fix it.  She then looks at my 13 year old and says, "you didn't play any games?" and my daughter was confused and replied no.  The server had an attitude and grilled my child.  Then she says she charged an adult drink because she refilled his drink with a large cup, to which I said "that was your choice, we ordered a child's drink..." And then she counters by saying she should have charged us for individual bottomless fries since we all shared but our salads didn't come with bottomless fries.  Now I'm heated...   Ok I get if there policy is an order of bottomless fries per person but I've been here a thousand times and sometimes we all have meals with fries, sometimes only one person does, regardless - bottomless fries have always been shared and no one has ever explained to us that it's per person.  So this was news to us and only an issue after I challenged her other add in charges.  No server has EVER charged us bottomless fries per person, ever.    So at that point I asked for a manager and we proceeded to wait, again, forever.  Heart rate goes up to 128 (thank you fit bit) and I am just done.  We chose this restaurant to celebrate my deceased mothers birthday, ordering her favorites in honor of her, saved our money so we could keep her memory alive, only to have an unhappy chip on her shoulder waitress sour the entire experience by trying to fluff up her tip with all these added charges.  When the manager arrived, I told him why were there and that his waitress ruined the experience, then I walked out.  My husband stayed to pay the bill and all that manager could do is say "sorry" and give us a bogo coupon.  Wow, thanks but no thanks.  We won't be going back for a long while and it certainly will not be the surprise red robin.  I don't take having my moms birthday ruined very lightly.  My previous 5 stars have been downgraded to 1.

Alright.  So my husband and I have both decided that we will never be back to this specific Red Robin again.  Three strikes.  While I appreciate the gift certificate to make up for the previous bad experience, it was followed up by another bad experience.  With the gift certificate clearly on the table, as a subtle hint that we had bad experience before so please step up your game, and nope.  After waiting, I assume about 5 minutes, I set my stop watch.  Another 7 minutes passed and not even a drink order was taken.  The restaurant was steady but not packed or extremely busy.  It appeared our waitress had one group of about 8, and then 2-3 other tables aside from us.  While she greeted us as we sat down and told us she would be right with us, it was over 10 minutes before I finally got up and interrupted a managed in the kitchen.  From that point on, they did improve, and we were comp'd $15 off our bill.  However, I just have a bad taste in my mouth now.  I shouldn't have to complain.  I shouldn't have to chase down a manager to get drinks.  I don't even want the compensation.  I just want to have decent service, especially on a special day.  First my mother's birthday dinner, and then Valentine's Day.  Love the food.  Good as always.  Except, one minor suggestion.  When frying the donuts, please don't fry them in the same fryer as the onion rings.  The donuts tasted very oniony.  I appreciate the effort in getting us to give them another shot, and I appreciate the effort to make it right after I grabbed a manager... but we will go to another RR in the future.

This is my new hometown spot!  Just moved to Surprise a year ago and have fallen in love with Rio Mirage.  The service has been great each and every time, the food hot, delievred quickly, and the margs - yummy.  Affordable too.  My cousin and I hit up Rio Mirage every couple of months for margaritas and everytime, we get the coolest server.  They're so friendly and engaging.  I strongly recommend Rio Mirage!

To start, we were told it would be a half hour wait.  Okay, not a problem.  After all, D&B was a 2-hour wait!  So we waited directly in front of the hostess bar.  30 minutes passes, 45 minutes pass... we go up and ask what's the ETA.  "Uh...."  They erased our names from the wait list on accident!!  We ended up waiting a total of an hour before finally being seated.    We're still cool.  Not too hungry, but ready for drinks.  We wait.  Then we wait some more.  At this point (estimated 10 minutes after being seated), I pulled out my phone and begun to time how long it would take to get waited on.  Servers continue to pass us, so quickly, we couldn't stop them even if we tried.  20 minutes later our waitress says, "oh!  I am so sorry!  I didn't know you guys were here!"    Irritated at this point, but we smile and put in our order for drinks and food.  We have 5 people total and she brings us 4 waters.  My friend asks for a water... she never brings it.    Four of us order the fish bowl.  Yummy drink but WATERED DOWN.  That huge thing didn't even give me a buzz, and I am a light-weight, being that I only drink every few months.  The other girls agreed.  Yummy, cute bowl, but no alcohol.  Our food finally arrives.  Again, she brings us four plate settings for five people, completely skipping over the girl that didn't get a water.  At this point, we all conclude that she doesn't like her.  The girl asks for silverware, and again, her water.    My mom and I order the $18 fajitas.  I figured $18 fajitas would be large enough for us to share.  I WAS WRONG.  The was the most SKIMPIEST plate of fajitas I have ever seen, but double the price.  My mom eats like a bird and even commented, "it's not even enough for me, let alone two people."  We had to dig through the peppers to find a couple of slivers of steak, it was PATHETIC!  We ate what we could and concluded we would be making a Jack in the Box run after our movie.  Eventually my friend got her fork and knife, but never got her water.  In the end... we had to ask for her to rinse our fish bowls... but she never returned.  We waited so long we had to ask someone to get our waitress so we could pay and go.  She returned with our check but not our fish bowls.  We also asked her to split the check in the beginning, but she didn't do this.  She was annoyed when we reminded her we wanted our check split.  After we all paid and were ready to go... we had to wait again.  Finally she showed up and we reminded her about our fish bowls.  "OH YEAH!"  Five minutes later she returned with our fish bowls completely wet... but whatever.  I couldn't get out of that place fast enough.  I would never recommend this place to anyone, neither will I ever go back!!

Met up with some girlfriends for happy hour.  Very busy for a Thursday at 7.  Our waitress was outstanding.  Never had to wait for drinks.  Food was delish!  Everything was fresh.  Very happy with the level of service at this location.

Tried to check in online as they so proudly advertise and kept getting error message after error message.  So I gave up and called to check in over the phone.  Spoke to two very "bothered" and annoyed employees who stated its "corporate policy" not to check in customers over the phone.  I explained that I tried to do it online and was told that they have issues with it and to try again in an hour, otherwise I'll just have to come in and wait.  They have the ability to check in walk ins, check in online, but can't help a customer over the phone when THEIR website doesn't work.  Explain to me why?  They're rude and I took my business elsewhere.  I've always used Great Clips for my kids but no more.  Their employees are disgruntled and obviously can't be bothered trying to help a customer.  I don't leave one star reviews often (see reviews) but this one deserves negative stars.  So disappointed.

We've gone to Brookside a handful of times over the years, mostly for their UFC fight nights (best in town, in our opinion).  Service can be so-so on fight nights.  We did have one specific waitress that we had three times in a tow that was just hands-down awful, that the next time we got her we were going to request someone else. Thankfully, we haven't seen her in a while and haven't had a huge issue with service since.  So on Father's Day my husband wanted to go to Brookside with his dad, who has never been.  We ordered the 50 wing deal and a few appetizers, along with a couple of beers for the dads.  We played pool as well.  We had a really good time, the waitress was attentive and kept the refills coming, food was hot and delish, and overall we had a really good time.  One of the best Father's Day my husband said.  So thank you Brookside and see you at the next UFC!

Never disappointed with Barros.  A little wait sometimes but well worth it.  Customer service is always on point, even with a younger crowd working there.  Good value.  Food is always hot and a hit with everyone in the family.  It's definitely a favorite pizza spot in Surprise.

I went to Panda Express for lunch the other day.  There was a long line in the drive thru so I opted to order inside.  Staff member was refilling bowls and greeted me immediately, said she will be right with me.  She also offered for me to try a sample.  I ordered my usual two entree two sides (chow mein and orange chicken) and cream cheese ragoons.  I had to wait a long time for the orange chicken to be refilled (approx. 10 minutes) but as I waited, staff members smiled and apologized for the delay.  It appeared that a manager was training a new cook so it was easy to understand the delay.  Over all, good experience.  This location has good customer service and my food was hot and fresh.  I'll definitely be back again!

Atmosphere was great.  We sat on the patio, weather was beautiful.  Good selection was very good; we had a hard time deciding what to order!  Food is a little pricey.  We ordered the shrimp appetizer, salad, and a burger.  Everything tastes great, no complaints.  The only reason I am giving them a 4 star is because the service wasn't the best.  We had to wait a long time between visits from the server, a refill at one point took a half an hour, and my cousin never got her salad dressing.... Kind of need salad dressing for a salad.  The server did take the salad off the bill which was cool but the experience would have been 5 stars if we didn't have to wait so long for everything and would have been given salad dressing.  Will definitely give them another shot and update review at that time!

Our family attend Luke Days on Sunday, March 20th and had a good time.  I love that the admission is free, so everyone can see the airplanes and the show.  We did arrive early so we didn't have any issues with traffic or parking.  Everything was very organized.  The show was awesome and the kids loved it!  We will definately be going again next year.  However, there is room for improvement.  The food was good but VERY pricey.  The kid zone was also very pricey and the lines for the bounce houses were awful.  We waited 30-40 minutes for the kids to go on the rocket ship bounce house and they all agreed that it was NOT worth it.  The rides the older kids wanted to go on, were too much money.  I understand they have to make up for the free admission for $10 per kid to go inside of plastic ball or jump on a trampoline, or $4 for a small fry, or $5 for a lemonade - even Disneyland is cheaper.    Suggestions for visitors next year:  bring your own chair (rentals are $5 a chair and the ground is uncomfortable), bring your own water but don't open until you're inside, bring plenty of snacks, and don't show your kids the kid zone unless you prepared to spend a lot of money.

About a week ago, we went to Jack in the Box for a quick cheap dinner.  Ordered a bunch of value menu items, including a couple of special orders (plain for the picky eaters).  Cashier (female) not so pleasant, got our order wrong.  We were told to pull around so we did, and waited.  Rich delivered our food to our window, and I said, "I hope the order is all correct..." Because, usually the order is not correct when they deliver to the car.  Rich said, "it is" and I jokingly said "ok, I'm trusting you!" We drove home and lo and behold, the order was wrong.  We were missing a sandwich, had a sandwich we didn't order, were short a fry, and the sandwiches that were supposed to be plain for my picky eaters, were not.  I called the store and asked to speak to the mgr.  Rich said he was the mgr on duty.  I jokingly said, "rich, you disappoint me.  You lied to me."  Then proceeded to explain what happened.  Rich had great customer service and without hesitation, said that I could come in for a full refund and he would duplicate the order.  I told him I wasn't coming back tonight because I was done for the night but I'd take him up on that offer later.  So about a week later... My husband went in and spoke to Rich.  Another mgr came in, a young cocky kid on a power trip.  He was very rude to my husband and said, no, they don't replace an entire order or refund.  He then proceeds to question Rich in a very rude demeaning manner in front of my husband, so harsh in fact my husband felt the need to interrupt and tell him he shouldn't be so mean to his employees.  It's unprofessional, ESPECIALLY in front of the customer.  He then said "frankly I don't care, whatever, it's on Rich." Then walked away saying "not trying to be a jerk".  They ended up replacing the order but did not refund as promised.  The entire ordeal was ridiculous.  Not sure "who" Rich is on the totem pole but we appreciate his effort in trying to rectify the situation professionally.  As for the young skinny punk kid, someone needs to humble him.

New customer right here!  I am extremely please with the level of customer service I witnessed from the owner herself!!!  She handled a tough situation with grace and went above and beyond to provide her customer with the highest level of customer service!  I will be referring to Musical Surprise for all future needs!!!

An absolutely beautiful community, inside and out.  From the moment you drive in, you can tell the crew takes care of their grounds and has pride in their community.  The layouts of the units are spacious and modern.  The office staff is top notch old fashion customer service.  Lots of amenities as well.  Definitely worth a tour to see for yourself!

I have never attended church before.  My daughter convinced me to go and at first I felt uneasy.  It was a new experience for me.  Now, over a year later, I love my church.  The staff is incredible and the people that attend are some of the best people I've ever met.  They have a great program for the kids, tweens, and teens.  As well they offer neighborhood groups.  The bands are great too!  I cannot say enough about CCV!!

Ask for Kayla!  She's the best.  I'm sure they're all great but Kayla has been the only gal to touch my hair in years!  Never disappointed.  Now she's doing my daughters hair.  Customers for life.

I have a young cat that became very ill.  We took him to the emergency vet over the weekend, not knowing the the Surprise Animal Hospital is open on the weekends.  The emergency vet wanted to charge us $665 to care for our sick kitten.  So I opted to take him home and follow up with a local vet, since he wasn't in any immediate danger.  The Surprise Animal Hospital is very close to us, next door to Frys where we often shop, so I called them first.  They got us an appointment and from start to finish, the experience was very pleasant!  They were very careful and kind with my scared little kitty, handled him very calmly.  He was actually very calm with them, and he is the kind  of kitty that hides when guests come over.  After checking him over, we received half off our first visit, got some antibiotics, and it cost us only $55.  That was a lot better than $665 at the emergency vet!!!  To top it off, they called a few days later to follow up and see how our cat was doing.  We will definitely be using the Surprise Animal Hospital as our cat's vet from here on out.

I really hate to give this place 2 stars because quite honestly the food is good.  We have eaten there a handful of times since moving to Surprise in 2013 and not once have we been dissatisfied with what we order.    However, my reason for the 2 stars is solely because of the one older woman that works the register.  We have gotten her everytime we've been there to take our order and she is unpleasant to put it nicely.  At first, we chalked it up to a bad day.  My husband and I both work in customer service, so we understand the frustrations.  We are very patient, especially with food service.  It's not an easy job - we get it.  However, after the second, third, fourth time of having a similar encounter with this woman, we realized she is just an unhappy miserable person who really should work behind the scenes.  She is very rude and no matter how hard you try to kill her with kindness, her negative energy swallows any and all positive energy you try to give her way.    We would honestly go there more if we didn't risk having to deal with her.  She ruins the experience of eating out, and I would prefer not to waste money being made to feel unwelcome and uncomfortable.    So if you can put one employees unpleasantness aside - it is worth dining there on occasion.  If you have no tolerance for bad customer service, avoid it at all costs.

Updating my previous review of two stars and downgrading to one star.  As I previously stated in my last review, the food is good but the service is awful.  The old woman that mans the register, happens to the owner herself.  We stopped going there after a handful of very bad interactions with her.  I excused the first couple of bad experiences but quickly realized she is just a mean person.  Therefore, we stopped going.  Fast forward to over a year later... my 15 year old daughter decided to apply for a job at Jims.  We strongly advised her to not get a job there because if the woman is rude to paying customers, she is probably worse to employees.  My daughter has a friend that just got hired there, and being 15, she didn't have very many options outside of babysitting.  So she SETTLED and went in to interview.  She was never asked to apply, provide documentation for her identity, or told how much she would be paid and when.  She was told they needed a pretty face to hostess and be there at 9:00 on Saturday.  We tried to prepare our daughter the best we could; don't take anything she says personal, she's rude to everyone, even her customers.  Just do what she says, yes ma'am, work hard, etc.  She showed up early, ready to work.  Worked 7 hours, no break, treated like dirt, and then at the end of her shift - she was given $10 and told to come back tomorrow at 9.  My daughter was discouraged and so disappointed.  $10 for 7 hours?  So I called to inquire about her pay and why she wouldn't take her documentation.  I was told to get a lawyer.  I was also told that I am drunk, medicated, and crazy (all of which I have on recording).  A short time after that phone call, we were informed that this owner/grown woman called my daughter's 15 year old friend and told him that I cussed her out and need to apologize.  She didn't call me or my daughter.  And for the record, I didn't "cuss her out".  She's crazy and I will be contacting the labor board if she does not pay my daughter for her 7 hours with the next two weeks.  So as a former customer who gave this place 2 stars for good overpriced food, long waits, and horrible customer service - I now give this place 1 star for bad business practices, unethical behavior, and complete INSANITY from a very rude OWNER.

Probably the best burger place in Surprise that's full service restaurant.  Always clean and inviting.  We've always been greeted as soon as we come in, customer service friendly, easy ordering, good menu options, good value for your money.  Food is delivered hot and nothing is left on your plate.

Beautiful park.  The playground is super fun for the kids, even my Tweens like to play there.  Love the lake.  A little stinky from the lake/fish and lots of duck/geese poop but they can't help Mother Nature!!

Decided to have an easy dinner night and get the family some sandwiches.  My daughter ordered her sandwich first then I proceeded to order 4 other sandwiches for the rest of the family.  I noticed the veggies all looked old and were browning so I left a lot of veggies off our sandwiches.  I asked the girl, who didn't speak at all and looked very unhappy, to add extra mayo and she seemed annoyed.  She squeezed a little out but not what I consider extra.  As I am paying I could tell my daughter looked disappointed.  I asked what was up and she said nothing. Once we were in the car she told me she asked for more olives and pickles and the girl ignored her.  I asked why she didn't say anything and she said that girl is always rude and miserable and didn't feel like dealing with her.  She goes to this :-\ way frequently but said she is going to start going to the other location because it's gotten really bad.  Upon arriving home to eat, we all discovered the bread was hard.  The kids bread was too hard to eat in some places.  Disappointed considering how much we spent for our family of 5 to eat.  I'm unlikely to go back to this location.

I've only been a couple of times but every time we've been, it's been packed!!  We are greeted immediately, despite how busy they are.  The food has always been delivered quickly, hot and fresh, good, and the service has never disappointed.  Definitely worth your business!!

The order was very simple.  Spoken in very clear English, slowly because I could tell the girl was having a hard time.  I repeated the order.  Asked her to repeat the order.  Corrected the order.  Confirmed the correction.  A co-worker came to help us because she just could not handle it.  Employee repeated order.  I corrected the order.  Swiped the card, paid, was give ONE cup for FIVE meals.  Manager comes over, asks for receipt, said I only had four meals.  Frustrated but still calm, I told her the entire order.  Very slowly and clearly: 2 #1's large, 2 #2's PLAIN "meat cheese bun only" and medium, 1 #10 large and 1 hot and spicy.  She tells me she will comp the missing #2.  The original cashier STILL gives me 4 cups, not 5.  Not sure how she's not capable of simple kindhearted addition, but I move on.  Get our drinks.  Order is ready, check order, missing a fry.  Highly annoyed but still remaining calm.  Mgr gets the 5th fry.  We leave.  Get home.  Burgers covered in pickles, ketchup, mustard... Yeah, no flying with my two picky eaters.  I throw the burgers and MY meal in the bag, since now I don't get to eat, and head back.  Mind you, I drove to this location although it is further from my home because the one closest to me ALWAYS got the order wrong.  This location typically was on it.  On this specific occasion, I went IN rather than drive thru to make sure the order would be right.  I didn't want the headache of going through, everything I ended up going through.  So I get there and ask for a refund.  Mgr doesn't apologize.  She doesn't offer compensation.  Nothing.  She's annoyed with ME.  I suggested that perhaps the girl shouldn't be left to fend for herself on the register alone yet if she can't handle it.  She said she's new.  I told her I get being new but this is beyond "she's new" this is ridiculous.  I asked for the general managers number and she gave me the 800 number.  As though the McDonalds call center is going to do anything.  Mgr on duty gives me a refund for 4 burgers, a 10 piece, and lrg fry (everything i brought back).  She should have refund the entire meal for the inconvenience.  Never going back.  Done with McDonalds and the dummies they hire.

Husband and I went last night for happy hour and had a great experience.  From start to finish: we were greeted immediately.  The place was packed so there was a little wait.  While we waited, we were asked by two other staff members if we had been helped, which was awesome.  I was observing how the servers spoke to the hostesses and happy to see they were kind, not rude at all.  The hostesses jumped right in to help clear tables, wipe them down, grab a pizza box for one of the servers, and always carried a smile on their faces.  Once seated, we were greeted by our server right away.  He had a ton of personality, very friendly, attentive, and didn't hold back on the ranch.  It's a pet peeve of mine when I ask for "a lot of ranch" and they bring me one container... which this server did not.  He was kind and gave us just enough for our meals.  Food was delivered hot.  We ordered appetizers for happy hour: spinach dip, fried zucchini, potato skins, and nachos.  All of which was delish, but the spinach dip and friend zucchini are hands down the best in Surprise.  My husband devoured the nachos.  All for a great happy hour price.  This is now going to be our regular spot... and we were excited to hear that they host UFC fights with NO COVER. Next fight in March we are going to Tailgaters.

Our family has gone to this location multiple times in the 3 years we have lived in Surprise, and we've never been disappointed.  Last night we drove through for a late dinner after a very long day.  The wait time was minimal, the line was short, and the girl that took our order was very bubbly and friendly.  The order was accurate, we were not missing anything, which is such a huge plus when you're tired and just want to go home and eat.  Food was hot and fresh.  They're a little more pricey than places like Mc Donalds but worth it for the better food quality, order accuracy, and friendlier service.  We will continue to go back!!  We love their chicken finger... my husband loves the Chicago dog, and their all beef hot dogs are delish.  I'm not a huge shoestring fry fans but when you drench it in Freddi sauce and eat it with a fork, it's great!  Learned that from my teenager.  :)

First time visiting this location despite living here nearly two years.  Customer service was excellent by the two employees that helped us.  We received our coffee and food very quickly; hot and fresh.  Establishment was very clean.  Will make it a point to go back more often!

I took my daughters to Rue 21 yesterday to spend their Rue Bucks and Cash and gift cards.  They were having a pretty good sale and the store was busy.  To be expected a few days after Christmas.  The staff was helpful when I asked a young man some questions about the coupons and the rules in using them.  I wanted to make sure I understood how they could be used.  The young girl we helpful when I asked if the buy one get one for $5 applied to all buy one get one for $5, or just on the same rack.  I could see how my questions may be annoying but with so many loopholes these companies have on sales, I wanted to be cleared BEFORE we got to the register.  I overheard that their credit/debit was down; some customers were mad at the manager for this.  They were also getting mad about the rue bucks; they apparently didn't read the small print or ask questions.  The manager handled these people very patiently, probably more patience than I would have had with them.  They treated her really badly, as though SHE broke the debit/credit machine and SHE made the coupon rules.  I had the pleasure of her helping me ring my enormous pile of merchandise up, used 4 rue bucks cards, and in another transaction $30 in rue cash.  She was friendly, patient, engaging, and overall very customer service friendly.  5 stars for her!!  We ended up paying $80 for approx. $210 worth of merchandise.  5 stars for that!  My only suggestion, if the credit/debit machine is down, I would put a sign in the door so people know before they begin shopping and take their items to the register.  Or inform shoppers as they're shopping.  I could see how it would be frustrating if you didn't have cash to spend time shopping, never knowing, until the end.  Nonetheless, it wasn't THEIR fault; people need to chill.

We could not be any happier with the service we received from Wes at West Coast Pest Control!  He took his time to cover inside and out, is personable, friendly, and provides top notch customer service.  We have been raving about our experience to all of our friends and family.  Great prices, and we haven't seen a scopion since!  We will continue to use West Coast Pest Control for all of our pest control needs in the future.

Second visit to this location and will never be back again.  Walked up with my cart to aisle 14 which had two customers ahead of me and scanned over to aisle 16 to see if line was better.  Aisle 15's light was off and I've never been that person to go to a register with their light turned off.  The cashier at register 15 looked at me and very rudely said "I'm closed!" and It shocked me because I was already in a line and was looking at the aisle behind her, not her.  I replied back "wasn't planning on going in your line lady, chill" and she spouted something back that I couldn't understand.  Annoyed but moved over to aisle 16 as her line was shorter.  As I am I loading my items onto the belt, I hear this chick at aisle 15 tell someone she will take them.  I turned around and was shocked.  I wasn't even in her line and got yelled at and then she proceeds to help this family. Light still off she take another customer.  I was baffled.  She went out of her way to yell to me that she's closed but then proceeds to help two others after me.  After I was done I went to the customer service counter but no one was there.  This is the busiest time of day right after work and no staff to assist.  I went up to the self check out clerk and asked for a manager.  He scanned around and I stopped him, said nevermind.  I told him I would call instead and asked for the girls name at 15.  He said Christina.  He then turned to Christina and said I wanted to talk to her.  Which I didn't! She turned around with a huge attitude and asked what the problem was.  I told her she was the problem, and I will talk to a manager about it.  She said she was trying to take her lunch but was required to help those people (so she knew what she did) and so I responded, yet you yell to me you're closed when I wasn't even going in your lane but then proceed to help 2 others after me? She walked away from me.  She knew exactly what she did and is very wrong for doing it.  If she was going to continue helping customers, she should have offered to assist me or turn her light on.  If she is going to go out of her way to yell at me and tell me she's closed, then don't take two people after me.  I kept hearing raves about this store and after today's experience, I'll stick with my neighborhood Frys.  Not always perfect but a hell of a lot better than Winco.

Immediately upon walking in this establishment, you feel welcome and appreciated.  The couple that owns the restaurant are smiling ear to ear, very friendly, and you almost feel like you just walked into a family BBQ.  You can watch them make your food, the menu options are hard to choose from, and before you know it, the food it ready to eat.  My husband and I both ordered something different so we could share and try a couple of different items, and wow, everything was so tasty!!!  The entire experience was good from start to finish and we will definitely be going back!!!

Decided to check out the new restaurant with the hubby and son.  Upon entering we were greeted immediately by very friendly staff.  We loved the make over from the previous restaurant.  My husband and son ordered wings, and I ordered the bacon grilled cheese sandwich. We also order the pretzel bites.  Service was good.  Our server Teagan was very friendly and attentive.  Food was not horrible but nothing to rave about either.  The wings weren't that good according to my husband and the grilled cheese wasn't even melted.  The pretzel bites honestly tasted like microwavable frozen food.  It was all just-ok.  We did like that the managers/owners were going around to the tables asking for honest feedback.  While I was not going to complain, he asked, so I have my honest review.  They're new and I believe with some tweaking they can be really good.  We are happy they're going to have the UFC.  Definitely will try them again after they get settled in and maybe if they have happy hour on the apps.

I was super excited about this new gym!  Had every intention to join.  Decided to wait for grand opening weekend to join, thinking they would have a great deal.  I came in that weekend and was told no specials.  I thought it was weird since they're new and with the previous bad rep this location had, I thought they would have good deals. Disappointed the guy took my name and number and said he would reach out if something came up.  I personally think this gym is for the already fit and they saw my weight, and didn't want me.  Nonetheless, waited a few weeks to follow up and today, I called, and was told they ran sign up specials during grand opening.  I was very irritated because I was told no specials during grand opening!!!  I was lied too.  So needless to say, taking our family membership to Mountainside with 0 enrollment and 2 weeks free.  A little more monthly but has far more classes, better yoga, and steam room.  Worth the extra $40.

Being a Cali girl, I was super excited to see a donut shop open up near me that was NOT Krispy Kreme or Dunkin Donuts.  We went in the late afternoon and surprisingly, they had a large selection of donuts.  We order two dozen (birthday celebration) and they were a hit.  Everyone ate them up!  Very fresh, not stale, and delish!  Customer service was OK.  Not over the top but not horrible.  We will definitely be back.
