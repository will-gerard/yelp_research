I remember going where when I was a boy scout. It was very fun and interesting. I love the desert vegetation and loved seeing and learning about what is what! I haven't been lately but we are planning on it. I would recommend going and if you don't have an appreciation for the desert you will after you go here.

This is the best Cajun resturant in Arizona. I've lived in Louisiana before and this is as close as it gets for AZ. I had the crawfish ettouffe and its was awesome and the most authentic I've had since living in Louisiana. My wife had the sampler and she loved it. The atmosphere is great. The live music added to the experience. It was kinda loud though. The waitress was kind of wierd. I would recommend this to anyone looking for some good  cajun food. It is on the pricey side but its worth it.

My wife and I visited LGO a while back and we were both impressed and enjoyed our meal. The WINGS were by far the best I have ever tasted. Our pizza was great, we had the pepperoni and ricotta. It does get kinda crowded and chaotic on weekend nights. The grocery store in pretty cool but didn't buy anything. Like a previous review, it did feel like a upscale Cracker Barrel. All around a great place to eat. Also, Take a camera so you can take pictures of all the lame hipster clowns that try to make it all about them. They are the only downside to LGO.

I was excited to find a Popeyes here is AZ. The ones I used to go to in Louisiana were good. They had etouffee and mardi gras cheesecake that were great. This one is awful. The chicken was old and not fresh. The red beans and rice were runny. It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.

When I'm in the mood for a creamy desert I will always go to Nielsen's. I prefer the baseline/power location but this one is bigger. I do miss the Iceberg that use to be in this location. I like the choices of mix-ins for the custard. I always get Captin Crunch and Maraschino Cherries. Sadly I do not visit this place much anymore cause of my addiction to tart frozen yogurt, but when I get the creamy craving I go to Nielsens.

For being a fast Hawaiian food joint Mokis is great! Way better than the Ono Hawaiian grill places. The food at Mokis is fresh and tastey. I always get the BBQ chicken and love it. The macaroni salad is good and I usually dont like macaroni salad. Mokis is affordable and in a quiet location. The staff has always been nice and helpful.

Our dog Gidget was crying in the middle of the night and didn't know what was wrong so we looked up this place cause it was right across the street from us and went. No one was there so we got right in and the staff was very nice and professional. We were in and out in an hour and Gidget was feeling doing fine. This place is open 24/7 and is for sure where we will always go for our emergency vet needs.

We had lunch here and loved it. Had a wonderful sandwich and everyone in our group loved everything they got. But to be honest the dessert we had, still to this day, pleasantly haunts my dreams. We ordered the GIANT layered chocolate cake and the cake was SO moist, I couldn't believe it. But the frosting blew my mind, and I'm fat mind you, so I have high standards. The frosting was like fudge from Disney World or Rocky Mountain Chocolate factory. It was totally unbelievable. I occasionally have to ask my wife if that was a real experience cause it was amazing and sometimes I think it had to have been only a dream, but it was real. Love this place.

Pita Jungle in general gets 4 stars, this location gets 2. This location at night is packed. The tables are always so close together and they pack 3 million people in a relatively small area. Its on the border of a fire hazard. I would rather have some space and have to wait for a table, then to be packed like sardines. The loud music on the weekend is annoying. The food is phenomenal, but try the Mesa or Gilbert location.

This place is so overrated. The food is mediocre at best. The seating is horribly packed together and feels like a elementary school cafeteria. The layout of where you order is awkward and confusing. I got the spaghetti and meatballs and the garlic bread was stale and not hot with like a finger sized stripe of garlic butter on it. I would take subway over Jasons deli. It was such a disappointment since I heard it was so good.

This place is great. We went because we are a fan of Joe's BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill. We were not disappointed with the food or atmosphere.  I had the grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and tomatos and the potato salad. The potato salad was the best I have ever had and the grilled cheese was the best I ever had, and I have had MANY versions of both meaning that I have a little bit of a weight problem. But anyways Liberty Market is worth a try and Im sure you will want to go back. It kinda reminds me of a cooler version of La Grande Orange.

As far as Arcades go, Gameworks PWNS all, at least in AZ. The only reason that it doesn't get 5 stars is becuase it is a bit pricey. If you can find deals for like an hour or two of unlimited play, it is really worth it. They always have updated games. The House of the Dead series is always fun to play. They have such a variety. If you like Pinball, they have tons of pinball. If you like 1st person shooter games, they have tons. If you like ticket producing games, they have tons of them, if you like air hockey, they have the coolest air hockey tables. They just have so much to do. Its worth a good night of game playing fun.

Manuel's is better than your Serrano's or Garcia's but that's not saying much.  The chips and salsa are good. I usually get any variation of their Chimichanga, which is good but I've had better. This place use to be way cooler when they had the green chili costume and they use to dress up and dance for you on your birthday by request. WTF happened? It was the only thing I would look forward to when my wife's family would take me here. Try Cantina Laredo or Cravings before this place.

As far as hot dogs go this place PWNS all. Nothing better than a wonderful grilled hot dog. This place is simple and yummy! I have also had the grilled chicken sandwich was amazing. If you live here and like hot dogs but haven't been to Ted's you need to re-evaluate your life and get a hold of yourself.

I love YCs. My wife doesn't like going with me cause she is  embarrassed by how high I stack my bowl. I stack it to the point that when they are done cooking it they need to use 2 bowls! Don't be ashamed people! Stack as high as you possibly can. You will have left overs for a week. The ingredients are always fresh and I always get the Mongolian combo of sauces. They are great. Also, make yourself a bowl of brown rice and put a scoop of the chicken soup in it. Its awesome and free!

I loved the atmosphere of this place. I have seen hundreds of shows in my life from stadiums to quaint places like this. I prefer places like the Trunk Space. I saw the Miniature Tigers here a few weeks ago and it was great. To be honest, the sound system isn't the greatest but is perfect for indie/folk bands. The people that worked there were all very nice. I hope the rumors of this place shutting down are not true. We have lost the Modified and I hope this place can survive. The music scene in the valley had fizzled out and seems to be getting even worse. We need more places like The Trunk Space.

My wife and I saw a musical here and loved the theatre. Loved the atmosphere. The grounds outside are beautiful. My wife is a photographer and uses the grounds for family pictures and other shoots. We actually had our engagement pictures taken here when it first opened. Defiantly worth a stop by to walk around the grounds, especially at night, it looks so cool at night. Because of this place, Mesa gets an extra star, its now up to 3 stars (how i wish we could review cities :)

This was my first German food experience. I was hesitant at first, but after we went, I was impressed. I had the Fried cornish game hen and it was yum with a side of Spaetzle and I could have had a whole plate of that! I haven't gone back but I need to.

We came to Red White & Brew as a quite large group and they were very accommodating. I was a little hesitant to come here since I don't drink and it had brew in the name, so I didn't know if the food would be any good. Well I was wrong. I had the meatball calzone and it was amazing, probably the best I have had.  The complimentary garlic bread was awesome. I have heard the pizza is great but have not yet tried it. I will for sure be coming back .

I love the Mining Camp. Though I like to stay out of Apache Junction as much as possible, this is worth the trek. The atmosphere is fun and unique. The wait staff is super nice and friendly. You can't beat the all you can eat mounds of ribs and chicken that are thrown in your face. The prickley pear cactus jelly for the bread is amazing. All the food is amazing and everything is all you can eat.  The only reason that it doesn't get 5 stars is because the fact that they don't offer soda, only water and tea.

The atmosphere is at the Sugar Bowl is fun. This place has become a family tradition with my wife and I. We love coming here for dessert and occasionally dinner. The food is real cheap and just a typical diner food with good sandwiches and soups. They have great Italian sodas and shakes and tons of huge banana splits and sundaes. I would recommend the Sugar Bowl to anyone. Parking can be a pain if you go on the weekend nights but worth it.

The sushi is alright. Service was terrible and annoying and the music is to loud. I was trying to count the number of douche bags and annoying chicks but I legitimately can not count that high. You will wait forever to be seated and ignored if you do not buy alcohol. There are 10 other places I will go to before i go to any Ra resturant.

I can't believe I have not Yelped Pop the Soda Shop yet LOL! I have been going here since well before it moved to the new location. Pop the Soda shop has introduced me to so many amazing drinks that I actually crave and can only find at Pop's. I love being able buy in bulk or stop by and pick one or two random bottles out of the coolers. They have such a massive variety already cold which is amazing. I consider myself a connoisseur(in training) of soda, so this place is heaven. To think of it I would even live in the attic of this place if it was legal and not creepy and If I could go back in time I would have moved my wedding to Pop's and walked down the middle isle of soda. I love Pop the Soda Shop.

When I was trying to impress my (at the time) girlfriend, I planned a sweet date and it started with a tour of Teliesin West and had such a blast. Needless to say she became my wife :) So it worked and would recommend  it anyone. It did help that my wife was studying architecture :) This place is so beautiful and has such pretty views. I recommend going at the sunset tour, I believe it was, at the time, more expensive but worth it.

We have only gone to Tempe Camera for repairs of our DSLR. We had a cracked LCD screen and went to Ritz camera and they told us a minimum of  $300 and it would take weeks, so we took it to Tempe Camera and it took like 4 days and $50. They were honest and totally down to earth. They could have screwed us but they didn't. That shows a lot about a company.  I have heard they have good classes but have yet to partake. I would recommend this place HANDS DOWN.

If you wanna take me to get some Mexican, this is one of only three that I would pay for with my own money. This isn't gourmet or anything, but everything I have had here is super tasty, they have some of the best chips and salsa around, even if it is reused :)  It is kinda cramped inside when it is busy, but the seats are comfortable and it has been around for years and has some history.

When I was younger and first moved to Arizona, Serrano's on Rural Road became a family tradition to get mexican food. It was basically all I knew till adulthood. If I would have reviewed this place 10 years ago, it would have been 5 stars but now the blinders are off and I have money to try better places. One by one they all seem to dwarf Serrano's in most every way. I feel kinda guilty writing this and hope my family does not read this :) But it has to be said. I would still eat at Serrano's but it doesn't have the same feeling anymore. The Chimichangas are good and their bean dip is awesome. Nothing I have had is gross or anything but its just   basic greasy mexican food. There are better places out there. Once again to any family reading this....I'm sorry :)

This is the OG triple OG Quiktrip. The summer this one opened in high school, they had free soda FOR THREE MONTHS! It was the best summer of my life. All Quiktrips dominate all gas stations and convenience stores. The staff is always friendly and you never have to wait in line cause they check you out as fast as possible. I get kinda anxious cause everyone is moving so freaking fast and it makes me nervous. Their donuts are F'n amazing! Their Maple Bars are the size of your F'n forearm and melt in your mouth. Their deli sandwiches and breakfast sandwiches are great. They sell cold 2 liters and 12 packs of soda. I would live in a convenience store if I could. My wife hates going with me cause I like to walk around looking for new snacks and take my time like I am in Toys R Us or something. All Quiktrips are awesome and would pick it over ANY store out there.

I worked at the Dairy Queen in this complex for 5 years and loved this place. I still go when I am in the area. Their breakfast sandwich croissants are sooo good! Get the bacon, egg and cheese croissant and you wont be disappointed. The service is not the best but they are super nice. They don't always pick the brightest crayons in the box for employees but they are giving high school kids the chance to work, which is fine with me. This place is good and deserves at lease a try. I would take their breakfast sandwiches over the crap at a Starbucks or Einstein's.  Give it a try if you are in the area.

Tot's is awesome! I actually like it more than Pei Wei (which I like a lot). I just don't go as often since I don't live in Tempe anymore. But anyways, everything I have had here has been awesome. The sesame chicken, the orange chicken are amazing. I seriously don't think they have a bad item on the menu. Young is the guy that runs the place and is super nice. It is always super packed at night time. This is one of the best kept secrets in Tempe as far as I'm concerned. I hope they open up another store someday.

You don't even know how many Dairy Queen paychecks I would throw down at Eastside ever other Friday! I swear at least  80% of my income as a young 16 yr. old boy went to this place. They always had what I needed and I also collect vinyl so they have a great collection of vinyl also. The workers are so cool, I use to want to be as cool as they were when I grew up, but obviously wasn't successful. This place still rocks and I am sad that I don't really go anymore cause of my online purchasing habits, but I need to make it back over there.

Zia, Eastside and Bookmans are the Trinity when it comes to record stores and its kinda funny and convenient that Zia and Eastside they are like 100 feet away from each other. An AWESOME selection of used CDs and good selection of new. They have tons of DVDs and vinyl.  This is your stop for any CD/DVD needs. The Vinyl selection at Zia is better for your new vinyl needs and not so much for used classic vinyl.  Although the back ally parking is kinda sketchy and I can't get my wife to go with me. Plus its lock that there will be a bum out front asking for money. But its worth parking in murder alley and getting hustled by bums. Still 5 stars.

Went to the free screening of 500 Days of Summer last week here and it was a good experience. Even though it is not stadium seating, I could barely notice. Camelview is great because you get to see independent movies that you would not be able to see in the big theaters. it was clean and the staff was nice. But the best part is that there are no annoying teenie boppers cluttering up the atmosphere. I'm excited to go come back and see another movie. We need a cool theater like this in the East Valley.

Seriously, Ikea has everything you need when it comes to getting the necessities for a new home, college student or kids room. Yeah, its not always the best quality stuff but the selection is amazing. The place is a giant maze but its to the point where we know our way around now.  I'm sick of the snoody losers bashing this place for the quality. If you don't know this place is like most stores where there are tiers of quality, you are retarded. Its like any other store, the real cheap stuff is cheap and the more expensive stuff is better quality. We have had our 2 leather couches for 2 years and they are sturdy as a rock and wouldn't trade them for anything. Our office desk  and our credenza are awesome as well. If you are looking for quality you have to pay for it, even at Ikea. I love this place. Not to mention the food!

I have always had a great experience every time I have seen a show. Amphitheaters are not normally my thing but this place does its job. I always prefer indoor concerts 9 time out of 10 but sometimes I can't help it if a band is coming that I want to see. This place has always been clean and spacious. I like the convenient location and parking.  I have seen 311, Something Corporate, Death Cab for Cutie and Jenny Lewis and the Watson Twins here and have all been great experiences.

Best BBQ in the Phoenix metro area. The home made red cream soda and home made root beer is amazing. All the meats are tasty. The home made BBQ sauce is great. My favorites are the pulled pork, potato salad, chocolate chip cookies. There are lots of seating and very family friendly. If you live in the PHX metro area and you havent been to Joe's, I dont know what you have been doing with your life.

I love the drive in movies. Its such a classic experience for such a cheap price and you get more for your money. I have not gone to the snack bar or the bathrooms so I don't know that goes. But if you are halfway smart you will stop at a Circle K before hand hand and load up on the goods for the movie.  Its is also fun with groups when you can bring a couch or lawn chairs to sit outside and kick back.  This place is not luxury by any means but awesome none the less.   My wife doesn't like going cause she thinks its is a dive but I love going and would always go there If I had the choice.

When it comes to chain delivery pizza, Hungry Howie's and Papa Johns take all. Hungry Howie's is good fast pizza. But realistically I think that it takes the cake because of the crust selections!   -Original -Ranch -Cajun -Onion -Garlic Herb -Butter -Butter Cheese -Sesame.  The fact that you get to choose your crust is a genius concept and I would take Howies over Pizza Hut, Dominos, and most other big pizza chains.

Of the top pizza delivery chains, Papa John's takes it. I have worked as a delivery driver for a Papa Johns in the past, and though I hated the one I worked at. They really do have the freshest ingredients and their dough is fresh and is not frozen like pizza hut (also worked there). They are usually on the longer side when it comes to delivery times but its worth the extra weight for its freshness. They also use heated delivery pouches so the pizza is always super hot when it is delivered.

Most overrated place in Gilbert for 2008 goes to Oregano's. The pizza sucks. The pastas are great. Especially the 6 inch Ravioli. The hostess and wait staff have been sometimes rude and annoying. If you want pizza, go to Grimaldi's. Because this place is so overrated, there is always an ungodly wait to be seated. Don't even waste your time. There are better places.

I tried this place based on the reviews I read and I really liked it. Its was kinda busy but we were taken care of pretty quickly. We got the cheese sticks as an appetizer and they were the best that I have had. We ordered the Sicilian pizza not knowing that it was the size of a refridgerator. We could only eat like a pieces and a half each and we were full and had leftovers for 2 days and it was only like $14. This place is a deal and it is great pizza.

Crap, how could this place NOT get 5 stars. The fact that it is a PB & J restaurant is enough for 4 stars. PB Loco is original and delish. To be honest I stay away from the weird crap like the curry PB and sun dried tomato crap. You get to choose your bread and combo of different peanut butters, I like the white chocolate peanut butter, raspberry jam and marshmallow cream. They are grilled on a panini maker and are served with animal crackers. This place is a genius concept and everyone should try.

My wife and I stayed here one night and we loved it. We stayed in the 'King Cabana' room. The design of the rooms and bathroom were awesome. The flat panel TVs were a nice touch, the beds were comfortable. The bathroom had a nice shower and a separate big tub to take a nice bath in. It is in a great location close to downtown Scottsdale and the mall. It is worth a stay if you are coming from out of town or if you taking a 'stay-cation'.

Cosmo park is great and a good idea for Gilbert. We use to take our dog Gidget there all the time but she gets to nervous around other dogs and it was causing he lots of stress. But the facilities are nice. Especially now that they have a timid dog area. The only downfall is lots of the dog owners are borderline retarded and don't watch their dogs to make sure they behave which has caused problems almost everytime we have gone. But overall a great place to take your pooch.

I do enjoy Sauce. The Pizzas are great, not the best around but they are good. This place is a bit pricey for what it is but still worth it. The Panninis are great and always hit the spot. They give you actual glasses  for your soda and have to ask for a to go cup, which is kinda annoying, but thats just a small issue.

We have been looking for a good sushi joint close by that is good and not to pricey. I always saw this place but never tried it but saw reviews for its and decided to give it a try. It was great, the best I have had so far. They had a great Hawaiian roll of some sort that was awesome. We basically had a few of their various rolls since we are just beginners at Sushi. We are not hardcore like some but this place did its job and hit the spot. I like the quaint atmosphere and really nice wait staff. It was really dark inside which took a bit for my eyes to get use to :) But all around I loved it.

I don't know what it is but all buffet food taste the same no matter where you are. I love Golden Corral. There is lot and lots of options for everyone in the family and the ROLLS are awesome. If you are a fan of Buffets you of course will love this place. But if you are a snoody prideful clown, don't even bother.

D.I. is what the kids are calling it these days. D.I. is the best thrift store around. The place looks nicer than a Sears. Everything is clean and organized. They have tons of everything in all of their sections. The place doesn't smell as bad as a Goodwill. They even have new bed sets that are very affordable. I always go to hit up the neck tie rack. They have lots of good Polyester ties, which is the only kind I wear. Silk is for losers.

I have been going to Bookmans since I think middle school. As far as used CD/DVD/Video Games, this place beats all.  Even though I no longer buy hard copies of CDs, I still go here looking for video games and DVDs for real cheap. They have an awesome selection of everything. I also collect vinyl records and Bookmans has tons of vinyl. My wife likes looking through their huge selection of magazines. They even have toys and stuff that would interest the kids. Oh yeah and the endless amount of books. Reading is not my bag of chips so I know nothing about their book collection. Reading is lame. They also have a 18 yr. + closet for all you perverts out there.

Just had my first Fat Burger last night and I was impressed. I was starving so I got the size above the Fat Burger with bacon and cheese with the Fat fries. It was amazing. The patties were fresh and everything about it was prefect. I don't think that I have had a better burger. The atmosphere is great for being a fast burger joint. Another plus is that they have shallow ketchup cups. I'll never understand why the rest of the world doesn't catch on.

Costa Vida is #1 seed when it comes to burritos. The steak burrito smothered is unbeatable. The place takes a dump on Cafe Rio. The staff is always friendly. The cinnamon tortillas are the best and even though I always feel weird for ordering them cause I think they are for children, but I don't care.  The salads are awesome also. Everything I have had here has been good. The salsas are not salty like Cafe Rio. Everything is fresh, especially the tortillas. If you like a good burrito and have not tried Costa Vida, I don't know what you are doing with your life. Get with it, damn.

There is no better pizza in Arizona than Grimaldi's. I have never had anything bad here. We always get pepperoni, mushrooms and Ricotta. The caprese salad  is sooooo good. The cheesecake is awesome, even better than Cheesecake Factory. The service here can suck sometimes though. If you don't order a bunch of wine or booze, the wait staff puts you on low priority, which gets annoying. But other than that this place is awesome!

I live down the street and have been going to Joe's Farm Grill since Its been open.  I have never had an item on the menu that wasn't great.   This place is organized, comfortable and very family friendly, with plenty of outside seating. It can be super busy at times but it always worth the wait.  My favorites are:  Pepperoni Pizza or any of their pizzas, Grilled Cheese, Fried zucchini, sweet potato fries or any of their fries. Breakfast is awesome as well. I always get the Monte Cristo fritters with boysenberry syrup. Its worth a drive out there for those that live far way.

I LOL just thinking about some of the cast members and skits that I have seen at Jesterz. The first time I saw Jesterz, I was expecting it to be pretty awkward and honeslty didn't know what to expect. I was blown away how funny it got at times. Good clean funny. We went again soon after the first time but didn't go again for a good 2 years, we went back recently and was kinda worried as the crowd was not as big as past times. Even with a smaller crowd there were tons of LOL moments. Writing about it kinda makes me want to go back.

If someone asked me where is the best place to get stabbed other than in prison. I wouldn't think twice. Fiesta Mall. This place is smelly and ghetto. I basically grew up in this mall and it has tanked within the past 5 years. Although I am glad they are trying to renovate and clean this place up with the new Best Buy and such but It still wont bring me back.

I love The Clubhouse. Its not super tiny like some smaller venues and they tend to book bands that I want to see. The stage is not high and and there is no barrier separating you from the band which is always best. The parking is convenient and you can hit the Circle K right afterward to quench your thirst. My favorite show here was Foxy Shazam, and lets just say that if you have not heard of them you might as well consider yourself a wiener.

Over rated dreck. Its about time we call a spade a spade. Come on people, its a mediocre burger joint with not a lot of options. The fries don't hold heat at all and are good for the first 45 seconds and anytime after that they are basically cold mushy potato chips. The burgers are alright but go to Dairy Queen and get the mushroom swiss burger or the Flame Thrower at DQ if you are looking for a fast burger. Oh yeah, the shakes are foamy crap, the ones I have had were barely chilled and gross. The animal fries my wife gets looks like someone threw up all over a plate of fries. No thanks.

I would go here more often if my wife liked it. I grew up this place. I probably spent $1,000 here just on the Simpsons and Soul Edge arcade games alone. They have an awesome arcade selection. The theaters themselves are fine, they are not stadium seating, they are old skool small seats. The seats are basically like taking a Southwest flight. Kinda small for a person with a larger carriage like myself. But worth the price. I like being able to play a few GOOD arcade games after.  When I was in middle school my friend and I would go see movies and let off stink bombs on one side of the theater and move to the other side and watch people reactions, those were the good times, where you could be a jack ass and not feel bad about it. But I would publicly like to apologize to Tempe Cinemas for my behavior ;)

Breakfast burritos in the morning. Chips Carne Asada for lunch and dinner. This place is awesome, even though it has changed names like 3,000 times. It has always been good. I grew up with this place and would take it over Filiberto's any day. Its worth a stab wound to get one off their breakfast burritos.

Sushi Eye in Motion was only my second sushi experience and I enjoyed it very much. I went with some veteran that knew what they were doing so that helped. They first sat us at the bar thing that had the conveyer belt in front of us but that stressed me out too much so we moved to a table and go a menu :)  I had the shrimp tempura and it was awesome. I let my friends get the actual sushi and I tried theirs. It was great. Way better than my first experience. I would recommend this place. Just not sitting at the conveyer belt. That was the only weird part.

On the list of types of food I like, Mexican is absolutely last. I almost hate it. But after I went to Cantina Laredo, it changed my mind.  The fajitas are the best I have ever tasted. The chips and salsa are awesome.  We didnt get the guacamole, $10 for a dip is a little pricey but whatev. For those who order seafood at a mexican resturant in AZ, you must be out of your minds :) Save yourself and money and just stick to beef, chicken and pork and save your ordering seafood for your vacation to the coast.

The other reviews were kinda lame. Bravi is great and extremely underrated. I have had almost everything on the menu and would get it all again. It is fast and tastes great. The Tuscan tomato soup is seriously one of the best soups I have ever had. My favorites are the Portobello ravioli and the Chicken parmesan. Everyone needs to try this place. Its worth the it, the food is great and its fairly inexpensive.

I know I sound like I am 80yrs old but I love Ruby Tuesday's. I have had BBQ ribs at almost every resaurant that has ribs and shockingly Ruby Tuesdays has the best I have ever had. You probably think I am kidding but Im not. Their mini burgers are also great, the salad bar is simple but good, my wife likes it. Their potato salad is good. I like this location out of all the ones I have been to, is is generic like previous reviewer but good food, which is really important.

I like Red Lobster but not this location. I got some kinda food poisioning from the Shrimp alfredo from the Southern Ave. location. If you wanna know what kind of bathroom experience I had after Red Lobster, just pour yourself a big bowl of Cocoa Pebbles and let it sit for 2 hours and then throw it against the wall.  You then get the sight and sound.

This place is great! The have happy hour from 4pm - 7pm (I think) and most things are half off. The quality is awesome. This is by far my new favorite sushi joint and its right on my way home from work. This place is small and quaint inside and the staff is super nice. They have huge selection of rolls and everything else.

This place is great for a fast pita joint. Its like a Pita Subway, the actually really should rename this place PIta Subway. Cause you order and you go through and tell them what you want on it as you watch through the glass. The ingredients are fresh and its a healthy fast meal. The even have make your own Pita Pizza, which is awesome! This isn't your Pita Jungle or anything but its yum for what it is. This kinda reminds me of that Simpson's episode where they had the Fleeta Pita franchise. Extreme Pita is basically Fleeta Pita :)

If you like douche bag sales people trying to hustle you into buying a $100 detail and wax or file a insurance claim to fix the tiny chip in your window, this is the place for you. This place knows how to make things awkward thats for sure. After you get past the douche sales people its ok. The actual car wash is a normal car wash that you would get anywhere else. The place is confusing and annoying. Just go to a self serve place to save you the hassle.

So I think that I have a tie between my opinion of best Cajun/Creole food in AZ and its between Chez Monieux and Baby Kay's in Phoenix. This place had awesome Boudin balls for appetizers. I love boudin so much! When I lived in Louisiana I ate boudin like it was going out of style. The way I test good Cajun joints is by getting my favorite dish, Crawfish Etouffee and this place has it RIGHT! It was amazing! Go check this place out if you want some authentic cajun food.

This is the first place that I had this kind of tart yogurt. It was weird the first time but after the second time I was hooked. They have great toppings to choose from and most of the time the berries are fresh. I would have given it 5 stars but we happened to go to Hollywood and try the original Pink Berry and it was better than Yogurberry. The staff is really nice and helpful at Yogurberry and it is the best for tart yogurt in AZ that I have found. The only bad thing is that they close at 9pm. And on Friday and Saturday nights there are too many annoying teenyboppers cluttering the place up.

My wife had never gone here until I took her. Me having lived in Florida and Louisiana I love this kinda home cooking that you don't get really anywhere else here in the valley. I LOVE the chicken and dumplings! They are the best. My wife likes the fried shrimp and chicken fried steak. The Mac n' cheese, the Fried Okra and the cheesy potatoes are my favorite sides. Their breakfast puts the boots to any other similar breakfast place. The pancakes are amazing, the bacon is awesome, the waffles are the best.  Plus on top of the amazing food you get to roam the Country Store while you wait or after your meal. Tons of old skool candy treats, and a bunch of stuff you would never buy but is fun to look at :) I love going to Cracker Barrel any time and have never been to a bad one!

I like San Tan Village. Even though I do not go in the summer cause it is to hot. But I guess I dont go anywhere outdoors here in the summer. Anyways I like the selection of stores. Its alot nicer than the other mall options (Superstition Srings, Fiesta Mall. Chandler Mall, etc.). The parking situation is not any worse than any other mall, plus they have parking right in front of most of the stores if you need to hit up a store really quick. The food court has lots of GOOD choices. Another benefit is that they do not have a kiosk every 10 feet with creepy douche bags trying sell their crappy cell phones or lotion. The only annoying part is going on a friday or saturday night when all the supid teenie boppers are out in full force and have no reguard anyone but themselves. But thats the same with most malls.

Ci Ci's is awesome. I use to go all the time when I lived in Louisiana and was stoked to see them here in AZ. For only a few bucks you can stuff your face with mediocre pizza, pasta and salad. Its great, seriously. They have tons of different types of pizza and you can even request a pizza and they will make it for free. They have Mac N' Cheese pizza, taco pizza, white pizza, spinach  pizza and all the regulars. In Louisiana they even has shrimp alfredo pizza every friday. Their cinnamon rolls at the dessert bar are awesome when they are fresh out of the oven. Just humble yourself and go.

Blah. Since they raised their prices I do not go to Sweet Tomatos anymore. You now have to pay $2.50 for a drink plus the $10 for the meal. Its a rip off. The salads are good but anything else is nothing special.

Best deal in Gilbert. They have a deal on the weekdays where you can get 2 full meals for $13.99.  You have a choice of many entrees and side. Its not Outback but its still really good. The rolls are awesome. The service is good.  Free peanuts. Ever since this has been open I havent been back to Texas Roadhouse. Logans is half the price and almost as good. If you are looking for a good dinner for a great deal, check out logans.

Ok so I thought Yougurberry was THAT FIRE of the frozen yogurt community. But not so! Mojo is the best I have had since Pink Berry in Hollywood.   This place is a self serve joint that has a variety of flavors. They have tart flavors and regular. My favorite is the boring plain, but they have a 'cookie' flavor that is like a grey color that taste like a puree of a Oreo Blizzard. It seriously taste amazing.   The decor of this place is really rad. Wood panel walls with orange accents. There is only room for like 4 people to sit in-store. Which sucks when its so F'n cold outside. But we got there during a down time and got  to sit down.

JK is awesome! We were hesitant at first to try this place cause I never looked busy but we are glad we did. JK is not as greasy as your typical chinese joint. This place is very affordable, the wait staff is very attentive and nice. I always get the lemon chicken as my entree. If you order a dinner combo it comes in a crazy rectangular box-plate type deal with your entree, rice, a little salad and crab puffs and a sweet and sour sauce and a spicy mustard in their own little compartments. Its pretty cool. This is by no means gourmet and is pretty much americanized but yummy none the less.

This place is rad! Some friends of ours took us here and I had no clue this type of food existed here in AZ. It was my first time having a Pasty and I got the Philly cheese steak pasty and it was awesome.  We had the peanut butter, banana and jelly pasty for dessert and it blew my mind. How this place has not opened more locations than a few I will never know. I can't wait to go back .

I revoked my wife's dinner picking privledges after she chose this place. This place is clean and means well with the 'organic' and 'green' stuff but that does not make up for the complete lack of quality and flavor in this food. First, they use Boylan soda products that are beyond disgusting. There is a reason that most places use Coke and Pepsi products. My diet cola tasted like the smell of bandaids.  Second, We got the breadsticks with marinara for an appetizer and they were small, hard and flavorless bread brushed slightly with oil.  Thrid, They didn't write our order down and the stuff on our pizza was wrong. The pizza was decent size and the pepperoni was thickly sliced which was nice. But the sauce was bland and tasted like the sauce from Spaghetti-o's. The crust was burnt, so much so that my wife and I were having little sword fights with our crust pieces.  The staff was super nice and everything but they have some serious issues that will keep us from coming back. This place is was overpriced, but i guess someone has to pay for the Prius and Smart Car delivery cars.

Paradise can join the overrated elite. WAY to expensive for a small sandwich and side. I have family members that think this place is the greatest thing since sliced bread and they are freakin crazy. I will never go here for any type of meal, it is a rip off and doesn't taste like anything special. I will ONLY go here for their cookies, which are delicious and the only reason for the second star.

Yogurtland has moved into the #1 spot that I go for tart yogurt. I have basically had every one within a 3 mile radius of my house. We are at a time that you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a frozen yogurt place. Its basically the new gelato. I'm sure a bunch will fizzle out just like gelato joints did  towards the end of the gelato trend. Yogurtland will be the king snake after all is said and done. The self serve, abundance of choices and toppings can't be beat. The plain tart is usually my 'go to' but I have been known to get the Coconut flavor once in a while and it is amazing! It for sure has the best plain tart yogurt in the valley. The only downside is it is swamped with ASU douches that think they invented the place, but thats expected :)  Excited for the Chandler location to open!

I have tried probably every frozen tart yogurt place in the Phx metro area. Swirl It is about equal to Ocean Blue, Yogurtberry, Mojo, Orange Tree. Meaning not very good compared to Yogurtland and Pink Berry (California). I was excited to have a place open up so close, hoping that I wouldn't have to make the trek to Tempe or Scottsdale for Yogurtland. So we tried Swirl It with hopes and the yogurt was crazy dense and Icy which is the opposite of creamy, which makes a good yogurt. I'm a plain tart yogurt kind of guy and that's how I gauge these yogurt places. Once this place can accomplish a tart yogurt that is creamy and tart at the same time like places like Pink Berry and Yogurtland, I will return. But for now I will stick my the Tempe/Scottsdale road trips for Yogurtland.

I legitimately have not had such amazing waffles before. They are not super huge, thick and cake-y like some places that make waffles, which I like. The such a have a great cinnamon/vanilla flavor. The fried chicken has a great flavor. Have had lived in Louisiana for a while, I've missed some really great flavored fried chicken and Lolo's is amazing. The side of corn bread I got was really sweet and a huge portion for only $1 extra. The wait staff on the other had was sub par. It almost seemed like they were short handed. We didn't really have a consistent waitress/waiter which was annoying, just random people coming by bringing us stuff and refilling out drinks. All in all it was great food and worth the drive from Mesa.

I am always nervous going to fancy places like Modern Steak. I am not a fancy guy by nature but I LOVED Modern Steak. Some friends took us there and we were not disappointed. The Atmosphere was so rad, not the typical vibe of a steak joint.  The wait staff was on point, polite and did anything to make us comfortable and happy. I got the Day Boat Scallops, roasted Salsify, Truffled Clementine vinaigrette. The Scallops were so perfectly cooked, I have never had better. The Salsify accented the scallops very well. I don't want to sound like I am gushing but everything was perfect. For dessert we got the chocolate cake skillet type dish with the ice cream on top and it was amazing. I can't wait to try lunch and the Kobe burger, they sound amazing. The only downside was making the trek to the Men's bathroom, which was past the bar area. Having to muscle through a sea of Affliction shirt wearing and gel haired bros. Holding my breath through the slight fog of Axe body spray, was kinda worth it cause the bathrooms were nice :)

I was taken here by a friend and seriously loved it. It was a saturday night so it was stupid busy and lots of annoying people. But I can't hate on the actual pizza or service. I had a pepperoni and black olive slice and it wasn't soggy or anything like other pizza-by-the slice places. The slices are huge. The toppings are fresh and the sauce is good. It made me happy that they put the slices back into the oven once you order it to keep it hot and crispy.  For a quick slice of pizza, this place is yum.

I love Rigitony's. They have good, homemade pastas. They have great lunch specials. Its affordable and fresh. I have not had the pizza. My favorite is the baked spaghetti and meatballs. Fresh and chunky marinara is amazing. I would take this place over most major italian places.

The service at this Barros is great. We have always gotten our food real fast and it is always fresh. The Barros special pizza is the best. The wings are always great. They have TVs going to keep you entertained. I also like how they have a separate kids area so there are not tons of rugrats running around. They also have awesome lunch specials where you can get pizza by the slice and a drink for super cheap.
