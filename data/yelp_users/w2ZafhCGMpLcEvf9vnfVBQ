Horrible customer service!!! Sat in the drive in repair area for over 30 minutes without acknowledgment, only to be told they couldn't assist me. Mind you the store and services bays were near empty, and it was 3 hours before closing. All this for a simple nail in the tire. I'll be having AAA put the spare on in their parking lot and going to Discount Tires, tomorrow.

Late night, sofa cushion cleaning - place is dead (and I thought the dude sleeping inside on a bench was, too). Still trying to figure out if he's washing something, or just took too much fabric softener.   There's a dude that is incessantly sniffling in the corner but I'll let that pass since he's kinda cute and I went a little overboard with the Gain products.   Besides great people watching, the place is fairly clean, everything's in working order, and I'm not dead yet. Will I come back? Probably not anytime soon, but that's because I have a washer and dryer at home. They're just a bit too small in size for my cushion covers.   That being said, my IKEA comforter my come back for a late night wash.
