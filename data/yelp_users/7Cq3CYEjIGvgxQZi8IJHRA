: I really wish there were a nursery that could compete w/ their tree selection.  It became apparent after they planted our three fruit trees a few months ago that they'd injured the apple tree w/ a giant pole they drove through the roots (to keep the trunk straight, they said, unlike the apple tree we'd purchased there the previous year and planted ourselves.  Irony?  We'd chosen that apple, and it was curved when we bought it.  Furthermore, they were only supposed to plant the other two trees.  If we'd have planted the new apple, as planned, it wouldn't be struggling to survive, right now).  More than anything, the experience reminds me to be assertive and complain about terrible service, and to look elsewhere before buying any more trees from these people.  (Edit:  Apple tree died.)

Upon arriving @ Buster's On the Lake, it became immediately clear that our party was underdressed.  Most guests came attired in khakis and button downs at the very least; our part was full of out of town shorts and basketball shirts.    That said, our reservation was honored, no problem, and we were met w/ a minimal amount of disapproving glances.    Sure, they seated us in The Lounge, a darkened bar which it became apparent was the restaurant's haven for the undesirables:        There goes that 30-year-old, hunched over in her walker. Oh, look,      Honey!  An interracial couple wearing somewhat urban attire.  Is it      Halloween?  That couple's teenage daughter didn't dress beyond her     years and OMG TOO MUCH PLASTIC SURGERY OVER THERE!!!  We were there for Thanksgiving and the $28 dollar price tag suggested a fine dining experience.  What one got was a slightly above average cafeteria/bar setting (I kept the half-lukewarm Thanksgiving turkey because it's just so obnoxious to send things back) and a friendly glance from the waitstaff forced to work while half the world was off enjoying time w/ their families.  It could just be that wheelchairs don't fit so nicely into anywhere but The Lounge, but Buster's is still nothing you'd want to drive 45 minutes out of your way for.

Craig and I head off to Yuma, to play in the nearby dunes. On the way, we stop for a bite, here-  Craig discovers a moldy strawberry in the space age salad bar; the future is full of fuzzy fruit. In a hushed tone, I hear a patron tell her waiter that the chicken was "obviously very old." I think nothing of it, and finish my biscuits and gravy. They were brought out specially, despite breakfast's ceasing to be served.  We continue on toward Yuma when the sensation hits hard: I need a bathroom. Fittingly, we stop for gas, and I bless the receptacle w/ affectionate blasts. TMI?  Finally having arrived @ our finally destination, Craigers and I speed off on the ATV. He's worried about reports of a vicious wind, but so far, there's not a sign.  Time passes, we jostle about; the scenery is lovely. We work on my fear of heights.  By the time we finally set up camp, I've got a poop tree. A special place. I visit it often, sometimes bitterly, but always w/ relief.  We spend the evening occasionally together.  The wind picks up around eleven. It's not too chilly, but it is fierce. My side of the tent is abusive and perverse: it slaps me in the face and threatens to smother me while I sleep. Several times in the night I require the comfort of my dearest friend, the poop tree.  It's still windy and terrible when we wake the next day; Craig claims I need Immodium AD.  We head off toward Target.  We head home. I drift into sleep.  Currently, each burp is filled w/ a noxious breeze. I feel like biscuits and gravy have crawled into me and died.  I___ |  It's two or three years later and I still remember the horror.  Makes for a funny story now, but I doubt much has changed.  Avoid at all costs because this places is disgusting.    Thanks for the Space Age food poisoning, guys!

I've been to AZ88 twice, now.  Once, shortly after moving to Phoenix, five years ago.  Once, last week.   The first time, we stopped in for a late lunch w/ another couple.  The place was almost vacant, which afforded us a nice atmosphere for conversation.  I sort of dug the sterile modern decor and the food was okay (I don't remember much about it, but had the bacon/avocado incarnation of the 7353 Club).  Sure, a DJ was playing 6-year-old electropop, but the bill wasn't too devastating and I'd liked that 6-year-old electropop the first time 'round.  The second time, we decided to brave the evening crowd, which was a little snootier and a whole lot larger.  Party of eight was seated w/o a wait, which was nice.  But, we were seated at two tiny round tables they'd pushed together which didn't really afford us the space or intimacy we really needed.    Very much entertained by the scores of people that tripped on a step while coming or going.  Less impressed by the food.    Water chestnuts (wrapped in bacon) were great, but nobody really loved anything else.  Ordered the grilled cheese, which the menu touted as "truly the best grilled cheese you'll ever have."  Should have sent back what came out:  a somewhat squishy cheese goof up, topped w/ the same bacon (?) that earlier had brought meaning and purpose to those water chestnuts, this time a touch undercooked.  Parts of the sandwich were actually wet, presumably from the juice of some unsqueezed tomatoes.  By that time I'd had a few too many beers to care, much.  Bloody Mary was definitely bland.  Most bizarre point of the evening came when the waiter, possibly confused by the cork, tried to serve my single serving Lindemans Lambic Framboise like it was a fine wine, showing off the label and waiting for me to taste before he continued pouring.  I mean, really?  No longer sports the Fletcher Knebel quote ("Smoking is one of the leading causes of statistics.") above the bar, which was quite possibly the most interesting thing about the place, if you don't count the artistically lit bathrooms.

Can't speak for Delux as a bar or social setting, but lunch out on the patio was somewhat mediocre.  Liked the fries (served in a mini-shopping cart) and their accompanying orange concoction, but the burgers were bland.  The outdoor seating area, with its view of the mini-mall parking lot, was less than glamorous.    One redeeming characteristic, aside from the manageable price, was the gazpacho, which was relatively delicious.  Would order, again, but that's about it.  A bit overrated.  Wheelchair friendly on the aforementioned patio, but not so much around the high bar table troughs inside.  *Been here a couple more times and feel like the food is at least dependable, and the attitude is kept at a minimum.  Deserves and extra star or two more than my original review because it's the kind of place that you don't love, but that you can comfortably hang out at for awhile w/ your friends, yapping it up.  Also, open late and full of beers.

This might be okay for young 20-somethings, out to get smashed on $3 Happy Hour beers before heading over to the next mall bar across the parking lot, but it's no good for elderly 30-year-olds, intent on dinner conversation.   If you're satisfied to eat @ one of the bar tables, you're set, but if you're looking for old fashioned floor level seating, good luck.  After a 2 hour wait (and our party had actually arrived before we joined them), we two stepped over to a restaurant where we could actually sit down.    And where we could hear each other w/o having to fight some blaring obnoxious pop music.  Can't comment on the food, because we never got any.  Happy hour beers WERE cheap, but $19 for two Happy Hour Absolut and Red Bulls is highway robbery, if you ask me.   Server was nice enough.  Mildly entertaining watching wasted floozies get flung from the mechanical bull.  Could have done w/o the bloody boxing match on TV.  Wheelchair accessible, but only if you can get one of those aforementioned elusive tables, otherwise you'll be at the perfect height to rest your head on the table while everyone towers above you.  Pretty sure I'm never going back here.  Not really my scene.  Perfect if you want to rev up your man date w/ your bull riding skills before some hot drunken anonymous weekend sex, though.

Okay, it wasn't THAT bad.  As others mention, Counter Girl was a little icy: didn't greet us when we walked in, didn't thank us after our order, didn't ask if we'd like fries w/ that.   Burgers were okay, and came w/ a small, floppy pickle.    Of the 25 or so words illuminated on the somewhat tacky sign that serves as the cramped, modern/minimalist restaurant's only art, warm was the only that could be applied to the main course.  Not lip-smacking, or delicious.  Warm.  Moderate outdoor seating area off to the side.  Wheelchair accessible w/ minimal finagling.  Pricing comparable to the Carl's Jr $6 burger.  Definitely wouldn't recommend it to a friend, but it wasn't the worst place I've ever eaten.

Odd that people rate this more than one star.  I'm no snob when it comes to Goodwill and will sort through moderate amounts of crap to find what I want, but this place sort of exceeds  my expectations of sleaze.  First heard about these clearance-style Goodwill outlets from a traveler while working @ a Goodwill in the mid-West, and couldn't quite believe it.  But here it was: hundreds of people sifting through dozens of bins of unorganized garbage: Broken electronics, glass-free picture frames, stuffed stained dolphins, all useless except for the patient few sloughing through the totally random textiles, stained w/ the urine and sloppy Joe of seasons past.   Former reviewer is right that this is a frightening modern frenzy of impoverished people grasping at a piles and piles of junk, but somewhere deep down inside you hear the call of a young girl child explaining the love she had for her decapitated Barbie doll and the following teenage years in her life when she settled into the idea that her slightly annoying, sexually out-of-control best friend was just someone else's spray painted gold discarded metal curtain rod.  Do not recommend.

Living in North Phoenix, I was stoked to hear about an Ethiopian restaurant closer than Tempe, and I wasn't disappointed.    Ambiance was somewhat dreary (in an awesome way).  Housed in a strip mall, the interior was all plain round tables and clear, glass bathroom blocks.  Seemingly a former bar, as our table was on the dance floor, I daydreamed about the late night hours when it turned into some funky East African night club.  (It doesn't, unfortunately.)  My table mates thought the service was a little slow, but I barely noticed.  So, great if you're having a casual dinner w/ friends, but not necessarily if you want to pick up a really quick bite before the movies.  Food was unexpectedly amazing, although we skipped the meat dishes, in favor of the veggie combo.  Injera was definitely better than elsewhere and the rest seemed a little more flavorful, too. Bill for party of four was insanely low, even w/ a couple of teas and a beer or two (the latter of which usually adds a ridiculous amount, anywhere).  Definitely heading back and hoping it sticks around for awhile, especially in a city where Fox Restaurant Concepts is the disappointing status quo.  Wheelchair friendly, although excepting the restroom, which we didn't try.

Love this place enough to give it 5 Stars despite a slight on again off again language barrier  w/ the gentleman who has always greeted us kindly and seated us at the same table, each of the 6 or 7 times we've been here (a barrier which mostly comes into play when I say HOT and he insists MILD).    Only done the buffet once, but it was affordable and I was pretty surprised at the variety they offered and how well marked it was, especially when it came to vegetarian vs non-vegetarian dishes.    Not sure what everyone is complaining about, re: the service (that goes for my boyfriend, as well).  If you've been to anything other than buffet hour dining, you know the service at Indian restaurants is somewhat relaxed, and this place is no different.  The aforementioned gentleman takes your order and then leaves you to your party.  He's never failed to keep our waters full, and despite making themselves more scarce than traditionally bothersome American servers, he and/or the demure lady (who brings our steamy, delicious food in a timely manner) always have a watchful eye on the dining room.    Only very slightly pricey, one could judge the portions of some things small, I guess, but not the main dishes.  There is always more than half left over, despite that we're two bearded bear-types w/ voracious appetites.  Mango lassi is pretty good.  Food is great.    Wheelchair friendly w/ accessible parking on the east side of the building.   Please keep this place in business.
