Can't say I was impressed by this airport, in the least.   Electrical outlets were virtually non-existent, and I was on a two-hour layover in dire need of some power for my electronics. So, I stalked one of the seats at the "recharge" station until someone moved. I put quotes around "recharge" because only one outlet out of the three in front of my seat actually functioned properly. I would've loved to grab a drink at a bar/restaurant, but none of those had plugs either.   Slot machines are the bane of my existence. I thought the carpet was dingy, there was extremely limited seating, and basically, I'm a spoiled brat.

Eggs, tomatoes, gruyere, lettuce, all on toasted sourdough with accompanying roasted potatoes sounds and looks like the perfect post-party breakfast cure, but on the morning I dined at ZuZu, my eyes were apparently much more ambitious than my stomach.   After not eating ONE bite of my plate, the manager came out to make sure everything was alright. Of course it was, I'm just the idiot that ordered the delicious food and couldn't bring myself to eat it. She offered for me to pick something else out, but at the point, nothing was going to happen for me. Although it might seem weird to review a place where one didn't actually manage to eat anything, I thought the service and the fact that they reached out to make sure everything was okay was worth mentioning.   I did manage to nibble on those potatoes and, man, I'd be tempted to order just a plate of those next time They were greasy enough, and hearty bites full of carbs. I have to take this time to say, our server was very yelly, and I wasn't the only person to notice. It was pretty disturbing to overhear everything each table was ordering, but I know she was just trying to be clear. It was in all honesty, startling every time she opened her mouth. Just plain loud. Despite that, she was really helpful in rearranging some tables and our accommodating our group as it grew throughout the morning.   Can't wait to come back on an empty stomach and indulge here!

Arriving to the front entrance of the Ho, I felt like I was an extra in a Brady Bunch vacation episode. This mid-century modern destination isn't contrived, but I genuinely felt as if I was transported to a different time period, while still maintaining 21st century amenities and luxury.   From the welcome at the front desk to checking out and grabbing my luggage at the valet stand, my entire stay was five stars and I'm already planning my next trip to Scottsdale, just to spend it all at Valley Ho.   Spacious rooms are hard to come by in boutique hotels, but not here. I was spread out all over my king suite with plenty of room to spare. The mood lighting in the bathroom actually persuaded me to take a bath (not normally a bath girl, here), and the lovely smelling toiletries caused me to hoard the little bottles each day so that housekeeping would be sure and replenish my stock (guilty!). The king bed itself was what a traveler's dreams are made of. Ample pillows, fluffy duvet, and a mattress made of clouds.   But oh, that chaise lounge on my balcony overlooking the pool where I posted up with my laptop for a good two hours. Let's just say, if my work sessions weren't mandatory during my trip, no one would have been able to get me to leave my little oasis.

Oh Pattie, you devilish dive bar you. Being bamboozled really does perfectly describe what happens here - thanks to Joi B for help with that key word.   The guy behind the bar was super sweet, and got even sweeter in my eyes when my bar tab at the end of the night was $6! We were all pretty astonished at the low pricing here.   Also, just my two cents, Patties should hire resident drinker Kim as their official spokesperson. Home girl really got the party going for our crew, challenging us in flip cup and keeping us laughing until our sides hurt. I'm not sure I'll ever drink another PBR or play another round of flip cup without thinking of Patties and Kim.   Generally speaking, other bar goers were friendly and chill, minus the one Affliction-clad dude who ultimately was asked to leave after borderline verbally assaulting fellow customers - good call on the staff's part for making him leave!   All in all, ping pong, shuffleboard, a punching game, pool, and lots of good people watching amounted in a memorable night that I immediately regretted as soon as I stepped onto my flight home.

I gotta give it to them, these folks handled a line full of disgruntled airport passengers like pros! At first, I walked right by because the line was incredibly long and I didn't feel like waiting. I quickly discovered that no other food options in my terminal were going to satiate my need for Vitamin G.   The wait went by quickly, and about three minutes after I placed my order and paid, I was presented with two gloriously sizzling slices of pepperoni pizza. I loved the seasoning, someone with a heavy hand had a say in the oregano and garlic sprinkling - amen! Part of me was expecting Pizza Hut style re-heated 'za, but this was cooked to order and so very tasty.   It was shoulder to shoulder while we waited so I was able to hear the know-it-all old man behind me tell the young cashier that they should really rearrange their display so people in line can read the pizza descriptions, and also, they should be larger. That nice young cashier handled him with grace, while I rolled my eyes.

Between my delicious and gigantic omelette, and my fianc√©'s french toast, we had quite a pleasant breakfast surprise while enjoying an extended layover in the Phoenix airport.   I always like having the option of sitting down and eating in a comfy banquette setting as opposed to being shuttled through a cafeteria line then searching for an open space to sit and eat somewhere three terminals away...  The coffee tasted freshly pressed, the service was just attentive enough, and I definitely look forward to spending a meal here again!
