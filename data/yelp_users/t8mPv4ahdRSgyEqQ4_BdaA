Let me start off with something positive. The two gentlemen that helped me this past week were very nice.   Now for the bad...  The past two times I've been to this Subway, they've been out of something. The first time it was tuna and this past week I went in and they were literally out of all the bread! All they had was a few 6 inch pieces of bread left that I could choose from and told me that they had flatbread I could use since I was wanting a foot long. I ended up getting the last two 6" pieces they had left which was a white and wheat bread. To make matters even worse, the door had been left wide open to the storage unit that they keep the bread in to keep it fresh so my bread was a little stale. Next, I get to the vegis and the guy tells me that they are out of a lot of the vegetables! How does that happen, Subway! It was around 7 that I went in so it's not like you were running low because you were about to close! And not only that, but the lids that are supposed to be covering all the vegis, meat, ect. to keep them from going bad were all stacked in the middle of the bar in a huge pile! It's safe to say that I'll be going to the Subway on 24th St. and Baseline from now on.

I've been to RA multiple times but never have we received as great as service as we did tonight. Christy our waitress and she was awesome. Great service and had a spunky personality. When you have a server that is personable and attentive, it always makes your dining experience that much better. Way to go Christy! RA, you have a great server on your hands.

BEST. SANDWICH. EVER. I highly recommend "The Truth" sandwich. I don't think I've ever had a sandwich where when i'm leaving the restaurant, i wish i would've ordered another one to scarf down an hour later. Also, Mary and Gordon are awesome and always welcoming! Way to go, Munch A Mania!!!

This is by far the best fast food restaurant iv'e ever been to. They always prepare your food after you order it so you know its fresh. The staff members are always friendly and consistent with preparing your order correctly. Way to go Fili's!

This is by far the dirtiest gas station I've ever been to. The soft drink area is ALWAYS a total mess. Cups and lids are never stocked and the counter top is always filthy. In fact, the other day I went in there and there was not one Styrofoam cup available for use so me and another customer were looking in the drawers for some. A couple days later, I went in and this time they had cups and lids.. but no straws! I had to then use 2 of the little coffee straws. Another recent instance I had was when I went in to get a few different candy bars and literally, almost every candy bar box was empty. I then asked one of the employees if he had a specific bar in the back and whad'ya know... he did. Just pure laziness! RESTOCK IF YOUR MERCHANDISE IS EMPTY OR GETTING LOW AND AT LEAST CLEAN THE STORE FROM TIME TO TIME. The only reason I didn't give this place a 1 star is because even though the employees are clearly lazy, the two gentlemen that are typically there during the day are very nice.

I've never wrote a review on Yelp but this place is AH-MA-ZING so of course i had to.  Background info: My previous hair stylist completely ruined my hair. Never go to Dolce Salon no matter what level. In my case, the gal was a level 6 so that just proved to me that no matter how many levels Dolce has and how high up your stylist is, they can still completley jack your head up. Back to my story, Three weeks ago, I had gone to Dolce to get a brown faid to light brown Ombre' sort of look and showed her a picture of exactly how i wanted it which was Miley Cyrus' new short ombre hair. My hair was shoulder length and pretty healthy aswell. When she took all the foils out of my hair, i was BLEACH BLONDE and only an inch (if that) of my hair right at the roots were dark brown. So basically it looked like I dyed by hair bleach blonde and havent touched it up in a few months. Even her assistant that was in training was at shock when she was styling my hair after. By this time, my hair was ruined. My ends were flaking off and everytime i took it out of a pony, brushed it or just played with it, it looked as if I was having a glitter party since my ends were flying everywhere. Immediately, I called back for a complimentary redo and was able to get in there 3 days after my first appointment. She ended up putting a toner on it and whada' ya know.. they over tone it so my hair then looked muddy (a darker blond with a green tint) WORST EXPERIENCE EVER especially when you pay $300.00 for all this and got NOTHING out of it besides a horror story.  3 Weeks later..  I found Snapdragon Salon through Yelp and I went and saw JENNY!  1. The cute and dainty gal that stands at the front was so comforting when I called and also really attentive when I came into the salon.  2. All the stylist are smiley and just how friendly they are made me feel like i've been going to Snapdragon for years 3. The owner Kandy is so sweet and is also a hairstylist there as well voted Arizona's best colorist in Allure magazine! She doesnt give you that, "im the owner so im better" sort of vibe at all. Shes extremely layed back and when she was talking to Jenny and me about my "hair game plan" she talked to me like i was one of her girlfriends and was just the sweetest. 4. Not only is it a gorgeous salon, but they arent there for your money. For a butcher of the hair and dye, it was $120 and it was the best results Ive ever had. Their there to make sure you look gorgeous and happy and they arent penny pintchers. 5. Jenny rocks!!! I will forever be a client of hers. She has a funny and outgoing personality. She the perfect gal to go to and have "girl talk". Shes 100% honest with you and tells you exactly whats best for your hair even if its not something you may want to hear and styles with nothing else but pure love!   Jenny ended up staying until 9:30 with me to make sure it looked perfect and she ended up having to cut a good 3 inches off and also had to work with one side of my hair being shorter then the other from my ends falling off and it turned out super adorable and the stuff she put on my hair to correct the color (No chemical dye. I forgot what she called it but its like a color stain and non permanent so it washes out in about 6-8 weeks) looked awesome! No more green hair! Now its darker at the top and faids to golden brown! I was there for 3 hours so clearly you can see she didnt rush and took her time so I walked out looking fab  :)  ABSOLUTELY 100% RECOMMEND SNAPDRAGON!!! My sister, mom and I ALL started going here and we LOVE LOVE LOVE it! Thank You so much Snapdragon!

This place is awesome. They have the best sushi for a reasonable price and the customer service is always great. Every Monday, it's Happy Hour all day which is a huge plus. Also, I'd like to point out that Jay, the gentleman that works behind the sushi bar is amazing! He is the friendliest man and knows how to make the best dynamite roll!

My family and I have been coming here for about a year now and it's by far the best nail salon we've ever been to. I highly recommend Bebe, Lynn and Lillian. They are awesome at both mani and pedis. The girls never rush and they are amazing at designs. I highly recommend making an appointment because they are ALWAYS busy. Also, their customer service is on point. Way to go Pink Polish!

This is by far the worst Panda Express I've ever been to. I've been here a few time and every single time, it takes FOREVER to get the through the drive thru. I've literally sat in the drive thru for 20 minutes waiting to order then another 15 minutes to receive my order. I've ordered the steamed vegis twice and both times they were brown and soggy. Also, the rice always tastes as if it's been sitting out all day. I would not recommend this location to anyone.

I went here for the first time for New Years Eve and it was AMAZING. the customer service is great and the servers were on top of everything. I highly recommend the filet mignon wrapped in bacon. Probably the best steak I've ever had. It is definitely on the pricey side but worth every penny.

My boyfriend and I tried this place for the first time after a family member highly recommended it. Kent was our server and he was awesome! We sat at the bar and the service was quick (which is surprising for a Saturday night) and the food was AMAZING. I felt a little sad as I was coming to the end of eating my Pasty and could've easily ordered another one for myself. Also, I highly recommend the Cornish Meatballs . So A+++ to Cornish Pasty and our server Kent!!

Out of every yogurt place I've ever been to, Yogurtology Glendale is by far the best! If you're looking for quality fro-yo and fresh toppings, this is the place to go. Their staff are some of the best and always quick on their feet when it comes to picking up the topping bar, cleaning and making sure the toppings are filled fresh at all times! Way to go Yogurtology Glendale!

Pita Jungle is by far my favorite restaurant in the Valley. I Love the atmosphere at this location and the servers are always friendly. With that being said, nearly every time my family and I have been here, (at least once a week) the server we have isn't very attentive. The only time we really see our waiter/tres is when we order and receive our food. Any time in between that, they pretty much peace out. We do continue to come back though because the food is always amazing and even though the service is not always the best, it's the friendly smile on their face that counts!

First time I've ever gotten a spray tan that didn't blotch when fading and lasted nearly 2 weeks. Also, the color was beautiful! Not a bit tint of orange.

I went here tonight to see my gal for a spray tan because she was doing the art event with Dermalogica. One of the pretty ladies there by the name of Amy had looked at my skin and asked me some questions regarding my current skin routine, ect. She showed me some of their products and was very knowledgable and thorough on how to best take care of my skin. I was only there to get my spray tan since I've never used their products but it's safe to say that I'll be back in their store to try them out. Thank You, Amy!

Brittany did my hair and I love love love it. I had been growing an old balayage out for 2 years so some of my ends lifted a little different than the rest of my hair and Brittany made sure that every stand of my hair was basically perfect. Picky, I like it! Out of all the years and stylists I've been to, I've never loved my hair so much. Highly recommend!!

Tonight my boyfriend locked himself out of the house and Tom was prompt to return his phone call and get to the house ASAP. He changed the lock in no time and was very pleasant to work with. Thanks, Tom!

Tonight was my first time going to Jayd and I'm so happy I listened to my fellow Yelpers and their reviews. When spring hits, I'm all over getting spray tans frequently. She is one of, if not the best beautician I've been to. She took her time to make sure everything was even, dry and natural looking. She was also very friendly and thorough as to how I should take care of my tan throughout the week. I will most definitely be using her as my "go to" gal from now on. Thanks again, Jayd!

First time having crawfish and this place did not disappoint! I was also really pleasantly surprised by how cheap it was since we had a good amount of crawfish and a few sides. Will definitely be back!!

The food here is always awesome but my review is regarding the service that was provided. We came on a Sunday morning so of course, it was busy. The hostess told me it would be about 20-25 minutes but we only waited for 5 mintues which was a great. When we sat down, our awesome waitress, Kylie, took our order. Kylie was nothing short of a great person in general but also the best waitress we've ever had. She was ontop of everything and had a great personality. My family and i agreed that we will now always request her as our waitress! So to the manager of Snooze, you should definitely offer a life time supply of pinnaple pancakes and a beer on the house for Kylie for her exceptional service!

I don't know what some of the negative reviews are about because this place is nothing short of delicious. I've been here once for dinner and today for lunch. Both times I've came here, we had Marissa as our waitress and she awesome. As for the food, YUMMY. Highly recommend the green chile burger and the steak for dinner. Today I brought my whole family and they all agreed that it's their new favorite spot!
