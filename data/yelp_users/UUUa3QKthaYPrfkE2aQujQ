Hadn't been before but my fiance has been going for ages.  I had the coconut shrimp, very good and moderately priced.  Very friendly service.  It'll definitely be a place I consider in the future, especially if I'm using the light rail in the central Phoenix area.

My wife and her family are long term users of Los Olivos and I recently had my first experience with them.  Probably the best car wash I've been to.  Friendly service and they definitely care about doing a good job; we didn't pay for detailing but they ran my car back through the vacuum more then once to get rid of the tons of dog hair.  The owner is obviously hands on and was there overseeing things when we were there.  A locally owned independent biz I'm glad to be able to recommend.

Great place.  Small, good atmosphere.  I'm not a big sushi fan so I ordered a ramen dish (which was good) but I tried some sushi others had and it was probably the best sushi I've ever had.  The "Romance Rolls" were great, as was the Las Vegas Roll.

I hadn't been to Temari in a while but was just as happy as ever at my recent visit. I tried some of my old favorites (Las Vegas roll and Firecracker) and some new ones like the spicy lobster.  Still quite tasty.  For my money the best sushi in the valley.

Good food, beer is even better, nice vibe.  Only problem is parking can get scarce since it's basically in a neighborhood and the line outside can get long.

I wouldn't normally write a review about renting a car but the customer service at this location was great.  I've never had a problem with Enterprise, but this office is always very friendly and a couple times I've gotten a free upgrade.  Just nice to have a good experience even when dealing with little stuff like car rental.

Pretty good.  I've only had Ethiopian once before, but the food was delicious and delivered quickly (we ordered the staples, meat stews on spongy bread).  Reasonable prices also.  They had a log of vegetarian dishes I'd like to try in the future.

Car got hit in a parking lot, Kustom was easy to deal with and did good work.  They had the car clean and all fixed up when they said they would.

One of my favorite places to spend time.  Large coffee shop with seating inside and out, free wifi so I can study or get some work done.  Drinks are good and like the rest of the menu on the high end price-wise without being ridiculous.  This place has been featured on Food Network for their cupcakes and they are indeed delicious.  The menu ranges from breakfast items like burritos and omelets to sandwiches at lunch.  It's usually busy but not chaotic and even the occasional longish lines go fairly quickly.

The best cupcakes I've had.  I'm not huge into the cupcake fad like some, but who doesn't enjoy one every now and again?  This place has delicious cupcakes, and while I usually get one to go they also have pretty good drinks and nice indoor/outdoor seating where you can get some people watching in.  We also ordered a custom cake from them one time and it was a good experience.  Cake was what we wanted, on time and yummy.

We went in about 3:00 for a late lunch/early dinner, and were quite unimpressed.  The music selection was non-stop club, while the flashing lights behind the bar said the same thing.  Didn't mix well with the nice college bar look of the place.  The waiter was brusque.    The food itself was actually ok, I had the pernil burrito and she had the chicken street tacos.  My order was messed up and the food was overpriced, but nothing disastrous as far as the food goes (but nothing special either).  Our check was dropped off when we were literally less than halfway through our meal.  That was fairly indicative of the service throughout; I almost felt bad we were such a bother to the poor waiter.    Overall not worth it.  High prices, food notable only for trying to be ostentatious ("maize granules" instead of saying "corn") and rude, lousy service.  I'd return if they bought me a car or something.

It's a good option for college for some people.  Offers all the academic options/support of the ASU system in a smaller campus that's easy to access if you live in the East Valley.  It's a vibe similar to what I'd think a small liberal arts college would have.  There are an increasing number of amenities including brand new dorms, dining and fitness center on campus.  The area itself is growing and essentially safe but boring suburbs.  If you want to hit Mill Avenue frequently or want to be close to college sporting events go to Tempe.  If you want smaller classes and a more intimate college setting where your professors will all know your name Polytech is a good option.

Went there with a large group on a Friday night.  We were seated after only a few minutes and service was reasonably good throughout the night (the only exception is we asked several times for one of the many nearby TVs to be turned to the Diamondbacks game and they were never able to do it).  Pretzels were soft and fresh.  The caesar salad was fine but unremarkable.  Pizzas were excellent and with abundant toppings.  The pesto pasta was probably the best item I tried.  The beer menu was extensive.  Prices were decent if not great.

The Spot strikes me as the kind of place that belongs in a hip urban neighborhood.  The bikes parked outside with delivery baskets make me even more jealous of the people who live in one of the nearby neighborhoods as they can get eco friendly delivery of tasty food.    The menu tends towards classic favorites with some twists.  My sandwich was delicious; the toppings were clearly fresh.  I didn't try any of the desserts (yay self control!) but they looked delicious.  Like I said, a place like this as a sidewalk cafe in a hip urban area wouldn't be at all out of place.

The only time I've been was for an early lunch on a weekday.  We got there around 11:30, which was fortunate as the location in the Esplanade seemed ideal for holiday shoppers grabbing lunch and the place filled up quickly by the time we finished.  We both had the lunch filet special, a surprisingly robust 6 oz filet with potatoes and delicious asparagus on the side.  The filet was tasty, though not quite what you'd expect out of the formerly nearby Morton's;  I'd say it was pretty close in quality to a cut from the Keg.  And at $19 I think a pretty good value at a nice lunch spot.

Nice little place.  In downtown near light rail.  Has patio dining where you can relax with pho and a cold drink and watch the evening's passerby.  Reasonable but not great prices.  Very friendly service.
