I had a group of 9.  The service was the absolute BEST compared to other places we dined.  The food was amazing and the Manager and our server Carmine took great care of us.  The majority of the table went with the chef's selection.  We all did $50 a head and the food came out.  It was an incredible experience and my palette thanks you.  The decor is hip and the music was to our liking  The sea-bass skewers?  OMG.  Everything was superb.  Only thing was when it was time to wrap up and close the bill.  Took a little longer than expected but still a great experience and we enjoyed our time there.

This is rated the #1 club in the USA for a reason.  Top DJs performing, great lighting effects, stiff drinks and all the bartenders looked pretty.  We had no issues getting in and were front stage when Guetta played.  Some of the crowd can be rude - pushing to get closer.  But all in all, this place is where you want to be.  Even the bathroom was pristine and had traffic control!  The outdoor pool can get crazy.  People jumping in fully clothed in Armani suits.  This is a place where you can NGAF and let loose.  Get a promoter or it will be hard to get in.

The bartender ignored us for the most part.  But eventually we got served. The decor is very nice and there was a dj playing some hip tracks. When our group ordered, the waiter was trying to upsell us hard on dishes (to get a bigger bill because gratuity is included). Someone wanted only a salad but he keep pressuring them to get sides or a pricier entree. The blue cheese/garlic bread they give was interesting. Many diff flavors going on. Kinda weird tasting. I ordered the filet mignon. My steak came over cooked. I like mine medium. I sent it back and they brought back the SAME steak even blacker than before. I called the waiter and he said he misunderstood me. By this time I have not had a meal and my group was finished eating and the wait was on me.  Even with the inconsistencies, I was still billed full price and was never apologized to. I had to ask and point out the issues again to the waiter, and they gave me a free side. Big whoop. Still billed. I was ready to get out. I can't wait to go back to Gordon Ramsey's. Much better overall experience and food.

I was really impressed with the quality of food at this airport restaurant. The service was prompt, the food was well above average an the staff was polite.  The prices are much higher, but it was worth the extra buck. Splitting checks was not an issue and itemized receipt are given. When I am in PHX again and have time, I will stop by again. They have free cookies on the way out so grab one.

Huge portions and home cooked goodness. The wait is long but, you have time. Stick it out and you'll enjoy what they have to offer.  You could share possibly if you want a lighter fare. If man vs food ate here, must be good. Service was good considering how busy the place was.

Shout out to Hayden for the stellar service she provided. Really made our visit memorable. This is a cool place and took my team here for lunch. Prices were good for what they offer. and really cool aviation themed decor. The sandwiches and burgers are good portions and will make anyone happy. The bison burger looks amazing, but I opted for the Rachel (name of an ex too).  Its a twist on the traditional Ruben (not an ex) which I liked much better. Plenty of beers on tap and they have daily specials. We all also ordered flights to try the beers they offer. I really liked the 'Strawberry Bitc*'. Yes Bitc*. And shes good.  Crisp, light and refreshing. If I'm in Goodyear again, I will def come back. Wish we had a place like this in TX.
