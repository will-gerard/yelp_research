Very nice sports facility.   Has multiple softball fields for both softball and kick ball leagues.  Also has batting cages along with sand volleyball courts.

I went in to their location which is right next door to where I moved and ordered a pizza and it was a very tasty pizza.   They even walked it over here to my location which they didn't have to do so great customer service.

We went to Pratt's as I had heard it was a good place to go buy chickens from.   I have to say, it was fun bringing my 4 year old daughter with me as they had quite a few other types of animals to see and she had a blast in the store.   Since this was my first chicken purchase, I was a bit confused on what kind of chickens to buy, but I have to say, that the sales guy was awesome.  I wish I could remember his name as he was very helpful and informative.   I read some of the other reviews on here before posting and noticed a mixture of bad and good.   I didn't experience any of the bad but I know sometimes that comes with the person you work with in the stores..    I will be using them again.

We went in on a Saturday night without reservation and we quickly got seated at the teppanyaki area.   We had to sit there for about 5 minutes before we were tended to, but other than that, the experience was very good.  The chef did a great job and put on a great show with the food prep and cooking.   The waitress was quick to provide refills on drinks.

I haven't been back to this location for probably 2 years as they did a bad job the few times I had gone back then.  I decided to try again today and it is still the same poor quality car wash.    I could probably find some local 10 year olds that would do a better job.   My dashboard had one swipe across so you can see all the dust on the rest of it.  And the exterior still had bugs and stuff still on the front.    They really need to focus on attention to detail.

Great yogurt and great customer service.  We have been here a few times and every time has been a very good experience.  We will continue to make regular visits here.   Even the prices are good

The pizza was great.  I read about the lack if service and we didn't experience that at all.   Service was great.  I look forward to going back again soon

Food is much better and healthier than normal bar food.  I have been here several times and have ordered different meals each time and they have all been terrific.  The service is also very good and friendly.
