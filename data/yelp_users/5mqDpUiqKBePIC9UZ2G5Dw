RAMEN is absolutely AMAZING! Better than santouka, which is supposed to be the best ramen place in California. Can't wait to get me another one!

Very quick and great service! They vacuumed my car, cleaned my windows and checked the fluids in my car which i greatly appreciate cause I don't know anything about cars! I'm definitely getting an oil change here from now on.

Who knew there's a tiny store in Phoenix that sells Japanese goodies??! I love love Japanese food. This place sells ready to eat beef gyudon, sake, frozen gyoza, different sauces (sukiyaki, tempura sauce, katsudon sauce, rice vinegar etc). The lady at the counter was nice too.  I will definitely be back!

I'll start off with saying that i think this place is overrated. I don't know what the big hype is. The coffee is okay, the drinks are okay and the food is mediocre. HOWEVER I still gave it four stars because the service is great and the vibe of this place is just overall good. Great place to hang out with friends.

Delux is our go-to place after hours. I think the best thing about this place is that they are open till 2 am. For those people like me who love "drunk food" but don't want to go to Jack in the Box (LOL), this is the place to be!   Food is always good here. Sushi isn't top notch but it's pretty good. Fish is always fresh. My boyfriend loves the burgers here, especially the turkey burger. I love their lobster bisque which I believe is only available on Fridays. Their fries are good but I don't get the hype. The drinks are good too. I always have the deluxtini while my boyfriend gets the buddha beer.   Prices aren't cheap but aren't too expensive either. Service is good and this place is always busy on the weekends.

The hype is real ladies and gents. The cupcakes from Urban Cookies are amazing. I bought a box of 12 for a dinner party last night, and I was lucky enough to get half off for them as I came during happy hour. I bought a variety of their cupcakes such as their most popular one, brown velvet, and peanut butter and birthday cake. They were so delicious. The frosting was just the right amount of sweetness and totally addicting! The cake itself was so moist and tasted like it just came right out of the oven. Definitely better than sprinkles cupcakes. I have yet to try their cookies and their donuts.

There was some confusion as my friends and I thought that this kabuki is the same as the Kabuki Japanese restaurant at Westgate and Tempe Marketplace.   I started my lunch with a soft shell crab appetizer. Soft shell crab was definitely not worth $8. It was one piece of tiny crab deep fried which came with a dipping sauce that tasted like tempura sauce. I then had a spicy salmon roll which was decent but had a lemon-y flavor that I didn't care for. My friends had a vegas roll which they liked.   Service was great and the place looked very authentic. Unfortunately, I probably wouldn't be back.

I like St. Francis. Everything I've ever ordered here is really good. My boyfriend and I can't get enough of the fingerling potatoes, and the amazing aioli it comes with. I love that they use fresh ingredients that are in season. The corn soup was good as well.    We each had the roast chicken, which I didn't think was anything special. I had the pork chop before which was pretty good, and my boyfriend had the prime hanger steak which he said was just okay. My friends had the baked goat cheese which they said was amazing (you can never go wrong with goat cheese).  I love the ambiance of this place. They have a good selection of wine/cocktails.

I honestly love this restaurant so so much. Their food is always so good. Definitely my favorite sushi place in the valley. I love their poki chips and their seaweed salad as well. My only complaint is the price...they are definitely overpriced and can be stingy with servings. But because i love their food so much, i go here anyway.

I love Snapdragon Salon. Got a haircut recently, and I'm one of those women who always gets the same haircut and likes to keep my hair long (No one ever notices). This is the first time that my friends and family actually noticed my haircut and complimented it immensely! The ladies (junior and senior stylists) framed my face and used the best bumble and bumble products on my hair. I am going back to get my hair colored for the first time and I am ecstatic!

I've always loved the Kabuki in Tempe. I went here for the first time last night for a friend's birthday. The place is clean, nice and classy.   However, while me and my friends were eating edamame, half way through I FOUND A MAGGOT STICKING OUT OF MY EDAMAME. I showed it to one of the waitresses who just kind of smiled and didn't even apologize. The manager came out and explained how they use organic edamame and that sometimes things like this happen. He offered us a complementary dessert which we turned down since we brought a cake for our friend's bday. He then offered to give me (not everybody else) a discount which I said yes to. When we all got our orders, none of us could  eat. My spicy tuna roll tasted like it came from a local grocery store (I was sure it wasn't just the maggot incident).   The manager came back and gave me my sushi for free (My sushi was only $5.50.) He acted like he was doing me a favor. Our server didn't check on us or apologize for the maggot. She didn't really care for our table since she was going to get an automatic 18 % gratuity.  Spend your money someplace else PLS. Go to the Kabuki in Tempe instead. I am never going back to this maggot infested place.

I was contemplating between giving the Mission 3 or 4 stars. I chose to give it 4 stars because I remembered how DELICIOUS the tacos, guacamole and street corn are. Unfortunately, I think all the other dishes I've tried are mediocre.   I had the pork shoulder (Chorizo Porchetta) which the server said was the best on the menu. I didn't like it, as it didn't really mesh well with the chorizo. The pork itself was dry. The beans on the side however, were good. I tried my sister's dish (halibut) which was dry and bland. She had to ask for sauce to give it some taste. I've had the Malbec Braised Shortrib before which I remember was pretty  average as well.   I would definitely be back, because I love the ambiance of this place. It's the perfect spot for drinks/tacos before heading out to old town or for a romantic date. The service is good and I've always had a great experience here.

Great staff, great place. My stylist was Lisa and she did an amazing job. Used groupon too so it wasn't an expensive haircut :)

I live right next to this restaurant. Tried so many times to like it but it's just not for me. This place would be fun for drinks though. It's always busy.

I am not a huge fan of Mexican food so when my sister took me to this restaurant, I was not expecting to me blown away. Except I was! I loved this place, from the beans to the different types of salsa and the to-die for carne asada tacos! My boyfriend had the al pastor burrito which he loved as well. Service was great however my only complaint is that there aren't enough servers. We found ourselves waiting a lot but I knew it wasn't our server's fault. She was just extremely busy.   5/5 stars for sure! :)

Good place. I definitely came in with extremely high expectations, given the rave reviews this place has. The food was definitely good. I ordered the steak with asparagus which i thought was really dry. My sister had the sea bass which was good. Chopped salad was good as well. Crab cakes were meh. I feel like there are better restaurants around. I'd definitely be back, but I wouldn't give this place 5 stars.   Service was very good, atmosphere was perfect for dates.

Ahhh I absolutely love the Arrogant Butcher. I go around Phoenix and Scottsdale and try other restaurants (e.g.: Citizen Public House, St Francis, The Mission etc) but I keep coming back to my first love (The Arrogant Butcher) ;) This is definitely in my top three favorite restaurants of all time, and my favorite American restaurant,no doubt.   Appetizers: I LOVE their cheese and meat plate. The cherry marmalade that comes with it pairs up perfectly with the cheeses and the meat. My favorite cheese are the cypress grove and the prairie breeze (I found both of these at AJs and can't be happier). The Black mussels are my favorite as well. The butterly/garlic sauce it comes with is so so so so good. I could eat it with absolutely anything.  Entrees: I used to order the NY strip but unfortunately, they have gotten rid of it so the next best thing is the grilled ribeye. The succotash and creamy horseradish is what makes this dish AMAZING. My boyfriend always gets the burger which he said is the best burger he has ever had. I've had the jambalaya for lunch before which I thought was just okay, but maybe that's because I was never really a fan of jambalaya.  Dessert: Their award winning salted caramel pudding. Out of this world.   They have a great selection of drinks. I always get the pink drink as I like girly/sweet tasting drinks.  I am getting hungry as I am writing this review. Can't wait to be back here again!

It tastes sooo good! I'm not a big fan of yogurt but this place is way better than most of the yogurt places I've been to. I had a chocolate/vanilla/cookies and cream yogurt with chocolate toppings and super good fudge syrup this afternoon and I can't wait to come back for more :)

Great place. Took my car here last week after my car broke down and Charlie and everyone did a great job. They are good at what they do, and are trustworthy and honest. Will definitely come back.

I love North Italia. The vibe of this restaurant is great, whether you go for dinner or brunch. I'm a huge fan of Arrogant Butcher, which I believe is the same owner as North Italia so the food is somewhat similar. The food isn't as good as Arrogant Butcher, but it's still very delicious. I had the calamari to start, which was okay. For dinner, I had the very delicious steak and potatoes. My boyfriend had the pasta (I have forgotten which one) and he loved it.

Matt's Big Breakfast has got to be one of the best breakfast spots in Arizona. I've been going to Matt's for as long as I can remember, and it never disappoints. I could never get enough of their house fries, which consists of yummy potatoes, onions and rosemary cooked just right. Try their belgian waffle and the specials they have. Oh and prepare for the long wait!

The Gladly has the same owner as Citizen Public House, so there are some similarities between the food and the vibe of both places. The famous chopped salad tastes the same as the chopped salad of Citizen Public House in Scottsdale. This chopped salad is famous for a reason -  it is by far the BEST salad I have ever had. The ingredients just mix so well together and tastes like heaven. If I were to give a review just based on the ambience of this restaurant, the service and their amazing chopped salad, this place would get 5 stars, no doubt.  However, the rest of their food that I have had is just okay. I can name other places that are better, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't come back. I've been here for both lunch and dinner, and both experiences were great. Service is always top notch; the servers know what they're talking about. I had their BLT for lunch which was good, and their sea bass for dinner which my boyfriend and I agreed was a little too dry. The brussels sprouts with corn appetizer was delicious!!

Slowest drive thru ever. Doesn't matter if it's a weekend. They take forever. I've left my place extra early twice so i can get a coffee and then head to work. One time i got to work late and the second time, i was almost late. Dont waste your time - Go to another drive thru.

This is mine and my boyfriend's favorite sushi place. We have dinner here at least once a week. The fish is fresh, the service is amazing and it's affordable. I've tried many many sushi places and this place is definitely in my top 3. The owner/chef is very nice and gives us samples all the time!  Fresh wasabi and the tuna nigiri are amazing.

A year after discovering this place, i love it even more. Juno (the owner) is the sweetest, and so is everyone that works here. Prices are affirdable and the sushi is Impeccable.   My current favorites are the seared salmon nigiri, ahi tower and the omg roll. Harumi also has the best seaweed salad!

Gosh, this place is amazing. I'm a foodie and I've eaten in many restaurants around the valley. Ten is most definitely in my top 3. It's affordable and the food NEVER disappoints. I can eat their shrimp and grit cake and pot roast everyday. Plus service is amazing, and drinks are good.

Delicious and sinfully unhealthy food. But totally worth it! Service was good. I had the chicken skin po boy; just like the other reviews stated, I kind of wished there was chicken meat in it. Still very good though! Prices are on the high side. I can't wait to come back and try their other dishes.

I hate giving a low rating for a place with such excellent service. Everyone that works here seems to love their job so much and it shows. Unfortunately, the food isn't great. I first had the bibimbap a few months ago which I thought was decent; unfortunately I've had better. It was a little bland. I had the calamari as well which was undercooked and was awful. I came back recently and had the hamachi kama with ponzu which was okay.

I love Sushiholic. I'm giving it four stars instead of five because I can name 3 other places that have better sushi but Sushiholic is definitely in my top 5 sushi places of all time.   PRICE: No other sushi place can beat the prices at Sushiholic. I feel like they are on happy hour all day. You can get two sushi rolls for $7 during lunch hours.   FOOD: Their sushi is tasty and the fish is ALWAYS fresh. Their seaweed salad comes in a big bowl and is delicious. Their soft shell crab is good, so are the gyoza, potato wrapped shrimp and shrimp shumai. I am not a fan of the crab wontons, and this dish they have that has fresh tuna on topped of rice and fried together.   SERVICE: Service is always excellent here, from the servers to the owner to the sushi chefs. They are passionate about the restaurant and the food.
