This is one of the best bagel shops in the area!   I am a gym-aholic and go to the LA Fitness that is in the same plaza every morning around 5 or 5:30. Directly from there, I can head over to Lox Stock & Bagel to grab a morning coffee and something to eat if I'm hungry.   Originally, I wasn't sure about it and had never tried it. I would always go to the Starbucks drive thru on my way to work instead of heading there. Then a friend of mine suggested going there (he stops there on his way to work every day). I tried it, and it was a great choice!  There are always about 4 or 5 types of fresh drip coffee to choose from, and plenty of other choices on the menu. TONS of bagels and bialys to choose from, and sandwiches, etc.  Try the Hazelnut Vanilla coffee - it's awesome! Also, the sundried tomato bagel is killer! Get it toasted: it's perfectly crunchy on the outside and chewy (but not heavy) on the inside.  Plus, it's open early enough for me to go there at the crack of dawn! Convenient, really reasonable pricing and great product!

Body Solutions is definitely worth the drive from my condo in Old Town! Even though it's located in a chi-chi neighborhood in North Scottsdale, the prices are totally affordable. I got a deal off www.azspagirls.com that was for a facial, massage and microderm for only $110 (gratuity included). Too hard to resist. The services were all great and the staff was incredibly friendly and professional.   I also tried their "pain free" laser hair removal under my arms. The kicker of the entire visit was that the laser hair removal really and truly didn't hurt at all! I'm hooked now and will definitely be going back for more. It is two weeks after my first visit and my hair on my underarms has hardly grown back at all - and they say it usually takes at least 4-6 treatments to get full results like that. Love this place!   Plus, a drive-through Starbucks is right next door. Enough said, right?

I heard of Elements on Shea through Arizona Spa Girls a while ago but had never been there before. When I was in dire need of a massage last night (around 4:30pm), I decided to call and see if they had any openings at all. When I called they were incredibly professional and kind and were able to fit both me and my boyfriend in for appointments at 7pm. So convenient and helpful!  We arrived a few minutes early to fill out some first-timer paperwork, and were very impressed immediately by the cleanliness and tranquility of this beautiful little shop. We both received 55-min. massages at the introductory $59 rate and were more than relaxed when we left. Definitely one of the best massages I've had in a while!   We'll definitely be back again soon!

SO. Good. And dangerously close to my house.  Yogurtland has some awesome flavors, is always spotlessly clean (they even use those little mini vacuums to clean up the toppings off the counter) and has great service. All of the staff is always super nice to me, especially when I'm embarrassed that it's my second visit in one day.....  The only thing I would change is that they switch up the toppings every once in a while. Maybe some seasonal additions?   Regargless, I'm always scraping my cup clean with my little pink spoon.

LOVE it here! FnB has been highly recommended by quite a few of my friends and it definitely didn't disappoint.   We received excellent service from Pavle, who co-owns the restaurant with the chef, Charleen. We arrived and were welcomed to sit wherever we saw an open spot. We chose the bar - which actually overlooks the kitchen. Great choice!  We were able to watch our food (and everyone else's food) be prepared and banter with the chef about the awesome ingredients.   Although the menu is small, there is plenty for everyone - and they are ALWAYS willing to make whatever you want. I ordered the salmon and my boyfriend ordered the chicken. Both were delicious and perfectly prepared.   Along with an excellent staff, impeccable service and the highest quality ingredients, the drink menu is equally appealing. Be sure to grab some Arizona wine when you go!  Cheers and thanks so much, FnB!

I visited Greenfield Nail Spa today after finding great reviews on Yelp and I could not be happier that I came across it! They have such a friendly and professional staff, and I'm so happy with my manicure and pedicure. Tons of colors in both regular polish and gel and a clean environment. I will definitely be going back!

I'm not the type to complain or be vocal about bad experiences, but I really feel the need to write a review after my very negative experience at Orange Sky last night.   It was early Sunday afternoon and I had called 3 times to make a reservation for the restaurant after hearing great things about it. The first two times my call went directly to a voicemail asking me to leave a message with my desired reservation time and that someone would get back to me. As I was uninterested in leaving a message, I called back again and my call was answered by someone. I made a reservation for two people at 7:45pm that night (Sunday) and we planned on arriving a few minutes early to grab a cocktail in the lounge while the sun was setting.   We arrived quite early (around 6:45pm) and let the hostess know that we were there and would grab a drink while waiting for our table. We mentioned that we'd love to be seated early, if possible, and we were told that "it should be about that time" (7:45pm) when our table would be ready. We understood, since it was Arizona Restaurant Week and we assumed the restaurant was incredibly busy (you aren't able to see the restaurant from the lounge area, so we couldn't tell).   We went to grab a drink at the bar and unfortunately, the bartender either was not behind the bar or had his back to us. After about 15 minutes, we were able to get a drink and have a seat. We relaxed for quite some time and later learned that it was the bartender's first night - understandable, but should have a bit more training as to not ignore customers when there are only about 4 people sitting at the bar. We went to sit outside on a small balcony right off the lounge.  At around 7:40pm, we started to get antsy and went inside to check on our spot and let them know that we had been on the balcony in case they missed us. We told them "we were out on the patio and just wanted to make sure you knew we hadn't left" since no one had said a word to us since we had been there. The hostess' response was, "We're waiting on our servers to catch up. You'd like to sit on the patio?" We replied, "We'd be happy to sit on the restaurant patio, however, we'd like to be seated inside or out - whichever was first available." She replied, "Oh. I'll keep that in mind."  We were confused as to what just happened and thanked her although we felt she was giving us an attitude and sat back down.   At 8:15pm, when we still had not been seated or even approached by the hostess even though our reservation had been 30-minutes prior, we debated just leaving. We agreed that we'd give it 2 more minutes and we would cancel our reservation and head somewhere we knew we'd get good service. Just a moment after that, someone came up to us to tell us that our table was ready. However, we didn't receive an apology or anything. We definitely expected more from a restaurant that was so highly rated.  We were then walked back, through the velvet roped entrance, to the dining room. I must say, the space is absolutely gorgeous. Definitely a winner in the ambiance department. However, we were absolutely stunned when we arrived in the dining room and it was quite empty. There weren't many seated tables at all - which made us disappointed that we waited so long to be seated.... definitely a sign that they were understaffed.  We were seated at a booth inside, and waited for our server. And waited. After about 15 minutes of waiting, our server finally came by to get our drinks. We had decided to take part in the Restaurant Week Menu and were asked to put our entire order - drinks, meal and dessert - in all at once. We obliged, and waited. We weren't served our first course until 9:15pm.   When it arrived, we were definitely underwhelmed. The salmon was over-seasoned and overcooked. The soup was marginal, and the potatoes were hard. One thing that was great was the steak - although it was very small, it was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. Unfortunately, our server didn't come back at all throughout our meal to check on us until we were just about through and she swooped our plate away from us without asking if we were finished.   Also, the women's restroom was dirty and there were paper towels all over the floor. Definitely not something I expected.   For spending over $160 on the meal and drinks for two, the service was unacceptable and the food was just okay. Overall, the experience we had was only a 2 out of 5. And it would be a 1 if the ambiance and view weren't as good.   I hate writing negative reviews, but Orange Sky should make an effort to work on their customer service. Once that is fixed, I'm sure it will be a great spot for a special occasion.

Great local spot with tons of options! Love how fresh the sushi is and a very friendly staff.   We had nigiri, yellowtail love roll, lollipop roll, dynamite roll and the pork gyoza. All so delicious. Can't wait to come back!

Sushi-holic was a great experience for a new restaurant in the Arcadia area! The sushi was fresh and flavorful and service was great. The staff made good recommendations on the menu and the atmosphere is perfect for a casual night out. Definitely coming back!
