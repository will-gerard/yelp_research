Great food but seriously mgt doesn't know the password to the guest access to the Wi-Fi. Really?

Came in for breakfast and the place stinks really bad. Not sure if it's old rag smell, but they need to bleach this place bad. Breakfast was served cold.

Service is so slow every time I come here. But there are no other closer Mexican restaurant near here.

Multiple times I have gone in here and each time they are very rude. I will continue to drive farther to cactus pools just for the better service I get there. And they tried to sell me products my pool didn't need. Shame on you Leslie pools for a lost customer.

Wings were dry and over cooked. One server bartender to over 30 people. Garlic parm sauce was melted butter.  Coleslaw was spoiled. I'll never eat here again. What was good, the beer. Bar rescue where are you? This place needs it.
