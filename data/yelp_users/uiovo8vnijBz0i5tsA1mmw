I'm an admitted Indian food neophyte, so take this review for what it's worth, but I did really enjoy the food at TOI.  Ok, so the server wasn't super "warm and fuzzy" and didn't slap on a ridiculously fake smile the entire time, but he got us what we ordered in a timely manner and was somewhat pleasant about it.    Parking was abundant and the atmosphere was kitschy, but it was clean.  The portions did seem a bit small, but let's face it, Americans are used to wheelbarrow sized portions!  I definitely had enough to eat and it was really good.  I would definitely make a return visit to TOI.

Decided to give this little "mom & pop" place a try when I was seriously craving some Chinese food. The service was great and food was ready quickly.  I was somewhat disappointed at the quality though. I feel like I could have gotten the same food from Panda Express for a lot less money. Will definitely try another place next time I'm craving Chinese.

My husband was a patient of Dr. Garrett's and I recently went in as a new patient.  Jill did an awesome job with my cleaning and was able to get me numb for my crown appointment.  The whole team worked well together and had a seamless flow.  There were no surprises and Dr. Garrett was great!

Our family made a bad decision to grab dinner here and it will not happen again!  Out of four of us, no one finished their meal - they were barely edible.  The chicken and vegetables tasted frozen/thawed/old and the egg rolls were... well, just plain gross.  I usually prefer to write positive reviews, but I just can't for this place.

Dr. Feldman and his staff are really friendly and professional.  The office is nice and comfortable - I get to relax while my son has his appointments and his brother gets to play video games.  We love it!  Everyone is great about answering questions and Dr. Feldman never seems in a rush.

This was quick and convenient.  And..... it was quick and convenient.  I ordered their fish taco plate and ended up biting into what tasted like a salt taco!  Yuck!  I thought it was just one spot on the fish, but my second taco was just as salty.  My friend had a chicken quesadilla that was equally unpleasant.  Unfortunately, the "serve yourself" chips and salsa could not make up for our disappointing entrees.  :(

Tried SaBai for lunch one day and Eric, the owner, was a gracious, wonderful host.  The food was exceptional, service was great and the atmosphere is interesting.  I will definitely return for dinner!

Had a nice happy hour at Windsor.  Parking was a cinch, good food and drink specials for happy hour, attentive & friendly service and a cool atmosphere.  I didn't eat anything, but I will definitely be back to try more that Windsor has to offer!

SAH has taken care of our five dogs for several years now. There are many things we appreciate, such as being able to get in on short notice, the groomers (Nikki is great!), extended hours and nice people. The vets are kind and professional, but I never know who we are going to see, nor could I give you their names. It would be nice to have some consistency with which vet you see, which is the only reason it does not get a five star rating from me.

The food and service at Ann's is great, it just happens to be located in a ghost town! We enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere. Hopefully the secret of Ann's will spread and help breathe some life into their little shopping center.
