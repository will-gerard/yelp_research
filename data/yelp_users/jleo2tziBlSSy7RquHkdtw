WASTE OF MONEY!!! My daughter and I had mani/pedi. After the confusing talk of how much mixed in with all of their up sales prices thrown into the conversation, I was so confused! I wish they would have given more attention to removing the dark polish on my daughters toes before applying the light colored polish she picked. 4 days later my polish is peeling and chipping off so bad that it looks like I need another polish. I WILL NEVER GO BACK! What a rip off!!!

I cant say enough wonderful things. I travel all over the valley for work so having 4 locations has been so convenient. Each office is so friendly and just plan good at what they do. I know I can call Stacey the Medical Assistant, and she calls back with real answers. I can say I have a favorite MA at each office. The front office staff goes above and beyond. I need those special receipts to submit to insurance, I have always left with all the paperwork I need.  I feel like the staff treats you like you were their own family. That is very refreshing these days. I have had the pleasure of being a patient of   Dr. Tutera, Dr. Robinson, Dr. Rhodes and Steve Nunn. I am only 38 years old and after having a partial hysterectomy at 36, my OBGYN said I was fine in the hormone department. I spent the next few years looking for answers and explanations for how I felt. In researching for answers I found Sottopelle!!! Each location has a lab. I am in and out in less time than it took me to drive there for my blood draws. I had extensive laboratory work done which only confirmed I was deficient. I was alarmed at how my main stream OBGYN was not concerned of my symptoms and lab work, but finally I found Doctors who were highly educated and in turn educated me as to the source of my complaints. I have been consistently receiving pellet therapy for over a year now. Every time I just kept getting better and better. My only regret is not finding them sooner. I have a life again. A life with energy, strength, sex drive, my skin glows, my hair loss has improved. Over the summer I was in the ICU with internal bleeding and an infection from a surgery at another Valley hospital. My body was so stressed and traumatized from that experience. You know what helped me out of that health crisis? Sottopelle! I am 100% sure that continuing my hormone replacement therapy helped me to heal faster and once again live a quality life. Thank you Dr. Robinson for saving me with that one. I can go on and on. I would be happy to share with anyone who has questions. I refer my family and friends to Sottopelle, the world would be a happier place if we all had such wonderful care. Much Love
