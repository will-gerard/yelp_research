Horrible ! Not kid friendly the staffers rude honestly. Someone had confirmed my appointment for my. Kids at 9 came in and they said it was at 945 and they didn't say sorry rude no smiles unfriendly !! I would not recommend them I will defiantly transfer to another clinic still isn't he waiting room been here since 840 now it's 10 am .... How joyful I haven't seen the Drs. Yet

Clean place , service is okay just the food comes out to slow and sometimes chefs take off early so you can't get certain dishes on the menu !! Was kind of disappointed

It an okay place to go for pho... Nothing "wow" factor.... They're portions was more noodles and not enough meat... Not to mention very little herbs given

THe staff is friendly and so welcoming ! I've been going to Dr. Garza for a few months since I have found out I was pregnant ! He was amazing he was understanding to all my situation! The staff was sweet and attentive and wasn't annoyed even when I had to have 3 children come into the office since I did t have a babysitter ! I highly recommended Dr. Garza and this clinic !!
