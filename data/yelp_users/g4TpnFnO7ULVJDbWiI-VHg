Isaac is the fucking man. One of the best bar tenders around. I'll be back for sure because of him

Overall amazing experience! Came in and sat down feeling very welcome. Colton the bar tender killed it. Great guy, great conversation, great suggestion, great service. Sake bombs were 3.75 which was a gamechanger and awesome!!! Always have a great time here and would recommend it to everyone.

The girl would not serve my friend in a motorized vehicle in the drive through. Told me she was calling the cops but called a security guard and no justice was had. Rude and mean woman needs to be fired from her job. Worst service ever at a mediocre establishment that just lost all credibility.

Sold me drinks before close and rushed me out. Don't sell me drinks if you are going to be rude and rush me out of your bar
