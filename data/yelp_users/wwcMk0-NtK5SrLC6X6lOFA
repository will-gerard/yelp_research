There are no books but they learn from books.  I would agree this is not the school for everyone but if your child is a tactile learner or needs more physical activity to help their learning, this is the place.  Every year they learn about a period in history for the entire year.  They do delay reading but not for development of the soul.  The brain is not developed enough to do more than memorize before then.  Delaying actually helps them read the whole word...not phonetically learn or memorize the way it looks.  (Wonder why everyone's spelling has devolved?). This is the same as many European schools.  The kids are learning- actually learning- and not just memorizing.  They are also being taught to think.  The school supplies colored pencils and water colors and crayons every year for each child- high quality ones they get to keep.  They teach art, gardening, animal care, cooking, hand work, cursive, Spanish, dancing, PE and music in addition to the traditional subjects.  No school is perfect but this school is a perfect fit for my child.

The books are used. They have bookshelves full of them. The difference is not having a set book for each subject each year. They learn from multiple modalities- I have seen my son do research projects that last for weeks and require looking up information and learning from multiple books, websites, encyclopedias and so on. I have leaned to appreciate that while the method of learning is different from what I see for other schools, I see my child learning to learn- not memorizing from rote alone. He follows the same curriculum the district requires and is learning how to think for himself and form ideas and thoughts.  It's been different but I have learned to really appreciate that this type of education is perfect for my child and has not drummed a love of learning and discovering out of him. He has maintained his joy is learning new information and assimilating it.

My sister and I always go here as did my father when he was alive.  They are always polite and remember our names.  I've taken others as well and they enjoyed it!!

Didn't care for our square fish or the sauce. Both of us ended up feeling and getting sick that night.  I won't be returning.  I don't understand the appeal at all.

My favorite wine bar.  Yummy food and nibbles .....try marinated olives and Brie and apple bruschetta.  Marinated tuna also yummy.  Easy and relaxed atmosphere and heaters outside for winter.  Been going here since they opened.  Unique wines you can't get just anywhere. I like the Crios.

Super awesome service,  cool management,  great wine and bruschetta.  Only lacking 5 stars because the olives were so-so and the music was so loud it ruined the relaxing vibe.  Nice place to hang with friends!

Clean Laundromat, clean bathroom, bright with plenty of carts and helpful staff.  Worth going to when your washer breaks!  I've come back to wash king-sized bedding.  Bring your laptop or ipad.

If I could give 1/2 star, I would.  Service stinks and they get the order wrong in the drive-through 75% of the time.  When you drive back to get the correct items, they act rudely and put out.  I drive out of my way to go to a different one now.

Yummy kale, marinated garbanzos, poblano dressing----can't say enough.  Loved all the different textures and flavors.  My coworkers had salad envy.  I will be coming back!

My friend and I very much enjoyed our lunch here.  I had chicken, udon noodles, Dan Dan style.  My friend had chicken, rice and sweet Mongolian. She has a smaller appetite and finished every bite.  My son had orange chicken and did not enjoy it and they forgot his juice box but otherwise a good experience.  It was very clean when we were there and the bathroom was clean as well.  It may not be authentic but it was yummy!
