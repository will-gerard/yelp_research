3.5 stars, and this is simply a review of the surface, the price, and the crowds.  for starters: i remember a wooden floor back in the 80's, i believe it was called Rollerland, over on McDowell? and 23rd avenue. i guess Skateland, et al, all you can find is epoxy-coated concrete.  so, after growing up skating and giving it up for other hobbies around 16, i finally have a Wiff and Chiddrens. we went on a saturday and got some rental skates, had the birthday pizza and snacks, got back into the groove.  immediately got better skates for the four of us. so sunday, evening... not a big crowd. lots of kids to be sure, but easily maneuverable. music is modern top forties, i guess. kid stuff.  sunday, btw, is 1 dollar skating. you just cannot beat that.   they do a backwards skate, a couples skate, a couple of games like Red Light/Green Light (for free tickets, etc.) and the Hokey Pokey w/ Spongebob or the Frozen guy Olaf.   somehow my son of 8 seemed to be hitting a lucky streak as he had zero tokens for the games, found one on the floor and turned it into 64 tickets.   my daughter of 6 stayed out on the floor for about 3 hours, learning her moves. the walker/skate mate is a thing of the past.   overall, it's a skating rink. if you come here for the food, you have poor taste. the bathrooms are small but were clean, there is a drinking fountain, the rental skates are true to size as far as i can tell.   i'd like to return for Adult night, maybe they play some modern rock, and let you get up to speed. if that happens soon, i'll update this review.

the local north mesa restaurant. after 5, prepare for a wait.. daily. happy hour and a small but ok variety of craft beer and mixers, wine of course. bar is crowded usually, service is fast, staff is friendly, a nice place to take the family. i have been at least 5 times, and won't discourage you from going. fare is decent, specials keep it interesting. fun to watch the kitchen in rush hour. nice, open, friendly, and carries local craft beer. 4 stars!

if it weren't for the decent beer selection, (second visit here and i had S.T. Count Hopula and Stone Smoked [vanilla] Porter) this place would get 1 star.  We had dang near the worst service in all the 32 years i have lived in Phx. being that there were only 2 other customers besides our party, on a Saturday @ lunch hour, the service was unacceptable. all the time it took and hassle from the kitchen about fish and chips resulted in a $13 plate of food that was worth about $4. I would have seriously considered a Big Mac if foresight were applicable.. it was that bad.   anyway, stop in to quaff a beer if you're on the way to another spot, but dont come here with the exclusive intention of having a good time. chances are, it will elude you.  as one reviewer claimed, there are better English Pubs in BF Egypt. He could very well be right.

train wreck.  fifth time here, only once was good.  after giving my hungry kid's orange chicken to the wrong table, we finally get our rolls. decent enough, we've had them before.  waiter comes back to ask if we are still hungry, and is there is anything else he can order for us. YEA... how about the sashimi platter we ordered!!!?  he apologizes and 17 minutes later we finally get the 16 pc sashimi plate.. the yellowtail and bigeye tuna was disgusting.. 5 days old i would assume.   2 visits out of 5 were ok. for me, i wont spend my dollar on a 2 star restaraunt. we're done here. next.  Go to Got SUSHI if you are at this intersection.

This is my first (liberally given) 5-star rating.  A clean, organized, stocked store.  The crew will help you choose any style they have capacity to brew, and if they are out of a pre-made kit, they will assemble it in a hurry. Sure, you can mill your own grains but having Jacob do it while I wait is satisfactory, in the sense that I know they are willing to help without hesitation. *unlike service i have gotten from the 'other' place.  they have a little basket of toys so the kids are kept occupied while i shop. a nice touch, and if you have toddlers you'll "get it".   this store is worthy of a visit, even if you live in Tempe. a gem, i'll be returning here time and again.   - mike s.

We spent most of Friday evening with a party of 14. Mario and his team have a great spot here. DeRuvo doesnt dissapoint! We had a variety of dishes, appetizers, dessert and everything in between - all in a non-assuming, down home feeling place. Just the craft beer list alone is worth your visit. You don't find many Scottsdale gems with such taste.. the menu also changes weekly... the sign of a fantastic restaurant. Get in here!

only been twice, dining in. standard pita gyro, the meat was tender, with just enough spring to make a delicious and savory bite. the hummus is house-made and it is very smooth, not grainy or oily. just perfect consistency. flatbread served hot, delicate, like a good pizza crust just chewy and crunchy enough.  wish i could add more menu items for this review, the tahini sauce was perfect. the staff (appears to be original, family owned, super friendly) treats you like family. it's a nice touch. one of the advantages of this intersection is there are several family owned businesses.. and i like to support them. ace hardware.. alyssia's... iowa cafe.. pita island. skip applebee's - hit this spot NOW!
