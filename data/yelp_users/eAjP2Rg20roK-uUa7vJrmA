DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! I was having a problem with my garage door openers not working to open the garage door. The garage door, itself, worked just fine using the wall opener. There weren't any other problems with my door. They came to fix the door & now it will not open or shut. It also has a huge dent in the top of the door. The technician left with the garage not completely shut & now a non-working garage door! They lied to my home warranty company saying it was already broken before they came. I opened the garage door for him to work on it! So, how could it not have been working?   I'm only giving one star because zero stars are not an option.

So, I have been to this Pita Jungle many, many, (did I say many?) times before.. Never have I had such poor customer service or been treated like my patronage didn't matter.   I called in an order to pick up. You would think that ordering that way wouldn't require much in the way of customer service. Right? Well, apparently, this staff didn't think it deserves any.   I'm pretty sure the "manager" was one of the people I came across during this trip to Pita Jungle. I won't be coming back after today.   Upon arriving, no one was at the front of the restaurant to greet the other customers waiting or me. No problem. I was just picking up food anyway, so I went back to pick it up. Another customer arrived before me & another right behind me.   No one greeted us or came to deliver our food for over 20 minutes (and that was just the beginning). Then, a waitress came up & asked what I had after another waiter asked the first customer what she had. He just disappeared after that & I never saw him come back with her food or ring her up.   The waitress couldn't find my order & said she would ask another server if he had it. (Meanwhile, the manager had been sitting at a table talking to someone this ENTIRE time). He was facing the to go line & never asked someone to help us or made an effort to help us or any of the groups of people who came in & kept waiting to be seated.   Finally, the manager ended his long conversation & curtly asked what I had. I, once again, stated my order that was now placed over 30 minutes prior to this time. I told him that if the order wasn't already entered I would rather just leave, since I had been waiting so long already. He went to go check on it. I looked over at the place the order comes up & my order was already there when the manager went over to check. So, I decided to wait since it was already up.   However, the manager came back & told me my order was coming up. (I saw it was just sitting there, so I wondered why he didn't just bring it with him when he walked back over to us. Instead, he brought a customer's food (who just arrived). He rang him up. Then he took the order of the person who had been in line behind me & rang him up.   In the meantime, it had been 36 minutes since I called in my order. Due to the attitude of the manager & his clear lack of customer service, I finally just left without my food. Who knows when he would finally bring me my food & it had been sitting out on the counter for over 15 minutes without being refrigerated or anything. That's how people get food poisoning. It had chicken in it.   I've NEVER, EVER left a restaurant without my food before. This was the worst customer service I have received at this restaurant & pretty much anywhere. The food isn't that good to go through all of this hassle. I won't be back. I can promise you that.

I rarely eat burgers since they are known to counteract my workouts at the gym. Lol. But I won't even bother eating one from anywhere but Lobby's! When I get a craving for one, it is the only place I will go and/or recommend to my friends! So delicious!!!

I appreciated the courtesy, professionalism & customer service of this company. They personally took my call to schedule the appointment. They described their product used and how it works. They agreed to avoid my garden. They advised me of where the discovered 14 scorpions using their black light (and they explained the high season for scorpions is June & July, so this was a lot of scorpions)!   Their prices are reasonable for their excellent service, their proven results (14 scorpions & that is just the ones they saw that they killed, not the ones the product will continue to kill), and their availability.   I will definitely be using them again and recommending them to my friends and family!!

From the moment we walked in, the hostess was really ditzy. After asking a few questions, she became really rude. She was snotty in the way you see teenagers smart off to adults. Shortly after that, she started chatting with another hostess & they both were behind the hostess desk glancing over at our party while they were talking.   It is unnerving how terrible their customer service was. After that incident, the meal was ruined & an utter waste of money. I will NEVER be back. Too bad too, since my friends have all been talking about trying it. After our experience, I'm pretty sure they will skip this place. There is so much competition, that bad service just gets you banned.
