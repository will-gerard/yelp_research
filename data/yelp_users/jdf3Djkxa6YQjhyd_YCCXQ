Found Framin Works on Yelp. and was not disappointed. I had a very large picture that needed framing. In the past, I had gone the easy route, and gone to Michaels for all my framing needs. The picture I had was so large that I decided to call them with the dimensions of the picture and tell them what I was looking to have done. The lowest prices they quoted me was almost $400, and that was with a 60%+20% off coupon!!! i decided to try Framin works, and saved over $100 off the lowest price that Michael's had quoted me. Granted, this price included a 25% off coupon, but I still thought the price was very fair. When I brought the picture in, the owner was very fair and didn't try to oversell me. He actually, told me that all I really needed for the picture was a new frame. He said the glass was fine, and that matting was in pretty good shape. I ended up replacing the matting and the frame. The finished product was great. I will definitely be back!

Five years ago, my husband and I moved to Phoenix. We needed to find a new vet for our cats, and did not know a soul. So, I turned to the internet and chose one based on Yelp reviews. That's how I ended up at Blue Cross Veterinary Clinic.  Blue Cross is about twenty minutes from my house, without traffic (I live in Laveen). Sure, there more than a few vets between my house and Blue Cross, but I have never felt like looking for a new vets. That is really saying a lot, because we have three cats. Cats do not like car rides, especially long ones!! Still, I love the care my babies get from all the doctors and staff there. I have nothing but an awesome experience with ever doctor there, but Dr. Mulla is my favorite. Like I already mentioned, all the doctors there are great and caring, but something about Dr. Mulla really puts me at ease. I adore my fur babies and would not want to take them anywhere else.

We went to Spinato's tonight for dinner. I really can't say enough good things about the food and service. I am from Indiana. There is a pizza place in Indiana and Illinois called Aurelio's. The pizza there is superb. Apparently, Mr. Spinato and Mr. Aurelio worked together in the pizza business, and opened the first Spinato's in AZ together. My mother is visiting from Indiana, and I wanted to taste pizza that reminded her of home. She loved it. We all loved. My mother and I split a medium pizza. My half was Mama Spinato's signature fresh spinach and hers was the Chicago. My husband had a medium Nicole's new favorite. All of the pizza was amazing. Before dinner In ordered a dinner salad. I figured it would keep me from devouring my whole pizza. The salad was also really good. Throughout our meal, our server, Madison stopped by frequently to ask how things were and to see if we needed anything. She was the best waitress we have had in a long time. All in all, it was a great experience. We will definitely be back!

The food is okay, but the margaritas, and chips and salsa are awesome. Besides this, I really love atmosphere. The outdoor bar and bocce ball court create a cool and inviting feeling.

By far this one of my favorite places. My husband and I go there every chance we get. The gelato always tastes amazing. Everytime we go there, there are new delicious flavors. There is one negative, the gelato cakes. We have purchased two of them, and were disappointed both times. Unfortunately,the cakes are mostly cake with very little gelato. But overall, I can't say enough good things about this place!

After reading all the fantastic reviews on yelp, my husband and I to go to Tarbells to celebrate our first anniversary. We had made reservations, and were seated right away. The service was as good as it gets. And the food, was amazing. My husband ordered salmon, and I had the pan roasted chicken. Both were amazing. I never knew chicken could taste so good. For dessert, we split a piece of warm chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream.  When the dessert arrived, "Happy Anniversay" had been written across the rim of the plate, in chocolate. It was such a nice touch. Overall it was a fantastic dinner at a reasonable price. We will definitely go back to Tarbells.

Based on all the great reviews on Yelp, I decided to give the salon a try. I was getting married in 2 months, and hadn't had anything done to my hair in over 6 months. I knew I had to get the ball rolling, if I was going to have my hair looking good by wedding. I made the appointment for 2 weeks before my bridal shower. I told the stylist I didn't want to go to overboard, but had always like my hair in a shade of red. When she finished my hair, I was in shock. It looked horrible. It was bright red, like Ronald McDonald in the front and lighter in the back. It was NOTHING like she had described it beforehand. I know I should've complained and asked for her to fix it, but I didn't have a lot of confidence at that point. I had to wait 2 weeks, to get my hair fixed at another salon, which ended up costing me quite a bit, if you factor in the $160 I paid for the crappy do, and the $100+ I paid to have it fixed! During those 2 weeks I had to wait to fix my hair I have never had so many people ask me what I had "done" to my hair, and not in a complimentary way! I would never go back!

I can't say enough good things about this place. My husband and I absolutely love Scooptacular. This local business has awesome ice cream. My personal favorites are Oatmeal Cookie and Laveen concrete, but really all their flavors are delicious. They are always coming up with new flavors. I recently purchased 2 birthday cakes from there, one was Rocky Road and the other was Oatmeal Cookie. Wow! The cakes were absolutely the best combination of cake and ice cream I have ever encountered, We have also purchased the Laveen concrete in a take-home gallon. When we purchased it we were told that we can have any of their flavors in a gallon, if we give them advance notice. They also told us that we can create our own flavors in a gallon, using their various toppings or bringing in our own. I also really love the fact that owners are local people who really give back to their community. I truly feel lucky to have this gem in my neighborhood.
