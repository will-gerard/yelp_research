Stopped here after a Group-On promo. The person at the register, like many of the reviews below, was not the friendliest in the world but then I came here for BBQ and not to make a new friend.   Ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs, hot link on the side and cole slaw and potato salad. The ribs truthfully were very good, some of the best I have had in a long time. The BBQ sauce was also excellent but more of a mid-west style and tasty.   I cannot say how the hot link was because they shorted me on this! Sorry but ordering something then paying for it and finding it missing once you get home just is not right. Really gave me a bad taste in my mouth over the place...   I have one more Group-On voucher and am using it this week. This time eating inside so lets see if they short me on anything else this time...  ~~~~~~~~ UPDATE! Returned to Honey Bears on Friday and first off the person working the register was a lot nicer to work with. Also mentioned that I had been shorted a hot link and she took care of it, giving me an extra one today.   Had the ribs again and once again they were excellent. Also got a BBQ Beef sandwich to go for lunch the next day and it was very good as well.   Course when I was at the restaurant this time the soda fountain stopped working and as usual it was AFTER several of us had paid for drinks. Oh well...

Have taken several television sets into this shop and every time I have gone there they have been wonderful! Have used them for 5-7 years and they have been able to fix everything, even an old tube type radio!   Its hard to find places like this that actually repair things, with people this nice these days! I do not even think about going to any other shop these days.

I have used these two brothers for years and will never go elsewhere.   They do most anything from shoe repair to making things for house and home on the sewing machine. Even do leather and fabric repair and so on. Not to mention that they replace the batteries in my watches, so all around repairs here.   Cannot recommend them highly enough, they do a great job!

Have been going here on and off for about two years now. Very nice people working here and they do a good job. Was a "walk in" and they took care of me right away. Ivy did a very nice job and will return!

One of the best we have found in Phoenix. Their ribs are excellent, hot links good (could be a bit spicier) and brisket very good. They even have BBQ lamb, which a few of my friends love.   I go there every time I am in the area. They used to have a location on the West side of town but the landlord got greedy and raised the rent too high, so the one East of the Airport is the only one... for now! Going there for lunch today!

Just went there today after calling yesterday and confirming that they had the parts I needed.   Really nice folks (Jasmine and Bob helped me), the place was clean, parts looked nice, not all dirty or greasy, and just a good experience.   If you need parts that are hard to find, give them a try!

Have been going here for 4-5 years now and never had a meal that was not excellent. I used to have the BBQ but lately have been having the Italian Beef sandwich, which is also very good. Only issue is that sometimes they put too much sauce on it and the bread falls apart so I get it dry and dip it in the sauce myself.  Curly fries are great but the serving is too big for me (wish they would sell a 1/2 serving which is still enough for 2 people. Their regular fries are also very good.   Michele does an excellent job here and you will be happy with just about anything!

Went back for lunch yesterday. As usual loved the fries and the Italian beef was so good that I took one "to go" for tomorrow. This time they had home made potato chips and they were great!  Food is great and staff is excellent... thats  why I keep going back!

Called them looking for some equipment and they had it on hand (other place in town ordered it then dropped the ball) and held it for me. Stopped by the next morning and they saved the day!  Very nice and friendly, will be using them again!

Second time there, they overhauled my last pool pump motor. It lasted "only" 10 years!  Back yesterday and they were as nice as possible, and showed me how this time the pump element and impeller needed replacing.   Sure enough got the new motor back home and with the replacement pump parts the cleaner runs almost twice as fast.   Excellent folks to deal with, will return!!

Have been going here for years and usually eat here at least once a month.   The airplane views are great and the food is above average. There is a good reason its packed for b-fast and lunch, and thats because everyone likes it here!   Give it a try for yourself and see! Oh yea, the french dip is great as are the Greek foods!

Was there this past Tuesday. Lets just say that the manager was extremely unprofessional and until things change I will not be returning.

Have been here several times over the years and its just gotten better.   Service was wonderful and after spending a bit of time with some friends had an excellent burger while my friends had some taco's and such. Everything tasted excellent and had a great time.  While we were there a group got together and were playing volleyball and had fun watching them. They also have live music on the weekends!   All in all had a great time and will return!

Will never go here again! Was at their Phoenix Broadway location on Friday and the manager there called the manager of this location inquiring about a specific type of car. Manager in Mesa said that they had the car and to come on over and grab the parts I needed.  I left and drove direct from the Phoenix yard and 15 miles later arrived at this location. They told me to "look in row ##" and so I walked out in the yard. 20 wasted minutes later in 106 degree heat I returned inside and asked again where the car was located? Cooled off for a bit and finally talked with someone else at the front desk and she said "wait a minute while she looked at a list".... then told me "oh we just crushed that car a few minutes ago!!!"   Excuse me? We just called from the other location, manager to manager... and they knew I was coming over but guess they do not give a chit about customers and just crushed it anyways while I was standing there... .   Returned to the Broadway location today and ran into the manager there and he told me that he was perturbed at the Mesa manager and had called her after he heard of what happened to me. She got mad at HIM for questioning her actions! Guess she does not care about customers... they get in her way and ask silly questions.   Sorry folks, please go to the Pick A Part over on Broadway street and you will find a great bunch of guys working there who do an excellent job of helping you. The people working here do not care about you, only about your $$. You can do better...

Stopped by their yard two days ago and looked around. Am restoring a 1970's car and looking for parts.   Went back inside and talked with the manager and he said to look at their yard in Mesa, and I did. What a nightmare (will review that location separately) and will never return to that location.  Returned to the Phoenix location and as before the staff were very nice to work with and bent over backwards to help. Found the parts I needed and they even noticed that I was pretty hot and tired when walking back and gave me a water and soda for free.   Excellent guys to work with and they haggled on the prices so am happy. Will be returning here again!

Have gone here for years and always enjoyed the food. Unfortunately tonight was not going to happen as someone at the restaurant decided to park not only a storage container blocking off parking spots in the back lot, but THEN an entire flipping SEMI-TRUCK with trailer that blocked off a good 8-9 parking spots.   No way to find a place to park, customers were driving in the parking lot, looking then leaving. Sad to say I was one of those. The food is IMHO great but if you cannot get a place to park you cannot eat. I may be back but not sure when....

Really nice folks and an excellent view, you get to enjoy a very good meal with airplanes flying around! What more could you ask! We eat there almost every time we fly into Henderson. As well when we stay overnight we drive to the airport and have breakfast there!   Best to call for times, as I believe that they close at 4 pm on some days.

If you are in the mood for their fish, shrimp or chicken, this is one of the best locations I have found.   Very nice and friendly staff, they do an excellent job and take care of people here. Also have signed up for the text messages and that gets you freebies, which makes it even better!

Have had Love help me with my pool for the last 10 days and very happy with their service. They were on time for every appt and Andrew did a very good job letting me know what was needed to get my pool back in shape.   He then returned yesterday (on time once again) and acid and chlorine washed the pool. The turned a fair looking pool to one that now looks like new and had taken care of the algae issue that I had.   The price was very fair, they did the work on time and as promised and are coming out on Friday and probably once more to make sure everything is still working fine. Could not recommend them more.

Been going here for about 6 months now and was not real excited at first but the food kept getting better.   Try the brisket plate or pork sandwich, am sure you will be pleased!  Also they have "Prime Rib Fridays" and its very good as well!   Also they have a LARGE room in back for groups or extra people and a big screen TV for games and such!

Had a great time yesterday with Desert Wolf Tours!   Zev was as usual great and had a excellent time with him!  Then Lowell took us on the tour of the desert in the Tomcar's and we had a great time. Lots of fun in areas that you normally see only on horse or motorcycle, these buggies will take you almost anywhere. Plus some good tips on desert landscape and life out here in the desert! Highly recommended for everyone!

Pls be very careful before you use this store, especially on gun transfers. Friend of mine has had a gun damaged AT THE STORE and they finally admitted it after much "shuffling of their feet and not looking the owner in the face."   Then after agreeing to pay for the repairs are now saying "you have no proof of what happened" of all things and waffling on what they initially agreed to do!   Used to be an excellent place to work with but not any more. Hey Clint, pls prove all of us wrong and do the right thing!

Been going here for years now. Ray and Gage are a really big help and make shopping here easy. Almost at every turn there is something to look at and so far I have not gone there and come out empty handed.   Also the new Mesa store is very nice as well. It feels different but also nice.   You can dicker with them on price if its over $25 or if its broken or does not work.   Now for the not so good... until they get some fans or swamp coolers in the building, so EARLY as the A/C does not work. They need to work on this, otherwise love the place!  EDIT on 12 June. Went to the Mesa store again and they had Air Conditioning this time! Glad to see it and they will really increase their sales with this!

Just had dinner here on Friday night and loved it. I had the Pho, chicken and shrimp and friend had the rib-eye. The Pho was excellent and the rib-eye as good as I can do at home.   We also had the shrimp appetizers and they were great! Will be going back!

Just took my truck over to Impact Diesel and found a group of really nice and knowledgeable folks. They do all sorts of repair and modifications to trucks and were very nice and easy to work with.   They took care of all of my issues and repairs to the vehicle and a week later am very happy with the work they did. Highly recommend them!

Stopped by to try a new BBQ place using a Group-On certificate. They are fairly close to where I live and like to support local businesses.   Its a nice sized place and not flashy. I come to places like this for food, not trying to show off to anyone and Hek Yeah is just fine in this area.  Had the combo with ribs and beef, and asked for some extra sausage on the side. The fries were excellent and you could tell they were fresh. Was going to eat half of everything and take the rest home for lunch the next day but when I had a bite of the ribs knew that this was not going to happen! The beef was great as well. Sausage was fine but I prefer the "hot link" style. Their beans were also very good. Next time need to try the cookies...   Ended up having the excellent lunch then buying a whole rack of ribs to take home for tomorrow. so guess you can say I was sold on the place. The owners are great and even met another customer who made a video about the place. Kim you need to post that! Might even make you a bigger star than you are now!  :)  I will be back, no question on this! Well worth stopping in for some 'Q!

I hate to give low ratings but this place does not understand customer service. I called yesterday (Monday) and talked with a gent about some parts I needed. They had them but not in stock at this location, but he offered "give me your number, I will have them brought up from the other store by 11:00 on Tuesday and give you a call"...   Sounded great and I ordered extra just because of their nice attitude. Well 1 pm rolled around on Tuesday and not a peep so I called back. The guy I talked with yesterday was on the other line so I chatted with someone else. He said "oh the owner decided not to make the "Tuesday run" today so your stuff will be in on Thursday!"   Hmm, I needed the stuff on Monday but delayed the project for a day to get the parts. Now two hours past the "due time" and they want me to wait another two days? I then asked "when was someone going to call and let me know that my parts would not make it on time" and he simply said "I do not know"....   Folks treating customers like this sure does not help and I will not be using them ever again.

Never stopped in this restaurant but was hungry and had a few minutes for lunch over the weekend.  The folks were wonderful and the manager really bent over backwards to help, so had a very pleasant meal and experience here.

Grabbed a couple of friends and we headed to Under Review to watch the game last night.   Blown away is the best way to describe it! The feeling, staff and food were simply excellent. We were seated within a minute of walking in and had something to drink in less than 3 minutes. We then ordered 5 different things to munch on and every one of them was great. There were televisions on every wall so watching the game was easy!   Fried Pickle's, two flavors of wings, a club and fish sandwich and every one of them tasted excellent! The pizza's looked yummy and am going to have to try one of those next time!   The staff were friendly as could be (and cute as well!) and all of us had a great time! We WILL be returning to Under Review in the future!! You should as well!
