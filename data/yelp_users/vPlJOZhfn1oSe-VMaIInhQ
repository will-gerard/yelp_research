My husband is a mason, and was building an outdoor fireplace in the west valley last week. We live in northern phoenix, our 6 yr old daughter had early release from school on wednesday and i had the day off so we decided to go with him and have a girls day shopping around all the stores ive seen off the I10 in that area. We have a hobby lobby near our house but with my work schedule i havent been able to make it in there. So i was super excited on our way to dropping off my husband when i saw a hobby lobby, and even tho it was about 8 miles away from where i planned on shopping i was glad to make the drive since i have been trying for weeks to make it in there. I wasent looking for anything specific just wanted to check it out.  So the minute we walked in one of the employees said "welcome to hobby lobby" and the look on her face u could tell she had some kind of problem with me. As my daughter and i walked through the first couple of aisles i felt uncomfortable, it felt like the employee with the dirty look was following me through the store.  Everytime i turned around she was there, i could feel her staring but once i turned she would appear to be working (re organizing merchandise ect .)..after a minute a male employee joined her. And no matter what aisle we went to they were both there. Same story. I would turn to look at them and they would suddenly look away pretendung to be busy Finally i said "why are u following me?" she replied eith attutude "no..i work here maam".  Hmmm ok so we continued through the store with with those two employees never more than 5 feet away from us. I was beyond uncomfortable and ready to leave at that point just about halfway through the store and with my daughter in mind i didnt want to start a scene..so i went to check out with the two items we had picked out thus far. She pretendedto "work"  right near me even then.  We walked outside i started my car and dvd player for my kid and stood outside in a rage trying to call my husband.  The male employee came out and was gathering carts and picking up trash in what to me was an obvious attempt to get my liscense plate number..i confronted him and he said "just doing my job maam" i said "whats your job? To harass patrons innocently shopping with their kids?" he said that someone saw me "put something in my purse" i said check it than! He put his hands up like no im not gonna do that then walked inside. Ive never felt so umcomfortable in my life!!! I have a dermal piercing on my cheek bone and neon red hair. That woman looked at me and put me in a box as a criminal theif.  If they honestly thought i had stolen something isnt it their right to detain me and call the police? Oh yeah she didnt know i stole she thought i was going to steal, theres a big difference there. Judgin someones character and morale based on hair  color? Hobby lobby just lost another customer

Sherry is the only employee i can vouch for. Shes excellent at her job. With 3 customers in line and the phone ringing over and over, she maintains her professionalism and deals with each customer quickly, efficiently and with a smile.  I work in customer service myself and appreciate people like sherry
