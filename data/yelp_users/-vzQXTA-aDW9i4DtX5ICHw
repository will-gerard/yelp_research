Lux on Central never disappoints. My boyfriend and I have become regulars here. Great place to hang out with close friends. Or if you prefer to be solo and focus on getting some work done this place provides the perfect atmosphere. With multiple outlets throughout the lounge you will be able to get a charge without being secluded.   Recommendation: Jalape√±o mac and cheese  Bacon cheeseburger on english muffin   ANY of their hand crafted cocktails.

I usually come in on my lunch. I only have a 30 min lunch therefore it is imperative that I get service fast. When I come In I am immediately greeted very time. I will go to the bar rather than the seated dining area. The bartender that works in the early afternoon is great. She can miltitask like none other. She understand the importance of time management along with friendly customer service. Typically she is the only person serving the bar during the day. Overall good experience each time I visit.

If Yelp offered zero stars I would have selected it. Every time I come to this Starbucks I am more disappointed than the time before. The coffee is terrible, employees are rude and unhappy and the overall service is poor. It took 15 minutes to get a tall latte. I seen people who came in after me get their orders before I did! When you come to this location expect to wait in a long line to order and then another long line for your coffee. If this wasn't I a convenient location for work I would NEVER come here. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra few miles to find a descent coffee shop.

The waitress was terrible. It is very possible she was new. It took forever to get service and when she did finally come around she asked "what do you want" really?!  Our order was incorrect and she forgot to bring our drinks twice. I recommend newbies carry a notepad and write down the orders to alleviate issues like this.

I have been here several times but unfortunately this time has me questioning whether I will return or not. It was very slow not many customers when I arrived. Our server was pleasant but slow. There is nothing worse than a server who choses not to write your order down because they "think" they will remember it. Needless to say, I had to request the same drink more than once because she forgot. After ordering our wings we waited about 20 min before it arrived (need I remind you we were 1 of about 5 customers in the restaurant). The wings were so dry I had to request an extra side of sauce just to fully coat them. Overall, not the best experience. But if you are inclined to visit this particular location perhaps wait until the evening when they actually pay attention to their customers.

Me and a friend of mine decided to have get together and do dinner and a movie. We didn't really have a set location as to where we wanted to dine so we decided to go to a place that didn't have a long wait. Well, we ended up at Whiskey Rose!  We were seated immediately and had a server over to is within minutes. It was very spacious and not too crowded which I like. Occasionally we smelled a whiff of cigarette smoke coming from the patio but other than that pretty decent place.   The food was shockingly delicious. I ordered the whiskey Torpedoes as an appetizer and the buffalo chicken sandwich as my mane entree-- both were pretty delicious   As for cocktails- I recommend the whiskey sour with Makers whiskey    Enjoy!

This place has really gone downhill since it first opened. Seem like Every time I visit this location they are always out of something. One morning before a meeting I stopped in to order an oatmeal (1 hour after they opened) and the cashier said they were all out of oatmeal. How is this possible? Another say I ordered one of their yogurt bowls that SHOULD have contained bananas and fresh strawberries, of course they were out of strawberries. Let's talk about the store now- someone needs to completely renovate this store. Nothing stands out, the merchandising is terrible. I don't see Myself visiting this location anymore if missing ingredients is acceptable and has become the norm.

Love this place! The food was great. Customer service was superseded my expectations. I ordered the snow crab, sausage, corn on the Cobb, and red potatoes all of which was phenomenal. After demolishing my meal and drinking a Louisiana Sweet tea (made with deep eddy vodka) I am now ready for bed. I highly recommend this Angry Crab over Hot and juicy. Although hot and juicy has prime real estate on Mill ave, Angry crab has the better food, cocktails, and atmosphere.

After the first time I came here I was raving about the food, service, and the overall experience. Unfortunately, the second time I've come the experience was not quite the same. The food was mediocre at its best.  So now for two unlimited mimosas, chilequiles, angus beef hash, and toast left us at $77.00.  They were not huge portions but thought they would have been based off of the price very disappointing. In my opinion, the brunch menu should have more of a variety and offer more food. It doesn't help that we overhear the staff complaining about the tip. Very unprofessional.... Very unlikely that I will return to this establishment. Disappointment is an understatement.
