I've worked with A Better Tint for some years now. They get all my business as well as my clients. Being a small business owner, I can appreciate the level of professionalism across the boards. Erik and his crew are top notch with quality and care with their products/services.  I recently had their clear bra and ceramic series tint installed on my car and I couldn't be happier with the level of service and quality. If you're in the market for tint or clear bra installation, I could not recommend them enough.   Also, for what it's worth - they were less expensive than my dealership's clear bra package.

My sister and I have been in search of a new Pho spot after ours closed. After countless taste tests at multiple restaurants, we've found "the spot." We love their Pho and I would highly encourage other Pho snobs to try!  We always take to-go so I can't comment on the atmosphere but the other dishes we've tried are all great as sell. Solid and consistent.

I've been looking for a hair dresser for a couple years now and after countless bad cuts I've finally found my girl. Joyce is the best! She took her time the first time to figure out my hair and how to make it work with the style many have attempted and failed in the past.   The salon as a whole is nice and the staff are always nice and professional. Highly recommend.

WARNING! I ordered takeout from here last night and have been super sick since. I ordered one Rainbow Roll, one Spicy Tuna roll, miso soup and garden salad... $24 dollars  and an upset stomach later, I'm terribly regretting my decision. This is the only sushi spot around me so I looked at Yelp, saw they had decent ratings, and placed an order. Now, I will admit - they were super speedy. They told me it would be about 10-15 minutes. I was happy to hear that. I arrived and the guy at the counter was super pleasant and even told me that he would recommend dinner menus per my suggestion. I got home, opened up my bag and looked at my meal. At first glance, it looked fine. I took a few bites of the Spicy Salmon and it didn't taste ANYTHING like it. Then figured I would move onto the Rainbow Roll. I don't know who made these rolls but they should be fired. The fish tasted old and I should have known better to keep eating it but I was really hungry. I LOVE sushi and never complain about my orders, but I promise you I will never step foot back into this place. The fish was paper thin and tasted like it was dragged across a dirty floor. I'm thoroughly disappointed with my experience and caution others from ordering the sushi there.

We frequent this place for a couple years for the Arizona Smoked wings. They are REALLY good. Everything else on the menu is to be expected from a bar / restaurant. Portions are large and the staff is always very friendly.   They have generous happy hour deals and daily specials as well.   The environment is dark and typical of a bar with dozens of big flat screen TVS.

Awesome concept for Mediterranean food (like Chipotle). The people were great and very friendly. The food was right up there with others I've had. Definitely give this place a try.   4 stars because of atmosphere. It's a very basic to-go feel. I'd still go again!
