You  know you have to rate a place when you start craving it... which is the case with Arriba Mexican Grill. The first time I was there it was good but, nothing amazing, I just simply did not order the thing that I like the most.  I went here and ordered an enchilada dish (can't remember what it was called) with chicken, sour cream with a green sauce, and was blown away, it is some of the best mexican I've had since I moved here from Canada.  They also have fantastic complimentary salsa and bean dip with chips when you sit down, and to top that all off $1.00 margaritas (yes I said $1.00) during happy hour before 6:00 pm... can't beat it!

I stopped in for lunch, had the 1/2 catfish Po'boy with the chicken and sausage gumbo, with chips. Did I ordered the wrong thing?  Nothing really wrong here, the po'boy came out dry, just fried catfish and a bun, on the side they put the remoulade sauce, lettuce and tomato, so you basically have to make your own sandwich.... The remoulade sauce, which was the "make or break" piece to this dish, was really inedible, quite terrible... I've had some good, and some bad remoulade, this was the worst... it's definitely not supposed to taste like 90% horseradish! The gumbo was decent, however nothing special..  I really love good Cajun food, was really excited to try this place, sadly I will not be back.

Avoid this corrupt company... terrible!  I sent my wife in for an oil change and to get the brakes looked at because they were squeeking. They did the oil change and told her that the rotors would have to be ground down or replaced and the rear brakes needed to be cleaned, the bill would be about $400.00 I said no, bought $18.00 brake pads from another company, and did the repair myself in about an hour When I looked at the rotors, they were LIKE GLASS, in immaculate condition, absolutely did not require any grinding/replacement...  (the vehicle is only a few years old, with low mileage)  They completely tried to take advantage of my wife, fabricated a completely false story about the vehicle to try to make a quick buck... they should be shut down...  You've been warned!!

I've found my new home! If your like me and you are drawn to places that are a mix of color, character, funk and a touch of danger, this is the place!  I've driven by numerous times, I didn't even know if was a sit down restaurant, because I always say a line of people ordering from the takeout window at the front. Craving some good mex food, I was going to hit up one of my regular places, but decided to try somewhere real close, and ponchos came up.. Walked past the line of large parties waiting to get in, they had some tables for one in the back. I walked past a very eclectic mix of people, bikers, couples, tourists, and what seemed to be a lot of regulars. The atmosphere, decor, smells and sounds transport me to a place of sheer happiness. The Food: I probably could have been served a tv dinner and still loved this place... Chips and a full bottle of salsa appeared seconds after I sat down. It took me 4 bites to decide that I liked the peppery salsa, but by the end of my meal, only a half inch remained, I realize this may be something I will crave if I ever have to go more than a few weeks without.  For my main, I chose the pollo fundido, as it seems that is the go to dish here. It really was fantastic. Not complicated, greasy, or light, just simply delicious!  For a beverage, I had a small margarita, which had no price, listed. When info the bill it was only $4.00 which was a nice surprise.  After cleaning my plate, I just wanted to sit back and enjoy the vibe, listen to the ranchero music, and pretend I was an actor in a Tarantino/Rodriguez movie.  So if your in town on a smoldering saturday night, you'll likely find me here indulging a neon green bowl o happiness and an empty bottle of salsa.

This is one of those hidden gem places that you may pass by as its kind of hidden in a small strip mall. It's not a big touristy place, but it is always the place I recommend if you want the best Mexican food in surprise (and I've tried them all) I always get the chicken burrito, it's the best there is. Enchiladas are great as well. And of course the $1 margaritas on select days. It gets VERY busy on margarita days, seems people are finding out about this place these days. Ignore the (strange) bad reviews. I've been here probably 50 times and it's always fantastic.

I don't get Pete's at all... It's like one afternoon someone walked into Costco, bought a bunch of frozen bags and started a fish n chips chain, and people line up for it!? First the fish... Preformed frozen patties. Crispy, but completely boring. Fries... Frozen standard boring fries. The special secret sauce.... (Secret revealed!) a mix of ketchup and cocktail sauce. There's nothing really horrible about any of it, it's just plain, boring frozen food that's been deep fried. The only reason people really come here is because you get a lot of food for the price.

Had a chicken burrito lunch special. Filling consisted of 90% cooked onions, 10% chicken.  Good service and good chips and salsa but serving the worst burrito I've ever had in my life is an automatic fail. The fact that this abomination of a recipe somehow made it on menu of a restaurant is pretty shocking. Even if there had been more chicken, the flavor was just horrible...

Disappointing meal here tonight, had a seafood platter. Fish and shrimp were fried in semi-rancid oil. You have to change your oil occasionally! Also nothing to dry your hands in mens room - no air dryer, paper towel was completely out. I expect waaay more for the prices you pay here.

Eating here is more like an experience than just a meal. I had the salmon Yvette tonight, it was perfectly cooked, in a luxurious citrus sauce with crawfish and shrimp... This is definitely the best seafood dish I've had in Phoenix to date... Go to pappadeaux! You won't be disappointed!

Read some bad reviews, infeel i should tell my experience. I too bought a deal, and have had excellent service! Of course they are going to book up, their deals are ridiculous cheap. What I priced elsewhere at $1800 I'm getting for $200. The staff are super friendly, helpful, and knowledgable. I found out the owner is somewhat of an expert in the dermatology field, and teaches aroun the world. The office is spotless and modern. My laser hair removal was virtually painless with the newer laser technology. I highly recommend Alli..

I have to leave a review as The negatives here are certainly not warranted. Expensive? Under $5.00 for a great sandwich is cheap in my books. If you are used to the cheapest quality mass produced $5.00 foot long you know where to go, please don't compare that to this. Please don't listen to anyone saying subway is better. This is massively superior in every way. This place has a great funky vibe, excellent staff (when I was there), and something I really like... Both Coke and Pepsi fountain pop. It was very clean, had plenty of parking (maybe not so during lunch?)  Is this the best I've ever had? No but it's certainly in the top 10, and probably second best from a chain. Best would be earl of sandwich but there aren't many around here. Check this place out. Just remember you are eating a sandwich!

Ive spent some time in thailand. i love the food, so took my wife to try this place. We had the tom ka gai soup. O man, you need to eat this, it is off the hook unreal! Order some and tell me its not the best soup you've ever had, and presented like ive never seen before. This is definitely my favorite restaurant in surprise, and has to be the best thai in AZ. Also highly recommend the yellow curry, pad thai, and crab rangoon, all amazing... Seriously do not listen to the negative reviews... Just go and try it for yourself. This place is not super busy and its too bad because it is real, healthy, unprocessed food, they even grow their own herbs on the patio. Do yourself a favor next time you have to wait in line at any of the mediocre chains on bell rd and go to Tom Yum instead. Great service too, every time we've been there.

Stopped by here opening day. My wife and I both had the ham and pineapple calzone. (Called Maui waui) if I remember right. Unlike pizza, with a calzone you get the sauce on the side. The ingredients were super fresh, the marinara was tangy and very tasty. The best part is the dough, very flavorful, and not at all greasy like pizza so often is. Delicious, inexpensive, I'll be back as often as I can.

Food tastes great, staff was great, and nice decor. Unfortunately I can't leave more than 2 stars to a place I'll never return to.  I'm definitely not cheap. I eat out daily, and have no problem spending $70 on a great steak dinner.  This is a fast casual concept, not a full service restaurant. I get a bowl with under 3oz of chicken (the cheapest meat on the menu) for $14. Yes, it's all non gmo, organic bla bla. Yet I can get more than double the amount of non gmo chicken at chipotle for $6.50, and barely finish my meal. I was VERY hungry when I left Flower Child, and had to immediately purchase more food elsewhere. My wife easily finished her meal, and she takes home half at most any other restaurant.  I'm fine paying a premium for quality product, which Flower Child definitely has, but over double the price for half the protein is unacceptable. I feel that around $8 for their bowls with chicken included would be right about the right price. $14 is pushing the price to its absolute limit. If the price was right, I would eat here every week, but at the current prices, I unfortunately will never return. -3 stars for being a terrible value.
