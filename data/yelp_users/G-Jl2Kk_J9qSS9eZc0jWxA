This shop seems to have changed hands. I have been going here for years and recently lost many fish because the fish I purchased here had ich. I went back to the shop only to discover their fish had visible signs of ich but were still being sold as healthy.

They have lost another pair of pants.  When I asked about what they were going to do to remedy the situation all they could do is come up with excuses.  Either I had actually never brought the pants to them in the first place or I had left the pants there too long.  I will never use this cleaners again.  I live in desert ridge and have a business in desert ridge and will either use the organic cleaners or find another option.  I should have known there was a problem with this business when i had to send my wifes dress to texas and have a friend clean it because this cleaner told me it couldn't be cleaned.  It came back from texas spotless.    ken E.
