I've never personally gone in to the shop. So I can't speak of how clean it is or isn't. It's a college town. It's Mill. This place delivers late and it's surely better than fillibertos. Delivery can take some time depending on the night. Reasonable prices I'd say standard considering you get more meat. Great tasting subs for a great price on a night you don't want to drive!

I have been coming here since I was a kid. Everyone is like family here, and the pizza has always been superb. You won't find many places in the valley that beat Ninos. The staff is friendly and upbeat. Great little place

If you work here you're a disgusting human being. I hope all the bad things in life come your way. Parul Agarwal and her admin thugs are holding a medication I've been taking for 1/3rd my life hostage. You'd think a person who got in to medicine would want to help people. You won't find those people here.

Always my go to for my limo services needs. Great service and professional drivers. If you are looking for a night on the town or need a limo for your child's prom I highly recommend Limoz.

I tried working with them once before now and same thing every time. They stop communicating. Won't return calls or emails. Obviously not interested in making money off my labor. The first time I ended up going direct hire with the company they claimed were trying to help me get in to. Think I'll go that route again. Save your energy and go to another agency if you're eager to work with a staffing company. They lack professionalism.
