SAY WHAT??!! Food for Four Bucks on the strip?! Yes my friends, it does exist :)  $3.95 Breakfast Special like what is listed and blasted all over their reviews... I actually opted for the Egg White and Grilled Chicken BFast...it was only $6.25 pretty goshdarn good, my friend got the $3.95 special and said it was tasty. The tortillas were hard but their eggs were cooked great, the chips and salsa (must purchase for $2.95)  were excellent and the service was great. We sat at the bar, bartender was a super sweet chick and the $0.99 cent Bloody Mary's can be doubled for a whop-pin' total of two bucks and they were really good.   Go for cheap but not Phenomenal, just good food, super cheap Bloody's and I'm pretty dang sure if you sit at the bar, you not only get better service but you get better drinks :)   ate here 03/01/2014 at 11am...thank you nice bartender chick...you rock!

I agree with another Yelper on here, this place is not as bad as everyone states.  My parents have a time share here and they live across the street (literally) they go to the resort all the time since they have day use privileges also. My boyfriend and I were visiting from CA for my sisters wedding and my Dad bought us a 2 night stay here for the trip.   I was nervous to check in since other Yelpers had issues...we did not get to the resort til' 5:30 pm since we were at the wedding all day. Morris helped us, he was hilarious, nice and helpful. We got checked in just a couple minutes and went to our room to check it out....pretty amazing.  We got a one bedroom king master suite with a jetted giant tub, full granite kitchen and washer & dryer right next to the adult pool and bar.  Went to the pool, grabbed a cocktail, and starting talking with the food and bev manager down there, she was very nice. My first margarita was pretty heavy on the marg mix, she made me a new one. Then shegave us a free chicken quesadilla since someone called in an order then cancelled it, it was good.  We had some friends come by, took them and their kids to the family pool with a fun waterslide, the kids had a blast! We brought our own cooler full of beer in there, we got asked to not have a cooler full of beer since they were selling ten feet behind us...lol, oops, my bad :) they were nice about it, after all, the sign when you walk into the pool says no outside beverages right on it. We had a little shin-dig that night, no complaints, we accidentally checked out late, they were nice about that too.  All in all, we will be back, I will recommend it and We had an amazing stay.  Thanks for making a weekend visit just to go to a sisters wedding into a nice relaxing and fun vacation :)

Disappointed. I know, I know, I live in Southern California and I am blessed with amazing Vietnamese Restaurants...well I've had some  somewhat decent places here in AZ too...this one seized to amaze.  I called in my order. I got there and it was ready. I specifically asked for chili paste/sambal on the side...like an extra cup of this stuff...I get to my destination and with huge starving anticipation I open the box....super BUMMER!!! No chili paste/ Sambal...she put like an 1/8th of a teaspoon on top of my peanut sauce and that was it.   On to the roll...icky. Not good, pork tasted funny too...so sad, wont be back because 1 mile north is an awesome place that listens to customers requests.

Went for the Friday night $55.00 dinner...here ya go folks...Bellagio and Rio are WAAAY better  Totally bummed on this. Not what I expected, not what everyone else experienced either I guess :(  I was super stoked on this place as its rated the "Best" I Yelped it and I was excited...super sad faced now...  Food Coma? For sure, of course, satisfied though? Nope.  The Lobster Corn Chowda had no Lobster, the Miso Glazed Sea Bass was so fishy and cold it was inedible. The crab did not come off the legs even though they were split and the ribs tasted funny...like crappy funny :(  I was really looking forward to the Souffle they make to order...didn't have it, FAIL.   I was excited for the chicken basket everyone was bragging about on here, didn't  have it, FAIL :(  I went to get Pho, no one was there to help me and I wanted the soup dangit!!  Beers were cheap, service was good but I really cant say much more...Oh wait, yes I can...I got DIRTY SHRIMPS...nuff said :/

This place was excellent...maybe I was drinking, maybe I was starving after leaving the Cirque show but damn, their fish and chips and coconut shrimp were amazing!! No seriously, add to that excellent service and that fact that since I stayed at TI I had a two for one coupon they gave me at check in...that I totally forgot about but she added it before I even asked...this place was great.  Food 10 Service 10 Atmosphere 10  SOLD...I would go back... like tomorrow if I could, get the Fish-N-chips :)

18 minutes and still waiting for two freaking orders of spring rolls togo. Not to mention I tipped 2 bucks and they wouldn't honor happy hour pricing or offer me a drink while I wait....then they forget my sauce....don't care, service is key.

This place is great! I've never had BBQ served this way. By which I mean, sold by the pound, given to you on a piece of paper and family style seating. I'm also not a huge BBQ fan and I live in CA,  the largest melting pot of food along with the best fish taco nation ever so this is all foreign to me. While we have a ton of BBQ joints, it's never been my first choice.   I was visiting AZ and went here with a girlfriend of mine who is from TX. While she had been to this chain in TX, she states it's just average...I thought it was amazing :)  The concept and service was awesome. They let you sample everything and don't push you along like cattle. I ended up getting smoked turkey...holy cow it was good! As a side I got the three bean salad, I liked it, nothing special but three bean salad isn't really special. The condiment area had a ton of options too. I do wish they had more BBQ sauces (they only have two) but the ones they do have are good.   The line was long but no biggie, it gave me time to build my beer bucket from the metal troughs full of bottled beer, soda and ice...loved this fun touch. Place is affordable too. I'll be back for sure :)
