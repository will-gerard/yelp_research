First visit to the DBG and I have to say that I am a fan. I'm not a native to the area, so it was nice to get out and walk around without getting lost  Also, I do love the student discount! Half-price is the best price.  It seems like the trails would be great at night. The great views of the city and the mountains, the hidden nooks along the trails.... However, most of the trails close at sunset.  Another downside is that Friday (the day I went) is watering day. A few of the trails were soaked!  You should go to the DBG, but not on watering day and remember to bring your student ID.

I must admit that I love Apple products and it is very difficult for me to write a negative review about Apple. Ever since my PC died the day before a major paper was due freshman year, I have been a Mac user, a PC hater, and I scoff at the Windows OS.   I have been to this location twice for two different reasons. The first was to buy an iPhone 4 cover and the second time was for an Apple Care/iPhone hardware problem.  First time: I waltzed in around 10:15 and headed to the accessories area in the back, after being greeted by a friendly employee. Normal. After a few minutes of debating different cases, I asked for help. I noticed that most of the 1 and 2 star reviews wrote about bad customer service/being ignored, especially when those Yelpers only aimed to buy the less pricey items. I received great treatment. My Apple guy pointed out two cases that met my specifications and suggested the one that was cheaper. Excellent. I was out the door in less than 20 minutes.  Second time: My iPhone 4 was on the fritz and I couldn't make or receive calls.   Since this was not my first Apple product, I knew to call Apple Care first and talk to someone over the phone, who would then set up an in-person appointment for me whenever I wanted and wherever I wanted. (Tip for new Apple users. The phone people are great and super nice!)  Walked into the Biltmore store 5 minutes before my appointed time and ended up waiting for 30 minutes. Ugh. But when Brandon did get to me, he was great. Although he tried to convince me that my problem was software-based and not hardware-based (as the phone Apple Care guy and I determined), he was a total sweetheart when I walked back into the store not 10 minutes after I initially left with a phone still unable to make/receive calls. He got to me right away and switched out my broken phone for a new one. The second time only took 10 minutes and my new phone is great.  Two small suggestions for the store: 1) Stop scheduling your Genius appointments so close together. You know that some problems take longer to fix than anticipated and that makes all the subsequent appoints late. I like your store, but I don't want to sit around for an extra 30 minutes when I could have just been scheduled later.  2) Apple stores need to have the same express pass phrase that the Apple Care phone system has. I know that some Apple users might not understand certain tech things, but I do not want to be told that I have a software problem when I know that I have a hardware problem and I have to return to the store ten minutes later! Give me that pass phrase that lets my Genius person know that I know what I am talking about.

While at Birds n' Beer last Thursday, I learned what "riparian zone" means. It is the strip between land and stream or lake. (Cue the "The More  You Know" clip)  The center itself is beautiful and great for a small - medium sized event. Lots of modern architecture and what looks like reclaimed materials. It's an eco-friendly building with great native landscaping.  Now to the real part of the review: Bird and Beer is a great event, if you are free on a Thursday night between 5:30p and 7:30p. 5:30 to 6:30 is a chatting/snacking/drinking time with Four Peaks beer in a can. The lecture starts at 6:30 and is very informative. This month was reptile sex and last month was bird sex. The events are usually listed on the events section of Yelp, so check it out now.  The Center is easy to find. It is just south of the river on Central, with a sign posted on the road pointing towards the building and the parking lot.

A Jamba Juice is a Jamba Juice is a Jamba Juice. If you have ever been to one before, you know what you are getting yourself into. Lots of fresh fruits and some baked goods. Jamba is one of my favorite places to grab a quick breakfast on the go. Try their oatmeal. It's great.  The special thing I have to add about this location is the great customer service. I really wanted to try the new Apples 'n Green, but I am allergic to mangoes. (Evil, evil mangoes) When the Jamba Juice guy saw my disappointed face, he told me it was no problem to hold the mangoes. Now that I know this, I can try all the smoothies I want! Thanks, Jamba Juice employees.

Saturday, 6/18/2011 around 8pm  Atmosphere: Dark, intimate seating in a large space. You are in your own world at your table with other tables you can see, but cannot hear well. Good for groups and couples alike.   Service: Friendly, attentive, and well-informed waitstaff. They know what is and what is not vegetarian and they have great recommendations for drinks, food, etc.  The drinks: I ordered the coconut margarita, which was flavorful and not-too-sweet. Nice, smooth house tequila; not the best booze, but certainly not the worst. Each table also has a pitcher of ice water, so you can pour your own water. Great for when you bite into something spicy and you then drain your glass of water and your date's glass of water.   The food: Chips and salsa while you peruse the menu with an extra thing of hot salsa, so you can customize your spiciness. We ordered the chile con queso dip, el numero nueve (cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco, chile relleno, and rice), and an a la carte bean tostadas.  The queso is definitely not a Tex-Mex queso. A fellow Yelper compared it to the quesos of Austin, TX. Not even the slightest bit true. Nando's queso is a good queso, but it is watery when it first comes out. The chips served with the queso are puffy and great. Don't get me wrong, I will return to Nando's for the queso.  The bean tostadas was huge, great, and cheap. Lots of guacamole on it. Yum.  The nueve combo was HUGE, covered in cheese, and very, very hot. The shredded beef taco was a great suggestion from our server! My date ended up taking 2/3 of his meal home because he couldn't finish it.   Overall, this is a solid Tex-Mex restaurant. Large (HUGE) portions, good drinks, queso (!!!!), and a great a la carte menu where you can order a ton of food for about $5 each. Oh, and lots of vegetarian options with good (meaty and cheesy) food for meat-loving dates.

As a tiny freshman at UT, I was taken to Whole Foods (Lamar location) and I have never turned back. I love Whole Foods, from their abundant selection of vegan and vegetarian options to their wonderful employees.   I guess my only novel input for this review is for all the people who call Whole Foods "Whole Paycheck." Shop the sales! Each Thursday, Whole Foods announces the new sale items. Those are the items to buy at WF. WF also announces special one-day sales on the Tempe WF twitter account. Oh! And check out the Whole Deal newsletter. It's full of recipes and coupons.   Have fun shopping, Yelpers!

4.5 stars, near perfect.  I recently started using Del Rey Cleaners when my roommate began his internships with two firms in town. (So many suits and dress shirts and slacks. Oh my!)   I am very satisfied with the quality of dry cleaning and the friendly customer service. In fact, one of the employees (Luis) always helps me find stains on the clothes before I hand them over to be cleaned. The employees always double count my order with me before I take it home, to ensure that no items are left behind.   I wish the laundered items were available for pick up on other days than Saturday. However, the hours on Saturday are 7-7, so if you forget (like I do so many times), you can still pick up your clothes before going to dinner. (Or else you wait until Monday at 7 am.)  Three things to mention to potential customers: 1) Always remember to bring your coupons.   2) If you have a Facebook or Twitter account, follow them. Del Rey promotes specials, like double coupons days, on these social networking sites.   3) Same day service if you bring your clothes in before 10 AM.

I thought it was time to write about the amazing facial I had at Life Spa with Bethany.   My skin felt great from all the wonderful products, my shoulders and scalp felt great from the awesome massage, and my wallet felt great from using my new member ticket!  Everyone was very kind and professional -- from the girl that greeted me to Bethany to the girl at the front desk who asked me how everything went.   Two things I thought were really great: 1) Life Spa doesn't use bottled water. They instead offer you filtered water in a real glass. I dislike those mini bottled waters and I think they taste worst than filtered water.   2) My scalp massage. My brain felt like it was on vacation for the entire facial. So relaxing and so wonderful.

I am a big fan of Life Cafe. The staff is ever so friendly and the shakes are great.   I usually pop in Life Cafe for a healthy lunch after my 9:45 butt-kicking with James (Barbell Strength on Fridays). The FastFuel Complete is amazing and full of protein.   Oh, did I mention that each menu item lists its total calories, protein, carb, and fat content right next to the price? Love it!

Dos Gringos reminds me of a gross, Cancun-themed college bar that should be located in Lubbock, Texas. Someplace where the patrons have never been to and may not have heard of Cancun or the Yucatan Peninsula. But this place is in Scottsdale?  Atmosphere: Yellow and green everything. Everything. Also, I love a mister, especially in the summertime. Yet, this place needs to cool it on the misters. Everything is wet. The only feeling that arises is a negative feeling-- akin to the negative connotations that arise in some people when you say the words "moist" or "used."  Service: Okay? I guess? Different employees brought us our menus, drinks, and food, plus different people to take the orders of drinks and food. I'm not really sure who I tipped. There was a mistake on our bill, so we flagged down a waitress. She took off the mistake, with a smile, and told us that one of the servers was new-- so mistakes sometimes happen. (Plus one star for customer service)  Drinks: Watered down margaritas. I'm glad we were there at happy hour ($3 for a house marg). I don't think I could pay full price for a house margarita. Other drinks on the bar menu looked good, but I will not be back to try them.  Food: We ordered queso, a breakfast burrito, and a bean burrito. The queso was high school concession stand nacho cheese in a cast iron mini-skillet. Nasty. My designated restaurant buddy got the breakfast burrito, which he thought was great for $5.  I wish I could say the same for my burrito. Bean and cheese sounds pretty plain, but you must understand that I did not want to risk my digestive track in a place that looked like the worst of Cancun. To spice things up, I added guac to my burrito. Something the menu stated would be a $0.99 upgrade-- fine by me. When the order came out, the guac side was huge. Score! I gobbled that delicious guacamole up. Yum. When the bill came, I found out the guac was $2.99. Oh. One of the waiters explained that $2.99 was the price for a side of guac. Oh. Thanks, Dos Gringos.   TL;DR Dos Gringos' spring break died ten years ago, but no one told Dos. Yuck.

This is a Happy Hour review for this location. I have only eaten dinner at the downtown Austin location.  This is my Arizona friend's favorite happy hour spot. The few times he is up for a happy hour, we go here. The happy hour is confined to the bar area (saloon) and the patio. Be cautious of the wait for the indoor seating. The Roaring Fork happy hour is not a secret. Try the patio, you will usually have better luck getting a seat.  My friend only gets one thing: the Big Ass Burger, cooked medium rare. He loves it. The Longhorn cheddar, the bacon, and especially the poblano pepper. He is a little disappointed that over the years, the Big Ass Burger has gone from one pound of meat to two-thirds of a pound. However, this fact does not stop him from devouring the burger. Five stars for the burger.  We split the guac and chips. The guacamole is wonderful and I love the presentation. For me, this appetizer is totally worth $6.   I usually munch on the friend's fries and drink my mojitos, as there are not very many vegetarian options at Roaring Fork. The mojito is decent and the margarita is good too. I'll have to try the Huckleberry marg next time. (I hear it's great!)  All in all, a great happy hour location. Especially since it's 4-7 daily.

I can't believe the other reviews have not mentioned the breakfast menu. One of my favorite times of the weekend is 11pm because that's when Whataburger starts serving breakfast tacos. (nom, nom, nom)  11p to 11a is the best time to go to Whataburger. They still serve the regular menu, but who doesn't have an unhealthy obsession with breakfast tacos? (Or is that just me?)  For the most part, I would rather be at Whataburger some time between 11p and 11m and eat my delicious biscuits and tacos and drink my Simply Orange than go to any other fast food joint.  I guess I'm a little biased when it comes to the whole In-N-Out v. Whataburger thing. I'm from Texas. I've been to the original Whataburger in Corpus, there's a Whataburger not two minutes from my dad's house, and the tiny town that my mother lives in has five (count'em five) Whataburgers for 75,000 people. I am a big fan of Whataburger.  I do have to agree with other Yelpers that the fries are weak sauce here. I'm actually a little disappointed. These aren't the Whataburger fries I am used to. Don't get me wrong, I like them and I think they are better than In-N-Out's fries, but they just aren't the same.

I should like Green. I have been a vegetarian for over ten years and I really like when I can go to a restaurant and eat whatever I want. I like the concept of Green, but after two tries, I can say with full confidence that I do not like Green.  Atmosphere: I have no problem with the heavy hipster vibe. In fact, it reminds me of home (ATX is a hipster Mecca during South by) and boyfriend and I make jokes about the decor while standing in line. What I dislike is the "I don't give a damn" attitude from the staff behind the counter. The first time we went to Green, I asked the guy behind the counter for a recommendation between two items. He scoffed at me: "I guess if I *had* to pick, I would go with the sweet and sour." Wow. The second time, the girl behind the counter could not be bothered to greet us. She was too busy talking to the other girl behind the counter. When she finally saw that we weren't leaving, she took our order as if it was some great inconvenience to her. Sorry, dear. (Don't worry, I will not be back.)   Food: Boyfriend and I hated the food we have gotten here. First time: He ordered the greenza flatbread pizza and I ordered the sweet and sour. The pizza was an inedible mess of waxy "cheese", soggy bread, and pesto. He ate two bites and pushed it away. I mostly liked my sweet and sour except for the fact it was drenched in the sweet and sour sauce. (Dear Green, I *like* the taste of vegetables and tofu, you do not have to hide those things from me. Sincerely, Liz) Second time: I ordered the No Harm Chickn Parm. I can say that the bread was good, but it's a bit too hard to mess up bread that you buy from a third party. The chickn was inedible. It tasted like melted plastic and had the same tough consistency. I do not understand how some Yelpers said this was the best mock chicken they have ever eaten. Boca and Morning Star Farms are infinitely better (and cheaper). Boyfriend got the green hummus. He said it was good. Not worth $4, but good. The pita chips were over-fried--almost burnt. Icky.   Other:  1. The drinks are meh at best. All the drinks in the refrigerated case can be bought at Fry's or Whole Foods. Please do not waste your money.    2. There are not enough tables for the amount of people. I guess Green is to be treated like a coffee shop, not a restaurant. Plop down, claim your table, eat some noms, and surf the web. Do not leave for hours! I guess this is nice for some people, but it is impossible to get a table at dinner time. FYI  3. No AC in the "restaurant" during the summer. Unacceptable.   TL;DR: Waxy "cheese", too much sauce, inedible mock meats. Don't go.

I guess it is finally time to write a review about Haji-Baba. This place is great, from the restaurant to the to-go service to the grocery store. This place is great, easy to get to, and has almost everything you need at reasonable prices.   My friend loves the food here. He has sampled most things on the menu and has fallen in love with the chicken shawarma.  About once every three weeks, he can speak of nothing else until he gets an order of shawarma. I love the spanakopita and the vegetarian sampler. The apricot juice is great too. Really intense flavor, but really refreshing. Also, a great selection of baklava. Cashew is my favorite so far.  The market/grocery side is great too! Lots of wonderful things for cooking at great prices. We found black mustard seeds here after looking everywhere in town and coming up empty handed. And let me tell you about the dates! Best prices in town to buy dates.   I don't think there is anything else I can say, you must go here and love the food.

I think I have found my favorite pizza place. Woohoo, Yelpers. Spinato's is as good as it gets for me.  My date and I went here today (Thursday, 7/28) for a late lunch. This is the first pizza place that we have both loved. He is a lover of Chicago deep dish with a million toppings and I am much like Kenneth the Page from 30 Rock (my favorite pizza topping is plain).   Location: Spinato's is indeed tucked in an industrial park on Smith Street between University and Rio Salado, closer to the latter. You might not even notice the restaurant upon first glance. I didn't. (Look for the misters and the "open" sign.) It's not really a date-date place, so don't take a first date here.   Service: Greeted by a friendly, college-freshman-aged host and asked if we wanted the front or the back. I personally like being able to choose where I sit in a restaurant. It helps me avoid being suck by a loud table/upset babies/restrooms/etc. Our server Hannah was a sweet as could be. She didn't hover over our table and she came at always the right times to take our orders and see if we needed anything.   Drinks: As a fellow Yelper mentioned, Spinato's serves crushed ice, akin to the wonderful Sonic ice. I'm a sucker for crushed ice and would give Spinato's five stars for this reason alone. The drinks are huge. I didn't even finish my delicious Dr Pepper. Oh yeah, they serve Dr Pepper!!!!11!!!!!!11!!one!!!!!! and some Pepsi products, I think.   Food: We ordered a small house special -- Mamma Spinato's "Signature" Fresh Spinach. The pizza was the perfect size for the two of us to split. The spinach was excellent and there was a ton of delicious fresh garlic on top of the pie. After reading other reviews that complained about a "sweet sauce," I have to say that maybe the wonderful garlic counteracted the sweetness. I didn't notice the sauce being too sweet.   Dessert: We ordered the brownie bella piccola ($3.49), which was a great size to split. The brownies were not very dense, but had a great fudge-chocolaty flavor and the vanilla bean gelato was a nice addition to the chocolate overload.   Overall, Spinato's is a great pizza place and I will be back for more.

I guess I'm spoiled when it comes to liquor stores. I live in a state with both Spec's and Twin Liquor--excellent selection and organization. I also have the flagship Whole Foods around the corner with its amazing refrigerated beer alley and amazing wine section with an excellent staff.   I have a few problems with Top's: 1) Absolutely no organization in the wine section. They organize by brand/winery and not by the type of wine or the type of grape or even the region. It's impossible to find what you are looking for without searching for about 30 minutes. Ick.  2) The aisle are ridiculously tiny. I'm a 0/2 and I felt that I would knock over the towers of boxes that almost block the aisles. Thank goodness the store was empty tonight. I don't think more than two people can fit in one aisle.   3)Almost half of the wine and liquor bottles were covered in dust! It doesn't take that much effort to clean up the store.  4) Most of the beers were unrefrigerated! That just seems like a sin. Beers belong in a beer cave--nice, cool, organized, and most importantly below 60 degrees!   However,  The liquor section looked great! Tons of great vodkas and gins and all were pretty cheap. (Cheaper than Texas, not as cheap as Cali.)  I would go back here if I needed liquor. I'm a big fan of vodka and I really want to try the gala apple vodka they had. If you are looking for wine (like I was tonight), do not go here. It's not worth your time.

4.5 stars for my love of good dive-y Mexican restaurants.   I went to La Barquita a few weeks ago on a Friday night at the tail end of Happy Hour. I have to say that La Barquita serves the largest and best $2 margarita I have ever had. I love to get tipsy for under a fiver. (It's $2, so don't expect top shelf or even middle shelf tequila. This is cheap tequila, but so is the drink. )  Service: Sweet and very nice ladies serve you and make sure you are enjoying yourself. Excellent service for a dive restaurant.  Food: Holy mole the food was great. I got the mole enchiladas with cheese. They were delicious. And some good rice and beans on the side. My friend ordered the molcajetes a la mexicana for one ($12). He loved it. He is a sucker for chorizo and he said it was cooked perfectly. He also loved the Mexican cheese, chicken, beef, and poblano peppers that completed the dish. The charro beans, fresh tortillas, guacamole, and rice were wonderful additions to the almost overwhelming amount of food.   My three favorite things about the meal were: 1) the chips and salsa -- great smoky flavor to the salsa with good, thick chips. 2) the guacamole -- I almost ate all of the side guac. It's chunky and seasoned just right. 3) the fresh tortillas -- I'm a a big fan of fresh tortillas. My best friend makes her own tortillas and I am sure that they are holy because they are so good. These tortillas were just as wonderful.  Go here for happy hour ($2 drinks) and good food.

I don't think I have ever been to a restaurant where I have treated so poorly by the wait staff. I'm actually rethinking my Green rating because I sincerely think this is my worst restaurant experience.  The one good thing I can write is that this place is really cute and it has an inviting patio. Lots of string lights and cute bistro tables. I really thought I was in for a great evening. Oh how wrong I was.  My friend and I walked in and the hostess immediately sat us at a four top right in front of the door. Unless the restaurant is packed and the drafty table in front of the door is the last spot available, I do not want to sit in a place where incoming guests will constantly bump into my chair. I pointed to a seat in the back and after trying to convince me I didn't want *that* table, the hostess led us to the back. It's not the worst thing that could ever happen and that instance did not ruin my evening, it was just weird.  We sat and were greeted by our waitress, who initially seemed very nice. We both ordered water to start and I asked her for a drink menu. Apparently the drink menu is on the back of the regular menu. It's just so small that I missed it the first time. She told me that Friday night is the $4 frozen house margarita night, so I went with her suggestion. By the time I finish pulling out my ID, my dining partner was ready to order. We got a queso appetizer, the vegetarian tacos with a side salad, and the machaca plate.  While we waited, a few more groups came in, were greeted, and received their adult beverages. It had been ten minutes since I ordered my drink, so I tried to look for our waitress.   She finally popped up five minutes later, but avoided all eye contact with our table. When she did see me, she quickly ran outside. I understand she might have had a few tables outside, but why have an inside section to wait as well? The table right next to us had an amazing server who brought them two orders of drinks in the time it took to get my water glass refilled. (Margarita was still MIA at this point.)  Then, the queso came out, brought by two hipsters. It looked like an over-microwaved styrofoam plate in a skillet and tasted just as bad. My friend tried to make the best out of the situation, but I was ready to call the manager. I really, really regret that I did not.   Nasty queso juice dripped all over the table and there was no silverware or napkins to be found. AND no wait persons or a hostess to ask for said items. (Twenty minutes after I ordered my margarita, it was still MIA.)  Our waitress finally popped up and asked how the appetizer was. My friend cut me off and said it was different, but okay. He took rare this opportunity to ask for silverware. The waitress made an excuse that it should have been on the table already and went to grab some.  When she came back, I asked about my drink.  With another lame excuse that could have been avoided if she ever check on us in the then-thirty minute absence, she finally brought me my drink. It was OKAY, not worth $4... more like $2-3.   Two seconds later, the food came out. At least we had silverware?  1) My veggie tacos and side salad were okay. Is it bad that the BEST part of meal was the white, iceberg lettuce salad? 2) My friend's machaca was bone dry. Isn't machaca supposed to be tender, rehydrated, and edible?   All in all, the salsa was the best part of the meal. Yet, one cannot enjoy a dining experience on salsa alone. This was sincerely my worst experience at a restaurant and I will not go back to Mucho Gusto.

I went to see a double feature (The Hangover II and Bridesmaids) last night (Saturday, 6/11/11 with movie starting at 8:55 pm) for $6.50. You cannot beat that price anywhere!  I think this place is really great. With the exception of a few tail lights distracting my view, I didn't have to worry about anyone texting or calling during my movie and ruining my experience. (I'm a big fan of Alamo Drafthouse's anti-texting PSA found here: http://cf.drafthouse.com/she_texted_we_kicked_her_out2.html) I got to sit in my car with the windows rolled down (lovely Arizona night air), to eat my snacks and drink my Dr Pepper, and to listen to the movie on my headphones.  A few notes:  1) If you forget to bring your own snacks or you run out of snacks during the double feature, then you can go to the concession stand. (A bottle of water was $2.25, not bad for a movie concession stand price.)  2) Bring chairs and blankets to sit outside. Not that I don't love Carl the Prius, but the night air is great here. A ton of people were sitting in the beds of their trucks and even tailgating during the movie. Very fun!  3) Your car battery might die during the double feature. The car next to me had to get a jump during the last 30 minutes of the second movie. And Carl the Prius hated running his engine for the AC, so I turned off my car about 20 minutes into the first movie and just rolled down the windows. I might also suggest bringing your old walkman or stereo (battery-powered) and using that to tune-in to the film station. Everyone is watching the same film, so it's not like you are going to disturb other moviegoers with your loud stereo.   4) Saturday nights are busy! I got to the driveway at 8:20 for an 8:55 showing and we should have gotten here long before that. I say show up about an hour to an hour fifteen before your film, so you can buy your tickets without sitting in a slow moving stream of cars and so you can get a good place in front of the screen.  5) This is a CASH ONLY place. I went to the website and I didn't see any indication that this place was cash only. Thank goodness I read the Yelp reviews.  6) If you want to leave after the first film, you can! A ton of cars left between The Hangover II and Bridesmaids and the theatre gave everyone a "dead period" of about 20 minutes to leave, get snacks, use the bathroom, etc.  All in all, I am coming back. I loves the prices and I love the drive-in experience. Plus, it's a great date for under $20!

I recently went to my first First Friday (and my first trip to downtown Phoenix). After a few hours at the Phoenix Art Museum, friends and I hopped on the light rail and tried a new restaurant. Enter The Breadfruit.  Easy to find (sign on the street corner) on a charming and quiet little street sits The Breadfruit with a hostess standing out front greeting guests. You can see the very intimate seating area from the street and it was packed (a good thing for 8:30pm on a Friday night). We sat and waited outside at the cute little tables (way too hot to eat a full meal outside). We were offered menus to peruse while we waited about 10 minutes for a table.  Inside, we ordered two mixed drinks (a mojito vanilla for me). They were strong and very good. The mojito was very minty and refreshing and my mojito-loving friend said he should have ordered a mojito. (Read: Get a mojito.)  The Food: We split a tilapia patty (very spicy!) for an appetizer. (Patties are Jamaican empanadas.)  I had the coconut curried tofu with rice and peas, ripe plantains, and veggies. This is the one of the best tofu dishes I have ever had. My only complaint is that Breadfruit needs to have more plantains per plate. They are so good! One friend had the curried chicken and dumpling with a green banana, veggies, plantains, and a side order of rice and peas. Although he didn't like the whole wheat dumpling, he loved the curry sauce and the green banana. He called the sauce "delectable."   Overall, this is a great place. Small, but great. The drinks are strong, the food is great, and the serve is prompt. Our only regrets are 1) not enough plantains and 2) we should have gotten dessert.

First Friday for July (7/1/2011): This place is PACKED! Think of a sardine can. Packed. Little room to walk around from bar to seat and no room to breathe. (As soon as Breadfruit has the money, they need to expand the space! Good drinks are a total loss in such a tiny space.) Oh, and you cannot take your drink outside and sit at the cafe table-- I do not think their liquor license allows that. (Minus one star for the cramped space.)  The drinks are fantastic! They are strong, flavorful, bold drinks. Your heart may skip a beat at the prices (the rum drinks are all $8-9, the beer is $4-5.50, and the wine is $8-12/glass), but the drink is worth the money. My one (1) mojito vanilla made me intoxicated. Yes, I am a light weight, but I usually need 2-3 drinks to do the trick. (Seriously, five star drinks)   The mojitos are fan-tas-tic. Wonderful. Delicious. The Matuselum Platino rum used in the mojitos is smooth and tasty. The muddled mint is powerful, but it does not overpower the drink. It is a perfect balance.   My review should honestly be two lines: 1)Good, strong, delicious, pricey drinks that you should enjoy; and 2) tiny, cramped space not good for large parties or too many patrons.

I tagged along for breakfast this lovely Saturday morning to The Breakfast Joynt because my friend bought a Groupon.  The Joynt was a bit hard to find, as it is tucked into a shopping center, but my guess as to where it might be ended up being correct. (Maybe there was a sign near Northsight or Raintree, but I didn't see it.)  When my friend and I walked into the Joynt, no one greeted us. I didn't see a sign stating that guests should seat themselves, so we pretended to be cool and read the whiteboard of specials until a kid about the age of 14 picked up some menus and pointed to an empty table. Yay for nonverbal communication? I completely agree with Jay F.-- the Joynt needs a sign stating to seat yourself or a greeter.  When seated, a somewhat cheery waitress came and asked for our drinks. We both ordered the fresh squeezed OJ. (I read on Yelp that the OJ was great, so I decided to try it.) The OJ came in a small glass and had absolutely no pulp. It tasted like some Minute Maid product that rolled out of a vending machine. Definitely not worth the $2.99 price tag. The waitress (no clue what her name is because she didn't tell us) asked for our food orders, but I wasn't ready, so she left and didn't come back for a good 5-7 minutes.   We ordered the waffle and two eggs (scrambled) and the California Benedict and sausage. I disliked my breakfast. The eggs tasted like military powdered eggs that you add water to while in a combat zone. (Those Ready to Eat Meals with the 25 year shelf life.) The waffle was tough and chewy, akin to eating rubber. I wish I could have said something to my waitress but she didn't come back until after the bus boy took away the plates-- not even a stop five minutes into the meal to see if we needed anything, thus no proof of the awful meal.   However, my friend really liked his meal. He liked that the sausages weren't prepackaged rounds, but rather looked as if the cook formed the patties in the kitchen. His poached eggs were cooked perfectly and he really liked the avocado and tomato on his Benedict.   The Groupon was the best part, but I agree with other two-star reviews like that of Tori B., Daniel E., Ron R., Jay F., and J. S.: "Meh. I've experienced better."  TL;DR Nothing special and not worth the hype or the price.

Clean, cool, well stocked, friendly and polite staff. I don't know if there is anything more to ask for in a post office. I usually go early in the morning (9am to about 11am) or in the evening (7pm). I have noticed so early morning rushes, but one of the postal workers always opens a second or third register to help with the flow, although it might take a while.   I wish they were open at 8, so I could just walk over before the day gets too hot, but there is a decent sized parking lot for the times you just half to drive.  I did not inquire about PO boxes, but they have a ton of space and I'm sure the rates are reasonable.

Sports Authority is a great place to get your tennis racquet restrung.  The deal: If you buy your replacement strings at Sports Authority, the restringing price is one penny. That is a fairly good deal! The only downside is the limited choice of replacement strings. (Minus one star) I only saw syn gut in 16. If you bring your own string, the cost for the service is $12.99.   I guess it all comes down to how particular you are about your tennis strings. I'm a beginner and I know I need 15 gauge, but my tennis partner played on teams before, so he needs 16L or 17. We both compromised with the 16 gauge. It works for us, so hopefully it will work for you too?  Speed and Quality: The man that does the restringing is only in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, so plan ahead. I brought my racquet in on Sunday afternoon and it was ready for pick up by 10:15 Monday morning. So, five starts on speed! I also think the quality of the restringing is great.  Sports Authority is overall a great sporting goods store. Lots of exercise clothes, balls, shoes, racquets, and anything else you would need for being active.

3.5 stars, so I rounded up.  The first Saturday of the month is free, so I decided to escape the heat and visit the Historical Society museum. It turned about to be a very nice almost two hour escape.   The downstairs exhibits are great. Lots of information, photos, and artifacts. Right now the exhibits are Sandra Day O'Connor, Play Ball, and a sneak peak into museum storage. Each exhibit has its own room, so there is a (usually) calm feeling as you pace around the room.  Upstairs seems to hold the permanent exhibits about Western life, the Roosevelt Dam, Arizona agriculture, and Arizona life. Lots of artifacts, information, and interactive exhibits.   I really wish there were more museum employees -- someone to safe guard the artifacts and the other visitors. First Saturdays are popular days with families, meaning little kids will run around and they will run into you. (Happened maybe four times today... I guess I'm invisible?) I got to the museum before noon and left around 1:45. About 1, I felt overwhelmed with the screaming and yelling young visitors, which caused me to rush through the WWII exhibit and the Desert Life exhibit upstairs.   My suggestion: If you have kids in tow, come to the museum around 1. There will be a few kids to play with your kid. If you are child free and loving it, come to the museum between 10-12 on first Saturday.

For laundromats, this place is as good as it gets. Much like fellow Yelper M.E. said, "the Cadillac of laundromats."  Pros: -Lots of washers ranging from 1 loads to 6 loads -A wall's worth of dryers (30 lbs) and 2 larger (50 lbs) dryers -All the machines work! (I've been here about 4 times and I haven't seen a broken machine. Other area laundromats usually have a few machines that don't work and aren't labeled...) -Six (or maybe eight) flat screen TVs with free control of the remote -Free wifi -Magazines, vending machines (drinks, snacks, laundry supplies) -Clean everything: clean folding tables, clean floor, clean machines -Lots of baskets inside and out -Very friendly staff -If you don't have the time to wash your clothes, Eco Laundry provides a laundry and dry cleaning service. I'm not sure of the costs per pound, but I have seen enough people drop off their clothes to conclude that the price is reasonable.  Cons: -Small parking lot (I've always found a spot, but if you go at a busy time, you might not be so lucky.)   In my mind, the pros of this place far outweigh the cons. My apartment complex has a few machines downstairs but I would rather go through the hassle of loading up my car with all my laundry and driving to Eco Laundry than use the icky machines of my complex. If you need to do laundry in Tempe, this is the place.   I think Eco Laundry should buy out the loan shop next door and expand the laundromat. I would love to see some 4 load machines added to the space. And maybe some more parking spots.

Tuesday, 5:30 pm  My buddy and I waltz into Lobby's because he was jonesin' for a burger and didn't want to fight the lines at In-N-Out.  Why, you ask, is Liz B. writing a review for a burger and hot dog joint when she freely admits that she has never liked meat and her parents even paid her to eat burgers as a child? Think of this as a review of French fries, Chris's burger, and my "veggie" sandwich and skip this review if you love hot dogs/burgers more than anything.  Service: We were quickly greeted by the two guys behind the counter. Great, friendly service.  Food: Meh. My veggie sandwich consisted of bread, one piece of white iceberg lettuce, two sad tomatoes, pickles, and onions for $2.99. You can add on cheese (provolone) and mushrooms or peppers for $.79 each, making your sad, awful sandwich about $5. My buddy ordered the double burger with provolone, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and hot peppers. He said the hot peppers were good but not very hot. The rest of the fixings were "meh." As for the quality of the burger, it was a tad bit better than In-N-Out. But you pay at least 2-3 dollars for that "tad bit."  Speaking of paying more, watch out for those add-ons. Your reasonably priced burger can become outrageous for the quality with add-ons.  The fries were devoured, but there are very few fries I do not like.  Overall, I won't be back. This place isn't for me.

Confession: I mistreat my hair. I don't think about haircuts or trims until it's too late. I am known to have split ends when school gets too hectic. My name is Liz and I need help.  Thankfully, I found Honeycomb via Yelp. (Thanks, fellow Yelpers!) I love my haircut and I love how my hair feels, especially after the deep conditioning treatment.   I loved my stylist, the wonderful Lindsay Sparling. She was so nice, so sweet, and so great to talk to. We chatted for the entire cut, which was nice for me, since I am a talker. Lindsay also didn't judge me for my lack of hair care. Instead, she gave me useful tips on how to prevent sun damage, how to care for my dry hair, and how to balance my oily roots with my dry ends.   The studio is tucked into a small shopping center near 24th Street and Thomas. The sign is bright red and easy to notice (yay!).   If you are reading this review trying to decide on a place to go, stop reading and schedule your appointment now. The studio is cute, the staff is friendly, the cuts are great, and the products smell great (as noted in other reviews).

It was 11:30 on a Tuesday night and I was jonesing for some sweet, fried dough. Unfortunately, most places are closed at almost midnight. But not BoSa Donuts. They have a 24 hr. drive-thru. Success!  I am a big fan of BoSa. The shop is open from 5am to 10pm and, as mentioned above, the drive-thru is 24 hours. I love that the staff tells you which doughnuts are hot and fresh as you order. (Warm doughnuts are the best.) I love that you can get a dozen doughnuts for about $8.   I also think it's really funny that this BoSa Donuts location is obviously a Taco Bell and they took very few steps to hide this fact. Amazing.   I do miss my Gourdough's and their fresh berries (grilled strawberries. yum!), their interesting fillings, and their totally Austin toppings. BoSa is not a gourmet doughnut stand, it's a regular and very good doughnut shop.  If you are jonesing for doughnuts at 3am, go here. You will satisfy that monkey on your back with a sweet, delicious buttermilk glaze.

Brosenbrus Cafe is a pretty good coffee shop/gourmet sandwich shop. It's bright and airy and although there is not ample seating, it hasn't been very crowded when I have gone.   Drinks: I have gotten the iced milky way mocha latte. It was good, chocolatey, and not too sweet. There is a large selection of espresso drinks and non-coffee drinks.   Food: I had the Caprese salad and my ASU friend had the turkey bacon pesto sandwich. The balsamic glaze was fantastic on my salad. The sandwich was also great. Lots of black pepper turkey, bacon, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato. The ciabatta bread had pesto on one slice and balsamic glaze on the other. Perfect sandwich combination with a pickle and a side (BBQ chips in our case).   Solid four star experience. I will be back for more, including the all-day breakfast selection.  Oh, did I mention the late hours? Open at midnight to 3:30 am on Thursday-Saturday. Awesome.
