Went for breakfast this morning, and a roach crawled up my leg while sitting at my table. Went in the bathroom to get it off, and they were all over the place. Disgusting! Never eating here ever again.

Let me give you some bullets of tonight's visit:  *We asked for lemons twice in our water, but ultimately had to get them ourselves from the bar.  *We waited 1 hour for our food. The waitress told us that the kitchen got slammed, but a large table that came in after us got served before us. Clearly, she forgot to input our order and then lied.  *I ordered a burger medium-well, and it came out pretty much raw. When we showed it to the manager, his jaw nearly hit the floor. He could not believe that it was that pink in the middle.  *We were never offered drink refills  *Our table was never checked once we had food  Sorry, Goldies, but you have failed.   I would say that if you are going here, just stick to beer.

I don't think this place lives up to the hype. To start,  the waitress brought us water and when we asked for lemon, she brought it on a napkin as if it were an odd request. For our meal, I ordered the Green Chili Open-Face Burger with a side salad with jalape√±o ranch. I typically order ground beef well done, and this was no exception. Unfortunately, the burger I received was cooked to medium. I didn't notice at first because we were seated on the dark patio, and the string lights above us were burnt out, so we couldn't see our food. It was evening, and another waiter went around to light the candles on the tables, but I guess he forgot ours. Our waitress was unattentive, and my husband had to ask the food runner for water. When the waitress did finally acknowledge us, she apologized for not getting us more water, and then told me that my burger was probably undercooked because the stove doesn't work well. Good to know. Anyway, I'm just not sure I want to return. I came here a few years back, and the waiter forgot to put in my order until all the other people in my party were served. Unfortunately, the service here needs improvement, and though I like the food (for the most part), the service is bad enough for me to spend my money elsewhere.

Tonight I dined at George & Son's Asian Cuisine for the first time. I looked up their menu online, which was convenient, but the menu at the restaurant was much larger. My husband and I decided on two chicken dishes: teriyaki and orange. When the waitress took our order, she told me that it was not a good choice because both have a sweet sauce. She told me I should order a beef dish or a noodle dish instead. She was quite stern about this, and I was a bit taken back, so I ordered the Festival chicken instead. I realized as I waited for my food that I had no clue as to what I had ordered. Lucky for them, it was actually pretty good. The "breaded" chicken is really a battered/deep fried chicken, but it is crispy. And the teryaki was not too salty. Overall, the meal was a success. George made his rounds to the tables, and boxed up the remainder of our meal for us himself. He even offered to fill our takeout box with more rice from the back. I found him much more enjoyable than our waitress. Bottom line: I will most likely come back. Next time, though, I am getting the orange chicken.

What truly shines at this location is the service! My husband and I dined here on a Saturday night, and the restauant was packed. When we placed our order, we were told that we would most likely have to dine on the patio (on a very cold night) because every table was taken, and that the wait on our food would be a minimum of twenty minutes. We were making our way to the door when the manager flagged us down and cleared a new table for us. Then, when our food came, he again apologized for the extended wait and offered us a dessert on them! We were very pleased with how this dining experience turned out from what could have been an unpleasant experience. And the pizza and mac n' cheese isn't bad, either.

My husband and I were staying at a resort not too far from this place and I found a good deal on a savings certificate online, so we decided to check it out for dinner.   The space is pretty small -- maybe 8 tables or so inside, and a small patio. When we got there around 6:30p, we were the only ones there (on a Friday evening) which I thought was awkward, but it was what it was. I guess maybe it gets busier later.   Anyway, we had to order $25 worth of food with our certificate, which was rather difficult to do because their menu is so reasonably priced! We got a large bowl of olives, a cheese platter, two drinks, and two paninis. Everything was excellent! The appetizers were rather large, so I was pretty full by the time the sandwiches came out, but that didn't stop me from overdoing it on the sandwich.  I will definitely be returning --- just maybe a little later in the evening.

Wow! I've spent the last three years searching for a dentist with good bedside manner and that is not out to empty my wallet. Dr. Marti, as he introduced himself, went above and beyond my expectations. He gives a very personalized assessment of your oral health, and goes out of his way to make you feel comfortable. I will definitely be recommending his office to my friends and family.

Went there for the first time tonight. The place is nice and clean, and the staff is super friendly. Pizza is delish! Thin crust, tangy-sweet sauce, perfect amount of cheese and toppings. Check their website for coupons before going. Just might be the best pizza in SoSco.

We tried this out this morning instead of our usual trip to Dunkin down the block. The donuts were so fresh, and the raised donuts were exceptionally light! Less expensive and better quality than the other guys. My only critique is that they were almost too sweet. We'll be back!
