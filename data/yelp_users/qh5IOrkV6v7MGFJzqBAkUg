Avoid this place!!!! I had money stolen from my purse when I was under the dryer and my hair is a horrible mess now.  Went to AZ Hair for the first time and saw Teri Z. I explained that I wanted a very natural look and a trim. She said she had been doing hair for 23 years.  My hair turned out with huge stripes in it, and the cut was rushed and not straight at all.  Afterwards she said I could come back and she would fix it, so made an appointment to return on the following Wednesday. earlier that morning I put $200 dollars in my purse cash to pay for the service, and when I went to pay there was $80 missing. I went from home, right after I put the cash I my purse, straight to the salon with it zipped in my wallet. I didn't stop any where or anything like that. I hung it on the hook by Teri's station and the only time I was away from it was when I went outside for a moment, was under the dryer or getting my foils removed.  After I realized it was missing I brought it to their attention and they said I must have dropped it some where, but that is impossible. When I arrived back home I went back through my cash and it was there except for $200. I search my purse, my car and the house... Nothing. My money was stolen out of my purse. Today I returned and asked for the manager. Ends up Teri Z is the manager. I asked politely for my mo eye back and she got very upset. She said that she spent 2 hours on my hair and set aside more time for me on Wednesday to return. I said that I tipped her $30 which j wasn't asking for return but I want my money back because I don't feel like she is capable of fixing it and I didn't want it worse off.  She struggled but got me the money out of the cash box and handed it to me mi us my $30 tip, and I said,"Also I want to bring up that $80 was stolen from my purse while I was here" she replied, "I can't imagine anyone here would take it." With a rude shake if her head. And I said, " Someone took it, you guys need to be aware that there is a thief working here." And she laughed and turned her back to me. First off the customer should always be treated respectfully. I was not. I was not happy with my hair and Teri didn't want to take the time to fix it yesterday ambit I was thankful that she was making time on Wednesday. The cut was horrible and choppy and I don't believe that she even cared that I was u happy because she made me leave with lopsided hair. I paid $82 for the service and gave a $30 tip. She didn't even thank me.  Avoid avoid avoid!!! Please go some where else...

I've been coming to N'joy nails for about 3 years off and on. I've never had a bad experience or a bad mani or pedi here. I also get my brows done and they're so sweet... I don't ever request anyone, so I take whoever is available. They get me in quickly and they're all wonderful!!! Thank you to all the girls at N'joy.

Unprofessional!!! As people, I like these providers, but as providers, I need to be able to count on them, and I have to say that I can't. I am so tired of Ocotillo Family Medicine's unprofessional behavior! I have been tolerating it for about 5 - 6 years... I'M DONE!!! This was the last straw: I went in 1 month early, to refill medications. I waited the allotted 10 days after my visit, and never received my mail order RX. I called my RX provider and they said they never received the order from the Dr and will fax them.  2 days later, I still don't see a refill online for this medication and call my provider myself, Dr. Laura Leal. She is out of town now and the medical asst. says there's no record that I discussed that specific medication with the Dr. Leal and wants me to come in and see Dr. Holland in "5 days". Even though she knows I was there just weeks earlier, and that Dr. Leal and Dr. Holland have prescribed it for me consistently over the past 5 years. UGH!!!! This is their mistake!!! Dr. Leal forgot to document our talk about this medication because we started talking about another subject..  I made sure to schedule my appt early enough so if there is a mistake, I still had time to work it out, which is a good thing because there was a mistake!!!  I asked the medical Asst. to speak with Dr. Holland and see if he would fill it for me since I was an established patient and also because of a recent tragedy in my family. He would not do it. I finally got an appointment for tomorrow after giving "a tone", but it's in a different office, with a Dr. I don't know. It will take 1 day to go to the Dr, 1 day to have them fax my medication, 3 days for my RX mail order provider to process it, and 5 days to receive it in the mail, with the best outlook... That's minimum 10 days! I will be out of medication before I receive the new prescription. Also, Ocotillo Family Medicine will only refill 3 prescriptions at 1 time, so if you have more, you will need 2 appointments. This is so unprofessional! Our Doctors are supposed to take care of us!  This is not the first time I've had these kind of issues with this provider, which is why I planned ahead. I am unfortunately making a change.

They are amazing!!! I've taken both of my dogs in to get spayed and shots. The spay scars are so small that our regular vets office didn't believe that I had them spayed. I actually had to show them the paper work to prove it, so I could get the cheaper rate for their state tags. The scars look like a small umbilical scar.  The care in the office was wonderful.  On Monday, I'm taking my kitten there on to be spayed. I totally trust them!!! They are professional and answered every one of my questions. Once I got to go in the back with my pet, they made me feel special and treated me like I was their only patient. I 100% recommend this clinic!!!

I am giving a 1 star because I have never been able to use the gym yet. I was a member of the one on Germann years ago, and the whole team was friendly and welcoming. Talking to "Taylor, the Asst. manager" today at the Gilbert location was frustrating! He not very friendly at all.  I went in at the end of Nov and got a 10 day pass, but wasn't able to use it. So, I called today to talk to him about it and explained what happened etc and Taylor basically called me a liar and then told me he'd give me a 3 day pass and if I signed up he'd give me the rest of the 10 days as a prorate on my contract. He talked down to me, in a baby whiny voice, and was disrespectful.   I really wanted to sign up at this location and now am not sure, because my first impression was this extremely rude person... Who is the Assistant Manager... How can they allow someone with so little customer service skills be an assistant manager of a place that 1st impressions should be everything? After talking to him longer and telling him that he is coming across as though he was calling me a liar, he said, "Everyone says this. They get a 10 day pass, then go to another gym and get a 10 day pass, then comes back and try to get another 10 day pass and continue to do this and never signs up anywhere." Then adds,"I'm not saying you weren't sick in Dec, I'm saying that we won't do this for you, or anyone." Ok, so, his comment comes across very rude, and the way he spoke was also in a tone of talking down to me. I am discouraged and frustrated and it's all because of his uncaring attitude.  Had he said,"I'm sorry, I need to look more into your story, because we've had people say this before, please come in and talk to me about it, I'll see what I can do to help you..." Would have at least made me want to go there and talk to him and try to find another alternative. But instead I want to run in the other direction, and join another gym.

Pampered Pet spa makes me feel welcome and my pup leaves happy. I love that they don't crate my dog. I also love that she doesn't come back with burns and skin irritations like has happened at other places.
