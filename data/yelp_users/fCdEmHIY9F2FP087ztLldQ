My fiance and I go down to Hob Nob almost every Thursday. 1/2 off chicken sandwiches and $5 domestic pitchers = AWESOME! Trivia and Karaoke. Jenna the bartender is great! Lots of TV's with sports :) I'm a fan!

Just moved down here, ended up at the Sandbar on a Tuesday. Apparently Tuesday's are $2 taco night (any taco is $2). Amazing deal and great tacos! Service was good and atmosphere was fun.

I just walked out after waiting upfront for 5 minutes with no one coming upfront to serve me. The girls were giggling in the back and even walked towards the soda machine to try and get in their line if site. There are plenty of other places to eat if you don't want my business.
