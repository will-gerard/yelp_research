I have stayed here many times, but I will now find somewhere else to stay.  The front desk people are never very friendly.    Our first room of this last visit was nasty.  The bathroom tile was coming up and the door hinges were rusty and the paint was coming off the wall near the tub.  The tub had grout coming off.  No continuing maintenance is going on.   Our A/C did not work and we had to be transferred at 11:30 pm to another room.  This means that the maid did not report it not working or that they did not fix it.  Our second room was almost as bad.  The bathroom was in the same sorry shape, but the room was nicer.    The Casino is always fun and great priced for being small and off the strip.  The pool can get a little crowded, but the pool bar and hooters restaurant overlooking the pool are fun.  I won't be back until some remodel is done.  Going to try the "New" Tropicana.

This is one of the best buffets for the value in Vegas.  I have been to many and this one offers just about the same as more expensive options like Mandalay's, MGM or RIO.    This is the best one for taking kids or a lot of people.  They have an omelette station, big desert bar & many types of cuisine (Mexican, Italian, Japanese, Asian, Salads, French, Brazilian, Pastries, Seafood).    The only thing I do not like is that the weekend version of Brunch does not have a very big selection of fruit.   -Provecho!

There is not enough parking.  For something so popular, the city should figure out a better parking system.   We parked in the Bus lane on the right.   People are usually friendly and can take your picture, just ask!

My favorite place in the area for a happy hour drink.  Great Margaritas. An Best is the local beer on tap and local tequila on menu
