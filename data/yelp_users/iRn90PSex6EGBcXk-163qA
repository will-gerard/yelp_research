Not a fan of this store and it's unfortunate because I LOVE Safeway. It seems to me the items in this store aren't up to par as the other stores in Scottsdale or Chandler or even Laveen. Yet the prices are the same. I stopped in to buy my son cough meds and some other groceries and the cough meds expire in less than a month and it was 10.00, only God knows how long it's say on the shelf. Don't run in this store on your way to work to grab anything quick, the one lane open will have you late for work... Not sure if I want to stay away from safeways all together or just this one???

I use to love this place but they've taken some of my favorites off the menu and everything that loaded with peanuts. I got the Vietnamese rolls and even though I really dislike peanuts I usually can pick them out. There was more peanuts in these two than any other ingredients. They are pre made and clearly sat for a while because the lettuce was soggy and it was falling apart. It's unfortunate those aren't made to order or at lease for people who would like to omit something out of them.

Foods always good! And love that you get soup, drink, rice and ice cream with your meal! My son loved the selection and of course the ice cream. The staff was helpful and really friendly, will definitely be back soon!

I get there when they open one of the first to check in and I sit there for an hour. After they checked into people who got there after me, I asked how long was the wait. She then tells me that she hasn't check me in because the person who can check me and isn't in yet.

I had plans to go to another place but ended up here for brunch for New Year's Day and was pleasantly surprised. Didn't see the usual mimosa under the signature drinks but the sangria was a nice change for brunch and really good! We ordered deviled eggs that I was suspect about... But was excellent with the bacon on it. I ordered short ribs hash and was ok with my decision because of all the great choices, I tossed a coin at the end. The only down was my friend wasn't a fan of the Bloody Mary, although pretty in the wonder women glass! The atmosphere was clean and bright. It will definitely be back and order the devil eggs

I'm so disappointed.  My nails look horrible when I left. Polish all on my fingers yet not all my nails aren't painted. Uneven polish and crap all in them. This will definitely be the last time I stop here. They should be banned from this area.

Unimpressed. I haven't been here in years and I wanted something better than Taco Bell but didn't want Chipotle. Well I should have chose of of those. Everything I ordered was bland including the salsa and guacamole. And my churro was cooked twice so it tastes like grease instead of cinnamon and sugar.

So geico is located and apparently contracts through this repair shop. My car was hit by a lady who has geico and they didn't accept responsibility until a month later at by that time I just wanted my car fixed so I took it to this shop. They had my car for a week... They told me they were using recycled parts and my paint may not match 100%. I'm already annoyed. I pick up my car and it looks like I was short on cash and paid a shop that was not licensed to fix it up. The recycles car was red apparently; they didn't even bother to strip the paint from the previous car or my car on all areas that were being painted. My car is black with metallic specs and because of the AZ sun it's going to be hard to match it exactly- understandable. But that is a bullet geico should be biting due to their fault in the accident. But instead they are worried about saving money and tried to save money and do not even care to do it right.   Follow up 6/19 Second time I go to pick up my car, and with geico and the manger Michael both looking at it, car was still unacceptable to me. The border on the door not glued correctly the car was dirty. After me driving down once you'd think make sure the car was perfect, nope. Inside of windows were beyond dirty. And NO ONE cares. I'm going to reach out to the owner. With me driving out the way you'd think they'd correctly wash the car.

Ok I love coffee bean tea leaf, I love that they have more of a tea selection because I'm not a coffee drinker. But I'm disappointed with the way this location makes it. The past three times I've stopped here it's been wrong. Even with me giving them direction. I think they are more consumed with talking to friends then being a barista.

A 25.00 Olive Garden gift card just so happen to be missing out of my middle console after I got my car detailed here. I'm not saying they stole it, but I have yet to find it... I will not go here ever again.

I asked for fresh fries and it took 10 mins to get them. The manager was leaving and had to go in and remind them to bring them. They weren't hot so I called in and they said they would send me a gift card, I've yet to receive it.

I think I'm officially done with safeways, well at least in the south valley. My doctor called in a prescription last night, I called today to update the insurance so I wouldn't have to wait, yet I get here and "you have new insurance????" Is this a joke, am I being punked??? "Do you have the information???" What was the whole 10 min conversation about I had earlier??? This is on top of them not having one of the prescriptions and when I asked of they could transfer it to THEIR pharmacy closer to my house he told me I could do it....hmmm lack of customer service is evident on this side of town.

Came with my family and they wouldn't sit us together since we didn't pay together. The food wasn't good, it was old and tasteless. They didn't change the food out the whole hour we were here I guess they didn't want to waste it. Bowling was clean and fun, but will go elsewhere to eat.

They got me in the next day, and out in less than 45 mins and it was my sons first time seeing a dentist. They made him feel really comfortable and educated him on how to brush correctly!

So I have a tendency to procrastinate on things I know are uncomfortable. I have had a huge bulging lipoma on my back right next to my spine. I unexpectedly had a couple days off during the past week so I decided to call the office and see if they could fit me in. The got me in for a consultation Thursday, I met with Dr Kadakia in the Gilbert office, he looked at I and explained that I started a new job Monday and was trying to get it removed while I was off or I may procrastinate on it again.  Well he spoke to the nurse and got me into the hospital the next day. Well Friday came, he removed the lipoma and I was up and on my way. Not a lot a pain even 24hrs later. Dr Kadakia can operate on me any day!

Feeling like you've been taken advantage of because you're a women... Worse feeling in the world. I took my car in for a rattling nose and the service manger suggested that I get a rental for night because I shouldn't get on the freeway with that noise. I've driven with the noise for two weeks but fine. He said he should know something in an hour or so...nothing. Called the next morning, car is cool, they've had it overnight they should have an answer, not so much he calls me back at 10, he said he'd have an answer in about 20 mins, he gave me a call back 2 hours later. Said it would be my rocker arms and it would be 2400.00. Well I know a little bit about cars so I do a little more research and find labor should be no more than 3hours and parts about 500.00/600.00. I call him back and he states well bit's about time you get your timing belt changed, water pump and some other things. Maybe they are use to people being able to drop their car off and address all issues... I'm not in that position. So he gives me the price to fix the rocker arms which is the issue I brought it in. So they "fix my issue"... Well they replace the rocket arms and I have the issue. I talked to Doyle the service director and let's just say customer service is not his strong point....

I have had a box with them for over two years. I moved in June, and would only go up there when I had a package, which I would receive a text message when it arrived. Compared to the post office, their boxes are pretty pricy and the customer service isn't the reason why. So the one review is because my mother purchase me a ceiling fan and had or sent to me. The company left her name on the package, my mother is 75yrs old and stays in another town. The package was received and signed for on 8/16, I received no notification. Meanwhile I'm calling the company to see what had happen and that is how I got the tracking number sign date and name. Well I got to UPS, check my box and there is a letter dated 8/20 asking if I want to add my mom to my box??? I asked if they received the package they said yes, on the 20th. Well I advised them they signed for it on the 16th, after arguing with me about that they then said they couldn't release it to me because it wasn't my name. (I've got mail in my box with totally wrong names btw). So I asked why wasn't I contacted, they advised me they usually send it back. I was upset because they held on to the fan for 13 days and would not release the package to me and now they are sending it back. Even after speaking to the assistant manager all I heard was excuses of their computer was down on the 16th. For 17.00+ a month for a box, a little more customer service should have been given. I asked for the tracking number of the package that was sent back and they did not give it to me. The manager on duty was horrible as well.

Can I just say after 80.00 spent I was in tears at the end of the evening. I actually bake myself but it's only in my spare time so I knew I wouldn't have time. So I found a bakery in he area where we were having dinner. 21 cakes looked good, so I ordered over the phone. Then I went in on Friday and customized my cake... Everything was fine. The lady advised it would be made on Saturday, I told her the party was on Sunday. I picked up the cake around 230, and it had pick dripping down a white cake (sigh). She gave me candles and said it was the fresh strawberries in the cake???? So I go to dinner at have the cake cut at 5pm- cake was rock hard in the middle. I expect perfection from anything I reliever and was so sad this was the case. Over half of the cack was wasted.

So I had to return a bra unfortunately due to a malfunction and the staff was friendly and helpful! I don't keep receipts for those items because I don't intend on returning them, but they still made the exchange. They had the new bra delivered to the register and the cashier did not make a big deal over it or ask me 21 questions. The lady who deliver the bra started to question me in attempt to tell me how to properly wash the same bras that I've purchased for over 10yrs, but when I schooled her, she politely left me alone. Overall it was hassle free which is always appreciated.

The food was mediocre at best. I can cook soul food, who am I kidding, ANY FOOD very well, but I didn't feel like cooking tonight and yelp had a 10 for 20 deal and they had 4 stars. I go in, it's a small restaurant, decor isn't anything...  My niece warned me prior to ordering not to order the fish, it's battered like a fish stick so I stayed away from that. I ordered for me my son and my niece, with my second order I didn't want all dark meat so I order a breast instead of the thigh. When we got our orders, he mixed up which meal I wanted the change made to. That's ok, it happens- he then proceeded with, "that's not what you said you wanted". That to me was rude, I had my niece and son there to verify, then he told me after waiting 25 mins that it would be another 15 mins to fix it. My son is seven, that's not going to work. So I looked at the food, he placed greens in one plate with chicken and cabbage in another plate with the chicken. I'm not sure if he was trying to save money on plates and dishes but then our chicken was soggy by the time we got home...womp womp womp. And the sweet tea, it has to be a powdery drink mix...   Overall, the food was edible but nothing spectacular and the customer service was subpar. I will not drive that way for soul food again.

This is my second time here. I had my manicure this weekend and they did a great job with painting my nails completely and the nail design. They were even able to fix a couple of broken nails. Today I'm getting my pedicure because I didn't have time this weekend and this is he best massage I've had during a pedicure in a long time. They aren't rushing and they are actually using some pressure and not just rubbing my legs lol.

Went for happy hour that ended at 6??? The place was cute, had good music. I had an blood orange margarita and a prickly pear margarita... They both tasted the same, super sweet, nothing special. I was charged 12.00 each for them during happy hour because I requested Casa Noble tequila which may or may or have been used, which the waitress advise me of the up charge. The way the menu is set up, I thought it was the price of margarita.  I also ordered two tacos- carne asada and the chicken and nothing special, both a little salty. I guess they think that's what peeps want then they are drinking.

Food was alright at best, but it took a whole hour to get my fries, shrimp and calamari. Well I actually never got the calamari. They then informed me they removed it from the bill... Well thank you?!? And small basket of sweet potato fries (drum roll please) 6.99. Then they ran out of validation tickets so after they took two hours to disburse our food we paid 4.00/hour. Probably not coming here anymore

Pure disappointment. For 21.00 I got 6 bone in wings, beyond salty fries with cheese on the side and chicken nuggets... Seriously. I tasted the sauce for that wings and it tasted totally different once on the wings... Probably because they reused the mixing bowls. The fries were with extra salt (not requested) and the cheese wasn't anywhere to be found. Plus they were soggy so I'm glad I didn't have them put cheese wiz on them. And the boneless wings- 10.00 for ten (10) McDonald's sized nuggets. I should have went .02 miles to wing stop or a couple blocks further to raisin canes and got better food for cheaper. First and last time there.
