I took my mom here for her mothers day celebration. She had always wanted to see the Grand Canyon and walk on the sky walk. We had a lovely long day but it was very hot.  Hotel Pick-Up was included in our package. We were picked up very early because they have a lot of other groups to pick up then we had to travel to the airport.   Check in was at the helicopter terminal in Boulder City We flew over the world famous Hoover Dam and Lake Mead on our way to Grand Canyon West, Guano Point, and Eagle Point at the walk the sky bridge.   We landed next to the Colorado river and got to ride in a pontoon boat . That was refreshing on this hot Mother's Day. We then got to enjoy a champagne picnic and had time to explore the surrounding area. We got back in the helicopter and landed again ten minutes later at eagle point at the glass sky walk. We had a wonderful VIP tour or the bridge and got compliments pictures. It was amazing. We were given cute sack lunches in Grand Canyon gift backpacks. Way cool. After an hour we were back in the helicopter for the beautiful ride home, and then the long commute back with all the hotel drop offs.   Wonderful memories were made. We felt very safe and treated well. Good value for the price.

I took my mother here for her birthday. She really wanted to see this show. Since she was so excited , I purchased two seats in the second row almost center. Great seats to see all the action at $130 each.    We got there early and the anticipation built as we watched a " robot person " interact with the audience with slapstick humor. This wasn't very amusing , but maybe it was for children. There were floating eyes in the ceiling above the seats. They floated around , this was interesting to watch.     Once the show started we were underwhelmed. The "blue men" spent much time wondering through the audience trying to find out which unsuspecting audience member they were going to drag on stage for their many stunts. I paid to see the blue men group not random audience members being embarrassed doing childish stunts.  That phrase sums up the act perfectly, the whole act was slapstick childish stunts. I was not amused.     The paint ball canvas part of the act was cool and took some skill to do. I wished that more of their act was like this. The music aspect of the performance was fun, but again it required too much audience participation and not enough blue men holding our attention. The toilet paper flying through the air was fun but did I seriously pay $260 for this ?! Very disappointed . Will not be returning for an encore.

One word , Amazing!  This show is the best show you can see in Vegas or anywhere in my opinion. Once you arrive , there is a lot to see before you are seated. Sculptures, information plaques, and artwork is displayed like a museum.    Once inside the theatre you are hit by the smell of water and feeling of cool fresh air. All seats are good seats.  The closest seats are less expensive and are located in the "splash zone". I do not recommend these seats unless you wish to get damp and get a cramp in your neck from looking up, though the action is right in front of you.  I was in the middle section. I enjoyed my seats. Looking up or down was easy and I was close enough to see everything in great detail .  Up top is the VIP area , this area looked very nice and plush.  LE RÃŠVE opens with a beautiful woman falling asleep as her bed descends into the water as she begins to dream. From that moment on, it is a exciting journey into the subconscious mind.   Rain, fire, and acrobats are everywhere you look throughout the performance . Some of her dreams are happy , confusing, abstract, and some are dark. Her dreams have a hint of love, romance, humor, daemons, and darkness. This woman goes through the gambit of emotions before waking up in the morning.    The venue reports that this show uses 87 performers from 17 different countries .  The performance is a unique blend of aerial-acrobatics, water ballet, synchronized swimming, and comedy. There is even an 87 foot high dive! Truly amazing. All of the performers were very fit and well skilled. The costumes were beautiful and scary when they needed to be. Be prepared to gasp, oh, and ahh at  the marvels presented to you.   5+ stars rating. I will definitely see this show multiple times if I can.

On one of our many trips to Las Vegas, my girlfriends and I decided to go on the Vegas Strip night helicopter tour.  When we arrived we were checked in first thing and offered Champagne ( probably to calm the nerves of the first time flyers). They had a lovely seating area with leather couches and nice decorations, perfect photo opportunity.     One of my friends takes flying lessons and is a real helicopter buff. She was super excited to ride in the new ECO Star helicopter dubbed the "limousine of the sky".  It was a very smooth ride, and our pilot Mike was very funny and informative pointing out all the landmarks as we flew over them.  *** note, make sure your camera has a stabilizer built in ( like a newer iPad or iPhone ) normal cameras do not take good pictures due to all the movement. ***  Tickets were approximately $115 each plus don't forget to tip. My girlfriend told me that the pilots don't make much more than minimum wage ! Shocker.  Look for coupon deals on Groupon or Lasvegas.com.   My only complaint , it was over way too fast! Happy travels!    Sample itinerary:  7:15pm -- Pick-up at hotel. ( my friend lives in Henderson so we just drove ourselves. Easy to find and easy parking.  7:45pm -- Check-in at Maverick's Strip terminal. 8:15pm -- Flight departure over Las Vegas Strip, including downtown and Fremont Street Experience. 8:30pm -- Arrive back at Maverick's Strip terminal. ( Buy cool pictures/video of your flight and souvenirs) 9:00pm -- Arrive back at hotel or friends house unless you want to get drinks after like we did!

The sky walk was amazing. It came with out helicopter tour package of the grand canyon.  We got VIP treatment. We didn't have to wait in line. We were given free lockers to put our personals in since you cannot take your own pictures while on the bridge .  Our group had our own photographer and she had everyone pose in really cool shots on the glass bridge. Everyone got to pick out their favorite complimentary picture.     The glass bridge was kinda scary, I am afraid of heights. But step by step it was doable. Once I saw how thick the glass really was , I was okay. You get to hang out on the bridge for approximately ten minutes. After the bridge there is a gift shop. Out side of the shop you can pick up your items from the locker.  You can look at Eagle point and other Indian artifacts in the area. We were given sack lunches and Other food items could be purchases. This is a great unique photo , I recommend you getting one. See my two below.
