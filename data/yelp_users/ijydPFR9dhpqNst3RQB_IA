I would eat here again! The prices are very affordable and the food was delicous! We ordered the combo appetizer with was bursting with different flavors and spices. The tandoori chicken was good, but the portion was skimpy and there was more bone than meat. Our lamb saag was awesome! Perfectly cooked lamb that was fork tender and the sauce was yummy. I was so happy they didn't skimp on the meat. Our portion had a lot of tender lamb in it. Best mango lassi I've had in a while. We completed out meal with the gulab jamun. Delicious! I'm not used to it being served cold, but the flavors were spot on. Great service and a fun atmosphere due to the musc played.

My husband,  son, and I were out and about when we realized we were all hungry.  We happened upon this little mom and pop place and decided to give it a try.    My husband and I both got the Bento Combo. He got lemon chicken and I opted for the curry chicken.  For about $9 you get teriyaki chicken, another entr√©e,  an eggroll, salad, crab puff, and soup.    The teriyaki chicken was excellent. The meat was tender and the sauce was delicious.  My husband's lemon chicken was amazing! I wanted to keep stealing bites. Their curry chicken is just right. Not overwhelmingly spicy, seasonings just right. This was my 1 year old's favorite dish.    The soup and salad were nice and the eggroll was pretty good too. My husband enjoyed the crab puffs.    The restaurant is nicely decorated and the woman working the front was very sweet.     My only gripe was having to pay 35 cents if I wanted to refill my small soda.    We'll definitely be back if we find ourselves in the area.

I came here looking for answers to my chronic all over body pain. Dr. Crowley and the rest of the staff are amazing! It's a rare thing to find a doctor who will listen to you and take time to answer any questions. I'm an RN so I'm somewhat skeptical of physicians. I highly recommend this practice. Dr. Crowley went above and beyond when I told her about my troubles finding a psychiatrist and she immediately got me an appointment with an amazing doctor! I have some answers now and even though I still have the pain, it is easier to deal with knowing I have such an amazing medical staff to help me through it.

I cannot for the life of me understand the bad reviews. I've been seen here for years and have never had an issue with the staff, scheduling, billing, etc.    I am now seen by Dr. Kruetz. He's awesome! He's personable and knowledgeable. As an RN, I know many doctors are pill pushers. Dr. Kruetz is not! He's big on educating patients on other methods of pain relief. From exercise to diet.     Knowing his goal is the same as mine, to manage my fibromyalgia with the lowest dose of medicine possible, is reassuring.    The MA that I usually see is the sweetest woman ever! She remembers that I have kids, their ages, my job... just little things that make my visit seem like I'm a person and not just a number.   The reception desk staff is friendly and efficient.    I'll continue to be a patient here and I'll continue to refer friends and family here.

I was recommended this place by several people on a community Facebook page. I was very concerned about out Boxer and had asked for an emergency vet.    I called ahead and was put on the triage list. Once we arrived two techs brought a gurney out to help us get Ali out of the car. They took her back to be seen by the vet while my husband, daughter, and I waited.    Then we were ushered into an exam room and when the vet entered, she gently told us what we already knew. It was our sweet Ali's time to cross the Rainbow Bridge.     Once the decision was made, they brought us to a different room. It had dim lighting, a couch, tissues, windows with curtains, and some beautiful pictures... one of the Rainbow Bridge.     The staff was very considerate and they clearly empathized with our pain. They gave us however much time we wanted to say our goodbyes to our beloved family member. The vet explained what the process would look like.     Once Ali crossed the bridge, we were allowed however much time we needed.      The staff here is caring and considerate. The vet explained everything clearly and took her time. The facilities are clean and the room we ended up in was comfortable.     My only reason for not giving 5 stars is the cost. We understood the $100 ER fee. But to cremate with no ashes returned was close to $300. If we had wanted her ashes back we would have had to pay nearly $500.     We couldn't let our dog suffer and the money was spent knowing we made the right choice. But the cost probably  doesn't help when making this tough decision.     If ever a pet of mine needs emergent care... I would definitely bring them here. They will get the best care possible.

The ED leaves a LOT to be desired.  I was seen there last year for an allergic reaction.  I was left waiting in the waiting room for hours as I wheezed and itched and had heart palpitations from my Epi-pen. I'm an RN, so I know I wasn't dying, but I have never not been on a heart monitor after using my epinephrine.  Even the other patients and their families were wondering why I was left waiting for so long.   Due to that experience,  I was verrrry hesitant to have my son there last November.    I did have one horrible visit when I had a scare near the end of my pregnancy.  An over zealous nurse told everyone I was in active labor which got me pitocin,  an epidural,  and of course no food for over 24 hours. Turns out that I hadn't been in active labor at all. My baby and I were put under unnecessary stress. I filed a complaint with the director of nursing,  which was handled promptly.     When I did give birth a week later, my L&D nurse was nice, but inexperienced and overwhelmed with my (unintentional) unmedicated back labor.     My postpartum nurse was AMAZING! I wish I could remember her name.  I did thank her via the review slip I filled out before being discharged.     I'm due with my third early next year and I need to really think about where I want to have my daughter. My experiences with Chandler have not been too great.

My fiance and I came to Ben Bridge after a horrendous experience at a London Gold. We were pretty upset, but the salesperson at Ben Bridge put us at ease. We told her our price range and what we were looking for and she went to work finding us the best diamond for our budget. She even spent time educating us on the different grades of diamonds and their colors. We ended up purchasing a lovely white gold engagement ring with a princess cut diamond and a white gold wedding band to match. I was so pleased with the service and the prices as well as the selection. I wish I could remember the name of the saleswoman who helped us. I have recommended Ben Bridge to several friends since our visit there.

Came for breakfast at 09:20 on 09/05/2015.... lights were on, cars in parking lot.... place was closed. Sat in the drive through for a couple minutes.... nothing. Went to McDonald's across the street instead. Apparently Wendy's doesn't open until 10am. Seriously?! Geez.

I see Dr. Anderson as my primary care physician. He's an incredibly empathetic and professional doctor. He always takes the time to listen to my concerns and answer my questions. The rest of the staff is wonderful too. Even though I live in Maricopa now, I refuse to find a closer primary. A doctor like this is rare in this day of get-em-in-get-em-out practices.

I have been bringing my daughter here since last year for orthodontic work. I had been referred by several people.   Even though it is taking longer to get the treatment here than at another dental office, it is worth it!   We were quoted over $8000 for her dental work through several dentists. At Midwestern, we paid a fraction of that cost. My daughter had no dental insurance at the time, so the cost was a very big factor in my decision to have her treated here.   The doctors are top notch and the students we've dealt with have all been eager, caring, and have gone above and beyond to make both my daughter (Who was 8 when we started her treatment plan) and I comfortable.    It can take a while to get an appointment, but it is worth the wait!    The campus is clean, as is the clinic. I recommend Midwestern to just about everyone I know.    Hey, if they can tell my child they have to pull teeth in such a way that she's actually OK with it... they win major brownie points with me! She actually looks forward to seeing "her" student doctor!

I remember when this little place was owned by Ken and was called The Sushi. I was upset when Ken sold the place, but Masa has worked wonders!  The sushi here is phenomenal! I haven't ordered anything I haven't loved! Their Volcano Rolls are amazing and I make everyone I'm with try it. :)    The staff is very helpful and nice, especially Iris.    I recommend Fresh Wasabi to all my sushi loving friends. Best sushi in Arizona by far!

We came with my kids, husband, and my parents for lunch one Friday.  The decor is fun and does give you the feel of being in a rainforest. However the sounds and thunder/lightening are soooo loud. My 2 year old was terrified and still talks about the "scary restaurant ". Lol I ordered the paella. It was delicious, though the rice seemed a bit greasy. Everyone in the party was happy with their food. But it's the prices that get me. It's so overpriced for what you get.  I probably won't ever come back to the "scary restaurant " again. I came, I saw, I was not terribly impressed.

I moved from the west valley to the FAR east valley about a year ago. This would have been a sad, sad time for me... saying goodbye to the west valley Chino that I have grown to love and adore. But after I tried this location, I knew life would go on.    Everything I eat here, I love. This place is just awesome and fun and you must try the jerk fried rice!

Walked in on a Saturday evening and the place is empty. Totally empty, save for the guys working. Not a good sign. Perhaps it was that the fact that their sign wasn't working. But perhaps that assumption is too kind.    You order at a cash register after looking at the menu and pictures of the rolls taped to the glass of the sushi bar. Kind of makes ordering difficult if you want to take your time perusing the menu. At least the place was empty and we didn't feel rushed.    We ordered edamane, dumplings, and miso to start. The edamane was a bit too salty. The dumplings were fried, crispy, and fairly tasty. I didn't have the miso, but my sister-in-law and daughter were not impressed. They said it tasted like the instant kind you can buy at a grocery store.     We tried a few rolls next. The vegan friendly caterpillar roll was ok. It was too saturated in the sauce though, which made it fall apart the instant you tried to pick it up. The Hawaiian roll was totally bland. I couldn't even tell you what was in it. The spicy California roll was indeed spicy. That's about all I can say. The spider roll was pretty good.     This is the deal. You pay more than you should for small, subpar portions of bland food. The restaurant tries to be trendy and sleek with its decor, but when the ordering is set up like a fast food place... well yeah. It kind of kills whatever ambiance the place could have.    2 stars because I didn't get food poisoning. But that certainly isn't enough to make me want to go back.

Every time I have been here, my pets and I have been treated with compassion and respect. When I had to put my beloved elderly cat to sleep, they allowed me as much time as I needed to say goodbye & treated him with love and respect. My dog ripped a skin tag off her belly and they got me in within minutes of my calling for an appointment. She was bleeding (not a lot, but steadily) & they took care of the skin tag, sutures, local, & staple removal for a very fair fee. I will continue to bring my pets to Maricopa Wells regardless of the horrible things being said all over the internet stemming from one incident. The staff have never been anything but professional and caring to me and my other family members who bring their pets here. There are two sides to every story and I find it very hard to believe what I am reading based on my experiences.

I'm upping the stars to 5. Let me explain why.   Our boxer dog, Ali (say Allie), was diagnosed with mast cell tumors about a year ago. Recently one of her tumors ulcerated,  so I set up an appointment for her to see Dr. V.    Ali must have remembered Dr. V as being the one who removed her skin tag a while back. She was very nervous and trembling. Dr. V took extra time to calm her with soft words and ear scratches. :) When Ali was ok, she started her exam.     I told Dr. V that with Ali's age (11 or 12, we aren't sure), we wanted to do palliative care only. So Dr. V explained what that entailed.     My sweet boxer has her faults though. She's aggressive towards dogs her size and larger. I always remind the staff of this so we can be cautious. Because there were two large dogs in the waiting room, the vet tech handled Ali and ushered her outside without incident.    Dr. V and her staff truly care about the animals they see. That's so important for me because Ali is family and deserves the best.

I've heard so many wonderful things about this chain that I was pretty excited to try it. I came here with my family a while back and none of us were all that impressed. The service was pretty good. Our waitress was friendly and had a good sense of humor. It was the food that failed to impress. I ordered a calzone, my husband and father got sandwiches, my mom got a salad, and my daughter ordered chicken strips. The food was just kind of... blah. It tasted ok, the portions were the right size... but everything tasted kind of flat. I don't think I'll return. Maybe it's just this location, but either way, it just left me with a bland taste in my mouth.

I chose Mercy Gilbert because they are much more accommodating of women wanting an unmedicated delivery.   Things didn't go quite as planned and I ended up getting an epidural. The doctor who performed the procedure was so quick and nice it was over before I knew it.     The nurses caring for my daughter and I were amazing! My L&D nurse was just so fun. She really helped make my delivery and transfer to postpartum as comfortable as possible. I wish I could remember her name.     My postpartum nurses were incredible! You can really tell these nurses love their jobs.     Mercy Gilbert is also a big proponent of letting the mom and baby bond as much as possible. This made our stay easier.    The rooms are big and had pull out beds so my husband could stay with us.    I would recommend this hospital for any pregnant woman.

My husband and I come here once a month for UFC events. We drive from Maricopa. The last two events have left a bad taste in my mouth due to the lack of respect we get after paying our $5 cover for the PPV event. Our most recent venture left us out of the usual room we sit in for Virginia Tech fans. Now I love me some college football... but when I'm paying money for an event... I don't expect duel events to be competing... is Catch 22 suddenly a V-tech fan base? If so.... could we not have been made aware of this? The service is sub-par as is most of the food. I'm sure I can find another bar that plays the PPV UFC fights. Besides, who roots for Virginia? Go NEBRASKA CORNHUSKERS!!!

The ONLY reason I'm not fiving 5 stars is because the waiter got two of our orders wrong. However... we didn't care because the food is just that good! I cannot wait to go back again! Don't forget to take advantage of the check-in special. The guacamole is delicious!

My husband and I decided to celebrate my birthday a little early. We had received a Groupon for the Dhaba as a Christmas gift and decided to use it on 01-01-13.    Upon walking into to nearly empty restaurant, we were seated and told our server would be with us. Once she discovered we had the Groupon, she told us they didn't accept them on this day because it was a holiday. We promptly left.   Once in our car we checked the Groupon and discovered that New Year's Day was not one of the days listed as a day the coupon would not be accepted. So what the heck?   This is our second time at the Dhaba. After receiving shoe-leather lamb and being told it was always cooked that way, we almost didn't want to give it a second chance. After not being able to use a perfectly good coupon on day not listed in the fine print, we will not be returning to the Dhaba.    We'll eat at Star of India on Chandler Blvd. instead. The lamb there is cooked to perfection.

My husband and I came here for our anniversary dinner after buying a Groupon. I was a little concerned because of the negative reviews, but I was very pleasantly surprised!      The staff is very nice, very accommodating,  and always nearby when needed. Our waiter, Jos√©,  was awesome!      The complimentary black bean and chipotle hummus is sooooo good! We started with the aged meat and cheese plate. Everything was delicious. I ordered the herb roasted chicken with duck fat saut√©ed Brussels sprouts and wild mushrooms. Wow! The skin on the chicken was perfectly crispy and the meat was tender and juicy. The vegetables were addictive. I could have eaten a plate full of them! My husband ordered the filet mignon with horseradish potato puree and 5 cheese creamed spinach. The filet could have been cut with a fork. It was cooked just right. We ended the meal with dessert. My husband got the strawberry shortcake with vanilla bean ice cream. Delish! I got their humongous chocolate cake. It was decadent and I ended up bringing half of it home, it was so big!     If our budget ever allows, I'd love to come back and eat again.     The ONLY gripe I have is that the seating isn't very comfortable. The atmosphere is nice and the views are beautiful, but the chairs are uncomfortable. Small matter since everything else was fantastic.

My husband and I found Great Wok a few weeks ago while searching Yelp for Chinese food. Wow! The place is small, but the food is amazing and the price is right. It was a Friday evening and they must have been short staffed. While the service was friendly, it was slow. My orange chicken was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. My husband ordered the Mongolian beef which was pretty tasty, even though it isn't on my list of top choices. My husband enjoyed it very much. :-) The dumplings were perfect and the wontons weren't at all greasy (as they can sometimes be). We'll be back!

Um... where do I start? My husband went to the buffet where the food looked as though it had been sitting under the heat lamps for about three hours. I ordered the General Tso's chicken combo. The chicken was chewy and the sauce was hardly what you could call spicy. The fried rice had bits of hard chewy chicken (?) in it and the egg roll was so greasy it was hardly edible. We ordered fried won-tons and they were saturated in grease. I had heartburn before I even left the restaurant. Save yourself the indigestion and the money and go somewhere else.

My husband booked a day at the spa for me for our anniversary (yes, he's awesome!).    I was treated to a massage by Sarah who was comfortable doing a pregnancy massage on me (I'm 5 months), a facial by Ginger who was just incredible, and a hair treatment and cut by a lovely young lady who's name slipped my mind.    I was very happy overall and will return!

I will be perfectly honest, I had really low expectations. Unfortunately Maricopa isn't really known for its amazing restaurants. Thankfully, I was very pleasantly surprised!     It's a small location and since it was Friday night, it was very busy. But we had some pretty good service and the staff was very nice.    We ordered their 15 piece sashimi plate and it was fresh and tasty. The slices were nice and thick. The tuna was a bit on the tough side, but that's a minor complaint.    The dragon roll was tasty. I could have done with the actual rice/crab part being so large though. It made the amount of eel seem small-ish. Which it wasnt. I just wanted less of the other stuff so I could enjoy the eel more.    Their spicy tuna and spicy crab rolls were delicious! The tuna had a really good kick to it, which I loooove. Their tempura shrimp roll was tasty too. Again, I wish there was less of everything else so I could enjoy the shrimp more.     The prices were very reasonable and they have happy hour specials as well. So we were able to stuff out faces without breaking the bank. Always a bonus.    This isn't the BEST sushi out there. But for a small little hole in the wall, it certainly is worth trying it out. We'll be back for sure! It's nice having a good place to eat so close to home.

The food was average Wendy's fare, the service was ok. The thing that got to me was the ladies bathroom.     There was hair in the sinks. Both sinks. Not a stray hair. A bunch of hair. Like someone who was balding had brushed their hair while leaning over the sinks. I actually gagged. The hand dryer wasn't working either.     You can tell a lot about an establishment by the state their bathrooms are in.

I had heard so many good things about this place. But I'll admit, I wasn't very impressed.     I ordered the gyro and the meat looked like lunch meat slices. It was pretty good though. But I did add a lot of tzatziki sauce. My side was rice. Just rice. No seasoning or anything. Just a lukewarm clump of unseasoned rice.     My mother in law ordered the sampler appetizer dish. The hummus was nice, the baba ganoush was pretty tasty, the dolmas were good, but the tabbouleh  was mostly coarsely chopped parsley.    I ordered the baklava for dessert. I have a serious baklava addiction. This baklava.... it was weird. The pastry itself had very little honey in the nut mixture. So it was super dry. Instead of a drizzle of honey over the top, it appeared they poured a bunch of corn syrup instead.      Our service was decent. The restaurant was clean, but it just felt as though it was trying too hard to be trendy.    Will I go back? I don't know. I can get better Greek food at some of the hole in the wall places I've tried.

When my daughter and I moved to Maricopa I was concerned about enrolling her in a new school. Her old charter school was so amazing that I was starting to feel discouraged when I looked at the public schools in the area. I found out about Legacy and fortunately we were able to get her enrolled. It is, in my opinion, the best school in Maricopa. My mother, who is a teacher at an exclusive private school in the state, is impressed with Legacy as a whole. :)

The teacher my daughter had when she first enrolled here was great. That was in 3rd grade.  My daughter is now in 5th grade and we have had issues with the last two teachers.     They may be college educated, but they were both first year teachers. My daughter has ADD and requires a strict teacher with experience.  What she has had are teachers who don't seem to care or who are overwhelmed with teaching their own class for the first time.    My next step is to meet with the principal and discuss my concerns. Legacy has a good reputation as a whole, but this campus seems to be headed down hill.

This is one of my favorite little places to eat! Everything I've tried has been amazing and the food portions are pretty big.     The only downside is the price. A smoothie starts at $9. It makes eating here (for me) a rare treat.      I love that local produce and fresh ingredients are used.     My weakness is their raw desserts! You must try the raw cheesecake or tiramisu. My go-to for an entr√©e is their Elephant Curry Bowl with tofu.

All you can eat sushi may make most people think of sub-par sushi rolls. But this place really delivers! My husband and I were in Vegas for our Honeymoon and decided to give it a try.   I'd definitely go again if I ever find myself in Vegas. For $26 how can you go wrong?

I was really looking forward to eating here based on all the reviews. But my husband and I were really disapointed. The food was just okay. The oft raved about dumplings were so greasy we could hardly eat them. We tried a wide variety of food, but nothing really wowed us.    I forgot to add that while we were sitting there a cockroach ran across the floor. O.o

Do I have to give a star? Marco was the most unprofessional contractor I have ever dealt with. We hired him and his team to landscape our backyard. Nothing too crazy,  just some grass, a brick border, gravel, and a new sprinkling system. He quoted us a fair price.   It started out that he didn't even start on the day he said he would. Then he dropped off the sod and didn't even lay it until a week or so later. The brickwork was sloppy and not even cemented in place, the sod was brown, our yard hadn't been leveled so water pooled, the sprinkling system hadn't been replaced, he damaged the side of our house and our block wall with his machinery and denied it... I could go on.    When my husband told him he was going to file a claim against him, he showed up at our house,  pounding on our door. He and my husband argued and he had the audacity to essentially say that if we had wanted it done well, we should have paid more!   In the end, he sent the other contractor in the company to fix the job. It still isn't perfect, but at least we don't ever have to deal with this company again.     In the end, I wish we had gone with Farmer Juan. He did the backyard at our old house and it looked great. The job only took 3 days, where as with D&L, we had them in our backyard for close to three weeks for the same amount of work.

I LOVE Dr. Kells and his staff! I stumbled upon his office listing online when I was searching for a new OB. I had just found out I was pregnant and the OB I had been seeing had just retired.    The thing that has impressed me the most is that Dr. Kells has called me PERSONALLY. I was on a lot of medications when I found out I was pregnant and Dr. Kells did research on them and called me to explain all his findings, even giving me numbers for places to follow up with. He also called when I had a concern, asking me questions and putting my mind at ease.    Their office has squeezed me in twice for same-day visits due to my symptoms and background. I have always been met with compassion and top-notch care.

We came here to watch a UFC fight. I don't have any complaints except that the food was a bit pricey.  The staff was friendly. The food was delicious, though as I stated, a bit expensive for bar fare.  The place is clean and has a hip vibe to it.  It was the perfect place to watch the fights at. I'll definitely be back for more UFC events.

I'm just happy to have a theater so close! The theater is comfortable and the staff is friendly.    The only problem is their popcorn. While tasty, it has made my husband and I sick both times we ate it. We aren't the only ones who have had this problem either. Several of our friends have said the same thing. Such a disappointment because popcorn and movies go hand in hand!

The first time I went to Maricopa Smiles, it had been nearly 12 years since I had seen a dentist. I was terrified. But the staff put me at ease and before anything was done, the costs and options were discussed with me. They also explained what my dental insurance covered.    The dentist was gentle as was the hygienist. Thankfully my teeth weren't as bad as I had feared. A deep cleaning and a couple fillings later and I was done... and still alive!    My husband and oldest daughter are also patients at Maricopa Smiles.     We have never had anything but good experiences and will continue to be patients here.

This park is expansive! The different play areas were so fun. My son loved the farm area and we found several spots perfect for his age of 2.   Their were jungle gyms, slides, swings, plenty of shade... the only thing I didn't check out were the bathrooms.    The ramadas were clean and so was the play area. We'll definitely be back!

Wonderful quality sushi/sashimi here! It was very fresh and the presentation is beautiful! I adored their Pink Lady Roll. The prices are very fair for the quality of food we enjoyed.     The restaurant is sleek, modern, and clean.     The service is slow, but let the staff was friendly. The only complaint I have is that when the waitress accidentally spilled/dropped plates and soy sauce all down my back as she took our dishes, the manager didn't swing by our table. The waitress offered to treat us to dessert, but we were stuffed. It would have been nice to get a discount or even just a "are you ok?" from the manager though.     Despite this small snafu,  we'll be back. :)

I switched over to MomDoc because Tiffany Jackson is the bomb! I'm 32 weeks along and nearly went into pre-term labor when I found out she was leaving the practice I had been seeing her at. :)   But thankfully MomDoc accepts my insurance. Even though the drive is further than the office I had been seen at, it was an easy choice to switch.   The office was able to schedule my appointment with no problem, so my care was uninterrupted.    The office is beautiful! The exam rooms are comfortable and the staff is so nice!    I have nothing but good things to say about the previous practice I had been seen at. But when you are comfortable and happy with your provider (Tiffany), you follow them!

My daughter and I were in the area after an appointment. We checked out Yelp to see what was nearby and this popped up.    Sometimes it's a risk listening to the reviews of fellow Yelpers. Not this time!   Pastries and Chaat is a tiny little place tucked in a strip mall. Walking in, you are greeted by a clean, minimally decorated dining area. The pastry display is like a slice of heaven! A wide array of cakes and mousses are beautifully displayed.    My daughter ordered the chicken tikka pizza. It was unexpectedly delicious! I ordered the samosa chaat. It was very tasty. I'm normally not a big fan of chutney, but the spices were spot on and the yogurt sauce helped cut the tang of the green chutney down a bit. The chickpeas were plentiful.      We decided to try some dessert. Oh. My. Gosh! I wanted to just bury my face in the slice of cake I ordered.    The next time we're in the area we plan on stopping in and trying more of their chaat selections as well as their amazing sweets!

I'm not sure where to start. I guess I had my hopes up because there are few good places to sit down and enjoy a meal here in Maricopa.     We went during their soft open, they are now officially open. But I haven't heard anything positive about this place from any of our friends since their opening.    The chips were bland and their salsa was little more than tomato sauce with a couple of chunks of onion. I ordered the Tres Amigos which had chile rellano, chile verde, and chile Colorado. The pork was tough, but the verde sauce was nice. The chile Colorado was bland and even though the beef was tender, it lacked flavor. The chile rellano was ok. I did feel that the breading was too thick, but thankfully the cheese was tasty.  The refried beans reminded me of baby food. Pureed beans thinned with a bit of water. The rice was mediocre at best. My husband ordered the chicken enchiladas. He was unimpressed.     Our server was prompt, but I seriously think he was high. Cocaine is a hell of a drug I hear. He didn't speak any English, which made ordering a pain. He also made us feel like we were being an inconvenience any time we asked for a refill.   The wall decor is fun, though the elk head leftover from when the space was Teakwood's was a bit odd. :)

I'm not sure where to start. I guess I had my hopes up because there are few good places to sit down and enjoy a meal here in Maricopa.     We went during their soft open, they officially open tomorrow. So I truly hope that they are able to pull through and elevate their food.    The chips were bland and their salsa was little more than tomato sauce with a couple of chunks of onion. I ordered the Tres Amigos which had chile rellano, chile verde, and chile Colorado. The pork was tough, but the verde sauce was nice. The chile Colorado was bland and even though the beef was tender, it lacked flavor. The chile rellano was ok.

My husband and I were out and about with our two youngest when we happened upon this place. We decided to check it out. Wow! Am I glad we did.       I did the Build Your Own Bowl and had tofu, no carb option (twice the veggies), with the green curry sauce. The tofu is organic non-GMO and everything I ordered was vegetarian. It was incredible! Fresh veggies, perfectly grilled tofu, and the sauce was spicy and flavorful.     My husband ordered a spicy tuna roll and the cucumber salad. He was very happy with the flavors.    My son (22 months) had the kids teriyaki chicken with noodles. The kids get the option of having a cookie or mandarin oranges. My son had the oranges. It also comes with a drink. My infant daughter passed on the food. ;-)   It's a sit down/take out place. You order at a counter and they bring the food to you. The service is speedy and the prices are good.    We were able to eat a delicious, healthy meal for about $20 for all of us. In a country where fast food has become a staple in many people's diet, Tokyo Joe's is a breath of fresh air.     If you eat meat you're covered. Pescatarian? They have fish. Vegetarian?  No problem.      I will definitely be back!

I ordered online so I could pick up and make it back to the office in time to enjoy my break. It's easy and convenient to order online... HOWEVER... they made the wrong bowl for me and I didn't notice until I was already back to my office. I had wanted the BP bowl, but received the Acai Banana Berry. It was good. Very good. The fact that it's so close to my work and is vegan is awesome!  But I'm still sad that I didn't get the peanut butter my heart was set on.

I consider myself something of a doughnut connoisseur. So when I kept reading rave reviews on Facebook I decided I needed to check this place out. My daughter and I came on a Sunday during the late morning. The line was almost out the door and the display case looked as though they were having trouble keeping up with the demand. but these donuts are made fresh and are heavenly.   We ordered A chocolate frosted, maple frosted, and a Boston cream. The first bite was like an orgasm for my tongue. the donut was light and fluffy but with a bit of a crunch and were not overly sweet but just right.   I love small family run places. the staff here was friendly and moved quickly to keep up with the orders. The only problem will be not wanting to come here daily, otherwise this place could contribute to my potential obesity. The price is right and I can't wait to try more of delicious donuts and hopefully their tea or coffee on my next visit here.

I found New India Gate through a Yelp search. I was impressed by all the good reviews and decided I had to try it. My husband and I went last night on our date night. The restaurant is clean and modern looking. We were greeted by one of the owners (it's owned by 2 brothers).  The brothers were so personable and fun. They make you feel like you're an old friend and were always available for drink refills or for extra mint chutney!  We ordered a variety of food. We started with the vegetable snack plate that had a variety of deep fried yummy snacks. Very good and nicely seasoned. The goat curry is delicious. The goat meat is so tender and the sauce is yummy. We ordered the basmati rice which was light and fluffy. The shrimp korma.... I will sing the praises of this dish! The shrimp were fork tender and the gravy is the ultimate comfort food! Order the garlic naan so you can soak up all the goodness with it!  We were given a sample of the sweet mango lassi. It was thick and creamy. I could have downed a gallon of the stuff easy!  We opted for some dessert to round out our meal. We ordered the gulab jamun and the pistachio kulfi. The gulab jamun was good. A little more dense than I like. But the kulfi.... wow! It was so delicious! You HAVE to try it! We will definitely be back to try more of their food!
