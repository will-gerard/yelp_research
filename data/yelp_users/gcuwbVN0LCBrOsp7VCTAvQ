This place is, quite simply, amazing.  To start, the atmosphere is excellent, especially in front of the Robata grill, and is very upscale without being pretentious or snotty.  The drink selection is great, and unique: I had several of their "shochu infusions," and I would recommend them, especially the honey and the apple.  We shared several entrees over the course of the evening, including the blackened tomato salad, marinated pork chop, yuzu miso black cod, baked green tea custard, and the Raspberries and Lychee.  All were delicious, and I was surprised by how much I loved the cod.  In general, I tend to steer clear of fish entrees (not really a fan), but the black cod was possibly the best thing I've ever eaten.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.

I so wanted to like this place.  I've driven by it several times, and at night the mulitcolored lights and cute signage give it an intimate, urban-hip feel.  I will say that the staff is super friendly, and the service was very good.  But for me, when I eat out it's all about the food, and it was not that tasty.  It was cheap, for sure, but I've had cheap, delicious food before and this was not it.  I ordered the blackberry lemonade and their special burrito of the day, a chicken burrito with green chile.  The lemonade tasted like cotton candy, and it wasn't actually a drink; it was a slushy.  The chicken burrito was pretty dry, and was filled with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and what looked like kraft shredded cheese.  It's my fault for not asking what all came on the burrito, but I HATE shredded lettuce.  I had to struggle to find any green chile, and when I did, it didn't pack a lot of flavor.  I wish I could recommend it, but I probably won't eat there again.

Hands-down my favorite pizza place in the East Valley.  I have been going to Sourdough pizza for close to 15 years, and it is consistently delicious.  I grew up in Mesa, now live in Phoenix, but I make it a point to visit Sourdough Pizza when I am in the Mesa area.  The decor definitely leaves something to be desired, as they are in a stucco strip mall, and their interior probably has not been updated  all that much in the 15 years I've been there.  But I could care less when the food and prices are this good.

I LOVE this coffee shop!  I like to buy the coffee that I make at home from a local coffee shop, and I used to get my coffee from Lux.  I tried Lola's, though, and made the switch!  Some of the reviews that I read said that Lola's beans taste burnt, but I totally disagree.  The coffee, to me, is very robust, but has a great smooth finish.  I like Lux's coffee, but I think I like Lola's better.    Besides buying my beans for home from here, I like to stop in on the weekend and have a latte.  I've had a great experience every time I come, and they have delicious pastries in addition to the coffee.  The atmosphere is also top-notch: they keep a variety of interesting magazines/newspapers available, have free Wifi, and the space is very light and open.  In addition, the crowd that comes here seems very laid-back and nice.  It's everything I would want in a coffee shop.
