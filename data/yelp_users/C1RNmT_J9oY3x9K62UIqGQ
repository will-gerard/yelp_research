I've been taking my son to V's for years...he loves it, always leaves feeling pampered and refreshed. Ariel comes highly recommended.

Unsanitary. Food was a disappointment but not as bad the service.

Went last night my family. We have been there twice before a while back, I guess it is under new ownership. It was an awkward experience to say the least. They refused basic requests because they are trying to basically cut food costs. I heard the new owner tell the table next to us they couldn't substitute angel hair for linguini as their side pasta because they are trying to "streamline" the kitchen and staff. They had a couple basic requests as well that she refused and said to them "restaurants who do that shut down and I don't want to shut down". It was awkward to watch. A few mistakes from the server who was otherwise nice were also handled quite awkwardly. I just think the place used to be good but is having a hard time with chemistry and a new cheap owner. Place has gone downhill.

Great place! Best spin. Stephanie and Todd are my fav spin instructors. Candlelit yoga. Love. Cafe is awesome.

Best brunch in Tempe. Food is bomb. Large beer selection in addition to their own brews. Friendly, laid back staff.

Great service. I've been doing the SNS nails the past 3 months. Nothing holds up better.
