$10.49 for a breakfast burrito with no sides and served on a small bed of iceberg lettuce. The service was about as lame as the prices. We had to go to Taco Bell afterward because we were still hungry. Sad but true.

The staff was friendly and the food was great. Good enough for me.

Best burger I've had in a long time. There are lots of killer toppings as well.
