Their green chicken enchiladas are outstanding, as are their chiles rellenos and tongue tacos. Not a fan of their grilled meat platters, as it seemed over cooked and under seasoned. But oh, those enchiladas... WOW!

No. Just... NO.  I was in a hurry and remembered something about el Nopalito having 99 cent tacos. Awesome! No. Horrible. Epically horrible.  My server was sweet, but as I was waiting for my food, I couldn't help but notice a sour smell. I couldn't figure out where it was coming from, so I thought, oh, maybe it's the guy at the next table. As I munched on the free chips and salsa (yay!) I noticed they both tasted odd. Not like they were going to make me sick, but just.. something was off about them. The red salsa literally tasted like tamarind (love tamarind, but not in my salsa) and the green salsa had an almost cheesy flavor (like cotija).  And then came my tacos. 99 cents each. They were so bad, I couldn't even force myself to finish them. The asada was in big, tough pieces. Pastor was literally chunks of ground pork. Green chile beef was practically inedible. The seasoning was so off on everything, and the salsas they provided just made it worse. As I was trying to choke it down anyway, I noticed a sour smell coming off the plate my tacos were on. Nah, it couldn't be, I thought. Then I smelled the plate. OMFG. No... No... I can't.   Never again. Spare yourself. It's not worth it, even for 99 cent tacos!

Such a great place. Free veggies and ranch for kids, awesome pizza, and the best growler deals ever!

The salsa bar, the horchata, the veggie burrito, the fish burrito... SO GOOD. However, their tacos didn't do it for me (specifically the tortillas). Hey, can't win them all.

I wanted to give it a chance. Yelp told me it was great. Yelp steered me wrong. Oh so wrong. Have you people no taste buds? No dignity? No shame?  Let's start with the sour-faced cashier who evidently has never eaten Mexican food. I asked her if the chicken taco was like pollo asado, and she said "um, yeah." Evidently she lives in a world where pollo asado means shredded, stewed chicken. ...Huh?  We got a total of five different kinds of tacos, and before we tried each one, we thought "this has got to be better than the last one". Nope. Several of the tacos weren't even hot. Overall, this place was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had in recent memory.  Did I mention one of the salsas at the salsa bar seemed, uh, shall we say... "carbonated"? Yes, that means it was going bad. Not that it was that good to begin with.   The chips were edible and seasoned. That's the one positive thing I can say.
