This is DEFINITELY the GEM of all the Phoenix courses.....my son and I played here and absolutely loved it....it is a long course and the only negative thing is they a map of the course so you know where you are hitting to....but the shape of the course was spot on I felt like I was playing a championship course!

Been going here for almost 10 years...Frank retired but Roland, his son, didn't miss a beat!  I was recently hospitalized with severe headaches, vertigo, and blindness...they did 2 spinal taps and 7 MRI'S and came up with no answer...I went to Roland and told him what was going on and he took new x-rays of me and did some adjustments telling me to come back in 2 days.  After leaving I was already feeling different within the hour and the following day was the first morning I awoke without dizziness.  When I saw him next he showed me how my atlas was turned and pushing on my nerves, he adjusted me again and when I left within an hour I was feeling fantastic!  Better than I have I some time, you see I moved and unfortunately this cut my visits down significantly.  Doc thinks I should be back to norm by the end of next week...I can guarantee you...I will be keeping up on my visits after this!  Cannot thank Sinatra Chiropractic enough!

Been here 3x hoping that it may have just been the time of day or server but ALL 3x we went the service was horrible, bathrooms unusable and food just gross.  On our final visit both my wife and I were sick the rest of the night.  Approach with caution... you have been warned!!

We uses to live just around the block from this place and enjoyed meals, as well as margaritas, here quite often.  We were back on this side of town and decided to call some friends to meet us for a bite.  We were sat immediately and the staff has ALWAYS been great and today was no exception!  We were taken care of by Chris and he did a phenomenal job! Our drinks never went empty, the chips and salsa remained full and he was always there with a smile and questioning if there was anything we needed.  The food was even better than I remembered and I can forsee my wife asking to go back soon just by how much she enjoyed her meal.  It is very reasonably priced and you never leave hungry!  Our friends hadn't been here in quite awhile either and they commented as we were leaving..."why don't we ever think of coming here ourselves?"  (I think they will be back soon as well ;) )

My daughter attended camp here for introductory to veterinary medicine and she had a blast!  She is looking forward to her second week of advanced medicine. The staff here has been incredible, welcoming, friendly and very informative. She was so excited to go everyday and was always excited getting up and ready in the morning. She was ecstatic about being able to hold and learn more about the animals that get rescued on a daily basis by the SPCA. She came home on a daily basis sharing the events of the day and the information she learned about the animals of the day.  She was able to do some dissecting and view a couple operations.  My wife and I were very excited seeing her enthusiasm at the end of each day and we felt like we made the right decision sending her to this camp!

I first came to Shane Co over 15 years ago and have been making all my jewelry purchases here ever since. I was buying an engagement ring, nothing extravagant, and was treated like royalty.  I was on a VERY modest income and had a budget to match, but I still felt as tho I mattered and respected. Now that I am fairing a little better I am so happy they offer the availability to upgrade while maintaining the value of the current set.  Not only did I upgrade but I bought a wedding band as well, my wife was floored!  I love the maintenance they include free of charge always keeping the rings looking their best!  One of the perks to the maintenance is sizing, which I needed after gaining all the love lbs over the course of the marriage!  I thoroughly enjoy being here because I feel welcomed just as family!  Of course ALWAYS with a brilliant smile by their reps! BRAVO Shane Co, BRAVO!!

We enjoy coming here with our dog on a hot summer day...they give him a dog treat!  We have gone thru other DQ's but when we ask for a dog treat they say no.  :(  The staff is always vibrant, energetic and friendly...they make you happy just driving thru!!!  We now make sure whenever we go for a ride with our pup we make sure we stop in here for a treat for the WHOLE fam!

This was our 2nd time in this week....the 1st time we were shuffled between 4 different people and our order was in all disarray because of it but it was out of the "norm" today we wanted some soup and decided to give it another shot....we walked in and waited to get seated 2 of the workers looked right at us, didn't acknowledge us and we never got seated!!!  We gave it a FULL 5 minutes and 2 other employees glanced our way but never said anything to us!!!  We wound up walking out and have now vowed not to give it ano thing er chance....we are sad because we loved their food but I guess this location doesn't care too much about their customer service...do yourself a favor make sure you pack your patience....

I would have given them 5 but I have a pup and the waiting area was VERY crowded and there were some aggressive dogs which the owners showed no concern about restraining them.  But the staff and the doctors were awesome and I have been there twice so far and both times they were fantastic...I will say the second time we went we were brought back to a room almost immediately avoiding the "crowd"

We returned this evening to enjoy another beautifully prepared steak....we were hoping to sit in Sam's section but the open seating was in the bar...we were served by Jake and he was good!  We were served fairly quickly and we were happy because it IS snowbird season here, you can tell by the traffic.  :/  Our steaks were phenomenal as well as our sides...we topped it off with cheesecake but the girls ordered hot fudge and ate it all without any cake!  Hope to be back shortly!

We FINALLY got great service!  We have been here approximately a dozen times due to circumstances beyond our control....but we went in on Tuesday for appetizers and trivia and were lucky to be waited on by Jessica.  She was AWESOME!!  It seems like all the previous times we went our service was HORREDOUS!!  This time was great and we will be back on either a Monday or Tuesday to see Jessica again!

I sat at the bar and ordered the Reuben based on Denise's recommendation...I was very satisfied with the sandwich however the fries tasted like they were reheated in a microwave....and they looked so good too!  I love my fries crispy and that's how they appeared but once I picked them up it was a whole different story!  Denise's service was phenomenal and was johnny-on-the-spot if I needed anything.  I will be back but next time I will have to try a different side...  :/

Went here because all of us were craving different things and I now wish we all could have agreed on something...it was not an enjoyable meal.  I tried a variety of different foods...fried chicken, meatloaf, pizza, veggies, and a few helpings of chocolate pudding (the highlight of my meal). My wife had roast beef, mashed potatoes and tacos...she enjoyed the roast but the rest was less than inspiring.  My daughter had a plate of "children's dishes" ie mac n cheese, pizza, and other finger food...and of course dessert. We were all happy with our desserts but we're left wanting when it came to our meals...needless to say it wasn't worth giving it a 3rd opportunity.  I just couldn't believe how packed this place was, especially since we had to ask the staff to refill several things we had wished to try.  There was one staff member, I wish I had retrieved her name, that was phenomenal and attentive I feel horrible for not getting her name to give her the props she deserves. She and the dessert were the highlights of the meal.

This may not be the prettiest course around but it's shortcomings are made up by their awesome friendly staff who go out of their way to ensure fairness and a good time for all.  I had the pleasure of dealing with Jason on more than one occasion and he was terrific with my daughter who is just learning to play....and on another occasion I was overcharged and was visited on the course to bring me a refund...these guys are great!!!!

I have to applaud whoever does the hiring, they have assembled a fantastic set of friendly and outgoing kids.  My niece works for a theatre back east and all they are concerned with is socializing while on the clock!  The rest rooms are always clean and the staff deserves a lot of kudos cleaning up after these piggy patrons!  I swear I am mortified when I exit to see how people just leave their trash since there us a cleanup crew!  Hate to see their homes! SMH. We definitely are here a lot 3x a month on average my wife and daughter aren't ones to "wait for it on Netflix" and let's face it there are 3D worthy out there....that's a must!  Professionalism is displayed from first contact, ticket sales all thru to exit when they are smiling saying...."thanks for coming!"  The only reason for 4 stars is snack pricing...  :/

We have been to this location 3 times and NEVER again!  The service is ALWAYS horrendous and trying to get a refill on ur coffee is like pulling teeth!  Next time I feel like IHOP I will make the drive to another location....ugh. the ONLY reason it gets the 2 stars is because I enjoy the food!

This is our first time at a Rubio's and found out it is quite great!  Very refreshing I had the sea bass tacos and a cerveza, Ballast Point (awesome!), the crew was great and attentive.  The food tasted very fresh and seasoned perfect!  We found an awesome place for lunch!  Thanks Aubrey for making our first time a great time!

I have the same dish everytime we come because it is so good, chicken picatta, and I enjoy a martini with dinner, Bombay Sapphire and Titos. Yes gin AND vodka, I order this everywhere I go and never have had the problems I have here....I have tried on more than 5 different visits and all 5 times I was charges differently.  The first time I came was 9$ fine...the 2nd time was 25$!!!....the 3rd time was 18$, then 16$ and finally 12$...  Each visit I asked for a manager to get my bill straight the 25$ excuse was the put it in as 2 called drinks..  WHAT????  The 18$ was "input wrong", and the last time when I was charged 12$ I was told 12$ is the right price because they charge 1$ per Bleu Cheese olive!!!  OMG!!!  I have been ordering this drink for pretty much my entire adult life with 3 bleu cheese olives and have NEVER been charged extra and they aren't even hand stuffed!!!  I have had the bartenders offer to make them for me in places that don't normally have them and they receive a great reward in the terms of their tip...I don't get charged extra!!!  The time when the manager told me the drink was 12 due to the olives I said I was very upset and would not be back, all he said was "sorry to hear that"  and walked away.... really made us feel wanted!!  The food and service is almost always on point and that's why we love it here but they need to be all on the same page when it comes to the charges!!!  Maybe appreciate the customers a little more as well...we are spending a small fortune for the short time we spend in your establishment!

My son and I stopped in to grab a bite after some golf.  Katie was waiting for us with a warm smile, exuberant personality and some great patience!  We both knew what WE wanted however I was going to surprise my daughter with one and she likes almost nothing on it and I need to make sure I get it right...;)  Even though they were busy I never felt rushed or on the spot to get moving she let me fumble around as I built my daughter's burger, thanks for your patience Katie!!!  All the Whataburgers I have ever been in are immaculate and this was no exception, the staff always do a great job and always look forward to my next Monterey melt, burger not chicken (gross).

We are frequent guests of this restaurant for breakfast and always try to get waited on by Charity, she has our beverages ready as we walk in the door and the coffee cup is never empty.  Their food is delicious and the owner, Hal, walks around and checks on all the guests and is not above picking up the coffee pot and filling a coffee cups.  Their homeade puddings are the best!!!

I remember when they opened their doors 20 some odd years ago...people were stacked up waiting for hours!  Now??...you can walk right in and get your pick of tables.  After today's service... I might know why.  We sat in the bar and was waited on by Casey...the mighty one struck out this time!  My wife and daughter were never asked about refills, we watched as she paid a lot more attention to the young man sitting alone at the bar.  Next time we come we will be sure to ask for Taylor who has always been great!!!

Jackie showed up ready for Seamus right on time.  We told her of the concerns from previous groomers and she escorted him out to her van.  They emerged approximately 40 min later and he was smelling good and happy!  His nails were trimmed and his coat thinned...Jackie made short work of our big boy!  We will be using them regularly for him now...give em a call!!!  They do cats as well!!

Been coming here for years!  Doc Spiegal is very warm and friendly, he must have picked his staff in his own age because they are all fantastic!   Carmen is always right there with a great big smile on her face and a genuine welcome on her lips! I use Deb as my hygienist and she is very good with me paying close attention to my very sensitive teeth.  I cannot say enough about this office they are there for you in emergency situations and are empathetic to all your needs and even your financial situation.  Highly recommend!!

Played this course with my daughter and I   was mortified at the condition of this course...it was like an abandoned course that someone was collecting fees for!!  The range is in such disrepair it made me sick!  Had I NOT promised my daughter we would go out and play....I would have never stayed....btw did I mention this fiasco of a course cost $40 for a 10yr old and myself.  GROSSLY disappointed!!!!

Was told of this place from a friend and was sooooo happy we checked it out!  We had a short wait but as soon as our buts were in the seat we were asked what were we drinking!  Not just once but by everyone that walked by as they noticed we didn't have something, awesome!  The coffee is pretty good although we found the oj to be kind of watery.  The entire staff is johnny-on-the-spot for coffee refills and everyone was pleasant and fun.  Amber was our server and was awesome she was full of smiles and wonderful suggestions.  They were calling put the regulars by name and that is always great to see....we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and who knows...maybe one day they will know our name!!!

We just recently found this little gem and we are so glad we did!  When we first came in and was seated we were waited on by Missy and hit it off just like we were old friends...we picked her brain for me u favorites and trusted the norm...since then we have been back regularly and countless times and enjoyed everything we have tried on the menu, seems like we cannot go wrong!  We were introduced to the owner and she definitely has a knack for hiring, the entire staff has been phenomenal and the bussers are johnny-on-the-spot when it comes to your drinks, the refills, and any needs they can attend with...keep up the fantastic work Peoria Cafe Staff!  We cannot tell you how much we look forward to visiting!

This was our first time here after being told how good this place was...they have been here for 20 years so they must be doing something right!  This location is in a strip mall on the NE corner of 75th Ave and Cactus.  They have a couple other locations but this was the closest, we went into and although it wasn't a cozy restaurant feel it was very clean and the staff was very friendly.  We ordered the special of a pie plus 20 wings, we were happy to find boneless wings here.  The wings were good we ordered them hot and THEY WERE!  We like our pie well done so it is crisp on bottom and they made it to perfection...we loved the taste of the sauce so everything melded together quite well.  We left with our bellies full and found a great new place for a great pie!

If I could give this less than a star I would....I was talked into meeting some friends here who swear by this place and I left deathly I'll and barely made it home to spend the next hour of my life in the bathroom thinking I was dying.  I did not learn my lesson...I gave it another shot this time I gave up and asked for a refund, was denied... NEVER again!!!!

We used to live just up the street and pop in here whenever we had the craving for authentic and excellent home cooked Greek dishes.  George, the owner, always is quick witted and makes your dining experience unforgettable! Tonight I had the special, snapper with clam sauce, my wife had the mix trio, and George made my daughter a pita with chicken and cheese.  Before our meal we chose to start out with dolmathes, spanakopita, and saganaki....all were incredible and NOTHING was left to waste!  We were eating as if it were our last meal and that's just a testament to the incredible experience your mouth will delight in during your time spent here. We were excited to try their version of baklava, George describes it as baklava on crack, and it is!  It was delicious! We took a couple of sample bites and had to take it home for later and as we went to take our leave we said our goodbyes to George and his son Dimitri as though we were saying farewell to family.  Thanks for everything it was another unforgettable dining experience!

Our dishwasher broke!  We always like to shop local to keep the $$ circulating here so we came in to check things out here after reading a lot of consumer feedback on both brands and Spencer's.  When we arrived everything was clean and bright and we were allowed to peruse at our own pace and alone, no tag along sales peeps.  When we started to ask our questions the rep asked some questions and then gave us feedback and insights.  He informed us of some specials they had and and provided us with model numbers so we could do our due diligence and read up on them.  We went home and researched what we were shown and after careful consideration we decided to take the salesman's advice and buy one that they had on close out.  He saved us a bunch and we still managed to get a top rated unit!

I don't know WHY I am giving it 2 stars...I was so sick shortly after and into the next day.  However we did have great service and that's why I felt I had to give them that.  I had a burger and some tots, it didn't taste too bad but the after effects was the worst!  My daughter, who didn't have a burger, was also having stomach problems.  I think my wife's stomach is made of iron...she was fine.  We wanted something fast since we were seeing a movie and didn't have time for a sit down meal.  So needless to say we won't be trying it out again.

These guys are great!  Being from back east I am a pizza snob and this is a good pie!  When we moved from central Phoenix out here we found ballpark thru Google and have been a regular ever since, wish they had a punch card lol.  The staff is over the top friendly and always making sure the guests are happy, if you decide to eat it, I take out.  The seating is set up like being at a little park and dug out...pretty cool.  They have beer on tap and bottles as well as soda.  For you beer snobs that have to have tap, this place is limited but they do have Sam Adams!  It's always a happy dinner night when I say I am picking ballpark...keep up the good work guys!

Being a pizza snob and feeling like I come from where they make the best pizza in the country, NYC, this place is a travesty. I gave it a shot based on reviews from in laws and coworkers...guess they have never had great pizza.  I understand that this is also the choice of my daughters school when they have pizza day...when I asked her what she thought of it her reply was, "I'd rather have a Totino's frozen pizza!" (Enough said)  For all you pizza lovers out there....my advice to you would be to steer clear of this place.

This was our first time here and we will be back!  Yes it is a mostly older crowd but you are in Sun City!  Thoroughly enjoyed listening to the live renditions of all my favorite 50's artists such as Louie Prima, Sinatra and of course Dean Martin!  The food was excellent as well as the service!  Zach was our server and was Johnny on the spot if we were in need of anything!  We were a little weary before we went because of all the mixed reviews on here but we had a great time!  The ONLY draw back was the calimari...I found it a little too chewy....but there HAD to be a glitch...right!  Be back soon!

Again we came to take our chances on service and capped out!  The entire dining room was open however we had a 10 min wait because we were only 2 and those were reserved for larger parties....it always seems to be that when Heather manages this takes place...our server Cathy left something to be desired....thank God the food was good!

My wife and children splurged on me for father's day and brought me here knowing how much I love it.  We were sat immediately which anyone who knows this place is a miracle!  ....we were thrilled!  The place was buzzing with people being sat and I heard each of the wait staff we passed say happy Father's day when we were greeted by our waitress, Ashly, not even as much as a welcome to Pappadeauxs....  We ordered our drinks and when my martini was served it look half full so my wife asked in a comical way where the rest of it was and if looks could kill...she would have been vaporized!  We are a very comical family and when we go out, which is usually limited to special times or celebrations, we lime to have fun and Ashly wasn't having any part of it.  She was strictly business and throughout the entire meal we never got as much as a smile.  We had a heck a time getting her attention whenever we needed refills or any service.  We cannot complain of the food but we were VERY disheartened by the service we received and if we choose to spend our next special night out Pappadeauxs we will make sure we are not being waited on by Ashly.

We came here after we walked out of another establishment for not waiting on us....we now think it was by the grace of God!  We were waited on by Kaylie and could not be more happy with this little gal!  She was courteous, friendly, funny, professional, and quick witted!  When we were seated our drink order was promptly taken by another server who apologized for Kaylie who was waiting on a large group, we were dumfounded by how quickly he was at our table!  Kaylie was not far behind and scooped up our order and we were feasting in no time!  She came back and retrieved our dessert order and we rolled out shortly after!  I would highly recommend CB and if you do choose to stop in...ask for Kaylie!

I have been told there really is a huge difference between gas, however does it mean they should get almost 80 cents a gallon more for it?  The customer service is VERY hit or miss here I have had great and the WORST ever here...I normally only go in for lottery tickets and you would think they would be happy to sell them since they get $$$ if you win!  I have found a new place to play, if I hit sorry Chevron!

I only give it 1 star because I have to give it something!  Went here with friends and the we were 1 of 5 tables and the service was so deplorable. We should have known it wasnt going to be good from the stench of the place as we walked up to it from the parking lot. The place was just plain filthy as well...the tables were gross and sticky and the bathrooms were too disgusting to even enter.  My wife and friends were alot braver than I was and they ordered and ate appetizers I had a beer...bottled!  Later that day my wife was soon sick with diarrhea and vomiting she thought she was gonna die. I live close by this place and it BAFFLES me how they stay in business but they manage  to stay busy especially  being so close to the Spring training  facilities.  I know it can't be from REPEAT business! Certainly won't be from us!

OMG.....we came here again because our friends are STRONG supporters of the Scottsdale location and they refused to believe us on just how horrible this place is!  We walk in and the smell is like a punch in the face!  C'mon man this is winter it shouldn't smell this ba d unless you REALLY have problems!  The wife and I sat back and let them take lead...they let the waitress know how they were regulars over in Scottsdale and she almost had a sneer on her face but we got out drinks and they were appalled! The Marguerita he ordered was undrinkable and that's his fave....the waitress said, "that's how we make them here"....WHAT????  We will not be back nor our friends....they had to see it for themselves!!!  Friendly warning...DON'T EAT HERE!!!!

Maybe I am just bias but whenever I come here I feel as though the workers are just going thru the motions there is no friendliness or gratitude you chose to come here for a movie...I mean shouldn't there be?  We are paying a lot of $ not only for the entrance but the snacks as well!  The cleanliness leaves something to be desired....especially the bathrooms...the soap only had one dispenser that had anything in it.  We were on this side of town and decided to catch a movie before heading home trying to avoid rush hour...we should have just sat in traffic!  Don't count on my return.

Although I have only the 1 check in here we have been here numerous times and have NEVER been disappointed! The staff is always great and quick with the coffee refills! (My kinda place)  The servings are plenty you will most definitely not leave hungry!  I bounce all over the place when it comes to ordering sometimes breakfast, other times lunch!  Today was a Philly sandwich day and it was absolutely delectable! The prices are very fair and my suggestion is to bring patience because this place is ALWAYS busy and normally a 10-15 min wait, more on Sundays.  Well worth the trip and the wait, to coin a phrase by another restaurant....when you're here, you're family!  ;)

The food was very good I had the  garlic chicken house specialty...I also had an egg roll and hot & sour soup.  We were waited on by a new waitress and we tried to be as patient as possible but we never got refills on our water or soup until we flagged down the busser...this was the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars...we watched as it appeared to be 3 new servers running around as the manager decided to sit back and never get involved...why?

This place has some great pieces in it, but just like most consignment stores they seem to take in too much so it is very hard to take in everything they have very congested.  They are right there to help you if you find something, the service is right on point. This place seems to take in "higher end" items than a lot of other such stores.  Their prices are fair based on what they offer like the saying goes, you get what you pay for.

My wife, daughter and myself shop here quite often, we always find such great unique items to adorn our house with.  One of the great things I love is how easy it is to use coupons right from the phone and that they allow you to share this with the other customers who have no phone with them or don't have a smart phone.  The staff has always been very friendly and helpful, when we have to ask questions they have been very knowledgeable about the products and if the first person cannot answer our question, they are quick to find someone who can! We are quick to go to their close out aisle where you can get great bargains on hugely marked down items, we have purchased a lot of our outdoor decorations in this fashion.   My wife loves to paint, whenever time allows, and Hobby Lobby allows her to stock up on her supplies without breaking the bank.

The food wasnt bad...my wife has been trying to get me to bring her to a fondue place so I figured I would surprise her and take her for lunch, she was excited but that was quickly dashed when she watched her lunch HOUR fade out without getting her meal so she asked for a to go tea and was told they don't carry to go cups..WHAT???   After all this and the OWNER knowing it was our first time, she never offered ANY apologies or discounts for not getting us served in time,  I left out that we were 1 of 4 tables... so what could the excuse been??

We have eaten here a couple times now, the first time we sat at the counter and struggled getting our coffee refilled...the staff made more of a point socializing than tending to customers, but the food was good.   After a few weeks we came back for a second try....there were four tables of two or less and a couple people at the counter, AGAIN trying to get your coffee refilled was ridiculous!!  The waitress even answered her cell and stepped outside while we were waiting on service...WORST of all this was right in front of the owner!!!   They won't get a chance on a third strike and it's a shame cause I LOVED the omelette!  If you have all the time in the world eat here...just read the other reviews as well.

I don't know what it is with the Dunkin out here compared to back east...but you just can't guarantee you are going to get the same tasting coffee daily as you are back there.  I have been to NUMEROUS locations out here and have experienced the same thing, not sure exactly what it is.  In saying that I found this particular location to be the most consistent at mak I ng a good cup and as well as having the most friendly staff.  They have a lot of regulars that come and enjoy each others company and that is great to see.  I have made this my regular stop when I am out and about and need a quick pick me up or a good dose of caffeine!  Served with a thank you and a smile!

It was our first time here and we're very welcomed by Marty who served up an amazing lunch and dining experience! A very quaint place with amazing dishes! The meatballs were outstanding!

My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here and they truly made it special.  We were greeted with smiles and a warm happy anniversary then brought over to our table which was delicately covered with rose petals and a card saying happy anniversary and signed by the staff.  We sat in the lounge so we could enjoy the silky smooth voice of The Talia Hendrix Trio, they were unforgettable!  The meal was beyond compare...I had the sea bass and it made my taste buds dance!  My wife had the African lobster which was over a pound!  She was in heaven!  I ordered a side of beets which my wife took most of, they were phenomenal!  I cannot thank Eddie V's for making our night so special...we look forward to our return!

This is our third time here and we could not ask for better service!   The food is VERY reasonable and delicious!   Coffee is good and bottomless OJ!!!!  We had Trent and he was fantastic! Melissa, the manager, came by numerous times to ensure everything was ok...was a very pleasurable breakfast!

The items get picked over pretty quick at this location almost as if the regulars are on a call list!  There are still some treasures to find so go in and take a shot at finding a gem!  The staff I found to be about as much help as other Goodwills, they do enough to just stay employed, I guess.  But it's not like I am at the Scottsdale Fashion Mall so I can't complain too much!   ;P

We were lucky to pull up and find a break in the crowd and get into eat.  We were sat immediately and Callie took our drink order, she was very bubbly, friendly and has a very quick wit!  I felt like we were among family with the way we were able to banter with Callie and how we got along so stellar.  She had some great recommendations which I adhered to and I don't regret it!  I went with the shrimp pizza, it was fantastic!   Of course I had to start with the meatballs, that is always a must!  The pizza is supposed to come with red pepper flakes, I passed on those, but there is a sweetness to the pie from the basil and it really makes it grand!  So give it a shot and when you get there ask for Alvernon, aka Callie, tell her Joe sent ya!!  You won't be disappointed!

Been coming here for 2 years now and Perry sure cures what ails ya!  I first saw him when I was in debilitating back pain on way home from ER where they did NOTHING! I had to use a walker to get into Perry's treatment room and was carrying it when I left!!!  I was pain free!  I followed up a couple more times and was right as reign!  He has performed his miracles on me several test for headaches, colds, allergies and other body aches/pains.  I HIGHLY recommend him and when you come in...tell him Joe from Yelp sent ya!

We once again received STELLAR service from April.  She is phenomenal!  She took the time to make me bleu cheese olives for my martini and I could not be more appreciative.  The families meal was beyond delicious, I had the salmon and the veggies were so good my daughter ate some! (Not much of a veggie gal)  The zucchini is Australia to start, beautifully breaded and very moist!  Looking forward to our return!  Thanks again April!!!

My wife and I were looking to switch carriers and drove up to check out T mobile....we wouldn't eve go close because 3 of their employees were smoking right outside the door and we felt like throwing up from the cloud that engulfed the doorway. ...off to find somewhere that you don't go thru a smoke cloud to do business

I have been giving blood for MANY years and found this location not only to be the most friendliest but most efficient as well!  You are always greeted with a smile and a genuine thank you for the donation and possibly, for the regulars, even some quick comedic banter! The reason I chose to withhold a star has nothing to do with this facility or the personnel representing it but because of UBS'S decision to cut back on all the good snacks and all the juices.  They offer strictly water now and there are no snacks left that I care for at all...they want you to keep coming back but they choose to cut THAT part out of the budget??!!!  I will continue to go unless I find some place else that is just as friendly and offer better goodies!

I have shopped here a few times and always found the staff very friendly and helpful.  The space is quite tight there is definitely not a whole lot of room to move around not a place to bring your kids!  They offer a couple options to assist you in your sale, if it is a large item they have you provide them with pictures and they post them on their site and show them to customers that may come in to look for such items, but if it is an item they have room for they will take it in and display it proudly.  We have purchased some odds and ends here most recently a desk which worked out perfectly for our space and the price was right on target.  If your not sure what you are looking for pop in and you never know...you may just pick up something you never knew you needed / wanted!

Went to grab some dinner and was waited on by Ciara who was simply awesome!  She made excellent recommendations and very patient with us!  Then when we sat down and Kathleen brought us our dinner she noticed my daughter made a face at the potato salad and without hesitation asked if there was something else she could bring her....talk about OUTSTANDING service!   BTW. ...the food was delicious!

We love to come here because we are ALWAYS satisfied!   From the service to the menu choices and of course the food quality and bang for your buck!  The ONLY draw back for us...it's not close enough to our home!  ;p But ALWAYS worth the drive!

This place is so clean and enjoyable to walk into.  The vibrant colors and custom made furniture is really something else to behold AND it's comfortable!  We have always had excellent service and the food has always been delicious.   We have eaten here for lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch, always a hit!  Today I had the seafood chimi and it was real good, my daughter had her "go to" a bean and cheese burro, and the wife had a plain shredded beef chimi. I have to say as good as they are they serve a noticeably smaller portion than other Mexican food restaurants, but I didn't take off any for that because I was full when I left so the portion size has always been enough just not enough for leftovers.  I cannot have a lot of ice in my drinks, due to sensitive teeth, but I asked for very little ice on both my water and margarita but that didn't happen. Next time I will know to order without ice and steal some from my wife!

Even though we had a great time with the salesmen we interacted with, this rating was based on our overall experience.   We have been couch shopping for  2 years now because we are looking for something that we saw on TV but in a smaller version and we are determined not to settle.  We were originally being helped by Lane who was great at listening to what we wanted but we had to run home to measure once we found our couch.  When we went back to make the purchase Lane was not there and Mike helped us...we were still asking a ton of questions because we didn't want to have something a few months and then having to call for service.  I wasn't impressed with the quality of the answers I was receiving and at times felt like they were shady...why I didn't walk out was because the wife really like the sofa. It was made by Jackson, a brand I have never heard of, and we were reassured they are a company who has been around for quite sometime and also one of their best sellers. What we did next was so backwards of us, we purchased and THEN we looked up the company and customer reviews.  Needless to say the reviews  were HORRIBLE and so we decided we wanted to cancel. We were at the store until they closed the night before working on the order and we were there when the store opened the next morning to cancel.  We went to customer service and was never even asked why we wanted to cancel but then we were told we were going to charged 35$ because the sofa was already on the truck!  My wife said to the gal really? They have it on the truck from our order at 10 last night and it is 8 am?  Top it off it wasn't supposed to be delivered for 2 days!!!  She picked up the phone and spoke to whoever and refunded our $ and told us they would waive the 35$....don't think they had an option.  If you choose to buy here, do your homework FIRST!  BTW they don't have customer service support in the store once you purchase, they give you a phone number!

I have been here many times and every time have been fully satisfied.  Today I was served by Brad and asked him for well done Greek fries and they were perfect! The amount of meat they give you is enough to keep you fed for two meals!!!  The only problem I had was having to pay .50$ for refills...they should include at least one free.  My friend had the Greek salad and added the gyro meat and was only able to get thru one fourth of it before giving up!  Make sure you bring your appetite when you come here you won't be disappointed and you won't leave hungry!  Brad made sure our experience was phenomenal and he succeeded!  Tell Brad Joe sent ya!  Even if u don't,  you will be well taken care of!!!

We went to a farmers market and afterwards needed to grab a bite to eat, we walked down the quaint downtown street and stopped in at Pomo.  We had never been nor heard of it but were greeted with smiles and sat promptly.  Chris was our server and gave us great recommendations after he learned it was our first time here.  He gave us the low down on how the pizza was cooked as well as the fantastic options we had.  The food looked fantastic as we watched it come out get delivered to our neighboring tables...we were anxious!  It was well worth the wait and the portions were perfect!  Thanks Chris for the excellent service and recommendations!

We found this place off of Groupon...we shop at Pets mart all the time and never bothered looking around to see what was here.  The Groupon was for their 28" cheese pie so the family packed up and made the trek over to give it a shot...we were happy we did.  I made the mistake of asking for it well done because it is a rather thin crusted pie and it was a little too much.  With that being said it was a good tasting pie and we will be back.  We want to try a standard pie and the toppings so we look forward to the next time!

It was a new shop opening in the area an offering a cut at 11$!  So....I went!  I was sat with Joey and I was very happy...we had a great chat thru the cut and afterwards I received a lot of compliments on the cut...he'll my wife even liked it!  ;P.  I loved the fact they are practically walking distance from the house and that Joey does such a great cut.  The shop plays club music and is a very clean and inviting environment...there are like 12 chairs and no waiting, unless you want a particular stylist then you may want to call ahead.  This place is just a stones throw from another "trendy" shop that I have tried out but was no where near as satisfied as I was with Floyds.

They have been open just about a month and I finally got a chance to check it....hair had to grow!  When u go in u sign in on the computer and choose your stylist or first available if you don't care.  Decorated like a man cave, tv's everywhere and sports memorabilia adorning the walls.  The withing chairs were very comfortable for the short time I waited...there were 4 stylists working and I was lucky enough to fall into Liz's open chair.  She greeted me with a fabulous teethy radiant smile and escorted me to her chair.  We went thru the usual cut style and I went with their full package which was supposed alpassage, wash and cut...26$  if you just want a cut..12$!!!!!  WHAT??!!!  Yes 12$!!!  I recommend the massage, I was putty in Liz's hands...it was amazing! I fell just shy of letting go a few snores..the cut was just what I wanted! To coin a phrase from the Governator... "I'll be back!"
