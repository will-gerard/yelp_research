Typically their soups are very good. I am not a vegetarian however I feel like their vegetarian soups are packed full of flavor. My all time favorite selection is the chopped salad. Lunch and dinner are packed and can take a while to get food so be prepared.

Agreed, it is a dive bar BUT it has good food @ great pricing. If you feel like kicking back, it's a cool place to be. Live music on the weekend.

We had a really good time at their beer and food pairing dinner event. Food was delicious and beers were perfectly selected for each course. I would definitely attend another one in the future.

Randomly stopped by this place and was pleasantly surprised. Good ol fashion BBQ. Had pulled pork and coleslaw and the place was really clean.

Called 3 minutes to closing and was helped. The technician came to my rescue within 30 minutes. My daughter and I were locked out of our car. They were upfront with total out of pocket costs. Unlocking my car after hours was $65 which I found resonible. Quick, good and professional service. I would definitely use again.

Not a big fan of this car wash. I have been there 5 times because it is close to my house and have found A) the hassle to get out of the car to be tremendously annoying with the long, bullying of a sales pitch to either replacement my windshield or upgrade to detail my car B) service is below average and unorganized C) finished product is below average. Every time there was a blue product on the outside of my car, the car was not wiped down well at all and the inside was barely touched..... For what you pay, there value is just not there.

I have had both of my children at this hospital and absolutely enjoyed the experience with both. The labor and delivery and the postpartum nurses were great. Some better than others however all were professional and took care of me and my children.
