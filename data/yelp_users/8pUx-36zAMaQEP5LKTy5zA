I haven't been here in a long time and it was really good. The meatballs are my favorite and the customer service was excellent.

I was in need for a new dentist so I checked this one out. When I entered the office I was greeted very friendly by the staff. I didn't have to wait long and got a cleaning done. The hygienist was excellent and I didn't feel any discomfort. I also had my retainer cleaned that had a lot of plaque on it and it's good as new. Dr. B himself was very nice and explained things in a great way and even though I didn't have any major problems I could tell he cares about his patients. Probably one of the best dentist visits I've had. I have another appointment scheduled for another cleaning and exam in 6 months

Been going here since 2007 and I still love it! Best gym hands down especially with all the amenities.

If you go here, I would highly recommend requesting Ted Smith as your salesman. He is very easy to communicate with, listens to your needs, straight shooting, and not pushy. He helped us get to the deal we wanted and I was extremely happy he was our salesman. In the past, we've had many car buying experiences and this one ranks at the top. We've been very satisfied so far with the purchase and experience.

One of my favorite fish taco places! The staff is very friendly too! A little on the pricey side but it a great treat to have once in a while.

I went in for a free coffee thanks to the Arizona Cardinals victory on Sunday. When I go in, I also get a donut that I pay for. The costumer service was very disappointing to say the least. First off, I was waiting for my coffee for over 10 minutes and when I asked the guy where it was, he had forgotten to make it. To top it off, the lady who ran me up was giving me an attitude and being very rude to me. They were snappy and got upset when I asked for a water too. In the back while I was drinking my coffee with my friend, I overheard the staff shouting obscene things. Next time I want coffee, I'm taking my services elsewhere.
