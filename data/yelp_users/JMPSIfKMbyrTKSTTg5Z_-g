I don't normally review anything 1 star.... But I ordered the bourbon chicken and shrimp. Firstly the waiter brought my plate out and said "the cook forgot to drop the potatoes again with this meal so I will bring them out later". The shrimp had no seasoning and a few of them were still translucent. I noticed after I took a bite and the texture was off that they were undercooked. I let the waiter know and he said sorry I will have them drop more shrimp (the shrimp was piled on my chicken and the onions and mushrooms). Everything was touching. He didn't take my plate and expected me to eat it. I Took a bite of my chicken and it was stringy and over cooked and barely edible. About 20 min later (after my party had finished most of its food) the waiter brought out my potatoes, they had no seasoning and were basically a half plate of boiled, flavorless potatoes. He then brought out my shrimp making a joke "watch the cook probably burned them now". I wasn't expecting much but my raw food not being replaced and the unintentional three course meal with no offer for reparations or a real apology was pretty subpar.

I am a huge steak fan. I love eating it out and I love grilling it at home. however, a general disclaimer, I am not a food snob or overly picky. I have been told by multiple people that I "had to try Durrants". We ordered an old fashioned and oysters to start. (This is the reason i am giving this review two stars instead of one). The oysters Rockefeller were amazing and I highly recommend them! Also, I haven't had a good old fashioned since I moved to Arizona, and the bar tender really knew his bourbon and the drink was outstanding. Then we put our dinner order in.... I got the 18oz ribeye and my uncle got the bone in ribeye. I asked for Mac and cheese instead of soup and the same for a side. I was instead served clam chowder. My uncle is a huge chowder fan and was excited to try it. I let the slip up go and decided to go with it as well. It was like a bowl of salt with some clam on top. Our waiter noticed we didn't eat any of the chowder and we said politely it was salty, and nothing was done about it. Next the steak came out. We both asked for mid rare. My uncle was rare, mine was medium. Also, I am a salt-aholic. I am that guy who will eat steak with a salt shaker in my left hand to make sure every bite gets a portion. The steak came out to the table overly salty to my taste. Also, the cut of meat was flabby (not marbled as it should be, I understand it is supposed to be fatty, that's why I love ribeye). This was fatty in the "I bought the cheap one at Wal-Mart kinda way. For a 166 dollar bill, I will not be back.

The staff is extremely friendly and I have had chronic pain for about five years now. First place I have gone to that hasn't tried to get me to take steroid injections. After 3 visits my pain level has decreased by about 60 percent!

I am an avid Chipotle-er and I have been disappointed with this location on four separate visits! Dirty, slow line. One time the pico de gallo was so spicy I could barely eat it (and I like spicy!). They opened 10 minutes late one day and I spent my lunch break waiting for the doors to open... had to leave to make it back to work before I even got to order. During another visit, I waited five minutes for the fajitas to be made (they were close to raw!) on a Saturday around dinner time and watched the two people on the line bicker and mis-communicate through orders. The line stretched to the door. I was told the guacamole would take 20 minutes to make. No offer was made to make up for these shortcomings.

Wow. This was awesome. Food was top notch (duck burger was off the hook but a bit salty). The short rib tacos were a perfect flavor blend, and the jerky was delicious. However, the service was the best part of the experience. Ask for mike to make you a beer cocktail. I am a bit of a dabbler in trying different drinks and was very impressed with both his service and his drinks. Definitely will be back here!

Music was awesome! Drinks were overpriced enough that I gave this place a two. Maybe that's par for Scottsdale but I don't think 18 dollars for a captain and coke and a double red stag and coke is acceptable.

The service and beer selection at this location are great. Gary was our bartender and had a good knowledge of the beers on draft and the happy hour is phenomenal. Try the founders dirty bastard on tap.

Food was amazing and the service was fast. I will be coming back here again. I highly recommend the burger with the egg on it. (Angus beef, straight from a farm!) It is owner operated and Duc  and Noel were super friendly.

Liana is the best. I can't speak highly enough of her professionalism or the quality of her work. Her prices were right in line as well! My whole extended family has used her for years, and she will definitely be used by my immediate family for years to come!
