Tropical Fried Rice -- Amazing! They can substitute the chicken with Tofu which is perfect for us vegetarians, and the rice is just so addictive. You can't stop eating it. They don't overdo it or overcook the vegetables, and it's a perfectly balanced meal. I love everything about this place.  The owner, additionally, is very nice and very modest. You can barely tell that he runs one of the best thai places in downtown phoenix. Hands down, my favorite dinner option in central phx. You will come here and be impressed.

Attended this school from 6th grade through senior year. I credit every success I have in the professional world to what I learned here. Presentation skills, group organization, personal prescence, and still having fun with arts on the side.... what more could you ask for? I would send my children here, my grandchildren here, everyone. It takes a certain sort of driven child to succeed here, so any of the regular "coast through life" types need not apply. Work hard, Play hard, Succeed.

Really like the panko fish here. I've been coming here since the 6th grade, since I went to school right around the corner. I have ALWAYS loved it. They even made it through the lightrail constructions fiasco that ate up a lot of nearby businesses -- Blue Fin never fails. I hope I see this restaraunt around when I send my kids to school downtown, because they are consistent, they are incredibly friendly, and clean. It's nice to still feel like you're getting a home cooked meal from a neighbor, and you get that here.  Also -- they have red bean paste Mochi, for any interested. Just ask. It's tasty!

For being a gigantic venue, they really have their stuff together. All the staff know where everything is, management is helpful, and ticket scanners, seaters, and will call folks are all incredibly patient. Much love!

My friend ordered chicken nuggets, and two of them were molded together. I'm vegetarian, so I sat there with my crappy fries but tasty frosty and watched the madness unfold.  As she tore the two melded nuggets away from each other, THERE WAS A GELLY WHITE PASTE THAT DRIPPED OUT. I am literally gagging just recalling the incident, and I almost threw up all over the table.  This exact same scenario happened to my sister, on her totally different box of chicken nuggets 45 second later. Nobody finished our food. We all just left.  There is white gooey crap IN THE FOOD at wendys.   So incredibly gross. SO gross. Gross. Don't go here, for the love of god!!

The prices here are crap. Seriously. They overcharge like crazy for their items, and I can't really understand why. Pants from low-brand names are still running like $20 here... you may as well go to Ross and at least buy them new (although last season).   The attitude of the front-desk folk is obnoxious and so self-serving and judgemental. You don't even get looked at when you walk in, unless your a hot "hipter" type male dude, which I am not.   I tried on two dresses, both of which were a little tattered, over $15 dollars, and had the weirdest cuts and shapes ever (although the fabric was nice).  The jewelry sections is just pieces of wood strung together with a $14.00 pricetag.   Not going here again. Back to Ross/Rack/Last chance.

I have eaten..  EVERY. SINGLE. BRUSCHETTA. FLAVOR.  I plan to be buried with them. They are that good.  When i'm rich and famous one day, I will dine on nothing but Postino's bruschetta until I balloon and can no longer fit through my door and need to escape through the bay window to satiate my bruschetta needs.  That tasty.

Marianne at the front desk is a godsend. We had been walking around in the sun, trying to figure out what flowers and vegetable to buy for our garden. We're beginners,  we don't really know what we're doing, and it shows.   The first guy we talked to didn't really blow our socks away with his interest in our plight. We continued to roam, ended up at checkout, and there she was -- the gardener of the year! Marianne totally took care of us, helped us with fertilizer selection, and even drew a little diagram of the best way to set up our little garden to not overgrow any area. Apparently, mint is like a weed -- grows outta control! (who'da thought?)  Anyway, I came here on a recommendation from a friend, and I hope other people go here on recommendation from me. Wonderful place, huge selection, fantastic people.

Mango Habanero tacos. Amazing. The employees here saw that we were hungry, and they were slammed. I was so elated when they swung by and gave my boyfriend and I a total of 4 free meal coupons out of a thank you. A little patience goes a long way, and so does gratitude for your customers. Best Rubio's ever! :)

I am almost wanting to go and un-star places I have been before, because they pale in comparison to this place.  We got 4 orders of nigiri: Salmon, more salmon, tuna, and Salmon roe -- all of them were amazing. We also got a spicy tuna roll which was fresh and delicious, and eel roll which was tangy and delightful.  The sushi was SO FRESH, I couldn't believe it. The nigiri was powerful in it's simplicity, and the rolls were incredibly well constructed and  beautifully presented.   On top of that, the wait staff here really has their shit together -- like WHOA. Nobody missed a beat, everyone was helpful, and the sushi chef's were chopping and going through order tickets like wildfire, smiling the entire time. Some guy even bought them 4 bottles of sake for their great effort, and I know it was well deserved.  Amazing service.  Even better sushi.  $22 dollars. AAAAAH! I will eat here every day for the rest of my life!!!

The happy hour is amazing -- I wish the had a smoking section outside, but that's fine. I can deal with that.  I got $5 guacamole with chips first. When they say "made to order" they don't mean that you can customize your guacamole but rather that when you order it, they make it (which I though was the assumption for all food, but whatever.)  Then, I got the $5 vegetarian quesadilla which was pretty good -- the mushrooms were a little weird, but otherwise it was tasty. Came with sour cream and more guac, which was nice.  Bartender will give you samples of their beer, which is good. Both of their IPAs and very tasty, and one is particularly stong (10%ABV). I would highly recommend sitting at the bar, watching some baseball, and hanging out like I do.  Great place.

DALLAS! Oh, dallas. He's phenomenal.   Ever since I was a little girl learning english, I knew the Shane Co. commercials. On the classical station, then the oldies station, then 103.9 (back when it rocked), then 1047. Now on pandora. They followed me through all the years, and I never knew they were such a big company. They feel small, locally owned, and are totally on top of their game.  Speaking of awesome, Dallas is a pro. He called me, checked in, didn't fluster when I said the budget (also modest) and helped us through the whole thing. The experience, from start to finish, was worth telling all my friends about. I love shane co, I love them so much. Dallas too. Give that guy a raise.

Dear Fellow Taco Fanatics (and representatives of Rubio's):  I am a long-time vegetarian and have spent a lot of time and money going to Rubio's over the years. I'm also the girl that rants and raves about Rubio's and their perfect chips, amazing mango habanera sauce, and juicy limes. I absolutely adore that you responsibly source your fish, and that's just the best thing about you guys. Thank you. Here's where I have my beef (vegetarian pun included).  The Portobello Pablano taco (a.k.a. tastiest vegetarian treat ever) is GONE!  I went to visit the Rubio's in Scottsdale, Arizona. This particular Rubio's has the best people, wonderful management, and as I've mentioned already, very juicy limes. They literally sold me the last Portobello Pablano taco that they could make, since it was coming off of the menu. Talk about heart breaking.  I was wondering if we could maybe delve into why such a decision was made, as there are seemingly very little options for vegetarian food in the "Taco" sector of the food industry. Don't break my heart, Rubio's!  Sincerely,   A Vegetarian Taco Lover  (Don't read into that...)

Very nice home depot, even for Chandler. This is loads better than the only one I have available on Thomas and 40th Street, so I make do with what I got.  I came in for gardening supplies and found all sorts of shovels and picks for 88 cents, which was  a screaming deal. Got a hose for $5.00, and some weed killler, and called it a day. Quick service, got offered help out even though they were busy, and I would definitely come back.

Dr. Tymczyna has a difficult name, but is so easy to work with. She's very spunky and incredibly knowledgeable -- she knew all about some hypochromatosis, the ins and outs of hep C, what kind of vitamins to take for pre-pregnancy thoughts, AND she's an OBGYN! Their bloodwork comes back super quick, and they have a helpline you can call to get answers, rather than the bloody phone tag crap most doctors make you do. They are always always playing "I Love Lucy" in the waiting room.

I love this place. I had sourdough french toast with kiwi, strawberries, bananas, and blueberries with a side of eggs ($1.59 for an egg? Really? I can buy a dozen for that much!)  Anyway, pricy eggs aside, it was SO DELICIOUS. I ate the entire thing, even every last crumb of fruit. I loved it. It was reasonably priced, I got unlimited tea refills, and the server was just the cutest thing I've ever seen. It was like a very very nice and quaint version of denny's in terms of layout, not a lot of trendy indie stuff or whatever, but i loved it.

Pretty tasty, but for some reason they have the most squishy beans in the world. It's like... a muddy paste of beans, nothing like what the beans could have been. The shells were broken on my tacos, so I normally stick with Chalupas at this location. I'm a little ashamed just to admit to you guys that I go here. Vegetarian fast food options are limited. :(

Working with Rosemary is super easy. I came in with a very modest budget for flowers ($200) and we were able to work with it. Bridal bouquets, bridesmaids, and boutanneires. she's a pro, and I would highly recommend. Also! They are open late, which is AWESOME for people like me who work in Scottsdale and live downtown. Thanks guys! I'll report back again with photos once I get hitched ;)

Love the product, hate the customers in this area. I always get really really weirded out walking from my car all the way to the gas station inside, especially at night. I'm just lucky that at night it's so well lit, otherwise this would be extra shady.

It would be a one star review if the waitress wasn't trying exceptionally hard to be friendly.  We came to this restaraunt with about 10 people for a birthday party (which seems to be a trend these days... birthdays. Cut it out already, people! Every year!?) and we were quickly seated to a large table. We came here on a recommendation from a couple of friends that are vegetarian, as defined by eating cheese and rice dishes. Not your "tofu" or "tempeh" kind of vegetarian. We were going out on a limb already.  We got our orderd quickly taken away, and the tea was incredibly hot, but tasty and served in tiny little cups. The water took a lot longer than I had expected to be refilled, but it was a large table.   Then came the food. Bleh. I saw a review saying that "this is your grandfather's chinese place" and that couldn't be more right. It was like buffet style food in a restaraunt setting. Everything was overcooked and slimy, the bamboo shoots were clear and weird, the sprouts smelled a little strange. The crab puffs had NO crab in them, weren't really all that puffy, and contained the sick moist  nothing-but-cream-cheese filling I've learned to hate over the years. You can't really eat them without the cakey dough like texture getting all in your mouth and tainting your next bite.  Boyfriend got a Bao Po platter (something like Pu Pu, I'm assuming?) and I couldn't really eat any of it. The "Egg roll" had chicken and pork, so that was out of the question. I ate some sticky rice just to get by.  The sweet and sour sauce ended up being gelatenous -- as in, we poked a fork or a wonton in it multiple times and NOTHING came out. Jello sauce. The deep fried shrimp looked like a deep fried seahorse. It was HUGE and in the shape of a horseshoe. We affectionately called it the shoe-horse all night.   I had a really good time here because I have friends with a good sense of humour, but this place tried very very hard to get me to have a bad time. Wouldn't go back unless I had already eaten.

I really like this place -- the event staffers are very nice and there is always a ton of parking.   I came here for the Scorpius show "Underwater" and it was breathtaking. The facility itself is nicely laid out with a small art gallery on the side and a lot of room for mingling both during intermission.  -1 star because of the consession stand, which doesn not take cards. My friend had to get $20 out for a $2 water, with a $3.50 fee at the ATM and a $3.50 fee at the bank. FOR WATER.  Anyway, it could have been easier to have a swipey card on the ipad thing, or something along those lines. Cash-only places just drive me up the wall.

Fantastic service.  They know you on a first  name basis, always ask about your life and know what you've talked about in the past, and the hygenist is pleasant and professional.   They take my insurance, which is rare, and give 110% to every client. I live in downtown phoenix and STILL travel all the way to chandler every 6 mo for a cleaning. Also, Dr. Steiner is pretty cute. (What?! It's a honest review!)

This is my least favorite venue in Arizona.   The security people are terrible, I've NEVER had to deal with that at any venue before. They make you take your shoes off, you can't bring in a backpack (even if it's tiny) but girls can bring in HUGE purses full of crap.   They "confiscate" pocket knives, sharp objects, pens, pill boxes, and... get this... Caribeaners. I have a caribeaner to keep my keys together, it's literally an inch long. Apparently this is the only place in phoenix where every concert goer is a potential ex-con, because that's definitely how we're treated.  Maybe for the hipster concerts with the indie stoner crowd, they could tune down the security compared to say, I dunno, some scary ass metal band.   Apparently, I could use that as brass knuckles during a concert and knock a person out. Their sodas are $4 and are served from a 2 liter bottle in a red solo cup with barely any ice. Their "drinking wristband" system is crap, because its right after the strip search line and it gets congested as hell.  Bathrooms are ALWAYS dirty, every single time. Half of the locks dont work. There's gum in the water fountain.  Its just a complete shitshow of management, but the bands still come here. Seriously, everyone. Go to crescent ballroom, you'll have a much better time. Rhythem room, even... Just play the CD in your car. It will be a better experience.

5 stars for the food, service, and location. I love, love, love eating here. The spices are unlike anything I have ever eaten before, and it is absolutely addicting. Wonderful for children, vegetarians, families, parties, or getting together with your classier and hard to please food snobs.   The only reason I rated a 4 instead of a 5 is the sheer upset my stomach was in for 24 hours following the food. I know that over time, it will get better, but if you have a cautious or "not-withstanding of new spices" kind of digestive system, beware!

As a vegetarian, this place is AMAZING. As a person that loves cheese (sorry! I'm working on it)... the Mac and Cheese doesn't really meet the standards...  BUT! I can go out and enjoy incredibly tasty hot wings, and thats just the best thing ever. Their drinks are great, their crab puffs are super tasty, and the eggless rolls are great. I wish I could eat here daily for lunch.

I enjoy Casey Moores for what it is -- a place for young, music-friendly, super trendy people to get together, grab drinks, smoke a ton of cigarettes, and enjoy pretty tasty bar food.   It's better than the rest of the Mill Scene (no cover, ever!) and is a pretty large establishment. No crappy club music playing all over the place, and the entire outside is a smoking patio.  Recommendations: -Fish N Chips -Baked Oysters (it is an oyster house after all) -Beer specials  -Their burgers and fries are very very good.  Don't recommend: -Calamari (it has this super heavy breading and it tastes more like an onion ring than a seafood product) -Cold oysters on a place -- not as fresh as I'd like them, and a little grainy.

Coffee is still incredibly expensive. If I had unlimited disposable income, I would go. Atmosphere is wonderful as well, great place to take people who are new to downtown. Service is hit or miss -- barista lady's are either incredibly nice, or have way too much attitude. Open up another register, sometime? no?

We came here with a party of 15 people for a birthday. It was a tuesday, so it was almost empty for this GIANT bar with a stage, and the performers were starting to get set up.  I was ordering the food from a kind older waitress who was jottings things down on a napkin when I told her that my boyfriend and I were going to be on the same check.   "We don't do that here".  Okay, thats fine. I'll assumed I could take my receipt and his, and just pay for both. I mean, there's no way they were going to lump 25 people on the same bill, right? I mean.. we had like 10 couples and a bunch of kids. I got the food, which was okay, said happy birthday, and wanted to head out after being there for an hour or two.   I got my waitress, who seemed a bit over her head, and calmly asked for my bill so I could leave. She gave me a menu and said "Figure it out for yourself".   What. The. Hell.   Figure it out for myself? What was the point of a register? Do I look like an accountant? What are City of Scottsdale taxes here, anyway? Are we on a barter system? Why do I even have to pay anything at this point, if it is some free-for-all where I tell you how much my food was and you maybe/maybe not charge me?! Seriously.  I stood there, trying to talked to here, for 10 minutes and she just ignored me. Like in a bad movie, I was standing there, making eye contact, while another person who was supposed to be my server pretended I didn't even exist. Unbelievable. I was so furious, I almost lost it. I calculated it out, even though the cost of the drinks wasn't on the menu, and left. BAH!

I wish there were at least vegetarian substitutes for even one meal. I ended up with a side of mac n cheese, and a "vegetarian" pizza that looked like it was assembled by a child, and tasted like flour and regret. Not really satisifying. Not worth the money. The 10% off coupon with yelp was a redeeming quality, at least.

Came here when I was super duper sick, so I tried to get in and out real quick -- I got a lot of assistance from various people at the bar when I was getting my to go order. I'll make sure to check back when I get a chance to sit down and eat here -- My "coyboy scramble" was really tasty, and the coffee was okay. Would definitely come back.

Great place, very helpful.  Even when it's busy as hell, people always clear out at a rate that lets you grab a table by the time your food's ready. The cashiers are super friendly, quick, and nice. Everyone's always working, clearing tables, mopping, holding doors, wiping things down. I love this place.  Also, for vegetarians, get the Animal style Grilled Cheese. I used to think that the only thing I missed about meat-eating was In n Out burgers -- now I have no excuse. This place is bomb-diggity.  P.S. Milkshakes. Get one.

I used to live here when it was apartments, back before the 2008 bubble. I loved it, and it was a dream come true. Safe neighborhood, pet friendly, lovely layouts of the apartments, and BEAUTIFUL pool. I would have the best parties ever at this complex,  (quiet of course) and it was just amazing.  Then they bought us out, and turned the entire complex into condos. We couldn't afford it and had to move to north phoenix. I hope things are working out for them and for their residents -- I live back in my own home in Downtown now, thankfully... aside from the different paint, it still looks just as modern and sexy as ever.

I came in here sick as a dog for the first time, right as they opened. The pharmacy is very clean, tidy, and neatly organized. Comfortable seating while you wait is always nice, because you can't find that crap anywhere. Seriously. Try sitting in any store you go to these days. Geeze.   Anyway, I got my 4 prescriptions and they gave me verbal instructions and written ones and sent me on my way, including little coupons and fridge magnets to make sure I knew their name and to thank me for coming there.  The owners here are wonderful, and I don't even mind the 50's music!

I went in to get a clothing steamer. I asked for their opinion on the best ones, and the store clerk, "Jess", was amazing. The one on amazon was $74, it was $70 at walmart, and $64 at Bed Bath and Beyond! Cheaper than walmart? Sign me up.  I was talking about never having to iron again (I hope) and the cashier was super friendly and talkatie. She ended up throwing a coupon at me and gave me 20% off for no reason, which brought me down to $52 for a $75 product. Awesome.  Did I mention I threw away my iron? Clothing steamers are great. BB&B is better. Thanks guys!!

Came here at 9:00 for the pharmacy. Their house? 9:00 am. I was standing there, coughing my face out, with a prescription in hand. The pharmacist was just staring at me..... taunting me through the little bars. Apparently, according to his time zone, just three feet away, the pharmacy wasn't to open until he was done with whatever he was doing... which was staring at me and drinking his coffee. Boo.

Have gone to this place both for a small breakfast on an off day, and a mother's day brunch. Even though it was busier than heck, they had a great "buffet" breakfast thing for mothers day which was wonderful. you got a table, waited in line for food, and ate away (even seconds!) So delicious, and the service is always superb. Quaint little place, if only I was in Gilbert more often. :)

I love being able to get a slice of pizza whenever I feel, but I wish that they had a waitress that wasn't as condescending during the entire order process. Strictly transactional, doesn't really talk to you, and sends you off on your way with some fine vegetarian eats. I really love the food there, the salads even are amazing, and with better service, it would have been a 5 star. They should be lucky they don't work for tips!

I had a wonderful experience here. They have a table in the waiting room for filling out paperwork. That was awesome. (I'm easy to please, apparently).  The doctors and nurses were great, and sent me home with a free CD of my x-ray, rather than having to email it or charge me for it, which saved me $200 at the hand specialist. Thanks everyone! :)

Food portions were gigantic and flavorless. Service was absolutely despicable. The server was sitting there texting on her phone, charging me 3 dollars for hot water and a tea-bag, and I was just sitting there, staring out the bullet holes in the glass windows, wishing I could have gone to Wild Thaiger.

100th Review -- Very well deserved 5 starts goes to...  YEN SUSHI!  The happy hour here was amazing. We came here while waiting for a friend at the hospital and decided to grab sushi. We're used to great sushi in phoenix, tempe, scottsdale, etc. Never thought such tasty sushi could exist in Glendale, of all areas!  We sat outisde, which was nice, and were quickly served everything we could possibly ask for, promptly. They had nice chopsticks -- I remember these things. Anwyay, we always get eel rolls of some sort which were delicious. The edamame was tasty, the service was amazing, and the food was expertly made and fresh fresh fresh!  Would love to come back when I for some crazy reason end up on this side of town.

I come here every year, and I wish I could have seen the parade. The trick is to come on Saturday if you don't like crowds as much -- but some booths will be missing. we were looking for the massage people all day but to no avail. They have clean bathrooms, there's no trash on the floor, and everyone is so friendly and great.   It warms my heart to see big corporations there, and I especially like the anti-theistic booths. Sure, I like that accepting churches exist, but for the godless liberals among us, it's wonderful to find nonsecular coalitions, too.

Another amazing Freezy -- still love the food there, the checkout is easy, and the employees know where everything is all the time  (As they should, since the store is so small)  Unfortunately, I heard they were going out of business (the entire chain), so I am slowly distancing myself in order to not suffer too much once doors close.  ***update!***  Per wikipedia, "In February 2013 it was reported that despite rumors Tesco will not be selling or closing the chain."  WOHOO!!! More fruit for me!!!!! :)

Fantastic place. Amazing service, and they serve DOGFISHHEAD 120 MINUTE IPA! (when available). This place is the best of the best for coffee shop/beer selection. Tiny little historic home, very dear to my heart. I didn't think anything could replace the Willow House, but as I grew up, so did  my coffee tastes.

So much hype for such terrible results. Tacos were incredibly soggy, they had a lot of mismatched sauces that didn't compliment anything, and all of their meat is flavorless. Three tacos for 6 bucks is a deal, but I would rather go to Tacobell and get something crunchy and at least seasoned appropriately for the money. Not a lot of vegetarian options unless you like eating straight up cheese. Seriously, I would never go back.

It is exactly what you would expect from a Scottsdale bar. I had a pretty grumpy attitude going in, since this is so far away from my comfort zone it's not funny.   biggest pet peeve - The corn hole game they have going outside takes up the entire damn walkway, leaving us 'non players' with nowhere to walk around to get back inside after a smoke break.   I got hit in the back with a beanbag trying to navigate the patio.

She was very obviously new to the job, but we told her our names... she remembered them the entire time, and didn't even mind that 4 people came in for just 2 margaritas and a couple of sodas. They are sticklers about their 10pm start time for reverse happy hour, but otherwise... a great place to relax, unwind, and people watch.

Okay, so I've been back since and I've changed my mind. The food is still amazing, and the last time I went there, I got a different server and the service was wonderful... And there's always a ton of people who aren't the servers running around and making sure your happy. I had an endlessly full water cup, which was awesome cause it was seriously hot. Phoenix, man.  Anyway, I had the fish on special and it was peeeerfect. On top of some carrots that could use a little bit more cooking, but I think it had beets in it? As a russian, it's nice to see beets. I like beets. Love them. (God, I really hope it was beets!)  Seriously, they got their game in order. Go Gallo (pronounced Ga-yo). White cock. Hilarious! :)

I have noticed a lot of hospitals have moved over to 24/hour visiting hours. Especially when moms and dads have to sleep over, and still haven't had a break, it would be nice to extend those further a bit and allow everybody to get some rest.

I lived right behind this shop for 3 years. I would literally trust these guys with my life. I can't say that about most people, let alone a car mechanic. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful people.

Zeb Adams is my hero.  I had a very complicate home buying experience, just due to everything I was doing. I was selling a house in a shady neighborhood in Chandler, which he tried his hardest to do, while simultaneously living with a friend in Tempe and looking to buy a home in downtown Phoenix. This guy did it all.  I'm a little (very) controlling with big purchases and decisions, and Zeb was the kind of guy who could just talk you off of the ledge when things don't go your way. I could text him at 2am, he would text back. It was wonderful working with someone who was as technologically advanced as I was, because I maybe met him 4 times total over the course of 6 months.   I would recommend him to anyone, as he's just marvelous. I didn't really work with anyone else in the office, but I couldn't imagine them being any different. He patiently explained things to me (sometimes a few times), and pushed through all my drama and financing and the terrible treatment I had from other vendors.... who shall remain nameless (until I review them later, bwahaha)  Seriously, this guy is a pro. He know's what he's doing. Work with him.

It's a Del Taco, so just remember that going in. You can't really expect anything extraordinary, but this facility is pretty good.  Clean inside, clean and stocked restrooms, and fast service. They readily get you whatever you need both in the drive through and in person, so it's a quick, pleasant, and crunchy experience. Would definitely go back.

I lived next to this park for 3 years. Wonderfully safe for children, the jungle gym has been updated and shaded now, and in the summer when it rains like crazy, it creates a pretty little lake you can run paper-boats down, all old-school. It's huge!  Saw a lot of people playing disc golf here, and a few schools use it for soccor and things like that. I learned how to bike here!

Used to come here all the time to get groceries. I love their 99cent packs, but have a hard time finding a huge selection of vegetarian brands (easy frozen meals and such). Safeway offers more of the frozen foods I need, but for the days I want to spend in the kitche, "Freezy" is the best.

Ruth.... You have turned me into a blonde bombshell. There is nothing this lady can't do. I've been coming here since December, and every 8 weeks I am happy as a clam. We've been transitioning me from deep red to blonde (tough challenge), but she goes out on a limb and aces it every time. I've been getting compliments all week! I'm thinking of making my blue-haired sister drive all the way from Flagstaff for Ruth's amazing color correction... I'm sure she could figure something out! lol :) Thank you Ruth! You're amazing!

I was taking a nap when I heard a -clunkclunkclunkwhirrrr- sound coming out of my AC, and then it started to blow like a hair dryer, during 115 degree heat in an AZ summer. Great.  Lynn was the most highly recommended across all websites, I called him, and it felt like a family member had come over and cut me a deal. Super great to work with, such a great price. From breaking to COLD air again was less than 2 hours. THANK YOU LYNN!!!!!!

Hands down the most interesting hot dog I have ever eaten. Vegetarian dog with some kind of mango? SO GOOD! I wish I could follow them around and always have that kind of tasty option. Little pricey at $7 but not bad. Worth it, for sure.

The lady was very nice and very helpful. We talked over a wedding order and if I had a bigger budget, I would go with her. Unfortunately, I don't and I just cant justify spending that much per cupcake. Maybe for myself, but not for 100 guests.

Love their monthly package, and their service-men are all incredibly cute. Seriously. Every one of them. My mom commented on the incredibly suction of their hoses.  ANYWAY,   We came here, got the $5 wash, the car smelled great on the inside as the soap went through, and we came out spotless. I wish there was one north of the Interstate 10, but there isn't. I still drive all the way down here from 5th and indian school to get a car wash. Lovely place.  EDIT: when I wrote "as the soap went though", I didn't mean that soap got inside my car, lol... I meant that the wonderful aroma of the soap lingered for a few seconds, almost not warranting a car freshener.

Love them. Eli is a pro, and the yard looks very maintained, with no weeds. I pay $80 for monthly service, and to have the ability to pay with a link online which is awesome. I would prefer all vendors go this way... cash and checks are just totally out of the question for me (you can tell this for my snarky "cash only?" reviews...) On top of that,  the yard looks great!

24 HOUR CREPES ON THE WEEKENDS! The lemon! The powdered sugar! The hipster organic coffee and toddys!!  This is everything I want out of a coffee shop. Love you guys. A little condescending at times, and the female baristas don't seem to care much about anything, but to all the dudes working here, keep it up!

Advice to the owner: Creativity in your food is something that a lot of chef's aspire towards, but not a lot are able to execute. Case in point? Rice paper.  All of the staple food items are absolutely phenomenal. This includes the Pho, Firecracker Shrimp (addictive!) and most of the rolls. Here's where things get weird...  There was a roll I ordered (called the Buddha) that had the most foul smelling mushrooms I have ever eaten. I couldn't get through one bite without feeling nauseous. As a vegetarian, I have to put up with a lot of mushroom and strangely interesting food, but this took the cake. So bad tasting, I sent it back and ordered the other vegetarian roll (tempure asparagus) whick rocked.  The lady next to me attempted to also step outside her boundaries, ordered a jalapeno drink that was meant to have a tiny hint of spice. She couldn't get through one sip without her throat burning, and I could smell the peppers in her supposedly "sweet" margarita drink from my table.  So, stick with what you know and what you're good at, and keep the "culinary concoctions" off the menu.

Mark is incredible, and was the best choice when it came to getting a property manager. He seriously did everything! Got the renters, got their deposits, drafted forms, filed licenses, showed the property, listed it for sale to investors, and as requested, sold it for us!! We are so incredibly happy to have met him and had the opportunity to work with him.  The website is great and the auto-deposit of rent is flawless. He's incredibly flexible and patient, and never gave us any headache whatsoever (despite the complexity of our situation).  Great guy, wonderful manager, and I'm proud to now call him a friend. Thanks, Mark!!!

I came here strictly for the vegetarian panini.  I had one completely starving bite and though it wasn't that bad. Everything was downhill from there.  The panini was DRENCHED in oil, so every time you touched it you had to wipe your hands on a napkin. I  must have used 10. Seriously. Also, their "homemade" chips were also incredibly greasy.   This has never happened before, but I ate a completely vegetarian meal and felt like it was Thanksgiving and I felt like passing out. No good. No good at all.  It was the middle of a saturday, and it was totally empty as well. Not sure if this is just because of the Arizona Center, or what.. but I wouldn't go back.   I miss paradise already!

Very tasty vegan ice cream... tasted incredibly creamy, with a vanilla and coconut base. I loved it. I got the thin mint ice cream and I relished in every bite.  They also use wooden spoons, which are a weird dry texture on  your mouth, but still pretty neat.  Would definitely go back.

I love being able to get vegetarian hot wings. Now I have no reason to go back to meat.   As for the rest of the food, the chili is good, the mac n cheese is a little weird... but the crab puffs are tasty!  It's a litle hit or miss on some of the food items with regards to their 100% meat duplication, but nothing is bad on it's own without meat comparison.   I'd love to go back again!

Place was impeccably clean, but they were completely out of fresh fruit.. I'm talkin no peaches, no strawberries, blueberries, raspberries... which are the only toppings I get. I ended up getting sprinkles and oreos, but I really missed the fruit. :(  Their slideshow was fun, and the employees seemed happy. The location is AMAZING and very fun and open, so it's a fantastic place to go. Just keep 'dem fruits stocked up, ladies! :)

I've never finished a breakfast meal before. Here, every bite was wonderful. I can't really express how much I loved all the food, because it really is without comparison.  We came in on a fairly slow mid-morning, demanding breakfast 2 minutes before 11. The waiter, a wonderfully nice guy, told us it was fine. The owner, who has only owned the business for 15 months, came out and visited and asked us how the food was. The answer was simple - Totally kickass.  I am a vegetarian (on accident, after watching netflix documentaries), so I have a little bit picky tastes for my vege-food. I love flavour, taste, texture, etc. I had the tofu scrambler, with veggies, eggs, cheese, potatos, and an AMAZING sourdough and I ate Every. Last. Bite.   They sent us off with to-go coffees, without us even asking, and both the waiter and the owner were incredibly entertaining. I would go back in a heartbeat!

Service is excellent, showroom is beaitiful, and the changing rooms are just so freaking cute. Ladies are very helpful, and offer a lot of praise for you in every item you wear, but not a lot of constructive critisism. I'll leave that to my mom. She's a professional critique! :P

Just attended a wedding here, and the location was beautiful. Tiny little house on the inside, but two floors and so incredibly romantic. There wasn't anything out of place or too kitschy, which was a relief, and from the groom's point of view, it was priced at a very very good range.   It was a hipster wedding's dream come true.

Came in right as they opened on a Friday. Was seen immediately. Treated with both dignity and respect, which was more than I had for myself given the degree of my illness and the lack of slept I had. I was in and out in under 30 minutes. Incredible! The last urgent care I was at in Chandler took over 2 hours, so this was a nice breath of relief to come here and really feel  like I was being taken care of. Doctor answered all of my questions, wasn't condescending, and told me to come back if I didn't feel better in 48 hours. Luckily, I am. Thank you Dr. Nadine! :)

It's like a little hometown convenience store. Or.... a great prop to a zombie movie. You can come in here, get supplies, smokes, food, bandages.... and still survive the apocolypse for one more day!  Zombies aside, it's a wonderful little shop that's open pretty late especially on weekends when you need gum, an advil, or whatever. Right across the street from JoBot, and on weekends there is normally a totally rad guy playing guitar on the porch. Love it.

Great little jazz club! I can't wait until they have their liquor license, but until then you can BYOB. $5 to cork wine, and $1 per beer bottle so it's an added charge, but worth it. The jazz guys here are amazing, and its $10 a person, $5 for students. Keep that ASU card forever, ladies and gentlemen! This place is worth it.

We play ultimate frisbee here every Tuesday at 5, and it's a great place to get incredibly sore without having thousands of onlookers. Secluded behind a lot of office buildings, it's a pretty great park. Soccer, bathrooms, tennis, basketball, and dog trails. Great! :)

Love this place. "Drink Coffee, Do Good" is exactly what my mornings at work should be, but this place takes it to the next level. Giving back to the communities, especially those with a true need for fair pricing on their goods, is incredibly important and obviously at the heart of what they do.  Shane is awesome, and they really step up their game for First Fridays. Keep it up, everyone!

Dr. Lyon is amazing. I have been coming here for over 3 years whenever I have a problem (ex-dancer.. I have lots of problems!). He's always patient, has a wonderful massage staff that know their stuff, and I walk out sore, but better.   Also, his little box of starburst at the front desk is just delightful. You have to enjoy the small things, right?

Warning: TOO MUCH FROSTING.  Once, in the 5th grade, I had a party at the park. I had the biggest 90's kid cake you could ask for, and it had holy crap 90's frosting. I ate and end piece, and regretted it later when I was throwing up blue colored crap in the bushed of encanto park.  Since then, I can never understand charging $3.50 for ONE cupcake, when 75% of the cupcake is just frosting. I wish there was a 1.75 version which was just the cup-cake and a smaller layer of sprinkles or something. I really think you lose the taste in all the frosting.

Back in the good ol' meat eating days, this place was bomb-diggity. I love the custom burger option, and it's really wonderful to have a ton of different bread styles. That  might be my favorite part.   Unfortunately for me, I am fairly uncreative when I am left to my own devices, so they have some great specialty burgers to offer too. Deliciously addicting fries, zesty soda's, and top of the line service. Best "cheap burger" place, hands down.

I go here with my co-workers very often. It's near a strip of other businesses who are also wonderful, but nothing compares. I have only ever been to 1 other revolving sushi joint in AZ (also happened to be Teharu in Tempe), and I was incredibly impressed both times. I know it is a new place, but they already have a dedicated crowd of people and regulars. Great for kids, wonderful for colleagues, and all around perfect. Did I mention affordable!? What a treat.

I love walking into a place and being able to instantly shove food in my mouth without having to talk to another person. I get starving sometimes. These things happen. This restaurant is perfect for me.  Still wonderful sushi, and I come here often: Tip to the wise, you can ask for rolls specifically, like the rainbow roll or the dragon roll. They will make them, hand deliver them, and charge you the same. This goes for anything on the conveyer belt. Don't be afraid to ask!  And they scream, "irrashai" when you walk in. Roughly translated, that is Japanese for "welcome to the store".

This bar was terrible.   I came in on a friend's suggestion to go grab drinks and talk about where we're going for the weekend in San Diego. We sat ourselves, with a party of 6, and the entire bar was mostly empty. We waited for a while, and ended up making our own table.   The waitress came down, said she was sorry and she was caught up with another customer and that's why she couldn't come greet us. (Granted there were other waiters just hanging around, not doing anything. Could she have sent them?)  So we order food, and some beers. She wasn't sure of what they had on tap ,and referred us to the menu. My boyfriend and I hadn't eaten, and were planning to get bar food. I should have trusted the less than 3 stars this place got.   I ordered mini grilled cheese's for $1.00 each. Great deal for something that's essentially bread and "artisan" cheese. What did I get? A little, flat, half-dollar sized "sandwich" full of melted shredded cheese (Artisan!), on a wooden pallet. It took up maybe 10% of this giant pallet when I ordered two.   I decided to save myself with mini pizzas. Rather, they were tiny slices of over buttered bread, lathered in COLD pasta sauce... unmelted mozzarella cheese... and cold pepperoni. The pepperoni was unexpected, and not in a nice way. I'm a vegetarian. Faaantastic.  During this whole cheese / pepperoni fiasco, there was an older karaoke guy who was playing Midwestern music from the 70's. He was trying to get us to dance, and I'm trying just to figure out our whale-watching schedule in the back of the restaurant. We're there in the back of the restaurant for a reason! Anyway, he come over, and GRABS MY ARM to pull me up and dance with him to "I'm sexy and I know it." I had donated blood that day, bruised my arm, and at this point I was so hungry and grossed out I just snapped at him.  At this point, I went outside for a cigarette, to have an old bald man ask me to "light his fire"... and he was calling for me and my friend as we were walking to our car, asking us to stay and party with him.  NEVER. GOING. BACK. EVER.   p.s. Two TV's right next to each other were 10 seconds out of sync. OCD nightmare.   p.p.s. I swear I am normally such a happy person! Don't judge me! :P

Jeff Sparks is a completely amazing, profesisonal, guy. He came right after I called him, and he is totally on top of it. It was like $15 to get my door opened. He swung by, unlocked it, and chatted for a bit, and that was it! Easy as cake! I would definitely use him again, especially since theres no "after hours" charge.   Senior, Student, and Military discounts as well. Schweet.

If I could summarize the experience that I had with Primary Residential Mortgage's agent Jon Robinson, I would summarize it as such: The communication gap between us was not as much of a gap as a grand-canyon sized hole of failure, where everything I was told and promised fell into, burning in the wreckage like a failed Evil Kneivel stunt.   The house I was set on is perfect... I can't even begin to explain in all the ways I loved the home. Historic Downtown Phoenix property, completely remodeled, and a true gem among the other listings I had been looking at for 6 months prior. I was working with the Chandler, AZ branch of your office, specifically with Jon Robinson, as suggested by my realtor, Zeb Adams (who I can assure you may never refer a single person to Jon ever again.)   From the beginning, I told Jon Robinson what I was working with and laid the cards out: Single girl, cosigning with her married mother, including statements of the money in my bank account, residency status, my credit card debt, my cash savings, and that I was available 24/7 to take care of anything he needed. Jon's response was always a "Yeah, Mary. That's fine." I wouldn't have minded the sometimes condescending tone of support if it didn't end up being a mistake every single time that I called him.   Although Jon Robinson seemed like a nice guy and perhaps this may be a seriously steep learning curve, but my entire experience with the company has been BEYOND terrible. Maybe Jon has never written a loan before in his life. Maybe he is suffering through some extenuating family circumstances that are beyond my or his control. Maybe he doesn't even work for your company!   1)When the home insurance came back low, Jon told me he would have an insurance guy reach out to me and quote me a better rate. I went three days without an answer and eventually worked something out with my original home insurance guy, dropping it from $800 to $450  2) He suggested using my credit cards to hold myself over during the process. He didn't tell me once to not use my credit cards, and then when he re-ran my bank statements, told me I needed to pay EVERY SINGLE CARD down to zero, totaling over $6,000 off of my credit cards in order to be able to buy a house  3) 3 days later, after I was considering closing my IRA accounts, he told me I only needed to pay off $3,000, not the $6,000 he told me earlier. This left me in a state of furor since I had to tell half my family that everything would be okay, I didn't need it, my loan guy screwed up.  4) When I saved up all the cash to pay off the cards and deposited it into my account, he said that the money that I used to pay off the cards was not verifiable, when previously he told me not to worry about verification.  Unbeknownst to him, and apparently the entire mortgage staff, and literally 2 days before closing (Wednesday the 5th), he said my mother's assets were unverifiable and her almost $20,000 in paychecks in her checking account no longer were valid.   5) We were LITERALLY shaking hands at the new house, congratulating ourselves on a job well done, and we get a phone call. Jon had messed something up AGAIN! Something that neither I nor my realtor had any idea, but here's the briefest explanation I can create... It had something to do with a mortgage percentage changing, and legally I couldn't move into the house for 72 hours (Tuesday the 11th) which is now 6 DAYS after my initial closing date.  6) Literally the night before our new 6 days late closing date of Tuesday the 11th, I get a call from the title company. Apparently, Jon didn't note that my mom was married. Despite the forms we completed, the JOINT TAX RETURNS we filed and signed for, we had to have my dad come in the next day and notarize a form stating that he holds my mom not liable for whatever legal document. Keep in mind, my dad travels 11.5 months out of the year. He is literally home for 3 weeks a year, maximum. Had Jon caught this mistake earlier, my dad wouldn't have had to fill out any additional paperwork; Had Jon caught this 2 days later, my would have been across the country and out of reach for MONTHS.   You can at least understand the frustration and difficult I had to keep from crying when I received a survey in my inbox about my experience. I have literally lost 3 consecutive nights of sleep, and spend countless hours crying over spreadsheets, chain smoking menthol cigarettes, trying to make my finances and verification make sense, and living in a general state of panic and disarray since Jon wasn't doing anything proactively to make things work.  Dont go here.
