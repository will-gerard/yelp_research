I LOVE Rock bottom. My husband and I live down the street and go here frequently. I always get a burger (99% of the time), and my husband alternates with whatever sounds good.  We like it so much we often order for pickup on long days!  They have great, accommodating managers, very kind, attentive staff, and a fun atmosphere!

LOVE them. I am loyal! Besides they are closer to me than Starbucks, and in the morning I can get in and out faster! Yummy bagels! LOVE their lowfat Blueberry Muffin. The iced teas are all awesome, and their coffees are tasty!

I love this restaurant! And they deliver! They are quick, authentic, and tasty. When I need my "real" chinese fix they are my go-to! Their portions are huge... And did I mention they have green tea ice cream?

This store lost a customer. After the manager disrespected my role as customer I no longer will be ordering from this particular store.

Waited ten minutes to be greeted at the window, with an apathetic tone. Waited another ten minutes for my food. With a "here you go". No apology, no smile. They acted like I was inconveniencing them for being there.  Then a couple of days later I order two sides, and both were wrong when I got home.

It's rare that I have notable positive experience at a fast food let alone think of writing a review about it! Not only was my order 100% accurate based on my order at the drive thru intercom, but the attention to detail was fabulous. I got a turkey burger without condiments and added guacamole (amazing btw), and stated I wanted ranch with my fried zucchini (usually that never ends up in my bag). All aspects were correct and cooked to perfection, as well as impressively ripe and red tomatoes in my burger!

It always takes me 20 minutes to get through the drive thru, no matter if there are ten or two cars. They've messed up my order numerous times (including not making it decaf which is actually a problem for me), but I will say 50% of the staff is nice and apologetic so just as long as I get one of them I don't feel so upset about waiting. I'm a loyal Gold card member so I do continue to go but I'm not pleased.

Dr. Ito is awesome!! This wonderful dental practice won't scam you and push you into procedures you don't actually need. The front desk staff is welcoming and personable, often chatting with you while you wait, and it is a really calm, easy going experience in the exam rooms!

I love this quaint little library. The children and baby story times are fun and well done! The children's section has an amazing assortment of books and a cute play area that has some innovative activities for little ones to do while their parents gather books nearby. There isn't much to complain about here! I love coming.

After a negative experience at another swim school I went with my gut and came here. I told them about my toddler's bad experience and how it changed her mild water anxiety into full-blown fear. Tim, the instructor, was SO gentle and patient with her, and didn't force her to do anything she wasn't ready for on her first day. He was encouraging and walked her through the steps of Survival Swim, and helped her participate with the other classmates at her pace.

Dr. Villa and Dr. Reyes-Hailey are absolutely wonderful and I wouldn't think of going to anyone else! They were there every step of the way for a complicated pregnancy I had and I'm happy to say that my daughter and I are healthy!  Dr. Villa is thorough and hilarious. Very knowledgeable and does what is best for YOU. Dr. Reyes-Hailey gets the same accolades from me and she will sit and talk with you about anything you need to discuss until you feel better.  Love this office and I love all of the administrative staff and nurses. Amazing amazing. Did I mention they play HGTV 24/7? :)

Made an appointment at the Portrait Studio for 5:30pm. It is now 6pm, and I am still waiting. They "close" at 6 and there is someone after me. The "consultant" is still talking through photo choices with the family who was here before 5:15 when I arrived. I came to take Maternity photos, and I feel like leaving, but this is really the only chance I have to get them done so I am trying to be patient. We will see what happens. *********** So, 50 minutes after my appointment time, I am still waiting. I walked out.

For piercings I highly recommend Justin (goes by OJ there). He put me at ease for my nose piercing, did it quick and efficiently, and it looks fabulous! For tattoos my husband loves Neil. He's done two very special pieces for him and is going to do another here soon. His detail and shading is crazy good.

OJ once again pierced my nose (I had taken it out a couple years ago and let it close up, oops!) And he did a fabulous job. Super informative, quick, nice and calm, and funny too! It hurt, as expected, but so little tugging that I barely noticed after the initial piercing action. Thanks again OJ!

Friendly staff. Small atmosphere. Nothing to write home about :) They brew their own "house" iced tea. I got the Black. It was very good! Ordered the Grilled Cheese w/tomato, mozzarella (pasturized), and basil. It comes with homemade potato salad or a green salad with vinegarette.. I got the green salad. The sandwich was filling, warm, and "comforting"..but bland. No real zing to any of the ingredients. The salad was very tasty with a potent, tart vinegarette.  Sat on the patio next to two very loud, crude, ASU sorority girls, which isn't the bakery's fault ;)  All in all a nice lunch.

I watched my 1 year old nephew have a fabulous experience here. They have a 1st Haircut package that includes a photo! He sat in a bumbo and the experience was positive. There's also a train table in the waiting area.

We had such a wonderful experience! The manager is beyond sweet. And my three year old daughter had never been in such a chaotic environment before and has a fear of heights. Lauren, one of the bounce room aids, took her under her wing and made it an unforgettable experience! We love Lauren and because of her my daughter wants to go back!

Food: huge chicken strips for kids! My 3 year old and 1 year old split the order and couldn't finish. Fries were amazing to me, oily to my husband. Burger had no seasoning and tasted like pure cow. Couldn't finish it. Bun also tasted like a potato bread base which made it squishy and chewy.   Service: fine until we got our food and then she disappeared. No refills. Not enough napkins. No check back on food quality. Once we saw her again we let her know my husband couldn't eat his salad, that our drinks were empty, and asked for garlic bread and the check. It took ten minutes for her to come back with the check and the manager brought the bread out, we told him we had to leave because our daughter needed to sleep, and he boxed it up for us. $37 for the girls to eat, and us to munch on fries.  Environment: awesome.  Probably won't come back unless a group is coming and invites us.

This place has a good mom and pop feel. We almost always go on weekend mornings for breakfast and it's always busy, which is good! The last 4/5 times we have gone, I've been unsatisfied. The servers always seem to have tables spread out over the entire restaurant, making it hard to regularly get service. The coffee is "eh" and I've never had it hot. And the food is fine. This last time, though, we had a fabulous server who understood our young daughter's emotions that morning, and said she had three children of her own, and made our time there stress free, every aspect of our order accurate, and was friendly and attentive. She even went so far as to time our girls' orders to come out first, and made suggestions based on our preferences and children's eating habits. This changed our point of view on the establishment.

Always friendly, always focused on YOU the customer. Efficient! And tasty too. Their hot beverages are great. Tried this seasons Pumpkin Latte last night and was surprised at how much it resembled Starbucks! I am a huge Starbucks fan and usually when I get a Pumpkin Latte anywhere else it's less flavorful and pretty watery. This was the bomb! And cheaper too ;)

This is, by far, my favorite coffee place. I can't remember the last time I went to Starbucks. Once I discovered Dutch Bros I never went anywhere else! The staff rocks. They recognize me every time even though I don't come every day.  If I tweet them and Facebook them they always reply. AMAZING COFFEE! With Coconut Milk as an option for all you vegans/allergy prone peeps like me! They can make any drink with coconut milk or soy milk! That was a win for me. I missed my mochas!

I love this quaint restaurant! I have so much fun eating here because the choices on their menu are unique, yet familiar. I adores my tuna salad sandwich and my daughter loved her classic pb&j. Our server, David, was very friendly and accommodating, and out my daughters order in first so she could eat faster!

First of all, that is the nastiest bathroom I have ever seen in an eating establishment. I'm not saying it isn't clean, because it might be, but the bathroom has deteriorated so badly that I couldn't tell. I was grossed out to put my toddler on the peeling cracked toilet seat. I am sending the photos I took to corporate.

I got the Breastfast Burrito sans eggs and tofu because of allergies.. It was amazing!! Their fruit bowl is versatile and fun. Noisy-ish if you're dining in, mostly because of the juicer (yes they juice your drinks right there..) but think of it like a cafe. Fun and original! Great varieties and options for vegans and people with allergies!

My daughter sat on my lap (she is 7 months) and we had a great time chatting with Andrew and the other hair stylists! My do is fabulous. He did exactly what I asked him per the picture I brought in. I will be back!

I am GRINNING and SIGHING with each sip I'm taking of my Iced Decaf Vanilla Latte with almond milk. This replaces my interest in any other valley coffee shop. And now that I've found this place I am contemplating moving closer than my current city which is 30 min away!!!

I was told I needed a lot of procedures that, in fact, I didn't need when I got a second opinion at a dental office nearby. The staff is personable but that is about all I have to say regarding this. I was in there for 3 hours for just a consult and X-rays.

It's clean. It's affordable! They have a bunch of topping options and an assortment of frozen yogurt flavors. There is seating inside and out, and a little kid area with a small table and chairs, and a movie might be playing. Pretty good if you want to go out with other adults and be able to talk! The frozen yogurt and toppings you pick are weighed, and it's 39 cents per ounce. That's amazing!

The atmosphere is hip and fun. As a native of San Diego, I felt like I was home by the beach! The service was fantastic and the food good. My burger felt a little dry and flavorless but others at my table didn't have that problem so maybe I need to go medium well next time :) Oh, and their fries and ranch dressing are amazing.

I will never go to Starbucks again! Nothing will be able to replicate the amazing mocha I had here. I am already drooling over my next visit and I think I'll make it today! The mocha sauce was not overly syrupy sweet, and the ability to use almond or coconut milk sold me. Also, their coffee is a unique type that does not have the acidity most coffees have and it goes down oh, so, smooth.

Fabulous customer service. Tasty, crispy, beer battered fries. Burgers full of flavor. And kind servers who smile and chat with you. I had an issue with my daughter's food today, but they were on it and made us feel important, taking care of it to the fullest. I've been a regular customer here for a couple years and I will continue to do so.

The pizza is delicious and authentic. If you asked me to name a real pizza place that isn't a massive chain in the AHWATUKEE area, I would say Jimmy & Joe's! Not to mention that they've made a speciality pizza called "Healthy Choice" which is cheese less and full of amazing veggie toppings! Cherry on top? They were right on time. In fact, they beat their quoted time.

Their service was warm, friendly, and efficient! I really liked my spiced chai and also my sausage breakfast sandwich. The sandwich felt indulgent and filling, but not bad for me like some fast food establishments! My toddler got a vanilla almond milk steamer that she thoroughly enjoyed. She thinks it is her coffee and was pleased to be included :)

Horchata : amazing, spot on! Mild salsa: tasted like tomato sauce. Medium/hot salsa: amazing! Not too hot! Chips: perfect, crispy, and tasty. Service: quick and efficient, friendly too! Chicken enchiladas: I devoured them. Quesadilla: my girls were pleased! Veggie enchiladas: thy were good but my husband thought the refried beans on the side were watery and bland.

This has to be my favorite quick Mexican place!! We eat here multiple times a week. If only they had a stamp card ;) We are creatures of habit and always get the Super Nachos, Quesadilla, and Taquitos. I think their Horchata is amazing and I LOVE their guacamole.  They have a location in my home town and this one does not disappoint my aching tastebuds for that home-like memory. 5 stars all the way. Did I mention very kind service?

I was shocked to see there wasn't already a Yelp page for this business! I take my daughter to OT in the area and there are always signs for this cafe. Today I decided to follow the signs because they advertise Starbucks coffee! I found them tucked in the business park area, but my oh my are they good!! Their menu is extensive and their choices are unique and some are just what you're looking for... I.e.. My tuna melt. YUM. My husband got the veggie wrap with a side of potato salad, and I gave my toddler my fruit cup. I ordered the cinnamon dulce latte and it is superb! Definitely head over to this place for breakfast or lunch during the week.

I stumbled across this place while taking my daughters to the I.D.E.A Museum across the street! I walked in and immediately fell in love with the environment. I met Jarrod at the counter and felt important and excited to be there for the first time! He made me an amazing Almond Milk Chai, and I bought three tasty, soft cookies. I also got 20% off for following their social media accounts! Win win! I'll be back regularly. I love supporting small businesses that are awesome!
