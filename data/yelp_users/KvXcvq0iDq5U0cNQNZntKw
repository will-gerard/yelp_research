Got here right at 5, 2nd party in line and told a 30 minute wait (very rudely may I add). Then they sat us at a table that barely sits 8 and we had 11. They had the exact same table behind us with 8 and they were tight and tried telling us it sat 11. When I asked for an extra table I was met with frustration and attitude. Sorry, didn't know I was causing you frustration by driving 45 minutes out of my way, spending our money and bringing family from out of town. If you don't want to work here, quit, don't take it out on us. We just wanted to come enjoy the scenery and eat. But I promise you, this will be the LAST time ever. Too bad, great location and good idea. Maybe new management or someone who cares?

Very hard to spend money there. They have a sense of arrogance and not very willing to go out of there way to earn business. For the record I have spent over $10K at this shop and today, they lost me for good.   On the repair side, you're better off taking your bike to Auto Zone for repairs. Odds are they will know more about repairs and additions then this shop. They screwed up something as simple as pedals on my carbon cranks.   I will be taking my business and all of my friends to a new shop.

I am real, and I have spent money in your shop. A lot. As for looking at my other ratings feel free. I go out of my way to recognize the positive places in person and thank them for their dedication to great service. Feel free to view my purchases there. Stumpy expert, Specialized MTB for my sons, cruisers for my parents, and many parts and services done. Shop used to be stellar make no mistake about it. Otherwise I wouldn't have spent my money there. The reason I haven't called back has more to do with the loss of faith in your shop. Deflecting the feedback based on attacking my credibility speaks more to you than it does me.

Iced mochas are the BEST! Kids love the chocolate milk with whip cream on the straws.... Awesome staff, super friendly and they just get it! Love this place.

Read the reviews and almost walked away... Glad we didn't. My wife and friends brought me here on a Thursday night for my birthday, and I couldn't have been happier. Our server (Jai) I believe was simply AWESOME! I told her about the negative Yelp reviews and she aligned and said they've grown a lot in a short amount of time. She checked on us regularly, our food was fresh and of course delicious. Never had a drink below half and banana pudding was on point. They do need some help at the front desk, better shift managers (they aren't the most friendly people) and a better "peak" strategy however if you can strike at the right time, food is well worth it!
