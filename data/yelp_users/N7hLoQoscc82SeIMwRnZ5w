Considerably better than the surprise location. Not sure if it's the happy hour pricing or the food quality. May also be the lighting as it doesn't feel as drab.

Stay away from the brisket and Burt ends. The brisket is all meat no char and no fat. The Burt ends is all fat. The chicken is good and green chili Mac and cheese is ok. Unless you are craving chicken I find it not worth the 5 minute trip from the office.
