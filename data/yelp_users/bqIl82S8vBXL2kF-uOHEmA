Airport is very quick and friendly. Was able to get dropped off very easily at the curb and then check bags and get through security within 15 minutes. It's a holiday weekend and traffic is fairly busy, no need to get here more than an hour before hand though

WOW talk about customer service! Came here for my engagement, was such an awesome experience and an amazing meal. Danny Sanchez the gm came over and was more the gracious, he went above and beyond into making our very special night truly amazing. Couldn't thank him enough. Our server Matt was also really genuine and nice, will definitely be coming back here more and would recommend The Keg to anyone!

What a delicious place for breakfast, lunch or dinner! The food is fresh and amazing. The menu changes with daily specials and also offers fresh made cookies and pasties. They also serve beer and wine which is always a plus!

Great place to watch football, they have tons of tv's everywhere! They have a great deal for domestic pitchers $6.75! There food and service is really good too. However, it is hard to get good cell phone service in there, so that's a little disappointing.

Great place for happy hour and it's right in between Tempe and Scottsdale so good location. Happy hour is 4-7, $3 pints and $3.50 premium drafts, appetizers are $4.50. Atmosphere is very casual and fun, huge outdoor patio as well.

Dave's dog house is amazing! Great places to go for lunch, not only is the good amazing, but it's on campus and makes you want to be back in college. I'd recommend the Mac n cheese dog with bacon, delicious!  Also, if it's your first check in they give you a boston dog for free!

The wait was ridiculous and there was no one here! We bought the groupon for 2 entrees, 2 salads and 2 drinks, the drinks were completely sugared down. The entrees were actually pretty good and really filling. The pricing is expensive, but normal for vegas.

What an excellent experience this store offers, lots of workers who are always willing to help and asking to assist. Went in today looking for a patio set that was sold out nearly everywhere in the valley, right when you think there was no chance of getting it...one of the employees went out of his way and spent time to track down the patio set and make sure I was able to get it. I'd like to give an extra thank you to Mike Gooch for taking customer service to the next level. I'd highly recommend this store for any home improvement needs.

On Thursdays until 7:30pm there have half off liquor, which is a pretty good deal! The games are always such a fun time, great for groups, date night or just hanging out. The games do get fairly expensive, but a fun place!

Bought the Groupon a few months back for the Rock Gym. It was my girlfriend and my first time ever climbing, the employee explained everything to us in detail and made sure we understood how to climb! They were very friendly and obviously with the Groupon it was a steal of a deal!   There was plenty of wall space and different tracks/paths all over, the facility is huge! It was a lot of fun and something different to do. After about an hour or so my girlfriend and I were exhausted and our arms can already feel it. Would definitely go back and would recommend to anyone to go here.

They have some really good pizza here! We had the white pizza, which has some garlic and white sauce, really tasty. They don't have any garlic bread or French bread, which was a little disappointing. They also don't have happy hour, although some of their house wines are $4 a glass at all times.  Also, if you sign up for their birthday club you get a free large 1 topping ($18 value)!

Went there for happy hour, sushi was decent and service was quick. However, the website was completely different than their actual menu and the happy hour menu is 100% different! Which was very disappointing.   The new happy hour is only 50% off when you order 5 regular rolls or more... Again website says completely different. So beware it's not as great as it looks if you and  only 1 other person are going there together.

Went there for Taco Tuesday last night and talk about a great deal! They have $1 taco, chicken, steak and carnitas. Wow they are good. You do have to have a beverage purchase, but they also have $2 Mexican drafts, so it's a great deal all around!  There was also a live band playing as well. Bartenders are always very friendly and outgoing.

Great wine bar! The atmosphere and ambiance was very friendly and casual. They have a lot of tables, couches, comfortable chairs etc. The bruschetta was excellent as well. The waitress we had was very attentive and made sure to keep checking in on us. Would definitely go back.

Got the new pepperoni pizza with pretzel crust and cheese sauce! It was amazing, not to mention it was only $6, what a deal. The location even had it hot n ready, so I didn't have to wait around. Will be getting again.

Got the new bacon and cheese stuffed crust, yumm it's pretty delicious! If you order online you can get an order of breadsticks or 2 liter of soda for free. Ordered delivery and got the pizza within 30 minutes, so it was really quick!

The facility is really nice and the stadium is fairly reasonable to navigate through. They have value $4 beers for 12oz, it's cash only but a decent value. You can typically buy bleacher seats in the lower level for about $15 unless it's a Saturday game.

Had a DealChicken for the golf course which was an amazing value, came with a round of golf, couple sleeves of Nike balls and lunch for $15, however when we checked in a they had was cheap Strata golf balls that no one wants, requested Nike's like the voucher clearly states and again was told tough. Course was in fair condition, some of the greens had really bad bare patches in them. Also, went to the club house at 4 after we were done and were immediately told we had to leave cause there was a wedding coming in. So much for the 19th hole!

Hilarious places, filled with lots of laughs. Great for date night, big groups, or just a night out on the town. The stars usually come out after the show and you can meet them/take a picture, so that's cool. Have been here several time and would keep going back.

Had a 10 person band play, with all kinds of different instruments last night. The band was truly amazing and played such a wide variety of up best music. Kiss FM was also there and offered $.01 drinks, so our table got a free round!  There was probably 80 beers on tap, had the big blue van beer and it was delicious. Never heard of a lot of the beers, but have so many local beers to try!

Went on a Friday night, they had an excellent country band... The place was packed however, we were able to round up a table and the server, Leah was really good! She continually checked on us and was very quick about getting our drinks! Fun places to hang our with a date or small group of friends.

Had a decent happy hour, $5 drinks and $6 happy hour, which is a couple dollars off. I had the chipotle chicken pasta and it was amazing. All our meals has a large portion to them. They also have complimentary bread and oil, which is fresh and truly delicious.

Had the Lester burger, it came with green chile pulled pork on top of a burger with bacon, cheese and avocado! WOW, the burger was excellent... Have also had their chop salad before too and it was great. Food service was extremely quick too, little pricey, but expected for an airport location.

What a great place to always come for live music! One of the best country bars in Gilbert/Chandler area! Tony Martinez, who opens for Jake Owen and other huge hits plays here, what an awesome guy/band whose down to earth. Go sit at the bar, Sara is extremely friendly and they all provide awesome customer service, would recommend to anyone.

Great place to go before Diamondbacks games, not a lot going on afterwards. Drinks are about the same price as the Diamondbacks game.  Bartenders were very friendly and served everyone quickly.

What a great place for a Saturday night! A lot of fun, country music, a lot of people and great drinks. There is usually a long line after 11, you should expect to wait 30-45 minutes unless you want to pay a few dollars or are a group of girls. The place gets really busy, so get there early and find a good spot to hang out.

I've played men's slow pitch softball over the past several years! The facility and complex is pretty nice. The best part is they have a concession stand, which they serve beer and wine. It's $5 for a large domestic beer or a large glass of wine. The prices are actually really cheap. However, there is usually only 1 person working so the service can be a little slow.  The staff is usually very friend and the fields are in good conditions!

Great place to park when traveling for a few days, covered parking is only $11 vs $25 at the airport and with the light rail connection it only takes about 5 minutes longer!

The best server in the house is Dan/Daniel... However mgt made him serve our 26 top and several other 10+.... It started off really good, once we get our whole group there is was completely down hill... Almost every person has their order messed up and it took almost 45 minutes just to get a draft beer...   We were ready to leave made the mgr on duty aware of the situation and he did close to nothing about the situation, it all seemed like he told everyone to avoid our tables. How could one restaurant mess up a table so bad! At least half our table had our order messed up or not delivered after an hour and their reason was "sorry we don't know what happened"....   After we BEGGED for our tab for 30-45 mins by standing up and requesting several times, they finally hand it over with an auto 18% grat charge... Again. Daniel was great, however there is he had 3 or 4 tables with 10+ people... He could barely handle our 25 plus table and mgt wouldn't allow him otherwise. Like seriously VIg, realize that when a group makes a reservations for 25 people or requires a server by it's self or at least 2-3 servers!  Would NEVER recommend this again based on my experience tonight! Mgt really didn't care about our thoughts or concerns or that it took 2 hours to get food, I hope owners review this concern with mgt and realize there is an issue!

Went to the Wine Warehouse on a Groupon, received a wine tasting and meat and cheese platter. The wine was awesome! For the meat and cheese platter you got 1 piece of pepperoni and 1 piece of salami, so that was a little lame. However, the server was really knowledgable and fun. The store offers a huge variety of wines and has a nice atmosphere, would go back and recommend for a relaxing night!

Came in with a party of 10, waited for 2 hours like they told us, ended up playing bags and jenga which was fun... However they made us order from the bar for a group of 10 food and drinks, so no server.... 2.5 hours later we ended up leaving and I alarm the hostess how long the wait was and she said "we have no wait" some how their wait disappeared and we still never got a table! Worst experience for wait, they need to hire more people asap!!!

Amazing suits and awesome deal!! Recently my best friend got married, being his best man we talked a lot about the suits... It became apparent almost immediately that buying them from Parker and Schmidt would hands down be the best idea.  We met with Michael and he showed us several different options to choose from and was very attentive listening to what our needs were. He provided and showed us numerous options to make sure we got exactly what we wanted.   Michael is extremely professional and a down to earth nice guy. This is a genuine guy who truly cares about your needs, your suit and all your event needs! We had found him to be very responsive and reliable throughout the process.  Not only was the customer service impeccable, but the prices were to die for! I've been in 3 other weddings recently and paid so much just to rent them from one of the major suit chains...this time we ended up BUYING suits from Parker and Schmidt for less than any of the other suit rentals! After meeting Michael and getting his suits, I don't know why anyone would EVER rent one or buy one elsewhere!  I've now had several other friends also use Michael for their weddings and we've all had nothing but great experience! I just got engaged and will HANDS DOWN be using Parker and Schmidt.   Would absolutely recommend them to anyone!

I have stayed at the Imperial Palace before and have always enjoyed my time there, great location because it's center of the strip.  However, I was there recently and had the worst hotel experience, there is no cell service in the hotels, the hallways, rooms and furniture all smells like smoke. Our keys cards continuously stopped working and they only had 2 elevators working! At on e point we waited 30 minutes just for an elevator.

Bought the Groupon for 3 guys 2 hours and was a pretty good deal. Ended up having a lot more stuff than expected and took us about 4 hours. Jahan, Allen and Victor was very quick and definitely hustled throughout the moving process, they took great care of all our belongings and were very thorough.  Everything was yes sir, yes mam and were very professional. Would recommend to others.

Great place and great atmosphere... They have happy hour from 2-7 and then every night is ladies night, specials for them is 7pm-10pm so that's pretty good.  They have rotating beers and always have some sort of special. Very very responsibly priced.  Lots of tv's and they have football specials beginning in Sept... Also a great outside patio for when it cools off.
