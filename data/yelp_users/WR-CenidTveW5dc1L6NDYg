It's a great place to get your teeth worked on.  However, give it about a few months and then you receive a bill in the mail for some balance, even though you paid in full when you were there.  Now, the explanation was that due to the insurance not covering some minimal amount, making it worth it to ruin a good reputation by sending me a bill 5-6 months after.  The lady on the phone said that I just paid the estimate, and not the actual amount.  So why would this place misquote their customers?  I've been to a few dentists, and never has this happened to me, where I paid in full after the procedure was done, and then get another bill 5-6 months later.  Unbelievable.  Even though the dentist does great work on teeth for what you came in for, be careful of additional recommendations for extra($$$) work as it is not necessary to get right away(ex. root canal, crown, etc.),that's if your teeth don't hurt.  Am I going to be looking for a new dentist?  Mostly like yes, until this place gets their billing straightened out.  Remember, I wasn't looking for a freebie, as I paid over $500 to that place, the 5-6 months later bill was minimal, but it's the principal that counts.

Checked out this place online a while back.  It had everything I wanted, which was a garage and a one bedroom, not too much to ask for and probably the easiest sale for the leasing consultant.  The communication in the beginning phases was kind of difficult before the move in, but I'm sure it's because they were busy.  I can see where one reviewer was mad about the time table on her exit experience, as I had made arrangements for the movers to come in the morning.  I asked the staff if they can give me the key the day before or at 8 am, they don't open until 9 am, but I was advised someone always comes in early at 8:30, so I told the movers to get some breakfast.  Anyways, no one showed up early, but it worked out in the end.  However, I can't see the same reviewer get mad for getting billed on the carpet damage, as she stated she had pets.  No new person wants to walk in anyone's pee or poop, including puppies.  Overall, love this place, the neighbors are awesome, the staff is excellent and somehow with all the residents, they do know you by name, maybe that's a good thing or a bad.  Never had any issues, so hopefully this doesn't jinx it.  Maybe the only issue I have is the mosquitos in the warmer months, they'll eat you alive, but that's probably because of the canal that's close to the complex.  No place is perfect, but this 99.9% satisfaction, even Lysol isn't 100%.

Used to go to this place on Friday nights after work for some drinks and food around 7:30 to be exact (after traffic/rush hour).  Everything was awesome until they stopped making prime rib.  About a month ago, went there and ordered prime rib, but the excuse was that a someone had a party and everyone ordered prime rib within the party.  It's understandable in a way, but at the same time, if hosting a party, you'd think a place would prepare a little better for the party guests and for the other patrons coming in as well.  Tried it again a couple weeks later, same thing, all out of prime rib, except no party.  The week after, again, out of prime rib and the waitress/waiter said that I should of came in sooner than 7:30.  Well, I would if I or my friends didn't have any other responsibilities and if we all lived close by.  So, to my conclusion, they must not make prime rib anymore, because they're always out.  Great steak, but anyone can grill and prime rib takes hours to make, hence I always order it.  The Keg on Tatum and 101 still has prime rib at 10 PM, maybe even Firebirds next door.  Other solution is Logans on I-17 and Happy Valley.

The prices are more than reasonable.  The food is amazing.  I wish they had a bigger menu with more options, maybe some day they will expand.  The location is not in the best part of town, but never had any issues.

The best rice and beans food ever.  The meat is there, you can see the 1 oz put on there, and you can almost taste it, but almost doesn't count.  The guacamole is priced at like 2-4 avocados, 400% or so markup, not bad.  Don't come here, because its good as junk food.  Carbs, and more carbs with a little fiber and maybe protein.

This place has got some of the best Mexican cuisine in town.  One of my favorites.  Cream cheese jalapeno dip is a must, that's probably the number one reason I go to this place when craving Mexican food.  Mini bandidos are great finger foods too.  The place is always busy, but when it's good food and reasonable prices, can't expect any less.

It's just another Sushi place.  Clean, descent food.  I can't give it 5 stars because I didn't notice any specialty item that is a must have to come back anytime soon.  The prices are very reasonable and probably the best place for that area of town.

Been here a few times, but today marks the day I review it.  The reason is because I took a girl out to lunch here, she had their slice of pizza, and there was a long hair under/in the cheese half way through eating it.  Gross!.  She lost her appetite, I felt like crap for telling her it was a good place.  The food is good as long as they hold the hair.  Didn't ask for a refund, but did get another slice for her, so she can attempt to overlook the previous one.

Spoke with Dan the owner.  Told him what my issue was, meaning that my A/C isn't working.  He advised me that he will send a technician out, time frame 7-10 PM.  His technician Chris came out at 6:37 PM, ahead of scheduled time, which is a big plus in 100 degree weather, and got the unit fixed in a matter of minutes.  Great company, fast service, and very reliable.  If you need an HONEST service, this is the place to choose.  Keep up the good work.

I've ordered some takeout and they were very good about getting it correct and accommodating my modifications.  The area is not the greatest.  Most of the people don't speak English, which doesn't matter, because everyone understands the menu and money.  Simple.  The bread is what makes this place a very good choice of cuisine as it's made there in front and you're able to see how they prepare foods.  Big portions and the hummus + cucumber spread are a must.

Been here three times, giving them three chances to improve.  Every time I've been here, the service has been awful.  First time, it took 30 minutes for food to get to my table, and about 10 minutes for a refill on my lemonade, there were about 20 people at most in the whole place.  Second time I came in for just a drink on a WEDNESDAY night with a friend of mine, went to the patio, notified the hostess that I will be outside and she said that's fine you don't have to tell me.  Waited outside for about 15 minutes with a few waitresses that walked by, seen I have an empty table, and finally one asked if I've been helped.  I said no, and she said ok, I'll get someone for you.  About 5 minutes later, a waitress opens the door and asks what we want, while holding the door open as in hurry up and tell me so I can go back inside and do nothing.  Ordered a couple drinks, waited another 15 minutes  and a different waitress brings them, stating she's going to take care of us.  About 20 minutes later, she asks if need anything, check please.  Third time, came in, waited 10 minutes at the table, finally got approached, ordered a water and a coke.  Another 10 minutes, she comes back to ask me what I ordered again, then it came in after another 10 minutes.  So in about the next 15, got approached, ordered food. Fries and a focaccia.  Took an HOUR and 15 minutes for food to get here. 50 cents for ranch.

I just stopped for lunch and just got some appetizers.  The service was good, but no recommendations for their specialties from the staff. The drinks, just had some water and soda, come in a plastic cup, which gets nasty after a while, as food gets stuck in the corners.  Chips and salsa were good, but there are two types of chips, crispy and soft(chips are meant to be crispy not soft).  The food was ok, but it was the guacamole that caused this 2 star review.  When it's a Mexican cuisine, you would think all their Mexican dishes would be meeting expectations.  The guacamole looked like it was sitting out for a while or it was made of old avocados as it had a couple dark spots, but I thought I'd try it.  That's when I made a mistake as I should of followed my instinct.  The taste was just like the the look, tasted somewhat spoiled or again, the taste of guacamole sitting out for a long time/old avocado.  The lettuce garnish was garbage, looked old and cheap.  I don't care for the garnish, but even a big mac has better lettuce.  The price was very reasonable, but still won't going to come back to this place any time soon.

There is a couple Mexican food places in this area, however, this place is by far the best place out of all of them.  The taste and the portion defiantly gives you your money's worth.  The salsa bar is great, I wish they gave you some additional chips to go with the salsa.  The place is very reasonably priced, very clean, the ambiance is very neat for the size of the restaurant,  and the owner is a very nice gentleman.

I use to love coming to this place to get my car washed, until some little tool today didn't want to spray my windshield off at the auto wash.  The auto wash doesn't get the bugs off, so every time in the past 3 years I've come here, they've done it.  He tried to up sell me to a $9 wash and then he said he'll do it.  I refused, and will take my business elsewhere.  Everyone else has been good in the past, but it takes one to ruin it.

I had high expectations for this place considering it's a well known local place, but oh my god!  What a disappointment.  The TV set up is awful, who uses projectors anymore?  The food was ok, but the service was non existent.  Ordered a drink, then food when the waitress brought out the drink.  I ordered a burger, because it's hard to screw up...it was slightly burned on the edges.  No napkins or silverware.  No condiments.  Not checking back until 15-20 minutes later to see if anything is missing like napkins or condiments.  Horrible service, maybe the bar is better.  This place gets two stars because the bus boy was more around and brought me a refill when requested, and the wifi works.  Just another desert ridge business that will go out of business sooner or later if things don't improve.
