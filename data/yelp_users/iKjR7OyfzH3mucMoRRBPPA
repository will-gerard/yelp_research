They have recently re-printed the menu, as the pricing is a little higher.  But the quality of the food is great, their service is fast, even in "rush hour" they still get the food out of the kitchen and on to the table.  I like the 'Sonoran' with it's cheese sauce and the 'Papas con Chile'...   This is Mexican food at it's finest for a chain restaurant.  On the Border needs to learn a few tricks from these guys.

I agree with Jason B, the service here SUCKS!!  You have to flag down the wait staff and tell them what you need, they are NOT helpful.  The food was good, when I got it.  I came here with a group of 14.  Most of our party already had dessert, while I still even hadn't gotten my salad.  I was the last one sitting at the table when everyone got up, still eating my food.  This was not a pleasant experience.  The waiter was EXTREMELY forgetful and had to be told several times that I didn't have my food.  I feel that my meal should have been comped, because the way things were handled, I AM NEVER GOING BACK!!

I love this place!!  Very good food at reasonable prices.  Be prepared for a wait with large groups and at peak times, but the food is worth it.

I'm sorry to say, but Bike Den, at least in this location has closed down.

We had reservations for two tables on Open Table, they seated us next to each other and then the owner came out and merged the two tables.  This was a big mistake!!  We spanned two serving stations and the waiter that was waiting on the other end of the table inherited us.  He ignored the three of us that were sitting at the end, not taking our drink order for 10 minutes, and he passed by my empty plate at least 6 times before it was picked up, where the other end of the table when they were finished eating he promptly removed their plates.    The food was excellent, it's too bad that a waiter with a poor attitude was where we were seated.  The atmosphere is great.  The owner left before we were done eating or I would have complained to him at that point.

Lovely place in the middle of nowhere.  Bottom floor is the bar and the second floor is a game area.  Appetizers were good and cold beer.

Not the best review, since I'm just coming off of a most terrible experience in Albuquerque/Cottonwood Mall.  Came in and sat in the bar on the dividing line booth.  Waitress and Captain came up and welcomed me, I ordered a beer and was going to catch up on news from the day on the phone.  Next time that I am contacted, it was for "Happy Hour is ending, can I get you anything before it does" and I still hadn't received my first beer.  News flash restaurants:  If you see a single party, you need to make sure that this party is visited more than 20 minutes apart.  I have no one to talk to, I usually eat out alone/and or I'm traveling.  Beer was brought, then I was asked if I wanted another before the "Happy Hour" pricing is over.  Suddenly, the other beer appears and I have to chug this one so the other beer doesn't get warm.  (shock to those who know me, but I was already pissed at this point).   Then I ordered food, since it's "Boneless Thursday".  Food order takes about 30 minutes, although it was fresh and the quality is good.. but really?  30 minutes for boneless wings, some carrots and celery and blue cheese dressing?  All is good until I go to close out the tab.  One beer out of three is comped, but the climax to the visit?  The pen that I received from the waitress doesn't write or is out of ink.  I then have to flag someone else down to get a pen that writes.  I'm thinking that BWW is not wanting my business, and since I contacted corporate and didn't get any satisfaction in Albuquerque, this would be the same thing.  I'm tired of people not wanting to wait/serve me, be it a bartender or a wait person.  I did have a good visit in Surprise a week ago, but I don't want to drive to Surprise every time that I want to visit BWW.  Buffalo Wild Wings used to be the place to go when you wanted to go to a sports bar with good food.  But alas, just as in the other comments on this location, it would behoove me to go to the Hooters across the parking lot because the service is 5 times better than here.

First and foremost, this is a SPORTS BAR.  This is not cuisine at it's finest, it's bar food.  And hot bar food at that!!  Had the potato skins and the green chili burger, the skins were hot and fresh, and the burger had real green chilis under the monterey jack cheese.  Beer is cold and tastes fresh, I'm rating this high on the sports bar scale.  Monday Night Football was playing on the big screen, and there were flat panels on every corner.  There is a small stage set up for a band, I presume on Friday-Sunday nights.  It looked like we were sitting in the middle of the dance floor, because we were.  This is redneck at it's finest!!  I'll be back again!!

I travel for business...  a lot!!  I've been to Longhorn before back on the east coast, never had a problem.  I stopped by this location since they were new in the area, and because I had finished up a job nearby.  I went in at 5 PM on a Saturday afternoon, not realizing that it was Valentine's Weekend.  There were about 40 people in the lobby/waiting/foyer area.  I spoke to the host, he assured me it would be about 25 minutes until they could seat me.  I waited... and waited, the pager that they had given me did not go off.  I had an appointment at 6:30, so at 5:45 I went to the host stand to check on how long it would be and to turn the pager in.  They said they had called me, and I waved the pager and said that it had never gone off nor had I heard them call my name.  There was no apology, nor anything offered.  This is very bad business, even poorer service, and it's just the type of thing that killed Lonestar when they were in business here in the valley.  I've contacted the corporate office, but no word back yet, I'll keep you posted on what they did or did not do.
