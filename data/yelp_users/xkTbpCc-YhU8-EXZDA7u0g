Man, if I wasn't scared to death to park in That's a Wrap's death trap of a parking lot, I'd be there all the time. The wraps are awesomely huge and a tremendous value, and they really put together some killer flavor combinations.  Last time I was in I grabbed the In Like Fin, which packs ahi, mango salsa, a peppery ginger slaw and garlicky rice into a tomato basil tortilla. I couldn't finish the thing.   And, as a bonus, the people behind TAW are opening a new concept soon. Keep your peepers peeled!

Maaaan, this place is tiny. Once you get past the fact that there's nine seats, and the griddle takes up about 30% of the building, you realize that this is one of those special little haunts that makes cities cool. It's totally off the beaten path, but just three blocks from First Friday mayhem. You could drive right by and never even notice it (I had about 15 times).   Inside it's surprisingly sparce, considering it's about 75 square feet. There's no AC, just a few well-placed fans on full blast. I went in the middle of the afternoon in July and felt pretty comfortable, especially considering the kitchen IS the place.   And the food... you want greasy, delicious, messy, rich, heavenly sinful pig-out fare? What's that? You want it at dirt cheap prices and with friendly service? It's perfect. The cheeseburger is oozing cheddar, the fries are sliced about four seconds before they go into the fryer and they have french toast in a cup. Need I say more?

The furniture was nice, but I didn't get a welcoming vibe in here at all. First of all, it smells like a dead cat in there -- perhaps it's the mid-century furniture, but whatever, light some incense or something. Second, the guy working there was completely cold. No hello, no how are you, no welcome. He just stared us down the entire time, not saying a word, making sure we didn't touch anything at all. It's a frickin' furniture store! How can you not be allowed to sit on the couches? I don't care if they're vintage or antiques or the like, it's not getting my business.

All I know is that this place smells like old tuna. The cheap kind. There's a bunch of old bald dudes giving me the eyeball at the bar, and the waitresses are less than stellar, even for a dive establishment. I don't care if it's inconsistent, but just be nice. I also question the projector screen that is twice as big as the actual picture.   As for the drinks, there's a fine line between strong and just disproportionate. If you're mixing drinks, just follow basic principles. That's all I ask.

What a pleasant surprise. I can't say I was expecting much based on the outside appearance. In fact, if you're coming up 7th Avenue from the south, you'd think this place is called Aztec. The "A" at the end of the name has been missing for a real long time.  The inside is pleasant and tidy (but not too tidy), with an array of pastries that would rival any supermarket bakery section.   The combos are a superb deal -- most under $7 -- and you get a lot of food quickly. The refried beans and rice are nothing to sneeze at (a subtle necessity to any Mexican cuisine in my book), and the slow-cooked machaca is deliciously tender and flavor-packed.  I really like the covered patio out front. There are some nice skyline views from the west, but it feels less stuffy than the indoor seating.

If you like the Tempe brewpub, this NoSco "grill and tap" is very similar. To start, all the yummy Four Peaks brews are the same (can't you just picture the Four Peaks mobile trekking keg after keg up the 101?), and the excellent pub grub on the menu is identical to the Tempe location. Being an ASU alum, I frequented the Tempe location, and it was one of the most unique and fun bars near campus. The atmosphere in Scottsdale is similar, despite being in one of the north side's more complicated and ginormous strip centers. They've clearly taken a design tip from the Tempe spot, with brick walls, similar lighting and bar and a decent-sized patio out front (not nearly the size of Tempe's, but oh well). I like that there's a loft-like second story to the Scottsdale location, but it's not nearly as bustling upstairs for some reason. If you're in Scottsdale, stop in, order a Kiltlifter and get the reuben sandwich or one of the big juicy burgers.

These guys know their bikes. When I walked in, all I knew was that I was bikeless and wanted to fix that. They did, of course, but they also taught me the ways of the pedal.   You see, the folks at Landis have been biking a long time. They could name which kind of tire you have in a blind taste test. They told me which bike I'd be getting as soon as I walked through the door. They were right. They always are.   I wanted a Trek Eco that wasn't quite done being built. The employee (he shall remain nameless, but he has long hair and looks as if he's surfed more than once) not only offered to hold it for me, but he told me to go eat a burrito while he finished it. He also told me where to eat said burrito.  When I returned, the bike was not only ready, but he had also adjusted the seat to fit me. He never got closer than 20 feet to me previously. But he knew how tall I was. They know everything.  To top it off, they gave me the bike under the MSRP, because they rule. Landis sells high-end brands, but they give them to you at a fair price. I've been back for tune-ups and maintenance since, and I recommend them every time someone says they're looking for a bike. Go now!

It's still my favorite record store in the Valley. They may not have the selection of Zia or the big chains, but this little storefront has wayyyy more character. Owners Steve and Kristian genuinely care about their customers and know most by name. I was saddened when their little corner in the ASU union burnt to a crisp, but so glad to see they reopened in this hip stripmall in the middle of Tempe suburbia. Who woulda thunk it?   They offer hard-to-find and indie-store-only releases you can't find at Best Buy. The prices are fair. They aren't intimidated by Lucky Man's fees and sell tickets at the right prices. And their little cove of a stage puts on some cool shows. It shows that this is a genuinely cool place just because they immediately became part of the neighborhood the day they moved in. I love the collaborations with Mac's and Changing Hands next door. All the more reason to stop by often even though I'm not in the neighborhood.

I've been here about 100 times and seen some really good bands. The Nazi-like control that the owner, Lucky Man Productions, has on this place always ruins it for me. Pretending to be a "local indie" promoter with exclusive rights to this weird dome of a music hall, they charge you and arm and a leg for everything. Ticket fees, handling fees, expensive drinks, even more expensive hot dogs and to top it off, they charge you to park there, in the dingy, hobo-centric underbelly of the 202 freeway. It's never a pleasant experience. For all it's worth, the sound in this place is just OK, but the sight lines are good for a place that holds 1,000 people.

I must admit I feel so uncool every time I come in here, mostly because it's hipster supreme and everyone seems to know everyone. But I sit in here and work because the atmosphere is both simple and eclectic -- I love the openness behind the counter and the openness of the seating area. Plus, good tunes always seem to abound here. Did I mention the coffee is delicious? Smooth, caramelly espresso; not at all the like the bitter over roasted crud at a certain worldwide coffee tyrant. I also highly dig that they worked the tax into all of their prices, so when I buy an Americano for $2.50, it's really $2.50. One more thing: enjoy the pastries here. They are as good as any coffeehouse I've visited.

Ad this place to the bizarre Phoenix list. Don't get me wrong, the food is scorching and stellar, but everything else about this complex of tiny shacks in South Phoenix is a mindscrew. If you don't get there right when they open at 5, prepare to wait. And it might be a loooong wait. When you finally do get called in, there's about 12 different dining rooms you could be sitting in. Sure, they're all eclectic, but some are downright strange. The main dining room, with all kinds of crap hanging from the ceilings, is excellently atmospheric, in a kitschy sort of way.   As far as the grub, the New Mexican chilies they use are killer. They'll attack your taste buds throughout the meal, but they provide rich, complex flavors that can't be beat. The salsas, both the red (burn-your-ass hot) and the green (semi-burn-your-ass hot) are both as flavorful as any I've had. I get everything covered in the green, and I order a lot of margaritas. They come just as strong as the salsas.

This is obviously the mecca of the Phoenician mountain hikes, and deservedly so. Camelback is the perfect mix of central location, unparalleled views and, most importantly, a grueling workout. I love hiking this mountain because of the mix of rock types. It starts out as red rock near the base up to the hella scary rails, then very suddenly changes to a granite look-alike (Anyone know if that's actually granite about halfway up? It sure looks like it.) The last leg is bascially boulders that you have to crawl over, but the view at the top is an unbeatable 360-degree view of the Valley. Though South Mountain has a more centralized view, on Camelback you really feel on top of the whole Valley.  My only complaints: First, the parking is a nightmare, especially on the weekends. Perhaps it's just due to its reputation (and the surplus of multimillion-dollar homes in the area), but it can be hard to find a spot. Plus, people like to jockey for position on those rails, especially coming down, so be careful you don't take a tumble.

This is the best pizza spot in Phoenix, hands down. You've gotta love the Italian craftsmanship that goes into each pie. Sausage, prosciutto and salmon are the house favorites and each pie comes with a generous drizzle of olive oil. The crust is chewy and fresh outta the oven, with delicious bubbles of char.   The atmosphere is reason enough to come here. This place packs the crowds in every night for dinner in its charming turn-of-the-century downtown home. The owners are sweethearts, the wine flows consistently and it's a vibrant downtown must-do. Skip it on First Fridays, though... the crowds can get too intense.

If you like blaring house music, kisras and strong mixed drinks, FEZ may be your new special place. I'm a big fan of the the latter two, so I put up with the house music. Perhaps I don't totally fit into the FEZ clientele, as I typically go for the more chill-out spots, but the quality here is hard to ignore.   The restaurant is really a beautiful space. They did a great job with the interior and the covered patio is excellent year round. And that couch/lounge space against the far wall: one of the comfiest spots in Phoenix.  But don't overlook the food. I've seen countless reviews of FEZ, both on Yelp and otherwise, where people say the food is bland. I don't agree. There are big flavors here. They mix antioxidant-packed fruits, strong cheeses, excellent sauces and quality grilled meats. Everything I've tasted has been a flavorful explosion.  I'm not much of a martini kind of guy, but this place has quite the selection. If I didn't own an Adam's apple, I'd probably go for that chocolate one. Like five times in a row. I'll stick with the margaritas, which are surprisingly good despite the fare being far from Mexican. Plus, you can stumble a few steps outside onto the light rail when you're done.

I heard about this place for years before I actually went in yesterday. It was disappointing. It ended up being a dark, humid, little sweatbox (note: bad smells!) of a coffee shop, with very little seating and terrible hours for a CenPho location (open til 3 on a Sunday...are you serious?). I ordered an Americano, which was actually quite tasty, but switched with my girlfriend because the Chai tea latte she ordered was subpar. Instead of a syrup or a powder, Drip just brews a bag of Chai and then adds milk. What you get is nothing like a Chai tea latte, but rather a milky tea that left me with gas for 16 hours. Skip this hangout.

Went here this morning. As usual, the wait was crowded out to the corner of 1st Street. People are willing to wait for good food, I suppose.   Once you get inside Matt's Big Breakfast (it was about an hour wait for us on a Saturday morning), you see why it took so long. There's about 15 seats in the whole place and it's tiny...like a Manhattan hotel room. People are bumping into each other, sliding around and the commotion is high. It's loud, it's gritty and it's the perfect diner setting.  For all the press it's gotten, the food better be damn good. And it is. The eggs are cage raised and organic, the pork is from high-quality Iowa farms and most of the produce is local. The fresh-squeezed OJ is legit. And the coffee is from a premium roaster in Cave Creek, AZ. The hash browns are very much like you would find at a joint in the Midwest: buttery on the inside and crispy brown on the outside.   Do yourself a favor and brave the wait and the commotion... it's worth it.

Ever been to IKEA on a Sunday afternoon? Don't. You'll want to shoot yourself before trying that again. But the mega-mall atmosphere aside (one more thing: the parking lot is a free-for-all. People fly around through these rows acting like they own the place. The Swedish called, speeders: you ain't getting this discount Euro Modern screw-together goodness!) this is a pretty nice spot. Sure, it's like 70 million square feet and the bookcases are named Billy, but come on, you can find some good quality stuff here for great prices. Roche Boibos it ain't. But that's why you come here -- it's affordable, it looks decent and it comes in a nifty box you can put in back of your minivan. And did I mention the breakfast for less than $2? The eggs are kind of rubbery and I'm pretty sure the bacon isn't really bacon, but somehow it tastes damn good. Get there early and skip the dreaded lunch rush for those salty meatballs.

I've been meaning to try Lola for so long, and finally did this weekend. WOW, it's right on pace with other great tapas spots like Tapino. You can't beat the mid-century style inside. The atmosphere on a Friday night gets an A+ for its buzz and eccentricity. It was loud, vibrant and most importantly, fun.   The food was better than I'd expected. I've read so many mixed reviews of this place on Yelp, so I didn't go in expecting the best. I was blown away (though the prices are indeed a bit steep for tapas plates): the harissa chicken was tender, juicy and packed some serious taste with every tiny bite. The marinated flank steak came with an interesting puree of chili oil, cumin, tamarind and some other spices (it was incredibly smoky, and I'm not sure what the source of it was, but it was damn good) and was cooked just right, medium rare and tender as can be. The special of the night, an artichoke dip with slivered almonds, manchego cheese and spices was the highlight of the meal, made even better with grilled flatbreads for dipping pleasure. The sangria was such a pleasant treat that I indulged several times over. Next time I'll just order the pitcher.   This is an excellent pre-First Friday noshing spot. You'll find me there from now on.

My favorite downtown bar, hands down. Why? It's got the perfect atmosphere -- it's loud, but not deafening, it's cozy, it's got great character and it has a kick ass beer selection. Matt Pool can't seem to do any wrong in my eyes. Have you tried the grilled cheese and tomato soup? There's so much Gruyere on that thing it oozes out on all sides. And the creamy tomato soup, that mixture of heavy cream and savory tomato... it's bliss.   Kinda tough to get in here on a First Friday, but the Sunday all-night happy hour is an awesome deal.

The crowd here is totally not my scene, but you have to appreciate great ambiance and incredible food. It's a haul up to this place from where I live, even when I lived in north Scottsdale, but totally worth it. There are few cooler places to be in the Valley than a warm night on the patio here.  The inside is very New Mexican, with a totally rustic full bar that has been packed every time I've come in. I even skip my usual drink of choice to order the Scottsdale Cocktail (yup, friggin' awful name, but the citrusy goodness in this glass is just too hard to resist).   The food? Some of the best carne asada I've ever had. It comes with an avocado tomatillo sauce that is literally blissful. The honey glazed salmon is also a delight, with an interesting mix of sweet, tangy and just a bit of kick. Though it's kind of BS that they don't bring chips and salsa to the table -- shouldn't be surprised in this neighborhood, but still -- order the chips and salsa trio anyway. It's worth the extra cash for this trio of awesome sauces.

I can't believe all you crazies giving this place 1 star. This is the best TexMex in the East Valley. It's got a great anti-Tempe vibe right in the heart of Tempe, and that's really refreshing. Plus, the food is ace. Who cares if the service is lame? They bring me my food and drinks and an endless supply of chips and salsa, so I can't complain. Those it's mostly ASU kids manning the tables, it's not an ASU-heavy crowd. It's eclectic and has a great tiny bar when full.   The patio scene is one of the better spots in Tempe. I love it when it's a bit chilly outside and they have the fire going. You're right on University, but you feel like you're in your own special nook.   Don't skimp on the food. They use organic veggies and farm-raised meat, and it shows. I'm a sucker for the Steak Ranchero, but I've had at least half of the menu at one time or another, and I've never had a disappointing meal. And the margaritas are top notch. Where else can you find a friggin' tamarind margarita? C'mon people. Head in for happy hour and thank me later.

I've only been to this place on First Fridays, so it's always been a friggin' madhouse. You basically stand in line to get in, and then conga through this little shop and creak the wooden floors. But there's some seriously cool stuff in here. Stuff you'd never need... like a felt squirrel to put on your wall (want it!) and lots of funky T-shirts about murderous cupcakes and the like. Some of the best trinkets in the Phx are right here.

As far as atmosphere and drink selection go, it's hard to beat anywhere in Arizona, let alone in downtown Phoenix. I love how this spot books free live music every single night, displays local artists' work on the walls, has an ever-increasing selection of brews and is a great example of historic preservation. They also accept Phx Bux, so you can save some cash on your drinks. Score!  Yeah, it can be packed on the weekends. And sometimes there are annoying DJs. Sure, the "bar" is actually a half-kitchen, and the "tap" is actually an oversized fridge packed to the bones with bottles of suds. But I'll take this place over just about anywhere else, any time. Here's hoping they install the promised taps soon and open that patio space out back.

This place is just down the road from me and I wish I frequented it more often. It's got a distinct DC Ranch vibe, so be forewarned, you should put on your nice shoes before you head out. The food is so vibrant, though. Don't expect the stuffy steaks and salmon fillets you'd find at other spots in the neighborhood.   I've been a couple of times and each time I've been pleased. The atmosphere is lively and loud, but it's got an intimate, classy interior and a rockin' patio that overlooks the McDowells. I've heard people complain that the employees are too stuffy, but I've never had a problem. Their bar rules, the cocktails are pricey but extremely satisfying and the desserts do not disappoint.  I just have to go ahead and recommend about every damn thing on the menu. It's constantly revolving, so I won't get too specific, but think spicy Spanish plates to share. They have excellent homefry-like little nuggets of spuds that are dipped in a spicy red aoili and fried up. I had a piece of grouper that was unbelievable. And the beef spare rib fell off the bone, and had some nice spice and smokiness.   Overall, it's a great weekend spot... even better with a bigger group so you can try lots of plates and share. It's hard to find any tapas spots this far north, and it's certainly one of the better spots in the neighborhood.

I'm not going to lie: I've been looking forward to this place for months. I checked it out over the opening weekend, and less than 24 hours in, they've got a good thing going. They don't have all of the pieces of the menu in tact just yet, but there's enough there to get a great idea of what it's going to be like. The wood-fired oven gives everything a bit of rustic flair, and the cocktails that had debuted on the menu were poured with a heavy hand, so bravo. I tried the half-chicken, which was roasted to perfection: crispy, salted skin and plump, juicy insides.   The atmosphere is chic, beautiful and airy. The bar that opens into a small courtyard is one of Phoenix's most beautiful, and the patio space will soon have more beautiful people than the Vig. I'm curious to see what the upstairs portion will be used for --whether private events or additional seating, it looked like another fantastic use of space. For as long as they took to remodel this place, it looks perfect.   They do need to do something about the front door, though. It's a wide plank of glass so clean that someone planted his face right into it so hard he was stunned... I'm still not sure the poor guy knew what happened.

This place is in a great little modern-centric plaza near Camelback and Central, and the quality of the products for the home are exceptional. Haus has a beautiful bungalow-like look to it, and packs a surprising amount of furniture, home goodies and little trinkets despite its modest size. Too bad I can't afford many of the things in here (can anyone? honestly?). I'm heavily digging the new pieces in there from plusminus studio (www.plusminusstudio.com) that are on display. The reclaimed wood tables are some of the nicest I've ever seen. I recommend it highly.

To be fair, this is not my typical scene. But even if it's not, a good place should draw my interest, no matter its target clientele. Instead, the people working there are a mix of aggressive bouncers and airheaded bartenders. I was disappointed. Not only are their well drinks pretty pricey, but the music just plain uninspires. I spent a while on the rooftop bar and wondered why everyone was enjoying themselves. The DJ played the same boring, unoriginal beat 1,000 times over and over, yet people were eating it up. I think I'm not cool enough to understand. I heard they're under a new general manager, so maybe this place will get better. The space is great, but the atmosphere is such a bummer here that I can't be any kinder.

Hot damn, this place is a great desert oasis. It's out there for people in the city... like, wayyyy out there, but it's worth the drive. It's been hyped up on the Food Network and stuff, but all the talk is earned. The food here is supremely fresh (they pretty much grow everything steps away) and cooked in inventive ways (see: GRILLED pizzas. Yes, I did just say that.) that makes me actually eager to try just about everything on the menu. I like that Joe's has created a little complex of different concepts on their land. The Coffee Shop next door is about the coolest that Gilbert can get and the little farm stand with refrigerated veggies and herbs is oh so convenient.   One more thing: the slaw on the ahi tuna sandwich is heaven. Purely a delight.

I jumped on the Delux bandwagon long ago, and when this place opened up last year in Old Town I was really skeptical. I had read reviews far and wide praising the delicate little sliders, but I was too afraid to try. Would my allegiance slide? After finally caving in, I'm happy to say this place exceeding my expectations. It's not much for decor, but it's clean, the bar is fully stocked to the gills and the patio looked like a fun spot... although it does overlook a dirt lot and the back of a sushi joint (too cold on the night I went). I've got to say, the burgers are heavenly little hockey pucks of meat. I had the wagyu burger and the buffalo (my first time... damn, it was spicy and delicious and not at all tough like others have suggested) and they were both killer. I loved the thick, homemade ketchup that packed a punch and the peach barbecue sauce was an A+. I also had a side of sweet pots (aka sweet potato fries) and they were excellent. Not necessarily better than Delux's sweets, just different. They had a thicker cut and saltier bite to them. It's definitely one of the best burger spots Phoenix has to offer and hands down the best burger I've had in Scottsdale.

I'd never heard of this place, but when last night on Saturday hipster dance party night not knowing what to expect. Here's the scene: a sprawling German restaurant with a dance floor (Why? I have no idea), a pool table and a maze of wood-paneled rooms that reminded me of an Elks Lodge. Inside: about 4,000 sweaty indie rock kids "sloshed" on 25-cent well drinks. The bar was nine deep in an effort to stock up on this "deal," which was really a lame excuse for a non-pour by the bartenders. When I order a gin and tonic and they use the crappiest gin in the place, I expect to at least get half a shot of alcohol. Not so. There was about four drips of gin and a swimming pool of tonic in there. I could have had 12 of them and not felt a thing. Good thing I only spent $1.   To be honest, I'm not sure what the draw is of this place. Perhaps I should go back when it's in restaurant mode and eat some sausage, but the dance rock night is total lameness. Next time someone wants to hear crappy techno in an uncomfortable environment I'll recommend this place.

Finally tried this place (I know, I'm soooo out of the loop) and I was very impressed. It's hard to find a great quaint little breakfast place that is actually accessible at all times (sorry, Matt's). The décor is great. This old Taco Bell has barely been converted at all, save for a few walls knocked down to make a patio -- a very cool wood-encased little shell of a space. The open-air roof keeps it breathable, but you're cool as a cucumber. The inside is diner supreme: bright colors comfy bar stools in a rub-your-elbows-sized room. I think the prices are very decent and you get bigass portions. I had the sirloin and eggs. I was craving something hearty, and I got it. This is like half a cow chopped up into little bites, three eggs however you like them, carmelized onions cooked to perfect tenderness and diced jalapenos for some added kick. It rocked my life. And have you tried the Over Easy iced coffee? Cold-brewed coffee (read: strong) over ice with sweetened condensed milk, cardamom and cinnamon with mint leaves. It's f'ing ecstasy. Try it, you'll love it.

I had a delicious latte here. They say they have the best espresso maker in town, and it's kind of hard to argue. This place is hipster supreme to the max and way better than any other coffeehouse in Tempe (sorry, Gold Bar, I've betrayed you).   My favorite thing about Cartel (besides the strong brew, of course)? They play damn good tunes all the time. There's no better soundtrack in the Valley. They also have art for sale that's actually affordable (and usually quite interesting). And people are nice here... what a concept. I'm glad they're into the green movement using "plastic" cups made of 100% corn. Downside: I wish they had longer hours and more comfy chairs. Those plastic fold-up chairs really suck compared to the comfy couches.

As far as spring training goes, this stadium was very much like the rest of the city of Surprise: new, clean and welcoming. I checked out the game yesterday between the "hometown" Texas Rangers and the Chicago White Sox, and it seemed like half of the town of Surprise was there. The grass area was well kept (some of the greenest grass I've seen in the Valley) and the facilities were in tip-top shape. The only complaint is the usual stadium bummers: high prices, big crowds and lack of efficient parking (although it was free, so that's a serious plus). A really nice place to check out a game.

Despite the fact that the name could certainly be misconstrued as an innuendo (I can't be the only one thinking this), Pink Spot is a lovely little shop with some delicious cones. I love that the flavors differ every day, so it's always a game time decision as far as what you're going to get. Sure, your chocolate, vanilla and strawberry will always be there, but what about pistachio? Or kona coffee? (Delicious, by the way). I highly recommend their brownies, too. Get that brownie sundae. That thing has a big ass brownie surrounded by a flavor explosion of scoops, fudge, nuts, cherries and delicious whip. You can't go wrong. I'll take a star away because there tends to be long waits (boo hoo), but ain't it cool that it's connected to zPizza? A slice and a sundae? I'm in heaven!

Hands down, they have the best, strongest, tastiest teas. And they actually train their employees to know about all the flavors and benefits of each. The stores are all similar in their freakish cleanliness (they're opening in Fashion Square next week), but I suppose it's all about the zen, man.   I've been ordering from Teavana.com for a long time, so when this Biltmore location finally opened, I rejoiced. I strongly recommend you try a blend of Queen of Babylon white tea and Rose Garden herbal. It's like drinking milk post Froot Loops, but packed with antioxidants!

This place is completely metro chic just like the other Johnny Chu joint, Fate, right around the corner. It's a bit cramped inside, but very lively at nighttime, even without the semi-annoying DJ pumping the tunes throughout the two rooms. The food is all-around solid, taking a hint from tapas culture and throwing in bold flavors for measure. I tried the deep-fried tofu with wasabi soy sauce and it was just like it should be -- crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside. The soy wasabi sauce was sweaty hot and salty -- a delicious combo. The mango papaya spring rolls combine cool, crunchy veggies with fresh fruit and a peppery soy sauce. The combination of the crunch and the chewy, soft wrap melds the elements together well. Finally, the lime mint beef carpaccio on "prawn crackers" (fancy term for rice cakes) provides just the right amount of citrusy punch.   The atmosphere is almost a bit too much Scottsdale for Roosevelt Row, but it's hard to deny the coolness factor here. I prefer it over Fate. Especially after a sake bomber.

Let me say this: the bar at Hanny's is one of the best looking bars in Phoenix. This square-shaped sparkly thing gets an A+ on the presentation, and they make some great cocktails. The rest of the place... not so much. I agree with everyone else: Hanny's has a great concept for a place. They left the skeleton of an old department store intact -- complete with a completely unusable second story -- but the results aren't spectacular. The restaurant looks great inside, like it should be a real classy establishment. So why are they serving pizzas here? The pies are decent, yeah, but really? Shouldn't we be getting steak here? Prime rib? A nice grouper fillet perhaps? With such a nice space and a primo location right in the heart of downtown, I'd think Hanny's could step it up in the food department. It's like this place is confused about who it wants to be: a neighborhood fare spot or a classy dining destination.

This is my new favorite spot. There, I said it. Find me there, often.  I like the airiness in here a lot. There's lots of little tables, couches and a cool bar. Great combination of fresh wood paneling on the ceiling and weathered concrete on the floor. I like that everyone here seems to be having a great time. It's comfort food in the neighborhood, and you're invited. Esthetically, it's exactly what I look for in a restaurant: it can be packed but feel like you're the only one there. Perfect. The bar is spacious enough that I'd come even if the food sucked. Luckily, their gin and tonics -- with homemade gin and a cucumber twist -- are absolutely refreshing and just unique enough to warrant some serious excitement.  And the food? Stick-to-your-ribs good. The citrus brined fried chicken is something you have to taste to believe. The kosher salt on the skin (which, by the way, is not gooey and soaked in oil, but crispy like no skin I've had before -- Popeye's, take note!) sticks like a long-lost lover. It's a thing of beauty. And how about the baked garlic and crostini? Simple, yes, but the garlic is tender and not at all overpowering, so you've got a winner there as well.  I'm determined to try many, many more items here. And have many more gin and tonics.

For a Monday night, man, this place was rockin'! There's not much in the way of lively spots near the Borgata, but Blanco injects a little bit of attitude into this quiet shopping center. The patio space is expansive, and it's a real relaxing atmosphere. They bump some strange, spacey house music, which feels a bit out of place, but it's not loud enough to be annoying or ruin the mood. The ceviches are excellent: try the big eye tuna or the crab and shrimp. The housemade gazpacho base is very citrusy and juicy, which really gives the meat some kick.   The chips are thick and crispy, but lack the seasoning needed. The salsa was fresh and peppery. The pureed tomato doesn't overpower for a good blend.  All the Sam Fox restaurants are solid concepts, and this one is no different. It's fun, hip, California attitude in the Valley and it's welcomed. Most higher-end Mexican spots are pretty cavernous and bland with no atmosphere to speak of, but Blanco is top notch.

The owners of Pinatas tried too hard to fit in their surroundings in trendy Grayhawk and focused too much on the décor. Maybe they should have tried the food first. This is bland, greasy Mexican fare that has nothing to offer as far as originality. The chips left a greasy muck on my fingers and I'm pretty sure the salsa was Pace Picante. The waiters and bartenders were so busy mingling with the beautiful people that they didn't notice how terrible the service was. And did I mention this spot is overpriced? I'll go to Taco Bell next time I want a Gordita. Skip this one -- Xtapa Joe's and Jalepeño Inferno further north are much more reliable.

Man, I have to say, I love this place. Especially on my side of town, with such a lack of good java houses, Press is tops. I like it so much I even took the glamour shots (ha!) for my website at Press. My girlfriend and I have been going to Press since they opened their doors in November and it's like our little Central Perk. The staff, from owner Steve all the way down to the baristas, is an excellent group of lovely people that know their java and help give the spot a welcoming feel. The espresso is creamy and caramelly, just like it should be. I love how they've incorporated coffee, food, wine and even beer into their repertoire. The paninis are excellent and the pastries are possibly even better (I've only tried the brownie, but wow, it was good - warm and gooey with a nice crispy crust). Sign up for the Press newsletter on their website (presscfw.com) - they have a lot of fun events that go on all month long that you should know about (think coffee tastings, wine and food pairings, singles nights, bring your pets events, latte throwdowns and even an upcoming comedy show). Good luck finding any coffee spot better than this on the north side.

I want to like this place a lot. Grand desperately needs some strong eateries. Sapna seems like it should be excellent: cheap, healthy food in a unique triangle-shaped setting. So what went wrong?  I've given this place several tries. Every time the service is terrible. They're understaffed (even when we were the only table there... one person working at a restaurant isn't possible), and if there are more than three employees there at once, they always get confused. I'm not sure what the reason is...the place only has like eight tables.   Second, the atmosphere is depressing. Sapna has a really different setting in the tip of the Bragg's Pie building. If anything, the atmosphere should be the automatic winner. Instead, it's a plain white room with plain white plastic tables. Last time I was in there, the one painting hanging on the wall fell off, hitting a patron in the head. Then it took several minutes for the server to get him some ice. He had a nice ole welt.   I like the quesadillas here a lot. The food is fresh... just not always tasty. The ratatouille is strong. I have yet to find a really great salad on the menu.

You know, I'm not much of a wino, but this place isn't bad. I love the modern feel inside, with a killer open-air bar that spans the length of the building. Yeah, parking is a bitch, but good thing there's complimentary free valet. The wine selection is great (it's no Cowboy Ciao, but way more than you'll find at most spots) and the pricing is decent. There isn't anything in the way of entrées, but who cares? The bruschetta selection is better than anywhere else in town, and a serving of those is enough to fill up my belly anytime.

To be completely fair, Local Breeze really isn't open yet. Well, sorta. They're officially open on Monday, but they opened the doors to us kind neighborhood folks last night in test run, and I must say, the results were surprisingly smooth. Yes, they have a liquor license. Yes, the food is just as good as the fare at Pischke's. Yes, it still is the old Cavness House, just less cluttered and slightly more Bahamian. All of these things make this place good. Sure, they have a lot of kinks to work out, but they're on the right track.  First things first: They seem to give a heavy pour on the liquor, but are quite stingy about their wines. Perhaps those that follow me should recommend a heavier hand on the vino. Second, the food is quality stuff. Think Pischke's, but updated. I had the Olive Lavosh with fresh tomatoes, olives and Queen Creek Olive Oil. Their appetizer menu is chock full of the lavoshes, and they don't disappoint. Then I followed it up with the Fire Island, a Pischke's classic, and it is still at the top of its game. Get it with a poached egg on top to mix with the peppery chicken, creamy sauce and veggies. This one packs a good punch spicewise, so be aware.  Also be aware that those this is the old Cavness House, built in 1914, and we're in downtown Phoenix, it kind of seems like Key West when you walk inside. Gone are the days of the cluttered antiques and strange pieces of junk that filled Palatte. The inside is airy, clean and very simplistic. They may have knocked down a wall or two... I can't really tell. Thankfully, they left the bathrooms completely intact -- the stall in the men's room still looks like a rusted out side of a steam engine. Well done.  Things that weren't so good: They service was understandably a bit lacking. But damn, they need to photocopy more than one "unofficial" wine list for the evening. Our waiter had to continually return to claim it, only to bring it back later with someone else's grubby prints all over it. Most of the wait staff hadn't tried half of the menu items, which is sort of ridiculous, but hopefully that will change quickly. I also feel like the outside patio area lost a bit of its flair from the Palatte days. It's all stucco-y and less ancient. Perhaps it fits in with the loose island theme.  I'd definitely recommend everyone checks this place out, but give it a few weeks to work out the kinks. The outside area is still great for brunch and dinners after the sun sets. I'm hoping they really do integrate the live music thing that Palatte kind of hinted at. It'd be nice to use that courtyard effectively.

I too was eagerly awaiting this place's arrival. I'm a sucker for both coffee and Lola Tapas, so naturally I was intrigued. It was well worth the wait, even on the first day of business. Great, smooth espresso and awesome pastries from Sweet Pea's Danielle Librera. I dig the whole vibe going on here; it fits in very well next to Haus and the other little shops in this ever-evolving plaza. The retro modern feel and color scheme make it one of the more lively coffee spots in these parts (that's a good thing) and I love the little diner touch with the bar stools looking out onto Central Ave. Judging from the crowd they had at 6:30 p.m. on their first day of business, I'd say we have a winner.

Finally! An actual Asian fusion concept that works. The influences here span Asia (and the globe): Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese and Europe. Though the menu is rather limited, each dish packs so many flavors and textures that I'm quite pleased to go back and try everything.   Nine05 also has a great selection of Asian beers by the bottle, and one beer from Brazil (why? I'm not quite sure).   Matt Carter and crew did an excellent job preserving the historic elements of this bungalow and combining them with sleek modernity that stands out in this neighborhood.   My two complaints: It's hot as hell in there. I think the kitchen ventilation isn't working properly yet. I've gone twice and it's been a sauna both times. Also, they don't have a full liquor license, and it's sorely missing some great Asian-inspired cocktails.

Fair Trade has an awesome new space at the basement of the old A.E. motor building in the middle of Civic Space Park, and it's going to be a great hangout spot for ASU students, light rail commuters and downtown residents alike. It's much airier and brighter than the flagship spot on Central and Roosevelt, and the grand opening event last night provided some great insight on how nice this spot can be. Tucked amongst the waterfalls and open-air patio seating, there are great views of the park, the Westward Ho and ASU's campus.   Here's hoping they keep that mobile bar for use on the patio out front. It provided some cool liveliness to the spot that the other store sometimes needs.

Yeah, it's a cash-only spot. I've gotten over that. I just don't frequent it as much as other places, because I don't have cash on me all the time. Oh well.  What everyone has Yelped about the ambiance is undoubtedly true: It's a true gem. I wouldn't expect anything less from this beautiful [merz]project building, nor would I from Matt Pool, he of Matt's Big Breakfast and the Roosevelt. It blends the clean lines of modern cool with the rustic reusability of the Bunky Boutique space that shares the same room. Visually stunning!  The coffee is mighty fine, though I wish it was sourced from an in-state roastery. I'm all for sipping from well-crafted beans, but I'm kind of shocked Matt went this route. Still, sourcing from California is probably better from an eco-friendly standpoint than what most places around here do.   The bathroom, I must say, is the best-smelling men's bathroom in downtown Phoenix. Let's make sure it stays that way. Also, it's Arctic cold in there regardless of time of day. That's amazing during the summer. Let's hope it's equally as toasty come wintertime.   One caveat: I'm an Americano drinker by default, and I don't like when places recommend (nay, insist) you get the iced coffee alternative instead. A few other places do this, but I know what I like. Just a fair warning to my other Americano friends out there.  Can't say I've tried the pastries yet, but they always look very promising. I'm excited for lunchtime sandwich/salad service to start, as this is the time I'm usually doing my coffee shop visits during the day.

I'm a big fan of anything the Plus Minus Studio guys do. That includes Royal at the Market. When I heard Royal was opening a second location at the new Urban Grocery (the first has since closed), I was excited to have it just a few blocks away.  The space doesn't disappoint. Although small, it is an excellent example of urban reuse. The wood features are recycled from old flatbed trucks. Some of Plus Minus' beautiful furniture is also on hand, really giving this little cove in the back of the market some character.  Hayes and Co. brew strong yet smooth espresso drinks and Phoenix's best iced coffee. (I said it! Take that, Fair Trade!) The adjacent room is a nice spot to hang out. I'm excited to see what additions they come up with for this room, as I feel it can be a nice co-working spot for some of the downtown coffee faithful.

What's most important about this second outpost of Lola Coffee is that it doesn't stray from its original formula and doesn't neglect the history of the Gold Spot building. High ceilings, lots of natural light, old-time fixtures and concrete floors -- I imagine this is what the old grocery looked like some 80 years ago in this very spot. Nicely done!  What really makes this spot better than the original location is the full roastery room and kitchen. So, while you're enjoying your cup of coffee, you can smell the sweet, smokey goodness of Lola Espresso Roast wafting up the rafters, as well as the heavenly perfection of Sweet Pea baked goods. You can't beat that.

I always enjoyed the food and bar at Lisa G, but the inside felt a bit hollow to me. Now that the bungalow has been converted into the Main Ingredient, consider me a convert.  They didn't seem to do much -- pop in a refined bar, some new furniture and a slick paint job -- but the place is warmer and much more welcoming. I actually want to hang out at the bar and have a beer (or three).  The food is pretty ace (especially for opening night). Mindy's mac 'n cheese was so bitchin' and creamy, I should've just ordered it twice.  I imagine I'll be hanging around this place quite a bit. It's relaxed, the prices are very reasonable, and the new crew seems in touch with their clientele.

So far, so good. I'll admit I have my doubts about CityScape, but damn, Golds is a nice step in the right direction for downtown Phoenix. This place is done up to the nines -- amazing facility all around.  The locker room is souped up with keypads, the sauna is huge and not (yet) seedy and they offer a bevy of personal care items for you included in your membership. Yep, I plan on taking classes, so I can at least look like I know how to use half of these fancy things they offer.  There are so many machines, free weights, studios and stretching apparatuses that my workouts may stretch several hours long. Deep breath. OK, trying to put a calm on my excitement.  The "cardio cinema" movie theater is just a tick below ridiculous, but then again I'll probably end up using it more than half of the things they offer.  The staff has been really personable so far, which is a big boost up from the Y, where it's basically like pulling teeth just to get scanned in. Count me in as a believer!

Let me start by saying the space is fantastic. Steve and Andi Rosenstein have put the time into this place to make it great. The attention to detail doesn't go unnoticed.  I've been coming to this building for a few years now, both for events and to occasionally check out the couple's retail concept, R&R Surplus, which has occupied the heart of the building for a while now. When they trucked in the bar from an old Capone Chicago haunt about a year ago, I knew something special was brewing.   I love the patio space, with ample hangout room, close proximity to the bar area and easy view of your food cooking on the open grill or in the airstream trailer kitchen. The flat-screen TV has become a go-to spot for Suns games, which I'm totally cool with.  Inside, it can be a bit of a sensory overload -- let's see... there's a bar, a coffee bar, a soda fountain, a produce stand, the R&R Surplus area, a flower shop, a milk stand (yes), a gym, bleacher seating and rehabbed old school Schwinns littered about. There's even foliage in there, so it's hard to concentrate on one thing. I respect what they're doing, but I can't imagine many people will be walking up to the coffee area's streetside window. We'll see.  I'm not crazy about the parking situation. I'm not sure if it's out of necessity, but it seems the place at least shares a couple of adjacent lots, and the fences and blockades around the parking areas make it a bitch to get in and out (seriously). I've been here a couple of times now, and when it's packed, you can wait a long time to get your car back, even if it's parked within eyesight.   Yes, the cocktails are a bit pricey. But, I've been impressed with each I've tried so far (Moscow Mule, screwdriver and a punchy spiked lemonade). The $3 beers ain't bad, either.  They seriously need to do something about paying at all the different sections. I don't know if they need a computer system or what, but opening a tab at the bar, then closing it, then paying for food at the kitchen, then paying for food at the grill, then going back to the bar (and that's just food and drink!) is absurd. I offered this suggestion to an employee and pretty much blew it off. Not what I was hoping for.  Yes, there are some kinks, but the potential of the concept is hard to ignore. This could really be a shining jewel of the Warehouse District. And no, it's not really off the beaten path, people. It's three blocks from US Airways Center.

I'm always willing to check out an Aaron May concept. I loved Sol y Sombra up in DC Ranch, even though it was isolated in its island-like existence way up there. The food and atmosphere was primo, so when I heard he was opening up another tapas restaurant, I never had my doubts.   Some holdovers from Sol y remain -- the patatas bravas, the pil pil, the sol y sombra -- but by and large, the variety on the menu (which isn't overwhelming by any means) is fantastic. Of the five plates I had, I sampled surf, turf, veggies, chutney and grilled bread.   The trout, a nice-sized fillet for just $8, sits on a bed of chilled veggies in a summery vinaigrette, and is the best value on the menu. The filet mignon, a perfect medium rare spiral cut, also was a good value at $13 considering the plate size.   I wish the cocktail menu offered more tequila-based drinks -- it's mostly rum -- but the Aqwa was something special (albeit bizarre): cacao and cane infused liqueur, caffeine, ginseng, guarana and lots and lots of juicy lime. The bartender told me most people have been afraid to order it, but I didn't hesitate. This kind of cocktail mastery belongs at May's other Old Town concept, Mabel's on Main.  The atmosphere is decidedly Spanish -- high-energy Salsa music, tiled floors, vaulted ceilings and a cramped but effective bar area. The semi-outdoor patio looked interesting at a glance, and will be a hit on warm nights. I'm glad they left an understated remnant of the old Pitschke's that used to occupy the space -- a tiled accent beam that supports the roof. It adds some color, yes, but the ode to the space's history is a respectful touch.

It's really nice having a clean, expansive pharmacy in downtown Phoenix. Most people take this sort of thing for granted. Let's just hope it stays that way.  This is one of the biggest pharmacies I've ever been in, and the mini grocery aisle and rather giant selection of beverages will be a hit with the lunch crowd and the ASU students.   They purposely didn't stock 40s or single-serve liquor bottles, which should help keep the scuzz down to a minimum. I'm confident this store will remain nice, despite its "urban" environment and insanely close proximity to transit.   The best part? Suburban prices. See, CVS (and Walgreens and other national pharmacies) have two price models: one for "urban" stores and one for "suburban" stores. Urban ones charge big-city prices. Suburban ones don't. Despite being Phoenix's flagship urban location, this CVS chose to go with suburban prices to accommodate transit users, students and those moving quickly through CityScape. I dig that.

I've only been here once for the Phoenix Contemporary Design Fair, but it's such a cool spot. It's got this strange Tim Burton vibe going on and you kind of feel like you're going to get knifed if you're walking anywhere south of here, but it's got some funky charm. Easy to tell that it was a very charming building at one time, and I'm so glad it's still standing. It has a quasi-courtyard out front and on the west side of the building, and it made for an excellent live music spot on that particular night. Hopefully I can attend some more events there.  What the hell do they do here most of the time? Someone fill me in...
