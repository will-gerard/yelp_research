Arriving gives the overall feeling of an amusement park, there in the, not too far, distance is a playground of food items, wrapped in a costumed, stainless steel, 50's style "shell". The Eggs-Benedict was good (better then my recipe), i know i'm on vacation, even for the day, when i'm eating eggs-benedict ! Hash browns were crispy (not always easy in short order) the staff calls them out verbally to kitchen so there can keep up as well as put out a fast, "impeccable spud". Our server's name was Elly-Mae, and I think I believe her name tag, but the uniform requirements make it tenuous. Milkshake-exceptional, service -good to great, Building/Diner- awesome, bathroom-tiny (but a must see)and follow-thru on theme-thorough .

Okay...... they have pie, and that's all I can remember. Wow....... what Pie! I ordering coffee..........and it gets a little fuzzy from there on?? When I came to, before me were two empty pie plates, there may have been more which were removed, I don't know. The taste of coconut cream lingered on my lips and peach with crumb topping was on my breath..........I only know it was really good, but I think I'll need an intervention, I can't make up enough excuses to drive to Phoenix everyday...... someone is bound to notice.

Sometimes sacrifice is " the name of the game".  We sacrificed; our good sense and decided on a late dinner, at this pasta chain next to the hotel. Roman's sacrificed; quality food, that tastes good and is served hot (or at least a little warm) conversely, chilled if you..... say.... order a Caesar salad. Service, at the expense of our servers potential date.. maybe party invite from the Gangsta Party of five at the next table We watched our warm Italian bread grow cold and die a lonely food death in the kitchen window. Our last cocktail was served by the hostess.  If you're in Litchfield Arizona thinking of stopping in for Macaroni at Roman's Grill...... Don't Do It !

Lets say you want to watch the sun set on the beautiful red rocks of Sedona, and you'd like to enjoy a well prepared meal while you're waiting for the sunset. Well, Shugrue's has just what you want and need. The deck is three stories above the road below and encircled by some really great art galleries. The service was a little slow to begin with but once we got our waiters attention everything progressed nicely. A little viognier as the sun hit the visible horizon, a nicely chilled caesar salad with rolled anchovies and sundried tomatoes as the sky transformed into a fire-like orange glow, and as the last light dimmed from view the stars arrived along with a delicious New York, order and cooked rare over a mesquite fire. I would guess that popcorn would be delicious with this view, but why not have what you really want...it's easy at Shugrue's.

Note to self....if you spot a barely visable restaurant, with minimal signage and BMWs parked in front......stop in! Luckily I was with someone who knew where we were going and smart enough to rush me out the door "to get there early". We arrived just before 6pm on a Saturday night, and shortly there after the hostess stopped seating walk-ins, for those with reservations (or were quoting a 1 hour wait). The front of this establishment is deceiving, but behind all the construction and clutter due to remodeling another world awaits. The bar is large and friendly, and next time I'll ask to sit there just for the experience and a view of the open kitchen. Our waiter, Clark, did an incredible job of guiding us to some great selections. The whole staff was impecable, providing excellent "stealth-like" service. Clark replied, when asked, "try the scallops...they'll change your world!". My world has been changed. I don't eat scallops, but now I do..if , they are blackened, grilled over pecan wood fire then served with four sauces; chipotle, red chile, queso and roasted red pepper. The salad was fresh, chilled and tossed with jalapeno ranch dressing, topped with green onion, diced tomato and shredded cheese. It would seem the moment my salad fork came to rest, the entree' arrived. A juicy, tender, rare, 16oz. New York, blackened using chipotle spices, sauced with a Jalapeno Hollandaise along side their original Green Chile Potato (I'm making this for my next dinner party) and sautee'd eggplant. I did try the Blue, Red & White Corn Enchiladas,which were really good, still I felt really satisfied that I had won the "I ordered better than you did" award...for once!    And dessert? one word....Flan.

From a propane range, served in a tent on the sidewalk of the Courthouse Square, I unwrapped from foil and wax paper a "golden ticket" .... actually a "golden" Green Corn Tamale. The last GC Tamale they had or i would have bought a dozen. then my Green Chile Chicken Burrito (Burro to those from AZ.) was practically perfect. I paid Molly's husband, sat in the grass and waited once again for the Mariachi band to appear.... but they never do ....?!?  Real (good) Mexican Food- Yes Service- traditional Matriarchal Business, she cooks, he keeps his mouth shut Atmosphere- It's a tent...... but where you find the tent can be fun.

Althought it was discovered long ago, by many before me, this inner-phoenix city, local (rural feeling) mini-supermarket was an interesting change from the welll rounded SUPERmarkets  of Prescott. From wine to a full chicken (opened, seasoned and ready to grill), every shelf was stock with just what i needed, and didn't know i needed. Try to stock a mini "frig" in a nicer hotel with snack foods.....from the gift shop? I like the no cashier.....automated...check out...thing, and the staff was nice and even had some nice impulse purchase items for Valentines (a ivy covered heart living plant....nice !)

Stayed here twice in one week and really enjoyed the fact that during non-business days (Saturday) or after business hours (post 5pm) this new area of "downtown" slows to a pleasant pace. During these times the offices and streets seem nearly deserted. Still there are people and place to see with great landmark restaurants and friendly taverns within walking distance. Finishing the evening Saturday, on the outdoor patio with a glass of Grand Marnier and some stunning views of half lite (half sized) skyscrappers gave me an odd feeling....Safe in the City.  The Hotel itself, a completely remodeled/refurnished 60's era Holiday Inn, was quaint and cosmopolitan at the same time with a small lounge and steakhouse on property, along with heated palm lined pool with whirlpool, and some stunning views from the10th floor suite. My Dog loved the views as much as I did (yes, they are pet friendly,extra pet friendly!) and Wendy the Asst. General manager took extra time to make this visit enjoyable. I have to admit The (chain hotel) Holiday Inn is three for three.

A fun diversion from the ordinary farmer's market, this "market " slants to the western trading post/curios shoppe side. Not without some interesting items including: moccasins, native american baby dolls, kachinas, sheriff's badges and carved wooden jewelry boxes. The items which interest me (as always) are edible. Great trail mixes, Hatch Chiles, local honey as well as Arizona citrus, pecans, pistachios and produce. A sample bar of preserves, sauces, salsas and dressings sold me on; a bottle of Vidalia Onion Tomato Basil Salad Dressing, a jar of Habanero Salsa and 16oz of (no sugar added) Blueberry Preserves. The sample table of washabi pistachios, red chile peanuts, roasted pumpkin seeds with chili powder sold me on ice cold fresh lemonade with prickly pear syrup.....tricky.  A friendly shop owner smiled as she bagged up my purchases and dropped a "shipped items" menu into the bag....friendly and smart, a great business combination.
