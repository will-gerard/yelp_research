Excellent pho (it's all about that broth) and outstanding macaron ice cream sandwiches.  Clean dining area. Located in a strip mall. Owner stopped by our table and chatted with us. Plans to add new menu items and additional space in the future.  I'll be back!

Good service and very good food. I had the chicken chimi with sour cream and guacamole and it was delicious. It must have  had been made with an entire chicken breast! Very filling! $1 tacos and $2 Coronas on Tuesday. Nice, crispy chips and spicy salsa. See you there Tuesday.

My first time here. Csme here because of yelp comments and I was not disappointed.  It's a no frills place located in a strip mall. It is clean and the service was fine. I got there a little before noon and shortly after noon there were no tables available. Lots of Asian folk eating there. Lots os choices on menu. I had one of the pho's and a couple spring rolls. Pho broth excellent and everything else was delicious, right down to the fresh sliced jalape√±os. I will definitely go back.

I've been here several and I've only had their regular Philly cheese steak. Its located inside Spectrum Mall. They don't use chezwhiz but the sandwiches are pretty good. I have heard that there special fries are good too but I haven't tried them yet. Unfortunately there aren't a lot of tables/seats so you may want to get your food to go or scope out the available seating. I will definitely go back.

I have eaten here on numerous occasions. The steaks are good but the prime rib is terrific! Remember that this a Canadian based restaurant, so if you order a Caesar you may get their version of a bloody mary made with clam juice.;-) Their stuffed mushrooms and twice baked potato are spot on. They have a nice bar, patio seating and a large dining room. Prices are very reasonable for a steak house and the food is good.

I have been a patient of this practice from the time it was established. I was Dr Wilder's patient when she worked at their satellite office in Scottsdale  (90th st?) about 10 years ago. I had been extremely happy with her and the practice and then the changes started. They established a $60 annual admin fee (not covered by insurance but not a big deal) and then I was given the choice of being assigned to another physician or becoming a "concierge" patient by paying a $1,000 annual fee over and above the regular fees. Since I had no significant ongoing issues at the time, I opted to not become a concierge patient. On subsequent visits I would see a different MD sometimes but more often I would be seen by the PA. When I turned 65, I was informed that the office did not accept Medicare assignment. I am currently seeing a non related specialist where I am given an extensive block of blood tests, etc. Some of this information is sent directly from the specialist to Dr Strohman for the purpose of monitoring my blood thickness and prescribing the required meds.  I was recently informed that, unless I came to see Dr Strohman, he would no longer prescribe my necessary blood pressure and other necessary meds. I explained to the assistant who called that he receives the necessary test results MONTHLY therefore I did not understand why I needed to have these same tests done annually at his office. Since I don't drive and must use Uber (or cab), this will probably cost me an additional $150. Consequently his insistence is going to cause me to seek out a new primary care physician. I really hate doing this but I feel I have no choice.

This has to be one of the oldest buildings still in this mall and it really shows its age. Cant they freshen the surroundings once in a while to make my stay a bit more pleasant? Sort of makes on wonder how clean the place is. The food looks and tastes fine but thhe surroundulings are pitiful. My review prior review reiterated the opioions of those befre mr regarding the cleaniless of the facilitites. Perhaps the cobwebs are part of the seasonal decor now. Dont know what the reason earlier.   These comments are made on observastions and opinions as observed here.

Well it stayed open a year longer than I anticipated. It must have been held together with outside money because it certainly wasn't turning a profit. I wouldn't be surprised if it closed owing venders. There was no closing party or advance notice. I hear Nick bartender found a job but know nothing about Derek, Brenda or any of the others. I think some of them had no other skills. If you know their whereabouts plase let us know . Nick is at Prestons on Thompson Peak at Pima.

My favorite bar/lounge. Very classy but comfortable atmosphere. Friendly staff in both dining room and lounge. Especially enjoy Jayne at the bar. Both her and Matt are excellent bartenders.  Favorite menu items are lobster bisque and the lollipop lamb chops. Bisque is not on the menu but always available. The chops are served with a balsamic vinegar glaze/sauce.

Visited Capital again two nights ago. As usual everything was excellent. Sat at the bar with my friend and we both had the lollipop lamb chops and lobster bisque (yes it had chunks of lobster). Bartender Mat did a great job of taking care of us without being intrusive. Capital is a classy yet comfortable place!

I was there with dates three times in past week; just cant stay away. I always eat in ghe bar area and get excellent service. Their lollipop lamb chops and lobster bisque are outstanding. Bartenders Jayme and Matt are very attentive and personable.  None of my fates nor I have ever had a bad experience at Capital.

In my opinion this is the best fresh fish restaurant in the valley. Their steamed sea bass is unbelievably delicious. They have a large wine selection and a decent sushi bar. Their happy hour is reasonable and they have a good appetizer menu. It's a comfortable and nice looking facility and I've always had good service. There is valet parking but i dont think they validate. There is convenient free underground parking. This restaurant is part of the Eddy V's group and has a similar look, feel and energy.

This is a small restaurant that is almost always full of regulars who know what a gem it is. The food is carefully prepared, the service is very good and the prices are reasonable. I suggest you not attempt to go here without a reservation and that you make your reservation a few days in advance.

This is a bright, clean, airy facility. The front desk lady was  friendly and helpful. There did seem to be a lot of initial paperwork to complete but not a big deal. The therapist Jordan and his tech are friendly, professional and knowledgeable. I've only been here for two sessions but I notice an improvement.

This restaurant has been hidden away here for years  It is at th end of the scottsdale airport runway. It's a down to earth new york family run restaurant serving basic italian fare such as macRoni  and gravy ,  lasagna and pizzas . The food is very good there is indoor and patio dining. Beer and wine is served  and there is a good wine selection. Come here for plane jane italian food. There is plenty of  parking available.

Went here because of Yelp reviews.  I was not disappointed.  The spicy catfish was very good. Not impressed with the french fries. I will go back to try some of the other menu items. Restaurant was clean and the folks there friendly.

Attended a jazz concert here last night and i was not disappointed (except in my date). Kahni Cole and friends performed nd it was great. There truly are no bad seats in the music auditorium neither sightwise nor soundwise.  I only wish that the cafe was open later; it closes at 2PM. MIM just released its fall schedule of performances and there some excellent enents coming. Hope to see you there.

Great ambiance and my server Loren was   very attentive. She was even familiar of the characteristics of my favorite wine. Started with the ahi tuna tartare. It had a little spice but just enough. Entree was the special, a grilled sea bass. I chose this over the signature Hong Kong sea bass. I was not disappointed. I supposedly bad a date but she stood me up. Because of that Loren or her boss Richard Shumaker bought me dessert. Oh I did run into an old friend so I didn't dine alone. There was a jazz combo that was very good and then a jazz pianist took over a little later. The menu and wine list here are very similar to their sister restaurant Wildfish. I thinK they are both excellent seafood restaurants here in the AZ desert. I recommend my seafood froods try both of these restaurants.

My first YELP UYE activity. Nice selection of Mediterranean dishes on the menu including curries and kabobs. I had the chicken tikki masala which is a chicken curry dish. You can request mild, medium or spicy. I ordered spicy and it was served at about what I would rate as medium spicy and it was very tasty.  Very generous portions and inexpensive. Not a large selection of drinks. Only three dessert selections but they were all excellent. There were twelve or so people in our party and service was satisfactory. They also had no problem dealing with separate checks. This restaurant is located in a strip mall and there didn't appear to be any parking problems. I will return to try some of the other menu items.

Visiting this was quite the experience. There are butterfies wherever you look; flying around you, landing all around and even on you. And so many colors and sizes! Although it's a little pricey I don't regret this visit. I've been to the butterfly exhibit at Botanical Gardens, but this one is far superior. You are "encouraged" to watch a 3D movie prior to entering the atrium, but I wasn't impressed with the movie. But I was totally wowed by the exhibit. If the price was a bit lower I would have given it 5 stars.

Nice local pub. Good draft beer selection. Friendly and comfortable atmosphere. Met some very friendly regulars at the bar. The "Ivan Burger" is is a very good burger. I think its a great happy hour bar. Variety of weekly specials.

Stopped by with some fellow YELPERS after HH UYE at Angry Crab. Great selection on yummy desserts. Tried a flat white atthe Starbucks located in the store. Key lime tart was great, coffee kept me awake (I should have gotten a cappuccino).

Interesting concept. I haven't had a pasty since my days in MI. Large variety here. Not an intimate setting, ideal for groups. Large full service bar with indoor and outdoor seating. Bartender Coleen (friend of mine) does a nice job. Nice selection of beers at reasonable prices. Pasties are a complete meal in a pie crust, very filling. It was a fun time (monthly YELP International dinner). This would be a good place to go for a lunch and sit outside in the Spring/Fall sun or for an outdoor happy hour.

Had lunch here with a friend. Restaurant is brightly yet simply decorated. A very eclectic menu wanting me to return to try some of the other items. We both had the lunch special which included soup or salad, sandwich and iced tea or soda for $16. Sandwich choices included chicken salad and sand dab.my friend had the chicken salad and I went for the sand dab. Both of us had the gazpacho. The sandwiches were excellent as was the gazpacho. For $32 plus change we had a nice lunch for two, including iced tea, and it was a substantial meal. The server was knowledgeable and efficient. Parking is not a problem due to the strip mall location. The menu is ideal for vegetarians and carnivores alike. I definitely want to return to try the mussels, the calamari and the burger. I will be back.

I have used Uber car service on a number of occasions (two round trips yesterday). They show up timely, their cars are fairly new, their cars are clean, they're less  expensive than a cab and the drivers are friendly. Highly recommend this service. I hope they get their issues worked out with the State.

I have used Loft several times in the Phoenix area in the past two months. Had only one bad experience for which I was given credit when I reported it. Overall experience has been very good. They show up quickly (except my on dc bad experiece) and considerably cheaper than a cab. They have clean cars, water and snacks, encourage you to sit in front passenger seat and have a personality.  I will continue to use them. I have not used their competition (uber).

Met up here for UYE and so happy I did. The food here is delicious. Choices include country boils of shrimp, crab, mussels, clams with additions of sausage and potatoes. There are several choices and levels of spice with the heat ranging from mild to wow. I had shrimp, clams and sausage with the trifecta sauce at spice level 3. Very tasty! I also had some plump, delicious Gulf oysters and tasted the charred oysters that someone at the table ordered. Unfortunately they were out of the crab. All of the boiled items are sold by the pound. The boils are prepared and delivered to your table in individual plastic bags, complete with the sauce. Eating your selection is messy but it sure is tasty. There is a good selection of draft beers and I believe their is also a full bar. The dessert selection is rather skimpy. Some of us headed for the dessert section of the nearby Whole Food store to satisfy our sweet tooth. It's a good thing that I don't live closer to Angry Crab, because I would be there a couple times a week. As Arnold said, "I'll be back". If you enjoy country boils and crustaceans you've got to try this place.
