This has to be the very worst Chipotle I've ever been to. I've run into massive problems on not on one but TWO separate occasions. The first time I was here, the staff (all kids) where goofing off with the other staff members, running back and forth into the kitchen, chasing each other, with the other kids who were in their street clothes because it wasn't their night to work, with a line out the door.   Tonight, I placed my order with the app a full hour ahead of time to avoid the poor management and customer service only to realize that when I came to pick up my food, they "couldn't find it". On top of that, when I went to fill my drink (iced tea) BOTH iced tea containers were translucent at best which means it was just ice water from them sitting there all day. I'm writing this review now as I sit and wait (25 mins in now) waiting for them to brew iced tea. Normally I would have left by now, but I'm planting a seat to prove a point.  To top it off, the manager is yelling at the cashier who was nice enough to apologize about my order and who was also nice enough to ask for the iced tea. It's not her fault the food wasn't prepped and the iced teas weren't replenished. This place need a wake up call. At least the manager does. Awful. I won't coming back to this one again. I'll use the extra gas to go out of my way to go to a chipotle that is more consistent. Ridiculous.

Nice local alternative to Fired Pie, but more focused and organized! Big fan! (PLUS, Devil's Ale on tap!!!)
