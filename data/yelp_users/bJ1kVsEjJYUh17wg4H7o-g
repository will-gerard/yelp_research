We have 4 dogs and a cat and it takes a lot to make my wife happy especially when it comes to her babies.  Dr. Kastner and Dr. W. are both great veterinarians and good people. The staff is awesome and we refer our family and friends all the time. They know us and our babies by name and provide old fashioned customer service. We have been to other vets and they are OK but this place is awesome! Great service, great information, good pricing, and they know and love our family. They listen to our concerns and only provide us what we need rather than selling us services and products just to make a buck. They will always have our business.

Food was excellent, service was great, first time here and I will definitely be back! Sat at the bar and the gal that took care of us did an excellent job! She left before we were done and the new girl was pretty good too but the first girl was awesome!

Would not honor warranty. They fixed my iPad and the screen slowly cracked because the screen was not set right. Brought it to another place and they fixed it right up. Said they get a lot of second customers from these guys. $60 cheaper too! Waste of money. Very disappointed to say the least.

I typically don't waste my time with bad reviews but the service we received from Service King AND Geico was horrible. The insurance companies are their customers, not you! We received our vehicle back dirty and WORSE than before the accident. They told us there was nothing they could do even though we were able to prove the damage was not there prior. Save yourself the hassle and headache and go somewhere else.

Had a problem with our vehicle at another location. We were routed to the Regional Manager and this location. Noel took great care of us and really turned our previous opinion of Service King around. Thanks!
