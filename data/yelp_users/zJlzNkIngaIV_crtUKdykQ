My husband and I went to the Ahwatukee establishment using the Living Social voucher. This was our very first visit and it may be our last. Let's just say for the actual price of the food that this restaurant isn't worthy of a revisit.   Our waitress was nice but she wasn't attentive and she was quite sloppy. For instance, when taking our menu's away, instead of walking away with them she just places it on the wall divider between us and the adjacent booth. The menus were just lying around there the entire time, never picked up just flopping over into the other booth!!! Our waitress NEVER rounded, we kept on looking for her and another waitress from the table across from us ended up refilling our waters because she was taking forever when rounding. We noticed the waitress across from us was very good to their party, constantly rounding and making sure everybody had their refills and checking in on the food and if they wanted more entrees. Although our entrees were bottomless, we only received two platters because again our waitress took FOREVER to return to our table. By the time we received the second plate of meats our fondue practically ran out of steam and juice!! She also forgot about our champagne, gave us the check and walked away. We had to yet again ask for her because she took 10 hours long, then when she finally came back we explained we didn't receive our champagne and she was just like, "oh ya, i'll be back," didn't even apologized, was all nonchalant about it and we were like "really???" The service, at least from our waitress was ridiculous, we wished we had the other one sitting across from us who refilled our drinks, then maybe our experience would have been better.  Lastly, the decor!!!! Seriously for such a "high end" establishment, this place could use lots of remodeling... the decor is very 1990's and needs a make-up STAT!  We will give em props on the food, because it was DELICIOUS!! The salad wasn't a big deal, but the appetizers were AMAZING, same with the entrees, the meats were tender and succulent!! But alas, the lack of customer service from our waitress killed it for us, unfortunately.... :/  We wanted to love this place, but uh, we won't be coming back.

I'm from California where there is a Mexican food joint on every corner and when I first moved to Phoenix a year ago I've been on the hunt for a legit Mexican food place, not a Filiberto's or Macaios :P. Living in Ahwatukee, the only legit places I was able to find up until a month ago was in central/downtown Phoenix (Rosito's and La Canasta). As much as I love those two places, the drive sucks! After all this is Phoenix, there has to be a good place right by me!  Finally, I was advised to go to Los Taquitos from a friend of mine saying they have BOMB carne asada so I had to go see for myself as Elliot Rd is down the street from me (YES!). When I entered this place, it felt like home as it reminded me of one of my favorite places I used to go to back in Cali. It's clean, the staff is very friendly and their salsa is awesome! I personally like the green over the the red but they're both good! You can choose a la carte or a meal plate and they have a breakfast menu to boot! Now was the carne asada BOMB? YES! The carne asada was to die for, it was juicy and cooked just right. The tacos are small-ish but hit the right spot without putting you in a food coma afterwards. I usually have 2 or 3 (if im starving) and I'm in heaven. I go here about once a week for the tacos and I am never dissapointed. The burritos are excellent as well and are medium in size, again they don't serve the super XXXL burritos here which is fine with me because I don't like the food baby feeling I get after eating one of those bad boys! Oh and I forgot to add that the tacos are CHEAP, $1.15 a piece. If you want a 3 tacos plate, its 6 bucks, comes with rice and beans. So for the south phoenix/ahwatukee/chandler peeps, I recommend this place, its delicious, cheap, and clean as well!

This is a great mom n pop ran Italian restaurant, our server, can't remember his name (which is sad), was excellent! He knew the menu in and out and even suggested substituting certain meats to try "something different." My husband and I had the lasagna and it was delicious, and huge portions! The price was excellent too! The restaurant is small itself, but its kept clean and organized. We will be back again!

Okay, so I like fried chicken but I'm not the biggest fan, especially the sloppy greasy kind of fried chicken. I haven't been to KFC, Popeyes or Church's Chicken in years and my friend had been suggesting this place since I moved to Phoenix over 4 years ago. Let me just say, I can't believe it took me 4 years to come here, no seriously, I have to slap myself silly for that because LoLo's has renewed my faith in fried chicken. Seriously, I think that was the best fried chicken I've had in my life. The chicken was fried to a perfection, nice golden crisp with minimal grease, that's right, MINIMAL grease! I didn't think that was physically possible for fried chicken but LoLo's debunked that myth! I have the #7, which was 3 chicken wings and a waffle. I've already swooned over the fried chicken, now the waffle was ok, nothing too special, same stuff you get at a waffle house. I still can't get over the friend chicken though.....Anyways, I really liked the atmosphere here, on the south end of downtown, this place gets crazy packed for lunch. A lot of regulars come here and it's obvious from the waiters and waitresses hootin and hollering at the customers when they come in by their first names, kind of cool! Anyways, I will be back for more fried chicken for sure and am curious to try their cat fish!

This place is so beautiful, I would say if you're looking for a fairy tale type of wedding then this is the venue for you. My fiance and I toured the property which is separated into two venue areas. One is called the Provencal and the other is the secret garden or something along those lines. Both places are gorgeous, however we were leaning more towards the Provencal because it contains this beautiful fountain in the center and would make a very ideal outdoor spring wedding. The only reason why we didn't go with them was because a) The prices were a little too much above our budget, b) We didn't want to structure our wedding around beautiful weather and wanted to play safe in case our wedding were to get rained in. A very beautiful venue though!

This is a friendly bar that's in a very hidden random spot in Scottsdale, but then again Four Peaks is in a hidden random spot in Tempe... Anywho, my dislikes is that its pretty freakin small and that there's no patio, that's about it! Now on to my likes...I LOVE the variety and selection this place has to offer. They have amazing microbrewery selections from all over the country, even foreign countries as well as their own brews. I was shocked to see they had Lagunitas which is a Nor Cal microbrewery company and got quite excited! They have Dogfish and freakin Rogue! WOW! Now i'm quite into girlier beers so I will say that if you're looking for a light and sweet beer, the Orange Blossom is amazing, steer clear from this beer if you're into hoppy bitter beers. The food is okay, they serve thin crust pizza's and I think sandwiches (I got the pizza there). The pizza was good, but totally gave me the bottom bubbles later, hahahhahaa, i know TMI, so be careful! Overall, I would definitely go back, too bad it's quite a drive from me, open in Ahwatukee please!

Unfortunately, my hair stylist from hair pollution, Darcy, moved up to north Scottsdale and this would have been too much of the commute for me so i had to start looking for a new place and stylist. This place is absolutely awesome, the staff is super friendly and were kind enough to accommodate my sister who just needed her ends trimmed, oh and the stylist didn't even charge her for it! Anyways, they took me in right away and my hair stylist Rebecca is this cute brunette with long locks and I have long hair so I was very comfortable with her cutting my hair. She washed, cut, and styled my hair in 45 minutes and my hair looked fabulous and healthy oh and the price wasn't bad to boot! This is my new place!

FEZ BURGER!!!!!!! NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM!!!!! If you go here, you HAVE to try their FEZ burger! Talk about an orgasm in my mouth!!! I also had their Turkey burger, which was delicious! A little burnt on the outside, but nonetheless DELICIOUS! OMG, I can't wait to come back, my mouth is just salivating thinking about this place! Great atmosphere and great customer service!

SHAAAAAAAADYYYYYYY!!! The best way to describe this place! They are also a towing company that is contracted with condominium complex I live in. My boyfriend was parked in my garage, moved his car right outside my garage so we can move things around in and out of the garage into my place, 25 minutes later, car is gone, good bye, so long, adios. To top it all off, two doors down, there's a van that was parked in front of their garage for HOURS and nothing, not even a warning sticker was placed on their car. Lights were on in the house, we were making noise moving up and down the stairs and they couldn't even bother to knock on the door? Oh ya, there's no warning that the car would be towed if it was parked there too!  Not the first time this company has targeted my boyfriend's car. I mean, he doesn't drive the nicest car in the complex and his car is registered out of state, so his car is a target and they will try to find whatever reason to tow his car! He was legally parked in an uncovered parking spot in the complex and got a warning ticket, and there was NO REASON written other than your car will be towed. He called the company and the person had no clue what was going on and just said, "well I have to ask the guy in the field when he gets back." Next day, my boyfriend gets another warning, again NO REASON!!! I call this time stating I owned the property and if they warned his car for no reason again, I will file a complaint with the property manager. My boyfriend is scared to get his car towed so now I let him park it in my garage, and the minute he parks it outside for not even 30 minutes, it gets towed!!!   He's already called the place and left 3 messages, no return phone calls. I checked reviews on this place on other websites and people have all said this place is shady, shady, shady and a complete money making scheme. I will write another review later once I get to the bottom of this hot mess!

Yup, they sure are a money making scheme! My boyfriend along with my brother went to pay to get his car taken out. The minute they arrived to this towing place its in this giant lot with a trailer trash trailer parked in the the side. Everything was fenced off and of course no one was there. There were several people waiting outside to pick up their car and my boyfriend had to call the place three different times until finally a person comes out of the trailer to unlock the gate! WTF! My boyfriend went to go in and pay and the cost to get the car out was $300!!!! My brother tells the guy, hey dude, cut us some slack, we're war veterans (true story), can we get a discount? The guy goes, "I'll tell you what, pay $250, but i'll only do it with cash." WTH!!!!!! Shady, shady, shady place!!! My boyfriend just ended up paying the $250 cash, and the poor couple before them paid the $300 with card, this place is just a money making scheme I tell you! Avoid them at all costs!!

Very honest and trustworthy mechanic! As a female I know how mechanics can take advantage of us but Andre is such an honest mechanic! I've taken my car, a 2002 Toyota Camry in on multiple occasions and he only does what is needed. Back in 2012 my engine light went off and 2 solenoid panels needed to be repaired. Andre was not comfortable with repairing this part of the transmission so he recommended me to go to a transmission specific shop AND he never charged me for the diagnostic check to boot!! Seriously, this shop rocks!

Pretty good place! Coming from Cali, I have a penchant for Mexican food! I loved the taco combo, it was delicious! Huge portions too, wasn't hungry for hours! The location is good, right by downtown, and the place itself is adorable. The service was good, overall I'd go back for sure!

Wow, I've lived in Coronado for about 6 months already and I cannot believe this is my first visit!!   The bakery had a warm and inviting ambiance and the owner Isam, is just delightful. My husband and I arrived 10 minutes prior to closing and Isam was so inviting to us. We placed our orders, mine the falafel plate and my husband ordered the Lebanese chicken plate. On top of this we ordered a large hummus plate. Hypothetically speaking if we could have ordered the entire menu we would have! Everything sounded amazing on the menu.  Alas, the famous Lemonade, we just had to try, made with honey and rosewater. I told Isam that this was our first visit and I had to try his famous lemonade, and he lit up like a Christmas tree and said "this is your first time here?!? Lemonade on the house for the two of you." No way?! Ya way! The lemonade did not fail us, it was delicious!! So refreshing and the flavors worked lovely together!  Now onto our food plates....the hummus plate was delicious! They put ground beef cooked in olive oil, garlic and onions and sprinkled it on too of the hummus and boy was it delicious with the pita bread!! My falafel plate was amazing, the falafel nice and crisp on the outside and cooked and moist in the middle, it tasted amazing with the pita, tabouli and hummus together! My husband kept on raving about the chicken and how tender and flavorful it was, I had some and he had to take the plate away from me before I devoured it all! Haha!   We still had half of the hummus left and Isam came up to us and asked if we wanted an extra pita bread on the house to eat with the hummus! Uh, YAH!   Not only was the food delicious this place exceeds in the customer service department, Isam was just a delight and to give us lemonade and pita on the house, this place just rightfully owned their 5 stars!!

Whoa snap, its my first review on yelp, ever. Here we goooo! (Actually I just realized I reviewed some other place almost a year ago back in CA, whoops!)  I recently just moved to Phoenix from the Bay Area,CA about 6 months ago and I have been skeptical on getting my hair done out here because my hairstylist back in Cali was not only awesome, she was cheap! I flew back to Cali 3 months ago to visit and that was the last time I had my hair done, and lets say I was overdue for a cut!   Being a huge fan of Yelp, I yelped curly hair friendly salons, and what pops up? Hair Pollutions! I am pretty darn anal about my hair, because its thick, really wavy/curly, and just different (thanks to my mixed race background, Woot! Woot!) Anywho, first and foremost, if it weren't for my GPS, I probably wouldn't have found this place, the sign is somewhat small, but I did keep my eyes out for an artsy looking building which did help as well! The inside is a giant eye f**k, quite awesome I must say, really artsy, something to keep your eyes roaming around thats for sure! The staff is super friendly and music was cool as well. I booked an appointment on the same day, got there about 10 minutes early and Darcy, my stylist started on me right away which was cool.   Like I said before, I have weird hair, so I was scared like poop and crossing my fingers that this chick wouldn't butcher my long hair, but in the end, she did a fantastic job! She took her time, asked a LOT of questions to make sure I was getting what I wanted, and incorporated a little bit of her style which was cool! I must say I was freaking out at first cuz the razor cuts I normally get back in CA were like half an inch, not much, but Darcy was taking out like 1 to 2 inches (it looked like it!) but when it was all set and done, my hair came out awesome! The cost wasn't too bad, only about 8 bucks more than what I paid back in CA, it was $45, wash, cut, and style (I normally get charged even more cuz i have a lot of hair! So that was cool!)  I'll be back in 6-8 weeks this time for sure! Thanks Darcy, you did a great job!!!

I am absolutely astounded that this "Mexican Restaurant" has 3 and 1/2 stars on yelp! The only reason why they get a star from me is the bar atmosphere, they have a great bar with good happy hour deals, but that's it.   Lets begin with the food, salsa and chips...absolute crap. The salsa tastes like canned crap from a 99 cents store, bland and just CRAP, I can go to Filiberto's across the street and find salsa 10 times better than what's at Loco's. The chips are salty as h***, tastes as if they poured the entire salt shaker into the basket, VERY SALTY, i'm not a goat, but thanks! I've been here for plenty of taco Tuesdays (mainly for the drinks). The tacos run between 1-2 bucks. The dollar tacos are shredded chicken or beef and the 2 dollar ones are shrimp, mahi mahi, and new york steak.I've tried all of the tacos, the shredded chicken and beef always dry and bland, same with the mahi mahi! The only tolerable tacos are the shrimp and new york steak, but once you go to a REAL Mexican restaurant, it makes those tacos look like poop! I've had their chimichanga's, again like another poster said about the beef, they put ground beef instead of shredded like what I expected and it sucked! I refuse to try anything from there again! If I go here it's only for happy hour once in a blue moon, but that's about it. Want to go to a real Mexican Restaurant try Los Taquitos off of 48th st and Elliot and La Canasta in Downtown, those are real Mexican restaurants.   You know there is something wrong with a "Mexican Restaurant" when the hamburgers are better than the "Mexican food" they serve. Nuff said.

From the moment my fiance and I stepped foot in this place we were IN LOVE! I will be getting married at Inspirador next March and we're super excited! The venue itself is gorgeous as it contains an outdoor and indoor option for the ceremony, a beautifully decorated reception area and the chic looking Tryst art gallery that can be utilized for cocktail hour!  When we first met with Andrea to take a look at the venue, she blew us away! She wanted to get to know us, how we met, the proposal, and she wanted to get a feel as to what kind of wedding we were looking for. From the minute we met, she exemplified customer service, she indeed 'sold' us the venue. We have kept in contact and she has been answering my e-mails promptly which shows her dedication in this industry! The price for the venue was a little above our projected budget, however the services provided in the all inclusive package was a must. Oh and you have the option to bring your own alcohol rather than pay per individual, love it!  We are so looking forward to our wedding next March and I will be writing an update as far as how everything went! Woohoo, can't wait! :)

Cheese curds, chicken and waffles, Mac N Cheese with lobstah, oh the list goes on and on with this amazing restaurant. Nestled in the cute Coronado Historic District, the Tuck Shop has once again struck a positive cord with this Yelper. I've been here 3 times and have yet to be disappointed. The service is excellent and the food is to die for! Their chicken and waffles rock, although I will say that LoLo's edges them out on the fried chicken part, the cheddar crusted waffles and the corn and pineapple medley are superb! I will be back again and again and again and again and again and again and again......you get my drift

I just wanted to say that I was contacted by the owner last week and they gave me a full refund including tip that was given! The owner also offered me a free bikini and brow wax, no pressure just gave me the offer! I have to say that they are very professional and they far exceed my expectations in the customer service department. I just may have to take their offer! Thanks Glow Skin & Body Studio!

First off, the environment is really chill and laid back, it has this industrial modern feel to it. I love the lighting, lots of light and they have a nice outdoor area with a fireplace to boot! Now the coffee...their chai lattes are freakin awesome and my boyfriend had regular coffee which he enjoyed as well. Moving on to the food, I had the farmers omelet and it was amazingly delicious for a vegetarian omelet. My boyfriend had this breakfast sandwich, can't think of the name off the top of my head, something "gallo" but he thought it was amazing and it looked amazing as well. It's a little pricey but the food is well prepared, very healthy and good portions (not too much, not too little). I love how they support local products and they serve microbrews!!   The downside?? THE FLIES! Like someone mentioned below I was doing the hillside wave to swat the flies! My boyfriend and I rolled up the newspaper we were reading to kill a really annoying fly! There were several flies, I don't know if it was because we were sitting by the window, but they were annoying!  Overall I would go back because I love the atmosphere, the food is delicious and healthy, and the coffee is yummy!

Damn, you want some awesome tacos, burros, quesadillas, or tortas?! This is your place! Ever since Guy Fieri stepped foot in this place, it gets really busy now. It's a small place, so expect a wait unless you go during off times (avoid lunch and dinner). The salsa bar is incredible, so many different variety of salsas from cilantro, pecan, to a delicious jicama or a bomb pico de gallo. The quesadillas aren't your typical ones, they fry them entirely that it almost looks like a empanada/quesadilla hybrid but they're so good! It's true about what they say about the horchata, it's the best I've tasted. They put pecans and chopped fruit in the horchata giving it some extra flavor a but its so delicious. My favorite tacos are the Shark tacos! Try them! Only reason why I give them 4 stars is because the service is alright. Sometimes they are not staffed adequately and it takes forever to get your order in, other than that, it's a great Mexican food joint!

This is a family owned wedding/event venue that offers all inclusive wedding packages that are very competitive price wise. I must say that the two young girls that run the place are super friendly and care about what kind of wedding you are looking for. This was a breath of fresh air after dealing with Tre Bella (see review) since they were super nice. The wedding venue itself is beautiful, however for the amount of people we are expecting to have, we thought the space itself would be too big. I will say that they have this beautiful ceremony area below the venue,  and they are contracted with the Mesa Arts center, so they will set up your wedding ceremony there as well!  We decided not to go with them because we chose another venue that was closer to home, that's all. If we lived in Mesa, we probably would have chose them!   If you're expecting to have a large wedding, this place can easily accommodate for it and the wedding coordinators are very friendly, prices are good as well!

So I drive up to this place thinking that it was opened until 6pm. Mind you it was 5:35 and I began cleaning junk out of my car to place it in the trunk and as I shut the door I noticed the men were placing cones across the entrance! Crap! Were they closing??!! I asked the gentlemen what time they closed and he nicely replied, 5:30. At this time it was 5:43 and I'm completely face palming myself and said 'oh man!' The gentleman smiled and said, it's okay we'll wash your car! What?! Really?!! Even 15 minutes after you closed?!! Yup, they took my car in and washed it throughly scraping the bird crap off my back windshield that was murdered 2 days before. 10 bucks and 15 minutes my car was bling bling, tires shined, windows cleaned in and out, and car vacuumed very well! Will be back for sure! Awesome service!!

I did not utilize copper square kitchen to cater my wedding however I wanted to write a review in regards to their customer service. Griselda Chacon who is the manager here is absolutely awesome. She is super friendly and extremely helpful. There was a list of cheap referrals in regards to linens, cake, DJ's, etc that she copied for me because she recently had her wedding a year prior. The prices are VERY competitive in regards to the surrounding hotels (Sheraton, Westin, etc). So if you're looking for catering services for roughly 100-125 under $7000, then check them out. The only reason why we didn't book with them is because we chose an all inclusive venue that we couldn't pass up that was closer to home. If I were getting married in Downtown, I would go with Copper Square Kitchen at the Hyatt. Ask for Griselda!

I was thoroughly impressed with this place! Took me by surprise from the very beginning! I have always wanted to eat here and after dragging my husband, kicking and screaming I did and neither of us regretted it! Where to begin??  The Service: Excellent! When we walked into this place, it was dead (which was worrisome), but our waiter greeted us with a smile and sat us down, explained to us that it was happy hour (double like) and showed us the drink menu and the roll menu. Every question we had about the beverages and food the waiter had an answer and even provided great suggestions!  The Food: So at Rice Paper the apps are $6, highly recommend the Fire Cracker shrimp (especially if you like something with a spicy kick to it). The calamari with the dipping sauce is delicious as well! The rolls are $1 off and we ate the Spicy Asian, Surf n Turf and the Salmon roll which were all delicious! We also had the chicken noodle pho to top everything off and that was yummy, the broth was really really good!   The ambiance rocks, love how the place is decorated, very warm, inviting, and modern. My husband and I are definitely returning to this place!!

This place is EXCELLENT!! My husband and I met up with a family member of mine here for a late lunch and I ordered the turkey bacon sandwich with chipotle sauce and it was absolutely delicious!! The service was great, employees very friendly. Since it was near closing they threw in free dessert which were these raspberry chocolate cupcakes which were to die for. It's unfortunate that we don't live close to this establishment because we would go here all the time!!! Hopefully we will visit some time soon when we're in the area!

This is tough, because I REALLY wanted to like this place! What killed it for me? The lack of professionalism that was presented when my fiance and I came to look at this venue. I will admit that we were 10 minutes late to our appointment, however I do not think this warrants being treated like a herd of cattle.  First when I called the venue to make an appointment whoever picked up the line sounded as if they were in a rush and not even interested in making the appointment which was the first turn off. Upon arrival, we walked into another entrance thinking it was the main entrance, then we were re-directed by an employee to the adjacent door. As we walked out there was (I don't even remember her name), the wedding coordinator waiting. She quickly greeted us then had us sit down as she began to talk about the venue.   Usually when you want to sell the venue you run, you'd think you would see someone with a little enthusiasm and fire explaining why their venue is so amazing. Well, we didn't get that from this individual. What did we get? A quick 10 minute spiel about what they do and the services provided and 3 wedding books shoved in our faces as examples then a quick 10 minute tour of the place. That's it, no effort, no emotion, no interest in wanting to get to 'know us' and get a feel for what kind of wedding we would like to have, just a quick, here is the place, goodbye. She was very snooty and acted as if she was not in the mood to showcase the venue.  So why two stars instead of zero? One star is for the venue itself. It is very chic, modern, yet elegant. The reception area is beautifully decorated and where the ceremony is held is beautiful as well! There are many ways one can decorate this place! The other star is the PRICE. This venue offers all inclusive packages at unbeatable prices. I mean an all inclusive package where they provide virtually everything for roughly 100 guests is $9495.00 taxes and gratuity included!!! That's a steal, trust me, I've looked into a TON of venues, you will not find an all inclusive price as cheap as this.   Honestly, if my fiance and I were the only individuals funding our wedding, then we probably would have considered this place (more than likely, VEGAS). However, given the type of customer service that was displayed, we took our business elsewhere.

Prickly pear iced tea, I REPEAT TRY THE PRICKLY PEAR ICED TEA. RIGHT. NOW. The chai tea blew my mind, might have surpassed Lux's (just might have). Tried an apple fritter ball and went to heaven! Okay on a serious note, this is a cute little vegan coffee shop that provides vegan pastries, ice cream (yes to my lactose intolerant friends!), and food. The shop is cute, the two girls that were running the show behind the counter were kickin butt and takin names since they were slammed and they were super helpful to us Nami virgins (my husband and I). We will definitely be back to try the ice cream because we kept on drooling seeing all the people walk by with these amazing looking cups nestled in their hands. OH JYAHHHH.....

They were open for Cinco de Mayo, very understaffed! Especially for Cinco! It took FOREVER TO EVEN GET WATER. Our friends had arrived 45 minutes earlier and had just gotten their margaritas. So my husband and I ordered ours, 15 minutes passed, nothing, 20, 25, 30 minutes and counting. We finally were able to flag a server down and he was like "oh your drinks should be waiting, they are probably at the bar waiting right now." We said "no thanks, can we just get the checks please?" Absolutely terrible service, but they were extremely understaffed.

I came here to do a mani/pedi with a groupon and needless to say I am an addict now! Vanessa rocks my nail world! She is super OCD when it comes to nails and makes sure every single nail is the perfect length, shape, and is EVEN. She takes her time and pays attention to detail! I've seen her about 3 more times since August! I absolutely love the atmosphere and everybody is super nice at the salon! I am curious to try their hair services now!

Yay for local ice cream shops!! This place rocks! After a quick visit to their beloved jobot's next door we had to hit this place up especially since it was a friggen hot August day! Such a cute place with great selections of ice cream. They make their ice cream from scratch! That's what I'm talking about! I had the strawberry cilantro which was a seasonal one, and it was very quenching and delicious for the hot summer day, kind of reminded me of a Mexican paleta. My husband got the banana and he loved it, there were some chunks in it too! They serve the ice cream in Chinese take out boxes or cones. Did I mention that they're open until midnight?! AWESOME! We will be back for sure!!

Why open at 10am when you're not going to be there? 10am, My husband was standing outside waiting for it to open, two ladies walked inside (assuming they were the cleaning crew or something) and one of them told him, "Sorry, he's late as usual." Meanwhile, I was next door at Ollie Vaughns getting my breakfast on, ordered my food, ate, drank finished up and when I walked outside 38 min later, my husband was STILL standing there!! Not only was the barber late, they were 38 min late and counting. Talk about a horrible first impression! The sad part is we live in the neighborhood and I recommended this place to my husband based on the yelp reviews! My husband is forgiving so he may try again in the future but I will forewarn people to not come when it opens because they are late "as usual". Bad business!

I've been to Paz three times, and all three times have been exceptional. Great service and good food. I've only had a couple of tacos, the fish taco, carnitas, and carne asada. The fish taco was moist and it had this tartar type of sauce drizzled on top which was delicious! The carnitas, which I was a little apprehensive about getting was juicy and had a slight layer of fat which gave it some extra flavor. The carne asada was flavorful and delicious. Out of all the tacos the fish taco was my favorite! Love the decor of the place, the day of the dead paintings look like they are Lalo Cota's work which is a local artist! Over all I give it four big stars! I will be back!

One word. AMAZING! From the minute you walk through the door you're greeted by the friendly and generous Abdul. We sat down and started reading the menu from the wall. Abdul went up to us immediately and asked us what we wanted to drink, he suggested the mint tea and it was delicious! He also brought us fresh warm flat bread and this small plate of sautéed chopped carrots which was delicious! I ordered the lamb cous Cous and my husband ordered the chicken Cous Cous. My lamb was amazing, the meat literally melted off the bone, it was so tender and juicy. My husbands chicken was also juicy and flavored to perfection. As we were enjoying our lunch Abdul offered us the date shake. Do it, it is delicious!! When we received our tab, he only charged us for the two entrees!!! We obviously left a large tip for the amazing service and food! Thanks Abdul, we will return!

Went to Duza's grand opening day today and it exceeded my expectations. First off the location is in the same building as the former Astor House, not much has change decor wise, except it's a little more of a rustic French take versus urban mid-century like the Astor House. Everybody from the cook to the cashier greeted us as we walked in and we grabbed a menu. It's a paper menu for now as they are rolling with this for about a month to see how the customers feel about their menu. I had The Hash which is essentially a meat bowl (prime rib, sausage, ham, etc) sautéed with an assortment of veggies with two sunny side eggs on top. The meat was seasoned perfectly and not over salted (my pet peeve) and very tender. My husband had the Shepherd's pie (I think that's what it was called, Shepherd's something) and his was delicious as well! His consisted of bacon, prime rib, sausage, avocado and a Gruyere kind of cheese on a flaky biscuit, so good! They have different pastries, coffee options as well as fruit infused water and juices. The entire menu sounded delicious so it was hard to pick something! I was very impressed considering it was the grand opening and will be back for more.
