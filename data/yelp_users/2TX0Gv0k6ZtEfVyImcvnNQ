You get what you pay for. I've never been even slightly disappointed. I've been coming here with a good friend for a few years, and it's a MUST every time I come back to town for a visit.   On our most recent visit I had the sushi platter entree. It comes with 8 pieces of nigiri sushi and a maki roll in the middle. The salmon nigiri is incredible. Eat it slowly.  SAVOR it!  I'm thinking about going back just for that one more time before I head back to Arizona.   Also, their desserts are exquisite.  The dessert menu changes, but again, I've never even come close to feeling disappointed.  I don't care much for sweets but the dessert here is SO good that I order something every time.    P.S. Don't wear a short skirt in case you get seated at a tatami table!

We visited the stand for this restaurant at the farmer's market downtown.  We sampled their zucchini lasagna, eggplant lasagna, two kinds of eggplant rollatini, meatballs, peppers and sausage and bruschetta.  Overall, I was really impressed, and it can be difficult to impress me with Italian food.  Their eggplant and zucchini were sliced so thin that they practically melted in your mouth, which is my favorite way to eat it.  We ended up buying some rollatini and zucchini lasagna to take home, and we're curious about trying out the restaurant sometime soon.  More to follow...

Food is average, not at all a value for the price. My steak had almost no flavor.  Service was average. The waitress wasn't as friendly as her cowboy hat and boots led me to believe she'd be, nor was she very attentive.  They were mostly able to accommodate my food allergies.  The rice has butter, the corn is pre-buttered and for whatever reason I wasn't able to sub fries for my rice, but whatever.  The steamed veggies I had were good, and obviously way healthier than fries anyway.  But this place earns its two stars based on the fun "extras": a slide that our kids loved, a kids menu that doubles as a hat that looks like bull horns, a guy that makes balloon animals, a band (that happened to play some of my fave Willie Nelson & Johnny Cash songs), and a spectacular view (really, all of this is where the money goes when you buy that $15 cheeseburger).  A few final words about the bull at the entrance: Really, the last thing I want to see before I eat a meal of beef is a sad, lonely bull lying in a little pen that stanks of bullshit.

When we arrived, my husband was a little discouraged by the number of elderly people that were waiting in line to get in.  But after our experience we realized this is a great place for a break in the monotony of multi-generational family dinners.    The pizza earns 2-3 stars from me.  I'm more of a Pizza Bianco/Humble Pie/La Bocca kind of girl.  Not a big fan of the doughy, over-cheesed kind of pizza.  But, that's what they have here, so that's what we ate.  Really nothing special, but not horrible either.  Their salad bar is pretty standard; also nothing special.  We didn't try any of their sandwiches or specialty dishes.  However, the entertainment was unlike anything I've ever seen before, and we all really enjoyed it.  The organ pipes are quite a spectacle: a countless number of them, two stories high, all throughout the dining hall.  There are drums and bongos on the walls and bells and xylophones hanging from the ceiling.  The organ itself rotates on a platform at the front and center of the dining hall.  I bet your organ doesn't do that.  (On that note, I'll inform you that the "giant organ" and "huge pipes" lend themselves to a number of inappropriate jokes.  So, have fun with that!)  Being the holiday season, we heard a lot of Christmas music both familiar and unfamiliar.  My stepdaughter was elated when they played her current theme song, "All I want for Christmas is My Two Front Teeth."  And all of the kids loved the "It's a Small World/Mickey Mouse Club" theme song medley with the banner of Mickey hanging from the ceiling and "Under the Sea" with blue lights on the disco ball and bubbles at the end.  Personally, I was a fan of the Phantom of the Opera medley.    The organist has a request box at the front of the stage that he checks every so often and he recognizes birthdays and special occasions and plays songs for them.    We're looking forward to doing another family dinner here sometime. Between grandma, adult kids and grandkids (ages 1-7), our gang had a really good time here!

My family and I go out to Schnepf Farms a few times a year, usually once during peach season and once for the Pumpkin Festival in the fall.  Either way, our kids always enjoy it and we come back with something delicious to eat.    On our most recent trip, we picked some little peaches that were really sweet and juicy.  They don't spray any chemicals on their orchards so we were able to eat the peaches right off the tree, which our girls think is pretty cool.  They had the train running and the U-pick garden open.  I was able to FILL a plastic grocery bag with fresh organic spinach for $1.50.  Sure, I had to pick it myself while my husband took the girls on the giant slide and to the petting zoo, but the vegetables share their space with some beautiful flowers.  Who could really complain about picking fresh vegetables while looking at a field of gorgeous flowers and listening to their kids giggle in the distance??  Certainly not me.  There are pros and cons to visiting during festivals.  The pros:  Food stands, rides, music, shows.  The cons: lines, entrance fees, hoards of people.  I prefer going when there's no festival taking place.  The kids can have a little more freedom to run around and play, and we don't have to stand and wait in line for the hay ride, or train or anything.  Unless you live in the (far) east valley, it's quite a hike to get to Schnepf Farm.  Every time we've gone, my husband or I inevitably says, "Wow, this is SO far away!  Are we almost there!? I don't remember it being this far!"  But it is.  And it's worth it.

Dr. Cannon has been my daughter's pediatrician since she was born.  Although he has never expressed any negativity at our decision to delay/decline our daughter's vaccinations, some of the nurses have been a little snooty about it.  From our first visit, Dr. Cannon has always been very thorough in answering all our questions, and even answering questions we didn't even know we had.  The office has a sick-child waiting room and a well-child waiting room.  I'd never seen that before, but it's so sensible.  Even though we moved from Scottsdale to Tempe, we aren't changing doctors.  Dr. Cannon is obviously experienced and I respect his professional opinion.

Being located in one of my favorite shopping centers in Tempe, this groomer is perfectly situated.  I remembered that it was there and had some errands to run so I figured I'd give it a try.  Now, I'm a loyal customer.  I bathe my dog, Rooney, myself but she won't let me get anywhere near her nails, so I have to take her SOMEWHERE.  I used to take her to Petsmart and it would cost I think $8 to clip them or $11-12 to have them use the grinder on her nails, but this place only charges $7 and they'll do both!  They're all really friendly and are always cool with me running over to the other awesome stores in this complex while Rooney gets her pedi.  One last thing, they don't take credit cards.  Cash or check only.

I chose this dentist because they're walking distance from our house, and I know Drs Ahn & Perez through my former place of employment.  As far as the whole dental experience, this place was fine, but I'm a freak of nature that loves going to the dentist so unless I walk out the door with bleeding gums, I'm gonna be content with the exam and cleaning.  However, my problem with this office is that they don't take our insurance, and they neglected to inform us of this until AFTER they had already done $400+ worth of cleanings and exams on myself and my husband.  A receptionist should know which insurance policies they accept and they should be up front in telling you if yours isn't one of them.  I had my appointment and then my husband had his THREE WEEKS later.  PLENTY of time to call and say "Hey, by the way, your insurance won't cover all the services since we're not one of their providers."  Seems a little shady to me.    So, if they take your insurance, great!  Book it.  But be SURE they do before you let them do your exam.

Classic Pittsburgh.  The hill is super steep and the view from the top is fantastic.  It was a bit pricier than I was expecting, but I'll happily pay the $4 per person for a round trip just to make sure this landmark stays around.

The first time we ate here, we went with a friend of executive chef Beau MacMillan and got special treatment.  We were served four different dishes of the most exquisitely prepared fish I'd ever eaten, followed by desserts that were to die for.   The next time we ate at sunset, and the views of Paradise Valley as the sun is setting are stunning.  The prices are comparable to other high-end restaurants, but the view and atmosphere here can't be beat.  They can accommodate a gluten free diet, too.  Always a bonus when my family comes to town.  The food is always fresh and flavorful and Beau Mac is an engaging and entertaining chef to talk with.  I always have fun at Elements, and look forward to going again for the next special occasion or family visit.

We love their beer, and their food is pretty good as far as bar/brewery food goes.  It's fine for kids (ours is a toddler) as long as you're sitting in the ONE section that isn't so close to the patio that it's smoky, or solely high-top tables, but otherwise you'll end up like us, taking turns following a toddler around the restaurant.  But what the hell, I guess nothing's that bad with a nice cold beer in your hand.

I had heard good things about Lo Cascio, had heard that they were voted "Best Italian restaurant in Scottsdale" and when I walked in and saw the old Italian couple walk out from the kitchen I thought I was in luck!  Wrong.  The food was WAY over priced, and not that great.  Maybe I'm just used to (spoiled by?) MY old Italian grandma's cooking, but what I ate was not all that fantastic.  Not  "Best in Scottsdale" fantastic.  I live in Scottsdale.  My Italian cooking is better.  We ordered from the "smaller portions" menu, and while it WAS a perfect sized portion, it was not worth what we paid for it.  Also, they put sesame seeds on their bread.  Sesame seeds in an Italian restaurant??  Why?  Italian bread (GOOD Italian bread) is delicious without adding anything.  Their bread had a soft crust (again, covered in sesame seeds for some reason) and the inside was on the mushy side.  Not the hard crusted, spongy Italian bread to which I've always been accustomed.   One thing I did like about this restaurant was that instead of serving you a side of pasta with your entree, you have the option to sub it with fried zucchini, which I did, and it was pretty good.  Although it's hard to screw something up when you bread it and fry it.    Bottom line, we won't be visiting here again.

I've taken my sweeper (yes, sweeper; not vacuum) for repairs here twice.  I have a cheap sweeper from Target.  I think it cost $70-80 when I got it 3 years ago.  The first time it was a cheap fix ($30) and the sweeper ran great afterward.  The most recent time, it was a more costly repair ($50) and I wish he would have called before he spent the time and parts on the repair because I probably would have just bought a new sweeper instead of having the repair.

I give it a 5 even though there are surely better amusement parks out there.  However, I've made so many memories at this amusement park, I don't think it could get any better for me, personally.  This place is classic.  Even in my mid-twenties I felt giddy as I walked through the tunnel to enter the park.    PROS: -Wooden coasters- the Jack Rabbit, the Racer, the Thunderbolt.... classic bumpy, creaky, bounce out of your seat fun! -Potato patch french fries (LOTS of vinegar and Heinz ketchup!) -Classic rides like the swings, the merry go round, the paratrooper, the turtle, the turnpike and gran prix, Noah's Ark - Funnel cakes - Fresh squeezed lemonade - Kiddie land   CONS: -Small-ish lockers.  We had a hard time fitting our cooler. -The new Noah's Ark.  What happened to the whale's tongue?  And why is it so scary now?  Our kids were pretty freaked out and didn't really enjoy it at all. -Garfield's Nightmare.  AWFUL.  A waste of 45 minutes of my life.  They took out the Old Mill and disgraced the park with a cheesy, slow moving ride that tactlessly promotes brand name sodas, potato chips and other junk food, which, surprise, surprise! they sell at a stand at the end of the ride.  Pathetic.  And what's with the camera at the end of the ride?  All they're going to catch on that camera are people sleeping or being bored to tears.  If you haven't picked up on my subtle hints, let me spell it out for you: DON'T GO ON THIS RIDE! -No more Magic Carpet or ferris wheel.  Boooo. -Trashy young girls walking around in bikini tops with their flabby guts hanging out over their shorts.  Gross.  Look in a mirror or find some honest friends.  Nobody wants to see that.

We frequent the Pita Jungle more than any other restaurant in the valley.  It's a great place to go for fresh, healthy, delicious food.  Undoubtedly my favorite restaurant around.  I love the decor of the Tempe, Scottsdale, and Chandler locations, but I think the Desert Ridge location strayed and tries to be a little bit too posh.  Regardless, the food is still delicious.  Try the red pepper hummus and the baba ganoush.  And the tablouli salad with hummus and feta cheese.  And if they still have the masala chicken special, eat that too.  You can't go wrong.

I love this bookstore.  I took my one-year old yesterday because we had to get out of the house while we had people there working.  I needed something to DO with her, and it had to be close to someplace good for lunch... Changing hands was PERFECT.  Our morning went like this: My little one playing on the train table (literally ON it... ugh, kids!), up the step to look pull a dozen books off the shelf, look through them, then back to the train table to throw everything onto the floor with an "uh-oh" as each one dropped, back up the steps to check out their stuffed animals and toys, all the while I'm doing damage control and cleaning up after her, as I scan the shelves for some used books at my step daughter's reading level... SUCCESS!  I found a cute early reader for her for $1.50!  After our lunch at Wildflower, I came back to Changing Hands and got some adorable thank  you notes to send out for my daughter's first birthday party.  All in all, it was a fun, productive morning and I can't wait to spend another morning here with my daughter.

I stopped here once before, a long long time ago after it had just opened... only to find it was closed during it's normal business hours.  Probably just a fluke; a new business blunder.  I meet with a "green" moms group from time to time and today we had a lunch date set up for Essence.  I wasn't expecting more than the usual "bakery" lunch food: chicken or tuna salad on croissants, simple deli style sandwiches.  But oh! was I pleasantly surprised to find that their food was seriously high quality and locally grown and raised, to boot!  Their burgers are made from grass fed beef (that's what I'm trying next time), their produce comes from a local farm.  I had the grilled cheese (mozzerella, tomato, basil) and it practically melted in my mouth.  It took a lot of restraint to save half for my husband.  I also had the soup of the day- bean soup with herbs, and it too was delicious.  I shared that with my baby.  The only thing I was able to consume by myself was the salad.  Now, I was in such a hurry because I had to eat, chat and leave within 30 minutes of ordering because we had an appointment with our realtor.  I remember thinking "damn, this salad is delicious" but I can't remember what it was that made it so good.  But take my word for it:  the mixed greens salad is good.    As I said, I met with a moms group, and we ran into a bit of a problem in that the restaurant only has one high chair.  The bigger kids did fine in regular chairs, but I think they may have opted for a high chair had my daughter not been using the only one.    We arrived around 11, and were there for about 45 minutes.  The place started to get packed around 11:30 and by the time I was wrapping up my meal, it was crowded and noisy, and the other moms and I were talking very loudly in order to hear one another.    I was told good things about their breakfast.... that'll be my next trip!

My husband and I had breakfast here over the weekend.  We shared the "Big Breakfast" and Eugenia's Organic Hot Breakfast Cereal.  The big breakfast was great- the schreiner's sausage is AWESOME.  We practically fought over it.  The eggs were fluffy and delicious, but the garlic mashed potato cake was a bit of a let down.  It's about the size of a hockey puck, and it does taste good... there was just not much too it.  Slightly crunchy on the outside, but then it's just mashed potatoes on the inside.  I'm much more a fan of homefries with my breakfast.  But maybe that's just me.  The hot cereal was DELICIOUS.  We mostly got this for our daughter, and although she's only 10 months old, she let us know that she loved it (banging on the table, leaning toward it, reaching for it, and lots of "mmmmmmmmm"s).  It really was delicious- not too thick, not too runny,   very cinnamon-y, the yogurt added a nice touch of tangy-ness, and the pecans on top gave it a great crunch to round out the texture of each bite.  I will absolutely be eating this again next time we go.  And I think I can say the same for my daughter!

I'm so happy to have found out about this farmer's market.  We buy all of our (TRULY free range, grass fed, pastured) meats and (local organic) produce here, and some of our cheese and bread as well.  We also started buying our (grass fed) eggs here, but you have to get there early to get them because they often sell out by about 10.  The eggs are expensive (5$ a dozen!) but SO worth it.  Crack one open and take a look- the yolks are a deep orangish yellow from all the nutrients the hens retain by not choking down corn and grain all day long. We buy most of our produce from One Windmill Farm and I've almost always been happy with it.  The only time I've been slightly let down was this past week when I bought some spring mix lettuce and when I was preparing it Sunday evening I noticed it smelled "not so fresh."  But we ate it anyway and it was fine.  Maybe that's just how they smell when they don't have the chlorine bath that the bagged stuff at the grocery store has.  If you get there early, there's a super long line to wait in to pay.  But again, it's worth it.  Better for me to stand in line than have the produce drive across state lines to get to my dinner table.

We LOVE this place.  I read about it in Raising Arizona Kids, and we decided to go looking for it the other night.  We got a little lost (it helps to know the address and/or write down directions when looking for a new place).  My husband and I shared an ice cream sandwich, and we ordered two ollie-cakes to go.  While we sat and ate our sandwich we talked with one of the owners, who was super friendly.  The ice cream sandwich was delicious: a generous amount of ice cream stuffed between double chocolate cookies.  My husband thought the cookies were a little too hard to bite into, but I didn't think it was much of an issue.   Since we didn't want to COMPLETELY ruin our appetite for dinner with our ice cream sandwich, we each ordered an ollie-cake to go.  These were the primary reason we wanted to visit the bakery.  My husband got a chocolate cupcake with chocolate icing and I got white cake with lemon icing.  They were both incredible!  I'm not generally a fan of desserts, cakes and the like, usually because they're TOO sweet, but these were perfect.  And the chocolate icing was BEYOND perfect.  Probably the best chocolate icing I've ever tasted.  Organic ingredients, local eggs, family owned, friendly people.... we'll be back again, and again, and again.  Oh, and we're definitely getting cakes here for our daughter's first birthday in November!

When it comes to shopping, I avoid going to this place at all costs.  Parking almost always sucks, and I guess I don't frequent it enough to know which end to park on to get to the one store I need to visit.  On my most recent visit, I tried using the interactive directory to help me find my way, and it was a miserable failure.  Yeah, it's very cool that it shows your little footprints walking from your current location to your destination, but it doesn't have anything labeled on the rest of the map to give you any sort of point of reference as to which way you should go.  Good idea in theory.  Maybe the next model will be better.    They have a lot of the standard chain sit down restaurants and some standard mall food court type of places but I'm generally not a fan of those so I've never eaten there.  The only thing that earns this place an additional star is the little splash pad they have for kids.  I've brought my stepdaughter here numerous times to play and look forward to bringing our little one this summer.

My husband and I have been stopping here on the weekends recently.  The staff is always super friendly and their drinks are great.  I've never like coffee.  Ever.  I've tried it a couple times throughout my life and it's just never done it for me, so I've always been a tea girl.  THEN, my husband and I went to Cartel one day and while he was tending to our toddler, I went to put some cream in his iced coffee.  I had a little bit of an overflow dilemma, and there were no towels or any potential clean up devices in sight.  So I was forced to take a sip to prevent the spill... and I was shocked and pleasantly surprised that I actually LIKED the coffee!  It wasn't bitter or nasty at all.  Very smooth and delicious, and creamy because of, well, the cream.  My poor husband only got to drink about half his coffee that day, and then deal with me being wired for the next few hours.  The usual tea I get there is always great, too.  I've only tried one so far, the black mango pineapple (or something along those lines) and it's delish!  Mildly sweet and fruity, extremely yummy.    I like the way the interior is designed, with bike tires and interesting photos on the walls.  My toddler loves to look around and inquire about what everything is.  There's never been a long wait and we've been there at different times on weekend mornings.  Early-ish, and later towards the afternoon.  Never overly crowded, never empty.  We'll be back again and again because now I'm hooked on their iced coffee.  It only took 27 years.

Two or three times a year, when my dad comes to town, we have to go eat a chicken fried steak at the Ranch House.  We heard about this place from our old roommate who is a chef, and my dad couldn't wait to go try it.  Typically a healthy eater, my dad loves to splurge on something artery-clogging from time to time.  I'm just glad I get to go along for the ride.  The first time we went, my dad noticed a not-so-svelte man sitting at a table in front of the window.  My dad looked toward him and said "Ooohh.  This is gonna be GOOD!"  He was right.  The chicken fried steak is tender and juicy, the eggs have always been perfectly fine and the gravy is so thick and creamy I can feel it taking years off my life.  Pancakes are an easy kid-pleaser, so everyone comes out full and content.    I'm glad I get to go here once or twice a year and that's enough for me.

This is definitely our favorite place to go on Mill.  Their pizzas are great, the sangria is yummy and the staff has been friendly and attentive every time we've gone.  Try the garden pizza- the blue and cheddar cheeses make it stand out compared to other veggie pizzas I've tried.  Our friends were raving about the Mulberry street sandwich, so that's on our "to-do" list for the next trip.  My favorite of the bruscettas is the proscuitto with fig and mascarpone... creamy, salty and smoky and slightly sweet... it's so delicious!

We took my dad for the first time tonight.  My dad is Italian and a tough critic when it comes to pizza... He officially declared that we would be eating here at least once every time he comes to town.  We all agreed it's better than his former favorite, Humble Pie.  His initial observation was that the atmosphere was great- and he's right.  The decor is simple, hip and classy.  The restaurant is spacious and not over crowded with tables.  However, the tables themselves weren't quite big enough to hold all the food we ordered.  Once we all had a glass of water, beers for my dad and husband and sangria for myself, there wasn't a whole heck of a lot of room on the table left for food and serving plates.    Every time we've been here the staff has been wonderful to my daughter.  Both of the male servers we've had have totally doted on her.  There was plenty of space for her to toddle around our table and the high chairs have always been nice and clean (there's nothing worse than a crusty high chair).  We asked if they could bring her anything to snack on while we waited for our antipasti and pizzas so they brought her a little side of pear slices, crackers and cheese while we waited for our food.  Perfect!  Kept her happily nibbling til more food came.    The antipasti we ordered as a starter was delicious!  The giant hunks of elephant garlic were roasted til they were soft, sweet and tender.  And the proscuitto-wrapped goat cheese was great.  We had a debate over who would eat the last one.  (Dad got it... he weeded our whole yard today.  It's the least I could do!) For pizzas we ordered the mushroom and the Sicily (how could we NOT with our Sicilian roots).  The Schreiner's sausage was great, but the most Sicilian thing in the room was my dad.  There's nothing all that "Sicilian" about the pizza overall, other than the fact that it's fantastic (as all things Sicilian are).  But to me, Sicilian flavors incorporate far more fresh produce and seafood.  Regardless of my opinions of the definition of Sicilian cuisine, bottom line: Sicily pizza = yum.  However, the mushroom pizza might have been the BEST mushroom pizza I've ever had.  The goat cheese was mildly sweet and super creamy which was a great contrast to the full earthy flavors of the mushrooms and truffle oil, and it came with a generous serving of fresh spinach on top.  I always look forward to coming back here.  It's inexpensive enough to always order our tried and true favorites, along with something new and exciting.

This place was recommended to us by some friends, so we decided to try it on a whim one night.  The decor was very modern and earthy.  Our server was very knowledgable about the items on the menu, and gave my husband the advice of trying to "half portions" of the asian dishes he was debating between.  Turns out the half portions are HUGE.  He took almost a whole one home.  The teriyaki was a little bit too salty for my taste, but I thought the curry dish was excellent.  I had the steak tacos adn I thought they were also very well done.  The men at the table next to us ordered some hot sauce to go along with theirs, and I think I'll do that next time too.  I'll definitely be coming back here, especially when my sister is in town because they have a variety of gluten free menu items.

(Just noticed that I never finished this one. Many many months later, here's the review...)  My very sweet husband knew I'd been wanting to try Tuck Shop for a while, so he surprised me with a Mother's Day brunch here.  First of all, I love the look of the place.  Kind of a contemporary log cabin.  They have a great little waiting area, very much like a cozy living room.  Their brunch set up was unique.  Not all served by a waiter, not all buffet; a little bit of both.  They had two entrees to choose from so my husband and I ordered both (duh).  The biscuits and sausage gravy was fantastic.  Creamy, peppery, and delicious.  The other entree was crab cakes.  The buffet had fresh fruits, grilled veggies, yogurt and toast.  Loved our mother's day experience here, and we're anxious to go back and try it for a date night sometime!

This place has GREAT food, GREAT happy hour, and a really nice staff.  And they serve breakfast pretty much ALL DAY.  Pretty awesome by my standards.  The Hangover sandwich is a heart attack between two slices of bread, but it's so worth it.  The sausage is great, and the way the eggs drip into the sandwich...mmm....  Most of their breakfast dishes come with a side of fresh fruit, which we love because we can share it with the kids.  Oh, and the best part, in my opinion- the breakfast nachos...  I thought my sister and I were the only people in the world who ate nachos for breakfast, but no... the people at Daily Dose do it too, and they do it even better than I do!  Unfortunately we moved from Scottsdale, but we'll be making the trek from Tempe to fill our bellies here!  It's a new fave!  My only complaint is that it can be a bit slow at times...

We ate here for the first time this morning.  The food was better than average, the portions were generous and the service was both fast and friendly.    After seeing that their sausage gravy is made from scratch every day, I had no option but to try it.  It didn't disappoint.  It was creamy and delicious but not overly greasy or heavy like sausage gravy can so easily be.  The omlette my husband and I shared was tasty and the veggies were fresh and plentiful.  Our daughter's pancakes were fluffy and perfectly cooked and very tasty.    Anytime we do a sleepover at grandma's in north Scottsdale, this is a sure bet for breakfast!

Between the three of us, we ordered quite a few things off the menu, with the intention of having leftovers: four tacos, guacamole, ceviche, a side of chorizo, chilaquiles, and the naco torta.  There were no leftovers to be had.  The star of the meal were the chilaquiles.  The green chile sauce that comes on top is simply delicious, with just the right amount of kick that complimented the rich yolk of the sunny side up eggs and the tender chicken and gooey cheese.  Our server was friendly and helpful.  While we were waiting for our food, I spilled my sangria.  Not only did he bring me a refill at no charge, he brought me a plate full of the booze-soaked fruit as well.  My toddler had a hard time understanding that she couldn't eat any of it, so we had to order an additional side of (booze-free) fruit for her.  Problem solved.  The total for our bill was just shy of $80.  For all that food, and four alcoholic beverages, we all felt it was a very reasonable price.    I enjoyed looking at all the artwork that adorned the walls, and my dad and husband got a kick out of the urinals shaped like lips in the men's room.  I'm a big fan of eating local, and they're not shy about letting people know which local vendors their foods come from.  They use a number of the same vendors that I buy from frequently: Schreiner's sausage, pork from the Meat shop, produce from Maya's Farm.  They just do a far better job of putting it all together :)  All in all, we had a fantastic experience and are looking forward to visiting again in the very near future.

For some reason, I always get stuck in a rut at most restaurants.  I find one menu item that's my favorite, and I rarely to never stray.  However, something about Gallo Blanco makes me bold, and I've ordered something different on many occasions... and now, I don't even think I have a favorite dish anymore.  I think I have about 7.  You really can't go wrong at this place.  It's fantastic.

First of all, the service was outstanding.  I called earlier in the day, when I was still trying to decide at which restaurant to eat, and the waiter/host on the phone was happy to describe to me, in detail, the appetizers and entrees that were on the board that evening.  I made our reservation then and there.    To me, an indicator of a great restaurant is a menu that isn't standardized.  While they do have a small menu of appetizers, entrees and desserts (I think 3 each) that are always available, the majority of what they serve each evening is written on chalkboards on both sides of the restaurant.  We decided to go with an appetizer and entree from the year round menu, and one each from the chalkboard.    Our starters were the butternut squash soup with green chilis (from the board) and the pear gorgonzola flatbread (from the menu).  The soup was phenomenal .  It was smooth, creamy and slightly sweet with the perfect amount of spice courtesy of the green chilis.  The seeds of the squash were roasted and added as a garnish.  Waste not, want not.  Plus they were delicious and a great crunchy contrast to the perfectly pureed squash.  The pear and gorgonzola flat bread was good too, but nothing spectacular.  When we go back I think I'd probably skip it and try something a little more unique.    After reading fellow yelpers reviews, I decided to go with the kobe meatloaf for my entree.  It didn't disappoint in any way.  The presentation was beautiful, with the meatloaf set atop a mound of chive and goat cheese mashed potatoes (I'll get to those in a minute) and topped off with a generous helping of crispy fried onions.  The meatloaf itself was juicy and had great flavor.  The potatoes were fantastic... a possible "last meal on earth" contender.  Potato + chives is always a big hit with me, and the addition of the goat cheese put it over the edge.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The goat cheese wasn't overwhelming but there wasjust enough to make it recognizable.  Avenue B adds to the dilemma my husband and I face every time we visit Pittsburgh: too many good places to eat, and not enough meals to fit them all in.  Needless to say, Avenue B has pushed itself to the top of the priority list.  I see an anniversary dinner here in our future...

There's nothing bad I can say about our experience at FnB.  The drinks, food, staff, atmosphere- all excellent.    I tried two of the cocktails from the menu- the Milano and the Spring Sundowner.  The Milano was a very flavorful drink that was somewhat bitter, but after a few sips my tastebuds became acquainted to the flavor and I happily guzzled the rest of it.  The Spring Sundowner, however, was DELICIOUS from the first sip to the last.  It was so light and refreshing and delicately sweet.  I'd go out of my way just to sit and sip one of these cocktails.  We had the leeks, mozzarella breadcrumbs and egg.  I'm glad we followed the crowd and tried this before leeks go out of season!  Every bite was delicious with a perfect balance of texture- the tender, smooth leeks with the gooey mozzarella and egg, plus a little bit of crunch from the breadcrumbs.  Our entrees were delicious as well.  I had lamb with artichokes, beans, asparagus and potatoes.  The flavors were incredible- very earthy and rich.  My husband had the jidori chicken with spaetzle.  We've both eaten a lot of chicken in our day, but NOTHING like this.  It was so perfectly moist and flavorful, and the skin had the perfect amount of seasoning and crunch to it.  I was almost jealous that I hadn't ordered it!  But then I had another bite of my lamb, and was content with myself...  We decided to skip dessert since we had friends waiting to meet us.  When our server brought us our check he politely told us "We don't take "no" when it comes to dessert," and gave us two pieces of homemade peanut brittle that was crunchy and delicious.  My husband and I don't get many childless meals out, so spoiling ourselves at FnB was a perfect way to spend a night without our girls.  We'll be back for another soon!

I've experienced better.  It's called Rula Bula.  It's right around the corner.  My distaste for this place began a week or so before I ever set foot in the establishment.  My husband and I were with our kids, walking around  Mill and walked past the restaurant, where they had an employee standing outside trying to rally some business.  We ended up having a short conversation with her in which she stated that we should come to Robbie Fox's, "the only authentic Irish pub in Tempe."  To this, we replied, "Haven't you ever heard of Rula Bula?"  "Yes," she told us, "this is better."  My husband and I have been faithful Rula Bula patrons for many years.  I couldn't imagine anyone in Tempe having better fish and chips than them...  ...but, for some reason my curiosity got the best of me and I stopped by Robbie Fox's for a late lunch one afternoon when my daughter and I were out walking around Mill.  I had a hankering for fish and chips and figured I'd give it a try, even though I knew it probably wouldn't compare to Rula Bula's.  I was right.  Not even in the same league.  Even the chips were inferior.  Their "chips" are more like shoe string french fries which I'm not a fan of because there's so little potato to them.  Their tartar sauce was pretty standard, again, inferior to Rula Bula's.    The service was good, and normally I like it when the waitress gives my daughter a little attention, and acknowledges her undeniable cuteness (okay, maybe I'm a little biased) but this waitress seriously wouldn't leave us alone.  Give me some space, I'm eating.  At the end of the meal, she brought my daughter a bowl of ice cream.  Although it was a very nice gesture, my daughter hadn't eaten more than two bites of her food, and I really hadn't planned on giving her any sort of sweets.  While free food is always appreciated, it's best to ask before you put a bowl of ice cream in front of a toddler.    I don't think I can betray Rula Bula again.

Really, I don't have much to compare it to other than the Civic Arena... er, Mellon Arena so I gave it four stars due to lack of comparison.  But it seemed so much BRIGHTER and more open than Mellon Arena, which I always thought was a little dreary...   But the seats in the upper deck are STEEP, so rather than the higher rows going BACK, they go UP.  Basically, even if you're in the top row, you aren't so far back that you get a bad view of the ice, and the tall guy in front of you doesn't obstruct your view.  My brother's seats (VERY top row, handicapped seating) are great.  I've become spoiled by sitting in his handicapped seats at sporting events though... they put you in a folding chair (nice cushioned ones too!) with lots of space and legroom if you're not in a wheelchair.  But, even though we were in the top row, and even though I was wearing my glasses instead of my contacts, I could see the puck perfectly the whole time... which was especially nice the 8 times it made it into Tampa Bay's net!  Take 10 steps backward from my brother's seats and you're right at a concession stand.  The barbecue place behind section 204 is pretty good.  I got the standard arena-food stomach ache after I had their BBQ chicken nachos, but they were good going down.  All my family members have come to agree that the food in the Consol Center is much better than at the Civic Arena.  Oh, and they have Tim Horton's coffee and donuts too.  I'm neither a coffee fan nor a fan of donuts, but my brother sure does love them.    Can't wait to come back!

Not a single complaint about this place!   We decided to bar hop a bit before heading to see Mason Jennings last night, and when we arrived at the Crescent Ballroom we were actually kinda pissed we didn't just hang out there before the show.  Here's what I liked about the place:  ~friendly staff ~nice outdoor patio ~reasonably priced drinks ~an audio feed into the restaurant/bar area... this was especially nice because we didn't have to miss anything to get drinks or go to the bathroom. ~plenty of seating and standing room to watch the show ~a second smaller stage outside the main stage (had a guy playing as the Mason Jennings show let out).  We didn't try any of the food but we're gonna try to get back here for another show as soon as we can!

HOORAY for an alternative to too-big bowls of ice cream and nasty non-fat frozen yogurt on Mill!    These frozen treats are delicious- you can tell they're freshly made and there's a great variety to choose from.  Eight year old loves the key lime pie (has a graham cracker crust on one side. yum); 2 1/2 year old loves the strawberry; my current favorite is the pineapple and raspberry, but I'm looking forward to moving onto some creamier, dairy-filled delights when I can start eating dairy again.  On that note, this place is great for people with food allergies- no wheat? no dairy? no problem- everything here is great!

This place is PRETENTIOUS. The crowd is mostly Scottsdale-douchey. The drinks are expensive. The rules are ridiculous.  But I'll be damned if the drinks aren't delicious. Also? The process of making the drinks is turned into an awesome show. And it's science! Fire! Smoke! Bubbling liquids! Who doesn't love science?!  Especially science that results in a delicious cocktail.  A few tips:   NOT for a big group. Don't try to go with any more than six. And if you have six, expect to wait a while because there are only two tables that accommodate a group that large. We had over 10 people in our group and it was made very clear to us that they do not want people up and moving around and mingling between tables. So don't try that.   But DO try the Smoked Bloody. It's the best Bloody Mary I've ever had in my life. I will go back JUST for that.  Overall, R + D is a great place to go with another couple to have a few drinks and some quiet conversation with a bit of entertainment.

In theory:  A fantastic idea.  Sampling cuisine from dozens of food trucks at a few bucks a sample, let the kids play, bounce, slide, zipline, etc., and have a beer, all while enjoying the sunshine and some pleasant background music.  I sampled some really delicious food (yay!) but only from 2 trucks (booo!).  My kid bounced and went down the slide, and the lines for both were short, and she really enjoyed them.  But she's 3 so she's the easy one to appease.  The kids activities were the only reason I gave a second star.    We grown-ups, however, thought this event was so poorly executed, and we were so, SO disappointed.  My primary complaints:    THE LINES.  OH the lines!  The whole idea is to try a variety and without splitting our group up completely (think:  "I'll wait here for hot dogs.  Here, take $4 and get me something from the Cajun truck.  Okay, you go and get some tacos.  And you can get some BBQ.") We hardly got to spend time with the group of friends we were with, and the time we did spend together we were working out the logistics of how to most efficiently deal with the lines.  LACK OF SEATING.   While each sample is only a few bites, it still would have been nice to find a place to sit down with the smorgasboard we ended up with.  Shade would be a plus.  PAYMENT SYSTEM. The independent payment/ticket system was a drag.  Some places took cash only, some places took cash or credit cards, some places required tickets...  There should just be one universal ticket that costs $1 or $2 and that would reduce confusion.    BRING MORE FOOD!  Lobster roll truck running out of lobster 2 hours in?  Yikes.  There were some really unhappy people that had to walk away from the line they'd been standing in for more than a half hour.   This event has SO much potential.  I hope they can get it figured out and try again.

I really, really wanted to like this place. It's in my neighborhood and it's a perfect happy hour spot for us.   We got a pizza for the kids. It had entirely too much oregano. That's all I could taste. We also got the buffalo shrimp appetizer- nothing remarkable there, either. And, being owned by the people from the Grind, I figured I should try a burger so I ordered the Texas BBQ burger. When I ordered and she didn't ask me how I wanted the burger cooked, I started to expect the worst.... and I wasn't far off. The burger was dry. The BBQ sauce was okay- it had a good spice to it. And I'm always a fan of an onion ring and coleslaw on a sandwich, so no complaints there. But it was all put on top of that dry, tasteless burger.   Apparently the kitchen at the Grind isn't sharing any tips with the kitchen at Mad G's.

Food was decent (tasty but salty pork, didn't like the chicken, great beans and fruit salad) Band was good Dancers were amazing, especially the fire dancer  We're already planning to book a dancer for an upcoming event. This is a nice, family run establishment and they make it easy and really enjoyable. I'd totally recommend them for a big party or corporate event.
