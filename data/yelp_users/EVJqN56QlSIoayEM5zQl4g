I have been going to Advanced for years and Dave has been great to work with. I like that he gives you the options to use factory parts or to use aftermarket based on your budget. Plus the work has already been completed on time and for what was quoted. I would highly recommend Advanced for any car repairs you need.

Tempe is full of pizza places and if you like NY style Venezia's is the best. For me the crust is a make it or break for pizza since toppings can be very similar restaurant to restaurant. It's full of flavor with just the right amount of sauce that is great. The crust is thin and crispy but not so much were if you fold the pizza it's going to break in half.  My personal favorite is the chicken pesto since it's overloaded with chicken.    While this is a pizza place their wings and calzones are also worth a try.

The food is standard Americanized Mexican but it is still very tasty. The chips were fresh and the salsa was flavorful but not hot. I had the enchiladas and my gf had the fish tacos, both of which were good.  All of the staff was very nice and helpful.  However the food took a long time to come out.

I had a tooth that cracked while eating a candy bar of all things.  I thought I was going to have to have my tooth removed which would have been terrible since it was towards the front of my mouth. I went to my regular dentist who told me I would need a root canal and a crown which was going to cost close to $1100 that I didn't have.    A friend recommended that I go see Dr. Matthews at Acacia which was some of the best advice I could have received and  Acacia was able to see me the next day after I called them.  Dr. Matthews said he thought he could do a filling and if that didn't work he go down the root canal option.  The filling was only $40 so I saved over $1000 and my tooth is still good a year later.   I would highly I recommend Dr. Matthews for a first or second opinion.

If you are a hipster and like PBR this place is for you. Bikini Lounge is the definition  a dive bar where you go there for the cheap drinks and not the atmosphere.   Also a fun place to hang out at after walking around First Friday.

A group of six of us came here for a birthday dinner.  We were promptly sat down soon as we walked in since the place was pretty empty.  We sat inside but they have an awesome patio with that has live music every other Saturday.  Chips and salsa are a staple at Mexican restaurants and can sent the tone of the meal.  The chips were tick and very hard with no salt on them.  The salsa was was blended and flavorful on a scale of 1-10 it was a 1 in terms of spice.  We asked for a hot salsa and the waiter brought out a green salsa that was thin as water with nothing but liquid however it was spicy.   It was kind of weird but the food all came out at different times and a couple of plates came out 10 mins after the first group. Once every thing was out we all agreed the food was very bland and was lacking seasoning.  For $20 roughly per plate the food was very average.   The drinks were good but you can get good drinks at a million restaurants that also have good food.

When you walk in and see the 80s decor don't let that sway your opinion. I've been here several times since Wong's is close to my house.  The service is always great plus the food is really good and consistent. I've had orange chicken, hunan, szechuan, chow mein all with shrimp, beef, or chicken. I would recommend the szechuan beef out of all the dishes I've tried so far. Although they have all been full of flavor with large portions and plenty of veggies not just a plain plate of meat.

I love Aloha usually late at night when I want something sweet. When you first walk in the staff always greets me and offers small cups for samples. Then it's like playing flavor roulette because the choices always change and they have always been super tasty.  My favorites have been maraschino cherry which tasted exactly like the cherries and cracker jack.  There are a ton of topping options, everything from nuts, candy, cookies, hot fudge.

My gf and I recently went there for a friends birthday.  We showed up a little late after most had already sat down.Drinks took close to 15min for a coke and margarita.  While waiting for drinks we tried some of the hottest salsa we've ever had. The salsa was so spicy was so spicy most of the table left it alone after a few bits.  When we were about to finaly able to order it took close to 40 minutes for our dishes to come out.  I had a chicken chimi and she had a chili relleno.  Both were  very plain and pretty boring.  Overall the food is a average and the service is terrible.  Los Dos Molinos in Ahwatukee is living on the name of the other locations.

This place is dangerous since it's right next to EOS gym.  Some days the amazing smells win out and I have to go in for a cinnamon raisin or cheese bagel. There is always several people in line and for good reasons, the Bagels are super fresh and really good.  If you really like cream cheese you'll be in heaven because you get a lot and I mean a lot. The selection of bagels is good and they offer tons of sandwich options too.

When I purchased a used Dell from Foxetech Alex was great to work with.  I give me several options and was able to find something that was able to work with my budget.  He as also been very helpful with repairs and upgrades.

The service is good but everything else is mediocre at best.  The sauce and meat had little to no flavor.  I had the brisket and the other person I was with had the pulled pork sandwich and neither of them stood out.

I went to TQLA with a group of friends after hiking so we were hungry and ready to eat.  We sat in the bar area and our server quickly came over with chips and salsa and took our drink order.  Their avocado salsa was amazing and I would go just to eat that and drink a few beers.    I had the carnitas burrito off their lunch menu my friends had the Fajitas and Baja Tacos .  The food was good and everyone enjoyed their lunch but the food is more tex mex then authentic Mexican.

Justin has cleaned the windows at our office several times.  He shows up on time, is friendly, very fair with his prices, and every time the windows look perfect..  I wouldn't hesitate to have 1st Glass Windows Cleaners clean our windows again.

Joe and his crew are super helpful and friendly. I took them a B&B exhaust to be installed on my C5 Vette.  During the install there were some issues with the fitment and Joe was able to work with B&B to get the situation resolved quickly.  They did a great job with the install and my car came back perfect just the way it went in.

After having a bad experience with my first Realtor I found Tam.  He is the opposite of most Realtors he answers his phone and replies quickly to emails.  When we first sat down he help me to prioritize my deal breakers, must haves, and kind of wants. Tam was great to work with and I would recommend him to anyone looking to buy or sell a home.

For a fast food mexican resturant this place is awesome.  Senor Taco is several steps above the always popular Filibertos in terms of flavor. A lot of this is from how great the fresh tortillas taste and the many salsa options. I really like their shrimp burrito since it's loaded with a lot of shrimp. Bean burritos, beef tacos, chicken enchiladas, you can't go wrong.

The pizza is awesome here and I eat a ton of pizza from many different restaurants. I had the thick crust and my gf had a regular crust build your own.  Both crust were crispy (expected with such a hot oven) and had tons of flavor.  We really liked all the topping options and the size of the pizza.  I though the pizza looked small but I was stuffed when we left.
