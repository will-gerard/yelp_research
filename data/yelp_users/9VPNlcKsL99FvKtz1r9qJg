Okay, so I've not been here for any other meal than brunch, because I am absolutely in love with the corn griddle pancakes with chicken.  My boyfriend always gets this too, so I've never tried anything else.  But it's awesome, matched with a mimosa, guaranteed the rest of your Sunday will be wonderful.

I've been here twice, with two totally different experiences.   One time it was for a happy hour, it was pretty chill, like 6pm on a Wednesday. There were 4 or 6 of us, it was relaxing and we were able to eat some yummy bruchetta and chat and drink some wine in a cute little stylish place.  Then I thought it would be fun to have my little birthday soire there. So I scheduled a party of 15-20 for a Thursday around 8pm. They reserved me the little area just to the right of the entrance. It happened to be really, really busy that night, but, they managed to keep drinks in everyones hands. So although a little chaotic, it was a fun night.  Warning: good luck parking.

The staff here are very nice. Lauren is our stylist. She just cut our hairs tonight ;)   I always have a nice experience here, and always get to have margaritas either before or after at Loco Patron (next door), so I double look forward to my appointments!

Kathy was amazing. She did a wonderful job with my wedding dress. She took it up a few inches, made the bustling for the back and also took off a whole bunch of beads and crystals that would have thrashed the inside of my biceps if she had not noticed and know it might do that.  She is experienced, reasonably priced and super nice. She's also a very busy lady, so it's not recommended to call last minute.

Now this is good pizza! My fiancé's dad and wife discovered this little place in the foothills. We walked in and everyone knew them, and I swear everyone who walked through the door after us knew them too.   We had a spinach salad, which was sooo yummy, fresh mozzarella, really good dressing and pieces of bacon, yea bacon! Then we had some pizza, and I've been craving more since.   There is a pizza I want to try next time we go, it was like chicken and raspberry chipotle. Sounds interesting, I bet it's awesome.

I was staaarving today at lunchtime so when my husband suggested the Indian buffet, I was so down! Everything was really good, I haven't had vegetable pakoras in years, so yummy. The only thing I'd say was lacking is the decor. The first room you walk into is fine, but then there is another huge room, that's half empty. It's kinda weird.   I'm happy to hear that they are going to start offering a dinner buffet starting in September. The waiter also said that the dinner buffet will offer more variety that lunch, including some seafood. YAY.

Two words: Chambord Margarita  I used to not even like margarita's, Z Tejas changed my outlook on tequila.    The food is great too.  My usual favorites are the shrimp & guac tostada bites to start then move on to the artichoke chicken stack for dinner, and cornbread of course.  I've also tried the smoked chicken enchiladas and loved em.  Sunday morning brunch I have to have my egg hash...and a margarita :)

OMG OMG OMG, the happy hour hamburger is so delicious (I think it's the bacon that does it).   I've only been here twice, and both times for happy hour. They have an excellent happy hour for the quality of food they serve. I've tried, obviously the burger and also the crab cakes, both which were yummy. The drink specials are great too, they make a great margarita and have an ample wine list. I'll be back!

I am so happy I found a place like this on the east side. It kinda reminds me of LGO but more accessible and spacious, I have found parking close by every time. I'm a sucker for downtown areas and rebuilt old buildings that are also well designed (the bathrooms are a must-see) and I love all the natural lighting from the big windows. It's been a little too chilly to sit on the patio, but it's tucked away from the road a bit, so I bet you'll find me there come springtime.   I keep coming back for the latte bowl. It's fantastic and stays hot for like an hour. We had a pizza last week which was really good, but yesterday ordered the breakfast quesadilla and although it was humongous (enough for two), it was kinda greasy on the inside. Everything else I have had has been really good though.   I am totally looking forward to the Espresso 101 and 102 classes I keep hearing about. I also want to try their other restaurant "Joes BBQ" across the street. I've heard good things about that place too.

It's true, it's a little hard to find, but that usually means better, right?  In this case, yes.    I love this place!  Fresh fish and friendly faces.  The chefs are fun and lighthearted and the owners are so sweet, you get a big warm welcome when you walk in the door. Totally a laid-back casual, friendly environment.  Easy to order with pictures and descriptions of all the sushi on the menu, complimentary green tea, oh and try the raspberry wine, soooo yummy.    They have some dinner entrees and apps for those who dont do sushi, but I wouldn't go there for the dinners it's all about the sushi.   Defiantly not a chain, it's where the locals around here go.

This is where I go too.  It's pretty nice compared to LA fitness, where I was before.  I've gone through a couple instructors in the cycle classes and they all kick my butt.  They have a good selection of classes, but I wish they had more times, they do get kinda crowded.  The tiny yoga studio was poorly thought out.  I really really really wish there was a pool.

The food is usually good  and most of the staff are friendly.  Had a bad experience with a counter person there once, she was very rude, if you hate your job, you should quit.  But other than that the low-fat raspberry muffins are my fav.    **Update:  Went there today and had their new summer salad.  Might as well have gone to mcdonalds for a salad, not great.  Service was better this time.

After leaving ZOE's for lunch, we spotted Easley's and couldn't resist. We brought presents back to the office for everyone.  What did we find there for our co-workers?  We brought back Liz some bacon band-aids. For Lenee, a poop pen. The other Russ got a pickle launcher.  They also have a ton of stuff for Halloween, probably thousands of costumes.   Check it out.

If I could go here everyday, I would and I would also be 500 pounds. It is soooo delicious. The salsa is good, the chips are better, the taco dish (I think it was called "Six Halves") was pretty freeking yumm and the side salad that came with it, wow.   The prices were reasonable. They have beer,wine and margaritas. The only thing I'd suggest is faster mamacitas (the service was slow).

I was a little weary about coming here, because for some reason in my head I was thinking it was a Baja Fresh/Rubios type place, boy was I wrong.  Most importantly, I think they made me the freshest squeezed margarita I've ever had. I also ordered some food, the delicious Adobo Pulled Pork sandwich, and guess what, it came with fries AND onion rings! I hate having to choose.   Other than our entire experience being positive, the only thing I'd say could use some help is maybe the decor. Kinda bland, the bar is the best part, we didn't hang out inside much since we sat on the patio, so maybe some more plants on the patio to block the view of the parking lot.

I've been to El Zocalo quite a few times and the only downsides are the prices are a little steep and the sangria is very disappointing (bottled).  But the patio is famous for being awesome, the margaritas are delicious, I think their speciatly (I like the pama marg).    You've got to try the shrimp appetizer with the chipotle sauce, get a whole order or you'll be sorry you didn't.  The soup that's on the menu is really good, I forget what it's called but it's perfect for lunch especially if you don't want to take a nap on your desk afterward.  It's got potatoes and chicken, maybe some cilantro, it's yummy and light.  Also, Friday and Saturday nights they have live music and I believe they are open pretty late, midnight or one maybe?

I've been looking for this place and didn't even know it. Drove by on the way to the Yelp party at Cafe Carumba and saw they had lots of bolts of fabric. I assumed it would be overly expensive being basically on the corner of Indian School and Scottsdale, but when I was in the neighborhood the other day I stopped in and was pretty happy with what I saw. They had tons of cute, modern home decor fabrics at pretty decent prices, especially for Scottsdale.   The only thing that was annoying is that even though they have rows and rows of bolts you still have to order many of the fabrics (which will take 1-2 weeks to recieve), even if it's just for a yard.

Last time I was at Furio was for a chick dinner and it happened to be Monday Manicure night, which was pretty fun.   I've been here a few times, once for a bachelorette party, once for happy hour and once for MM night. All three times I had a good time and didn't walk out with an empty wallet (rare for old town).  The interior is pretty cool and stylish, not too obnoxious and not a dive. Cute little patio. The only pain is parking.

I love Thai.  This is one of the best in Phoenix.    Went there for lunch one day and sat in the little paito area, it's small, but hidden and I kinda liked it.    Another time we went there for dinner and my (jackass) boyfriend who loves spicy food ordered it as spicy as it comes and couldn't eat it at all.  So be-careful what you ask for.

Grrrr, slightly irritated with Toni and Guys incompetence in scheduling. I said noon, they heard nine. So, I drove to Scottsdale and was told I missed my appointment, no apology or anything, just a blank stare. This is why most salons call the day before, to confirm that some ditz didn't write down the wrong time. Not only did they waste an hour of my day, but now I have to wear a hat for the next week.  Two stars because it is inexpensive and if you request my girl Sara G as your stylist, you will be very happy with the results.

Can I live here please? I've loved FLW since I was in like 5th grade or something and went on a school field trip and thought that wherever we were (some FLW building in Phoenix, I rack my brain trying to remember) was the coolest thing I'd ever seen.    I've been to Taliesin West quite a few times, kinda want to go again.  I think I want to live there.

I've walked by this place sooo many times and have never been interested in going inside, since I'm not a stripper, but tonight I'm going to a themed bachelorette party and I needed a wig.   So I was having a few drinks with Sunny after work and was going to drag her to AZ Fun Services on Broadway to help me find a wig, when she suggested Fascinations. I was reluctant, because according to her review Fascinations was waaay overpriced and wigs at the Fun store were like fifteen bucks. But we went anyway, and well, I was wrong, their wigs were around fifteen bucks and they had 50% off all Halloween stuff too. AWESOME! The sales guy was really cool, Suzuki or something. I thought the prices there for other day-to-day sex stuff was pretty reasonable too. I got a few extra things. I'll be back.

What is with the guy working there? He is seriously pissed-off every-time I go in. Actually last time I was there I walked out because he was yelling at one of the workers and it made me want to cry. I wish she would have walked out too. The time before that he was rude, not just rude, but a complete jerk to the people in front of me, what an a-hole.   2 stars because it is downstairs from my work, and it's cheap and if one of my co-workers goes to get a slice they always have my hawaiian pie.

If someone wants to have another work lunch here I'm going to shoot myself. There are so many better places around Mill.   The service is hit or miss. There was one time I met a friend there and ordered some stuff off the lunch menu, but apparently he thought we were ordering from the regular menu, even though it was lunch. When he brought the bill he argued with us about how we didn't say we wanted the lunch portion. Like we were trying scam them or something, sorry dude, the food was not worth that kind of effort.  The pizza is fine. Stay away from the spicy margarita, that was really gross.

Soo expensive when it's not happy hour. But when it is, bring it!   I love the wine list and martini choices. Went there a couple Sunday's ago and had some amazing raviolis.  Went there the other day and had a really refreshing pama-mojito drink.

I used to do this kind of yoga weekly when I lived in Flagstaff, and the best part was at the end of the 90 minute, 110 degree class is you got to go outside in the cool air afterward. Not in Phoenix, no sir, you get done with the class and go outside where it's nice and hot and then get in your even hotter car. Damn.   But this is just me complaining about the unbearable heat, again. The class was awesome. The instructor was friendly and thorough and pretty much remembered everyones names.   Be sure if you go to bring a yoga mat, 2 towels, one small one to wipe the dripping sweat off your brow and one to set over your mat so you don't slip on your sweaty mat. Water, it's hot in there. I recommend putting ice in your water too, a little treat.   They also had an August first-timer special for a two week unlimited pass it's $25, which is great. I got sick for a week, so only went to two classes. Sucks because after these two weeks, I don't think I'll be able to afford to go anymore, we'll see. It's like $375 for a three month pass and $16 to drop-in, a little pricey for me. That must not be the case for everyone else though, the classes I went to were pretty crowded.

Haha, that other review is kinda funny.  I went into the Dressbarn once(I had to see if everyone in there was like 500 pounds, I was dissapointed, there was nobody in there) and was out within like a minute. I guess anything with the name barn and a clothing item can be expected to not be very stylish.

Like I've said before, I'm not gay, except that one time, or, maybe there was more than that one time, but I'm defiantly not a gay man and I still love this spot.    I love the bartender, forget his name, know him if I saw him, but he recommends the best drinks when I come in always indecisive.

Yay for FEZ, I need to visit again.  I used to go there all the time, brunch, lunch, dinner and um, happy hour :)  Love love love sitting on the patio.  Since I moved to the east valley I haven't frequented as much, but it's always a treat when I do.    My favorites are the apricot chardonnay fusion.  I always have to have that, actually I usually go with a friend and we split a carafe (or two).  Their hummus I think is the best hummus I've ever had and I never thought I liked sweet potatoes, till I had FEZ's sweet potato fries.  Everything is pretty reasonably priced too, which is always a plus.

Daahhling, I'll have a gin and tonic. If you don't feel fabulous here, then you don't have any imagination.   I love the decor, it's fun to hang out here and have drinks at night. I've also had breakfast here before too, it was pretty good and certainly a different feel from the saucy evening there before, but it still had the same effect on me, that I was ab-fab.   Hanging out by the pool is fun too, smaller than I thought it would be though. (that's what she said)

Aww, too bad these guys went out of business.  I actually only went there one time, I live in Chandler, so it's just a little out of the way.  But I stopped through the drive-thru and thought if I lived near-by this would be my coffee place.  Whoever took my order that day was very friendly.

Hey! Just went to Padres last night for a margarita. Went with a couple of friends, they ordered some apps, that I of course stole some bites of, and it was pretty yummy. I had a raspberry margarita, which was made just right, and I also had a sip of my friends sangria, which was okay.   Last time I visited Padres, Cascabel was playing (they also played at my wedding) and they were so much fun and everyone was dancing and having a great time.  It's a cute little restaurant, with a cute little bar.

Hubby and I were invited to join a friend for a seafood grilling class and wine tasting, what better way to spend an early Saturday afternoon?   It was an intimate setting, three or four tables of people, everyone was friendly and interested in learning some new techniques. The chef was knowledgeable and made some excellent grilled fish and veggies. The waiter was also well-educated when he spoke about the wines.   I hope they have another class soon on how to grill the best steak!

Okaaay, so my fiance really wanted to go here for dinner last night, but I was weary, sounded really greasy. So I talked him into something else, then  again today, pleeeease, Chino Tori? Fine, I gave in.   I'll give this to Chino, it's an original idea. Mexican, Jamaican and Chinese fusion, but it's not executed well at all. Like someone said before, the whole ordering process, especially for first timers needs to somehow be streamlined, it's ridiculous, like they need a help desk or something. But part of the initiation is you get to taste test before ordering, so I guess that is good.  The location is waaaay back in this weird building, and weird weird, not weird good. There is also way too much space inside, gives it a very cafeteria feel.   Now to the food...the jerk chicken Chris ordered was pretty good, as was his sweet n sour chicken and rice. My lunch on the other hand was a disaster, so I ate half of his. I ordered the emerald chicken, then I get the choice of being served over rice or in a quesidilla, I chose the dilla. Well, that was the wrong choice. See the pic I posted, my quesidilla was glistening!! We could not eat it. It was in a pool of grease. Gross.  So Chino, I have some ideas for ya. Get it together, this is a cool concept, but learn how to make your food consistently good, maybe toasting the quesidillas instead of frying? Hire a professional to look at your menu and give suggestions for prep. Second, the ordering system needs attention, it's confusing. Thirdly, the space is weird and desolate, some interior changes would be a good thing.

I can go in this store anytime and occupy myself for at least an hour. They have a huge selection of papers, paper accesories and tools. But I am a graphic designer with a love for paper.  I would have liked to give five stars, but I went to one of the classes they offer and it was way too simplistic, not very long and we didn't make anything fun/cool to bring home. Maybe I should try one of the more advanced classes, but they are kinda expensive.   Bummer about them being robbed.

These are the types of bookstores I like, independently owned.  Unfortunatly I've been there 2 times where they didn't have what I was looking for.  But if I'm going in there with nothing in mind, I leave with tons of stuff.  It's also great for gifts when you don't know what to get someone, they have lots of crafty local artist stuff for sale.

Why did I kinda have fun here the other night, when typically I hate scottsdale clubs? Cause I didn't expect much and I was with a bunch of fun girls for a bachelorette party.    When we first arrived a manager came out and tried to sell us VIP seating that came with a $400 bottle, ya right. Who falls for this crap? The VIP area was not really that special and the $400 bottle of vodka for 15 girls probably would last like 5 seconds. Please.   I did actually like the decor though, but the crowd is what will keep me from coming back.   Oh ya, there is a burlesque dancer who comes out once an hour, pretty cool, although I could see that novelty wearing off fairly quickly.

Jalepeno margarita. Hibuscus margarita. Strawberry margarita.  Just a few of their homemade flavored margaritas.    I've only been here for happy hour, but the prices were good and the margaritas were great, we got some taquitos which were really good too, the sauce was to die for.   I Can't wait to hang out on the patio.   Only one thing, wish they were open on Sundays.

I'm voting this the best customer service I've had in a long time!   We stopped into this Valle Luna on our way home, I've never been to this location, but now I think I've completed the circle.  The bartender was very polite and attentive and the waiter was also very sweet and helpful.  They must treat their employees well, cause they are certainly not disgruntled.    My boyfriend and I love Valle Luna, not sure if its because we both grew up on the restaurant or what, but they always satisfy.  All of the locations are kinda dark inside (good if you have a hangover). Mostly booths.  We like to sit in the bar area.  The margaritas hit the spot and are around $5-8, they usually have specials, and usually use good tequila. The margarita's I had today were especially delicious,  (maybe cause it was the first 100 degree day?) I had a raspberry marg and a white death marg.

A more refined, mature, smaller, Casey Moores. What? That's not at all saying it's bad, I have an ongoing affair with Casey's and I would probably have a torrid love affair with The Lost Leaf if it weren't for the distance between us. We've flirted, and maybe when the train opens, we'll see where it takes me.

If I moved away from Phoenix and came back to visit, I would definitely stay at The Ho.   We stayed here on our wedding night and everything was fabulous. Some of our out-of-town guests also stayed here. We partied in the bar that night, had breakfast in the cafe the next morning, actually I had like five breakfasts that morning, trying to visit with all my guests before they left, every server I experienced was friendly and accommodating. I had the southwest eggs benedict and it was delicious.  We stayed two nights, so I spent both days by the pool, and I AM nice and tan now, thank you for asking. The Ho is within walking distance from Old Town where there are plenty of restaurants to choose from. We were able to come back from dinner and score the jacuzzi all to ourselves.  The grounds are beautifully decorated with flowers and contemporary couches and fountains about. The rooms are modern and funky and stocked with a nice brand of bathroom amenities. The only thing I had a problem with is the room we got faced outward and overlooked a dirt lot, felt like we were in a demilitarized zone when we sat on the balcony, but it did have a lovely lounge chair on it.  Overall we had a fantastic stay, maybe we will be back for our anniversary!

I've been waiting for the light rail since it was first brought up back in like '94 or something, and now it's finally here!  I really love using the light rail, but I do wish it came out toward my house, I'd be on it all the time! It's still pretty clean, and the other people that ride can sometimes be entertaining. Although, there was an incident when it first opened, and was standing room only, that some chick dropped her 44oz thirstbuster all over the place, including my new boots, seriously lady? omg.   I'll give five stars as soon as it's expanded more across the valley.

Neither my boyfriend or I have ever used SS, but since our flight was so early in the morning, we didn't want to ask anyone for a ride, so I scheduled a SS.  GOOD IDEA?  Our flight was scheduled for 7:20 or something around that.  The earliest time they pick up is 5am, which seemed ok at the time of scheduling.  They of course fail to mention that after picking us up, we'd also be picking up two more slack-ass parties who's flights aren't till 9am and won't be in any hurry to get in the van.   So, they showed up on time, that was a plus, but I'd say everything pretty much went downhill from there.  We went to the next stop in the mega-apartment center near the Chandler Mall which isn't too far from our house.  Couldn't find the guy who was being picked up so drove around for about 10 minutes, finally found him and still had to wait for him to get his shit together.  Then we went to pick up the most annoying family on the planet.  We get to their gated community down the street from the last pick-up and they don't know the code, so they have to drive from their house to meet us at the gate to swipe their wand thingy, ok. whatever. then we follow them to their house where they are still packing.  After ten more minutes everyone is in the van and we are off.  We get on the freeway and are on our way to the airport...untill, the man of the annoying family we just picked up announces he's forgotten his "heart medication" (after thinking about this for a while, we think he made that shit up and actually forgot his socks or some bullshit).  Soooo, we TURNAROUND to go back to his gated community where they don't know the code to get in, so they send their innocent (but portly) 13 year-old daughter over the fence to run back to the house. At that point the driver shoulda been like, "dude, we'll call you another shuttle to pick you up, I gatta get these people to the airport so they don't miss their flight" but no, we waited what seems like half an hour for this girl to run to and from their house and back over the fence to actually take off for the airport again. We are off again and the family is chuckling about what an idiot dad is and of couse we are fuming, but don't want to get into a fight, just want to get to the god damned airport on-time.  So yeah, we get to the airport at 6:55 for our 7:20 flight.  Barely, BARELY make it, and wanted to kill someone. BAD BAD BAD idea.

We took the train from Mill to downtown Monday night, and heard that Switch does half-priced sangria, sooo, had to check that out. Pretty cute place.  The sangria was indeed special, and on special. We also got the hummus plate, which was really good, and I wish it came with more roasted red peppers, they were addicting! Yum.   A couple little weird things though, the host stand is at the back, or middle if you consider the patio, which I guess makes sense for them, but was kinda confusing for a first timer and there was nobody manning the stand there which didn't help. We also had a total of three servers, maybe we should consider that special treatment :)   But I'll be back, gotta try the brunch still!

This is a new fav happy hour place for us, we've already been here twice this week. It's pretty close to our house, great happy hour and great service, both times we've been there, our servers were really cool. Oh, and the food is pretty good too, especially for being so inexpensive.   Can't beat $2.50 margaritas, they aren't the biggest margaritas, but...$2.50, I'm not going to complain. I had a steak taco last night, it was pretty dang good, and they have a salsa bar. My fiance loved his burrito.  There is also a nice little patio.

Yummy.    Ropponngi Fizz - My new favorite drink.    The food was very good, and I actually had to ask the waiter what some of the ingredients were, which makes it more adventurous.  I had the lamb chops which were served with a mango-chutny, make sure to try it on the lamb, yum.  My boyfriend had the fish and chips and that was also very good, the batter was light and fluffy and served with seaweed chips.    We sat on the patio, perfect night outside, the waiter was very nice.  We ended with the to-die-for warm chocolate cake with syrup.  I never eat chocolate, so when I do, I want it to be amazing, and this was!

Ate here just yesterday. Their sandwiches are really good and slightly different. They don't slather the bread with butter and toast them, at least not the ones I've had (which might be good or bad depending on what you're looking for).  The last few times I've had smoked turkey and gouda with a dijon-honey mustard on a sun-dried tomato bread, pretty delicious. They also have a smoked salmon sandwich and I also tried a chicken curry soup that was really freeking good. They have a selection of different pasta and fruit salads and also usually have about four different kinds of unsweetened teas to choose from, like mango, pineapple, spiced black and regular.  Their service is friendly.    The decor lacks, but I usually get it to go anyway, so it doesn't bother me.

Ok, I don't know if they have an actual physical store or where you get these nuggets of goodness, but I got one from a co-worker for Christmas last year and damn that was tasty.    I cut it into four sections, one everyday for 4 days so I could savor it.

How did he know? I guess we looked liked tired shoppers who needed a few margaritas, and they were damn good margaritas at that. The bartender was attentive, and so was the wait staff (chips and salsa as soon as we hit the seats). We had a couple margs and shared the brisket tacos, which were pretty deelish. The salsas are also nice.   Only four stars cause, the decor is lacking any interest and it's a corporate franchise, it's hard for me to give five stars to a place that's a little too expensive and lacks soul.

Psst, hey Loco Patron, can you open a Loco by my house pleeeease. Like Queen Creek and Price. We'll be your first regulars!  My boyfriend and I go to K-Bella salon to get our hairs cut and while we wait for one another, we hang out at Loco which is in the same strip mall. The staff is really cool and they have great HH prices and pretty decent food. They also have lots of different tequilas to choose from.

I really like La Bocca.  I want them to be my go-to for happy hour, because the decor is just my taste, they are always friendly and the food is good.   But when I do go to happy hour, sadly none of the drinks I prefer are ever on happy hour and no happy hour apps. Which is sad cause their buchetta is really good and so are the pizzas, I think I've tried most of the flavors.

We shopped around for living room furniture for months before a friend told me about Eurway. Everywhere I went I only found ugly-ass, boring sofas and uninspired living room sets, until that is, until Eurway. We furnished our living room with a sleek and modern set (which the animals are not allowed to go near) and am happy to say that we paid that off last month (0% interest financing) and went back for more this weekend. A new bedroom set will be delivered beginning of October, yay. Did I mention they also had a 20% off sale. Yay.

I was out in QC visiting with some family yesterday and we stopped into the QCOM. One of my mother-in-laws has been raving about this place forever, so we decided to make a lunch date of it.   We started by checking out the cute little store. They have a bunch of different olive oils to choose from, some of my favorites are the Chili, Lime and Blood Orange. They also have tasters of their yummy tapenades, fresh baked bread, a decent wine selection and bath products made from their olive oil.   We then moved on to lunch, which is bistro style. Everything looked so good! I ended up getting the special lunch sandwich of the day, which was ham, cheese, marinated sweet red bell peppers, sauteed onions on fresh focaccia bread. The bread is to die for, and everything else  only enhanced the greatness of this sandwich! It might be the most delicious sandwich I've ever had. If it wasn't so dang hot out, I would have loved to sit on their cute little patio.   After eating and then wandering a little longer inside, we were leaving and spotted a little garden. We went over there, they had all kinds of flowers, shrubs and herbs for sale. The woman working in the garden area was very helpful and knowledgeable. I ended up buying a little basil plant (came in a cute little ceramic pot) for 5 bucks.   On our way out we stopped at the table where a guy was sampling their raspberry champagne and prosecco. Both were very good, I like bubbles :) They also have an almond champagne, which I am excited to try next time. This would be a fun place to go on a Saturday afternoon, get a bottle of wine and nosh!

What the heck! We tried going here for lunch today, they were closed. Their hours posted said that they should have been open at 11, but no, kinda sucks cause we were excited to do something different.  Maybe we'll try again soon.

The menu is very impressive, and they change it monthly   I.LOVE.THAT.    We wanted to try Cork out a while ago, but showed up for lunch and they were closed. We are so glad that we weren't disappointed enough to blow this place off.   The Staff: awesome. The Decor: love it.  The Live Flamenco Guitarist: fantastic.   ...and now the menu. We weren't even hungry going here, we had already had T-day leftovers for dinner, just wanted a few drinks, but after checking out the menu and hearing the special, we had to try something. They do small plates, which was perfect. Here is a short list of what I remember from the menu:  Antelope Ostrich Oxtail Foie Gras  Boar, this is what we tried and only pleasant things come to mind when thinking back about the dish, and it was served with an amazing beet risotto. Oh and they altered the dish for us because we wanted a side from another dish. We didn't ask, the bartender heard us talking about it, and customized it for us.   We will defiantly be back, a lot, like Sunday for brunch.  There are some vegetarian options also.

I liked this place, thought it was very cute. The interior was contemporary and bright. They have a patio, but it was full. Sunny thought the french toast was too small, but it was really rich, so if it wasn't being shared by three people it would have been plenty. It was really delicious, btw.   The bartender (owner?) greeted us when we walked in and was happy to start making our mimosas while we waited for a table to be cleared, so when we sat down, our mimosas were right behind, now that's service. We found out they had homemade sangria, it was also delicious.  I liked the food, I liked the atmosphere, I liked the bartender. They are right on the train route, so I'll probably go there again sometime when I'm in the area.

This is right on my way to work. Like Amanda, I drove by many times before stopping. I didn't realize it was a chain until after I had my first cup and went to their website when I got to work. But too late, I was hooked. The guys and gals that work their are way nice and the soy in the latte is really good, I have to find out which kind they use.    Oh ya and they are superfast, they have given me my  debit card back, stamped my punch card and gave me my coffee in less than a minute, I swear.   I am a little concerned to go back now that school has started, since they are directly across the street from ASU and I have been spoiled not having to ever wait very long.

I wanted to report that I have since returned (I do have a stamp card that I'm working on). I avoided that whole area the 1st week of school, but went there the other morning and not only had speedy, friendly service, but waited behind only one person. That's even less than when I had gone before school started. Oh and I don't know if they had anything to do with this, but I hit green lights all the rest of the way to work. Thanks Dutch Bros!

Splendid evening at Babaloos. Firstly, I'd like to thank Babaloos for the invitation, we had a really nice time. We've actually driven by a few times and were intrigued, but hadn't stopped in, that was a mistake! It's a very cute place, nice decor, the family seemed very nice, and well, let's get to the food, because it was absolutely scrumptious.   We arrived at 7:30ish, sat at a table and were immediately welcomed with a couple refreshing mojitos. A few minutes later Croquetas de Jamon were passed around by the servers. Trying to hide as mozzarella sticks this appetizer was much more delicate, filled with ham and a bechamel and served with a Mornay sauce. All of the tastings were paired with wine, and in this case it was a very nice chardonnay.  The second tasting was Amuse Bouche, a pineapple civiche, nice and crisp, paired with a pino grigio, which was perfect.  My favorite dish of the evening (other than the dessert, which, do not fear, I will get to) was the Camarones en Salsa Verde. Sauteed shrimp with salsa verde, which was light and fresh and wonderful, but my favorite part of the dish was the roasted tomato with tropical pesto, it was so flavorful! That was paired with a red, Montecillo Crianza, which I thought was strange, since the dish was so light, but surprisingly it worked really well together.  Next was the Ropa Vieja, flank steak slow cooked for hours in red wine, tomatoes, garlic, peppers and onions served with black beans and rice. This was exactly what I wanted after the lighter dishes, substantial, well cooked and comforting.  Drumroll please, the finally...TRES LECHES, dessert was amazing, I'm not exaggerating at all. My husband described it like a delicate cake served on rice pudding, but I think it was more like eating a sweet cloud at sunrise. We were pretty stuffed when the dessert arrived, but after one bite, it was impossible to stop. Seriously, must try. It was paired with an awesome aged rum, which I'm not usually a big rum drinker, but totally appreciated this one.   I'm writing this review, the day after, and am already craving to go back.

Sorry Mark, I have to mostly disagree with you on this one.   I do agree that they have great dogs, so maybe that's why they don't actually want to adopt them and I hate to be down on an organization who is trying to do a good thing, but...  A couple a weeks ago, a friend who volunteers for the rescue had taken one of the dogs out of the kennel he is staying in and brought him to the Fat Tire Festival at Tempe Town Lake. I fell in love with the little guy, his name is Jalen, and called my fiance to see if he'd come meet him too. He did, he loved him, so we decided to see if we could adopt him.   After filling out the online application (the only way to put in an application), which took over an hour, we waited the three business days they gave as the time frame that it could take to get back to us. Three days passed, nothing, so I called and emailed them to see if they even received the application, no response. So I asked my friend to find out next time he went to volunteer, if they had gotten it.  They told him that the website must be broken, because they did not receive it, so I asked him to see if they got the email or voicemail. NO? Okaaaay, what the hell?   Well, my volunteer friend brought over Jalen to our house to meet our other dogs and cat, to see if he would even fit in here. They all got along just fine. Seriously, they all got along, even with the cat.  Robert calls me later when he gets back to the rescue, and says, they found my application, but they still didn't call me back. So, we emailed them and called AGAIN. Finally, one and a half weeks after we filled out the online application,  a woman calls me with a list of excuses of why Jalen would not be a good fit. She told me that the cat is a concern, that the dog is terrified of cats (even though it says on his description on their website "We haven't found anyone Jalen doesn't get along with - cats, dogs, humans - he's just so mild-mannered."), I told her he met my cat and they were indifferent to each-other, there were other excuses she had, it was like she was reading them off a list. Finally after being on the phone with her for a half an hour, and it was obvious she didn't want to actually adopt the dog to anyone, I told her I had to get back to work. She then calls back ten minutes later saying that if we were okay with potty-training Jalen (apparently all of the other excuses she gave me were going to be disregarded now), that a volunteer could come over on Saturday morning to asses the situation. We said absolutely, see you then!   A senior volunteer (with the adopting powers)came over this morning, everyone got along great. Our pets are very loved and cared for. But she had a problem with us keeping our dogs outside, when it's nice out, like today, when we leave the house. We don't think they should be crated up when it's so nice out, our dogs like to be outside in our big backyard able to run around and lay in the grass/sun, not in a little crate inside. So she told us to keep the dogs inside when we leave the house for 30 days and see how that goes, and then call them back and they would come back over to reassess and she took Jalen back to the kennel where he has been staying, waiting for a good home.   Needless to say we were pretty disappointed that they didn't adopt to us, and completely disenchanted with the organization. We've adopted through a rescue before and didn't have any problems, I'd try valleydogs.org or www.akitaadvocates.com of you're looking for another rescue.

D'Lisa is a character, like I said in a thread before, she'll rip your hair out and entertain at the same time, I guess it's a good tactic for taking the pain away!  The salon is more than just hair removal, that's just her specialty.   It's a really cute place in Old Town and there are also hair stylists and I believe a masseuse.  Local artists also display artwork too.

Fruity Pebbles! YAY!  They don't have a sign up yet, but we were walking by and noticed they were open and there were happy people inside so they must be, oh yes it was true, giving away free frozen yogurt!   They were offering original (vanilla) and pomegranate flavors to choose from, I chose pomegranate. They have fruity pebbles as a topping which made me very happy, since that was my favorite cereal as a kid.

OK, this was their pre-opening run and we did get free lunch, buuut, I've definitely had better seafood and the the interior and exterior decorating is so boring, I thought I was in Sun City.   I chose the Talapia, which I normally don't care for, but I figured since I was at an expensive seafood joint in N. Scottsdale, they would change my mind. Nope, ew, gross and our waitress, was a bimbo.  Pretty disappointed, thank god we didn't pay the $179 they would have charged us for lunch. That's with iced tea, no lunch martinis available that day.

We really couldn't  have asked for better service, sangria or food.   After shopping for a few hours Sunny and I needed a recess. We were thinking of going to Abuelo's at the Chandler Mall when I remembered that my fiance and I had visited Nouveau Bistro (which was previously a Pasta Pomodoro) for drinks a few weeks ago and I really wanted to go back to try their food.   We were warmly welcomed and they had delicious sangria waiting for us. We tried a couple appetizers, the goat cheese with shrimp and the asparagus, both were mouth watering. The decor is modern and nice, they have a pretty cool patio, which I can't wait to sit and sip on some happy hour cocktails this spring.  Nouveau Bistro is gem in the mass of corporate restaurants of the Chandler Mall area, support our local restaurants!

Wow, this dinner was pretty spectacular. I've never had an experience quite like it.   So, you start with a lovely salad bar, they had butter lettuce (yessss) and a delicious basil dressing that went great with my tomato slices. There were also a variety of cheeses available and smoked salmon, yum!  Now lets get down to the meat. There was a Picanha (the prime part of the sirloin) which was gorgeous, Filet Mignon, Beef Ancho, Lombo (pork loin filets encrusted with parmesan cheese!), Frango chicken wrapped in bacon...yay, Linguica (slow-roasted pork sausages) and my favorite, Cordeiro, the leg of lamb, moist and delicious!  This is a great concept for a restaurant, I can't wait to bring my husband for his birthday!

Definately original, I overheard my fiancées step-mother talking about this place before, and today we needed to get a Christmas gift for her so went to check it out. The owner was very helpful, she knows her product. She sold us a custom gift box with a fantastic selection of both sweet and savory balsamic and olive oils.  Some of the olive oils we tried were chipotle, basil and picual, some of the vinegars were tangerine, raspberry and pear. Really a fun experience, I will be back for myself soon!

Woohoo! I finally got to try a Pasty! I've tried to go to the Tempe spot a few times, but it was either almost closing, so kitchen was closed, or lunch, too busy. But this weekend the 101 to our house was closed, so had to take a detour down Dobson, passed CPC, and yelped (do I get a prize for working that in?) at my husband to turn the car around! I've been trying to try this place for years, I pleaded.   Boddingtons on tap makes me happy, the Pasty I chose was the asiago chicken with roasted green chili, double happy. Hubby had lamb with a mint sauce, he ate the entire thing, amazing, then had a big fat nap when we got home.  The interior is diner-like they do have much more seating than the Tempe spot (church pews with tables) and a patio at this location. I wouldn't mind coming back for a patio-beer day. Oh and the waitress did mention they might start doing brunch on Sundays soon, including mimosas and bloody marys.

I don't typically review grocery stores, because I don't usually have anything fantastic or tragic happen. But, I guess I have something to talk about now.   I've been to this particular Safeway many times, but a couple months ago when my fiance was sick I happened to ask the pharmacist for any recommendations, she gladly helped me. I went back again tonight with a case of an ear ache, hoping she was working, and she was, and again, she was more than happy to help me find what I was looking for. She also gave me some advice (nothing that would need a neurosurgeon referral or anything) she suggested a warm wet rag, blah blah blah.  Anyway, she was very helpful, more than any grocery store or Walgreen's pharmacist I've ever encountered, so I wanted to give her a Yelp hi-five.   Oh and I scored a decent bottle of wine for less than five bucks. Yay.

I was actually pretty impressed with the service. I went to register for my bridal shower, and I wanted to register at the MAC cosmetic counter at Nordstoms, but they don't have a registry at all, so I went to Macy's. They have a registry, but it's typically for china and luggage apparently, they thought I was a little crazy I think for wanting to register for cosmetics. But they let me and were very accommodating.   So I went downstairs and talked to Shauna at the Clinique counter, she really knows what she's talking about. and is very nice. I will definitely be back to see her.  Overall, I don't typically visit department stores, feels so 90's or something. But after this experience, I might rethink my patronage.

Sometimes I get a real hankering for Indian food.  We decided by the reviews we read to try Tandoori Times.  LOVE IT.  We've been back a few times since.    Everything I've tried there I've loved.  My favorite is the Saag Ghost.  My only disappointment is that they don't serve Pakora's at dinner, and I never make it there for lunch.  But they redeemed themselves by having one of my favorite white wines on the menu (Torrontes).    The belly dancer is cool, just make sure you don't sit under one of the speakers in the ceiling, they crank it.

Ahh yeah, the White Rooster is soo good. I've been here a few times now and love it. Visited tonight and brought some family and friends, everyone loved it. Let me see if I can remember some of the drinks and dishes that were ordered.   I'll start with me, I had to have the grilled corn appetizer, which I absolutely love (grilled corn on the cob with mexican cheese and smoked paprika) and a few tacos, carne asada and orange marinated pork - pretty freekin good. My husband ordered the chilaquiles, he thought they tasted really fresh and light. There was also an ahi tuna that looked good, some sort of mexican hamburger and a carne asada torta - reported as being pretty tasty. There were also four salsas to choose from, a good variety of spiciness and flavors, all fresh.  We also had a few drinks, started with the fresh squeezed margarita (yay) and then moved on to the paloma: tequila, grapefruit, soda and fresh lime. I don't usually like grapefruit, but this was fresh and delicious!   We ended with the flaaaaaaan, caramel, oh yeah, with a single cute birthday candle in it.   Love the interior, rustic and cool, everyone got a kick out of the mens urinals and Dyson hand dryers. The only problem is it's noisy, I noticed this last few times I was there and tonight with 10 people it was even harder to hear, even a foot away, luckily we are a loud bunch.   Overall, fresh, tasty and we also got good service. Thanks Gallo!

I love this place...for happy hour, otherwise you might want to transfer some money from your savings account.  The inside atmosphere is nice jazzy/loungy, my French Martini is gone in 60 seconds the food is pretty good.  I wish they'd do something nicer with the patio though, it's pretty blah compared to the interior and has very bright lights above it at night.  I took my boyfriend there for his birthday and we used the free shuttle service, which comes and picks you and your party up and drops you off at home for free.  Be sure to tip Chris well, he's a nice guy and he gets you home without a DUI (ooh, that should be his motto).    My bf loves the Black Pearl martini, I stick to the French, but for 11 bucks, I'd like to see a little more in my glass.  We started with some crab cakes, which were pretty good, nothing spectacular.  He got the seafood pasta, which WAS spectacular, that sauce was delicious, just wish it came with some bread or something to sop up the remainder.  (a pasta dish with no bread? mama mia!)  I had the butter lettuce salad, asked for the dressing on the side, didnt come that way unfortunately, it was too much dressing for me.  But I'm still alive.    Dessert was another martini, esspresso, and the jazz band played the happy birthday tune for my boyfriend, aww sweet.

We (me and husband) are pretty happy with the location of this new wine bar, since it's within bike-riding distance from our house. The decor is nice, cool patio with couches, full bar and a nice little menu.   We met some friends there last Friday night thinking it would be semi-quiet since it just opened, but it was pretty busy, not complaining, I'm happy places around here are busy.   The only thing is it was packed with cougars, cougars acting like 20-year-olds, so not really our thing. But maybe it will calm down after it's open a little longer, crossing our fingers, we really wanted to like this place.

BLD, I'm doing this for your own good. My husband and I are huge fans of Cork, so when we heard you were opening a new spot and that we are located in-between the two, we were super excited. Unfortunately, we have been really let down.   The first two times I visited I figured they were just still working things out, so was trying not to be too hard on them. But, the sandwich I ordered was pretty greasy and the second time we visited the waiter apparently had nothing else to do, and checked on us an annoying amount of times. They seem to have way too many staff there, most who seem to be very inexperienced and nervous, which makes for an uncomfortable experience.   Yesterdays experience was unacceptable. We were sat at lunch, and then sat and sat some more. I kept trying to get the attention of anyone of the 5 servers who were working in our section, nobody even looked at us. Finally we had to leave because nobody came to our table after 15 minutes and hubby only has an hour for lunch.   Two stars because I have hope, we are going to let them work out the kinks and try again in a few months.

I'd like to report that we came back to try BLD again the other day and the service was MUCH better! The food was really great too. I also had a wild berry smoothie, which might be the best smoothie I've ever had.
