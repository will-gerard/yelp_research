This is pretty much the only station I ever listen to. I am a fan of Bruce St. James. I wish he was the prime time slot. He sort of just says the common sense thing. I effing hate people who say "left" or "right" I don't think he is either. I believe people who are on the right are farther away from common sense and then just label everyone else as "liberal" ...   Mac and Gaydos are just OK. There is nothing special about them.   There is a lady who helps with traffic and I hate to be rude but she is AWFUL. She stumbles, stammers, and sounds like a 3rd grader learning how to read. I forget her name, but boy does she stand out.   Dave Ramsey is on at 7. He acts like everyone should just know how to handle money like every other rich person and talks down to others. Some of his advice sounds helpful but he lives in another world.   I have called the Jay Lawrence show a couple of times and he always brushes me off. Once he had the head of the fight fighters union and I suggested that all fire fighting should be volunteer and it didnt go over well.   92.3 stays pretty centered and they also seem to play devils advocate and mostly try to look at things from the point of view of the other side. Its why I listen.

This place is classy, I just think that its a terrible location. It seems like the Esplande (spelling?) is always struggling and places in there close all the time.   The last time I was there it was pretty dead.   When you walk in it is very dark, calm, and has the feeling of a bar in New York that only a select few know about.   The people there are interesting. I would assume they get a lot of well traveled business men with the Ritz being a block away.  The bar is very impressive, polished, and you feel like the bartenders honestly know what they are doing because almost no one there (it seemed) order a beer. You would almost feel awkward ordering a Bud light in a place like this.   I ordered a Martini. It was very good. I believe it was around the $10 price range.   If you are looking for a quieter atmosphere to take a date or maybe a girls night where its not a meat market, I think this place would suit your needs.

I went in yesterday just to get information on rent (just to get prices, wasnt even interested in a tour or anything)... So I walk in and I sit at the desk of this lady with this southern accent and just ask for some basic information....   She asks what I am looking for and I tell her probably a three bedroom town home...   The ENTIRE time she was so condescending I bit my tongue trying to not to be rude back. I don't know WHAT her deal was or if she thought I was dead beat or something.   "If you have EVER had another property have a judgement against you AUTOMATIC DENIAL"  "If you have EVER filed for bankruptcy AUTOMATIC DENIAL"  "We DONT ALLOW M-Power"   Lady... I don't know who you think you are or what kind of pre-judgement you had about me, but seriously I was really interested in a townhome and there is no way you are getting $1300 a month from me because of your attitude.   Furthermore, I will NEVER pay a Non-refundable deposit for pets AND pet rent. You people are freaking crazy.   I thought it was funny how she lit up when I asked her "if they charge people with kids additional rent like people with pets"  "No, that would be against the law" ... But its not against the law to gouge people with pets... I see.

This Bashas' is like a gateway to the mid 90s. I was living in the area as a little kid when this Bashas' was built and I don't think one thing has changed.   When I was living in the area, I would stop here only if it was the most convenient place to stop, Fry's is too far away and Safeway carries a 25% premium on everything they sell.    Quite honestly, this grocery store is pretty terrible. The checkout people are so slow they have to be doing it on purpose. The produce isn't that great, the meat is meh, and their prices don't seem to be very competitive.   I have come to the conclusion that the only reason this Bashas' stays open is their die-hard crowd over 60 years old.   It wouldn't surprise me one bit if the entire strip mall get bull dozed to the ground in the next 3 years.

Sigh... so much potential and trust me I give two stars with a heavy heart.   The place is awesome. Wow, the view, the decor, the theme, the atmosphere is seriously in a league of its own however...   I have been here probably 6-7 time in my life. Every time I get the absolute worse service. Last night we sat in the bar area for 20 min and not one person even acknowledged us.  Then we decided to get a table and was told a 30 min wait with about 30-40 empty tables in plain view so we decided to sit at the bar.   Sitting at the bar we each got a beer and decided to only order one of their appetizers and it was seriously awful. The nachos were stuck to the plate, it was like a 4th grader made it and fried zucchini wasnt even cooked.    The food, the service, and with prices that obscene for what you receive. You could tell the bartender was simply stretched to thin, never asked us if we wanted another beer (we would have had at least one more each)   I want to like this place so much because it really is a landmark but I cant bring myself to pay the prices they want with the service and food that they offer.

Imagine if your stoner rock buddies who loved movies made a man cave and then decided to turn it into a bar, then a music venue, then a restaurant and stay open 20 hours a day...   Thats this place.   Its like the first level of Guitar hero.   I can never get the Wifi to work though

One thing you have to give Starbucks as a company is the consistent nature of the products and services in every store or franchise. This Starbucks is no different and is probably the best ran establishment at Az mills next to the movie theater.   The best piece of advice I can give anyone who visits AZ mills is if you are looking for a healthier food option for lunch at this mall, just eat at Starbucks. Its basically the same price and you have zero options at the food court.

I have been going here for literally years and honestly there isn't enough I can say about this place. For one. Get the Strips. They are magical.There is no other way to describe how something so simple can make people look like crack addicts getting their fix.   When you walk in, you will see every table occupied by people shoving Strips into their mouths with complete satisfaction. For any Mexican food lover, this is place. Every person I have ever taken here is hooked for life. I have never met anyone who has eaten there and not been a fan for life. As for the location, it is not in the best of places.   The building is older, and even though they keep it up, it is still a small and stuffy place. The best time to go is in the winter when the weather is cooler and you can enjoy your treats on the patio and watch the traffic roll by on Arizona Ave.   The prices cannot be beat. I would go there with a group of 5, we will stuff our faces until we cant move for under $25 The staff is friendly and excellent. The same lady who served me 10 years ago for the first time still serves me. Phoenix is a cornucopia of Mexican cuisine.   This is by far the best. You will be hooked for life.

This place is one of my favorite places in Phoenix (actually I suppose its considered South Scottsdale) Located in the Papago strip mall on the South West corner of Scottsdale Road and Mclintock, its kind of hard to spot within the complex (even for someone who has been there before) they could easily use a bigger sign. Lets Start with the beer... it is fantastic with a crazy collection.   Its a bit pricey to me (average over $5 a beer) but its the only place in town where you can find some of the premium brews they offer. Their on Tap collection is pretty impressive, especially with their own crafts. They feature the Orange Blossom which is practically magical. Its refreshing. Growing up in Phoenix, I am not very fond of dark/heavy beers, so the Orange Blossom is perfect. I have tried their other beers and they are all good. For those of you who enjoy dark beers, try their Oatmeal Stout. It is beyond amazing, even for a guy who does not fare heavy beers.   Their food is above par for a bar. Think of one step above a Native New Yorker. The T-Rex pizza is very good and a personal size is big enough for even people with a big appetite. I would HIGHLY suggest their California Turkey Wrap. There is something about it that makes it come together perfectly with the beer.   The Atmosphere is nice when its not too busy. The concrete walls and floors mixed with bright lighting (for a bar) make it somewhat unpleasant when its busy. They also have Darts and Shuffleboard which is awesome for people like me who like to be occupied while drinking and hanging out with friends. I also saw a few board games. All-in-all, its a tad pricey for what they offer in my opinion, but WELL worth a visit just about anytime. Bartenders are awesome and know their stuff.   Check this place out. Any beer drinker will appreciate it. I believe they only serve beer.

This place is odd, but in a good way. It seems like all food and beverages (aside from bottled stuff) is made in house. You can order breakfast, lunch, and dinner and it looks like a home cooked meal.   The set-up and flow is probably the most unappealing. I think everyone who goes here for the first time might feel a bit uncomfortable because its hard to know "what to do" or where to sit.   They have free wi-fi which is cool but there are always 100 people there using it which slows it down quite a bit. All in all there needs to be more places like this. Phoenix is missing a real nice internet cafe. This place is the best by far. Kudos for them.

My buddy and I used to go here all the time when he lived right behind it. The hamburgers are good (Not great) but very very good.   The burgers are from grass fed cows and all that free-range stuff and it does taste different. Its not a greasy dripping hamburger (not saying I dont love those kinds of hamburgers)   I highly suggest getting the sweet potato fries.   Perfect place for date 1 or 101. Its hip and swanky and relaxed.

The only thing you need to learn about being a Goodwill shopper is how to compare it to Wal-mart. For instance... Socks... .99 cents at Goodwill or $4.99 for a new pack at Wal-mart (and don't forget, they are used SOCKS)   Ironing board... $25 at Wal-mart or $6 at Goodwill  Point being, there are things that are literally a couple bucks more anywhere else.   Stop in often but don't be disappointed. Shopping at Goodwill is like visiting a casino. If you expect to win, you will be disappointed 99% of the time.

You really can't have a complaint about this place. Its a giant warehouse full of alcohol. Its what they do, its what they sell, and they have a crap load of it.   Prices seem to be fair and on par with just about any other liquor store, as in, you get what you pay for.   The only thing is you would think they would be open later.

The Bartender working 12/9 at 7pm made our experience worth it (male with tBlack framed glasses). To tell you the truth, when we first arrived we almost walked out. We stood there for about 5 min waiting to be seated. We were acknowledged about 5 times but no one sat us. We finally said screw it and sat ourselves on the patio since we wanted to sit there anyways (this place has a great view of the Fountain Hills Fountain)   So, we waited about 10 minutes on the patio to see if were going to be served. Nope... no one said hello or anything. At that point we just sat at the bar.   The Bartender mentioned above greeted us right away. We didnt say anything about how long we had already been there (we dont make a fuss about dumb shit)   I ordered a Dr Pepper and he told me they were all out, so I ordered coke instead which he went and got me (no big deal)   About 5 min after getting my coke he pops open a can of Dr Pepper (which I thought was cool of him) and said here, sorry I found a can of this stuff in the back. (Nice)   We ordered our food which was pretty damn good. My girlfriend ordered a Flatbread that in the decription didnt mention any meat (she is a vegetarian but not one of those asshole vegetarians) and when we got her food it had pepperoni on it . Once again, no big deal ( I ended up eating it and it was damn good)   But she needed to order something else and once again the bartender was like "oh sorry bout that, lemme help you out" and helped her pick something off the menu that didnt have meat.   All in all, we almost walked out, but that bartender made it worth staying and enjoy the good food they had.   Only complaints was lack of hostess and the poor description on the menu.

So, you're at Tempe Market Place and you don't want to be murdered at Cadillac Ranch and you don't want to pay $6 for a Corona at San Felipe's while choking on Axe body spray, then the Thirsty Lion is your place.   Now, you will pay $5-$6 a beer, but at least the atmosphere justifies the expense. This place is a solid 4 stars all around. The food is seriously good and their beer selection competes with the Yard house.   By looking at the place you would probably think they are real expensive, look at the menu on the wall outside and you will be surprised.   Highly recommended and I can't wait for it to cool off so we can sit on their patio.

Solid four stars all around. I am a little surprised the food isn't a little better. I believe the reason this place stays steadily busy is the service is friendly and personalized.  -Full Bar (only sits 6-7 people)  -huge menu (mediocre food) -Dining room (awkwardly arranged) -Take out  -Good Service   The dining room is a very skeleton and bare atmosphere and the tables are really not set up correctly which makes it loud and a little awkward.   The people who run it are very friendly.

This place is honestly not good. It took the place of paradise bakery. Its the only "healthy" option (I know paradise bakery isn't "healthy" nor can any food found in the mall... But its still better than pizza or panda express) anyways...   I ordered the "Mexican Torta" and it was so buttered that any redeeming health value is probably void. Cold chicken, and it slopped together with grade B lettuce and kraft singles cheese. Almost 9 bucks (no drink or anything)    I know its mall food but no one even tries anymore

I hate leaving bad reviews. But some establishments just deserve them.   I have been here twice. Had the same experience, twice.   First off, we are huge Denver Broncos fans, which is the reason why we thought this would be a great place to be on a Sunday. If we had (at least) a decent experience, we would probably be there every single Sunday.   1. There was nowhere to sit both times we went. In my opinion, they weren't even that busy. Seriously terrible use of space.   2. First time, we were there for about 15 min. Didn't get one drink nor a place to sit. Staff literally treated us like we were in the way and didn't offer us once to find us a place to sit or help, and actually didn't even acknowledge we were there. Being honest and not even exaggerating.   3. Second time we were there, same seating issue. I got the bar....  Me: Can I get a pitcher?  Bartender: hands me a small pitcher. No glasses.   Me: Can I get two glasses?   Bartender: ::Rolls Eyes:: (seriously!) gives me two glasses.   Now, the only place to sit was outside and it was raining  which wasn't a huge deal. I asked the bartender for a towel to wipe off the table and got a pretty good scolding about how I had to check in with the hostess if I wanted a table. She was literally one of the rudest bartenders I have ever had. Lol.   As soon as I was done with the small pitcher we packed up and headed to The sports grill across the street.    Overall, this place is terrible on a Sunday. You would think people in head-to-toe Broncos gear would be treated decently since the potential to earn weekly business is so great.   Literally not one person working there was helpful, accommodating, or friendly. Bouncers literally just stared at us as we looked for a place to sit.   Hope this helps anyone looking to hangout here.

Food, service, prices, atmosphere deserve nothing less than 5 stars.   Food was absolutely top-quality and quite honestly the best hamburger I have ever had at a restaurant.   2 hamburgers, 2 drinks, and large fries was $27. For two people, that's just over what you would pay at Chipotle.   The Bar Tender working Friday night at 6:30 (can't remember her name) provided the best service I have received in a long time.   I would recommend Hop Doddy to anyone. Seriously, nothing but good things.

I recently moved out of this place and I would like to share 100% honest reasons why NOT to move here.   1. Expect your water to be shut off at least once a month. And expect to be notified about the shut-off only after it happens.   2. Never expect your voicemails to be returned. I left at least 10 over the course of a year and not one was ever returned.  3. The a/c and venting are incredibly poor. If you like to sweat while you sleep AND have your unit run non-stop, then you will love this place. And yes, I called maintaince twice for this reason and was told "it works"... yes it works, but poorly.  4. Do NOT get a unit that is on or close to Gold Dust Ave. The road noise is terrible, seriously TERRIBLE. Nice weather and want to sit on your patio? Better get used to guys who like to rev their motorcycles at 2am.   5. The kitchen is ridiculously small. The wall outlets all fell out a month after living there.   6. Don't expect a parking space if you are a two car family and get home after 6pm.   7. DO NOT get a unit with vaulted ceilings. Was showed a model and told my unit had vaulted ceilings, then didnt mention that the ceiling was 25 feet high. Unless you are into that much of a waste of space and heating/cooling costs (with an A/C unit that sucks).   8. Be prepared to pay an additional $25 for "Valet Waste" where someone comes by at 8 pm and grabs your trash. Was never told about this service (took me 2 months to figure it out) and there is no opt-out, you have to pay for it. Plus, it looks terrible with everyone's trash sitting in front of their door.   Quite honestly, this is probably the worst place I have ever lived. On top of living in Scottsdale which is not as awesome as people say it is. It smells like sewage everywhere you go, there is  heavy traffic 7 days a week at all hours, and the people are rude.

This place is actually really good. They are "Tex Mex" Style and are better than most I have tried in the Valley. We spent about $15 the first time around and received quite a bit of food. The rolled taco were really good and tasted like real meat. The burritos are gigantic and their meals seem robust and diverse.   I think the toughest challenge for this place will be its location. If you are travelling east on Ray road it is very difficult to get to and get out of.   Make the U-turn, its worth it.   They are open super late too which is pretty cool for drunk munchies.

"Oh so SodaSopa"  Just because it wasn't for me, doesn't mean it's poorly operated or doesn't execute its business model well. Overall, service was pretty excellent (waitress seemed annoyed a tad, like we weren't  spending enough or something and hence the 4 stars). Beer was cold. glasses were clean. Seated quickly. Well organized and managed extremely well.   Friday night at 10pm. Late 20s/early 30s crowd with the mixed divorced mid 40s/50s. Obviously a place people go to be seen. There isn't anything about the decor, music, or people that isn't cliche white Scottsdale Millennial with disposable income.   We didn't try the food. The mixture of Asian/Mexican seems contrived to me but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.
