Here's the deal with George & Dragon, you get exactly what you should expect... perhaps a bit more. The patio at this bar is my spot. Nothing like having a cold one and a scotch while watching Central go by and hearing the random serenade of the light rail as it cruises. The crowd is lively and animated. You can always find yourself in a conversation and the people are eclectic. The staff is one of the most solid in town. They remember you and what you drink, they smile and are attentive and are good at keeping you drinking. If you show up and go straight to the patio, I suggest letting someone know you've arrived if there isn't already some action out there. Otherwise you might wait for a bit before you're noticed. The owner is often seen having a pint or laughing and joking with the patrons which I see as excellent form. Plus, he's a damn funny bastard. The beers miiiiiight be a little pricey but you can get a domestic bottle on the cheap, if it suits you. Now, the food... PHENOMENAL. Surprisingly good! And the kitchen is open until 1am. Best bangers & mash in town (quality of the sausage is exemplary). Fish n' chips is superb. The stuffed meatloaf is legendary. LOVE the Cornish pastie. I would bathe in a tub of the chicken curry. Honestly haven't had a single disappointment and I've traversed the menu a few times over. All in all, I love this place. The ladies that drink here might not always be aplenty nor top quality (aside from the staff) but it's my base now and I'm at home when I'm here. Keep 'em comin'.

As far as Jiffy Lubes go, you're always waiting for them to upsell you on something you might not need. This was the first time that didn't happen. They did tell me a few things that I needed to do but things I could do cheaper on my own, like replacing wiper blades and I was missing my power steering cap (which I know I forgot to put back on last time I filled it). But they didn't even try for a new air filter, which was new but I was waiting for them to go for it.  On top of that, their demeanor and customer service was great! I don't know his name but the guy with big 'fro was very cool and personable and fun to BS with! :)  Thanks, guys, for the honest work! I'll be coming back to this location every time.

Well, I did it again this past weekend. Drove 30 minutes from downtown to have the Irish Breakfast at Skeptical. It's odd that, living in central Phoenix and being surrounded with Irish pubs and the like, that the best Irish Breakfast in town is up in North Scottsdale.  The black and white pudding are top notch (I always double my order) and the eggs are perfect. Bangers and rashers are great and the grilled tomatoes taste fresh, always.  The Skeptical Chymist is just an all around SOLID establishment and has everything a successful pub needs.  - Extensive drink and beer selection  - Friendly, astute waitstaff and bar  - Plenty of seating  - Great patio  - Great live music  - Plenty of TVs for watching the game  - AMBIENCE!!!  Don't change a thing... especially the Irish Breakfast. Did I mention that part?  Wish I could eat 2.

This is one of the best little quick-style Mexican food joints I've found. Compared to all of the 'Bertos out there, this place is second to none.  The quality of the food soars over similar places while the prices coudn't be any lower. I work across the street from Amados with one of those 'Bertos right around the corner. I will never even consider going over there when Amados is the much better choice.  Try the cabeza taco or the chorizo burrito if it's breakfast time! And the rolled tacos are perfect here!

Got my first tattoo with Heather and I couldn't have asked for a better, more professional yet more personal experience!!!  From the start, Heather and Marge were BEYOND accommodating, before I even walked into the shop. I wanted to get a 13 on my inner right bicep and it was important for me to get it done on Friday the 13th but I didn't want it to be just something from a pre-selected sheet.  Being the procrastinator that I am, I waited until a few days prior to call, only to find out that the shop was doing a Friday the 13th event and weren't taking any appointments for the day.  But when Heather found out how important the piece was to me (13 is my lucky number and the day of the month my daughter was born, so I was going for a trifecta), she went above and beyond to get me in. She even offered to stay late into the evening, after hours, after a full day of work just to make sure I was able to get in. Luckily we didn't have to go that route because I know how it is at the end of your work day. When I'm out, I'm OUT!!! Through numerous texts and phone calls, Heather got me in at 7pm, again, when they WEREN'T taking appointments.  I walked into the shop for my appointment and was greeted warmly by the people up front, even some of the waiting customers! Haha The atmosphere was clean without feeling all "clinical" and relaxed without feeling sloppy and lazy. My nerves were put at ease immediately. Heather sat me down and knew exactly what I was aiming for. I was stoked.  Sitting in Heather's chair was relaxing and we really had a good conversation about all sorts of things while she worked on me. We laughed, we cried, we had wine and cheese, we sang showtunes... Ok, not really but we definitely laughed. I totally would have wine and cheese with Heather, though.  Many people had told me that the area I was getting worked on was one of the more sensitive. Heather's technique was phenomenal and I don't even think you could categorize what I felt as "pain". At one point after she got started I looked over and asked, "Is that it?" She said, "yep," and I said "F*** yeah. GO!"  The resulting tattoo is perfect and has inspired more than a few friends, already tattooed and not, to go see her for their own pieces.  I will go back to Heather for every future piece and will recommend this shop to anyone I talk to. Thank you, Heather and THANK YOU, LADY LUCK!!!

My employer goes through this establishment to provide lunch for the office. Looks like I'll be taking a different option next time.  All I ordered was the Antipasto Salad. You've got to be kidding me. Throwing 4 old olives, some grated parmesan and 2 slices of a salami cold cut (cut into 4 pieces) is NOT a friggin' antipasto.  This is a joke. And I'm not easily turned away from restaurants.  Guess there's a first time for everything. Way to go.
