Definitely won't be back. Prices are ridiculous for the quality. Not to mention the service ( I'm in the industry). The pumpkin curry entree was $18 and mediocre at best.

Tried the late night menu at the bar tonight, awesome food, awesome prices! Service was on point, thanks to Dustin! I greatly appreciate the industry discount for restaurant employees. We'll be back soon to try the full menu!

It doesn't get much better. Service was great. All the employees serve a purpose in each dinning experience so there's a great flow to the meal. I had side kale salad and was pleasantly surprised. Backyard burger was delish. And the kids menu hits the spot for all parents. Thanks guys!

Um YES!! We tried quite a few different items-- chicken, shrimp, mahi mahi, and bacon tacos. Of those the mahi was the best. We also got the veggie burrito which was surprisingly the highlight of the meal. Absolutely amazing. The only thing that I recommend improving is the corn tortilla which fell apart. Mucho Macho Taco is a great addition to the neighborhood!
