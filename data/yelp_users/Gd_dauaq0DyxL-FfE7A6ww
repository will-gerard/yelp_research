There are a lot of wine bars popping up across the Valley in the last few years and they are pale imitations of this.  Postino's is great.  Love the atmosphere and the Bruschetta boards are amazing.  Lots of choices and each board is a large serving, big enough to share.  Perfect place for happy hour with the $5 glasses of wine.  I can't wait for them to open their Gilbert location.

I am having my wedding here in October and they have been so wonderful.  Offering to help coordinate with all my vendors, giving me suggestions for bakers, and honest feedback on people they have worked with in the past.  I will update after the wedding but so far I am satisfied.

As an update to my previous review, I have since learned that the staff here was extremely rude to my wedding coordinator and the caterers on the day of the event.  Very sad to learn that as I loved the place. Additionally, I had to contact them weeks later to determine the status of my security deposit.  At the time they explained to me the reasons why I was not receiving any of it back, and I won't argue that with them, it was in the contract; however, send me a letter or call me and let me know.  I shouldn't have to track you down to find this out.

I discovered this jewel while looking on the Internet for Indian food near my office and was very pleased.  While dinner can be a little pricey, lunch is extremely affordable.  I loved the Chicken Koorma and the Chicken Tikka Masala.  Naan was fresh baked and delicious and was great mixed with Saag Paneer.  I have introduced a  few friends to it now as well who love it too.  The service depends on who your waiter is.  I have had good service and poor service but will keep returning for the food.

I had heard a lot about this hamburger place and was very excited to try.  Was not disappointed. The burger was tasty and HUGE.  I could have split it with someone.  And I loved the sweet potato fries and dipping sauce. The seating on the inside is a little odd as we sat at a long bar across from one another but the space is not big so they had to be creative.  Wish that the prices had been a little less but if I split it, it would have been a perfect cheap lunch.

Excellent and inventive menu.  The owner is very friendly and hands on.  I love the Lobster hand roll and they have a great dynamite roll but I can't remember the name, It has a small dining room and sushi bar and can get a little crowded on Friday nights but the quality and price make it worth any short wait. The only reason I didn't give it a five star is that sometimes the service can be a little slow and make sure you tell them you like the sake hot.  Sometimes it is just warm.

My favorite nail place.  My pedicures last FOREVER.  Salon is clean and staff is friendly but they let me relax.  Wish it was a little closer to my house but I am willing to drive.  It's that good.

Had lunch here with a co-worker today and really liked it.  Good atmosphere and we didn't have to wait for a table but wasn't dead either.  Had the Funghi pizza which was amazing.  The crust was awesome.  Had the Cesar salad but we both agreed that the dressing was very bland and there wasn't much of it. Lots of menu items that I still want to try and would definitely reccomend.

This new restaurant is in the lobby of the Arizona Grand Resort and initially I wasn't sure what to expect from the name.  The atmosphere was great, with a beautiful view of the golf course's first tee.  Great patio for cooler weather.  My first trip I sampled the rib-eye.  I was blown away.  It had this wonderful smoky flavor to it that I hadn't had before.  Cooked to perfection and served with a bulb of roasted garlic. Yum.  One of the best steaks that I have ever had.  I went back for lunch with a friend a few weeks later.  We got these great little wonton chips and dip brought to our table that were quite tasty.  We both had the cream of mushroom soup to start that had a great texture and flavor.  Not too heavy on the cream.  Then we both ordered a pizza.  I got the filet with blue cheese and he got the BLT pizza.    When the pizzas arrived I was surprised to see that they were HUGE.  We easily could have split one and still had leftovers.  Got to swap slices and both were excellent.  This would be a great place to take out of towners for a a beautiful dining experience or a great date.  I will definitely go back again.

Amazing family owned Italian restaurant.  I always take out of town guests here and they love it.  The new building in great but it still gets busy on the weekends.  I recommend making a reservation if you don't want to wait. The Chicken Piccata is probably my favorite dish.  Crispy chicken with a yummy sauce and it comes with a side of pasta.  I usually ask for angel hair with tomato cream sauce. My only complaint is when I ordered chicken on one of my pasta dishes once it was very over cooked.  They apologized and removed the chicken charge from my bill.  They offered to make me a whole new dish if I wanted.  Very accommodating.
