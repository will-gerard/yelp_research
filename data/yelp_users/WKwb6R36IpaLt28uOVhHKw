This review is long over due.   I grew up in AZ and now live out of state.  I still have a lot of family and friends in AZ so anytime I need to order flowers I always order through Phoenix Flower Shops.  I've never had an issue and the flowers I've ordered (over the internet) and they have always looked just as beautiful as the pictures which you can't say about a lot of flowers you order online.    Recently I placed an order for a friend and used some of my reward points on my order.  To be honest I've never watched how many points I had etc.  To my surprise 2 days later I received an email from PFS saying they had redeemed too many of my points for my order and for the inconvenience they were going to replenish the points and also gave me additional points for the mistake.  How often does that happen?  That truly is was customer service is all about, fixing a mistake before I even realized it, more business could learn from this.  I sincerely appreciated the email and the effort made to "make it right".  There are other businesses you can call on a mistake and beg for a simple solution.    I have used PFS for years and will continue to do so.  They truly define customer service and create exceptional beautiful work!

Yummy!!!! We love this place. We love to be able to support a local business vs. a chain. It makes it so easy to when you always get wonderful service and good food. We've always had wonderful service and our food has always been made as ordered and good flavor.

Two stars for service and that's about all.   The first table we sat at was falling apart, it was wobbling so bad that we asked to switch tables. Later in the evening a group of older folks were seated there and they switched it out with another table and commented that that hadn't even started drinking yet and the table was wobbling terribly. Get a wrench and fix the table...   Ordered the Spinach, avocado and CHICKEN salad and it was a bowl of spinach with 4 small pieces of avocado, and about 4 scraps of chicken. I'm convinced there wasn't even one ounce of meat in the salad. I've seen more chicken in a chicken nugget. So 10.99 for a bowl of spinach... Fail.   We also ordered calamari and if I was smart we would have taken a picture, it looked like the scraps that had been left at the bottom of the fryer.   Everyone at our table had iced tea, and each glass came with no ice, even refills, no ice. We finally had to ask for a glass of ice.   We had a pizza and it was OK not terrible but based on everything else, not good enough to have to ever come back and eat here ever again.   Our server and all the employees we spoke with were all lovely. That's about all this place has going for them.

Service was pretty subpar. We walked in early on a Sunday afternoon. There was no hostess and the women that was tending bar looked straight at us several times in the 5 min we stood there but never once acknowledged us. Finally someone came and seated us. Food was ok it wasn't amazing and we most likely would have occasionally gone back if we didn't feel the service was so bad. Also they ended up turning on the ceiling fans half way through our meal and we got a nice little shower of dust from them. They could use a little dusting on all the knock knacks and statues etc.

I don't get why people think this place is so wonderful. We tried it three separate times and now I'm done. The food is subpar at best it's along the lines of black angus and the service was even worse. We've done the Bly salad to steaks and all of it lacked flavor, poor presentation, and overpriced. The last time we went they had about 6 servers all standing around the back wall looking bored out of their minds. Even with all of them standing there it took forever to get refills on our water and tea. There are just so many better places to spend your money. I'm convinced winter visitors keep them in business.

Service is "OK". Last time we went in we ordered chicken wings. When we got them they were undercooked. Yes, we should have said something but we were so grossed out and weren't having the best service experience so we just paid our bill and went on our way.

I have to say the best part about our visit here was the service.  The food was good as well, I had the BBQ sandwich with fries and drunkin apples.  It was yummy and extremely filling.  The service though was awesome!  We were visiting from CA and our server was extremely attentive even with the place being packed.  We will definitely go back again on our next visit to AZ.  Our family that lives there goes in at least once a month.  I can understand why.  YUMMY and good service!  What more is there?  :)

Oh how we've missed good pizza. We lived in the San Francisco Bay Area and good pizza was hard to come by. We always order from this Barros and we've always had excellent service, pizza has always been fresh and hot. We're not a fan of their wings but we love their pizza. The cheese bread is a hit in our house as well.

Love this place!!! Local and not a chain so love supporting them. Gold wings are awesome and meatball subs are yummy too. They also deliver if you live close enough. :)

We really like China Grill. We tried a few other local places that left menus on our door and they we're subpar compared to China grill. We've always gotten delivery and our order has always been correct and within the promised time. We love the crab puffs and also shrimp and veggies. They are our go to for Chinese food.

I grew up in AZ and still have family there so every trip home going to Pappadeaux's is a MUST!  They have the greatest food and a huge selection even for those who don't like seafood.  They have great Oysters and Jose the oyster shucker is the best!  The staff there is always warm and inviting and even when you have to wait on weekends they have a great live band out on the patio.  It's always packed so I would recommend reservations.  I usually get the steamed muscles and the cedar block salmon which is sooo yummy it's served with asparagus that is the best I have ever had in a restaurant.  If you are going to Phoenix or live there, this place is a MUST!

I love this place and every time we go home to AZ to visit family we make it a point to go to dinner here.    The bread they bring out is so yummy we always get a few plates of it.  I (being a creature of habit) always order the Chicken Lemone.  It is pasta, chicken, artichokes, capers and lemon with a lemon butter sauce.  It's soooooo yummy.  My mom always gets the drunken shrimp which she loves.  The only thing I wasn't really impressed with was the Mista Salad.  It was made with iceberg lettuce which I thought was odd and had mushrooms in it (which I love) just not your traditional Mista salad and the dressing could use a bit more flavor.    The staff is very friendly and we have always received great service.  Would definitely recommend to friends and family and anyone visiting AZ.

Another place we really wanted to like. Service was ok, nothing special. The food was meh, really lacked in flavor. The most annoying part of our meal here was the flies. They had the patio door open and we were seated by the front door. The entire meal was spent swatting flies. We think there are much better Greek places with much better service and food then Pita Jungle.

Love this place and love not having to drive to Scottsdale for a nice dinner. We've gone a few times and actually always ended up with the same server (Marcy), who is wonderful. The food is so yummy, I always get the filet and it's so tender I can cut it with my fork, yes I'm not kidding. Our meals have always been prepared as ordered, taste delicious, and great service.  It's our go to "let's have a nice dinner" place and not drive far. We would highly recommend.

This is our go to breakfast place. We love supporting a local business vs a chain.  We've always received great customer service. They have a lot to choose from and their pancakes are huge!!!  Family friendly and casual environment. The weekend staff is great and they do a great job getting through the amount of people quickly without making you feel rushed.

So The Gym in Glendale just opened about a week ago (Nov. 30th) and it's a great place. It's a decent size with a separate bar area and a Patio off the bar (coming soon). The other side is set up restaurant style and is open to families etc.   They have tons of big screens TVs every where with all sorts of different events playing which is nice. Everyone at our table could see more than 1 TV from where they were sitting.   The menu is HUGE with tons to choose from. Everything from sandwiches, burgers, wings, pizza, to traditional like pork chops etc. They also have a ton of different beers.   Our party had the Ruben Sandwich, Cheeseburger, and Pork Chop with fruit salsa. We got sweet potato fries with the sandwich orders. All the food was really good and fresh. It all had great flavor as well. This location is managed (owned?) by two brothers. I would recommend to anyone it's a fun place and pretty busy when we went on Saturday night. They have most of the parking lot as the other businesses in the complex are 9-5 except for Gym ( a exercise one) and an In n Out that they are building.   Definitely a great place, friendly staff, great food, and cool atmosphere.

I don't even know where to begin!  Everything about our experience was first class and we were so thrilled with the finished product.  I let her know she is now going to have to do birthday cakes for us for life.    Elizabeth was genuinely easy to deal with, honest and provided wonderful customer service.  We gave her a pretty complex cake and she did a beautiful job on it, so much that it made us sad to have to cut it up and serve it to our guests.    Not only did the cake look absolutely fabulous, but it also was delicious!  I'm so happy we found her and can not wait for our next birthday adventure with her.  I would absolutely recommend her without hesitation!

I don't get it. Yes, they have exceptional customer service, but I don't think their coffee is worth waiting in a normal line of 11-15 cars deep. It's coffee, it doesn't have a superior taste to other coffee places but I guess if you have time to kill waiting in line at least the customer service is awesome. We will go occasionally if there is a short line just to support them but again I don't get why it's worth waiting in a line 15 cars deep. Guess I'm old and have too much other stuff to get done.

We don't do "quick" meals often. However the one time we stopped in here we were really pleased. The customer service was excellent. From the moment we walked in to the point of where they offered us an extra bag for a box of muffins we had bought next door. Super friendly staff that engaged with their customers. Our sandwiches were yummy and it will be a place we return to on those rare occasions we look for something quick and easy. Way better then a subway or jimmy johns. Etc.

We go here for breakfast burrito on occasion and when they decide they will be open. They have open 24hours signs up but there have been numerous times where we have tried going between 6 am -8 am and not a soul is there. Sometimes they even have a cone blocking the drive through. So it's hit or miss if they will even be open when you go. Not sure why they just don't update their signs. They clearly are NOT open 24 hours.

Meh... Over priced, and lack of flavor. Saw the good reviews on Yelp and figured it was worth a try. Also figured with small menu and being drive through it would be hard to mess up. It was disappointing, meat seemed overcooked, and lacking flavor. We only tried the tacos, maybe some day we may go back and try the burritos but it won't be a first choice on our list.

Love this place. The food is yummy and it's always been what we've ordered. We haven't been in awhile just because the last time we went we had a bad server to the point where it just really rubbed us the wrong way. We eventually will give them another try, prior service has always been great and the food has always been delicious and fresh. For whatever reason we are just having hard time getting over the last bad server. We have recommended to lots of friends and family.

The owner reached out to me after my original review and went above and beyond to correct the bad service we felt we received. That simple action alone spoke volumes about how they truly care about their customers experience. We've since been back a few times and received wonderful service both times. We truly appreciated the effort the owner put into making up for us having a bad experience. We will always recommend Angry Crab Shack! Yummy food and a place that truly cares about taking care of their customers.

While their food is nothing amazing or to rave about, it's an easy drive through meal that is better than other drive through options.  However, the last THREE times we've gone through the drive through our order has been incorrect every single time.  So it will probably be awhile before we come back.  The errors are just too much to justify continuing to go.  1) the first time we ordered a kids meal (grilled cheese), got home to find out there was no sandwich in our kids meal.  Just a milk, cookie and bag of grapes.  So I ended up making our daughter a sandwich at home.  2) The second time in our kids meal we received grapes, chips, two milks, and a sandwich.  Our sandwich order (adult meals) was correct. 3) Third visit in the drive through, ordered potato salad with one of our sandwiches and didn't receive it, (received green salad instead), iced tea was supposed to be large and was given a reg.  They obviously need some quality control on the drive through line.  It appears reading through the other reviews that we are not the only ones who have had issues with receiving the correct order via the drive through.
