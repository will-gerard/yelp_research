Was very excited to to find a a great coupon for this place in the Student Insider. Angie did my mani/pedi and it was one of the best I've ever had. She was very sweet and conversational, but didn't talk my ear off. I could tell that she actually cared about the service she was giving. She would always ask me if I liked the shape, shade, etc of what she was doing so far before she went on. She was also very meticulous about making sure my French tips were symmetrical. The place overall felt very clean and bright. I was greeted several times by different technicians, so I felt very welcomed and appreciated as a customer. Would definitely recommend. Ask for Angie!

After two negative experiences, I wanted to give this location another chance, only to be severely disappointed once again.  Upon walking into the door, I am greeted (if you can call it that) with a, "What's the last name." The girl behind the counter obviously could care less about customer service since she gave less than none. Not even a hint of a smile. The girl looked as if she were going over everything else she would rather be doing in her head. I felt not only unwelcome, but disrespected as a paying customer.  I came with a friend who had never done a spray tan before, and I let the girl explain to her how to do it. I myself have worked in a tanning salon for over 5 years, and every direction that the girl gave my friend was 100% wrong. To keep my friend from having her spray tan ruined, I explained the correct way for her to apply barrier cream, pose, etc.   When it came my turn for the spray tan, I stepped into the booth onto the metal plate and was pracitcally standing in a puddle (a problem I had had before). I went up to the front and asked (very politely), if she could please wipe down the plate because it was still very wet. Not only did the girl roll her eyes at me, but she did not entirely wipe the plate. I was still standing in wetness during my spray.  On top of everything else, I ended up having water drip on me from the ceiling of the booth due to the fact that the machine had not been properly wiped down after sanitization. Any vet spray tanner will know how detrimental having water drip on you during a spray tan can be.   It goes without saying that I will not be returning to this location any more, and neither will my friend.   If any managers are reading this and are interested to know who the girl was that was working, I visited on 10/7/12 at 6 pm at the Tempe location.

Came here with a friend for the first time on Taco Tuesday and was very pleasantly surprised! This business is actually under new ownership and in the process of transitioning their menu. I attempted to order a couple things from the menu, but my waiter told me they were no longer offering those items. Normally, this would be frustrating, but our waiter was extremely accommodating and proactive in getting the closest substitute. He even provided my friend and I with a free drink the restaurant wanted to test out. The tacos, (only $1 on Tuesday!) despite being tiny, were extremely flavorful and filling. I tried 3 different kinds, and each was more delicious than the last! Despite not being a huge tequila fan (but it was too cheap to pass up, and kind of mandatory on Taco Tuesday), I really enjoyed my watermelon margarita! With a great patio, delicious food and drinks, friendly staff, and crazy low prices (3 drinks, 4 tacos, and chips and salsa came out to less than $20...), I will most definitely be back! Can't wait for the grand re-opening festivities!

Really excited about this new business! The space is really cool, there are lots of tables and free wifi, so it's a perfect place to study while getting a caffeine fix. They also support the Salvation Army that is right next door by donating a portion of their proceeds to them. The coffee is SUPER  cheap.
