Looking for a great break job at a good price? This place is thorough, efficient and honest.  When I showed up a little after 8am there were already 2 cars ahead of me.  Mark gave me a realistic time estimate for my free brake check and after the diagnosis, they efficiently completed the job and I was on my way.  Mark was personable, courteous, informative and old school honest.  What a rare and welcomed combination!

I have been going to Dr. Riley for 15 years and he is a gem! Always empathetic, great listener and keeps current on medical trends. Very well read and has an incredible bedside manner. I would recommend him to anyone.

So.... I have been here many, many times and agree that peak hours might not be the time to come if you are in a hurry or don't want to stalk someone to find a table, but it is the perfect place to come if you come during off hours or want to people watch.  I would have to say that the French Pancakes w/fruit and creme fraiche and organic coffee are my staple.  My main complaint was by the time I pick up my food and get settled at my table, they were cold or warm at best.    My bf came in from North Carolina for a visit and she wanted to revisit her fave bfast spot so we made it up to LGO around 9:30 on a Monday.  To my pleasant surprise they had changed their plasti-ware/plate service to the real thing!  Oh... how I love an unexpected surprise especially of the non-plastic nature.  We ordered French Pancakes, Croque Madame, Pumpkin/choco muffin, Almond croissant and coffee.  All yummy and perfectly hot for our dining pleasure.    As always, browsing through their supply of fun and funky stuff in the "maybe I can't live without this trinket" section leaves you wanting to buy that special something for yourself.  I wonder if I can ever get past this evil LGO marketing technique.  So.... come in and enjoy during off hours and miss the table stalking and parking nightmare.  It is definitely a good value and good food.

I have gone to this location a couple of times for tires and also stopped by when I thought I had a nail in my tire and have always received excellent service.  When I stopped because of the nail in my tire, they advised me that it was actually a screw that hadn't damaged my tire.  They could have easily charged me for a new tire, but instead they were honest and had me on my way quickly.  My favorite perk to this place is that they have a station set up for you to pull up, have an employee check the air in your tires and fill them if needed and you are on your way.  :)

So it has been a looooooong time since I have eaten at Cyclo and had an opportunity to have a little Vietnamese lunch so there I sat.... waiting for my friend.  The place looks great!  lively fun new interior.  I was sat promptly and offered water with a bit of mint (nice touch).    I ordered the short rib appetizer and crispy chicken.  My friend ordered the mixed grill.  The short ribs as I remember did not disappoint.  Succulently flavorful making me dream of taking a full order of them home just to smell in the car!  The crispy chicken had great flavor, but was a little over cooked.  (of course that didn't stop me from eating it.)  My friend really liked the mixed grill and loved the atmosphere.    Before I would have given 5 stars, but today a 4.  Don't let that stop you from trying though... It is definitely worth trying and I'd say a little more lively at dinner.

I live right by this place and was never sure if it was open or closed BUT don't let that deter you from going in.  There is a big tree right in front that makes it a little secluded covering the front door and sign, but I finally walked over the other day and now I can't get enough!  It is clean inside and has an older feel due to the  oak wood refrigerators behind the counter.  I had the Sicilian sub.... the bread was perfectly crunchy toasted to perfection.  I'm not sure if I actually took a breath through the whole sandwich! If you are wanting a great sandwich made with TLC definitely give McGurkee's a shot.  My staple is Blimpie and Subway, but they don't hold a candle to this place.

This place is always at the top of my list when I am looking for the perfect piece of unique furniture.  Heidi has always been an incredible resource.  When I was looking for a specific pair of night stands she took the time to try and find out who the maker was and where I could possibly find them.  You don't really come by this type of service very often.    For jewelry, Heidi's one of a kind pieces are modern and edgy, so if you are looking for something truly special, this is the perfect place to look for jewelry and mid century/Scandinavian furniture.

I have a pair of Swiss Flex glasses that I needed new prescription lenses.  Come to find out that they have a "proprietary" lens and installation that only one lab in Phoenix has the capability and you have to be an authorized dealer to order.  If I would have know this when I purchased the glasses, I would not have bought the frames.  I spoke with Libby, who was very polite and knowledgeable and decided to go to her store location.  When I got to Village Eye Works, I was the only customer in the store and was greeted promptly.  The store is very bright and had a nice selection of frames.  Libby asked me some questions about my prescription and as I was speaking with her the phone rang and she immediately picked it up.... rude.  Since I didn't have another option to order these lenses I went ahead and ordered them.  My new lenses will cost around $450 without tax.  I guess Swiss Flex makes sure to support their vendors by only allowing them to order new lenses for customers which also is reflected in the high price.

After our microscopic martini's @ Hanny's, my bf tiff and I decided to walk over to Bar Smith and check it out.  It was a perfect day and we sat out on the front patio.  The bartender came out with a beaming smile to take our order.  We asked what her specialty was and she said Citrus Martini's soooo.... Citrus Martini's it was.  They came out promptly and were DELICIOUS!  (see pics)  We were also in the mood for something sweet so she also suggested the chocolate torte and we are so glad she did.  It was decadent and purrrrrfect.   The music was nice, the weather was as good as it gets in AZ, the service was great and the martini's were yummy. What more could you ask for??  We will be back!

This is my regular pizza take-out place and I love that this tiny little eatery pumps out some pretty great pies!  We order pretty much the same thing each time we go... Vegetarian pizza (loaded with veggies) and a saporita.  I am not a fan of the calamari but am very much a fan of the tiramisu which is DELICOUS.  Gabriel, who I am assuming is the owner, is always friendly and gets us in and out quickly.  This is a consistently good go-to place for pizza.

I live downtown and was sooooo excited that we had yet another restaurant to visit..... especially since it is the same owner as AZ88 which I love!    Went for lunch with my bf and we both started out with a martini.  Mine had St. Germain in it and I couldn't wait!  We waited... and waited.... they finally came and wow... they were in miniature glasses.  Not so happy about the size.  When you order a martini... it should be in a standard martini glass.  They were tasty though, so we ordered a sandwich and a margarita pizza.  Meanwhile, a table of 4 sat down about 5 minutes after us.  Later when the server finally came with their wine bottle and 4 glasses they had already left.  The table next to us told the waitress "I guess they got tired of waiting".   All in all, the food was average, pleasant decor, however, the service needs work.  I look forward to giving Hanny's another shot but will wait a couple of months.

Saw the writeup on this little gem of a restaurant and took my foodie friend to check it out.  Oh so cute inside.... modern 70's style.... great architecture.... love the little living room in the back.  We sat at the bar and ordered a glass of wine and the clam cake appetizer.  They were crunchy on the outside and so flavorful on the inside... and great dipping sauces horseradish and red pepper (we mixed them together!)  I was pretty hungry so I ordered the citrus-brined fried chicken, white cheddar waffles and braised greens. (see pic)  Oh.... heaven!!! so delicious!  I let my friend have a taste of the waffle perfectly crisp and fluffy on the inside.  The chicken looked a little dark, but it couldn't have been better.  I didn't hesitate to lick my fingers!  The greens were bitter so I would definitely see about a substitution for the veggie next time, but we had an awesome experience.

I have been waiting.... for this place to open.  The newest addition to a quaint shopping center on Central that is bursting with fun shops.  Lola Coffee is exactly what we needed.  Awesome layout with retro-modern furnishings (looks like stuff from Red Modern) this place has a great vibe.  It's like going over to your coolest friends ultra fun studio.  Me and my bf ordered an americano, latte, blueberry muffin and cinnamon coffee cake.  Coffee was great... of course it would be the owners really know their stuff.  Original owners of Lux and Lola's Tapas... they were both there and such gracious hosts.  We sat down on a comfy couch in the back corner and enjoyed the artwork and liveliness of the crowd.  We skimmed a few magazines on the table.... something for everyone. The cinnamon coffee cake is a must try... I finished every last crumb.  Outside they have some patio seating complete with thoughtful hooks for your canine friends.  Can't wait to go back. I'll be the one with the little dachshund.

I have only been here for brunch, but can't wait to try lunch or dinner on for size!  We were the first table in on Sunday and were greeted right away by our server and felt at home with its cozy interior.  It's a small place but has lots of character with the heavy solid wood and wrought iron furniture.  Love the Dia de Los Muertos art and heavy wood bar with cowhide bar stools and authentic Mexican glassware.  We sampled quite a few of the salsas at the salsa bar and there is a little something for everyone including those that can't take a lot of spice.  This is a big plus for us since our family has spice tolerances from 1 to 10+.  What was on our menu? we tried the divorced eggs (which I added avacado), black mole chilaquiles with chicken, and an egg scramble with side of bacon; all of which were served with black beans.... Delicious and full of flavor! I'll have to post the brunch menu next time since it is not currently on their website.  Each of us would order the same thing again, but so want to try the other items of delicousness on their menu.  I guess we will have to make La Condesa a staple on our restaurant list!

So many wonderful pieces of furniture.... it is hard to stay focused in here!  Even if you are not currently in the market for that perfect addition to your living, dining or bedroom, this place inspires your next purchase.  Whomever merchandises this place should get a gold star because it is like gawking at a celebrity when you enter this place.  There are so many pieces I want in this warehouse it makes me want to just whip out my credit card.  so... the moral of the story?  If you need a cool unique piece or you have a hard to fit space, you might want to give this place a spin.  oh! and don't forget to check out the teddy bear wall.    Inspiration is not lacking here!

If you have someone in your life that has celiac or any type of wheat or gluten allergy this is the place.  Their bagels, waffles and herb bread are works of art made with love.   i don't know how they do it... and I don't really care... I just LOVE that they DO!  The waffles are my favorite and my girlfriend that has severe celiac is obsessed with the bagels.  She told me this is all she wants for her birthday forever!   The noodles that look like egg noodles are a little mushy when cooked so I won't be getting those again, but I was going to fill up on bagels and waffles anyway.

I think the eyeglasses fairy was watching over me when I decided to pop in to this place.  I have been back multiple times and each time receive EXCELLENT customer service and frames/lenses that are a perfect fit.  I truly feel like these guys really care.  The other day, Ray was helping me with new lenses for my sunglasses and knew what type of finish the lenses came with originally.  I purchased these frames 10 years ago somewhere else!  This guy knows his merchandise old and new and will be very willing to help you too.  This place is quality all the way and comes with a higher than average price tag but aren't your eyes worth it?  They do have specials so if you want a deal, check out their website and give them a call.

What a great find!  Don't get to this side of town much, but now I have a reason to make the trip for sure. :) Urban Picnic is small with a loud shout of character.  There is a huge (I mean HUGE) pink plastic overstuffed chair near the front entrance... YOU CAN'T MISS IT. Quirky and I am in love!  (Stop by the funky "Eclectic Monkey Emporium" after you dine for some interesting browsing.)  I had the roast beef sandwich with bread so perfectly crisp and the best beef/horseradish combo I wanna scream! THEN I took the advise of the gal behind the counter and ordered the lavender lemonade so good it isn't rude to slurp!   So... no it isn't rude to slurp or scream here in fact I think the owner, who we met, would just smile and be happy you were sitting on the patio.  My next trip I am sure to try the Roasted Turkey and Stuffing sandwich.... let the pre-screaming begin!!

What could be better than a warm golden glow on your skin that looks natural and is 100% safe?? I don't tan... period, and use sunscreen like it is going out of style, so to find this gem of an airbrush salon that can give me a kiss of sun without the harmful effects is one of my beauty secrets.... though I tell eveyone I can....  so I guess it isn't such a secret!  Ann is a pro. Not only does she use wonderful product to give you your golden glow, she is personable and extremely professional. I love coming in for an appointment because I always know I will get the best service every time!

I've eaten here a couple of times and love this place! Fresh food, quick service, clean and cool casual atmosphere. I would recommend the "killer" sandwich and the egg white omelette with avocado. And it's at the light rail stop. :)

I have been coming to see Dr Albrecht and Holly the hygienist for over 15 years and I have received exceptional care and service every time! These folks REALLY care. Dr Albrecht is always on the cutting edge of restorative and cosmetic dentistry and somehow always remembers the details of your past conversations. I don't know if she keeps a journal or has a photographic memory but either way it's pretty awesome.  If you are looking for a dentist.... this is the place to go.

So I love the location of this place but will I be coming back, probably not. I dropped in at 5 o'clock on Friday and there were three people in the restaurant, one behind the counter. He was friendly and gave me the rundown on their offerings since I've never been into a Potbelly Sandwich shop before. He suggested the Italian sub and it was tasty but pretty expensive, for what you get and nothing out of the ordinary.  You have so many choices at this intersection... You really have to stand out.

Who didn't shed a tear or two when Gallo Blanco left the Clarendon?? Thank goodness there was a back up! Thank you "Lil sister from the same Mister", Otro café! If you haven't tried there chilaquiles  you are in for a real treat. Their red and green salsa and thicker home style chips are just to die for. Drinks? They have that covered too! I haven't tried one that didn't make me smile. Give little sister Otro a try if you haven't already and she will be your best friend.

Wow! This place popped up overnight!  This trendy, casual concept is part coffee bar ~ part wine bar, with the look and feel of one of those cool spots at the airport.  In the wine bar area, their main food is tapas but they do have limited sandwiches, a salad and a couple of desserts.  I tried the V95 dates that were wrapped in prosciutto and stuffed with goat cheese with a little honey. Delicious!  The longer I sat in the wine bar area, the more I felt like I was on vacation.  What a nice alternative spot to take a break at the mall without a long time commitment.
