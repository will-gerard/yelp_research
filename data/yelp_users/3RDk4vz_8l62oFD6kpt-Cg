We stopped here after a couple drinks next door and the burgers and HUGE and delicious!!  I would strongly recommend tying it out.  Good price too!!

My girlfriend and I went for the first time, thought we would check it out after a movie.  Ordered Mona Lisa Penni and one of the wraps along with the Aphrodite salad to go.  Noticed one customer complained they waited 20 min for there Penni.  Mean while we watched them make several orders with no gloves.  Our Penni to go had no side salad however the people that ordered in received one with their meal. Also the food was bland and portion size was definitely not worth the price.  Now after reading this I realize that they forgot our sauces as well.  All in all bad customer service as everyone was new and seemed confused about the menu and the food was overpriced and not very good.  Would not go back.
