I've been here a few times, all with a whole bunch of friends and we are loud so I forgive the waiter for forgetting to bring extra dressing or my soup. I WUV this place. I really REALLLLLLY love this place. Their tomato bisque soup is divine. I can't wait to go again and then to LGO for dessert! WOOT WOOT!

I've shopped here for awhile......I love, LOVE this treasure of a store. Very friendly owner (Nanci). I follow her store on Facebook and love reading up on all the updates and specials they have. I even told her what I was looking for - for my daughters bedroom and within 12 hours she had pictures sent to my e-mail.  I highly recommend this place is you are looking for treasures! :)

I really love this Studio. Decorated modern & clean. Great vibe. I see Allison Hyatt and she does an AMAZING JOB!!! I have tricky hair and it's hard to get the highlights I want but Allison does it PERFECTLY!!! If you're looking for a great hair salon, try out Salon Surreal but make sure you ask for Allison Hyatt!!!!

Well, I hate to do this. Been coming here for YEARS!!! Prices have been wonderful, shopping was fun. You could get a full on outfit for under 10 bucks, you could get decor for super cheap. Went in today after months of not being there. The store was empty, parking lot not full and when I saw the prices of items I could see why! Whoever is the new manager there increased prices so much it's ridiculous! Items that would be a dollar or two at Goodwill is prices at $8-$10 (I'm sure this will hurt the organization they are trying to support, bummer!)  I don't know if I'll be back......unless they get someone in there to price items accordingly.

I've been coming to Yusefs now for awhile to get gyro meat to go, along with their fresh feta, pitas and cucumber yogurt. BEST I'VE HAD! Finally I was able to eat there as they have a kitchen and OMG, it was delis and the prices are fabulous. I ordered the lentil soup and holy cow, it was UNREAL! I got the gyro plate with gyro meat and fresh rice (basmati?) and it was fabulous. Gyro Greek salad was amazing too. I love coming here because the owner is nice and very sweet!!!!!  I recommend you try this little gem!! It's worth the drive!

I like this place for a quick fix. Love the bbq with noodles/rice, eggrolls are ok but I do love the spring rolls. The only issue I have are the boba drinks, they are not very good at all. I wish they would figure it out because if their boba drinks were better, I'd buy a drink daily, seriously! But I do like the place a lot and I think the new owners are really nice.

I'm in love, seriously! We started the night with their calamari, tender and delish. The dinner salads were simple but tasty! The ghnocchi MELTS in your mouth and the spinach/ricotta ravioli is just out of this world! I highly recommend this place. We will be back (again).   But seriously, order the ghnocchi! Hello mommy!   Oh and if Emily is reading this, GTH.

I love, LOVE this store! All the checkout clerks are so friendly and the self check out is awesome for when you're on the go. I coupon like crazy and they are coupon friendly as well when I'm doing my transactions. If you're looking for an item, someone will walk you to it. I highly recommend shopping at this location!!!! Awesome clearance items, great deli, veggies and customer service is awesome!

My husband and I went to Aladdin's today for the first time and we LOVED IT!!!! We started with the eggplant dip/pita (I can't remember what it's called) and OMG, sooooo good. I  ordered the gyro wrap/salad and my husband ordered the chicken shwarma wrap as our main course, very delicious.  We love hole in the wall places and unlike others, we enjoy good food - served on china or paper plates. It's all about the food, right?  We will be back again (probably tomorrow).  I recommend this place highly!

I've been here twice. I had a pedicure with my friend and it was nice, good experience. The only reason why I am giving PN's two stars is when I went back to get gels done on my finger nails they did it all wrong and they started chipping the next day and peeling off within 3-4 days. It was awful. I've had gels on my nails plenty time to know that they last awhile but sadly they peeled off within the week. Sigh. I probably will not go back and stick with the original place I go to.  Also, another thing that bothers me is when they ask you to pay before your visit is over and they COUNT their tip right in front of you, it's so awkward. I tip 20% on the visits and I feel like they want to make sure they are making money, which I understand but right in front of you? Awkward.

I've worked for Chiropractors pretty much all my life....then got married and had kids.....my body failing me until I came here. As a wife, mother and Zumba Fitness Instructor, I needed a great Dr. to work out my body and Dr. Dave is AWESOME. He's such a cool guy and knows what he's doing. Both my children go see him as well. Love his staff too. Very relaxed and professional office. If you're looking for a wonderful Chiropractor, go to Thompson Peak Chiropractic NOW!

We live super close to this restaurant but rarely dine here. Prices are a little high and when you have kids, it get expensive. Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious and I suggest you trying it if you're visiting the area. With the amount of Mexican restaurants, Id rather visit somewhere else where the prices are affordable.

Great menu!!! Lots of food. The prime rib, ribs, catfish, side salads, shrimp cargo- ALL DELISH! What I also like about Charlestons are the children's menu, very reasonable and they give a lot of food for the price. We love this place!! Waiters are also really nice and work hard for their tips!

My husband is from North Carolina where they sell Cherrywine. We searched all over AZ to purchase some, never found any. Bought a 12 pack online and shipping alone was 20 bucks. Apparently he really wanted this soda. Anyway, we found this shop and they carry Cherrywine!!!! Bought a case this morning. Love this place and we will be back.

I don't shop at Safeway much but when I do go there for a specific item, I always enjoy going into their store. Clean. The deli counter peeps seem to be really nice. Managers are a hoot.   Like I said before, I don't shop Safeway often but I do like this one when I need a specific item.

Just go to Walgreens for deals. Pharmacy is o.k. - could be better, especially when your husband has diabetes and you NEED supplies. Front cashier, older lady, was AWFUL! You leave the store in a good mood but in order to check out you HAD to hear about how awful EVERY customer that has walked in that store was that day.  I go to Walgreens only for one or two things since its so close, otherwise I would go to CVS if it was closer.

The BEST meatball sandwiches EVER!!!! Service is the BOMB!!! I love the new owners of the Grocery Station and P.S. They are NOT closed!!! They just have new owners and they are the nicest guys, EVER!  If you want to use your debit card, it's a $3 min, can't blame them there. Awesome deli. Clean and friendly. I love this place!! My kids love the cotton candy they sell there as well.

Last night I met up with some good friends of mine here at AZ 88 and we were so delighted about the entire experience. I usually rave about the food first but I'm going to RAVE about our server for the evening, Rebecca. She was probably the nicest, kindest and professional server I've ever had in my entire life. From start to finish she was on top of EVERYTHING. We never had a half full glass of water and never had to ask for anything because she knew EXACTLY what we needed. By far, hands down the BEST service I've had. If you go to AZ 88, ask for Rebecca, you will NOT be disappointed.  Now, the food! Shrimp ceviche was absolutely amazing as an appetizer as was the dipping ries with all the amazing sauces you get with it. Must try appetizers for sure. The bonfire chicken dish was amazing, so full of flavor and the chicken was so tender and melts in your mouth. Cheeseburgers are WONDERFUL, the meat is so tender and once again, tons of flavor, however, I wish it was served on a better bun.   A very chic, romantic and modern place. You MUST try AZ 88 and don't forget to have Rebecca as your server!

I gave it 5 stars because from start to finish it was an excellent experience. We ordered the lobster dip, SO GOOD and the egg rolls to start off with. Shared the lobster hamburger, to die for. Beers were delish, I believe I got the Blue Moon and some sort of pomegranate beer. YUM! For dessert we ordered the brownie and ice-cream YUM~ I will be back. Our waitress was AWESOME!

Came here after a doctors appointment at St. Joes. We came around 11ish. Just a few peeps in the restaurant. The atmosphere was great, LOTS of decor but I was really in awe of the menu. Looked great! Prices were decent. I was told to get the Cowboy burger because it was "really" good, eh, I've had better. It literally crumbled in my hands, maybe too much sauce? I don't know but with the use of a napkin, LOTS of them, I was able to eat it, come on, I was hungry. I do have to say the the french fries SUCK. Seriously. Don't give me half cooked fries. They weren't even crispy. It was gross to be honest with you and reading other reviews, looks like I'm not the only one who thinks they should work on their french fries.  The ONLY reason why I won't come back here is because we came in early, I witnessed them cooking a ton of burgers and putting them in a dish - waiting for the "lunch crowd" to come in. That isn't fresh LENNY! How long are those cooked burgers going to sit there? Kinda not my thing.

Ok. Just ordered dinner to go and it was ALL wrong!  Spent $12 on a curry chicken and there was tiny little pieces of thinned out chicken, total waste of money, seriously, there was NO chicken in this dish. I am SO disappointed. We also ordered Thai toast only to get some fried corn patty. It also seems they increased their prices. We did call and the lady who answered said that I ordered these corn patties and I said, "I have no idea what these corn patties are let alone the name of it to order it". Uggg.   I'd rather go to Thai House which is further away to get Thai food - their portions are well worth the money there.  Sorry Osha!

OH MY GOODNESS!!!! My little sister told me about Sala Thai and I've been here 4 times in less than 10 days, YUP, it's THAT GOOD! I order the drunken noodles, YUMMY as well as the crab pulls, egg rolls with chicken, pad thai, fried rice and a taro boba. I love how sweet everyone is there. Atmosphere is darling and the restaurant, though found in a retail strip, YOU WANT TO GO HERE!!!! Perfect for kids too, especially if you sit by their super duper cool fish tank. We drive from North Scottsdale to Sala Thai to get the best Thai food we have found in the good ol' State of Arizona.

Five stars from us because we just LOVED IT!!!! We ordered the orange chicken as many recommended it and boy did we enjoy every single bite of it, it was gone, none to take home as leftovers. We also got the egg fried rice, lo mein noodles and the triple delight, all so delish!   Waitress and entire staff were so friendly. Just a great place to go OR PICK UP to take home!  I really, highly recommend this little jewel.  We will FOR SURE be back!!!

Came here for lunch today and the place was dead. We should have left but we decided to stay for lunch because we were starving. I have to say that Cafepino wasn't the first place we wanted to eat at today, we went to TeaLight Cafe but had to leave because it was PACKED OUT and there were no tables, hence our decision to eat at Cafepino. We sat down only to realize how expensive this place is!!! Holy cow, I mean come on, not even a "lunch special menu." I can't imagine spending $15 for pasta at lunch time. We did order a pizza which was good, we shared.  This place has potential if they offered LUNCH SPECIALS! There are tons of office buildlings across the way and I can't imagine why this restaurant shouldn't be packed out at 12:30 on a business day.  And we should have checked the price on the old ice tea they served, $3.00, YIKES.  Kids menu was priced high too, $7 starting.  We will not be back, sorry.

I've been to Stacy's a few times, usually it's to go. Hole in the wall place, bring cash. Stacy's opens at 11, literally, they are still getting the restaurant up and running at 11 - I had to wait until they were ready, awkward. But anyway, the food was great. Pulled pork, rice and beans, fried okra, onion rings and red velvet cake. Thankfully I checked my order before I left because they forgot to put the cake in the bag.   My only suggestion is that they do a better job at "to go" bagging. Seems like they kinda threw it in one little paper bag. Other than that, at least try it out.   I heard from Stacy that they are trying to open up a new location off Shea and Scottsdale Road which is SWEET!!!!

We love the Thai House, the food is great. As many of the past reviews mentioned. I don't care for spicy food at all so whenever I order the red cury (delish) I always get a ZERO because it still comes out with spice, so rate low if you don't want too much of a mouth burn.  The only thing I was disappointed about was when my little boy wanted regular fried rice, no veggies, no meat, just rice and the soy sauce and they charged us $8.00 - would have thought it would be less.  Other than that, everything is pretty good.  The lunch combos are good but the salad that it comes with needs to be worked on. I suggest the soup.  Fast and delish!

My family and I love this little joint. The orange chicken is OUT OF THIS WORLD as well as the Garlic Sauce with Chicken. Tonight we tried the orange shrimp and we once again were delighted. The shrimp were big and plentiful.  Whenever we want to eat out, we always go here or pick up. I recommend going to the restaurant to order food because they will cook it fast and fresh!  Great sushi as well.

Last time I went there, I did a pickup order. I was overcharged $10 and when I went back to show the older lady the mistake she made, she never apologized and was very, VERY rude. Even after being treated badly, I asked to talk to a manager and she looked at me and said, "I am the manager". It was horrible. Because of her and her attitude, I would never go back.   It's too bad because the food is decent.

Went here for lunch today and it was good! The sour dough bread they give you prior to your meal is phenomenal!  I ordered the Campanelle Carbonara and it was delish! Enough to share, especially if you order it for lunch. The Campanelle Carbonara had chicken, crispy bacon and spinach in it, YUMMY!  The only thing I would change on my end was the friend who I had lunch with, that's about all. :)

I love their iced lattes. The only thing I ask is that they add more "ICE" to the lattes. Just a few cubes won't cut it, taste like a room temperature drink rather than something refreshing. Then again, it's only one person who makes the drinks terrible there. Everyone else is FANTASTIC!

I totally love this place. First time we went, awesome service, great food! Second time we went, TERRIBLE service. It was horrible. Waitress asked us if we wanted tarter sauce for our fish, we said yes, and she never brought it and when my husband had to walk to the back counter, we FINALLY received it. She then came to us and asked us if "another girl" apologized for not bringing it. I hate when people place blame on others. I'll go back but I hope we don't get the same waitress!

Loved it, thought it was great. Been to both the Phx and Scottsdale location.  I've read that some peeps didn't like the long line but they do make all sandwiches fresh....I didn't mind the wait (even with 2 small kids in tow). Bread and pastrami was delish. The service was fine - we went on  a Sunday, so it was rather slow...so maybe that was why we got such great service? Who knows. All I know is that we'll be back! :0)

I tried Amore's Pizza and Wings and I enjoyed it. Perfect little spot for lunch or a quick dinner with the kids. I haven't yet had the pizza but we are a huge fan of their meatball subs. Delish.  The chocolate cake is also good once it hits room temperature. Yummy.

She was professional, took her time and educated me more about my hair than any other stylist I have been to.   The staff is very friendly and I WILL be back.  I highly recommend Indulge Yourself Salon!!!!  Five Stars ALL THE WAY!

My husband is from North Carolina (there obviously is no comparison to their bbq). BD's was pretty good, sorta pricy and their menu is a little confusing (written on chalk board). Enough of that.....on to the food.  TRY THE MAC AND CHEESE! So good! Also the sweet potato fries, YUMMY! Pulled pork plate is great too!   I ordered the brisket, it was good but had a lot of fat in it......so I ate more of the pulled pork my son was eating. Potato salad is so yummy too. They could work on giving bigger sized corn bread.  I would go  back!

My sister LOVES Someburros so today while shopping, I decided to stop by for some Mexican food "to-go". It was day 2 since their grand opening but since I heard so much about it, I had to go. The line was obviously long, but worth it. Food was great. I ordered the chicken fundido which came with rice and it was only $5 (it wa their special for the day). Had to pay an extra $1.50 for chips (boo). Ordered a cheese burger for my son, it was large and in charge. I would for sure go back....  The only gripe is that people who are waiting for food "to go" kinda lingers around the front because there really isn't anywhere for us to go and wait without taking up table space for people eating at the restaurant.

Truly, as good as it gets! The food is so fresh and so delish! I'm a gal who likes to eat but eventually I decided to try True Food Kitchen and boy am I glad I did. I ordered the quinoa burger (though there is no meat in it) and it was to DIE FOR!!!!!! I left feeling happy and not that "OH MY GOD, why did I eat that meal" kind of feeling.  It gets busy so get there early or go on an off time, especially if you don't like to wait.   The restaurant in itself is JUST SO BEAUTIFUL!  Ask for the server Brandon if you go!!!!

Great food! Nice portions. Featured on the FOOD NETWORK! I work just a few doors down at Studio North Yoga & Dance and it's always a treat to stop by the Perk for a bite to eat. Reuben sandwich was delish! Also had pancakes there too. Just a great neighborhood joint that you have to try at least once, or twice or make it a habit like me and go there all the time!!!

If you have children, DO NOT  bring them here. I asked to sit inside with my baby and was told by our waitress that "we would clutter" the area, NO LIE! I would have left but was meeting my best friend and son for lunch. Sat outside, ordered some apps and waited, waited, waited, oh did I mention waited for our waitress to come back to take our lunch order? It was horrible!!!!   We waited so long for her to take our order that when we did get our food, I asked for the bill and a to-go box. Oddly enough, when we were done eating, she brought us the bill and box- again, confirming how long you must wait.   The food was good. Tasted fresh but what really ruined lunch for us was the blonde waitress we had. She needs to learn to smile and actually WORK for her tip. Felt like she was doing us a favor by bringing us our food.   I called my husband and I told him that though I enjoyed my company, I very much disliked the service.  I will not be back.

What can I say? They were either out of yogurt or the flavors they were featuring was TRULY FUNKY. Not a place I would ever bring my kids again to. Sigh. I've had better. Sigh.

I love taking my kids here. Perfect place for them to play and exercise without knowing they are exercising. Supporters if Phoenix Children's Hospital, discounts for kids with physical issues, such as my daughter. If you haven't been, bring your kids and enjoy! They will love it.   Snack bar is awesome too!!!

My husband and I fell in love all over again at Dominicks! O.k., joking! We spent an evening, just us too basking in the wonderful atmosphere of Dominicks Steakhouse. I ordered the Ribeye and it melted in my mouth. The fried meatballs were good but I wouldn't order it again. The shrimp appetizer was amazing, the sauce was FANTASTIC! Service was awesome too but the steaks, OMG, so tender and full of flavor.  It's expensive. Our bill was $250 but it was a date night and we really needed to treat ourselves!!!  Oh and try the Italian Blood Martinis, HELLO BABY!!!! Order one because they give you the shaker and whats left in the shaker is the amount of another martini. Yeah baby!  We plan on going back for our anniversary.

Whenever we go to this DD location they are always out of jelly donuts. Explain that to two kids, in a mini-van while listening to Dirty Bit by the Black Eye Peas at my kids request. This problem equals disaster.     Please, make more Jelly Donuts!  UPDATE: I went to DD because I was desperate for an iced coffee. My little 3 year old girl wanted Jelly Donuts in the Munchkin order and guess what, NO JELLY DONUTS! OWNERS if you read this, YOU OWE ME SOME JELLY MUNCHKINS!! I mean, come on, I went in the morning!!!!

At first I wasn't too sure if I wanted to eat at this place because the thought of sushi working it's way around a room sorta freaked me out but then one day, I decided to do it and I AM SO HAPPY I DID! I love this place and my kids love it even more!!! Beautiful selection of sushi and NOW you can finally sample different sushi at a low cost!! We loved it so much the first time we went again the next day and we will be back!!!!! Try this place, it's fun, easy and delish!

GO! GO! GO! GO! RUN!!!!! Run to CK Performance!!!!!! First of all, the staff is SOOOOO friendly and you feel welcomed from the moment you walk in until the moment you walk out. The clothes are SO cute, comfortable and reasonable in prices. It's not all about workout gear either, they sell some of the cutest tops I've seen and OH SO COMFORTABLE!   If you purchase an item that is too long, guess what?? They offer FREE alterations!!!! You can't go wrong. If you're in the fitness industry like myself (I'm a Zumba Fitness Instructor) or if you're getting back to the gym or just want some super stylish and comfy clothes, you gotta get yourself to CK Performance.  If you're an instructor, ask about the instructor discount.  I've sent my students from Studio North Yoga & Dance to CK Performance and they all LOVE this place!!!!

I have to say that I've been to plenty of Smashburgers so I knew what to expect when I visited this location. Sadly, my family and I were really disappointed. First, we went to get our drinks while they cooked our food and the drink station was filthy. Not just dirty but FILTHY. Trash, dried soda and, here is the kicked, HAIR!!!!!!!! It was disgusting. I told an employee they may want to clean up the station in a kind manner but he was more annoyed than anything.  Food was good but the chicken strips was a chicken breast cut into two pieces and deep fried, my daughter wouldn't touch it. Smash fries had NO seasoning on it and yes, we did ask if we got the right fries, they said yes.   It was just a really bad experience and I hope if you read this Smashburger, you make sure to keep the drink station area clean and hair free.

We received information that Gina's Homemade was just right around the corner from our house so we decided to place an order to go. We ordered the lasagna and the Pop's pizza. My husband told me it's not a "sit down" restaurant, more like a place to buy food, GOOD food to take home.  I have to say that this is some of the best food we've had, especially in an area where everywhere you go it's all food chains. The lasagna is UNBELIEVABLE. You have to try it. We ordered the single serving lasagna and we wished we ordered more. I can't express how delish it was. The Pop's pizza was also so delish.   If you haven't tried this place, order food and take it home, you truly won't be disappointed.  I plan on picking up more lasagna today!!!!!

Didn't know what all the fuss was about until I went here for a later dinner with my family. It's delish! I shared a hotdog as well as the Italian Beef with peppers on the side. OH MY WORD. It hit the spot. You have to try the Strawberry Shortcake too!!  It's amazing and probably the best I've had (outside of our home.) It's worth the wait. Cook to serve. Relaxed but a tad, o.k., super LOUD!

Don't let the menu or the name of the restaurant fool you, the SALTY SOW is OFF THE HOOK!!!!!! Comfort food at it's best! I suggest ordering a few dishes and sharing, it's that good. The pork ragu with polenta is AMAZING!!! So are the tacos and the french fries. I can go on and on and on!!!!!  I don't suggest bringing your little kids here, especially if they are picky eaters. I do suggest coming here for a date with your better half. Live music on the patio as well.  AWESOME! AWESOME AWESOME!

My little sister and I went to get our nails done on Saturday and we had a very nice experience at Super 7 Nails. Tina did my gels manicure as well as my pedicure. I did the Euro Pedi and I wanted the extras. It was worth it. I liked also how they use a liner for each pedicure so that you know your feet is going into CLEAN water. They throw away the plastic liner once your pedicure is over. I do recommend this place as everyone was friendly and the prices are fair. For a gel manicure just across the street it was 42 bucks, here it's only 25, or in the area. They have been at this location for less than a year. Try it!

Beautiful studio, amazing instructors. Everyone is so friendly. Wonderful neighborhood yoga/fitness facility without that gym feeling. Great place to get in shape, meet new friends and learn how you can keep healthy! I highly recommend Studio North Yoga & Dance! Zumba Fitness classes are a MUST!

Stumbled into this little mom and pop shop and BOY oh BOY were we glad we did. The owner was SO friendly and answered all our questions. My husband ordered a hotdog (he forgot the name - it had slaw and thousand island dressing on it)  he LOVED IT!!!! The bread was so soft and delish. The owner of Hometown dogs also won a competition for her salsa and gave our group a sample and OH MY GOODNESS, we were in HEAVEN!!!!!!!  If you're looking for a dog at decent prices and you want your taste buds to be AWAKEN, then you MUST stop here!!!!!!!  I highly recommend Hometown Dogs!!!! Can't wait to come again when we visit Fountain Hills!

SO EXCITED to have Pita Jungle so close to our home! Yipee!!!!! If you haven't been OR you have been and you haven't had the  "Caramelized Cauliflower with Tahini", YOU MUST ORDER THIS!!! It's a great appetizer and easily shared amongst two people. I love the chicken tiki masala as well, YUMMERS!!!!   Of course this location is pretty new so they have "things" to work on but stop by and give them a try!

PLEASE MANAGEMENT, work on making sure that food is delivered in a timely manner. Having to wait for dinner with kids is not fun as much as we love our children.  We ordered the mac and cheese balls, they were really good. So was the bean soup (very tasty) however, here comes the bad news. The Cesar salad was awful, it came with dressing on it however it seemed so dry. I asked for extra dressing, I was given an ounce of dressing, not enough to make a difference in the taste. The chicken in it was dry and was cut into big chunks, wasn't sure if i was eating the croutons of chicken. Maybe slice the chicken instead of chopping them up in big bite size pieces? Also, please when you deliver food to a table, make sure you give your customers forks and spoons. Please? Having to wait to eat your salad because you are not given forks, SUCKS.    My mom ordered the kale salad was good but was over charged by 3 dollars when we received the bill. Bummer. Glad we caught it.  Burgers were too salty, the kids ate the fries, not the burgers. Waste of food.  Kids mac and cheese is da bomb. Yes, I ate off my daughters plate because my salad was yucky.  My sister ordered a pizza but it looked under cooked, blah. I didn't even want to try it.  Desserts are wonderful!!! Cheesecake is amazing as is the bread pudding.  Please work on cleaning up the menu! This place can be a great neighborhood joint but your restaurant decor is FOR SURE is outshining your food.  Will I come back? Probably not......not until I see Yelp reviews stating the places has changed for the better.  I hate these kind of reviews but someone needs to tell Modern Grove that their food isn't so "modern" at this point. Could have cooked it at home kind of meal.  Our waiter was AWESOME though!!!!!! I forgot his name but he did great.

Wow!!!! This place is a gem!!! The food is unbelievable!!! Cozy and friendly staff. Dined here with a few friends and I was blown away at the service and the food. The appetizers were amazing, particularly the Coxinha!!! Wow!!!! Melts in your mouth. We also ordered the Bolinho de bacalhau and for a meal the feijoada. All amazing!!! If you want something different, come visit this restaurant. You won't be disappointed.

I miss the Albertsons!!! WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!!! I've had to run there one or twice to get milk only to walk into an EMPTY grocery story! All the employees who use to work at Albertsons who now work at Haggens are truly so special. Steve, Lydia, everyone! I feel bad that they have to deal with an over priced store that really has NO "special" features. I know so many families who use to shop at Albertsons but now have moved on to Fry's or to Safeway across the street. We moved over to Safeway which is now busy like CRAZY!!!!  Bottom line, families DO NOT want to pay for items we know we can get for cheaper across the street at Safeway. If we want organic, we go to Sprouts less then 3 miles away.  Haggen's not sure why you decided to do this but seeing the EMPTY store shows that you are doing something VERY wrong!!!!
