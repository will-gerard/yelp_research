I actually live by their other location on Cave Creek, but I called to get a badly needed bike fitting on my road bike, they recomended me to this location. The shop is small, but has everything you need. My fitting lasted about an hour. It seriously has changed the way I ride. Jeff was just epic! Not only did he take the measurements and fit me, but he gave me great recomendations to get the most out of my ride, including fixing my pedal stroke. Even though I went at the shop's busy time, I felt like the only one in the store. Their prices were very reasonable and were not pushy on sales. He made recomendations based on my needs. I am still a novice to cycling, but thanks to Jeff I learned more in one hour than the past year of riding. They have a customer for life.

I take my car here every 3,000 miles for oil changes only. These guys will try to sell you everything you don't need for your car so be careful! I just print out my discount coupon, get my oil change and say thanks but no thanks to their list of suggestions i need to do to make my car safe. They will try to sell you things like fuel injection cleaner for $100($10 at O'Reilly), tell you your brake fluid is dirty by showing you a strip, same goes for power steering, and rear differential(DON'T DO IT! Total Scam.) If your car has under 150k miles, you have nothing to worry about. Those parts are sealed.If they tell you need a air filter or cabin filter, save the money and go down the street to O'Reilly (and no I don't work for O'Relly)

After reading reviews on here, I was hesitant to stay, but decided to check it out. We stayed on a Thursday night and I decided to bump up to a Player Suite, which was not that much more expensive than the regular room. I was pleasantly surprised! The room was very nice, had a flat screen TV. The room is in the regular style building so no worries about the crazy slant affect. We didn't have bath towels in our room, but after a phone call, housekeeping had them up in 5 minutes. The bed was really comfortable! It was a pillowtop mattress, we loved it. We were hit up a few times by sales people on the floor, we just ignored them. No hassles there. The place does show its age, but for the $ saved it was a great time! I would stay there again.

I love Cirque du Soleil shows. I have seen just about every traveling show and Mystere in Vegas. This was a very unique show. It was almost like sensory overload!  We left the show saying WOW! Our seats were 10 rows from the front and you could feel the fire from the stage! We had actors standing right next to us. One even was sitting on top our seat during the show! The stage is amazing and worth seeing just for what it can do.

My girlfriend and I visited Yellowtail this past weekend. This was my second visit and her first. We both LOVE this place! Chef Akira and his team have created an incredible menu that is pretty unique and you would be hard pressed to find anything else like it. The portions may be a little small, but they are packed with flavor and make you want more!  The Thai snapper was amazing along with some Hawaiian fish we had. Well worth the price. Can't wait to go back again! I love the view of the fountains as well. Great ambience!

I really wanted to give this place 5 stars. The food was really good. My fiance and I ordered organic soda(Yum!), had a pizza with regular thick crust and the baked wings which were really great! I am excited to try more menu options. We happened to come around closing on a Thursday night, and the service was just horrible. Being a server in my past, I know people have off nights, so I will let this one slide. I plan to go back, the menu now that is organic and fresh just seems great! I am excited more restaurants in town are going in the organic, fresh direction.

I LOVE Grayhawk Yoga. I try to go twice a week. I just started doing yoga about 6 months ago. My favorite teachers are Adam(who sings and plays guitar to you during shavasana and Jenni who makes sure you actually work your body. I always leave feeling amazing!

I had heard some good things about this place for sometime and wanted to try it out. My girlfriend and I went here on a Wednesday night. The ambience is nice when you walk in. Has a nice water feature in the middle of the restaurant. We noticed the place was absolutely dead. There was one other couple there at 8pm. We wondered why it was so empty. We would find out once we started eating. We started with the sugar cane shrimp which was pretty good. It was unique. For entrees we ordered Pad Thai and Pad Panang Neau Gai. The entrees were just horrible! I love Pad Thai and eat it any chance I get. Their version of Pad Thai had some horrific flavoring, honestly tasted like Chef Boy R De sauce was used. The Pad Panang dish was just a trainwreck! It had chicken, peppers, coconut milk sauce and some kind of spice..It seriously tasted like the smell of dish detergent. My girlfriend and I love Thai food, but this had to be one of the worst meals we both have ever had. The server didn't seem to care although she did take the trainwreck dish off our bill. We left as soon as we could. No wonder why this place was empty.

I am a Perk fan! I have eaten here at least once a week for the past two months and have not been dissapointed.   For Breakfast you can't go wrong with with pancakes, simply amazing. My fiance loved the Fancy Pants Scramble. For those that love Brie Cheese, this one is for you.  For lunch, the best item is the grass fed beef burger with sweet potato fries. Great tasting burger and the fries are just awesome. I love the fact that they support local farmers and order grass fed beef. That is hard to find in this town, but I would gladly support any business that goes the extra mile for better ingredients. Add the always great service and this local joint a winner. If they started serving dinner, I would probably never leave.

The first time we went, the place had been opened for a week. Food was average. Nice neighborhood joint. We had a server that was clueless and ruined the experience for us. I gave them some slack because it was opening week, but the server had no idea of the beers they served. We decided to give them another shot a month later, the service was great, but the food was still not that great. For some reason they season the food with quite a bit of salt in everything, which really ruins the flavor. We tried two pizzas which came out undercooked and the lasagna which was ok minus the insane amount of salt and being burnt on the bottom. Great ambience for a drink, but the pizzas, pastas are not that great.

I had heavily soiled carpets from two years of neglect. Al came out and made them like new and his pricing did not break the bank. He was on time and very professional. I would definitely use him again.
