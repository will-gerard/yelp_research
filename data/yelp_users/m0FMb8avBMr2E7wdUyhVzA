Joes actually surprised me. I've been there once probably 10 years ago, since I live in the far east valley, I don't make the journey very much. Stopped into support my friends band, arrived early and sat at the bar.  Joe....super friendly, personalble and very chatty as I waited for my friends band to start. Bartender gets an A++ Great personal service and I watched her deal with a couple of disgruntled customers about free refills on soda and see handled those boys like a champ. You better keep that one Joe!  Set up is your typical live music venue, sound was GREAT, nice big stage. Cool place, I only wished i lived a bit closer.

Stopped in here, had an hour to kill before a concert near by with my daughter.  Great little local pizza place, not overly busy for a Sunday night, football on the TV's, B-day party at the table next to us, local drunks at the bar......  Ordered the Great White pizza with ranch, and it was great. Good selection of beer on tap. I really liked this place, too bad we live 45 miles away.  Our waitress was outstanding!!  I almost got carded!!

Best Asian food place to eat. They will totally customize your meal for you. Orange chicken? no breading? No problem. How ever you want your meal, they will make it that way. I orderedKung Pao Chicken....extra extra extra extra spicy.......Well it wasn't enough, had to head to the chili bar to spice it up even more.......THUMBS UP!!

I like this theatre because it's NEVER packed when I'm here. Even seeing the Avengers 2 on opening weekend it wasn't very packed. I don't know what's wrong with this location, but I love an unpacked AMC. I will always come here before a Harkins. Pricing complaints? IDK.......it's average to me.

I've dropped my kids off here for parties, have never gone in, until this past time.  HOLY BALLS, it's a loud kid haven. Complete chaos. My kids always have fun here, pretty pricey if it wasn't for a party though. They had a small little arcade with 15-20 ticket games.......hate it.

I have passed this location at least 100 times in the past 4 years, always have seen the neon beer signs in the window and thought to myself......"odd place for a bar."  I finally stopped this weekend.   If you like DIVE BARS this is your place.....Sunday fun day is in full effect now! Beer selection could be better but the greasy burgers coming off the grill where perfect!!!!  Juke Box, pool tables, darts and a whole bar full of old men that look like they've been coming there for 50 years.  The one waitress they had day was nothing short of Super Woman......all by herself and carried a great attitude the whole time.....SHE"S A KEEPER!!!!  AND SUPER CHEAP!!   PUB N GRUB-------I AM A FAN!!!!!

What happened? What happened to this east valley landmark? I think it's gone downhill. Four of us sat at a table and none of us were impressed by anything.  I had the most bland fajita's ever. I could feel a cold coming on so I asked for jalepeno's or habenero's or anything to spice it up.......I got nothing.  Servers were attentive and dessert was good, but I can't say anything positive about the main courses. I doubt I will make it back.

I am a huge fan of Pesto's. Local business owners that have it right. Small intimate restaurant, great happy hour EVERY DAY from 12-6, and a terrific staff. This is the Italian place YOU need to support. Food is outstanding and an awesome wine list, if you stop you MUST order the bacon wrap dates. I would would work here and you could pay me each week in dates. If I was a waiter here, overtime I delivered a plate of those, I would guarantee one would make its way into my mouth overtime. This is the perfect first date place.

Nothing me feels more secure with shopping here than the asian sales associate telling me as I look through the racks.....  "Just to let you know your size XL and XXL are all in the back."  F U lady!!!  I don't need no XL or XXL.  I have avoided Buckle for awhile now, just because I hate how pushy the sales people are. Last time I was in there I was trying on jeans and the sales guy was throwing shoes under the door and throwing shirts over the door........too pushy.  Now I have some sales lady, telling me that I need a XL or XXL?  I'm 190lbs.......I wear a 36/32 jean!!!  Sorry sir, all the fat clothes are in the back, we don't put them in our store front.  If you could waddle outside to our changing tent, we'll bring some out to you.   Buckle, and to you lady............G T H!!!

Best happy hour in the valley and always busy! We come strictly for the awesome happy hour food and my girl loves the $5 cosmos. I wish they would put some type of IPA on draft.  Now I've been here 10-20 times and the only complaint I will give is 9/10 the bartenders look completely disgruntled. They act like they hate the happy hour crowd. Both bartenders with a sour look on their face and it ABSOLUTELY KILLS THEM to ask us if we would like food or another drink. The asian girl behind the bar has ZERO personality. ZERO. This is why 4 stars instead of 5.   I will always return for the happy hour food, if you were to take that away, I would have no reason to come in here. Never have eaten lunch or dinner here.

A Gilbert staple. I personally love the asada breakfast burrito. Total goodness.  BUT.....after the last stop here, here's what I noticed.  ONE EMPLOYEE, she took my order and went back herself and made my burrito and this time it was tiny, not my usual plump fat burrito. Hmmmm......hope I caught it on an off day.

Went to see a friends band on a Saturday......Music was good, bartenders were good, pretty divey bar all in all. Super dark parking lot and shady customers hanging out side. Im a big guy so the people didn't bother me, but it would be questionable for single ladies to go.

This kohls is just like the one on Baseline and Cooper. A FREEKING DUMP. Ross has more organization than this corperate store.  The whole mens section is a total wreck.   NOTE:::::: the only decent Kohls in the east valley is on 202/Country Club.  This workers and management is this place should be ashamed of themselves.

I've usually had good experiences here, 90% of the time. Last time they fell on their face for me. When I dropped off my proof to be printed, they said "We'll have a proof tomorrow for you".......annnnnddddddd.......a week later after I had to call I finally call for it. In my panic to have my print as quick as I could get it, my friend recommended a website that I can print for $8 and take it to a competitor and print for $1.30. Well, everything I print now will be online, sorry A.G.......it's that one little customer service slip up that makes you lose business.

YEAH CORPERATE AMERICA. Lame in every sense of the word. Great for sporting events on TV, thats it. I always support the local business when I have too. I went to watch the NCAA championship at HOB but some how they lost their liquor license. WTF? I had a beer and got out of there as fast as I could. I rather eat cheerios at home.

Stopped here on our way back from Prescott Sunday morning. Let me say I was GREATLY surprised with this place. Service and friendliness was top notch, and our breakfast was OUTSTANDING.  I got the springs scramble, loaded omelette  with country gravy on top.....SO GOOD!! They must of put a pound of potatoes on my place that I barely put a dent in, but still good. They also had the BEST home made ghost pepper hot sauce on the table, also for sale. Took home 2 bottles!!  Love this place and we'll be back!!!!

My wife and I were in the mood for some country music tonight, so Roosters was our pick. First timers for us. We were definitely the youngest people in the bar. When I read it was biker friendly my first thought was "my people"........BUT it was like a retirement home in there. Not our age group by 30 years. BUT.......service was good, band was great, and drinks were reasonable.

This is a cool ass little place, how have I never seen this? Lived in AZ since the 80's, never been a Scottsdale fan. But after a hike on Camelback today, my girl wanted to continue our afternoon. She used to come here in high school. I wish I was hungry, but we just had a couple of cocktails and enjoyed the 2nd level patio and people watched. Charming staff as well. I look forward to coming back here soon, the menu looked great!!!

Love the goofy golf here, most of it in the shade when you play. They have a few different courses you can play. Always fun family time. The only think I didn't like was the constant traffic of people walking by when you play from the waterpark. Otherwise we love it.

Stopped in here for some grub before we caught some bands across the street.....very cool little vegan place. I had a vegan big mac (looked just like the real thing) and some meatless chicken wings!  Not my normal way of eating, but it was great!! Pretty Hipster vegan place, I liked it a lot!!

Curiosity was killing us so we had to see what John Taffer did to BSB. Not much. It's brighter inside, not so dark and gloomy, but really the same exact place. A few new tables, same bar layout. Didn't try any food, but the beer out of the tap was warm. I love goose island beer, and when I took that first sip, ehhhh.......ruins it.

Clearly the best DQ in the area. Newly updated fresh and clean. The staff is young and polite, nice to see they are trained correctly for high school students. Even when it's crazy packed on a Friday night and people are rude at the counter, I noticed Maya (Mya?) held it together behind the counter as a customer complained about his chicken strips being double stripped. What ever that means. I ordered 4 blizzards and mine came out fine.

FIRST TIMERS here. We received a gift certificate for X-mas and decided to use it on V-day. It's down town Phx, you have to park in the back, beautiful paint on the outside wall as you come in. Great street side presentation. The inside is not much to write about, but the food speaks VOLUMES.  Michalita is what we started with, spicy bloody mary mix and a beer mixed in. Never had one, I think I will start drinking them every hangover now.....they were that good. Started with the ELOTE buttered corn, cilantro, oxoana cheese and spicy cream on top.....blew my mind. I could eat an entire bucket of this. I had the Suizas enchiladas.....again.  Awesome.......best I've ever had. My wife had the Taco's de conchinita pibil tacos........she loved every bite of it!!  I really like how they didn't throw down a bowl of tortilla chips and salsa on the table instead, it was warm bread and an olive tapenade.  As we walked out, you know why all the praise this place gets. It's a great Phoenix staple. A must stop.

Love Love Love Carley's. This is my second time here, I came back for the same bloody mary I had last time........and they nailed it. Bloody Mary's can be hit or miss (mostly a miss) but Carley's is perfect overtime. Nice little bistro in downtown, nice patio on the sidewalk. I had the cuban sandwich and it was great. A must stop in downtown Phx!!!!

First of all I'm not a giant fan of corporate beer houses in a mall. BUT, I met a long time friend here for a couple drinks on a Wed night so here I am.  Didn't order food......The amount of taps they had was pretty outstanding. I usually jump from beer to beer, but they had Dogfish Head 90 minute on tap, so I stuck with that.  My friend, a die hard Jager drinker, orders doubles at a time, my girl, martini's.  Now being we are drinkers, and not cheap drinkers either you would think our table would get a bit more attention from our waitress in a empty restaurant on a Wed night.  NO.....we had to flag her down EVERY TIME to get a drink, many times her walking right past our table. We weren't a bunch of obnoxious frat boys.....3 people having expensive cocktails catching up.  We had to FLAG her down to get water as well.......pfffffftttt.   I had my rating at 3 stars but after reading this I knocked it down a star because I'm ticked off again because of our experience.

LOVE LOVE LOVE  this place. Stopped in on a Saturday before bowling next door the whole entire staff was INCREDIBLE!! 2 gyro's for me and my daughter and my son just wanted french fries. The lady behind the counter came out to chat with us......."NO GYRO FOR YOU?" she went back and got him a little plate of meat to try......totally awesome. So I made a mental note to check in on Yelp and BOOM.....50% off your 2nd item......BONUS!!!!! I love this place even more now. We stopped in for a quick lunch and CANT WAIT to come back for a full dinner.   Phoenicia great job.....We're big fans now....see you soon!!!

Huge fan of the Egg, I use to live next to the one on Baseline. Points for the waitress filling our coffee cup 3/4 full so we have room for cream. Negative points for giving us the check half way through our breakfast, I feel like your kicking us out.....I hate that.   The food is always great, I've never had a complaint the 100 times I've eaten at US Egg.

YEAH SUMMER SPECIALS!!   $124 for the night, waterpark and breakfast!! Great deal for a family of 4. Pretty slam packed on Saturday afternoon but Sunday afternoon the place was deserted. Tapatio Cliffs has everything going for it, except the parking situation is down right impossible. Park your car if you get a decent spot and LEAVE IT THERE. We had to park at Different Point of View and hike up to get it Sunday morning.  Valet it, or leave it in your good spot. We had a wonderful time, I'd like to come back before the summer is over.

Well, after finding a buy one get one coupon I decided to give Cafe Rio a try. Home made tortillas made right in front of you and a similar line to Chipotle. I got the salad, my son the burrito both with shredded chicken. AWESOME.....salad was great, my son loved the burrito. Cafe Rio just moved up to his #2 favorite Mexican spot. Food was good, and I have one more coupon left, so I'll be stopping by again this week before it expires!   Thumbs up.....worth the stop. My bill was $9.15 for both with the coupon. YEAH!!

I like Pei Wei, I can't put my finger on why. The Kung Pao Chicken Extra spicy is great. I like sitting at the bar to watch all the cooks. Those guys are in the zone when they are back there cooking and its busy. It's a nice medium for me and my daughter, she likes the restaurant next door, I go to Pei Wei and we meet on the patio.

I've lived and worked on the corner of McClintock and Warner and never stopped here, today was the day. Shame on me.  Adorable little sandwich shop, bread, cookies, sandwiches, sweets for sale. Today I decided to get a couple different sandwiches. One hot, one cold and eat them both throughout the day. Normally I would roll my eyes at the amount of bread on a sandwich, but the panni bread was outstanding, messy but a great sandwich. 2nd was the cobb on wheat, a little disappointed when opened my 2nd sandwich and it was plain old wheat bread. BUT....the sandwich was great, great avocado and spinach on it. I'm a fan of both. I always try to support the little guy, so I will dump my usual sandwich place and make the hike across the street to here!! I was so tempted to grab a package of cookies, but I didn't see and macadamia nut around, so I saved myself a 1000 calories today.

Oh Zipps, what can I say. I try to stay away from chains, my kids roped me into coming.  "their chicken strips are suppose to be the bomb"  If bomb means greasy as hell and you leave feeling the grease coming out of your pours, then yes they are the bomb. Both my kids ate 1/4 and just ate their fries. I had a club sandwich which was fine.  I'm sure this place is great for watching sports. I didn't think the happy hour deals were all that exciting to get me to come back. I walk away not a fan.

First time at Sals. I ordered pick up on a Saturday night at 8pm. Glad I didn't lug my family of 5 down here tonight.  Packed house all seats taken PLUS about 10 people in line for a table.  Good for them.....wonderful problem to have.  Our white pizza was OUTSTANDING.......probably one of the best I've had. Next time I think I'll add some garlic to it.  Medium pepperoni for the kids, just as good.  Gilbert has some great locally owned pizza places, lived here a year and trying to test them all. Haven't had a bad one yet!!!!   Good job Sals, we'll be back!!!

Stay-cation in downtown Scottsdale. I really liked the hotel, stumbling distance from the bars. Room were beautiful and the shower could fit at least 8 people. The front desk clerk gave us a free round of drinks upon arrival because our room wasn't going to be ready for another 15 minutes. Bartender was a wet blanket.....zero personality. I'd gladly stay here again.

I never knew I missed this place until I walked back into it. I was a member about 8 years ago and quit once I got into the shape I wanted. Now as I rotate my gyms and fitness places, looks like Im back to the top of the list.  I guess the $60 per month pretty much kept me away for a while, after all you can pay only $10 a month for a gym membership nowadays right? After my last fitness journey at a crossfit place I was paying $90 a month, I figured to give Life Time a shot again. Really I mean, how can you go wrong here? I can work out, swim, eat lunch, sit in the steam room or hot tub, bring my kids, play basketball, rock climb and so on. Perfect for summertime when Im looking for something to do for my 11 year old that doesn't involve a computer of PS4.   The only negative thing I'll say is they made me sit down with a personal trainer and have an "evaluation" done.  I knew what was coming........ $900 blood test $250 workout that involved a mask and a treadmill. $90 an hour personal training and of course the massive amount of nutrients my body is missing that ONLY Lifetime fitness sells. Then he proceeded to tell me I have 40lbs of fat I need to lose, I don't work out correctly, I don't eat correctly,  overall I don't live my life correctly and Im just completely wasting my time working out unless I follow his plan. I get it, your a 50% trainer 50% salesman, just a squirrel trying to get his monthly commission nut.   Avoid this if you can. There needs to be a little more tweaking in the salesmen department if you ask me. After an hour with this guy, all I got out of it was I was fat and I needed him and his multi-thousand dollar fitness program.   I would of given 5 stars if I didn't have to sit through this time share presentation first. Lame.

My daughter stopped in for lunch on Saturday and I got some HUGE double decker turkey sandwich....even though I think it's a bit pricey......you get ALOT of food for that money. You're not walking away from Chompies hungry by any means. Daughter had chocolate chip pancakes.....good....but it's kind of hard to screw up pancakes. Right on ASU campus.

Well, here is your classic definition of a dive bar. By the shape of the roof, I'm guessing this was a Pizza Hut at one time. I've passed by this place 100 times and finally stopped on a Saturday afternoon.  Cheap drinks, beer, mixed drink and a shot....$14.....got to love that! Charming bartender, good and attentive. I'll stop by again!!

Saturday afternoon with my 10 year old, today he chose Dave and Busters. $23 sure doesn't go very far in an arcade anymore. Always a fun time with your kids here, had some snack during our visit. Quesadilla's and sliders, nothing to write home about, quick easy bar food.

Love love LOVE San Tan.  Awesome beer selection, and the food is FREEKING INCREDIBLE. This is a must stop ever time Im in downtown Chandler. The San Tan Slingers and a Mr. Pineapple is the perfect start to a day of day drinking!

Pfffftttttt.......ordered the scrambled egg breakfast with bacon and toast. The eggs.....terrible. Bacon.....its the PRE COOKED bacon......I HAVE THIS AT HOME! Toast.....1 piece and from the smallest loaf in the history of bread. I only came to kill an hour and use the WiFi.  Go somewhere else for a real breakfast.

All you can eat sushi for $25 and 1 penny beer? Not for me, that is just going to make me bloat up like a balloon. Great offer.....not for me tonight.  Me and the wife stopped in, she's feeling under the weather and wanted some type of spicy soup.  I ordered the seared tuna for an app.  She had the soup with the bonsai broth and chicken, thumbs up! Even I was stealing some of it. I had the entree the beef. Came with peppers and onions, I asked for it SUPER spicy, ehh......it's not Korean, so Im sure its the best they could do. It was good, no complaints, we'll be back!!!!

As Orient lured me back into its good graces for a 4 star review on 2/18/16, Sunday night we ordered take out. 3/6. About 2 weeks from our last visit.  And let me say I wouldn't have wrote THIS review if it wasn't for the poor response we got from the owner. i would of chalked it up as a bad experience.....but he pushed my buttons.  As I ate my beef and vegetables, the texture wasn't great. Very slimy as I tried to chew and I knew after the 3rd bite to stop. I continued to pick and eat the veggies.  I also ordered some chicken lettuce wraps as a back up because I was starving. I doctored up 2 on my plate and shoved the entire first one in my mouth.....hmmmmmmm funky.  Unusual crunchiness and a pungent after taste like a strong cheese was in it........as I take a bite of my 2nd one......again.......funky.  I'm done with my meal. I'll pass on the details to follow that night.  We simply called the next day to tell the establishment that it was NOT good, we became very nauseous and we would like our dinner money back. "NO ONE ELSE SICK" "THIS IS WHY WE HAVE INSURANCE" "GO TO DOCTOR AND TURN INTO OUR INSURANCE" "NOTHING I CAN DO" "NO REFUNDS!!!    NOT EVER!!""  My wife and son are more lunch time regulars than I am, and she always gets a BIG welcome every time she's in there with him. With dozens of Asian restaurants in the Gilbert area we will simply take Orient off our list. ATTENTION OWNERS.......this is where a kind...."I'm sorry your meal wasn't good last night" would of spoke volumes to us a valued customer. Even if thats all we got and you STILL refused our refund, a simple "Sorry" would of kept 2 regular lunch customers coming back.   I'm Sorry for my one star review.

First off, I don't think I could write enough good things about this place.  I'm a huge small business guy, so I will always come to the mom and pop places before a chain.  First timers tonight, our family of 5 plus G'ma and G'pa, immediately as we walked into the place Tony (I'm guessing the owner) comes out and shakes our hands and sends garlic knots over to the table.  We ordered pizza, pasta and meatball subs........every thing was excellent a perfect 10!!!!! G'ma went up and ordered 4 different desserts at the end........and again....perfect.   He has non stop people coming in through the door on a Friday night, WHY?.....because of how awesome he treats his customers. He recognized every customer that has been in that place before. Shaking hands, hugging the ladies and saying goodbye to every person that walked out the door.   The only negative I could say is we would of liked beer or wine.....no biggie, we'll live.  Tony you have our business. Casanova will now be our GO-TO spot for family pizza night.

Stopped in and met some friends on Sunday, awesome acoustic act on the patio. Drink special were drinks 1/2 off, WHOO HOO! Did not try any food sadly, but what I saw go by my table, it looked awesome! I live about 30 miles away from BM, but I've liked it every time I've came here. Great attentive wait staff too!!!  When I'm in the area, I'll be by!!

I will have to disagree with some of these reviews. My kids and I stopped in on Wednesday evening and had great service. We always have.  Attentive staff all the way around. I had the chicken and steak fajita plate, no beans, no rice, no tortilla's. I ordered rancho style and expected it super spicy, but no so much. I've had Arriba spicy before and my mouth was on fire, but no big deal.  I also forgot my sunglasses on the table and they ran out to the parking lot to give them to me. So we remain big fans of Arriba.

OOOOOOOHHHHHHHH...........now I see where the bad reviews come from.  I was here on Wed with my kids and had great service.........instead of BBQ on Labor day weekend we decided to come back here.......should of went with the BBQ  Sat in the bar..........took 15 min for someone to acknowledge us. We ordered.......Medelo Especial, Dos XX lager and a shot of Cabo Wabo tequila. We got.......get this........house margarita, Negro Medelo and a shot of some type of tequila (wasn't Cabo Wabo). We seriously had 5 different people serve us food, drinks, and check on us. My guess is it isn't the staff, they do not have a proper manager in this place. All the servers don't have a direction or structure. In my 2 times here this week, I have looked my servers in the eye and told them to make my food AS SPICY AS THEY CAN. What ever you have to make my mouth on fire, do it.....both times BLAH. My wife and daughter both had the tortilla soup this time, nothing to write home about.  Again I don't blame Alicia Silverstone our waitress, the entire bar seemed disorganized and clueless. We sat in the bar area and the bartender was behind the bar maybe 3-4 in the night.  If this place is here at Xmas time, I will be greatly surprised. Adios Arriba.

Wow, adorable. This was the final piece to my downtown Gilbert puzzle. I now think I've been to every nook and cranny down here. I was waiting for my daughter while she was getting her taxes done and walked down here. I ordered some herbal tea thats good for your lymphatic system.....it was decent. The set up is awesome!!!  I am now avoiding any chain coffee shop and coming here, this place is great.

What can you say about DOS?  I've been here a dozen times. If you know.......you know. Drinks in an open aired bar, good music and fun times. This was stop #2 on Sunday Funday for us. Bloody Mary bar?......YES.  Tons of stuff.......yes STUFF to put in your bloody mary. Loved it. After an hour in of watching everyone get plowed at noon. (you know.......yeah you know) We ordered some pretty bomb ass nachos that hit the spot.  Other than that, you know this place is just nuts on the weekend nights. I think when we all hear the name Dos gringo's we all have that same drunken memory from this place.  We all do that same nod. "Oh yeah, that one night at Dos" I know I've spent many birthday's here and other peoples birthdays and have participated in Bar Olympics.......good times DOS!!!

Being a white guy, I freeking love coming to this little Mexican market. I bring my kids for carne asada here once a week.....its incredible!!  The produce here is super cheap as well. I've been here a dozen times and I always want to over eat.....the all meat burritos are the best and cheap!!  Totally fun to walk around the market and look at things that Fry's or Albertson's doesn't have. Who doesn't want to see a cow head in the meat section??   See you soon!!!

YES! I'm a fan.  You can throw a rock and hit a sushi restaurant anywhere in Gilbert, but I have to say I like this place the best. Attentive staff, great food and cheap. I opted for the Bulgoki beef and a couple of rolls tonight. The beef is so good, after I got mine, other people ordered it at my table!  The stuffed jalapeno's are freeking awesome too. Great job, we'll always be back!!

First time here at Jerseys. Tucked away in a strip mall next to a variety of shops.  First impression---This is a bar for career alcoholics. I have a feeling these people are in the same exact spot every single day, seemed to me everyone knew each other, and the bartenders knew exactly what they drank and when to give them a new cocktail. I'm betting they all live within a couple of miles from here too.  Stage for bands, pool tables, smoking patio typical bar scene. No IPA's on draft had to settle for a Kilt Lifter, did not eat food but it looked like a typical bar menu, fried food, burgers, pizza. If my friends band wasn't playing here, I probably would of never stepped foot in this place.   Jerseys........ehhh.......I've been in better, I've been in worse. This bar is a solid C on the grading scale. If there was a 1/2 star I would of given it 2 1/2.  Side note.....bar staff and waitress was very attentive and great.....5 stars for them.

Well, its an AZ casino. Clubs, gambling, over priced drinks and lots of cigarette smoke. I've only been here for OTHER peoples occasions. I've never decided to just come here on my own. Concerts, birthday parties, tonight I knew a band playing in the showroom. Cool venue, great sound, tons of people. I'm a tequila drinker, so when I asked for a double patron on the rocks, I saw it come out of a gun......grrrrrrr. I hate alcohol out of a gun, you have no idea what your getting. 17.50 for a double shot and $6 bucks for a corona. Pregame is the word here. Valet was nice and quick when I decided to leave though......IM OUT!

Dessie's I really want to like you. I will refuse to go to any Denny's or Ihop for breakfast. I will always pick 100% local. I've reviewed before and I'll review again to put in my 2 cents.  Again the green chili omelette was blah.  The green chili is obviously from a can, and its going bad, it was REALLY bad. I had to scrape it off my eggs.  So I love rock and roll more than anyone, but when I was in there 99% of your customers are elderly. So the Alice in Chains blasting from the kitchen, probably not a good idea. I don't mind it, but again I'm not 80. 2nd. Your cooks look like they're from a Mad Max film. When they're not cooking they pier through the window and stare at the customers like they're in prison.......creepy just plain creepy.  Besides the reasonable prices and the waitress, I can't say anything positive about the place.  Good luck in the Thunder Dome.

Lovely venue, it would of got 5 stars if the staff wasn't so rude. Clearing the tables was not a favorite of the staff. Shaking their heads and mumbling under their breath as they walk away.  Much recommended.

It just doesn't get any better that Airworx. My son has been to about 20 birthday parties here and he loves it every time. Plenty of seating for adults to sit and talk to one another. Bouncy slides, basketball, dodgeball and video games. Last night my son actually threw a fit because he had to leave. Even 3 hours wasn't long enough for him. See you soon!!!

Ever just finish a meal and be full, but it was SO GOOD you just wanted to order another one, just because? This is how I feel about their Chicken Thai Quesadilla.......it was bliss. I saw them at the art walk in Gilbert and worth every penny of $9. They told me they would be back in 2 weeks, and I'll be there. Next time Im going to order it extra spicy!!!

New owner? Same place? I was here once before watching a Green Bay game, didn't look like much has changed. My girl and I stopped in because we heard there was live music now.  First......bartender was great and attentive, good beer selection. 2nd....Food, my girl ordered tot madness or something....tots, bacon hot dogs and chili....terrible.....not their fault, my girl ordered it.  Live music doesn't count in my book unless theres a stage. Being in a band I will never ever play on the floor. Im not quite sure if the live music was a comedy act. The guy seemed to have a parody to every song he sang on got lame really quick, too bad too, he had a great voice. He had his own little following of 20 people that found him amusing.   Being a live music lover here's my advice.  Pull the trigger and build a stage and get a sound system. You have a great bar, and we are all tired of O'Kellys. I will come to Scullys ANYTIME over them if you make it look like a LIVE MUSIC VENUE.  Good Luck and hope to be back again!!! Come on Scullys.......SAVE US!!!!

Jolie, Jolie, Jolie.....JOLIE"s........I've been past this bar 100 times, it's busy from 6am to 2am. ALWAYS has cars in front of it. There must be cock fights in the back or they're giving something away for free. Saturday night we stopped in because the Stiletto's were playing there, and to a packed house of course.  Big spacious bar, couple of pool tables, nice looking bar staff, reasonable drink prices. This is just an average bar. Thats all I can say, nothing bad, nothing great, a solid C I give it. I went to the bathroom before I left at about 1am, a couple of guys came out of a stall together, so I'm assuming it possibly has that element about it.

LOVE THIS PIZZA!!!! Stopped by Sunday night to avoid the Point and their outrageous prices. We yelped pizza and decided to come check it out. Out-F'ing-standing. I had 2 slices of the spinach and cheese and this was the first pizza that EVER has melted in my mouth, HOLY CRAP it was delicious. My daughter had the white pizza (they made special for her) and again, her eyes lit up with her first bite.  The owner came out and chatted with the kids and the staff was super friendly coming in, during and on the way out.  I'm sad I live in Gilbert, so I won't be able to frequent this place as often as I would like, I would make this our GO TO pizza place if we lived closer. A MUST STOP!!!!

Hike up Camelback Mountain, been on a super healthy kick the past 2 weeks.  Enough Turkey and chicken, I need a burger and I told my girl i knew EXACTLY where to go. I've eaten here 4 times now, good solid burgers.   Sat on the patio, ordered a couple of Hop Knot IPA and waited for our burgers. Now I don't want to under sell my poblano burger, which was good, but my wife ordered the Peanut Butter and Jelly Burger with THICK cut bacon.  WTF???  The combination of these 3 flavors work so incredibly well together it made me dizzy. I didn't even want to eat mine. Mind blowing good. All the melted peanut butter and jelly that dripped out of the burger and onto the plate made a great dipping sauce for the fries too!!  Out of all the burgers I have eaten in my 40 year old life, this will make my top 3 of all time. Shout out to our awesome waiter Pickle for being so awesome too!

It's small maybe only 10-15 different tents. I like walking through it, but for a guy, there's nothing much for me to purchase besides salsa. Homemade soaps, crepes, organic manure, old lady trinkets, dresses, yoga stuff and etc.  They do have food, usually 1-2 tents, but last time I was there, it was in a tent and in a big warmer, not cooked fresh. If there was a food truck and I knew it was freshly cooked, I may eat, but not if its been sitting in a bin. It's a good attempt for a farmers market, but for a dude, there's nothing for me.

Ordered my IPA and Jameson shot, and I know my whiskey, they had it watered down. DAMN IT!!!!  Bar staff was good, didn't try any food. Harvey's did nothing to excite me, doubt I'll be back.

Needing a change in my motivation, I switched gyms this week. Printed out the free day pass from their website and went and checked the place out. It's big and spacious, very similar to P.F. I think. I dig it, new equipment, tvs in the treadmills, big open area for lunges and stretching. I came back in, signed up with the $10 a month deal. BS.....$30 sign up fee and $40 annual fee.....blah blah blah. So $10 turns into $15 a month after all the add on fees. Basic locker room, trainers etc. I've only gone in the morning, seems pretty quiet.  Gave it 4 stars, because it's everything you basically want in a gym, but nothing here has wow'd me.

ME: (down on one knee) Backyard Taco.......I want you inside of me, and I want to be inside of you. I have never fell in love so deeply with a taco place. I don't want you to see any other people and I want to be exclusive. I will marry you right now on the spot if you let me.  I won't care what other people say about our love, we can make this work.  As I sat and gazed into my carne asada taco's, loving every bite that went into my mouth, I looked up at the menu. "I wonder if I could put that family pack away myself?"   I may have to wait until our 2-3rd date. I don't want to seem like a pig. I swear as of this day, Backyard Taco......I pledge my love and 100% devotion to you. I will not stray EVER from the love I have for you.  No more Joyride, no more LuLu's and I swear I will never see Los Fav's ever again. It's just you and me.......forever.    One more thing........can I get a part time job here? You can pay me in taco's.

Sunday fun day downtown Scottsdale as I just ate and found this place, it instantly reminded me of Cabo. I stopped to tell them how awesome the carne asada smelled and expressed my remorse for just eating. He hands me 2 cards for 2 free tacos anyway.......and I came back a few hours later to cash in........FABULOUS!! A must stop if your in old town!!

As my girl and I leave Gilbert in search of live music we hit this place for the first time. Our excitement is high after we just left the Crescent Ballroom and head over to our 2nd bar of the night.........F*%K ME......what a waste.  No parking at all, we walk up and pay $10 cover EACH.......this is going to be good right?..........No.......no seating, theres like 4 tables and people sitting on the floor watching a guy playing acoustic guitar on stage. Maybe 25 people in there.....and NO ALCOHOL.....beer and wine only.  I payed $20 for open mic and a horrible draft beer.  I have no idea what I paid $20 for.  Last Exit.........Last time for me!!!

Another Love hate relationship I have. We stopped in on a Friday night at 7pm, pretty empty for a Friday night in downtown Gilbert.......Hmmmm......will this be around much longer? With only 20 people in the place, how often are they making FRESH sushi back there? I'm only seeing one sushi chef........  PROs...........cheap, variety, small portions (so you can try many different rolls) and fun to watch food on a conveyor belt.  CONs.........the sushi is warm, squishy, and all my selections tasted the same.  There's really no way to tell how long that piece of fish has been at room temp.  PLUS++++.......I got my kids to try sushi for the first time and they liked it....ALOT, had loads of fun watching the rotation of food past our table.

So I've had 3 tattoo artists in my time. One in my 20's, one in my 30's, one in my 40's. Each have had a section of my body. In my 20's I started on my legs, 30's I moved to my arms and when I turned 40 I did my chest.  I'm 43 now and decided to start on my back.   Joe will be the 4th tattoo artist I have worked with.   I met Joe Garner in a bath house in Thailand many years ago and we clicked, surprisingly we both lived in the valley. I told him if I could ever leave the opium dens and wonderful bath houses of this wonderful country, I would have him tattoo my back. Thank goodness in my hallucinated state of mind, I some how managed to keep his card.   Years Iater....... As I emerge from my opium addiction I am back home in the states. After several detoxs and rehab clinics I came in a discussed my dreams with Joe and told him my visions I had in the spirit world. He took what I said in interpreted it perfectly. We did a 3 hour beginning session and it went awesome. I'm guessing it will take 4-8 sessions to finish my dream, and I look forward to every session.   Next Wave tattoo, thumbs up. ALSO.....they have the most awesome looking bathroom I've ever seen in a tattoo shop......nice touch.   Joe, nice job my friend. We'll see you next month!!

I had chronic gas for months. There were days I couldn't take a step without passing gas. Going to the gym? Running? Forget about it. Thank you Laurie Peterson for getting my life back to normal. I can now get back into the dating scene without walking around with my cheeks clinched together.  Thank you again. You have changed my life

GREAT $5 pita special, awesome jalapeño hummus. I liked this place a lot!!!!  My one complaint?.......SWEEP YOUR FREEKING FLOORS. Owners, get your teenage help off their cell phones and tell them to grab a broom. It was pretty discussing to look at while eating.  YOU GOT TIME TO LEAN, YOU HAVE TIME TO CLEAN........START SWEEPIN!!!!

Stopped in on a Saturday at 9pm. Acoustic guy in the bar with about 12 people in the whole place.  We must have been blending in with everyone because it was 20 min before someone came and took our drink order, ONLY after we flagged him down.  My girls margarita was weak, so she asked for another shot, that was completely forgotten about, AGAIN, we had to flag down the bartender.  The bar staff is VERY focused on the regulars sitting at the bar, we seemed like a burden to the staff.  On a positive note, he did comp the extra tequila shot,  but had to flag him down for the check when the acoustic guy started playing old 70's TV show themes.....TIME TO GO!!!

Yes, Im a fan of the HOB, the place gets better and better. They have a great craft beer selection, and the bartenders have a good knowledge of what they're selling. I can't speak for the food, I've only drank here. Great beer menu on 4 TV screens next to the bar is pretty cool. Keep it up HOB!!!!

WARNING!!!! If you come here and get the waitress with the do-rag, resting bitch face and the nicotine patch.......MOVE SECTIONS IMMEDIATELY.    REQUEST IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF SECTION, get your own drinks or go to the kitchen to deliver your own food.  We sat in amazement with this girl. It became funny during our stay, because she just kept getting worse. We had to literally WAVE our hands in the air to get attention EVERY TIME.  We stopped the underage bus boy 90% or the time and ordered drinks through him, then she would bring them.  We asked for the bill........she brought us another round of drinks.  Here's something crazy, just a suggestion, I'm no bar owner or anything.   When the bill comes, could you put my food AND drinks on the same bill? We had 2 bills. 1 for food, 1 for drinks.  Sadly, we got the bill and SAW only the drinks were on there, we were like....awwwww she realizes she's terrible...............and as we stood up, she brought our food bill.   Not a thank you, thanks for coming in, have a good night.....nothing.  I'm guessing the nicotine patch was empty.

I've been following them on FB for awhile, I got excited seeing all the vintage concert tshirts and decided to make the trip downtown.  Yeah.........$140 for a t-shirt......A T-SHIRT?  Did the people in the bands actually wear them at some point?  I was really hoping for a cooler selection of jeans too, but hey, what can you do?  Nice helpful staff, but way out of my price range for clothes.

Legit haircut! I found them on yelp. I was in desperate need of a 180 degree haircut. I'm way to afraid to go into any Supercuts. I always look for someone young to cut my hair. I got Kelly. Bubbly little red head that was friendly and talkative. Made me feel comfortable and listened to every detail I wanted done to my hair, and I appreciate that. I went in not knowing what I was going to pay and was pleasantly surprised it was only $25. TOTALLY WORTH IT. I'll be back, thanks Kelly!

I wish I could write a review for this place, I've stopped here 4 times in the past year and there's ALWAYS a 40 min PLUS wait. They must be doing something right, it's busy all the damn time. Good for them. I stopped on a Sunday afternoon and couldn't get in again, on we went to downtown Gilbert.  I heard they are expanding, so hopefully they'll be able to seat more people soon.

We finally got in!!!!  This is our 4th attempt to get in here and it took a Monday afternoon at 4 to  get in. Started with the IPA.....very good. Me and my girl split a jalapeño jelly and PB burger that was off the chain!!  Great fries with it too!!!  Our little waitress was kick ass! So if I come here again, I must come early, thats the key!!!!

Bought a PS4 here that I saw advertised on Offer Up.  I was skeptical about buying a used PS at a pawn shop, but for $250 I thought I would gamble. The clerk was very polite and told me it there was ANY problems, just to bring it back and he would exchange it.  It works great, my kids happy and glad I saved some $$ instead of going to Game Stop.

I liked it. I was pretty wrecked when I was there, I slightly remember eating a pizza, and listening to a guitar player and a lot of birds. Props to the staff for putting up with our obnoxiousness. I think it has potential to be my favorite bar in Chandler.

Cant say enough good things about this place. I saw their A-Frame sign as I drove by for $99 taxes done......after paying 5X that amount the past couple of years, I had to stop. First time in 20 years I have actually gotten a refund back.   Personable, and SUPER HELPFUL......they hounded me for receipts and write-offs for my business (I didn't mind). They even schooled me for next year on what to save. Im go glad I stopped in. For years I have DREADED getting my taxes done, because i have always owed......not anymore.  This year I'm saving every receipt!!!!!!!

My kids have some type of passionate love for this place.   As an adult, I don't get it. Over priced chicken strips. It's always completely packed the drive through is always 10 deep. People love this place, I don't. To pricey to take a family of 4.....for chicken strips and fries.

2nd Sunday in s row we've ordered from here.  Today I ordered the Thai Hot........and ate every last bite.  I am officially in love with this place. I made my wife a fan too!  When I placed my order she didn't want anything, but I got her some anyway, she's hooked too!!!!

Stopped in C.S. on a Sunday to nurse a hangover, after searching yelp for a new place we decided here.  The blonde bartender was outstanding, chatty, friendly, and quick with our orders. They had my favorite beers on tap (Hop Knot and Summer Shanty) The garlic fries are a must have, we licked the bottom of the skillet when we were done!!  We also had the grilled cheese burger, a grilled cheese on sourdough with a burger patty in the middle. It was.....ok.  Interior was pretty plain jane nothing dazzled me. Over all I'll come back because of the friendly staff and the decent beer on tap......and the garlic fries.

I've been to several Pita Jungle's in the Valley. This one breaks the mold, I felt like I was in a 5 star restaurant. The decor, and the food presentation was 10 fold any other P.J.  My spanikapita was presented beautifully!! Turkey Burger, perfect. Even my daughter ALWAYS has the chipotle chicken lavosh pizza, and it tasted better than any other.......Why is this one so different?  Our server had the personality of a wet mop though, he was one piece of this puzzle I didn't get.

First and foremost I am not a vegan or a vegetarian, but I do eat as healthy as i can. I had 90 minutes to kill on a Friday and I was hungry and I'm slimming down for my Mexico trip in a couple months, this seems perfect for dinner.  Hipster little place, decor and staff. The kid behind the counter, was NO help with the menu telling me "I really haven't tried much on the menu"......great I'll have to wing it. I ordered the jalapeño poppers, jalapeño hummus inside a small red pepper over a giant plate of lettuce. Also the the Tu-No salad, tuna flavored quinoa over some greens. then I had a green tea. It was good and different for me, I'd come back if I was in the area.  I felt a little on the pricey side, my meal was $21 for those 3 things.

What a great atmosphere for a place in Tempe. If you haven't gone here yet, its the best place in Tempe to eat outside. My girlfriend and I love it here. Great outside patio and a HUGE inside bar. Great beer selection and great house drinks...the hurricane is awesome and so its the sangria!! If you have a perfect AZ weather day, treat yourself to this awesome place!!!

Inside Water and Ice. Water, Ice, iPod, iPhone, Ipad, and Mac computers fixed on the table. There maybe cock fights in the back, not quite sure. I'd come back to have my stuff fixed here again, he's quick and cheap.

I purchased my very living social deal. This was it, oil change and full service car wash only $18.....great deal! It was quick and had me out the door within 30 min. Inside waiting room was super nice, I enjoyed my first visit to Cobblestone, and thrilled that it was only 30 min. I've spent longer in a Jiffy lube. I'll be back!!!

Giving Bisbee a 2nd try, I was by myself today and sat at the counter.  Again, I like the atmosphere and my waitress was great but the food is just so bland. California omelette again. I asked for 4 eggs instead of 3 this time.  Guacamole is zero taste, the eggs don't even taste right and there wasn't a shred of bacon in it either. I can see the cooks preparing hash browns from a box (lame), I opted for cottage cheese after seeing that. I want to like this place, but after 2 attempts and giving the same review, I won't make it back in. Sorry.

As my Valentine night is coming to an end after a fabulous dinner in downtown Tempe we decide to stop at MWC for the first time on our way home at about 10:30. As we get our drinks in front of us, the music stops and the packed Cellar starts to file out the door. Wait....What?  The place is packed on a Saturday night and you close at 11pm? Ummm......ok.  We get our bill......$19.27 for a beer and a glass of house pinot?  Where am I? Thanks but no thanks, I doubt I'll be back. I really wanted to like this place too.

Dont.......just dont. This guy tore through my hair like he was trying to set a hair cut record. No style to his cutting what so ever. It seemed like he tried to squeeze me in between appointments and didn't want to make his other regular customers wait. I was a casualty that had to be made. I walked out looking like Howie Long, like a block head with a square head. So much for trying to gain a customer, I won't be back.

My 3rd visit to Biscuits.  First time, I fell in love. 2nd time, I fell out of love. 3rd time......they restored my love. I had the house omelette added bacon, green chili's and jalapeños. Best omelette EVER!! Also I'm not a usual home fries type of guy, but these were exceptional!!! I cleaned my plate......OK OK.....I'll be back!

I really like this place.  For some odd reason I like pictures of sushi, it takes out a lot of the guessing what Im ordering half the time. I love all the combo's as well. I ordered one of their boxes last time, and the beef was outstanding!!  The dessert they serve at the end is AWESOME!!!!

Up in north Scottsdale for a soccer tournament with 3 hours to kill in between matches with our kids. We look up on yelp where to go and we decide on OHSO.  So....a total of 20 PLUS arrive together, seated promptly and waitress comes to take our order.  I wasn't going to give 5 stars because the dramatic heavy sigh and over done eye roll when we ask for seperate checks. But she pulled through it all.  I know it sucks, a big pain in the butt......deal with it. Other than that, she was on point and a very attentive waitress. $10 brunch menu AND a mimosa, beer or bloody mary? HOW IS THIS PLACE NOT PACKED?? Bagel and Lox was hands down he best I've ever had and the mimosa was 90% champagne!! My type of pour!   Day 2......We're back again.....3 hours to kill. I arrived before the rest of team and requested the section to the right of the patio and promptly seated, we had it all to ourselves. Good move, especially with 10 hyped up boys playing soccer.  This time we had it all on one check........not because of me, but because someone in our group volunteered to put it on his CC.......smh. I hate that.  I had the breakfast wrap and 2 mimosa's!  I wish I didn't live in the east valley, I would be here every weekend!!   Staff is a 10 here. The food was great and the drinks were outstanding

Our restuarant pick is Geno's.  I was really hoping this was going to be good. Gyro.......sub par. C- Baked turkey sub.....good flavor......I liked it.  Give that a B Mediterranean salad tasted like ass. The chicken looked like cat food, half the stuff I ordered on line WASNT on it. The online menu lets you customize it, and to top it off, nothing like getting home and finding no dressing in your bag.  Pizza tasted like a $5 pizza, no pizzaz there, nothing to write home about.  My pick up was right on time, didn't have to wait. Geno's gets a solid C- for us.

Where do I begin on this one? First off........an upgrade from the last Club Red. Almost a 2.0.......maybe too much of an upgrade. We like our RnR dirty and sleazy and in shit hole bars......this is like a palace.  Kick ass awesome stage, nice bathrooms and the sound quality was top notch.  BUT......$20 to enter to see Tribute band was wicked high, and to walk in at 10pm....there was maybe 40 people in the place. Bartenders were lack luster, I bought 2 drinks ($14) gave him a hundred dollar bill, got $6 back........HEY!! Don't think so, but he made it right.  Cans of Beer and doing shots out of plastic jello shot cups is pretty pathetic. I miss the old Club Red, it's going to take a lot to get me back in this place, and if I do, I will do some major pre-gaming in the parking lot before I have to come in.

I have returned to BRI. My girlfriend was so hungry coming out of the movies, she was going to pass out, she headed right over to BRI. Craft beer and a burger? Lead the way baby!!  Love the staff, good personality and SUPER helpful with the menu, great suggestions!! BEER, had the street cred IPA........good. 2nd beer, White Russian......HOLY CRAP!!  A white russian in beer form, could be the most wonderful beer I've ever tasted and at 9.5%.........AWESOME, it may have changed my life.  FOOD Pretzel bites with mustard and cheese........ehh.........very doughy. Not crazy about them. I had the Cubano sandwich.........good, not bad. Girl......burger with fried egg and meat candy on top, over cooked a bit, but tasty!!! The highlight was their fries!!!  They were AWESOME!!!!    Next time I come in I'm just going to eat their fries and a glass of meat candy and drink White Russians...........NICE JOB BRI!!!!

Here's why I'm a fan of the Spirit bar.  A year ago, a week before I go on a 10 day vacation my entire house hold comes down with some type of cold. Crap. I head down to this place and he hooked me up with an immunity booster and wheat grass shots.  The booster had ginger, acai berries, cheyenne pepper and some other things in it.  He gave me instructions as I drank it.  Drink 1/4 of the glass then wait an hour, repeat until it's gone. There's a lot of stuff in this drink your body needs to absorb. Needless to say, I did not catch the house hold cold.  As of 2016, I have not had a cold or any type of flu in over 4 years. My time ran out, 2 days into my cold I head down and they set me up with the same remedy. It cut my symptoms in half by the next day.  Im not saying they are some type of voodoo dr or anything, but they know their stuff. Before I start shoving cold remedy's from Walgreens in my systems, I will stop here first and do this. I think it works for me. Either that or I have some superior gene's that I don't know about.  Thank you Spirit bar.

Now, i've been coming to Zia for about 25 years now, and since they've opened these MEGA stores in the east valley they've improved 100%. As my teenage daughter has gotten into music this has become her favorite place on earth.  The customer service and friendliness of the staff is night and day from when I was a youngin. Books, DVDs, toys and video games all for sale new and used. I have also taught them the Trade in!!! Bringing their old video games, cd's and DVDs to use for store credit. Of course you won't get much for them BUT, better than sitting on a shelf collecting dust and its fun to have free range of the store.  Here's my one complaint for Zia with Musical equipment.................90% of the guitars and basses you have for sale are crap. You cannot charge $200 for a squire guitar or some other crappy model. You need to stop buying crap like that or at least mark them down ALOT.

First and foremost, I come to WinCO because it's employee owned and I support their fair wages that they get payed. I like the store but it's so FREEKING HUGE. I don't like the set up of the store, you can be shopping for food and BAM the next isle is something different all together. HUGE produce dept and they have a lot of hard to find items. They are incredibly cheap in some areas. AND.......I like to bag my own grocery's. I like to jam as much stuff into my own bags as I possibly can. WinCo is my place

Minder Binder's.......I remember this place from the early days. They have done a great job restoring this place and modernizing it and keeping nostalgic. Love it, stopped in for a couple cocktails on a Sunday, can't wait to come back and eat, the food that went by the bar looked AWESOME. (sadly I just ate).....I saw Wisconsin cheese curds on the menu.....so i'll be back. The bartenders were super chatty and friendly, so can't wait to come back!!

First time here with my kids on a Saturday afternoon, and we had a freeking blast!!!!! This will take the place of our get out of the heat bowling Saturday. My 10 year old had the time of his life!  It's a bit pricey.....$35 an hour from Noon-5.......but it's priceless to see my kids have a blast with their dad doing something sporty and outside when its 105 degrees. We didn't have much to eat, just some fries and I grabbed a Goose Island IPA. The service and staff was a perfect 10! Everyone took the time to explain how the games work and everything else. I will 100% be back hopefully with some adults next time!!!!!

I have stumbled across JC's on FB because the Harry McGraw band was playing on a Saturday night, I am a HUGE fan of this local musician. Luckly JC's is right down the street for me. Sat night me and my daughter decide to go down and listen for an hour maybe have a few appetizers.  I rather eat off an appetizer menu, than order a full meal....anywhere, especially if they have good apps,........no cheese sticks, chicken wings, basket of fries, nothing fried. When I saw the bar menu, I totally got excited. This is my type of place. First, the charcuterie board was great. Meats, cheeses, pickles, it was great. I think it could of used some crustinie's, or some type of bread with it.....but still it was great. Prime rib sliders.....off the hook. I could of ate 12 of them, so good. Daughter had the Big Mac Martini.....Mac & Cheese, bacon and jalapeño in a martini glass.......HOLY F**)$ that was great. Forget this tiny martini glass.....GIVE ME A BUCKET OF THIS!!! So nice to see my daughter's eyes light up when she took that first bite.  Needless to say Harry McGraw and awesome bar appetizers, I have now found my Saturday night spot.......See you next Saturday!!

Stopped in here after getting tattoo'd for a drink or two and some dinner with the wife, A beer rep came to our table as we sat down and offered to buy us our first beer that he was promoting. SCORE! (i forget what beer) It was Taco Tuesday so we had chicken, carne asada and the fish tacos. The only good ones were the fish, tons of flavor, the other 2 were...ehh. We also had the egg roll appetizer, which was actually pretty good.  I wish this place was closer to my house, I'd be here ALL THE TIME. I really like this place, very clean and cool looking. Im a FAN!!

Ehhhh........I don't like to give one star. This is nothing more than a step down from a Paradise Bakery. I ordered a scramble for breakfast and when they brought it to my table it looked like it been dropped on the floor then scooped up on a plate.  When what I assumed was the manager walks by he asks me how my breakfast was, I didn't say anything, I just gave him the most dis-satisfied look I could possibly give and pointed at my eggs............and walks away. WTH??  Next time I come in and dis-satisfied with my meal, I'll be sure to stand on my chair and announce that my breakfast looks like a 5 year cooked for the first time and it tastes like COMPLETE CRAP. As he continued to make his rounds, he refused to make eye contact with me and avoided my table within 10 feet.........good customer service buddy.   Plenty of other options in that parking lot. There's a pile of dirt to the right that might taste just as good.

That first bite of taco pizza was like taking a trip back to my childhood. The exact recipe as the midwest pizza chain.....they nailed it. PLUS, I couldn't be happier that they are a mile down the street from me.  If you grew up on this pizza like I did, this Happy Joes will not disappoint.  TACO PIZZA ABSOLUTELY RULES! This will now be the sole reason I work out each week. I work out so I can gorge myself once a week on their pizza.

Guilty little pleasure stop. The donuts are totally great, smells good, friendly staff. My son ordered a strawberry smoothie took one drink and didn't want it. I tasted it and it tasted like straight powder. Donuts are a 10, but stay away from the smoothies.

Sunday Funday Part 2. I'm a huge fan of downtown Gilbert and love that new places are popping up. My 2nd trip the the Barrio and my girlfriends 4th.  We sat down at the bar as usual. Slow afternoon, only a few tables filled and 4 other people at the bar. We both ordered a Modelo Especial on draft......so good. But I like a shot of silver tequila with my mexican beer, and going through the menu there isn't a shot under $8. I get the up sell part when our bartender tells me the reposado is better.......I get it. She then offered me an orange slice with cinnamon, and I politely declined. I like my silver tequila and my beer. WELL THATS THE MOST TRADITIONAL WAY TO DRINK TEQUILA........whoa whoa whoa.....settle down blondie.....your hair pulled back a little tight?  She must of took offense to my polite decline, because we had to ask 3 times for chips and salsa. Then we had the pleasure of listening to her bitch about her shifts for the next 10 minutes.  AGAIN, I didn't get anything to eat, our bartender had a resting bitch face and made it very unpleasant to sit at the bar. Didn't like the vibe at all. I had a good experience here and a bad, I will give Barrio one more chance on our next Sunday out. Hopefully it'll be better.

After reading all the 5 star reviews I found it a little fishy.  This place deserves every bit of a 5 star rating. I had my car towed in and even though it wasn't a giant repair to do, it was quick and ready that afternoon. Prices were reasonable and the staff was friendly. I will be back!!!

SUNDAY FUNDAY. We have friends that rave about Pomo, let's check it out.  Sunday afternoon.....dead. We were 2 of maybe 10 people in there. Good beer selection on tap, and I ordered meatball appetizer right away. Wait, $10 for 2 meatballs?.......that sucks. Couldn't bring myself to order a 12 inch pizza that would cost me $17.  Not a fan. Too pricey for us.

You get MINUS one star.  I handed you my punch card and then you didn't stamp it for the 3 drinks I ordered!!!!

I like this place. This little strip mall is full of places to eat. I'm on my 3/6 places so far and I like this one the best. Fresh and home made. I had the chicken Caesar wrap. Staff was uber friendly and I'll definitely be back!! I got my order to go so I could eat it on the road, glad I stopped!!!

First off.........what cool looking place. Hands down the most beautiful in downtown Tempe. I'm totally coming back here to day drink. 2nd.......Beer is legit. I had a couple IPA's that were on the menu. Apps.......had the cheese curds......THE BOMB Lastly the food. Mom said the cheese burger was great. She usually only eats half, then takes the other half home.......she killed it.  I had the cuban, the recommendation from the waitress......it was ok. I wasn't wow'd. I will totally be back!!!!

Finally broke down to check out MOD pizza, I've past by it 100 times.  LEGIT!!!  This is a kick ass pizza place. Me and my 11 year old stopped in for dinner on a Thursday, staff was super friendly in helping out us first timers. My son was so overwhelmed with all the toppings he froze under pressure, I had to help him out. Actually i was too, trying to figure out what exactly would be my perfect pizza. I'm glad to say that I didn't make it my first time, so I WILL have to come back several more times to try again.  Super fun for my kid to put what ever he wanted on his pizza, I loved it too.  I wish I would of seen the gluten free option before I ordered!!! WE"LL BE BACK!!!!!!!!!

One word....hospitable. Rick was such a nice guy to meet. Good beers on tap and the pizza is great. He sat down and talked to us for a while, telling us about his restaurants he owned and the the future for his new place. I wish him the best of luck.

So numerous of these types of pizza places are popping up all over the valley. This will be the 2nd one I've been too. It's good, it's fun. I'm not blown away by any means. We had a party of 7 come in and ordered 7 different pizza's and sampling one another.  My 11 year old son ate two 7 inch pizzas!  I'll be back, my kids like it better than the other we've been too. I know these guys have been here awhile, and it sucks for them to see another EXACT replica pizza place going up `100 feet away and a MAJOR chain going in across the parking lot.  THUMBS UP EKLECTIC PIE!!  We also ordered 2 dessert pizzas that were the bomb!!!!

The tail end of Sunday Funday..............our last stop.  Sat down at the bar and the staff was awesome. Attentive, chatty, great knowledge of the menu, and an AWESOME beer selection. Had the habanero burger and it.....was.....awesome.   So, 1455 you have scored a couple of locals for your bar and we wish you luck!!  We need something in this area to call "our place" Keep us the good work, we'll be back, over and over again!!  See you soon!!!

Hidden gem is a correct description of this place.  We read the good reviews, we love local business, so we decided to check it out. Pretty empty for a Saturday night, us and maybe 4 other people, the staff was Uber friendly and we chatted with one of the owners behind the bar. They only have beer and wine, but they do have a full liquor license, which I think is a waste. As a customer, I would of drank a shot of whiskey with my IPA's and my wife would of drank a couple Martini's. Instead we each had 2 drinks. I had the pasta.....it was ok. I wasn't really studying the menu, and didn't know there was a small and large portion I could of ordered, so when my tiny bowl of pasta came out, I was a little taken back. It was gone in about 5-6 bites. Wife had a salad, which was perfect for her. I ended up ordering a BOMB ASS PIZZA though. Get the pepperoni, and have them explain the origin of the pepperoni.....cool story.  Love the wood fire pizza oven, one of the best pizzas I've had in a long time. We'll be back for sure. We wish them the best. Put more liquor behind the bar!!!!

I come all the way from Gilbert for the Ahi Tuna burger. It's incredible. The wasabi is the perfect compliment on top of it.  Good beer selection, fries were ok. I'll be back again and again for that Ahi Tuna.........A+

I disagree with most of the negative comments. 9:30pm on a Saturday night for us. Yes, it was packed, but we got seated right away at a high top table. The staff was nothing but pleasant, the food was great and the cocktail menu is outstanding.  For people to give such negative reviews the first couple weeks is stupid. It's a new place and there needs to be a huge learning curve for the staff. Lighten up Francis. Like Todd's review....."I'm giving it one star because the manager was not present." Give me a break, that big of a restaurant, with that big of a staff that holds THAT many people. I'm sure the manager of that place has 49 things to worry about before he talks to your pouty ass trying to get a table and your 3 kids their chicken strips.  It's a new place inside an already busy outside mall thats already busy from the other restaurants in the area........what do you expect at happy hour?? People that leave these reviews have never worked in the service industry.  Sorry for the rant.
