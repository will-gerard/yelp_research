Ok this place was soo fantastic. I ordered the appetizer Sicilian garlic cheese bread. It had the perfect amount of cheese and garlic. The bread wasn't hard either just right. For my main entree I went with chicken broccoli fettuccine Alfredo. I definitely made the right choice. It tasted delicious! To top it off they include dessert with dinner. :)

One of my favorite spots. Wish they had indoor seating though. The rice is sensational. I also like the tostadas and green chili burritos.

It's Friday. I went in for a quick bite to eat. Ordered 2 shredded beef tacos and 1 fish taco. While I was waiting for my order I look down in disgust. This place is infested with cockroaches. I completely lost my appetite. I did mention this to employees. They said they'd let the manager know. Ewwww, I want to give them 0 stars

This place is horrible!!! They messed up my order and when I went to complain to management. She said there was nothing she could do about my problem. Looked at me , like I was the problem. Seriously?!? What the hell are you there for than? I understand we're in the west valley but there's no reason for the lack of customer service. The pizza was also not very good. They charge for refills if you go from a coke to a sprite. Like they're not both soft drinks. I will never go to this restaurant again. Gus's gets no stars from me.

I've been wanting to try this place out since it opened. So when the opportunity presented itself I was all in. It was a Friday night around 8pm. The wait was close to 30 minutes. Which I didn't mind. This place was packed. My friend and I ordered almost everything on the menu. lol 2lbs hot n juicy crawfish, shrimp, crab and black mussels. It was all delicious. You definitely have to work for a little bit of crawfish. lol but I wasn't in any rush. The clean up is simple. Leave all shells on table and the waitress ties up the whole tablecloth and throws it. Oh boy did we make a mess. I do recommend using gloves when eating. And maybe trying a variety of sauces not only hot n juicy. My overall experience was pleasant.
