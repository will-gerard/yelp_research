This place sucks!!! Joe Baselice is an incompetent moron....at least thats the only conclusion I can come to since we never got to speak to him in 6 years. This office is a nightmare of incompetence. They will screw up your paperwork causing you penalty....they will ignore your phone calls......they will not return phone calls as they say they will. They are unapologetic and unprofessional. They overcharged when we added a second vehicle to our insurance plan so badly that they cost us over $120.00 in overdraft fees. Because of this the bank actually reversed those charges but farmers will now be seeing us in small claims court after they decided to short us again of a couple hundred dollars  when they finally sent our refund for the time paid after cancellation. We had great service for 16 years in Northern Arizona with farmers Insurance but the crap we have endured from Joe Baselice and his Farmers office has been an abject failure completely caused by this offices work practices....or lack thereof. We contacted Liberty Mutual and spoke with Tim Allen directly....within half an hour we had a new plan with better coverage and a savings of over $1200.00 a year. We had some follow up questions and again it was Tim Allen himself who spoke with us....not a know nothing desk girl....who is probably chewing gum and twisting her hair with her finger.  See you in court Joe.

I won playing Blackjack. I won playing Poker. I won playing Keno. I even won playing Penny Slots. The Grand Buffet tastes great when your wallet is as fat as mine got here.  Had I lost money this place would get one star. Just so you know what  the Casino itself is like. I just cant bring myself to do a shit review for a place that made me a months salary in less than 6 hours.

I know what you're thinking. 5 stars for Harrahs?? Are you on the pipe muthafucker. That answer is yes but it still doesn't deter me from dropping 5 stars on Harrahs. I can stay at Harrahs anytime for $48.00 a night because of my brothers employee discount. Last visit to Harrahs was in March and we stayed 5 days in a really clean, nice, well equipped two room suite with a frickin beautiful view for $267.00. Harrahs has been a fixture in Vegas since almost the very beginning and it seems to stick to it's old school roots in which it was born. Of all the places I can choose to stay in Vegas on the cheap there's no place like Harrahs. Their is something to be said for unloading the previous days buffet while smoking a cigarette and catching ESPN Sportscenter while deciding whether the day is going to involve gambling, drinking, or both. Word to the wise: If you want a challenging card game you will get it at Harrahs. Those old timers are no joke. Thanks for the poker lesson gentlemen.

Being saddled with a 10 and 12 year old on a Friday night in Vegas can be a challenge if you want everyone to remain happy. Thankfully the Suncoast was more than accommodating. The Bowling Alley is clean and fun and everyone had a good time ,kids as well as adults. Then for some adult time at the tables we set the kids up with the designated chaperone and off to the in-house movie theater for them and off to the craps table for some of the adults.  It's part of the Coast casino chain and as most of them the casino areas aren't the greatest but they are more than adequate. Overall a good place for young and old to stay occupied for the better part of the day.They got me for almost $600.00 bucks but I'll be looking to get that back after work somewhere today.

I'm pretty lucky for the fact I love Vegas and I have some really great family and friends that live here and get me super cheap rooms at any number of strip hotels. You cant believe how cheap employees can rent rooms at strip hotels. I love paying less than $80.00 for a $200.00  room with all the amenities. The Flamingo is a great place for gambling, dining, and drinking. Somehow everytime we stay at the Flamingo we end up in Margaritaville downstairs right across from Caesar's getting just monkey-shined shitfaced and knowing the inevitable "technicolor yawn" will be coming shortly after we hit that 4:00 a.m. buffet somewhere. The Flamingo Garden is a great little area to stroll through and get some nice pictures. The hotels location makes it easy to head out and access the strip. Vegas Baby.

It's not often you see Eggs Benny on a buffet menu but they do a great Eggs  Benny here. Impressive breakfast buffet people.It's my last few hours here in sweltering LV and I'm pretty bummed about it. The food was pretty much excellent as well as the service. If I could dock the place a star for the incredibly rude customers who feel the need to push  and prod their way into the buffet line whenever they see something they like I would but it just doesn't seem fair to the establishment. It's called a buffet LINE fucktards. Not a buffet your fucking  over sized ass into any spot that strikes your fancy. Fucking waffles aren't going anywhere you fat bastard in the Las Vegas Speedway t-shirt.  Hit the line knowing that ignorant fucks are going to be jockeying for position and you  will have a great time.

Within seconds of finally getting my brother moved into his new house. My first question is "where's the nearest  casino"?   My brother said "Red Rock, five minutes east".  Me: WTF??? Lets get going dude. LIKE NOW!!  Him: Don't you want to take a shower first?  Me: Do I stink?  Him: No but you're kinda dusty and haggard looking.  Me: Fuck you, this is my look.... I call it the "too old to give a rat's ass look", you don't approve?  Him: Do I have a choice?  Me: No now lets FUCKING GO. I have exactly 6 hours before I have to head to the airport.  And that is how I got to check out the Red Rock. Nice fuckin place. I was kinda dirty yes but I fit in pretty well. Seems like a locals place. Maybe because it's so far off the strip. Maybe it's the time we went (early Monday). Lot's of  clueless Texas hold em players. Cocktail waitresses are quick as bunnies... which got me to thinkin "I wonder if they fuck like bunnies to" yet I digress. Thanks for you're hard earned money bitches.This place would rate 4 stars whether I won or lost. Others won't be so lucky in future reviews.

Okay the ratio here between seven and eleven a.m. of geriatric motorized oxygen tank toting smokers is easily 2:1 over any other group of any kind. I noticed this one morning when I was trying to decide between tequila sunrises or bloody marys to ease the transition from the bourbon and waters I had been consuming the previous 12 hours. I plopped my drunk ass between 2 previously stated geriatrics at a dollar machine and slid my little paper ticket into the machine .....repeatedly......like over and over and over. I ask Miss Nebraska 1946 on my right if she had any problems to which she coughs a raspy "not me". That's when Miss Idaho 1939 looks at my voucher and says "that voucher is for Bally's this is Ceasar's".  DOHHH!!! I went back to Ballys and subsequently straight to bed.  You had to be there.

This is Vegas as it was in it's beginnings. Rustic and charming with great steaks and a feel as if you could expect Frank, Dean and Sammy to walk through the place at any moment. I just loved the ambiance here and hated that our evening came to an end. The food, quality drinks, and excellent service were rivaled only by the fantastic view that is offered.  This was my first time at The Steakhouse but I am definitely putting it on my Vegas rotation list for great dining. I wanted to take the exterior glass elevator but it was closed down due to maintenance so I have to scratch one star. Pricey? YES. Worth it? OH HELL YES.

Well Kevin after years I have finally found your scumbag con artist ass. This so called "website developer" is a thief of the highest order. He was recommended by a friend who was also in the computer business and this work was to be done for my boss. Once getting my boss in contact with Kevin and before any payments were made Kevin came off as intelligent and easily approachable about problems as well as easily contacted. After multiple promises of work to be done and sending back and forth of paperwork and several thousand dollars we get some semblance of a web site working 11 months later...now mind you its non operational but it is barely functioning....after more talks with Kevin and several thousand more dollars this piece of shit fuckhead falls off the face of the earth. Takes the money and runs so to speak. Stops responding to calls and emails. Changes phone numbers after a few months....new contact information is found and he answers the call SURPRISE!!. Well he is apologetic and professional sounding and says he will get right back to us ....SURPRISE SURPRISE!!!! that cowardly fuck falls off the earth again. Well Kevin Taylor of KT Graphics we got your sorry ass now......social media has found you in vegas and operating again....stand by for the coming subpoena....as they say...."SEE YOU IN COURT".

Spacious rooms at a bargain rate + cocktail waitresses that are faster than Olympic class sprinters + the guy throwing the dice at the craps table who helped me win $2100.00 in 45 minutes x 20 smiling laughing partying revelers around the craps table = 5 Fucking stars for Ballys. Thanks for bankrolling my next trip.

Wow what a fucking great place to waste hard earned money. Maybe I'm bitter because I could never afford the shit they sell in the shops here but I have to admit it was a blast (literally a blast of damn cold air from the AC)strolling through the gaudiness and garish statues and marble columns and plastic titted cougars who are shopping in places ten years past they're prime by the ass load. I did look at a nice Citizen Eco-drive wristwatch and the guy told me with a straight face that it was  $2700.00. Unfortunately I did not maintain a straight face when I said, " you have GOT to be shitting me, for that price it better eco drive my ass to the airport after my trip". Watch douche wasn't amused with my admittedly lame attempt at humor.       But hey he's got a job to do so who the fuck am I to bust his chops. This is a great place to shop if you have way more money than brains. When I have that kind of money I'll be back.
