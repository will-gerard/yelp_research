Customer service was horrible. They lost a $700 sale because the Guy behind the counter was a dick.

Booked on priceline through "Name your own price". Got it for $45 per night for three nights. (Because I needed a decent room to sleep at night, not a fan of roach motels.)   This was all great. Until a $19 per day fee was added to my bill. Front Desk Manager was a prick about it, I didn't use any of the services included in this "Resort Fee" such as "Free Wi-Fi" and "Complimentary Coffee". Someone there needs to re-evaluate how they use the words "Free" and "Complimentary".  The resort isn't really great either. Seems like anyone can get a 4 star rating. I've stayed at better holiday inns.  Also,  If you're a big fan of thin walls and hearing everything the people in the halls and rooms next to you are doing and saying, this is the place for you.  Overall, I wouldn't stay here if I could avoid it. I'm not a fan of being treated like an idiot by hotel/resort staff.

Best Mexican food in the Phoenix Area. Can't go wrong with Chicken Fajita Mexican Pizza.

Went for the Video Games, was surprised by the great food. Definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of Pizza and Games.

The food has a great homemade quality to it. Definitely try the Gorditas. Atmosphere could use some work, and the neighborhood is not the best, but the food is worth the trip.
