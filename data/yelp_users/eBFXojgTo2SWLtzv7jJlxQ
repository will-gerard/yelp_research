QUALITY QUALITY QUALITY! That is what makes this place great! They understand that good quality ingredients don't need too much to be delicious.  That is the basic principal of REAL Italian cooking and they get it. The food is simple but delicious. Everything is fresh. My favorite? The Tuna Sandwich with Arugula on fresh bread.  Simple. Delicious. Perfect.

It is restaurant week and we finally went and had a good experience.  First- I like that it is BYOB, we got to bring a great bottle of french wine and not pay the mark up but simply a $10 corkage (however, next time I will bring my own glasses, not a fan of thick glass wine glasses). For appetizers we had the tomato goat cheese tart and mussels. They were both very tasty. For the main course we had the lamb shank and the chilean sea bass. The lamb shank was fall of the bone tender and wonderfully flavorful - the sea bass on sea bean salad was really really good- very well composed and balanced. The desserts were very good too - Hadden liked the peanut butter chocolate the best and I like the Brown Butter Peach.  Good food, nice intimate but casual setting. This is a definite Phoenix must-try and a great date spot.

I used to go to Optical Expressions in Scottsdale but this location is more conveniently located for me. I am giving a 5 star mostly because of Tracy. She works in the front and helps you pick your lenses or contacts, does lens training, and answers ANY questions you may have. I have been going to this location for about a year now and every time I go in, she is so helpful and kind. She always remember my name and never seems bothered, even when I try on 100 glasses or needed a second contact lens training. I would recommend this optometrist but make sure after your eye exam you deal with Tracy =)

I LOVE jewelry and more importantly, I know jewelry.  I believe in being an educated consumer especially when it comes to something as subjective and detailed as jewelry. I have several friends in the wholesale diamond business and have done some work in the industry myself. I researched countless hours and the costumer service, value and over all experience kept bringing me back to Hyde Park at Biltmore. I remember walking in there for the first times several years ago just to look. From that time everyone that worked in the store was kind, helpful and approachable. It came time to pick out an engagement ring and I am so so so happy with my experience. Terri Hammer is the associate that I worked with and she was so delightful. She cared about what I wanted and our budget. You cannot beat the personal customer service or the diamond prices at any other jeweler that I have found. I couldn't even get the same prices or personal service through wholesalers. I have not received my ring yet, but I am very anxious. I HIGHLY recommend Hyde park to anyone on the market for any type of jewelry, specifically engagement rings.  Thank you so much for the great experience, you have a customer for life!!

I have a major sweet tooth and am VERY picky about my sugary calorie intake =) I usually go to tammy co or make birthday cake's myself (i come from a mother that was a phenomenal baker), but it was my boyfriends 30th so I wanted something special, different, yummy and reasonably priced. I am SO SO SO happy that people suggested this place! WOW! Thank you Barb's bakery! The cake looked so beautiful, just what I wanted and everyone raved about the cake and how delicious it was! I ordered a marble cake with raspberry mouse filling and buttercream icing... every bite was wonderful!  Thank you for making my boyfriends cake so perfect for his special day!

LGO is a great little brunch/lunch spot and they are pet friendly on their patio, which I and my Sparkle love! :-)  I would like to start with the food, after all, that is what Yelp is actually for, right? LGO has great salads and sandwiches and I like their friday night free wine tastings. My favorite salad is the kale salad (however I have noticed the amount of actual kale over the last several months has gotten smaller) but very fresh, delicious and nutritious. Their Ruben is really good too! :-) Also, if your in for a sweet treat, their sugar cookies are fabulosity, really, just take my word for it! On to the actual ambiance and um, I guess you can call it customer service. Very hipster/ California vibe (which is to be expected since the original started in CA). As for the people that work there... I must say if you are going somewhere to get stellar service or to get a warm hearted hello or welcome, or really even be treated like a human, 95% chance that will NOT happen at LGO. I go there a lot and have a lot of friends that do and we all agree on one thing thing, great food but nasty, mean, bitchy employees that treat you as though you are an inconvenience for even being there. I have actually turned around and left before, and have avoided going there because I didn't feel like being treated as a 12th class citizen. If they could fix that issue, it would make the whole experience much more enjoyable. But hey,  you can always call ahead and get it to go. All in all though, good place :-)

I do not understand how this restaurant has such high rating anywhere! I am Italian and LOVE good Italian food and make it homemade myself... I took my boyfriend to Marcellino for his Birthday and was thoroughly disappointed in almost EVERYTHING!  First, on a positive note, it is a beautiful location and great atmosphere... Perfect for a romantic date. Second, the negative... I do not know how they managed to make a salad taste bad, but they did... It tasted bitter and bland and lacking any real preparation. Then their pasta... There was no flavor or depth or excitement at all! I don't know about you, but Italian food is supposed to warm you from the inside out and fulfill all your senses from sight to smell and of course taste! When we finished the meal, the waiter asked us how it was, and I told him I really was not impressed and disappointed after expecting something much more. He quickly got defensive and proceeded to quote all the "awards" and "ratings" they have received and when I mentioned I was Italian, he said the food I was used to but be from a different region. He was rude and un-accommodating.  I have no problem paying $20-$30 per plate, but only if there is quality to back it up. Do not waste your time or money if you are anticipating FABULOUS Italian food, but if you don't mind paying for a nice atmosphere and mediocre, overpriced food, then Marcellino might be your place.

We were invited here with some friends and the food and drinks and service were alright.They were not terrible, but not worth going back for. Just very cheesy and greasy and I am sure a fat and calorie bomb!

I really had a great experience with Optical Expressions.  The Doctor was proficient and really seemed to know what he was doing.  What really made my experience great though was the very sweet lady MIla (I think that is how you spell it). She is a pretty European blonde woman and is so professional, kind, helpful and just really pleasant to deal with. She went out of her way to help me get the lenses that I wanted- Optical Expressions really has a gem with her. The other front office staff was friendly and helpful as well.  The selection of glasses is mainly made up of designer labels, so it can be a little pricey. I ended up with a pair of Versace glasses that I LOVE! I would recommend this shop to anyone- I will be returning there myself.

Ugh! I took a friends recommendation, unfortunately. This is NOT good pizza, I have no clue how this has 4 stars on yelp. I am assuming cause it is in Tempe (a college town).  We ordered a 16" half pizza blanco - half supreme.  First, the Pizza Blanco - It was bland and they said it was fresh cheese, well, I don't know how. There was nothing to it, I had to add every spice at the table to get anything out of it and didn't eat a whole piece. Then, the supreme - This was slightly more edible, but I promise you, if I closed my eyes, I would think I was eating a supreme pizza from Costco. Again, the cheese was NOT fresh or at least not fresh and of quality. Then the crust, I didn't eat it, I ate the toppings of the supreme only, because it was flavorless had no depth or crunch at all. And I only ate it because i was hungry. The service is sub par and don't expect them to go out of your way or seem happy to serve you.  Now, if you are like a lot of these reviewers, you might like it. But if you like quality good food with flavor and depth, and don't eat pizza and empty calories without thinking about it, you will thank me that you skipped this place.  This is simply not good food, not good quality and not a true representation of good New York style pizza.

Best tailor in town. Phil is one of a kind and has a great sense of humor and sarcasm (don't be offended, he can come of harsh at first but you will learn to love him) =) They are reasonable and their seamstresses are rock stars. If you need your clothes in a hurry, just bug Phil a little and they will get it done. They do it all... Men's suits, pants, shirts... Women's dresses, pants, gowns, swim suits, etc... We would not trust our clothing to anyone else. A piece of advice, park in the parking lot just South of Zizzo, it is a lot easier to get in and out of!

YUMMY! Quality and Simplicity are what make great Italian Food, they have those two important factors down! Their sandwiches are delicious! The meats they have are par to non int the city. One of my favorite sandwiches is the 'Capacollo , Hard Salami & Provolone' on their outrageously wonderful white italian sub roll! I usually go for wheat, but I make the exception here, it is worth it!!  They are also a great Italian grocer for all your Italian, fresh pasta, pizza dough, wine, italian goods, etc... The prices are reasonable and you won't be disappointed! This is truly a little Italian gem in the desert. and very casual and low key, but delicious! I highly recommend Defalco's! P.S The wait wait can sometimes be long, but it is worth it! If you are in a hurry, CALL AHEAD!

If you look up the antonym to hipster you will find my photo. We were referred here by our awesome waiter Matt at the Henry for drinks.  It was a Saturday night, about 10 pm and my boyfriend and I went dressed up (NY standard, not PHX standards) like we usually are to go out and needless to say the minute we stepped foot inside I felt a little out of place. But we forged through the coffee area to the back bar area. We found two cozy seats and were greeted. I have to say although I look very different then anyone working there and most people going there they were all very nice to us and helpful (which I cannot say of all "hipster joints" *cough* Cartel *Cough*).  If you like a great cocktail and even to challenge your palate, You HAVE to go hear! They have all quality liquors and mixers and to make it even better, there is NO cocktail menu. They can make all the classics, but the fun part is telling them what you like and don't like in a drink and they will create fabulous concoction just for you! I am talking rose water, lavender, all kinds of herbs and unique flavor profiles and combinations. To make it better, the prices are reasonable! To get a fabulous hand-made cocktail with all top shelf and beyond liquors for $8-$10 is a great deal and  they don't use ice and "fillers" to cut you short, with a couple drinks you will feel, let's say, relaxed... Now the Mac-n-cheese with Bacon and Jalapenos!!! YES! It is perfect. Great comfort food, you may feel guilty for having consumed all that fat BUT it is totally worth it and you will love every moment of it! Their baked goods and coffee are also great. The music however... I have been there when they played the whole collection of Metallica (Lord, help me)... It isn't always that awful, however I don't care for the music most restaurants play today, so I digress.  I have already brought a few people and suggested it to a few others.... this is a must try! I tell you what, hipsters know their cocktails, coffee and food.

Hipster is an understatement, but I learned to see past that and the "interesting" people really quick! After my first bite of the Filet-o-Fish and their sweet potatoes fries with that oh so addicting curry mayonnaise! Yum! I have also had their summer shrimp salad, steak salad, fish tacos and several other things. All delicious! I have figured out that no matter what I order, the chef behind the menu knows his food! They really understand how to create depth and develop flavors.  By the way, their dinner menu is much better than their brunch/lunch menu, so go AFTER 2! Wish their service was a little better, but LOVE their food and would suggest this to anyone and everyone! A Phoenix Must try!

Five stars is truly deserved For Yasu. This is truly the best sushi in town and some of the best I ever had! I am a big seafood lover and there a lot of "chain sushi" places in Arizona that are decent and good for rolls, but if you want quality and authentic Japanese style fish and incredible Sashimi, you need to go to Yasu. There is really no way to describe it till you go, but once you do, you will become an instatnt fan!  Best thing to do is sit at the sushi bar and ask Yasu to make whatever he wants! You won't be disappointed.  The area and building are misleading... However, if you are the kind of person that thinks RA is the best thing since sliced bread and nothing can beat it, this is probably not for you. This is real sushi... Go try and enjoy!

One of my my favorite salads is at the White Chocolate Grill. The Filet Mingon Cobb Salad is FANTABULOUS and DELICIOUS!! Their seasonal Pumpkin Cheesecake is the best cheesecake I have ever eaten and wish they had it all year (except I would gain a few pounds). Their other food is also very tasty, great service and ambiance!  Not a place for groups though, they only have booths...  highly recommend you try White Chocolate Grill though... It's fabulous!

My boyfriend and I try to eat very healthy and were in the area and hungry for dinner. We saw Zoe's  kitchen and thought we would give it a try... The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the girl at the counter was pretty friendly. The food however was bland and terribly unimpressive. I had the Chicken Roll-ups and they were cold, pre-made and lacking in any culinary skill what so ever.  When I ordered them I asked if i could get spinach instead of lettuce and she said they are pre-made every morning so I can't change anything... Also, They claim to be a "healthy alternative" and they ONLY have white flour tortillas and do not offer wheat. In my fruit salad there were 2 ROTTED grapes and when my boyfriend showed them they said "oh, ok, sorry" then went back to whatever they were doing...  Honestly, there are many better alternatives to go to and spend $7-$10 a plate... I do not recommend going there at all

First, I would like to rate the cooking classes... which I would give 3 stars. I signed up for a couple classes when they went on sale (50% off) a few weeks ago... Well, I am not a beginner and unfortunately most of the people in the class didn't even know how to cut an apple or onion properly. The chefs were VERY NICE but the kitchen is so small that most everything is not hands on and you just stand there and watch other people do a few things or the chef does it themselves, so you could just watch food network and get the same effect. If you are a real beginner and don't spend much time in the kitchen this would be a great place for classes  because you would get more comfortable in the kitchen, but if you are an avid cook like I am, there is really no benefit at all to taking these classes. I took 2 (knife skills and french pastry) and honestly I learned nothing and ended up helping other people in the class. As for the store, the staff are all very friendly and helpful. Also, the prices of their everyday kitchen tools are not much higher then shopping elsewhere and they have a great variety of many basic things. They also have great specialty items, linens, dishes, etc... When you buy things online you can return them to the store with ease, and their customer service phone line is great! Sur La Table is a great shopping experience and if you are an avid cooker or just beginning I highly suggest stopping in... but beware or you'll end up like me with great gadgets and no where to store them =)

We finally stopped in for happy hour and we sat at the bar (because all the decent bar tables were "reserved"). The prices are high, even for happy hour but the food is pretty good.  The best things we ordered (we got 2) was the Roast Duck & Kimchi Udon ($9 on HH and $11 regular). That dish rocks... I wish they sold a meal portion. The Beef Yakiniku Skewer with Sweet Garlic Glaze is ok but nothing special. The Flame Seared Sesame Salmon Nigiri (4pc) was not the best I have had but good.  Scallop and Seafood Ceviche Taco was really Delicious and although only $2, it is the smallest taco I have ever seen in my life. The drinks are good, their martinis are tasty and they will muddle any fresh fruit or herb in it for you.  The atmosphere is beautiful and the bartenders and servers are really nice.  I will go back for happy hour- this would be a fun place to meet friends.

Great place for Breakfast/Brunch.  We go often and enjoy their breakfast sandwich. it is reasonably priced and delicious. Also their french toast is just divine!! And save room for that beyond wonderful fluffy buttery almond croissant. But make sure to ask for it at the beginning of the meal, because they are often out and you will have to ask them to put however many you want in the oven. They also have a beautiful pastry case. The service is alright, very "trendy" girls that work there, not overly sweet or accommodating by any means, but they do their job. Would I recommend this place? Yes (but I have not eaten lunch or dinner here, when I do, i will update my review)

The AJ's GRILL at THIS Location ROCKS!! They have something that differs them from anyone, and that is STEPH behind the grill! For about $5 you get a delicious, good quality, perfectly cooked to order hamburger or turkey burger. It is a little bit of a drive (for us) but it is a  well worth one and it's not unusual to see Hadden and me there! You must try, I promise, you'll be hooked! Also, conveniently it is part of AJ's so you can run in and grab a drink, sides or dessert...

I have been a member of Massage Envy for about 9 years now... I have been to several locations as I have a moved a few times and usually find the location closest to me.  I hate to give this location such a low rating because the front desk staff are usually  nice but I have had more issues with their front desk and scheduling then anyone should have to deal with. Not all the massage therapists are good, there are only a couple and I am very specific when I request someone... I have been scheduled with the wrong person 3 different times. I have been cancelled on or put with another therapists or had my time moved (THE DAY OF, usually within 30-60 minutes of my appointment) at least 6 times that I can recall off the top of my head. Then what prompted me to write this is the fact that I went in for a 90 minute massage just yesterday (saturday), I usually get there early enough to check in and out before I go in for my massage. Well, I had a one hour credit from my monthly membership and then there was a 30 minute credit from the last time they messed up my scheduling. The girl at the front desk told me she didn't see it but go ahead and go back and she will take care of it once she finds it... well, she sure did. I looked at my amex online tonight and realized she took the liberty to just charge my credit card on file. That is wrong and unethical of a business to take advantage of the fact that you give them access to your credit card. So BEWARE and check your credit card statement when you go to this location...  That being said, There are a couple good therapists at this location and they are the  reason I come back to this location, well and convenience of location. I understand that this is Massage Envy and not a world class spa, but I still believe that there should be standards and respect for their clients time, money and business.

This Z' Tejas on Tatum and Shea in particular has great staff and THE BEST CHIPS AND SALSA! I love their Salsa Verde and could drink it by the gallon! =) Their Chambord Margarita's are par to none and they have a great Happy Hour for appetizers!  I am not as big of a fan of their entrees and they are slightly high on the caloric side; but It is a fun and laid back place to meet with people or just grab a quick bite or drink!

Ok, so I am a junky for a REAL sandwich or Panini. If you have a good palate and appreciation for fine ingredients, a sandwich can be a real treat! So to my point, I was skeptical when Noca started their lunch time "Nocawhich" but gave in, boy am I happy I did, I already went back! They really put some time and effort into creating perfect balances! They truly take a sandwich and turn it into a culinary masterpiece.  The staff is so friendly and the lunch time chef truly takes his time to create and structure everything he serves!  The Roast Beef Sandwich is like nothing that you have ever tasted before... He finds away to incorporate the perfect balance of every element and every texture.  The Sal D is phenomenal and the Cisco kid, yummy! So, basically EVERYTHING he creates is just, freaking delicious!! Love it, Recommend it, It is our Saturday treat that we always look forward too! :-) PS. Their dinner menu is good too!

So, if you are the kind of person that likes suggestions, I will tell you what to order to save you the trouble of guessing...  An extra large Carne Asada Burrito Add Cilantro. It truly is the best Carne Asada in town... it is lean, non greasy and tasty as can be! There Carne Asada tacos and bean burrito are really good too! As a pointer, the breakfast burrito was no as good, too much eggs and not enough of the good stuff and a little greasy. A great little cozy whole in the wall that makes delicious food!  Everyone I have suggested this to loved it!

My boyfriend and I are big fans of J & G. We love going there for dinner sometimes, but our favorite is there Thursday night happy hour with live music. Paying $9 -$18 a cocktail is worth it there because their mixologist is one of the absolute best in town. Their dinner biscuits are absolutely delicious and served warm. It may be considered pricey, but it is worth it. The wait staff are always friendly and helpful and we have always had a wonderful and pleasant experience! The view at dusk is par to none, Camelback  Mountain is beautiful!

*UPDATE* We have loved J&G a long time but are really disappointed. We loved going there for their fabulous cocktails and I hate to say it but they lost their touch. The last couple times we went we were underwhelmed - the staff was not as knowledgeable or friendly or helpful and the drinks have gone down hill. I don't mind paying $18 for a cocktail when they taste like they USED too. It seems as though they fired the real mixologist- I hope the go back to their old ways because I miss going.

This is a great alternative to the typical butter bomb upscale restaurants around here; because they don't use ANY butter! Every dish they serve is under 475 calories. The food is fresh and tasty. Their salmon salad is delicious. So is their Ahi Tuna salad, and I love the seasonal organic greens and that they only use wild fish.   The mini indulgence desserts are so so so yummy! They are perfect because they are just big enough to fill that sweet tooth but not make you feel sick or guilty. My FAVORITE is the Pecan Pie with the White Chocolate Mouse.   I LOVE that they have a live pianist/singer every night at the bar. The bartenders are very friendly and the atmosphere is classy but not stuffy. They have a good and reasonably priced wine selection. I would recommend this place to people who like a classy atmosphere and tasty healthy good quality food.

Well, I must say I was more than Presently Surprised. My boyfriend and I went there tonight. First,  it was SOOO refreshing to be treated so well by James at the front of house. He was so welcoming and truly a veteran of real fine dining.  Our server was very kind as well. The atmosphere was white linens and not typical of what you would find in Arizona, I liked it.  To the wine, we got a bottle of New Zealand sauvignon blanc that was only $23 there and it was a $20 bottle of wine retail. So there is not really much of a mark up at all. To the foods, $16 for a  3 course dinner. It was a fabulous meal and they are obviously doing a great job with their students, very delicious! It would have easily been 3x as much at any other non student run restaurant. I suggest this place to all of you. It really is a hidden gem! However, you do HAVE to have reservations... sometimes they are a few weeks out because they only do one seating a night.  Thank you Le Cordon Bleu for having this restaurant, it was a real  treat!

What a great studio. The owner Kelly is wonderful, warm and welcoming and a great instructor. The rest of the staff is wonderful too!  The studio is clean and quaint and makes you feel comfortable. The workout is amazing! If you were to just watch you would not think it would burn or do much, but I promise the results are real. It burns! Also, it is as easy or hard as you want to make it.  If you are looking for a good workout that is something you can do forever and are wanting to tone and lift areas you have never  been able to, then you will love Go Figure. I have had wonderful results and enjoy just being at the studio. So happy that my friend Alesha brought me here.

Bink's Midtown is in my opinion the best happy hour in town. Also, one of my favorite chef inspired restaurants here in Phoenix!  Let's see, where do we begin? The french fries with truffle ketchup will change your life. They are the best french you will ever eat! They come with 3 different sauces but I usually just ask for 3 truffle ketchup's =) Their Mussels in curry broth with fresh focaccia are AMAZING!!!  The Bacon Cheese Burger has the Bacon INSIDE the Patty!! It is finger licking good! The sloppy Joe will change your opinion on sloppy joes... in a good way! ALL their local produce and salads are DELICIOUS!!! I could go on and on.... The food will not disappoint you. It is flavorful, fresh and very well thought out.  The wine list is equally as good! They have a fairly small but incredibly picked wine list. They are also not over priced. Even their 'house wine' Vine Capsule is delicious and only $5 a glass ($2.50 on Happy Hour) However, Purple Hands Pinot Noir is my favorite.  The staff is so kind, attentive and helpful. I would name them all, but we have been there a lot and have had a great experience every time. The General Manager is Oscar, what a great guy!! They got lucky finding him.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Bink's Midtown! You will not be disappointed.  Cheers!

Not all Whole Foods are alike - this one is great! I am so glad they built this just 5 minutes from my house because I don't care for the location on Tatum and Shea.  The wok bowl station rocks! A great deal for $8!  Their orange chicken is delicious - their juice bar is great - the sandwiches they make are tasty. Their produce is really great- mostly organic and local and a lot of variety and some specialty items. They also have a great bulk foods section that is reasonably priced. The staff are usually really helpful and friendly. The "restaurant/bar" in the front corner of the store is surprisingly good as well. Great draft beers and their turkey burger is awfully yummy. If you haven't been to THIS Whole Foods, take a stop by sometime.

WOW!!!! I am so impressed and can hardly believe this is a Fox concept. Most his restaurants are good, but this is GREAT! The food, drinks, atmosphere AND service are all excellent and come together to make a truly fabulous experience. We live 2 minutes from The Henry and kept wanting to go and decided to drop in tonight for my boyfriends birthday... It is Saturday, it was 9:15 pm and we had about a 10 minute wait.  We started with cocktails- I got the Fig & Ginger Mule and he got the Old Fashioned. They were both wonderful... It was so nice to have a drink in a restaurant that was balanced and perfect. Finding well mixed cocktails is not that easy in this city... For dinner I had the Wild Mushroom Tortelli and he had the roasted turkey french dip. The Tortelli was fabulous- the sauce was flavorful and the textures in the dish were so balanced. The Turkey dip - OMG! Seriously, I don't know what they did to this turkey, but there was so much flavor packed into it it my tastebuds were dancing.  Then we moved onto desert (we rarely get dessert, but couldn't resist after the outstanding meal) The Warm Croissant Bread Pudding- let's just say, it was worth every calorie! Our server Matthew- it has been a long time since I have had really great service, it was so refreshing to be helped by someone who you can tell loves what he does. He was knowledgable, kind, helpful and just an all around great person. Thank you for this one Sam Fox! You hit the nail on the head...

Wendy is the best!! I have done pageants a long time... I am also a signed commercial model/talent- so believe me I have had a spray tan or two. She is a sweetheart, professional and makes you feel so comfortable. Her products are top of the line and they don't smell "chemically" like other tanning products. The color she uses is gorgeous and she can go as dark or as light as you want (depending what you are doing it for). If you need a tan for on stage especially, Wendy is THE go to person in the valley... Her stage tans look flawless and natural on stage and she doesn't miss an inch. ;) Also, her prices are fair and competitive.... I highly recommend her!
