Your local neighborhood coffee shop!  With locally roasted coffee.  Marie behind the counter (the owner) is always waiting with a warm smile and a 'hello'.    I go most mornings for my Caff√® Americano and see the same people in the same seats.  can you say following or community.  Yes, they also have WiFi.  This is always a plus+!.

I agree with everyone else you do not go to this place for the decor you go for the food.  My wife LOVES Chinese food and could eat it every night.  This is one of a hand full of places that she will get take out from.  The Moo Shu is some of the best i have ever had.  I mean better then the stuff i remember eating back on the east coast growing up and that is hard to do.

I stay away for chain restaurants for a reason and my recent dinner only confirmed that.  Food-bland and inconsistent from person to person.  Wait staff - sucked and no effort I will not be going back.

I only like to eat pizza two places on the valley and mamma mia is one of them.  But this place makes more then good pizza.    The Penne Vodka is some of the best in town.    Eggplant Parm is also rocking!  It also make a great lunch or quick dinner how can you beat 2 slices and a drink for $3.50.  The Arcadia location is small and seating is limited.  About 6 seats inside and at most 12 outside.  Making takeout a better option.

I was hoping that the revamp would make Radio Cafe on par with its sibling across the street (LGO).   I am sorry to say, NO.   The menu to split between sushi and what they call bar food.  The sushi was good but not great and the bar food was not really bar food.    My wife and i split the following: Bar Food: EDAMAME - good, this is hard to mess up RADIO CHOPPED SALAD - the best thing i eat, no protein and expensive RAISINBREAD GRILLED CHEESE - sounds a bit strange but somehow is all does work together (in a a odd type of way)  Sushi: SPICY TUNA - good tuna, very dry rice SWEET POTATO - to sweet and the texture was just all soft

I am always looking for a good "simple" breakfast place. No big menu, small little place, nice people. I think i may have found it.  The poached eggs where cooked to perfection.

I got a few quotes on Sun Screen and no one beat the prices and turn around time.   From order to install in 5 days and for much less then the closes competitor.  Also, NO money up front.  I paid in full after the job was completed.  Robert was great to work with!
