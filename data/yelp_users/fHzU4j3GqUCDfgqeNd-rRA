I cam here for lunch and here is a summary of my experience: Pros: - Service was good. Cons: - Food was terrible. - Focaccia bread wasn't fresh.. At least a day old.  - I ordered an eggplant involtini.. It was salty, most likely microwaved, the eggplant looked and tasted like it was made the day before, and the cheese stuffing was cold.  I won't recommend this place to anyone. If it wasn't for the service I would've given it 1 star.

This is without a doubt the worst Chinese restaurant I've been to my entire life. As soon as we walked in the place reeked of old frying oil smell. I knew it was gonna be bad after that smell invaded my nose.  We order chicken curry wings as an appetizer which was horrible. Frozen wings dumped in an old frying oil then mixed with an awful tasting curry sauce!! And the potato steak fries that was mixed with the wings and the sauce was frozen and cold.  We also ordered sweet and sour chicken entree and crispy duck entree. Both are horrible, the sweet and sour chicken was below average at best and the crispy duck was definitely not fresh and I'm pretty sure it was reheated multiple times.  We didn't eat the white rice as it had a very bad smell besides being very dry.  It was a waste of time and money.  I strongly advise against going to this place.

Let me say at first that I went to this place a few days ago and this was my first and last visit to that place. I completely REGRET going there. Not because of the money but for what the DID to my car.  I brought in my 2013 black Audi for a VIP wash. I elected to go with the hand-wash because I was afraid the automatic wash would scratch the paint.  I also told the guy that took my car that I have micro-fiber brushes and  towels that I want them to use and he said yeah sure I'll tell the guys to use them.  Well, Here is how it went: 1- They hosed my car with water in the open under the heat of the AZ sun!!!! End results: the sun dried the water leaving plenty of WATER SPOTS in my car!!!!  2- I opened my trunk after they were done and found my micro-fiber brushes and towels UNUSED. instead they used those red-rags that filled my car with swirl marks.. my car looks awful.. it's freckin horrible..  If you weren't gonna use my towels why on earth did you say you would!!! HAd I known they would use they're crappy scratch-maker towels I would've driven away and not left my car in the hands of careless people who could give a sh*t about one's car.  I WILL NEVER GO TO THAT PLACE AGAIN. IF YOU HAVE A NICE CAR THAT YOU SPENT THOUSANDS ON, DON'T RUIN IT BY BRINGING IT TO THIS PLACE.  Now I have to get my car clayed to get rid of the water spots and puffed to get rid of most of the swirl marks (not all of them) which will cost me over $250!!!!!!!!  I'm so disappointed and very regretful for brining my car to this place. NEVER AGAIN!!

I went to try this steak house restaurant last night for the first time, and here is how i was treated: 1) At first they made me choose between sitting on a small table at the patio right at the entrance where there is a huge traffic or share a high-top table at the bar. I choose the latter. Although there were more than 5 or 6 empty tables in the main dining area. Anyway this wasn't a really big deal. 2) I ordered lamb chops (double) and I told them I want them medium cooked. By the definition on their menu, medium is "Hot center, pink throughout". I was really excited to have my lamb chops especially I was craving them the entire week. Unfortunately, I got my chops very red and very very cold in the center. I told the server to take my two chops back and have them cooked to where the center is warm. To my surprise they sent me back two chops that were a) well done, no pink. b) HALF the size of the original chops. Literally, they were have the size of the original lamb chops or even less!!!! At that point I didn't even bother to complain, I ate the skinny fries and the three small mushrooms and left the chops untouched excepted for the first bite.  Unfortunately, after leaving the restaurant I realized that the only thing I enjoyed having was the drinks and the salad, both they had very little to do with.  I REALLY wanted to have a good experience at this place since it's close to my house.

Place is awesome.. Thumps up to the office staff.. very friendly and professional. Love the effort they put to show their residents how they appreciate them. Lots of residents appreciation weeks, lots of events and prizes.   There's nothing to complain about at all.

I found this place in May 2013. Since then I have been to that place more than ten times. It's a whole different experience of Mexican food!! I never really liked oysters until I tried their Vuelve a la vida oysters. They're a bit pricy but I have come back to this restaurant mainly for them. Their tostadas are great too.  I tried the shrimp and octopus one and it was great. I also tried a creamy shrimp dish, forgot the name of it, and it was awesome! I have also tried a deep friend whole fish and it was great.  Oh and their complimentary ceviche is to die for!!! Finally, you gotta order a michelada, it's a great drink!  The waitresses are really nice. Most of them don't speak English but that makes it even more fun for me to try and practice what I learned from rosetta stone lol.   I totally recommend this place.

This place is a really good place for a bar n grill. The people that work here are nice, friendly and attentive. They are the best aspect of this place. The wood fried pizza is truly a delicacy. I love it.  The only downside i have with this place is two things: 1) lime is always never fresh.. It's tastes and smells like its been cut open for more that 3 days.  2) the chicken wings are never consistent. Mostly i get them smoked with a dryish rub which i definitely love but sone times they are like any low quality wings ( fried and dumped in hot sauce). I don't know if thats just a different cook that make them his/her way but this place should stick to one recipe and have their all cooks follow the same one.
