I don't understand why people would give this place 5 stars, as a matter of fact, I don't understand why people give mediocre places 5 stars.  5 stars is for the best thing you've ever eaten.  This place is no better than any of the other barf-o-berto's.  The parking lot smelled good and gave me hope, but as soon as we walked in, the smell instantly became something comparable to body order.  This place is pretty gross on the inside, about as gross as all the other berto's.  I ordered a #13 chimichanga with carne asada which is $1 extra.  They set the chimi on a bed of lettuce which, anyone with any sense would know, caused the lettuce to start weeping it's water out into the container.  So my chimi was going for a lettuce water swim.  We also got the two beef tacos, which were advertised as $5 on Monday special, but were charged full price anyway.  The cashier was not friendly, not unfriendly either, just kinda there.  We won't be coming back here.

When I want a cheesesteak, this is where I go.  There's usually a line, but it moves very quickly and the food comes out just as fast.  I've tried about every variation of sandwich you can try there and it's always been consistently great.  The employees are super friendly.  The fry sauce is good if you like sweet sauces.  The fries are good, just a little salt and whatever sauce you like and they are crispy and break up the heaviness of the steak.  I kind of like the cheese fries, but they get soggy and cold fast, so go at them right away!  I always know I see a regular when they're at a table with their fry sauces and other toppings all lined up and ready to go before they've even gotten their food.  The look of anticipation on their faces is always obvious, no matter how hard they try to look cool.  If you're in the area and want to try something new, something you won't find anywhere else near there, try this place.  Sometimes it gets full, so grab a table as soon as you see one, or you may have to sit outside.  Start with a regular cheesesteak before going for broke with the large.  I've never been able to finish a large and I'm a big boy.  Tip: try the tomato bisque, it seems out of place in a cheesesteak joint, but it's amazing.

Amazing! I'm a big fan of pistachio ice cream. This place by far has the best I've had in my life! I got a double scoop in a waffle cone, which was more like three scoops! There must have been an entire bag of WHOLE pistachios in my scoops!  I've never had pistachio ice cream with whole pistachios. The waffle cone was really good, a bit porous letting the melting ice cream ooze out, but I knew that meant it was hand made! I didn't mind the mess at all. People complaining about the staff need to calm down a bit. It's mostly high school students, so I'm not sure how much personality to expect. The person who served me seemed to be the owner, super nice guy. Even asked me and my family how our day was going so far. The only reason our wait was long was due to the large Spanish speaking family whose orders were being translated by a 9 year old girl who isn't old enough to understand others are waiting. I didn't care, gave us more time to view all the flavors. Maybe, my tiny gripe is the ingredients aren't listed for the flavors. But, read a few other yelp reviews before going, and you'll figure the flavors out.  Or better yet, go to their website before going. Glad we found this place and will be back soon!

Best Chicago dog in town.  The prices are unbeatable.  I love their fries as well.  The double dog is very interesting and fun to eat if you like getting messy.  I like the Chicago dog so much, I haven't tried many other variants, except the chili cheese dog...amazing!  They deliver also, even early in the morning, so no matter when you're craving hot dogs, you can call in your order and pick it up, or have them deliver!  They have, I think either weekly or monthly special dogs that they don't always offer.  My favorite special is the jumbo dog.  It's a Chicago dog with a super jumbo Vienna dog.  All the employees are friendly, each table has a bottle of malt vinegar, salt and ketchup (if you're weird enough to put ketchup on ANYTHING).  I would vote to abolish the ketchup altogether, but I'll let them keep it for the little kids and strange adults who still eat ketchup.  Finally, the most important thing I appreciate about this place is the consistency.  You get the same dog and fries every time, there is no fluctuation in quality.  It's great every time and I've been there at least two dozen times.

Very good! I ordered the gyro entrée that came with gyro meat on a bed of yellow rice, with pita bread and a Greek salad. It was around ten bucks which I found to be a very fair price. The feta cheese on the salad was by far the best I've had. Usually, I just sort of deal with feta on my salad, but this was really tasty. Nice and salty without the odd bitter blue cheese notes of most feta. The food came out quickly, and the staff are all very nice. I found myself in tolleson by accident and yelp led me here. I would be back if I'm ever in the area again, but I'm sad to say that the drivers in the area of tolleson are nincompoops. The restaurant itself is small but clean and I had no problem finding a seat. Try them out if you're in the area and don't mind dealing with insane traffic.

I read all these rave reviews about how good their sauce is.  It's too bad I didn't get to try it...  I ordered delivery via Grub Hub today and I'm pretty irked.  I understand that Grub Hub deliveries take a bit longer than your normal pizza delivery, but this was the worst experience ever with delivery.  I was able to watch my order go through all of the steps after I ordered about $50 worth of food including the tip (which I now regret doing) for myself and a coworker.  Our delivery driver was Kevin, if you get Kevin, hunker down and get ready to wait an additional hour just for delivery.  I watched for a good 20 minutes while his car did not move on the map, to the point where I was wondering if the map was even working.  Finally he began moving "toward" my location, but then quickly started to clearly get lost.  He drove around my building several times, making wrong turns, as if GPS is not a thing easily available in 2016.  When he arrived, his car sat in the parking lot on the map for another ten minutes before he FINALLY called me to tell me he was at security.  I had left instructions to deliver at my lobby and exactly where to go, and it was not "go to security".  He also got my name wrong to add insult to injury.  I told him where to go and then waited another TEN MINUTES while he got back in his car and drove to the right place.  We're talking about 100 yards here.  Not a giant complex.  He finally found me and I was displeased to see he was covered in sweat and driving with his windows rolled down, midday in the AZ heat. This meant, everything that should be cold, like coleslaw, was grossly warm, and everything that was supposed to be warm, like french fries and onion strings were cold and soggy from the breeze blowing in the window right into the bag sitting on his front seat.  Long story short, it is just under 5 miles door to door from Dickey's to my lobby and it took over an hour to get here in what should have taken 20 minutes TOPS.  Unacceptable. He might be a nice guy and all, but shouldn't be delivering food.  Speaking of food, I should probably review that.  From what I can tell, since it was either too cold or too warm, this food could be really good!  I could smell the smoke instantly and it has permeated my shirt and hands, that's a good thing.  Any food that can cover me in smoke like a meat flavored cigarette is fine by me.  All of the meats were very tender, all of the sides had great flavor.  I was able to share with my coworker so we got to try lots of different menu items.  I liked the sausages the most, and the brisket and pulled pork were so good (for being cold and dry).  My favorite side has got to be the green beans.  I'm just super bummed because it was all so beat to death from sitting on a front seat for over an hour.  To put a final fork in this experience, we received no BBQ Sauce in our to go bag.  As one other reviewer noted, how can anyone put all of this BBQ meat into the bag and not think, "hey, they're going to want sauce too".  Nope, nada, zip, zilch on the sauce.  I don't want to assume it was the delivery guy Kevin's onus to put sauce in the bag, but I will anyways.  There are no options on Grub Hub to order a bottle of or a side of or any other version of sauce, so I assume that customers assume they're getting sauce.  If you're ever on Mill Ave., and want some BBQ, I say go for it! Just don't order delivery.  If I'm ever on Mill Ave., which I am NEVER on Mill Ave., and I want to stand in line, I'll go here.  The chances of ordering delivery again are about 2% for fears of getting the same driver and then feeling the fury of KNOWING he's been here before but doesn't remember.  Sorry Dickey.

I teetered between 3 and 4 stars, but I've decided to go with 4 because the good things about this place outnumber the things that kind of irked me.  I've been here maybe 3 or 4 times over the course of about 3 years and it has steadily improved.  I would have given this place 1 star a couple years ago.  I will start with the irks, since the list is small.  The service leaves a little to be desired.  I couldn't help but feel rushed by the waiter/bus boy who took my drink order and rushed again by the waitress/hostess/manager who took my food order.  Both of them were walking away from me before I completed my order.  I asked for a cranberry juice and before I could ask for a water also, he was already walking away.  The same went for the waitress who was walking away as I asked for a side of bacon.  I was checked on a few times, but again, it all kind of felt stilted and rushed.  The food has improved vastly, and since I go to places to eat good food, the occasional terse employee won't ruin it for me.  I'd rather have that than a very friendly waitress bring me garbage.  On my most recent visit, I ordered the chicken fried steak with scrambled eggs and the country potatoes with a side of bacon.  The portions were huge and I could not finish it all.  Everything came out hot and fresh.  The steak was very large and delicious, tons of gravy.  The country potatoes, though not very crispy, had a lot of flavor.  The eggs were good too, it felt like easily 3 eggs.  The biscuit is yummy as well.  It's a little dense as other reviewers note, but still very good and buttery.  The side of bacon was huge, I must have gotten like 5 slices.  The prices are VERY reasonable, I have zero complaints there.  I can go in and get stuffed for a very small amount of money.  I regularly get my truck worked on across the street from this place, and based on my last experience, I'll be making this my main go to place when waiting.

I ordered delivery using GrubHub recently and everything I complained about after my first visit has been corrected.  Everything is delicious and as usual, the portions are huge.  It's hard to resist the urge to have them deliver every day.

This is a great little place!  I came here on a Saturday at about 11:30 am.  I was worried that the place would be packed, but to my surprise, it was fairly empty.  We were seated as soon as we came in.  The decor is very nice and the place is very clean.  My only complaint is that it was very warm in the dining area.  I cooled myself off with my menu and decided on the spicy miso ramen lunch special.  I opted for the tuna roll as my side.  My girlfriend ordered the bento box and spicy tuna roll.  Hers came with a miso soup for starters.  The miso soup came first and I had to resist the urge to ask my girlfriend for a taste, but I knew I'd have my own huge bowl soon enough.  My ramen and sushi came next, and my girlfriends food came right behind that.  I was amazed about how huge the bowl of ramen was and worried if I would be able to finish it.  I tried a little bit of everything from by girlfriend's bento box, and everything was very good.  The beef was tender and flavorful.  Her only complaint was that she wished there was a bit more food, and she's very petite and isn't a huge eater.  I'm sure it would take a few bento boxes to fill up a guy of my size.  The ramen was so good.  It's the first time trying restaurant quality ramen and I'm glad it's more popular and available now.  The spice amount was just right, my nose was running by the time I finished the bowl. And yes, I did finish it.  Since this is my first time, I can't say it's the best I've ever had.  I will try some other places and see how they all stack up.  I was also pleased when the check came.  The lunch specials are very reasonably priced, and usually, when I'm in this area, I spend twice for lunch with my girlfriend.  I hope I'll get to try the Izakaya portion of the menu, since it's one of my favorite types of cuisine.  It's not really close enough to me to try it in the evening, but the next time I am in the area at happy hour time, I will stop here for sure.  I'm pretty envious of people who live in this area considering all of the options they have.  A very strong concentration of really good restaurants.

If you're on McClintock and Elliot and want Mexican food, I could suggest about 8 places better than this one.  Went in after a movie, while wasting time getting my truck worked on across the street.  If you get your car worked on at that place (across the street) on a regular basis, you know, you have lots of time to kill.  I, like most, saw the add at the movie theater for $2 off and got the same bait and switch feeling once we got there.  Who's going to order an entrée right after leaving a movie theater full of popcorn.  I'm sure it's all in the fine print on the screen, but who's reading fine print on a movie screen.  Whatever, it's $2.  The place smelled funny when walking in initially.  Kind of like a bathroom that's been cleansed.  The food is just OK.  The restaurant was empty except us, the waitress was very nice.  The menu said rib eye is an extra $2, but was informed it's actually $4.  My GF loved it, but I don't think she really knows authentic Mexican food.  She ordered the beef tamales lunch special.  I thought the maza was mushy.  Nothing amazing.  I grew up eating tamales from New Mexico, so maybe I'm used to it a certain way.  I ordered the Mexican pizza which was HUGE, especially for the price, even after adding rib eye, so I appreciated that.  It's literally the size of a large pizza, so be prepared for leftovers!  I shared it with my 10 year old, and we were full after a little over half.  I can only really compare the flavor to being very similar to the taco bell Mexican pizza, only with slightly elevated ingredients in black beans rather than refried.  I ate the leftovers for dinner that evening.  Woke up about 4am with a terrible stomach ache, and my GF was already up in the guest bathroom.  She called in sick the next day.  Not going to blame the food, because I'm not like that.  Just telling my experience.  Not bad if you're stuck waiting to get your car fixed, but can't suggest coming here if you have means of transportation.  I hate giving bad reviews.

This place deserves all of the 5 stars it's getting.  We've been a few times now, every donut we've tried is sooooo good.  The employees are all so nice and helpful.  The prices are super reasonable.  If you're anywhere near this place and you are craving donuts, go there, you won't regret it.  Well, you'll probably regret the half-dozen donuts you eat because they're so good.

My girlfriend doesn't use Yelp and she asked me to post on her behalf.  She's been wanting to try this place ever since it opened.  Each time, I told her that it looked janky and what kind of "Spa" can exist in a Laveen strip mall, sandwiched between a 99 Cents Only store and a farm feed shop. I've taken her to Spas before and they are in resorts.  But I left it up to her to decide.  She finally decided to spoil herself and get one of the packages which included a massage and a manicure.  I dropped her off and proceeded to shop at said 99 Cents Only store waiting for her phone call to come back and get her.  Moments later, I got the call and she said I was right.  I do love being right.  She didn't have any of the issues experienced by others where they had to wait even though they had an appointment.  She was led right in to the massage room.  This is where her story lines up with most others who complained.  She said the room was filthy, the table was grimy and oily.  Someone's clothing including underwear and socks were sitting on a table a few feet away. My girlfriend asked who the clothes belonged to and the massage girl mumbled something and picked them up.  There is no peaceful, relaxing feeling about the room.  The massage person was rude and was good at giving the stink eye and seemed to be annoyed that my girlfriend was there paying for services.  She was so grossed out, she didn't even get her shirt off before changing her mind and making a b-line towards the exit.  This seems like a terrible way to make a first impression on someone, and now she'll never go back there, not even to get her nails done.

Amazing gyros!  The employees are all very friendly.  I had a gyro with the French fries and then also ordered one to go for a co-worker back at the office.  They waited until I was almost done with my gyro before bringing out the to go order so that my co-worker would have a warm gyro when I got back.  The fries are kind of bland, next time I'll get the Greek salad as my side option.  I'm going to have a hard time now when I'm in this area deciding between this place and the famous cheesesteak place in the same complex.

We've lived in this area for almost 4 years now.  When this place first opened as a grocery store under a different name and different ownership, we were pretty jazzed.  We were told every time we went in and grabbed fun items like pickles or spices, that they would be serving cooked food soon.  After a few years of it never happening, and it changing hands several times, we kind of gave up on coming.  Once I saw the Kabab King sign up, I was really excited.  It took what feels like forever to finally open, and then even more time before we finally had the opportunity to go here.  We had an appointment at the nearby Sonora Quest Lab and decided it would be a perfect time to try it out.  We both ordered the Gyro with French Fries.  This does not come with a drink, you have to pay extra so we both got bottled waters.  We also ordered the sambosas.  It took a while for the food to come out.  First, the sambosas came out with a nice green sauce.  Very good, but you can tell they were store bought and cooked in a toaster oven.  We waited even longer and finally got our Gyros.  We were so very disappointed.  The meat is imitation frozen meat.  The kind of stuff I've only seen once or twice in my life, where the strips are all uniform, as if they were vacuum formed.  Anyone who's ever had anything close to an authentic Gyro would be able to spot this.  It's the same fake stuff I mention in one of my other one star reviews, a deli and grill using this junk.  My biggest issue was the Gyro poster on the wall depicting REAL Gyro meat cooked on a spit.  There was very little meat and a lot of lettuce, tomato and pickles.  The sauce was so thin, it felt a lot like store bought Greek salad dressing, not tzatsiki.  The fries were cold, bland and soggy.  We went to pay and he charged me for the food that the ONLY OTHER CUSTOMERS in the entire restaurant ordered.  We had to correct him, as it was about twice the cost.  They thanked us and reminded us of the buffet on Sundays. Don't think we'll be back or try the buffet here.  Much like trying a taco at a Mexican food place for the first time, if you can't get a Gyro right, then there's just no love in the food.  The restaurant was hot, with big fans blowing and one TV set to some weird channel about $35,000 plane tickets.  I can't even imagine how hot it will be this summer.  None of this surprised me, but I REALLY wanted to be surprised.  They all seem like really sweet employees and owners and very friendly, and it makes me sad to give only 2 stars.  It doesn't seem like they do enough business to support making all fresh stuff which is fine, so maybe they should re-envision their business and represent itself as a fast food mid-eastern place.

Just as good as the Tucson locations. We saw El Guero Canelo in person. Cool to see the owner interacting with the employees and customers. Tried the asada burrito for the first time and it was awesome. The construction out front is lame and the parking lot was small, not restaurant's fault. Bring cash, that line is shorter. I'm so happy that they opened here. Will bring as many people as I can to this place!  The prices are really amazing, we were so full on the $25 I spent on myself, my fiancée and our son.  I had tons of leftovers.  Everything is great about this place!  I don't give 5 stars normally, but I'm still dreaming about our meal last weekend and can't wait to go again this weekend!

I've had the #16 spinach and pear smoothie with a multivitamin boost twice now. It's really refreshing and tasty. It's right up the street from my house and I'll be coming here more often.  It's right next door to the Halal restaurant I reviewed not too long ago. It's been empty both times I've been here, so I hope more locals come in and support this place. Only negative I guess is that the computers here look pretty janky, but I don't come to surf the web.  There's free WiFi, so if you do want to surf, maybe bring your own laptop.  This place does seem like a good spot to hang out and work on the internet, all of the chairs are very comfortable.  Hopefully, soon, I'll be able to try their wraps and salads.  The caesar salad wrap looks very tempting.  The only reason I don't go for 5 stars is just kind of the low budget feel of everything, old computers and kind of shoddy construction on the tables, etc.

Best tandoori chicken I've ever had!  This place is really good.  I liked every dish I tried and you could tell it was all homemade.  I got there right when they opened for the lunch buffet.  I got first dibs on all the new stuff they were bringing out and it was hot and fresh.  I always have a hard time remembering the names of most dishes, but they were all very good.  The chicken tikka masala was also amazing.  The spice level was perfect, just enough to make my nose run a bit.  I can tell this place has a strong grasp on spice use and levels and are masterful at bringing it right to the edge for buffet food that everyone can eat it and everyone will be pleased.  They fill your water as soon as you walk in and give you the option of plain or garlic naan.  I opted for garlic.  It's not as crispy as I'm used to, but it's still really good, and I think most people prefer the way it's prepared here vs. the crackery crispy type that I've had elsewhere.  This is strictly personal preference.  I spoke with the owner during my meal and he was very friendly and gave me a history of the restaurant, how long they've been open and their philosophy that "everything we serve here is what we eat at home".  It shows in their food for sure.  It's cool to have the actual owner tell you that his father is cooking for you the same thing he cooks at home for his own family.  The lunch buffet price is very reasonable.  Definitely go for the buffet to get a wide variety of everything.  They have a large selection, a nice salad section as well as several sauces which is very rare for an Indian buffet.  It's nice to have those sauces available.  My only one gripe.  My lady was unable to go with me on that day, so I promised to bring her home a dish.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala to go.  The owner asked me if I just want some from the buffet or they can make it scratch.  I opted to go with from scratch and asked for mild, since my girl doesn't need her food to be hot for her to enjoy it.  When he brought it out, it was a medium sized cup container of the entree, but there was no side of rice or naan bread.  Just the dish.  I don't know if he just kind of misunderstood what I was asking for, but I was charged more for the little cup of food than i was for the three plates (yes i had three don't make fun) of food I had at the buffet.  Maybe the owner can comment and I will switch to 5 stars if maybe I was confusing the way I ordered to go.  If not, I think this place would be perfect if they were to include a cup of rice and maybe a naan bread to make it worth the price.  The restaurant is clean and they opt to play Indian music with a contemporary twist, so you get a little something for everyone.  They keep the buffet very clean, they are attentive and fill your water constantly, which is good because this food can be spicy.
