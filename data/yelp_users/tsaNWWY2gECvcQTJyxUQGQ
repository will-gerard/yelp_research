I have been to this shop a total of two times  The first time was three years ago when I wanted to swap out the riser handlebars on my bike to bullhorn. I was turned away because they "do not stock" any stems that fit the bullhorn handle bars I purchased.   No biggie....   The second time I went I had a complete bike in pieces and need help from Landis to build it.   The guy that attended me, forgot his name, told me that I was missing the bottom riser for my headset that was sent to me from the manufacturer that I purchased. Mind you it was a track bike or fixie. However I was mislead by that bike "expert," all the pieces needed were there. I went to Landis to get help but they were not knowledgable enough to recognize this set up.   Also, as I walked in the shop all the other employees looked at me and my bike with disgust. That is the second time I walk in and am judged by the preference of my bicycle. I just didn't feel welcomed.   Anyway, I don't recommend any service from this store if you have a fixed gear bike. They seem to hate that there.
