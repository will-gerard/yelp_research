It's so hard to find good vegetarian and vegan restaurants and I wish I would have discovered this place sooner.  Great atmosphere and friendly staff.  The environment, decor, tastes, and smells make me feel like I am back in the islands.  I am officially making this my new favorite place to eat in north Scottsdale.

I used to frequent 5th and Wine because of the great atmosphere and service but was sadly disappointed last night.  I felt as though our server was rushing us through our meal by not allowing us time to finish our courses before crowding our table with the next round of plates.  When the entrees arrived there seemed to be some confusion on behalf of our server because the wrong order was placed.  After sitting watching my dinner mate complete his entire meal my plate finally arrived with many apologies through the remainder of the meal.  Being already irritated from the inconvenience, I was even more disenchanted with my experience when I discovered that my pork tenderloin was over cooked, crispy and dry.  Needles to say I was no longer in the mood to endure my dinner when the check came with more apologies from our server.  On the check it visibly showed the errors that were made and the adjustments put in but what I did not see was a good faith adjustment of any sort to make up for the overall frustrating experience.  When I mentioned this to the server he seemed completely oblivious.  Sorry 5th and Wine but I may need to take another hiatus from frequenting your establishment.  And just so you know, being offered a comp desert for the inconvenience, when we are obviously very ready to leave is sort of an insult.

I liked the atmosphere but was overall underwhelmed with the food.

I have driven by this place so many times and never really knew what they were all about.  Last weekend I got to sample some of there foods at the Cook Phoenix event downtown and I knew I was going to have to make a point of going there the next night.  The atmosphere was very sleek and contemporary but not pretentious, the service was excellent, and the food was amazing.  Their list of sakes and martinis made it difficult to decide on what to start with but if you are a sweet tooth, they have a martini made with strawberry puree and muddled basil and mint.  It was fantastic!!!  All of the tapas that we ordered were delicious but the sizzling shrimp was to die for.  Definitely going back again.

Was taken to this little hidden treasure by a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised.  Their menu options were all very tempting but I have to rave about the brisket sandwich that I ordered.  All of the ingredients were very fresh and flavorful.  If you are looking for some great food in a laid back atmosphere, I definitely recommend stopping in here.
