Excellent food and good service!  Went for lunch with a coworker, who had never been here before. Both of us enjoyed the salsa and very unique tortilla chips. Wish I had ordered the made-at-the-table guacamole. Prices were very reasonable (especially for downtown Phoenix).  Both of us ate more than we should have. The servings were huge and dee-licious! Way too full to even think of ordering dessert. More reason to return!

Epic Failure!  Went for lunch with a coworker. Sat for nearly 10 minutes without a waiter/waitress coming to our table. We watched people who arrived after us get their drink orders taken and delivered during that same time period.   The only time when we thought our waiter discovered us is when we got up to leave for a different restaurant. Someone was chasing after us as we walked to the elevator.  The hostess was equally clueless. She apparently didn't recognize us as the people she brought to a table only moments ago and asked if we enjoyed our lunch.  The place was only a third full at most. No reason for the extremely poor service.  Can't wait until Sliders opens for the season!  This TGI Fridays is an epic failure!

I had dinner there only one time and it was really good. The person working was very friendly. They didn't rush me and a friend who sat there for a couple hours socialize over dinner. Price is good - competitive. I agree with Bill Z - egg drop soup was only okay. The Kung Pao Chicken was VERY good. My friend had Sweet & Sour Chicken and said it was good. She chose House of Yang for our dining location, so she obviously likes it. They do have a web site with an online menu. Next time I'm in the area and want Chinese food, this is where I'd go (I think it's better than that PF place).

If someone at this restaurant is willing to do this to a Sheriff Deputy, do you REALLY think an average customer would fair any better?! - - - - - - - - - - - - - Maricopa County Sheriff deputies felt threatened and concerned that a Pei Wei employee might tamper with their food when they were ordering during a recent food break.   A manager remarked that the deputies were responsible for arresting too many of the kitchen staff at the restaurant.  It was suggested the manager who made the comment may have been referencing MCSO's recent crackdown on illegal immigration.  According to the Sheriff, the Pei Wei employee proceeded to offer to cook "something special" for the deputies.  The deputies, according to the Sheriff, felt threatened by the remark and returned their food, worried about food contamination.

Eh. Deep fry anything and there's flavor. A little surprised they can't follow simple instructions.

Three different occassions I have gone to purchase items at this location and all three times they were out of stock. The third time I even called in advance and was told the merchandise I was looking for was in stock. The clerk, when I asked, wouldn't even go in the back to see if there was additional supply that hadn't been put on the shelves. These were not "on sale" items - I was looking for every day computer and/or video cables and components. Save yourself a trip: Make the trip to the Best Buy in Surprise or to the one on I-17 & Thunderbird.

Food is okay. Most of the menu seems high priced. Service is inconsistent. One day it's great and another day it's bad. If the service was exceptional all the time the high menu prices wouldn't be as noticeable. Happy hour is okay with discounts on drafts, drinks and appetizers (bar only). They have about a dozen televisions in the bar plus trivia, and karaoke.

For fast food, this was pretty good. It was actually fresh and tasty food.  Bonus for techies and those of us who have nomadic offices: they have a plug-in station and free Wi-Fi.  Everyone working there must've been tired (or bored). No one smiled.

I've been here several times and realized I never wrote a review. Always a great experience!  Staff is always friendly, upbeat, and helpful with suggestions (and not always suggesting the most expensive items either). Had to stop the last server from refilling my water glass. It was never less than half full.  Big portions, very delicious, and great desserts...or is that an obvious comment? They lose a star 'cause it's a bit on the pricy side even with big servings.  If they had Wi-Fi available in the bar area, I could work while enjoying an adult beverage and more.

It's actually called "Skinny Dugan's Casino." Not sure where the "pub" part comes in the name. I might have missed it.  A nice neighborhood bar with lots of regulars and "normal" people (a.k.a. not people from out of town). Everyone was friendly and lots of televisions for sports. Yes, they do have slot machines. It's still Vegas.  They have a cigar smoking clientele and, from what I was told by several people, this is THE place to go if you're a cigar smoker.  I stuck with liquid dinner instead of ordering real food. Must be good 'cause there were several dozen people in the dining room having dinner.

Food is really good. Service is terrific. The bartenders are fantastic. Try the shrimp fajitas. They offer other Mexican dishes in addition to fajitas. If you like frozen margaritas order them with Cuervo Gold...don't use the pre-mix frozen unless you get a shot of tequilla added to it. Also, they cook everything right there in the open. Be prepared to smell like a delicious fiesta after you leave.

Run of the mill neighborhood bar. Not sure about the food since I've only had the wings, which are okay. They lose a lot of points because of bad service.   I understand management wants to watch labor costs and bartenders/servers want to have as many customers for the tips. This place is always understaffed. Two different times I was here to watch a game with a cold drink and dinner. Both times the bartender was too busy to take my dinner order. This last time I was waving the menu to get her attention and that didn't work. Paid for my beer and left. Went to another nearby bar that had good food and great service.  I was looking for a new neighborhood bar. Ya know...one you would go to several times a week for happy hours and late night fun. Won't be this place.

Visited this place twice and both times received really poor service, once at the bar and once a table. Pizza was okay; better than Domino's but nothing special. I like playing Buzztime Trivia and QB1. The third time I went there the Arizona Cardinals were featured as the QB1 game. I go to a sports bar to watch the other NFL games because the Cardinals are on regular television. If I wanted to watch the Cardinals I would do so at home. I didn't stay that day and haven't been back since. The place might have gotten better, might still be the same. I'm not willing to take the chance.

Nice place. Very friendly people working there!! I didn't get a feel for the "typical" environment as they were hosting an event. Great place to meet-up with friends, study, work, or play chess or some other game.   I only glanced around the bookstore (for fear I would buy more books, which I do NOT need at the moment). Very well organized, bright, and clean.   It's not located along routes I normally travel, but I'd venture here again.

The convenience store and everyone who works there - FABULOUS! The staff is ALWAYS friendly and the store is ALWAYS clean. I will use them for gas, coffee and snacks over their competitors even when their gas price is a few pennies higher; it's worth it for the service and cleanliness. Bravo!!  The car wash is a COMPLETELY different story.  They did a mediocre job. There was so much they missed it was easier to get home and clean it myself rather than waste time pointing out all the errors.  The biggest flaw: I signed a work order; also known as a contract for services. This was negotiated with one of their supervisors. When I went inside to pay, suddenly the cashier is stamping "No Refunds" on my coy and making other alterations to the contract.   I pointed out she's altering the terms of the agreement her response, "The corporate office requires this." To her and the manager I requested to address this situation did not seem to understand they made changes to an agreement. When I asked for my copy back, they said they couldn't give it to me "...because the corporate office needs it." They did make me a photo copy.  Hindsight, I should have simply walked away. Decided I was being too rigid in my thinking. Silly me! After their blasé handling of a legal document, I should have realized the wash and was service would've been just as haphazard. I can only imagine the nightmares of using their oil change and mechanical services!!  Yes, I will continue using the gas station and convenience store. Some other business will be taking care of my vehicles.

Amazing! The food and the service were out of this world excellent.   Michael and Javier were servers for our table and both did a terrific job. Michael was very friendly, entertaining, professional, and enthusiastic.   The French Onion soup is very good and the steak I had was terrific. The tiramisu was fabulous! One person in my group had the Bananas Foster custard and he raved over that as well.  Consider making reservations if you have a large party or going to dinner during peak hours. Did I mention the tiramisu?  Expect a large bill. There were four of us dining each had a glass of wine or cocktail, split an appetizer, and all had steak dinners. The final tally was over $400 plus gratuity.   I would DEFINITELY go here again..!

The front desk and other staff were outstanding - very friendly and  professional. My room, on the other hand, was surprising considering Hitlon's above-average reputation.  The room was very bland, the tub/shower had several stains (eeww), lighting was poor, the room was serviced every day but the sheets were never changed. Yes, it was easy to determine this. I'm still hope the towels were clean (eeww!) The cable television was all snowy. Granted I didn't spend much time in the room. The below-average care was obvious. Even one of the elevator buttons was broken (wires hanging visible) all week.  Considering the nightly room rate, there are other places I would stay next time.  The buffet was great! Prime rib, steak, seafood at every meal along with complimentary draft beer and champagne. I never went to breakfast, but friends told me it was really good.

There were three of us for dinner (after getting snubbed at Phil's Italian Steakhouse inside Treasure Island).  The restaurant side was bright and fun. As we were three big guys, we ate at the cafe` bar. We didn't want to try squeezing into a booth. The server was friendly, fun, and knowledgeable about all the food. She even brought out one of the cooks to answer a question from the 'caveman diva' of our group (no, that was not me).   My NY strip steak was really good. The shrimp scampi was okay (which is the reason they didn't get five stars). The meatball soup was great! Probably because it tasted very similar to the version I make at home. The other two people in my group also thought the food was good...including the caveman. The menu selection is huge! As much as I wanted dessert, I declined as I was stuffed.  We ate on the restaurant side and I plan to go back to visit the lounge side.   I would definitely come back here again!

Spent four nights here. NOT a place to do business. No wi-fi in the rooms; just the old fashion ethernet plug. The Stage Door Deli, way back by Elevator #2 has free wi-fi connection. Someplace else in the building there's wi-fi at a fee, but I didn't look for it. New York-New York, MGM Grand, Planet Hollywood, and a couple other hotels had free wi-fi available in the public areas.  The room was okay. Decor was dated and not in an Egyptian way. The cigarette burn hole in the bedspread set the mood.  LOVE the shower...and I'm a man who enjoys a good shower. Hot water, the much needed spout high on the wall (I'm 6 foot, 4 inches), and a comfy bed. Setting the room temperature takes some doing as it's an old fashion two-knob heating/cooling unit.   If you stay in the pyramid, remember the elevators follow the building's structure. Several guests commented it felt weird (sea sick?) riding the elevator.  Almost forgot..! There's a mezzanine level off the lobby near registration with a food court. It's fast food, but probably the least expensive meal you'll have while at the Luxor.  Glad I stayed here for the experience. Won't do it again.

First thing you notice during happy hour is the lack of parking. HORRIBLE!! Took me nearly 30 minutes to find a spot and I showed up there at 4:15pm. There's a small strip mall on the corner with LOTS of signs about getting towed - car owner beware!  Inside: Dark, dismal and nothing "happy" about their prices. I was at the bar with two friends and service was lacking. It wasn't very busy either; not compared to other bars in the same area during the same time.  I didn't try any of the food, which is the only reason this place is getting two stars instead of one.   As far as I'm concerned, there are much nicer, friendlier and better priced places in the Camelback Corridor than this place.

There were three of us for dinner. We were greated promptly and with enthusiasm by the hostess, who escorted us to a nice table in the middle of the room.   ...that's about the best I can say about this place.  The restaurant was less than half full. After sitting for 15 minutes trying to figure out who was our waiter, we got up and left.  There are hundreds of other places to eat in Las Vegas. You'd think the "upscale" restaurant at Treasure Island would make an effort to actually be upscale.

Food is pretty good for bar-type selections. Prices are competitive with most "franchise" restaurants/bars. They have karaoke, BuzzTime trivia, pool tables and some video games. Place offers live music on Friday and Saturday nights. Most days/nights plan to sit at the bar. Table service is very much lacking beyond that distance. This also happened during the 2006 NFL season. I don't know what it's like this year; haven't been back for football since. Overall it's a nice neighborhood bar.

Their pizza is VERY good! Love their Sicilian style pizza. I haven't tried any of their other menu offerings, but will do so next time I'm there.  I bent the rules a bit. When you leave the pizza shop, turn left and sit on a little cafe` table around the corner in front of Gallagher's restaurant. They offer a full bar and a wider selection of beer. The cafe` tables are a great place to people watch, too.

Came out and on time. Guess I should say, arrived at the early part of the four-hour window they scheduled. Seemed to have repaired my AC unit.  Two days later, heard a loud bang. AC unit not working again. Had to take a half day off to get them rescheduled.   This one arrived after the four-hour service window, which I could understand given the work load they probably had. They didn't have the right tools and equipment to even start looking at the unit and wanted to rescheduled. Waited another 45 minutes for them to actually start working.   This repairman told me the motor and other parts hadn't been properly secured. The vibration for the system running loosened everything (that would explain the bang). No chance of getting my service fee refunded or discounted because of the first person's oversight.  So..."Methinks not."

Ya know that expression "Only get one chance to make a first impression."  I always wanted to visit this place and finally made time. While it is only 10 miles from home, it's in the opposite direction I need to go for routine stops (bank, post office, etc).  The workers seemed friendly, service was fairly quick considering it wasn't busy, and the place was clean.   The biggest problem was the cold room temperature. I will be the. first to admit I'm a delicate flower when it comes to cold weather. They had all the doors open when the outdoor temperature was 48 degrees at this time (thank you Bing Weather) I wasn't the only customer who mentioned the chilly indoor conditions. I had to point out to the staff  seven of their 8 customers were wearing jackets, hoodies, or a coat while inside. I asked if I could close the doors and only one  was allowed to be closed.  It was warmer riding my Suzuki than sitting inside this place.   Didn't even finish my coffee. Used their wi-fi system to find another place to go and left.  Wonder if they will turn on the air conditioning when it's 110 degrees in the summer.

Place is clean. Staff is friendly. There was only one other person getting a haircut when I arrived, so I was in a chair right away.  Gave $5 tip on a $15 cut and was given a strange look in return...like I hadn't tipped enough.

Decided to try this place for breakfast. I decided on a simple eggs and sausage breakfast. Nothing super special about it. I should've had a cheeseburger for breakfast.  They left the much-needed coffee pot on the table....Yay!  The server, Mary, was very friendly.  The price for the meal at The Coffee Shop was about the same as the buffet at Treasure Island, so it was the buffet the rest of the week for breakfast.  I probably wouldn't come back here in the future. There are too many other places to eat inside Treasure Island (and the rest of The Strip).

I've been to this location twice and both times were during the day for lunch. The food is pretty good considering it's a chain buffet restaurant. Good choice of selections although there were some things I didn't try (i'm not a veggie eater and the fried ocra scared me). The desserts were good too.   The first time I thought some of the activities from the server was just a quirk. The second time I realized it was standard procedure for the restaurant. Specifically, it's the amount of attention you receive compared to how long you sit there. They give you one plate when you walk in and the server brings two more plates. By your second serving the server isn't as attentive to your drink refills. On the third plate, the server won't remove empty plates and has to be flagged down for drink refills.  Now, I will admit I'm a big eater. There are times when I'll bring a book with me to read and simply sit there 'cause it's better than sitting at home sometimes. While I may not be going for more food, I will sip a beverage while I sit there. It takes effort to get that accomplished. Good luck trying to get a fourth plate. I tried that once and saw several other big guys trying to do that too. Server was slow with the new plate.  I have only been there at the beginning of dinner and they do a LOT of grilled steaks, chicken, burgers, etc. Might be worth a dinner visit simply for BBQ-style meats.   If you're looking for a wide selection of okay food with okay service, you would probably like this place. Lunch is around $11. I assume dinner is priced higher.

The hotel is practically hidden from the normal tourist locations around Scottsdale, which was fine with me. Even though it's next to the Scottsdale Airport - small private jets and planes - there was hardly any aircraft noise. I was surprised when I finally heard a private jet take off.  I got a great one-bedroom suite at a really great (rack) rate. Okay, it was June, so there isn't much demand for hotel rooms in the blazing Arizona summer. It was great for doing business and relaxing. The suite included mini-fridge, microwave, coffee maker, plates, and utensils. While I didn't have any meals in my room, it was a nice feature and the fridge came in handy.  The free breakfast was okay. A full buffet with freshly prepared eggs, sausage, potatoes, yogurt, fruit, and all the usual breakfast items. In the future, I'll skip the breakfast and go to one of the local eateries.   I did not get to the hotel's bar. Yes, this is a surprise. They do happy hour for the guests every day. My schedule was busy, so I wasn't around to participate. Unfortunately, the bar closes at 9pm. I would've had a few "night caps" had it been open later.  I would definitely come back here!

Would you like to be full after eating? Come here.  Would you like a nice dining experience and good food? Meh. I've experienced better elsewhere.  Went here first time this past weekend. Met friends to catch-up and have a nice breakfast as a start to a relaxing weekend.   Our server was very warm, friendly and engaging...with customers she knew. Our first time here her table skills were like talking to Joe Friday - just the facts. Questions were answered with an impatient attitude. Yes, I know she was busy, but we still had questions. She did tell us the morning specials and no other suggestions was offered. Not even upselling or suggestive selling side items (play 'Price is Right' loser music for the empty cash register).  Our coffee cups were never empty thanks to an army of people working the floor. That's a good thing! Coffee was on the weak side, if you like it that way.   Barely half way through our meal, maybe 40 minutes from the time we sat down, plates still loaded, EVERYONE working the floor offered us to-go boxes and to-go cups of coffee. "Everyone" means at least six different servers with our server asking multiple times. So much for a relaxing breakfast.   There was a lot of food and the taste was comparable to any national chain restaurant.   Glad I tried it. Not sure if it's worth a second visit.

Met up with a friend for dinner. My first time at this restaurant. Ordered the Chicken Pesto Lasagna. They served a very large portion, which half could be brought home for another meal (yes, I ate the entire thing. I'm a growing boy).  Service was great. Michelle (I think that was her name) was attentive and patient as we asked lots of questions.  Tried only one chianti and will need to try another one. I like a sharp, dry chianti.   Told they make the cheesecake. While I had enough room to share an appetizer, have a few slices of Italian bread, and my brick-sized serving of lasagna, I skipped dessert. (Yes, I could've had dessert, but my friend had to leave).  I want to try their pizza and feeling like there's a hole in my heart from missing dessert.

This was the first time I had ever been in a Walmart Neighborhood Market. This was a very clean and bright store! There were a few dozen people shopping; I was there around noon on a Wednesday. Some items had a terrific, low price and some were equal to other grocery stores. Nice selection of brands on the items where I was looking. Produce looked good and fresh. Parking lot was a bit confusing with construction and all the shopping carts running astray. I'll probably go here again.

Me and a friend stopped at this location for a Friday lunch after going to the movies.   The staff was friendly and not intrusive. The waitress did a good job of replenishing my soda.  As for the food: I couldn't even tell I was eating a sausage calzone. Very light on the toppings. My friend's calzone had to be returned to the kitchen for reheating; the middle was cold. Unfortunately there really wasn't anything that made the food stand out.   Desserts were okay too. We both had cheesecake and it was no different than cheesecake from a supplier that any restaurant would serve.   Comparing the price with the food quality and uniqueness, I'm not sure if I would return here.

I'm  typing  this  to  demonstrate  the  service  speed:  very  slow.  Seriously, 45 minutes for dinner to arrive and after dinner coffee (it was chai tea) took twenty minutes. There were only six of us. Went there to meet friends for dinner. Food was okay. I won't be back.

Epic failure!  Walked in to get a second line on my T-Mobile account. This store was the closest to me at the time I went shopping. Two T-Mobile people working with other customers. I started looking around at the smartphones while waiting.  Picture this: I'm 6-ft, 4-in, 300+ pounds wearing a white dress shirt, neck tie in 95-degree weather. My ninja invisibility skills come up lacking when I'm dressed like this.  So...I'm looking at the phones along one of the side displays and hear the ding of the front door as someone walked in promptly followed by "May I help you?" I turn around ready to ask my question...and the T-Mobile clerk was talking to the woman who just walked in.  I had been waiting about 15 minutes when this happened.  Will I get a T-Mobile phone?  Yup. I've been their customer since the 1990s when they were still VoiceStream.   Will I be back to this location? No way...Never...Nope  Never screw with my time or my money.

Most expensive frozen pizza ever ordered.  The order taker was friendly, the driver was friendly. Took a little longer than expected to get the delivery.   Didn't look or taste like a hand-tossed, freshly made dough. Ingredients looked like processed food and the entire thing tasted like a pizza you could get from the grocery store frozen food section.  The other Yelpers gave a good review, which is the reason I tried this place. Not sure what they got compared to what was delivered to me.

It's set back from the road, so watch for the wooden marquee sign.  The place is cozy inside and equally relaxing outside. Cushy chairs, secluded nooks, and service counter to be right up front with the action. Free Wi-Fi is bonus and the signal reaches to the patio.    Here's the best part: they serve coffee AND wine!  Nice place for a quiet moment or to share laughs with friends.

I came here on an off-night, so it was a little quiet. Everyone was friendly - staff and other guests. I drank tap beer and appetizers, which really isn't a challenge. They do hospitality night every night (I think), have an off-track betting lounge, lots of TVs for sports, Buzztime trivia (the reason I was there), and a patio.   It's a nice, neighborhood bar. Probably a good spot for happy hour.

Stopped at the bar for dinner and some drinks. SLOW, SLOW, SLOW service. A couple at the bar, maybe six tables with people in the restaurant. The bartender kept disappearing.   Took almost 30 minutes for the appetizer I ordered - cheesesteak spring rolls - to appear. $11 for two spring rolls. By the time the bartender returned and asked how they were, I was almost done.  Won't come here again.

Great place! The food and drinks are what you expect from Native New Yorker. The biggest and best difference: THE STAFF!   Everyone there is friendly, thoughtful, and efficient. Special shout-out to Hillary, the server, who does an excellent job, and Chris the bartender. He makes the world's best key lime pie martini.  Someone at another table order some apple crisp/ice cream dessert. Looked very delicious. Since I was already enjoying my fifth chocolate martini, I passed on the dessert...this time.  Lots of big screen TVs for the sports fans and Buzztime Trivia, which is very important to me.   ...maybe it was six martinis...hmmmm

Was here for a lunch meeting. Okay place. Server was attentive and efficient.  Food tasted okay, but all of us agreed it was overpriced for what was delivered. One person commented his "Ranch Hand Steak Salad" had very little steak and what was in the salad looked like the frozen Philly cheese steak meat you can buy at the grocery store.

Despite the number of Yelpers stating this place has slow/bad service, I decided to try it for myself. Silly me!  The bartender spent more time looking at liquor bottles and restocking than the seven people sitting at the bar. She did spend time talking to wait staff and some of her friends over at the service area. Couldn't even get her attention to place a food order.   On the bright side, there was plenty of open parking space and the Coca-Cola was cold.

My third time there and third time I fell for their trick.  ME: "How long is the wait?" THEM: "About 20 minutes"  End up waiting nearly an hour each time. Unfortunately, each time I've been there my hair needed to be cut and couldn't get to another shop in time.  The hair cut was good. I can get that other places that are more courteous of my time.

A surprising discovery at the Sky Harbor Airport! Took a friend to the airport, walked with her to the gate and realized there was still time before she had to go through security. That's when the aroma of coffee both hit us. Looked around and found Lola Coffee.  Doesn't have that burnt, over-roasted coffee flavor like some self-proclaimed coffee Star offers. Anyone with a sweet tooth will DEFINITELY like this!  I had the Café Blanco and it was delicious!  Places with outlets to plug in a laptop for work and comfy chairs for relaxing. Service was great too. I will admit: there weren't many people around when we stopped. Might get crazy during traditional air travel hours.  Not a five-star 'cause we didn't order a meal or pastry (yeah, difficult to imagine that, but we were both full from lunch. I had a salad, which was shocking for both of us).  This will be my coffee fix anytime I'm at the airport.

Stopped for a bite to eat and a beer. Sat at the bar where half the chairs and tables were empty.  Two bartenders on duty who spent more time talking to the other staff at the service well than paying attention to customers.  When they did take a moment to check on customers, they paid more attention to couples sitting at the bar than me or the other four people also sitting solo. Chasing the bigger guest check and tip?  As mentioned, planned to have dinner. Neither bartender came within shouting range for me to get their attention. Held the menu up and still no reaction. Actually, at that point, one of the bartenders disappeared.   Sat with a glass that was almost out of beer and STILL couldn't get attention. All of this took place in a 30-minute period. I had enough and cashed out. LITERALLY had to shout twice to get their attention.   In case you're wondering, dinner across the street at Native Grill was delicious with speedy and friendly service. The bat area at Native was packed. Not a single empty chair, table, or booth. This BWW wishes they were that busy.  Second time here and second time it was disappointing.

I couldn't understand the reason so many Yelpers talked about slow service at Zipp's. I finally understand.  I usually sit at the bar. Over the past couple weeks, I've been with others sitting at a table in the restaurant area. Three of the 4 times we waited at least  ten minutes for someone - anyone - on staff to just visit our table. Unbelievably slow with first greeting, first drinks, taking orders, getting orders delivered (twice there were problems with the wrong order), and slow everything else.

A neighborhood bar. They have good burgers, wings, and a few of the sandwiches.  Lots of televisions. Billiards (pool table) and electronic dart machine. Service is hit or miss and not person to person, but the same person depending on her mood. Some activities by workers and what they allow customers to do makes me wonder how long before the bar closes down.

This place is closed. Rode by it on April 23, 2016 and two real estate signs are in the windows.  Feel bad this happened. The problems with the operations were obvious and I wish the owner had responded to my offer to help. I even offered to help with out charging a fee because the neighborhood needs a nice, friendly, local place for food, drinks, and fun.
