If you want to not be cared for and die this is the hospital for you. They let my dementia father go after I called them - left a message with a social worker and spoke to the nurse they let him out two days later with no place to go just in a cab and sent him off. Thank god I found him! Also never followed up after I called and spoke to them about how they failed him. Horrible establishment poor excuse for a hospital.

My dress came in incorrect - the people ended up working with me even though it was against their policy. Glad that it is family run and they make decisions as a family. So a disastrous experience turned in to a great one. Also the people in the back that help are very friendly. The front could be more helpful, but once you work with someone in the back you will be happy they work with you.

Helpful people and not just trying to up-sale you. I was very fortunate that a computer I got wasn't working properly and instead of just holding me to the aggressive return policy the man returned everything. So very appreciative and he was very helpful!

Not only were the spicy chicken tacos tasty, but the staff were a breath of fresh air. They gave us tasters of something not on their menu right now, they kept making sure I enjoyed the tacos. I will absolutely return and heavily recommend that you try the food! They will have you test the meat and almost anything you want to ensure you get what you want!
