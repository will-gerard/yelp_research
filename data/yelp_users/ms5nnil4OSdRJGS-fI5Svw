Awesome food every time.  I've tried several places for pho around Phoenix, Scottsdale and Paradise Valley and this is by far my favorite.  You can taste the difference in the quality of ingredients.  Yum.

Great service, quality and experience every time.  Comfy seating, good visibility, excellent sound, clean restrooms, this is how movies should be done.   I have so many great memories with friends here.   It is always a great escape and experience.

Yum, yum, yum and yum.   Whatever's in these chicken and waffles... It's addictive.    You'll be smiling as you're stacking on pounds and hardening arteries here.  This is one of my favorite cheat day places to eat.  Tre-tre all the way!

Good food and service every time I've been here.  I really enjoy the Cesar salad and the steaks.  The entrance to the parking lot is goofy but don't let that stop you.    Give it a shot!

Busy at lunch so went outside to the patio to get seated sooner.  Had the nachos and fry bread with awesome sauce and guacamole.  The best part was the salmon.  It had an orange and BBQ tasty glaze.  Yum. Good service, good eats.

Awesome healthy options for those wanting gluten free and organic dishes.  Try the pizza and salads, you can't go wrong.   The staff are always kind and helpful.   They really shine on service.

Not at all recommended. I'm pretty easy going when it comes to Chinese food but this is really sub-par.  Greasy, salty food with low grade ingredients.  Gut buster that leaves you disappointed.

One of the few placed that exceeds expectations time and again.  Just try the salad and you'll probably be impressed like me.  I usually get a sandwich and salad combo but the pizzas are good too.  Great value and good food.

I love ice cream but I'm not a fan of cold stone.  Low grade goo passed off as ice cream is not for me - no matter how much candy and other stuff you shove into it.  I would reconsider if they changed to better ingredients.

Wow.  How do I say that in Italian?  Choices and delicious options abound at this Italian food wonderland.  Try the coffee, gelatos, pasta...  you get the idea.

Inkling rocks!  I've dealt with numerous screen printing and t-shirt companies over the years (30) in my line of work.  From pricing to quality you can't beat them.  Go with inkling!

Just had the paella lobster and shrimp with the chef's special. Amazing food and service.  Wonderful entertainment of live Latin  dancing & music to enhance the ambiance.

Few places get my highest rating and recommendation - True Food tops that list.  Without doubt, this is my favorite place to dine.  Perfect for business meetings, a place to take guests or just enjoy a relaxing, tasty foody adventure. The seasonal menu keeps it interesting and inspires a healthy lifestyle.  The ambiance just adds to the experience.   As far as service goes, it has always been impeccable, friendly and professional.   Try the fish dish!

I stopped by for a bite to eat after hearing this was a local favorite.  The service was a bit on the slow side, although friendly.  The salad was disappointing and the winded kicked up and started blowing dust and debris.  The food was left unfinished and I went elsewhere for lunch.  Was it just the salad and an off day?   What did I miss?

From the design and decor to the outstanding service, ipic is a treat.   The seats are comfortable, the sound excellent, and the picture quality is pristine.   It is like an oasis for a relaxing cinema experience, complete with treats and fun food options. My kind of place.

I've done yoga for several years and been lucky enough to practice lot of places including LA, Chicago, Vegas, Beijing, Seoul and more.  Yoga helped transform my body from years of pain, related to military training and wear.  Less pain, more mobility, better sleep, improved rest and quality of life.   I really respect flooid for its awesome programming.  You can do whichever kind of yoga your body needs.  Plus the professionalism and quality of the instruction is outstanding.  Quite frankly, I've paid far more for lower quality training.  The value they provide is remarkable.  They respect their students and really care about your goals and needs. From beginner to advanced, flooid yoga gets my highest recommendation.   I'm a professional trainer with my own facility and refer people to flooid because I know they are in the best hands.   I know great when I see it.  Of course you'll have to try it yourself to see if it's a good fit.  Pop in for yoga session then get a treat at Whole Foods for a healthy treat after.  What could be better?

A really fun place to go to reminisce about Chicago.  I get the Italian beef and a hot dog almost every time because the are so ridiculously tasty.    Try to go at off times because the lines can get really long at times.

Intrigued by the cool design, I stopped here last time I was in Cave Creek.   We were invited in and given coffee.  The guy inside was very friendly and helpful.  When I asked to pay he said it was free.  But wait, it gets better, he then offers a bag of coffee to go at no charge.  Wow!  That's how you earn a customer and build loyalty.  Good biz.  Karma all the way.

I really like Einstein but this location needs some help.  The staff seems exhausted, the lines and service are slow and the floors and tables stay dirty.  Management wake up call. Haven't been back since the last three times showed no signs of improvement.

One of the most amazing tests bud holidays I've ever enjoyed.  The recommended chef's special was a meal I won't soon forget.  It is a pricey, but worthwhile, must eat if in Vegas.  Delicious, delicious, delicious!

This is not your typical breakfast restaurant.  The open concept is bright, roomy and inviting.  The staff is cheerful and service minded.  The food is outstanding.  The portions are generous and the food worth coming back for more.

Refreshingly delicious food & service each time. I'm hooked!  I've tried many Thai restaurants in the area but found few with this level of consistent quality.  Try the Thai basil signature dish and mango sticky rice ( purple rice ).  Wow!
