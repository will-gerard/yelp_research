Holy cow!   I just had a haircut and a shave, and the experience was awesome! The cut was very good ( as always), but the shave was incredible! It took about 45 minutes, and was as "full service" as you can get (straight razor, hot towels, clay mask, cold towels, shoulder massage after).   You owe it to yourself to give it a shot, guys!

Great job on my oil change! I dropped off the car unannounced and they were able to get me in the same day. When the car was done they did not try to hard up-sell me on anything else, did not overcharge for the oil change, and I even got a $5 discount when I checked in. Great experience and I will definitely be back again

I Love this Ace location!  I have been here a few times, and every time I have been here I have been greeted by a friendly rep, always gotten help when needed, and everyone seemed very genuine and happy to be there.   They also are a larger location, so there is an excellent inventory and selection. Plus, ACE is a much more personable experience than going to Home Depot, Lowes, etc. I definitely recommend it!

The UPS store was a very good experience. The lady behind the counter was really helpful in allowing me to select packing material, repackage my parcel, and pay the postage. I had to repackage the parcel in the store, and she was very patient and helpful, even helping get more packing peanuts for me to use.   I will definitely go back again (hopefully better prepared next time)!

Love Niro's! I have been coming here for years and have enjoyed it every time I come. They have really good food, tons of space to sit and relax, and the pricing is competitive with any other Greek cuisine place I have been. Everything is made fresh as well, so you always get fresh, hot food

My favorite of the big box, discount stores in the area. This Target is very well kept, is almost always cleaned, well stocked, and kept up, and the layout is very easy to navigate.   While a little more expensive than Walmart in some areas, it is a much more enjoyable atmosphere and buying experience here, so I am ok if I pay a little more.

This is the closest Subway to home, and is conveniently located in an easily accessible strip mall. The store is always very clean and organized, and the people working are friendly and helpful.

I really enjoy this Water and Ice location. The people are always very personable here, are eager to help, and always seem to be in a good mood.   There is also a good selection of things here. You can get your normal water and ice stuff, but in addition they have great ice cream, shaved ice, and a ton of treats. I take my family there every once in a while just to get a scoop if I've cream and hang out. I definitely recommend them.

This was the best Carl's Jr I have been to in a while. The wait was a little long, but I'm ok with that if I get fresh food ( and it was).   The chicken sandwich was cooked well but not dry at all, and the sauce was really good. It's not quite Chick-fil-a, but still a solid sandwich.

This is a good location, and constantly busy! They have good service, everyone has a great attitude, and the lobby is nice and comfortable.   My only complaint with this location is the parking lot, and specifically how hard it is to get in and out, especially when it is busy. Be ready to cram through some tight spots and dodge some cars if you are there when it's busy!

Really good food!  Pei Wei is a little pricy, but the food is really good and different from almost anything else in the area. They have a lot of Chinese/Japanese fusion-style cuisine, and it is made fresh to order.   The dining room is also very spacious and comfortable, and the portions are large enough to share if you want. Overall, I definitely recommend it!

This is a solid location. First, I feel that Chevron has the best fuel around and I try to go here whenever I need to gas up.  This location is a little fated, but is clean, functional, and convenient. They offer gas, propane refills, and a car wash, and have a large selection inside, especially for the size of the store.

This is a very unique Starbucks location, and a lot of fun to be at. There is a very diverse crowd there, the layout has more seating than most locations (inside and out), and the feel is very comfortable and interesting. The only issue I have is that the lines are huge there and the way the counter is situated it created a big, awkward bottleneck where you pick up the drinks. If you can deal with that, though, it's a fun place!

Good place to cach a movie. They have good sound systems, plenty of theatres, and some good restaurants in the area to grab food or a drink. The food is... well... theatre food, so nothing special. Definitely try to hit Pita Jungle or Ra before if you want real food. Biggest grip is that the seats are a little tight. Overall, though, this is our family's theatre of preference. By the way, if you see a lot of movies the Stubs card is worth the money.

It will save you a ton of money and you will find high quality stuff.

Easily my favorite Costco in the valley. First off, the store is always clean and straightened. The selection is awesome and the layout of the store makes it easy to see everything without getting lost or overwhelmed with the inventory. The people always seem very happy to be there and are extremely helpful. The lines are fast (by Costco/Sam's standards), and the food at the cafe is tasty and incredibly cheap.

How do you not love Costco!! The layout is enjoyable to shop in, there is a great selection, and the people there are awesome. Plus, you can eat a small meal just from the samples throughout the store. Additionally, the gas pumps there are very convenient and save me money from most other fuel stations.   Just be prepared to spend around $200... Not sure why, but I always end up spending $200 when we go!

Disappointing... I went in to kill some time and check out the shop, and will not be going back. The layout looks like an indoor yard sale, there is an "old stuff" aroma, and the sales staff looked like they hated being there. Not a great experience at all...

My son has been going to Triple R since he was 3 months old, and has loved every minute! The staff there is fantastic and I have always felt that they cared about my son. They keep classes small enough so that the kids get 1:1 attention, do a lot of reading and counting games, and have a great play area outside for the kids to run around and have fun. I would recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat!

This is a so-so McDonald's location. The pluses are the location (right off of Chandler and 44th St), the giant play area for kids, and the large dining area. The minuses are that the parking lot is a pain, the drive thru is very slow, and the lot just feels kinda dirty.   At the end of the day it's all McDonald's food, so my rating is based on the experience, people, and feel of the location. And on this trip, the people seemed like they we're sleep-walking.

I want to give a better review, but unfortunately today's experience was too poor to overlook.  Bad experience today... Low inventory, really slow service, their signature breakfast item is the muffins. While I was standing in line they ran out of almost everything and apparently weren't prepared with any new muffins baking.   I walked out instead of getting breakfast.

Not sure what the other crab-apples are complaining about, but I really enjoy Paradise Bakery, and this location in particular. This location is conveniently located, has always had very courteous staff, and has been very clean and tidy every time I have ever come here. Here are a couple of the highlights:  - Very clean and organized line for ordering - Easy to find what you want from the menu - Clean and tidy drink area - Dining room is separated somewhat from the ordering line, which keeps it quiet and relaxed. The 'vibe' here is great, and there is a nice area to eat and hang out on the patio if you want to enjoy the weather - Extremely clean and nice bathrooms - Free, functioning, fast WiFi!!

I love Hand and Stone!   I have been to a few massage places, but this is by far the best. Hand and Stone has very experienced and skilled massage therapists that do great work. They are competitively priced, and offer 1, 1.5, and 2 hr massage appointments.  The franchise owners are excellent as well. This location was not as good before they came in, but they are extremely personable, flexible and easy going, and willing to do whatever they can do to make the customer happy.   If you live in Ahwatukee give them a try. You will not be disappointed!

This is a really good place to hang out and get frozen yogurt. They have a nice variety of frozen yogurt flavors available, and a ton of toppings available to add.  My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are kind of expensive as they charge by weight, so it is easy to rack up a $5 yogurt if you're not careful.

Very good bar-b-que at Rudy's. My favorite is the breakfast tacos, which are less than $2 each and made fresh every morning.  The dinner food is very good as well, specifically the pulled pork and brisket. The only thing holding the 5th star back is the pricing. The a la carte style of ordering makes it very easy to end up with a large bill. If you don't mind that, though, it's a solid meal!

This is a good, convenient location and has great deals on sodas and coffees. They also have a good automatic car wash available and discounts on the wash if you buy gas.  The down side is that this location is a nightmare to navigate. The parking lot is always congested and is poorly set up, it is hard to find parking, and when you get in the store is crowded and hard to move around in. This location needs a serious remodel in my opinion.

The car wash was pretty good and fast, but the dryers were disappointing to say the least. I paid for a premium wash and the dryers left a wet streak down the middle of my car. So now I have a clean car with a water spot stripe down the middle... For a $13 wash, you should expect and receive a better finished wash

PostNet is a locally owned and operated mail, packaging, shipping, and printing shop that provides fantastic service every time I visit. I have been in multiple times and the store is always clean and neat, brightly lit and comfortable to be in, and I am able to get my shipping done quickly and effectively. It is absolutely better than a visit to the USPS location, UPS store, or FedEx Kinkos in the area, and you are supporting a local business. I definitely recommend them to anyone who needs shipping services!
