Great company!  The ladies on the phone helped me customize my dog door to git my needs.  The man who came to install was on time, clean, and professional.  Best of all if you have a rescue dog, Hale will donate 10% to an animal charity of your choice.  Highly recommend!

Referred to Camelback moving from a co-worker, best decision!  I had two guys come move me- both were very professional, on time, and got the job done quickly.  Fees quoted were right on and there were no hidden or additional fees. Would definitely use again!

I've used Eli the Handyman twice and both times I have been super happy. Eli and his crew remodeled a bathroom for me and it turned out amazing. They laid new tile, light fixtures, mirror, and installed a new vanity.   Reliable, on time, professional, and affordable!

Terrible, terrible, terrible!  Beware of hidden fees, slow movers, and thieves.  My credit card was stolen during my moved and used at a gas station miles away from my new house.  When I made the appointment, I was not told of additional fees for stairs or that the company only accepted cash.  The two men barely spoke English.  Stay away, I would rather move myself than use this company.
