Never have I ever experienced such shitty service but, I guess that is what you can expect when every employee is a stoner. I called ahead because I heard that they have really good soup bowls and I wanted to make sure that they had the soup I wanted before making a trip there. When I called, a guy answered the phone and said he had no idea if they had any soup and sounded completely confused by my question. He placed me on hold to check with another employee. I waited about 5 minutes and decided that I should just head that way because I had a feeling that I was going to be on hold a while the way it was already going. I literally walked in the door and was standing in line to order by the time the guy finally picked up the phone. I was on hold for 20 minutes! What kind of company keeps someone on hold for that amount of time for any reason. He then told me that they did not have any more soup and they didn't plan on making anymore tonight. I confronted them about how awful the service was and told them that I would never be going back again and instead of saying sorry or even offering a different alternative he just said " we were busy so I wasn't able to check until now." I would not advice anyone to eat here unless you don't mind being blown off as a customer and being waited on by people who honestly don't seem to care about good customer service. I for one know that I will NEVER be going back and I will let anyone who asks about this place that it is not worth your time or money.

I came here twice today to refill some propane and was told that the clerk would be right out to help me with it. I waited for 10 minutes and still hadn't been helped. I had some other errands to run so I left and decided I would head back up there when I was finished and just gave the clerk the benefit of the doubt. Well, I went back up about an hour later I was was told the same thing. By this time there were three of us waiting and again nobody came out to help us. Clearly this place doesn't want or need business if they can just let people stand around and wait to not be helped. I won't be going back.

One star is actually to many. This store has decent sales however,  it's NEVER open! There are only two employees at this facility so if one of them gets sick they just throw a sign on the door saying they are closing early or going to be closed for X amount of days. I know I'm not the only one who thinks this is very unprofessional as I've talked with other people who have been waiting at the doors 20 minutes after it's supposed to be open wondering if they are going to open at all that day. If you are planning on shopping here make sure you call ahead of time to make sure you're not just going to waste your time and gas.

This specific location is amazing. The food is always fresh and the staff here is always incredible! I have to say I'm even more impressed after what just happened this evening. I went in tonight, ordered my food and when I got up to pay I realized that I had misplaced my debit card and didn't have any cash on me. I was starting to panic one because I had no idea where my debit card was and two I was feeling awful because I didn't want them to make me feel bad for being that person. The staff didn't even bat an eye. The cashier just said to pay it forward the next time I was there and told me that my food was on him. I have nothing but good things to say about the staff at this location. Thank you guys for making an awkward situation feel like it wasn't a huge deal and showing me that there are still good people and good companies out there.
