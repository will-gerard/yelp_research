The hostess didn't acknowledge us, she just stayed on phone while we stood. Finally someone came from the back to seat us in the nearly empty restaurant. I said "Thank you." She instantly shot back curtly, "I can dish out attitude too!" Taken by surprise I retorted, "If you think that was attitude you've never seen attitude." Believe me, there wasn't any intention to give her attitude, after all she helped us as soon as she saw us, so I was happy with her. In any case, it was an unprofessional way to deal with the situation.  It took about 10 minutes for our actual waiter to come to ask us what we wanted to drink. Still he answered our questions well, even if they didn't turn out to be 100% factual, he helped stear our decisions. There were spicy honey wings that we were interested in, but I can't stand the chilli vinegar taste/smell of buffalo sauce...I asked him, "Is it light on the buffalo and heavy on the honey?" he answered yes. INCORRECT. Probably the strongest buffalo tasting/smelling chicken I've even been close to. I had to push it further to the other side of the table to keep my eyes from watering.  Oh and Faux news...err I mean Fox not-really News was playing on the TV in the bar :/  Lame. I'm not going back.

If you're into family-style seating with strangers, limited menus, not having a drink with your meal, and small portions with large price tags, it's perfect.  I hope to go back when they have their liquor licence; that'll give it at least one more star (depending on how many drinks I have ;)

Sooo, is it normal for bike shop workers to be super smug? Seriously, you'd think I was interrupting them from their efforts at curing cancer. My apologies for my patronage and desire to spend money at your shop, it shan't happen again.  Also, I was quoted over the phone that a service would be $40, when I get there they say $45, but when I pick it up: $50. They said it would be easy to do, and I could pick it up the next day, but after going out if my way, nope...not ready.  Bottom line, I don't recommend this place.

I'm afraid I'm going to have to call rank on the issue of sushi. As a person who has lived in Hokkaido, Japan for a number of years (an island regarded by many as having the best Japanese food) this place is awesome on many levels! It has GREAT sushi!  Personally, I like to order from the underground menu, just ask for it...it has some really great rolls listed. The hardest part is going to be choosing just a few...you're gonna want all of them. Most recently I enjoyed the Sasquatch Roll.

This might surprise you, but this place doesn't have servers. I was expecting a sit-down-and-order experience, but was wrong and I've talked to others who've thought the same thing (there are places to sit it's just more like a deli than a restaurant). Still, that shouldn't put you off...they make great sandwiches and on Mondays they have GREAT lunch specials!  Sometimes there is live music, which is real nice (especially if the performer is attractive and sometimes they are).  When I go I usually order the Avacado Sandwich or the Briesciutto.

Excellent customer service. I really needed my oil changed in time for my trip the next day and even though the service center was official closed they let me in.  Got my car in and out quickly, great experience!

Love Trader Joe's! A strong chain with a local grocery store feel. Their variety of stocked goods caters to many dietary needs like gluten-free, low sodium, low-fat, low carb, lactose free, etc. I love to go there for fresh fruits and veggies as well.   This place attracts a wide range people from different lifestyles, backgrounds, ethnicities, creeds, and eccentricities. Just go with it, it's part of the experience and the $2 wine and $3-buck Chuck really help. :)   YOU MUST TRY:  1. Mochi! If you've never had it the time has come!! Mochi is overlooked by everyone who's never had exposure to Asian candy and dessert. Ask one of the employees about their Mochi Ice Cream! You'll be glad you did!  2. Gluten-Free Granola. If you have a sensitivity to gluten, but have a hard time finding snack items that taste good, look no further. Even though I'm not celiac or gluten sensitive I find this treat hard to resist.  3. Fat-Free Greek Yogurt. Obviously this won't be an option for my lactose-free and vegan friends, but with a little bit of Stevia you can have quite a healthy, weight-concious, and satisfying meal (It takes me half a container to fill me up [blush], you may need less).  4. Dried Mango slices with Chili. For people not familiar with Central and South American treats, this is gonna sound weird...maybe even blasphemous, but you must sample at least once; I'm sure glad I did! (There are other dried fruits with chili on them too which I also recommend :)  5. CHEESE! I love cheese, and there is a surprisingly diverse selection of good ones here. I almost have to avoid the area of the store completely or I'll come home with tons of it.

Putting a high price tag on a plate does not make it good.   Service: excellent  Ambiance: good   The food was disappointing and overpriced, the ravioli, undercooked, the blue cheese overpowered the rest of the salad.   No shortage of expensive vehicles carefully positioned by the valet, but I'm afraid that money can't buy you good taste.

What do you get when you mix the smell of mold with the smell of 6-month-old sweat? This 24 Hour Fitness location  I started to feel ill after only 10 minutes of breathing in that horrible smell!  Everything from the stationary bikes to the sanitizer dispensers are in disrepair.  I hope to be updating my review soon with more stars, but things are only getting worse at this juncture.

Service was unfriendly  5. Felt ill afterward   Don't waste your time here, there are lots of awesome places to eat in Phoenix.

OMG! I love Copenhagen! The fun and unique contemporary designs have lasting appeal. Want to have art on your floors and supporting your bed, as well as on your walls? Well this is the place.   Now, keep in mind: your going to pay an artistic premium for each piece. I tend to have expensive taste (it's a curse) The bed frame I want: $3K. The sheets I bought for my bed: $200; blanket: $800; specialty pillow: $250; couch: $4K; coffee table: $400; bar stools: $350 each (OUCH!). You know what though? It looks amazing! That bedroom and living area will really POP, in all the right ways!   Don't we all wish we could afford the things we wanted? Sigh. Maybe I'll have most of that stuff before I retire :/

This place really appeals to a specific market. I mean, I was the only one in there without a cowboy hat and boots.   I do have to admit, every piece I saw was super ugly and style-less. Let me qualify that; unless your goal is to satirize the intelligence or political views of a Texan wannabe cow-chump then this shop is not for you. It's almost like the "customers" paroozing in there just wanted to go in and, for once, feel superior about what they chose to wear.   Oh, and it's SUPER expensive. A hideous pair of boots will set you back about $400.

ATTENTION ALL YELPERS! If you haven't been to this restaurant, or haven't been in a while it really deserves our support.  I went there for a date recently, and there wasn't a strong patronage the whole evening. :( They're missing out!  I too, like other recent reviewers, used the Travel Zoo voucher for a 3-course meal for two including two glasses of prosecco for $39 (valued at $95). I can honestly say it would have been well worth the full price, but with the discount made it just that much better :)  We ordered the Caprese and Individual Antipasto Platter as our appitizers, both were delicious, but I think I preferred the freshness, subtile sweet tartness of the balsamic dressing, and the presentation of the Caprese. The Chicken Saltimbocca and Filet Mignon entrees were both mouth wateringly delicious and FILLING, so much so that I almost didn't have room for the Panna Cotta  with caramel sauce and Double Chocolate Mousse ;)...Who am I kidding, I always have room for dessert! :D. I just have to say, the Panna Cotta made me tingle!  A word on the service: Excellent! Our server was friendly and accommodating, didn't see a single way in which she could have done better!

A diamond in this rough neighborhood. Be prepared to wait, most nights it's very busy. Order one of their amazing margarita's and try to relax in their very limited space. I've tried a couple of things, but by far the best item is their seasonal Chiles en Nogada. Be sure to order their Guacamole, they make it right in front of you and add the fun twist of pomegranate seeds to the mix. It's awesome!

A great place to lounge by yourself. The coffee and teas are great. I love the White Chocolate Mocha; your taste buds will love it, your hips may not.  Don't go there expecting people to be friendly, it feels more like a library. Everyone generally keeps to themselves with their eyes glued to their various screens.

"What is SHE doing here?" you can almost hear the group of women (who could easily be cast as "The Real Housewives of Scottsdale") say at the table next to you.  Ya know, the food is just ok. I really like the drinks, but what actually draws me back is the interesting interior design. They change the inside frequently and it's always really cool and surprising. One time they had a bunch of manikin legs descending from the ceilings, suspended by lengthened fishnet stockings. Awesome.  It's a little hard to find; you can't see the entrance from the most convenient parking spots.  Try it once, see you if you like it...if you're not at least able to tolerate "the scene" you won't be impressed.

Mesa suffers from a serious poverty of fun things to do and good places to eat, but before you start praying for daylight there is hope! If you're tired of soulless chain establishments and Mexican food that seems a little too authentic, but don't want to flee to Tempe or Phoenix Tia Rosa's is just what the foodie ordered.  Salmon Taco with Mango Salsa, need I say more? Yum - E!

There's little more to say that hasn't already been said.  Matt's has very familiar items on their menu, but each that I've tried really is impressively delicious!  Expect to wait...if you're impatient there are plenty of others who are willing to wait (me included) for 40+ minutes on a very empty stomach.

Unlike its sister restaurants (FEZ and Switch) Ticoz had a few things to overcome, less than ideal location, a difficult name to remember, and service with a rocky reputation.  It seems though that over the last year Ticoz has started to come into it's own. Service has definitely improved and the food has remained pretty high quality.  There is one change however that I truly lament: Their chips and 3 varieties of salsa is no longer complimentary :(

It's as yummy as it sounds! I've been known to only order their sides for a meal, they're super delishhhh. The Honey Roasted Carrot are a MUST. If you think you don't like carrots, get that look of disgust off your face long enough to savor this delight.  If you're into burgers (I'm usually not), you must try their BBQ Bacon Burger. Also, if you're looking for recommendations a lot of people swear by the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad.

Ok, as promised I went back. Truth is I've been back several times now, and it just keeps getting better. [Ms Aguilera, would you kindly get out of my head.]  Most recently I went for happy hour (an excellent plan). Half price on all glasses of wine and their fun cocktails are only $5 each. Bam!  The Forbidden Rice Bowl lured me into it's blasphemous clutches and I couldn't have been happier. Highly recommended!  Again, the Cucumber cooler should not be missed, even at full price!

Friendly staff with many levels of authenticity. The gelato and sorbet we both very creamy and rich. After sitting at one of the dining tables I fell into a trance that forced me to moon over all the fun and interesting Italian ingredients.  I got the cheese sampler or Framaggio, super fun and tasty.

For pure delight, I have to give this place 5 stars.   YOU MUST TRY: Very Berry Turkey Sandwich, Thai Braised Beef Tacos, Apricot BBQ Chicken Skewers, and the Red Sangria!   I also highly recommend the Sunday Brunch Drink Specials; the mimosas and bloody Mary drinks are $3. They fill one glass up and bring you the rest of your drink in a carafe. They're strong and after just one you'll be pretty happy :D   Other items worth noting: Margarita Sunrise, Blueberry Cosmo, Drunk Italian Soda

This bar is hit or miss. I wouldn't recommend going here with the intention of meeting new people. Most are creepy, cliquy, or bitchy. It's a good place to meet your friends at on the way to another bar. There is a light rail stop near by so it makes traveling to Amsterdam or Charlie's easy.  The place is small, but that didn't keep the owner from installing a lighting system intended for a dance floor even though they only play dance music sometimes; the whole concept is pretty half baked.

The people here are friendly, in a distract-you-while-they-roofie-your-drink kind of way; so bring a friend :)   The lighting is low except in the bathroom where it's blinding. Anvil caters to the leather community, which can be interesting...makes for good people watching. Just don't give off the vibe you're curious (unless you really are). That's likely to get you unwanted attention pretty quick.  They have a special on Friday; if you walk around in your underwear drinks are $1 off. Personally, if my clothes are going to be half off the drink better be too.  I have friends that like this place (and pay for my drinks), otherwise I wouldn't go.  If you're tired of Charlie's or Amsterdam, this could be construed as a change of pace/scene, which can be nice.

Surprise! No seriously, I never know what to expect from Icepics. Their seasonal "Glee" nights draw a very diverse crowd of pretty low-key people; those are my favorite. I can usually get a group of friends to come too.  I'm not a fan of Go-Go Boy nights in general, but there is extra loathing here. Some of the strippers are so nasty and skanky it makes me sick to my stomach. Others are decent, but I avoid those nights.  Recently I accidently came during their underwear night.  "Clothes half-off = Drinks half-off" I didn't play that game, but there were a number of patrons who did. There were more than just a few unpleasant views there, and I'm not just talking about the overweight elderly man who not only sported a thong, but went the next step and pulled the front of his shirt over his head to make sure everyone knew how fat he was; also, there was a barely legal display of porn on the various video screens. It was very clear what was going on, but the parts of interest were juuuuuuust out of view. Classy.

IcePics has some of the best drink specials in town, not to mention the strongest. I'm not kidding, bring a DD. The bartender on Tuesday nights makes me what he calls a Patron Cosmo. OMG, yuuuuuumerz! After three of those you'll be transported to a world where everything is wonderful and hope abounds ;)  There still are nights to avoid/support depending on the company and your dis/likes  Karaoke nights are best if you wanna hang with your straight friends. Underwear night, best if you're a voyeur and/or exhibitionist Stripper nights best for those of you who like to pay for NSA or appreciate the skin of a stranger.  I still go here almost every week with friends for drinks and new episodes of Glee. Good times, noodle salad (if you get that reference then you are super cool and we should be friends!)

RAVE ALERT!   This place has an AWESOME happy hour! I mean super awesome. The line on their menu describing the food as "Authentic flavors refined" is too accurate to improve upon!   All the things that usually make me want to sprint in the opposite direction of an Indian restaurant: buffet style setup, clashing colors, poor presentation, poor service and funky smells were not present at Bombay Spice. In other words, the experience was much less of a culture shock for me; elegant and modern style decor, dine-ware and silverware did the trick.   The staff was very friendly and helpful. I can't wait to go back! I had the Indian chai latte, Chicken Tikka, Samosa and Carrot Halwa. Total bill before tip: $5.74. How can I not give this place 5 stars? I mean, seriously!   WHAT I'D RECOMMEND:  Going for their amazing happy hour, as well as their Indian chai latte, Chicken Tikka, Samosa and Carrot Halwa

Didn't expect to like this, being raw and all, but I love sushi so...bam...loved it. Rib Eye Steak, holy cow! Seriously...Foodgasm!  When I'm rich and famous (wait, I don't care about being famous)...ok when I'm rich I'm going to be a regular. I'm gonna be so FAT! Average American fat :D

If an alcoholic beverage could be described as beautiful tasting then Sens' moonstone coconut lemongrass sake earns it. I'm a fan of unfiltered sake and this one was delicious tasting, smelling.  The Wasabi Tofu was also excellent. I was skeptical of the dessert wonton, but I enjoyed it's subtle sweetness.

What do the Tuck Shop and a Drag Queen have in common? They both tuck there assets away so that it's difficult to find them and when you see them perform they have a lot of surprises.  After several recommendations and a lot of rave reviews on Yelp I finally visited this neighborhood gem.  I definitely recommend the Pasta Fries, Stuffed Medjool Dates, Baby Lettuce Salad, and Chicken & Waffles. I've never had such juicy and tender chicken that was this crispy before. Awesome!   By the way, I didn't have all those dishes to myself or even during the same visit so keep your judgements to yourself :P

Truth be told, great happy hour. Very strong drinks, we all know I'm a fan of that :) I just had to try the Lemoncello Margarita, I mean come on...awesome idea! I loved it.  It was hard to find parking close to the place though. Something nearby must be REALLY popular, because it was packed. I was nervous there wouldn't be enough room for my group, but surprisingly there was...plenty.  RECOMMENDATIONS: Lemoncello Margarita, and the Tempura Green Beans!

Save this place for a special occasion: anniversary, special birthday, to-impress date, Valentine's day...and go ALL out! Posh doesn't have a traditional menu; in fact, they don't have a menu at all. Come prepared with a desire for adventure and a unique experience. I ordered a 5-course dinner accompanied with wine, and that's what I recommend you do.  INSTRUCTIONS FOR EATING HERE: 1. Make a reservation 2. Come with a healthy appetite 3. Budget about $120 per person. 4. Take a look at their list of daily ingredients and cross off anything you know you won't like or have an allergy to. 5. Have an open mind, based on what you select (or cross out) the chief decides what to serve you (personally, this is part of the appeal. It gave me a chance to experience things that I might have otherwise not chosen.) 6. Savor every bite of cuisine and sip of wine.

Very pleasant hip restaurant. Try as many Bruchetta options as you can; each order comes with 4 pieces (potentially 4 different toppings), and all the ones I got were delicious: Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, and Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil.

What to choose, what to choose. Such difficult decisions! Seriously, this normally isn't a problem. Dispite the fact that I'm a libra, I'm very decisive. Friends usually look to me to make all sorts of decisions ::diabolical laugh:: Still, this place consistently stumps me.  Is it Tuesday? If yes, then I'm definately getting the Pork Belly Tacos.  Otherwise, I'll start with an order of Ceviche and Asado Salad.  To drink I'll have Agua Fresca de Sabor.  Yes, I'm going to have an entre too, I mean I've already broken my diet, might as well :D  I'll have the Huevos Rancheros or 3 Carne Asada Tacos or the Verduras de Temporada or the Chilaquiles Verdes or the Carne Asada Torta. OMG, so many great options! Seriously, this normally isn't a problem. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to try everything.  Next up, a euphoric food coma! Life is good.

This place used to be a beauty parlor, hence the name. I love the atmosphere in this place and the food is so fresh and deeeelish.  I tired the Agnolotti pasta special with heirloom tomatoes and squash blossoms. The blossoms were deep fried tempura style, very crispy. The pasta was to die for and the veggies were so fresh and juicy!  I cannot recommend the cellos enough. They make lemoncello, orangecello, and blood orangecello. All are excellent and VERY strong. They come in a mini wine glass.

I hate my birthday, I do mean hate here. Still my good friend insisted on treating me to dinner at Crudo for it.  Fortunately this place offered a positive association with that aweful date.  The menu was fresh and interesting, offering a lot of items I had never considered food (i.e. Squid Ink). Their menu is always changing so it'll often offer some unique surprises.  The most perplexing thing about the experience was that Crudo is tucked inside an upscale Salon (this also made it a little more challenging to find). This made the restaurant seem like more of a hobby for the salon, but if that's the case they're very passionate about their hobbies :)

This small restaurant is definately worth a try, but call ahead for reservations, they're very busy. I found the menu exciting and interesting; I litterally wanted to try everything. I did end up having the rainbow valley butter | radishes | local honey comb | cashews, the salad of lady apple | crispy prosciutto | pecans | blue cheese, and the grilled spicy broccoli | meyer lemon aioli | pistachio. They were all amazing, it was a euphoric experience.

Yet another home retrofitted into an awesome restaurant.  I'm instantly drawn to the "Hot Sandwich" section of the menu; I've tried The Sheridan, RB & C, Cash Money, and The Jive Turkey (Yes...all in one visit...kidding, jeez. Are you trying to say I'm fat?). All were exceptional, but my favorite is the Sheridan.   Also, the beverage menu is well rounded, I'd be surprised if you couldn't find something to please your palette here. Most recently I tried the Sonoran White Chocolate Ale (locally brewed) which was quite good. I accidentally had two glasses ;)

This place looks pretty rough from the outside, and is easy to miss. On the inside; however, it's quite comfortable and nice. I'm a fan of Horchata in general, but I have to say La Condesa has the best I've ever had. Also, they managed to change my opinion about Mole with their Mole Chicken taco.   The salsa bar has no equal! Cilantro Salsa, Jicama Salsa, Peanut Salsa, the list goes on an on. You can experience what seems like enless and amazing combinations of flavors.  I'm definitely going back!

I must have serious bad luck because my experience was far from 4 stars.  Staff was cold, unfriendly and inattentive. The prosecco, red wine and Bordeaux Baked Brie were awful.  Maybe I should give it another chance, but I doubt I'll be able to work up the motivation (unless someone dragged me there, hint hint).

Very clean and organized with decent prices, but doesn't have the character, charm, and interesting assortment of goods like Trader Joe's. My favorite thing to do near closing time is pick up some stuff that's been marked down 'cause it won't be as "fresh" the next day.

Where to begin? I can't deny that the chef/owner is a reflective business man, but to put it mildly he's lacking in customer service skills.  I'd tried to get in to use a coupon I'd purchased for $25 dollars at least 3 times before I actually made it in.  Attempt one: "We don't accept reservations this late." (The coupon required a reservation)  Attempt two: "We're not open this late on Sundays" (It was 7pm)  Attempt three: "We're not open, doing construction on the patio."  In each attempt mentioned above, a man answered the phone and seemed to begrudge my attempts to patron his business with a tone in his voice and curtness in his reply.  The final time I attempted to make a reservation a woman answered, she was much more professional and customer-service oriented. (Maybe she should be in charge of answering the phone. Hint. Hint.)  After arriving I was informed that my coupon had expired; $25 wasted. The owner said he felt bad about it, and gave us a few free drinks. I was livid. However, I felt a little better after the pretentious European wine (very mediocre tasting). The salad was disappointing, the cheese overpowered it. I might have been happier with just a wedge of cheese on a plate.  The friend a brought with me added chicken to his salad and got food poisoning.  I think I should be forgiven for the one-star review, the rating is well deserved.

This eclectic restaurant with a Japanese cuisine focus is somewhat difficult to locate, but worth it. You must try the Okonomiyaki. It's a common Japanese dish that most Americans have never heard of. It's very delicious in general, but Nobuo takes it to the next level.

Grab your hula skit and bring your shaka attitude!   Maui Dog is an oasis of the quarky combos that you rarely find anywhere other than the beautiful Hawaiian Archipiélago. It's small and fun and full of tasteful, effective thematic decor.  I tried the Tiki Dog (amazing! I was tempted to order another right then and there!) The red cream soda (free refills!) was also good. The fries, however, weren't the best.

Sad face :( It's closed. I hope they just relocated.

One star for the staff, they really are great and personable; another star for the design and aesthetics of the building.  A couple of things that really detract from the experience here: 1. Pet Urine. The residents here are very inconsiderate with their pets. The property even has a designated patch of grass for the dogs to take care of business, but a large percentage of of the people living here think it's fine if their dog pees on the sidewalk, steps, and even in the elevators. 2. Paper-thin walls and ceilings. I could hear my upstairs neighbor's digital alarm, when she was opening and closing her dresser drawers, walking, moving stuff, etc. 3. Residents parking in the visitor parking spots. Anytime I invited friends over all the parking was taken by cars that were there every day.  This place has a lot of potential, but too many of the people who manage to rent here are low class and inconsiderate.  Raise your prices Level. :) Cheers.

Ummm, ya, crunchy...groovy? Unexpected, unapologetic; it does what it wants and does it well. A random coffee house that also serves fun crepes. In the mood for something different, but worthy? Set GPS to "JoBot Coffee".

The staff here is awesome, especially at the bar! We asked the chef about what she put in the empanadas to make them so great; she was super nice and personable, not to mention forthcoming.   Even though I really like Fuego Bistro (same owners), I have to admit all the food here really has that extra something (maybe it's the chef? Hells ya.) Also, the decor and ambiance at Tacos caters to a more trendy, urban customer. Tacos is more polished, slightly funky, and modern; whereas the bistro is a more traditional Caribbean-style place.   I love their Sangrias, especially the red one. Still the spiced pear sangria is very interesting. It doesn't taste exactly like what you'd expect, but worth a try.   RECOMMENDATION: Come for their happy hour and TRY EVERYTHING!

I admit of a weakness and recurring craving for their Quinoa Tabbouleh (gluten-free and vegan) which only appears on their lunch menu, but they'll serve it to you for dinner as well.  I have to recommend their beverages even though they are pricey. I'm always game for interesting flavors and combinations, and for the most part True Food gets it right.  If you have dietary restrictions give this place a try.  Most of the plates have subtle flavors so if you prefer robust and spicy True Food probably isn't for you. However, if you like to feel healthy after a meal; TF gets a thumbs up!

How? How? HOW do you make pizza taste that bland? It's astounding! I don't think I could bake a purer form of disappointment if I tried.  Even more surprising was the number of patrons that were there, and more surprising still I see signs announcing new locations. Jeez.  Too expensive and not yummy, move along.

You know when everyone seems to love something, but then you experience it for yourself and it's very anticlimactic? Well, that's how I feel about this joint. I just don't get it. It's so average, nothing special. Still people rave like they're having an orgasm.  I'm sure this will sound like am an elitist, but I guess if your only options were Burger King, Wendy's, or McDonalds this place might deserve 3 stars.

A very unique and excellent place for a first date. Lounge areas abound, and the indie movies are a fresh treat. Sip wine or chug a beer while to devour film culture.

Expectations were low; I admit I was tempted to turn my nose up. I mean come on, it's an evil chain. Still, the food is decent and the prices are something to consider. I left satisfied and willing to admit I'd come back. I wouldn't describe it as "fabulous" like another reviewer, but it has a place in my book.

Very quaint place with personable staff. I tried the Iced Toddy (love that for a beverage name, I couldn't help but think of "Hot Toddy, Hot Toddy" from Will & Grace :) It was quite flavorful. I added Skim Milk and Agave Nectar to it. Yum! Had I not been on a very strict diet I'd have tried some of their delicious looking pastries...so in other words, I'll be back!

While coaching on deck at the Y, I managed to drop my iPhone flat, face down. It didn't fall hard, I've actually dropped it much harder in the past. Still, when I flipped it over the whole face was brutally shattered. Fortunately it continued to respond to my touch, with the added sensation of cutting me albeit on a microscopic level.    As more and more slivers of glass fell from its face I concluded that a repair could not wait, so I located Mac Masters with the Yelp App.    It did cross my mind to go to the Apple store, but I find they grossly overvalue their services. Hell, all they really need is a security guard, because now you can check out using the Apple Store App.    The Mac Masters' services were more expensive than I was hoping for, but I was very satisfied with my beautiful new pimped-out iPhone. Metallic blue face, new metallic silver case and battery upgrade left me with a smile that continues to this day :)

This is now my destination for all cards.   At any other point in my life I was the last person to give a card (they seemed more like clutter than anything). When I give one of their cards I get so many compliments, and the card gets prime real estate in my friends' home.  Yes, they are expensive...but if you save it for very special occasions (x-mas, valentine's, mother's day, b-day of your girl/boyfriend) it's manageable.

I don't drink coffee, my tummy doesn't like it...well I should say it gets VERY angry when I drink even diluted coffee drinks.  The interior is trendy urban industrial, and there's a huge fan to keep their covered outside area as cool as possible (still not cool in AZ summer, but I appreciate the obvious effort).  I've only had two drinks here: the iced chai latte and the orange blossom beer, both of which went down quick and well.  Orange Blossom Beer is locally brewed and has a persistent orange sicle note. Yum!

Vegan desserts in the AZ desert. Is this an episode of the twilight zone?   It's just a testament to the growing diversity in body, mind and palette here everyday.  I love the fact that I eat their ice cream and don't feel fat afterwards.

A vegan place with familiar flavors; don't get me wrong, I love new and interesting cuisine I just think this place will make veganity (is that a word?) accessible to more people.  RECOMMENDATION: Try the crab puffs and the secret bbq chicken sandwich!

Best experience I've ever had at a salon. I absolutely loved everyone who worked there and even the other clients. Everyone was so friendly and I loved my cut and color too.  I don't tend to like the experience of getting my hair done. I'm always self conscious, I'm not sure why; it's just my silly brain being silly in one of its many ways. I often like the product of getting my hair cut, but I don't like the process.  I enjoyed the whole experience at PureSalon. They even gave me some cheese and crackers along with a glass of wine. Awesome!   I'm totally going back. I think I'm in love.

With the lack of clientele (we were literally the only people there), the cook hanging out the serving window bored to tears, and absentee greeter I was not prepared to be impressed.  The veggie pizza was really good!  I'm concerned this hippe little place may disappear despite what it's got going for it, I asked the server if they're usually busier; they're allegedly seeking new management.  Good Luck Miami! I hope you make it!

Shine now has a brick-and-mortar location right off of central on Vernon (North of McKellips, South of Thomas). The service is great! I always get a Iced Soy Chai! Yum!   The location is absolutely adorable, tiny!

Oh Em Jeezus! Thank gawd for friends who have the skinny on awesome new places!  I went here for a friend-of-a-friend's birthday and I had no idea what to expect. I kept forgetting the name so didn't look it up like usual. I have to say, this place would firmly stand against the onslaught of my highest expectations, but since I had none it made the experience stellar!  The Arizona Mule, recommended by the server, was great. It came in a tin cup and you guested it, it was pricey. $12+  True to form I was drawn to the most unfamiliar and mysterious items on the menu: Compressed Watermelon and crispy feta (unfamiliar, not to mention gorgeous), and the Trilogy of Bruschetta (mysterious). Both were a welcome and sweet/savory revelation!  I need a raise so I can frequent this place, I totally recommend it for anytime you want to pamper your palette.

After riding my bike from Central Phoenix to Mill Ave and forgetting to eat breakfast I was ready to mow down.  Fate and Yelp were merciful; after entering  "vegan" into the search field Desert Roots Kitchen appeared on the map not 100 feet away.  I thoroughly enjoyed their wrap, omg! Their generous servings had me full and ready for another workout.

No more shipping fees for me! This local business holds a special place in my heart. I'm on my fourth bottle of Chili Olive Oil, a truly inspired and essential part of my kitchen now.  There are many zesty and dreamy flavors like Bacon, Blood Orange, Mexican Lime, Vanilla Bean, etc. Oh, and you can try them all at this beautiful shoppe.  They have other locally made products as well;  soaps, pastas, skin care products, accessories and more.  Yet another reason to visit Kierland Commons. Damn, as if that place wasn't dangerous enough.
