1 star simply because I called from the parking lot to ask the wait- was told no wait, walked in 3 seconds later and was told a 15 minute wait.

I think this place is often overlooked. The drunken noodles are fabulous! It's kind of hidden next to the 'Dollar' theatre, but worth trying!

I'm going to start with four stars for the Castle. We booked here last weekend and the spot is amazing. I love the feel and the idea of the greenery and artifacts in the back which give for great after-ceremony photos (exactly what most of the venues in the city are missing). My biggest gripe is with their 'soft holds policy'. Personally, I have no issues with this. So, after touring on a Saturday and falling in love, I tell them my fianc√© and I will be back the next weekend with family because we want to lock down our October date that is still open. They tell us thats great, set an appointment, but again make it clear they cannot do a 'soft hold'.   The following Saturday 9 of us show up. Tell them we're probably going to book, and they mention another bride is INTERESTED...There are no soft holds though, so it shouldn't matter-right? So while I'M there touring with my family, the owner calls the other bride telling her there is someone else touring that is REALLY interested (I witnessed the call first-hand when I walked in to their office to ask for pricing to show my dad whom hadn't seen it). The owner is on the phone for a long while, and comes back to say 'the other bride is on her way down (!!!!!) but it's whoever gets the money in our hand first that gets the date, since we don't do soft holds'. When my dad says alright, we're ready, the owner says 'I don't want you making a rash decision because you feel pressure'.   At this point I'm almost ready to cry out of pure frustration, and tell the owner point blank, 'If we walk out now so you can talk to the other bride, we will not be back'.   Ultimately we got the date we wanted, and the other bride got her secondary date, and came over to congratulate us after booking. Kudos to the other bride, but hopefully The Castle owners will provide for a better experience going forward and not make us regret investing thousands in this place.   Will update as things progress, and hopefully be able to increase the stars because I do think the place is absolutely stunning.

Their chicken is unbelievable! I could eat their chicken with Tzaziki and Pita every day. Steer clear of the fries, they tend to be a bit overcooked.

Never had a bad experience here. The burgers are great and the fries are even better!

If Nosh implements a bruschetta & wine deal- move over Postino! Also try the Beets over Kale- fantastic!
