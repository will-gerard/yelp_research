After enjoying happy hour a couple years ago, I finally had a chance to eat at My Wine Cellar a couple weeks ago and had a wonderful time!  We were greeted by the staff immediately, and were offered a seat on the patio as there was live music.  The musician was fantastic and added the perfect ambiance for a nice dinner.  Our waitress was Sharon, and she had good knowledge of the menu suggesting a great red wine for myself and a beer for my boyfriend.  We decided to order a cheese plate, and I have to admit this was the one thing we were disappointed by.  The cheese was good, however it was a small portion.  The prosciutto was a bit too sweet and neither of us chose to finish the portion we were served.  Onto the entrees...we decided to go with the flat breads and share so we could sample two.  The boy chose the classic, no mushroom.  It was very flavorful and generous on the toppings.  The second was absolutely delicious!  I went with the Bacon and Squash and was impressed by the richness of the toppings without being overpowering.  Definitely a must try!  Next time we will probably go with the bruschetta to start, as we saw a few being served and they looked tasty.  Our waitress suggested dessert, however the meal was filling and we did not save room.  Overall the experience was wonderful for a date night!  The live music was not overpowering, and there was even a large birthday party going on that did not take over our experience.   The restaurant itself was nice, very open and accommodating for happy hour, however the patio really hit home for us and I am glad we sat outside.  4.5 stars for food and drink, bumped up a notch for the live music.    Definitely a must try if you like personal attention from the wait staff, good wine, and a beautiful patio to enjoy your meal on.

I have been a patient of the office for 4-5 years now, and have had great service every year.  The office is clean and well run, and Dr. Betsko and her staff are extremely efficient!  There is never a wait, and prices are reasonable for cash paying patients like myself.  A couple of years ago I had some issues with my contacts, and Dr. Betsko saw me multiple times in a week time period to help resolve the issue (which turned out to be an allergy to the product).   During my last visit Johna helped me select some new glasses, which I absolutely love!  I always recommend the office to anyone looking for eye care in the area, and everyone always comments on having a similar experience to mine.  They recently started with a text message reminder system that reminds you about upcoming appointments and also let you know when your glasses/contacts are in.  Handy for a busy person like myself!

In all fairness, I am yet to have a "full meal" here, but have been to happy hour a couple of times for wine and appetizers.  This is a GREAT place if you like good wine for reasonable prices.  I have had a few of the reds off the $5/glass menu, along with the bruchetta and butternut squash ravioli...delicious!  The happy hour lasts until 7 which is perfect for those that work and can't get to the 'till 6pm type.  My friend got the Ahi Tuna app and declared it delightful.  I have to say the best part of my experience has been the bartenders, as we sit at the bar to enjoy conversation with them.  I find them to be not only friendly, but also entertaining.  I'll definitely be back here for more HH in the future.

After reading reviews that "this is the best chinese food in the valley!" my boyfriend and I decided to get some takeout tonight from them.  Their website doesn't have a menu, so I sent the boy away with orders to get me a garlic chicken dish.  I want to give this a single star, however my bf claims his food was better than mine so I'll up it to a two.  Mine was plain terrible.  I have had far better, and in fact had to add some black bean sauce from my fridge to add some flavor to it.  Literally no flavor OR spice in fact.  Ben got chicken fried rice, and the pan fried shrimp.  He said the fried rice was terrible, shrimp was average.  Steamed rice was kinda crunchy, just your average quick cook rice.  Now we are used to east coast takeout, so maybe we've been spoiled but I certainly won't be eating here again.  Bummer because I was really hoping to find a kick ass chinese take-out place close to home.  The search goes on...

This was one of the first places I ate after moving to Phoenix, and I must say I was impressed.  Slightly overpriced, but delicious none-the-less. I've never eaten in the restaurant, only ordered take-out so I cannot comment on the service (hence 4 stars).  For all you fans out there....the map does not show the correct location for the store.  It used to be near the Wal-Mart off Elliot and I-10, but has since moved to 1805 East Elliot Road #115, off McClintock and Elliot.

I had my first meal at Miele's last night, and was pleasantly surprised.  I purchased a Groupon to the restaurant a month or so ago, and am glad that I did because otherwise may not have noticed this cute place amongst it's neighbors in the strip mall.  We started with the brochette, and spent the next 10 minutes raving about how amazing it was.  The tomatoes were crisp and fresh, the chopped garlic was very complimentary, and the oil had a fantastic flavor.  Definitely a good choice.  For dinner I had the spaghetti and meatballs and my boy had the chicken toscana.  Both had a very authentic Italian flavor that accompanies food made with care.  The meatballs were everything I was craving...a little spicy and filled with flavor.  My portion left enough for leftovers, but Brent ate his entire meal.  We both left with a full belly and intentions to return again soon.  I have no complaints about the food (delicious!), but docked the restaurant a star for two reasons:  1. The lights are way too bright.  While I appreciate that the restaurant is more casual than some Italian joints I've been to, a dimmer switch on the overhead lights could do wonders for the atmosphere!  2.  One of my favorite treats at Italian restaurants is bread dipped in tasty olive oil with fresh ground pepper and Parmesan cheese.  The bread is delicious, but the prepackaged butter that accompanied it didn't impress me.  I also would have liked freshly ground Parmesan on my spaghetti.  We noticed a lot of pizzas being picked up for takeout, and both thought the bar looked like a cute little place to come have a drink and a bite sometime.  Highly recommended and a great way to support a local business owner in Tempe!

I reallly want to like you Moe's.  I do.  I live so close and you are sooo convenient.  BUT.... I ventured out for a taco salad last week, excited for some mexican delicousness with a side of my favorite condiment, guac.  What I got was a flavorless chicken salad with so so guac on the side.  Even my bf agreed my guac is better and not only am I not a "cook", I am also not of Mexican heritage.  I expected much much better.  Dang.  I am still looking for that authentic Mexican taste in a quick take out, and I know it's out there...

I started going to the studio in June 2008 after a friend convinced me to check it out and have been hooked since!  The variety of classes is great, and the times they have available make things soooo convenient. (6am workout anyone??!!)  I even took a certification course they hosted, and now teach 4 classes a week.    The best part is the free intro class so you can try before you buy!

I work in the same complex as Great Harvest, so I end up stopping in out of convenience for a coffee on occasion.  Pretty decent coffee, but I'll drink anything that isn't weak like Dunkin Donuts (sorry Dunks...love your donuts though!) coffee.  The best part about this coffee ritual is the "sample" of bread they offer you.  Seriously, this has been my breakfast on more than one occasion.  So so tasty!  There is nothing better than freshly baked bread topped with flavored butter/jam, and the fact it is a good sized portion is a bonus!  I have also had their turkey sandwich, and found it to be good as well.  The bread definitely makes the sandwich taste very homemade.  I like that the store is family owned (within a franchise), as it is obvious a lot of hard work goes into the workings of the store.  In my opinion it's worth shelling out an extra buck if it's going to a family vs corporate america.  But...on the money note....I had to dock a star for the prices.  I would love to buy their bread, but really can't afford $7 for a loaf.  Their jams are also a bit more than I am willing to spend, or I'd have one of every flavor in my fridge! It doesn't keep me away...I just try to keep my visits spaced out a bit more.  Kudos Great Harvest!

I love the TV shows that show a group of friends, and "their" bar.  Since moving to Tempe, I haven't found that bar....that is, until now.  I LOVE  this place!  I work nearby, so I stopped by after work for a drink one night.  What I got was a whole lotta fun, delish Coronas, and sliders to kill for!   Then things got even better...they invented ladies night!  I can meet my girls for happy hour every Wednesday and expect to pay less that $10 for food and drinks....tell me somewhere else you can find a deal like this!  I've taken family members here for lunch, and they all found the food delish.  All around a great place for lunch and/or HH/dinner.  The environment is fun, and I felt comfortable hanging out at the bar alone waiting for my friends to show up.  The bar staff is very friendly and keep me entertained!  Two thumbs up...keep it up guys!

Let me start by saying that I LOVE farmers markets.  In my opinion it is the way to start a great weekend day.  That being said...I was really disappointed by the Ahwatukee market.  Maybe it was my high hopes going in, but I felt the variety was less than awesome, and the number of booths set up was much less than i was expecting.  The reason I go to Farmers Markets is to support the local farmers, and for the opportunity to buy produce that is more fresh than most grocery stores carry.  I was really turned off by the Jamba Juice stand and the booth from the bread store...these are both chain "restaurants" and in my opinion have no place at a local farmers market.  If I feel like a smoothie, I'll go home with my fresh fruit and make one!    I also felt the prices were a bit high, but can imagine the costs go up here just like anywhere else feeling the pinch right now so won't include that in the rating.  Overall...I'll go back but certainly don't make it a weekend ritual like I did with markets back east.  Bummer ;(

Christie (the owner) has a FANTASTIC concept in what she has created with Express MiE.  The passion she brings to dance is definitely what sets her studio apart from others!  I've known Christie since the pre-studio days...back when she hosted pole-ah-tease and lap dance parties at her house.  I am so excited that she has expanded and now owns a full service dance studio!   When I was first invited to check a class out, I had no idea what to expect...and was definitely a bit nervous.  Pole dancing?  Eek!  Coming from a self-proclaimed "non-dancer"...I had a blast!  Christie and the other teachers understand the "first timer" jitters, and have you forgetting about them in no time.  The new studio is....well....GORGEOUS.  It is apparent a lot of time and energy went into creating the space, as each room seems to fit the type of dance taught perfectly.  In addition to the dance studios, there is a "lounge" where you can hang out with the girls after class.  Oh did I mention girls only?  That's right ladies....let those inhibitions run free!  Lastly, for those of you that are skeptical of the actual "workout" you get...the morning after I tried the lap dance class I woke up with a body screaming for an epsom salt bath!  This is a great way to add some variety to your workouts.

I actually have to credit my boyfriend for this place...we had some ok pizza when first moving to town, and I was less than excited to try another random place.  We came from the East Coast, so the boy was real excited to come across these guys.  They left a doorknob hanger on our condo door, so I guess some marketing tactics do work...  This is the only pizza we get now, and on top of the great tasting 'za they honor the coupons over and over again.....  We'll be back for more!

I've been into this shop a couple times, and have always had a good experience.  This past weekend, we were up for a early bike ride and thought we'd grab an iced coffee on our way.  Unfortunately we were disappointed to find they do not open until 8am on Sundays.  That being said, the girls inside opened the door and welcomed me in at 7:40.  In the midst of getting ready to open they prepared me a couple coffees to go and helped another couple there early as well.  Great customer service!  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  The barista asked what I wanted my coffee like, and nailed it!  Decor inside is cute and looks like a cozy place to go read once it cools down.  Good music is another plus ;)  Coffee is a little on the spendy side, but then again, you get what you pay for.  No over roasted beans here people.  Docked a star due to lack of early hours on the weekend, but service and coffee are superb.  Might have to grab a scone next time as they looked phenomenal!

When it comes to buying a new home, we all know having a quality home inspection is one of the most important steps to take.  I've heard horror stories about home inspectors spending 10 minutes "checking out the property", or missing issues that can become expensive repairs down the road.   Not the case with Rich and AccuPro! I've had the pleasure to know Rich for a couple of years, and am always amazed at his knowledge when it comes to build defects or residences not being up to code. In addition to being completely thorough, Rich is also honest and will tell you exactly what he finds.  Whether you are building a new home, buying an existing property, or concerned you may have a mold problem Rich will take care of you.
