I love I here! It's a big church with a small church feel! Everyone says hello and is helpful! I must say they have the best nursery director ever! But I may be a little bias  ! !

by far the best sub I have ever had! I have searched for other sub places to compare and nothing comes close! The staff at this one (I have one been to this one) is very nice! I took my son in there and they gave him a fireman's hat and he was so excited! its always clean when we have gone. I crave their food! I get the Italian every time!

I have to give his place a 5 star this is the first place all 4 of us (my kids included) will eat the same thing! My youngest hates pizza has never eaten it! So normally we have to order him something completely different! But today when we ordered from cheezheadz we all ate the pizza!! It was amazing ! Nicely done!

Food is about a 3.5 but the service is not the best. We went in the day the had promoted (for a month) their $1 taco day. Put a reminder in m phone and took the girls from work they without notice canceled it the girl at the window talk to us like we were morons! We showed her the Facebook post and still talked to poorly. Then once we made a comment on the post on the Facebook promotion saying we were there it was taken down no apology... I just think it's bad business.... I'd rather go spend money at a sit down that actually knows how to run a place than a place thy can't even run a Facebook lol but as well the food is a little over priced for the taste not by too much but for two people you can easily spend over $25 there are much better places to spend your money!
