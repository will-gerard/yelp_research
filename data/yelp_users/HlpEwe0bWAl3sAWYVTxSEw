My first impression was the nice and wonderful greetings from staff. The young man who also helped had no issue assisting me on finding a holster. He is nice, courteous and helped me pick the best fit for me. The officer at the shooting range was cool for showing me how the basic operation of my gun. I had a great time and look forward to the great atmosphere

Great atmosphere and good customer service. I like the little outdoor space area it's pretty and quaint and you get to see the traffic go by, hear the birds chirp, it's pretty good.

Manager's. Coach your employees which window is what. When a customer is pulling up. The first window is #1 to us not #2. There's no signs. They need to listen and pay attention. This is the 2nd huge mishap. #1. this job isn't that hard. Horrible!!!!

After a year I thought I would try to see if anything got better.... I did NOT. My food was cold. I had to get my own chili sauce since the waiters were doing nothing,  cause it wasn't even that busy. Took forever to just get my sprite in the first place too.  Won't return. Horrible service and cold meat.

While my visit to this Dollar Tree on Peoria Avenue in Phoenix Arizona off of I 17 and 28th Drive. Was the most rude and disgusting behavior from a manager that was so racist and so profoundly loud yelling at one of the employees which happens to be an African American young boy. It was so loud the whole store got quiet. Korina the manager was screaming at him because he called for backup. It's the worst thing I've witnessed. While I was asking one of the other employees for a district managers number all of a sudden Karina popped up. She said there is no district managers number they can give me and gave me corporates number and was very rude and disgusting again. Got him off the register, I witnessed all the  cacusation females laughing about the situation this is total racist and discrimination which happens to be strictly employed by Caucasian. #Racist #Discrimination #Managerisabitch #Dollartree

Sad! You want your patient there by 3:30pm. I left work early.. so not only are you wasting my time, my job, my money! I don't care if he's stupid and running behind,  that's not my issue. You want patients at a certain time. Then YOU be present for the patient at that time! Further more it took 3 calls.. no one called back. Still yet not even the "dr." Then i had to leave a message w a MA. Yet the drugs they push aren't working! This is not my incompetence of "dr".  Islam Aj.. whatever their called.  Maybe you should be billed for my time and loss at of pay at work!!!!!!!!!  And you're incapability to do your "job".

Very disappointing for a new place to have opened and have such nasty attitudes, before even getting in line... stood looked, walked right back out. Looked over priced and not good anyways though.

This great restaurant is very well kept. I had the opportunity to meet the owners, one being Nana Tee.  They have a great variety from hot dogs that come in many different loaded formations. To different kind of hamburgers to specially made sandwiches. Although for me I enjoyed a great delicious green chile chicken burrito! The environment there was very welcoming for anybody and everybody! I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. Enjoy!
