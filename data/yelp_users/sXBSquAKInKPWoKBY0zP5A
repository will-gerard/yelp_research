I've been visiting this place regularly for months now. They recently got new pedi chairs & this week's color combo with her skills gave me a great holiday pedi!

Sonny was a great mechanic! I had some problems with my battery & he arrived sooner than expected. He was friendly, helpful & very knowledgeable. He fixed the problem quickly & we were on our way in under 30 min. It was a dream come true! Thank you, Sonny!

It was my first time here. I came for a show. The local band, Fillabusta, performed there.  Good News:  The band was great!  The atmosphere is a cool - vibe mix of Coffeehouse/bar/restaraunt, the bathrooms are clean, stocked, & nice.  The location is beautiful.  Bad news: Slightly understaffed for a busy Friday night. No waitresses outside, you have to go to the bar to order/get refills...  Customer Service lacking. The girls are so busy they can't focus on a good customer experience. The pizza was terrible. Too much bad quality cheese, doughy & chewy yet still burned on the bottom. Also, no plates or silverware for your pizza, you're at a bar, not a restaurant...wait? Isn't this a ... Which is it?
