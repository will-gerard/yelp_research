Great bagels, yummy coffee. The people are awesome. I come for breakfast at least once a week!

I attended a wedding here. During cocktail hour, I mentioned to one of the servers that I have a shellfish allergy. More than an hour later at dinner, a different server came to my table to confirm my allergy as there was shrimp on the menu. They wanted to make sure there was no shrimp on my plate. I was pretty impressed!

Thanks for being rude when you got my order wrong and then just transferring the incorrect cheese from one sandwich to the other instead of putting new cheese on both sandwiches. Now my sandwich tastes like an everything bagel. Not exactly what I was looking forward to this morning. This location gets my order wrong more often than not. I think it's time to find a new breakfast place.

Four out of four people at our table had mistakes made with their food. Some were easy to amend (picking off onions, etc), some were not (burger slathered in undesirable sauce). Remedy took a while and everyone else was finished or nearly so by the time I got my corrected burger. One more umbrella on the outside patio would not go amiss either. Small selection on the menu. I'll give it another shot once they are more established, but not impressed thus far.
