I work just down the street from Biltmore on 32nd, I knew they closed at 6 so I raced over after work and got there about 5:20 (I left a little after 5). I figured 40 minutes would still be good enough time so I walk into the office ready to go see a unit and learn some info and get a shitty look from this blonde girl behind the desk as if she was pissed I just walked in. She tells me that they've stopped showing for the day because it's after dark. Yea I'm sure that's the reason. It wasn't even "dark" yet and it only would have taken 5 minutes to look at a unit. What the eff kind of excuse is that?? I didnt know I needed the sun to be out to be able to see? Or is the community really that unsafe even the office staff don't want to wander around when the "lights go out"? Shitty customer service, I live in Avondale so it's not exactly convenient to drive back up to Phoenix on the weekend. She could have been more accommodating by maybe getting off her lazy butt and showing me a unit instead of using some bullshit excuse that they don't "show after dark". Everywhere I've gone they say as long as you're there by 5:30 you're good. Too bad, they just lost a renter.

I've been here twice and pretty much ordered the same thing, I have to say it was fresh and pretty tasty!  I ordered the Spinach & Bacon Egg Panini (with turkey instead of bacon) and cinnamon bagel bites, the second time I tried the cinnamon bagel poppers (pretty much the same thing the poppers are just in a cup that's cleaner and easier to carry) ... Anyhow the panini was very good! Fresh, hot and a good mixture of ingredients. The only thing really bringing flavor to it though is the roasted tomato spread so if you don't want it tasting too bland ask for extra!   The cinnamon treats were alright. Nothing special, but good if you want a sweet fix! I just wish they were kept warm, they would probably be way better!  I met the general manager the second time around and he was very nice! Actually taking orders for customers, which I always think is awesome of managers, that they help out too and not just bark orders. Also, both times I went around 12:30 and got in and out pretty fast! I only have 30 minutes for lunch and still had time to drive back to work and eat.  I didn't give this place 5 stars because the cinnamon bites we're just ok and random, but they don't put napkins in the to-go bags! I HATE when places do that, or rather DON'T do that! lol anywho...  Overall I'm a fan! Want to check this place out? I say give it a go!

I like this place! Pretty good food (I only had appetizers) and you can't go wrong with the wine! The staff know their stuff, which is great! They are also very accommodating and friendly!  I think we all know the parking sucks, haha. But the only other meh thing for me is that it's very loud inside, I don't have good hearing haha.

OVERPRICED! You can get the same, if not better stuff at Goodwill for half the price!  I get that proceeds go to charity, but damn.  I most likely won't ever go back.

I wasn't going to leave a review at first, but it's been a couple of weeks and I still hate my hair. How on earth it is supposed to be thought of as a good job by the stylist who did it is insane, I should have known by her blah-zay attitude. The front desk's customer service left a little to be desired as well. Super bummed, I miss the cut I had before even though my ends were fried :(

I came here recently for lunch with my Grandma and we were very satisfied!  We both ordered the fish tacos - delish!! A side of the baked (?) asparagus and chips/guac. My grandma raved about the asparagus haha and I enjoyed my guac and salsa. The chips however were SO thin they were hard to scoop with.  Service was great! Quick, too and the weather was perfect for sitting outdoors. The patio was clean and the umbrellas were easy to use.  Overall, we left full and happy. I will definitely be back for more tacos!

Simply put... Dr. Bob is amazing!! I wrote a review (on my page) for the vet I was going to previously and I can tell you the difference was night and day!  My dogs are like my children so I'm always a nervous wreck, but he was so thorough and caring and you can tell he really loves what he's doing so that alone put me at ease. He gave my dog a THOROUGH evaluation, meaning he checked his eyes, ears, etc. something my other vet had failed to do! He explained everything to me and answered any questions I had no matter how ridiculous.  One thing in particular is that my previous vet had failed to recommend anything for my dog's teeth the last time I took him in, but Dr. Bob recommended I get him in right away for a cleaning/extractions because it was obviously severe. He pulled 18 teeth!! I was happy, but so sad because if my previous vet had done his job correctly my dog's teeth wouldn't have gotten so bad. I can't express enough how important it is to find the right vet!  ANYWHO... I am so happy I found All Creatures and will continue to take both of my pupps to him. The staff has also always been polite and helpful. I will recommend them to any and everyone!

I ordered a salad and some wings and it took over an hour for them to arrive. This place is about 5 mins away from me so I think that is ridiculous. The wings were good, but the salad had bacon all over it so I couldn't even eat it. The description didn't say there was bacon and it looked good so I was disappointed. Everything seemed fresh, but I can't get over waiting an hour for a salad I couldn't eat and some wings.

I'm glad I found this place! They ended up being just around the block from my office, which is  perfect. Service is great! Quick turnaround times, too. My first order was completed quickly and accurately and the pricing was very reasonable! We've already placed our second order :)

I came here with my fam last night and our experience was just okay. There was 5 of us and it cost around $75 bucks for all of us to bowl two games. Kind of pricey considering we had a 4 and 6 year old with us. They don't offer any packages either which is kind of lame.  The women's bathrooms were disgusting! Three stalls I didn't dare go in and to top it off there was no soap. Gross.   We also had a group of teenagers next to us that had no bowling etiquette. Obviously, this isn't the bowling alley's fault, but it was super annoying! All 4 of them would stand where you bowl (never in the waiting area), and at least two would go all the way up to the lane each time someone had a turn, and often stand so far over they were blocking our lane. I had to say something twice when my sister could actually not even throw her ball. My 4 and 6 year old nieces behaved better!!  We decided we were only going to bowl one game so we asked if we could have a refund for the other game we paid for and they said they don't give refunds. So they gave us vouchers for free games, but nothing for the shoes. He said to just mention it when we come back and that they'll waive it. That was kind of frustrating because what if we wanted to go to a different location??   I personally wasn't a fan of this location and probably wouldn't return. Too much going on that made it more stressful than enjoyable :/

I haven't really been to any other costume shops so I can't really give them 5 stars with nothing to compare, but nonetheless this place is pretty great!  Like most people have said the parking lot is teeny tiny, but there's a guy that drives around on a golf cart giving you rides if you park on the neighborhood next to them (probably only during Halloween) but I thought that was nice, they don't have to do anything like that, it just shows they go a little above and beyond.  I walked into this place knowing exactly what I wanted to be and exactly what I need to complete my costume and I'm not kidding you when I say that I found EVERYthing that I needed. It was seriously a one stop shop. Awesome!  I needed fake red nails, green face paint, eyelashes, a black ring, a black collar and lipstick and walked out of that place with all of it! They were SUPER busy when I went, JUST before Halloween of course (leave it to a procrastinator) and even though they were running around they did a good job at helping me as much as they could. I was Malificent, btw.   Give them a go if you need something costume related. Don't shop on their website, it's just not the same and really not a good representation of their store!

I placed an order over the phone (a waffle slam), went to pick it up, drove all the way home to find NO syrup in the bag. Of all things! It wouldn't have been an issue if I had syrup at home, but I don't so I was beyond frustrated that I had to drive all the way back to Denny's for syrup.  When I got there I told them I would like an entirely new meal because by that time it was cold and waffles get soggy pretty quickly. They happily obliged. However, when they made my new order there was syrup, but no Pico de Gallo that I asked for.   This is the second time they messed up my order. The first time I ordered a side of potatoes and never got them.  Incompetence at it's best. Trivial things, but really, how hard can it be to work at Denny's? I gave 2 stars because the food overall was good.  Rule of Thumb: ALWAYS check your orders!!

I came here with my Grandma for lunch and I have to say I enjoyed it! They've definitely got a theme going on that's sort of eclectic and charming. We sat outside because the patio is nice with fountains and such and who doesn't want some fresh AZ air while we can get it!? I ordered the Baja Fish Tacos and I was definitely satisfied - they were so good!  They give you chips and salsa when you sit down, which I love! I liked that it wasn't spicy and that they ask you if you want a spicy version. We don't all like spice!  The ONLY caveat to all of this is that our waitress came over to the table a little TOO much. She was very nice, but came over at least 10 times and we were only there for an hour maybe hour and a half. It can get a little bothersome when you're trying to have a conversation.  It's also a little pricey for Mexican food ($13 bucks for two tacos!), but other than that, the place was nice, the food was good - I'll definitely be back!

Seems they've dropped the ball. What a shame because as you can see from my reviews of other locations I really do love RA, but darnit this time around it was no bueno.  I went on a Friday afternoon and it was dead! Which I don't know about you, but when a place is empty during happy hour that makes me nervous! I like the vibe of a full restaurant and people watching doesn't hurt either. haha.   The bartender was weird. Maybe just a little too blah-zay about her job? I don't know but there were only 3 other people sitting at the bar the entire time I was there and it just seemed to be too much for her to handle or maybe she just didn't care.   The sushi, was sushi, I guess. I had a Tootsy Maki and a Shrimp Temura Roll, but they weren't wrapped right, tasted old and frankly it seemed like the chef didn't care about what he was doing either.   I had also ordered a Shiso Naughty mixed drink, now really, how can you possibly get that wrong? She put too much of the x-rated liqueur in it making it taste too acidic and believe me, when this drink is made well, it's good!  Overall the experience and food was a waste of $20 bucks. I much rather have driven back to Glendale and eaten at Kabuki.

I went back again with a friend thinking things might be different.  Uhmmm yea so we got a table towards the back and within 5 minutes or so there was this AWFUL smell that filled the back half of the restaurant - like sewage or rotten fish... I don't know what it was, but we had to move tables because it was so bad. As of now I think I've given them enough chances! I won't be back!

I thought Dr. Montana was a good vet that cares... until recently.  I took my 2 dogs in because they were itching incessantly and had these little scabs and red spots all over. I thought they had mange, but when I got to the vet he told me they didn't have mange and that it was allergies. I thought, why ALL OF A SUDDEN would they BOTH have allergies when we've lived in AZ for 2 years? But I couldn't explain it, I'm not a vet, so I took the recommendation of giving them cortisone shots and went on my way. He said the itching would stop in a couple of hours and when it didn't it had me worried. The shots weren't working so what could it be?? I decided to check them again and upon further 'thorough' inspection I found that they were both COVERED in ticks!! I pulled about 30 off of them!   WHY did the vet not check for ticks?? Why was this not caught?? How could he diagnose them with allergies when he obviously didn't provide a thorough exam?? I was outraged!! Not only did I pay $150 for shots that weren't needed I had to completely tear apart my house a few days later because not only were ticks on the dogs, they were everywhere!! I had a professional pest company come spray and also treated the dogs with Frontline - another $200 bucks!  I called their offices asking for a refund for the shots and was told that they wouldn't do that because the Dr. didn't find any ticks. No shit!! Because he didn't check properly! Gr, I'm so mad!  I also mentioned that one of my dogs teeth were very bad and that he had a strong foul odor coming out of his mouth and he didn't do or recommend anything for him! Since then he has lost a tooth and isn't eating normally. Poor guy!! Come to find out, after my own research, it looks as though he has periodontal disease and needs treatment! I will be taking him to a new vet on Saturday. Hopefully, they will be able to help right away!   These are my babies and I will not tolerate anyone being so careless!! Shame on you!!

I came here around 12:30PM on Friday and it was just bustling!! I was actually surprised to see how busy it was when I walked in because you couldn't tell from the outside. Their demographic seemed to be 90% grandma and grandpas. I ordered my food to-go so I stood by the front door waiting, on my phone of course, and I thought to myself, "they're probably all looking at me like those damn millennials and their phones." Sure enough, grandpa Bob walks by and asks, "anything good on there?" I felt like I was in trouble lol. It was funny.  Anywho.. I ordered a chef salad and have never been so impressed. Albeit it WAS around $11 bucks, it was delish!! Like I mentioned, I ordered it to-go and it was full to the max! I feel you get a little jipped with to-go orders usually, but that wasn't the case here. There was enough for two people really and all of the ingredients were so fresh! It came with turkey, ham (I didn't get this), cucumber, tomato, egg and cheese. I asked for ranch as my dressing and even that was fantastic!   The place was clean and the service was also great. The hostess was very friendly and had a cute little Latin accent. Me gusta!  I am honestly craving that salad! I have more work to get done on my car so I definitely know where I'm having lunch ;)

This place needs some serious work! Honestly blehh!  Being on "top of the world" isn't enough to get me to go back!  First of all, Yes, you are very high up and the view is pretty cool as well as the fact that the floor revolves.... BUT....  It is veryy expensive! Their cheapest entrees were in the 20s, their Caesar Salad was $12 ... for a salad!?! For some people that may not be a lot, but for ME it is! Just because you are up really high in the sky means you have to pay out the ass for food? Me thinks not! ... Personally when I saw my friends meals I was glad I didn't order anything - It didnt look worth the money and my friend ended up not feeling well afterwards.  My friend said "all you're paying for is the experience" .. Well I've been to restaurants at the same price with better service, food and had a better "experience!" If it means not having a view then so be it! Why does the restaurant think the view makes up for all of that?  Anywayss.. The interior is very drab, looks like it's from the 80s, dark colors, they tried brightening the place up with white tablecloths, but that doesn't help when the lighting is so low you can barely see your plate - I feel like theyre trying to hide something. Also, they weren't playing any music, it was kind of awkward so I put a Jazz Pandora station on my phone so we didn't feel so awkward.. At one poing a live band started playing upstairs somewhere, but it was just in one spot  (they dont revolve) so the sound was quiet then loud when you got closer.. just weird.  Overall I was very dissappointed with the "restaurant" when I walked in, it really needs to be renovated! If you want the "experience" go for it, but I honestly don't think it's worth your time or money :(

I had high hopes for this place based on the ambiance and decor of the inside. It was very pretty and had a great feel, I was impressed when I walked in. However, I ordered two California Rolls to-go and I was not impressed food wise. It look good in presentation, but it just wasn't the greatest sushi I've ever had. I wouldn't order it again. I'm willing to give them a second change, try something different on the menu, but as of right now I have experienced better.

I can't believe I waited this long to try them out! Their sushi is in my top 3 of sushi I've had in Arizona for sure. Always fresh and tastes great! I always get my food to go - sometimes I can wait 20-30 minutes, but it's definitely worth it. I just wish they had longer hours!

SCAMMERS!!!! BEWARE!!!!  I bought my sister a bunch of gift cards for her birthday to all of her favorite places and this WAS one of them. She hasn't had ANY problems with any of the other gift cards, but when she went to get her nails done here, they said there was no value on the card!! WHAT!?! That means that THEY never put the $20 I paid onto the card! She NEVER used it or even part of it. I called and had to argue with the guy for a good couple of minutes for them to only honor half of the value. He said when a card is used it resets to 0, but she never used the card so that must mean it was an old card someone else used and that they never actually put my money on it. I will be calling the bank and disputing this! Absolutely ridiculous! It sounds bad, but I'm glad it was my sister rather than someone else I may have gave the card to, how embarrassing!  Lesson learned! We will NEVER go back here!

Great experience today! I am a newbie to the makeup world. In fact, stores like Sephora give me anxiety and usually make me feel completely overwhelmed with all of the options. Hence why my makeup collection is that of a teenage girl. I avoid having to pick out a new shade of foundation like the bubonic plague. Am I M20? R20? C20? P20?! Heck if I know!! My sister has always been ahead of me with the makeup game and is a Rouge member so she came with me today to help me start to revamp my collection.   When we first got there we made a game plan on what we'd start with and what my priorities were. Once we did that we found a gal to do a ColoriQ for me. Her name was Calista and she was SO helpful and friendly! I am basically starting from scratch with my products (and my makeup knowledge apparently lol) so she had her work cut out for her, but she was very patient and informative. She really listened, which I think is so important, and didn't just recommend things because they are expensive or popular. We went over foundations, concealers, primers and skincare products!  We were there for quite a while so it eventually came time for Calista to go to lunch. She passed me over to a gal named Jocelyn, gave her the low down on where we were and what I needed and she jumped right in! She was also so helpful and friendly!  After skincare and makeup we hopped on over to fragrances because I only own $10 knock offs lol. A different gal helped us there and she, too, was so helpful and friendly! My gosh they all were! Haha. It was great.  I was only there to get samples so I could start trying out different products so I was impressed at how attentive they are even if you're not buying anything. It can be weird asking for help, especially for free things, but not once did I feel like I was an inconvenience or a waste of time. And not once did I feel pressured or remotely persuaded into buying anything at all.  Great service! Got some awesome samples to try out! I don't feel like the makeup world is as scary now! 5 stars all around!

J.K. sushi?? Yeah because they are clearly a joke! How is this place still in business?!  California roll, shrimp tempura roll and egg rolls set me back $16 bucks! Worst sushi ever!! Old rice, stale, poorly assembled, not fresh and ugh, just so gross. I'll be amazed if I don't end up sick.   Omg, no... Just no.

WOW! So I always order a breakfast sandwich even when it's not breakfast, I just order it with chicken instead of egg and they're always accommodating in making it for me. Even though I always throw them for a loop with my order haha. Seriously it's so good though they need to add it to the menu.   Also, their customer service is fantastic! I had ordered my special sandwich just yesterday and one for my sister and took it home with me after work so we could eat before we had to leave for an evening conference. Well, when I got home and opened the box it was no where near the sandwich I had ordered - no spinach, no tomatoes and it had ham on it for some reason. We don't eat red meat so I was pretty upset and disappointed. We thought we were left with just pasta salad to eat for dinner. I was so tired I didn't even want to deal with it, but my sister said she would call for me. So she did, and explained what happened and let me tell you, not only did they fix our order and make us new sandwiches, but they delivered them to my house!!! (I'm just down the street lol) We were seriously dumbfounded at the fact that they just offered to do this! We told them that it was okay and that they could just issue me a credit or something, but they insisted on "making it right." Jerry, I believe is who brought us our corrected order and we were so grateful. So amazing, they went ABOVE and beyond!

I was not impressed! For what you pay and what the Yard House is supposed to live up to it was just not there for me. The food was greasy, bland and seriously lacked 'care'. Just slapped on a plate!  This review is from July of 2013 LOL. I never finished it, so who knows. Things may have changed by now.

Unfortunately, I have experienced better.   I ordered the Lobster Ravioli and at $17 bucks for the plate I was expecting something a little more satisfying. For some reason I thought the dish was around $10 bucks, but was shocked to find out it was $17. It did come with soup, which was good, the chicken gnocchi something or other.  My friend's meal was also just okay AND she found a hair in her salad. We weren't going to say anything until I realized that the fork I had been eating with had a hair stuck onto it the entire time. I'm not sure what it was that it was stuck on with, but I was pretty disgusted. We told the waitress finally and the manager came over and asked if we wanted any meals to take home or dessert. I declined and when he came back he had deducted $9 off of our bill. He also gave me another chicken soup to take home. Not sure how I feel about the whole thing really. Bleh.  A random side note is that they have little kiosk stands at each table, those are cool for ordering/paying for your meal, but personally I don't think they should have games and/or whatever entertaining things on them. I saw kids with them right in front of their face when, in my opinion, they should be eating and spending time with who they're with. Not playing video games at the table.

I've been here a couple of times and I enjoy it. It's trendy and hip and I think the food and drinks are great! The atmosphere is perfect for grabbing a bite/drink with friends. It's got an upbeat vibe and you'll see people from all age groups here. They also accommodate large groups, which is great! It's loud inside though so this isn't really the best place for large groups if you want to be able to talk. haha. Parking is usually packed so they offer complimentary VIP.  My only issue is that each time I've dined with them they are late on my reservation. Also, I went for my birthday dinner last weekend and our waitress was a bit snooty the whole time, but whatever.  Definitely give them a go! :)

Yummy Yumm Yumm!  Short and sweet this place has some good Pho! It tastes great, the chicken is amazeballs because it's actually REAL chicken! The price is fair, about $7.50 for a large, the side sauces are separated and not pre-mixed together (I hate when places do that) and it's always fresh! Oh the service is fast too! I've always ordered to go, but it's quick and I like that I'm in and out in no time!  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they have a bell on the door so each time someone walks in OR out the bell goes *ding ding dong dong - dong dong ding ding* ... if I was dining in I would probably have to rip it off! lol  Anywho if you're around and want some good Pho check them out! That's all I've ever order so that's all I'm reviewing, just fyi ;)

Yum Yum Yum!! Check it out now, funk show brotha... ok I'll stop.  This place is G - double O - D. Good!  I LOVE their strawberry smoothie (I prefer it over Jamba) and love the Mediterranean Egg White Sandwich (breakfast) and the Tomato Mozzarella is pretty good too. I haven't tried much, but it all has been good so far. A little pricey but it's healthier than most places so I don't mind.  The only thing I don't like is that it's confusing! Their organization is weird! Where you order, what you order where, I've been sent to different counters for different things, different registers, etc. and I'm pretty "with it" if you know what I mean and even I get confused when I walk in! lol. I also don't like that I can never find a trashcan! Random I know, but I've been there multiple times and I still can't find it! lol annoying, but ah well.  I like this place and I will continue to go there as long as they're around. I've been to the location in Goodyear also and the food was good there too! If you're around go check them out!

GROSS!! I 'literally' just had this place for lunch about 10 minutes ago and seriously, their food is pretty nasty.  I had the "California Roll", I put it in quotes because they're clearly store bought and NOT homemade and tasted appropriately so. The order came with four rolls, I regretfully ate one and threw the rest away.  I also had a Chicken Yakisoba, smallest portion I've ever seen for an 'asian food' place and it cost $5 bucks and some change at that. The broccoli was not steamed, pretty much raw and the whole thing just tasted burnt! and greasy!   Absolutely not worth it. Disgusting! Just go somewhere else. BLEH!

We began our adventure at 6:00am on Saturday morning. Parking is $7 and finding the trail head was very easy.  As we passed by the Welcome gate we were in awe of beautiful lush mountains and scenery that looked quite jungle like. I said to my friends, "Wow - wouldn't it be amazing if we get to that canyon and it's like a different world! With monkey's jumping around and herbivorous pterodactyl's soaring through the air, colorful exotic birds and flowers that fill the air with a beautiful sweet scent as you ascend the mountain!?" Well, they thought I was crazy and my imagination definitely didn't come to fruition - there were no exotic creatures or wildlife, BUT there was moss and plenty of Gnats! Making my first recommendation: bug spray! We were covered in gnats the entire trip so save yourself 5-6 hours of aggravation and get some.   Immediately after starting we were at a consistent incline. It was then that I could tell this wasn't going to be an easy feat, especially when you look AT Flat Iron and see just how far you have to go! 4,800 feet... Straight up! Yikes! Alas, we dug deep and just took it one step at a time. We got off trail a time or two - following the white dots isn't as easy as it seems because they blend in. "I see a white dot! Oh, wait, no... that's bird poop." My best advice would be that it seemed you ought to stay to the left most times it looks like the trail splits, but that's just me. Be careful!   Of course, bring water. And plenty of it! I'm 5'1", 120lbs and went through 68 ounces like it was nothing! Also, bring some wet wipes (and Ziploc baggies for the trash) if you need to do your business.  My second recommendation: take gloves! I can't stress this enough. I used some old gardening gloves I had that had a little bit of grip and they worked great. We were basically mountain goats the majority of this hike so I don't know how I would have managed without. Especially, when it came to the dreaded "10 foot wall," which is actually not daunting at all and upon arrival had us all on an anticlimactic revelation as we realized the wall of terror we heard so much about was not a big feat, but in actuality had us all cawing "that's it?!?" Lame.  Albeit the hike wasn't the Avatar inspired vision I had it was still gorgeous! The views throughout are awesome and climbing rocks is really fun! The view(s) at the top are even more breathtaking! There's no bar, which was disappointing, but it looks like a landscaped garden and has trees that look like something out of the Lorax. You know no one is hiking up there to trim bushes so it's awesome seeing how pretty "untouched" nature is!  Some other little tips from my experience: 1. Clip your toenails short so your toes don't get sore when going downhill. You can even buy toe pads that ballerina's use for extra cushion. 2. Don't wear cotton, especially socks. I got a major blister on the ball of my right foot. 3. Eat breakfast and bring snacks for energy. When we first started I kept whining, "I don't wanna!", but I had a Power Bar and 30 minutes later I was PUMPED! 4. Watch out for critters! On our way up a girl asked us if we saw a rattlesnake that apparently was just hanging out near the trail. No thanks! 5. Zig-zagging downhill helps tremendously instead of trying to go straight down slippery rock. 6. Carb load the night before and get plenty of protein after for recovery. 7. Don't attempt this hike if you've never hiked before or are out of shape. Seriously.  As mentioned before, we started this hike at 6am. Praise Jesus we were able to hike up the entire mountain in the shade, however, our descent wasn't so enjoyable. By that time (10am or so) the sun was beating down and it was pretty draining. I lathered up with some much needed sunscreen and had to sing my complaints out loud to keep myself from going crazy at how monotonous it was. If I were to do this hike again I would probably start at 5am. On our way down there was a guy in rough shape. He kept saying he didn't think he was going to make it. He was throwing up, crying, snot running down his nose - so be careful! Heat exhaustion and dehydration are NO joke. If you can't do Camelback or Piestewa with ease, you can't do this either.  Overall, this hike took us 6 hours round trip from the parking lot, and covered around 7 miles. I do intermediate yoga at least twice a week and go to the gym so I would consider myself in decent shape; this mountain will kick your butt, but you will survive! Although, I have to admit, some extra inches would have come in handy. I got to a couple of big boulders and thought, "how in the hell are these little legs going to get up THAT!?" But I made like a monkey and made do! I for sure thought I was going to be in pain the day after, but in some magical way I wasn't sore AT ALL. How that's even possible? I honestly have no idea. Just get out there and do it! Flat Iron in all of its glory is waiting for you!

This office is horrible. EVERY time I've gone to this Fed Ex I have been dissatisfied upon walking out. I'm an optimistic person, I tend to always think that if I go back to a place things might be different. WRONG! Like Einstein said, "insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."   First things first, the staff are SO pushy! As soon as I walked in they bombarded me with questions and basically asked me if I knew what I was doing. A simple greeting would suffice, geezus! If I needed as much assistance as they apparently think I do don't ya think I'd ask??   Second, SO they bombard you with questions and/or try and make you out to be some dumba** who can't figure out how to ship something right, but then when I DO have a simple question or two they have no answer! Seriously what twilight zone did I just walk into?? Get it together!  Point blank their customer service skills suck! I went to the Fed Ex off McDowell and 99th and I can't tell you what a difference there was! I will continue to go there even though its 5-10 minutes farther from me.

I had never had alterations before so I wasn't sure what to expect, but this place was awesome! I took them the dress I needed altered just 2 days before New Years and it only cost $10 extra for fast turnaround! Everyone there was super nice as well!  They took my dress in at the waist for me and it couldn't have fit better!  I gave 4/5 stars due to the fact that I've only had one thing altered by them, but I will definitely go back though if the need arises!

Hey, this place is pretty cool! The only other aquarium I've been to is the Aquarium of the Pacific (with which I was NOT impressed), but this one seemed to be pretty neat! The sea life all seemed to be very lively, lol that may sound weird, but at the AOP they all seemed to be kind of bored. The only things we could touch though were the starfish, bummer, because I really wanted to pet a sting ray again.  Anyhow! The flow of this place is nice, the paths continue on and you don't have to jump around from exhibit to exhibit like at the AOP. It's dark, another benefit of really being able to see all of the sea life well, but that also proposes the problem of loosing track of the kiddos! At least twice we were looking around for my niece who likes to bolt off when she see's something cool, leaving us scrounging around in the dark trying to find her in a sea of people! haha ;)  There are cool little dome view areas for the kids to crawl into (and some adults apparently) lol. There's also a play area for the kids at the end and seating (including some couches) for the parents and of course, a gift shop.  We went on a Saturday so just be warned, there are a lot of people! Even the mall was packed!! We also had a baby with us, so if you can manage to not take a stroller I would recommend that, we had one and being that there were so many people it would have been a lot easier to just strap the baby to our back (or front).  Adult admission was $18 I believe and kids are $12 so try to find some coupons, but if you're around, definitely give this place a shot regardless of price! It's short and sweet, but hey! Who doesn't love checking out "animals"? This would also be a fun place for a date! ;)

We had our staff holiday party here and I would say the service was just okay. Food wasn't great and most of it was spicy (yuck), waitresses were MIA, bowling ball weights were limited, one of our lanes kept glitching. Really, just too many things to get into, but they left a LOT to be desired! Personally, I don't think I would go back :/

I've only eaten here once, but I loved it. It was fresh and so tasty and I didn't feel guilty after eating a pasta dish! That's a win in my book :)  Great decor and atmosphere and our waitress was very nice and new her stuff!

Not impressed! Not only was the wait staff rude, but my food was not good. I ordered the turkey burger on a gluten free bun, which came with a kale side salad. And all I have to say is yuck! The burger was very dry, lacking flavor, and the salad... bleh!!  There were about 8 of us there for my coworkers birthday so rather than raise a stink I wrote on my receipt "very dry burger!", but the waitress didn't do anything to resolve the fact that a customer was obviously left dissatisfied. Two thumbs down. Definitely not worth $15 bucks!!

Since my previous review the manager has reached out to me to discuss the experience I had. He was very understanding and you can definitely tell he cares, about his restaurant and his patrons. I am happy to update my review and I will definitely be giving them another try. Kudos!

Wow!! This club is pretty awesome!  Located inside the Cosmopolitan on the Vegas Strip this club has it all!  The set up is similar to Kress in Hollywood, 3 stories, with a rooftop area only the club is better and bigger! But it's Vegas so of course it is!  To start, get there EARLY, we got there around 830/9 and the line was already long! If you can tryy to get on the guestlist to get guys discounted ($45 from $60) Sheesh! I know! .. I don't know how much they normally charge girls because we were on the GL.. Very important though! The ratio of girls/guys needs to be EVEN! They will not let any guys in without an equal amount of girls! It's just how they roll! lol (Honestly, I prefer even ratio, it's way better than a bunch of one sex runnin around)   TIP: Go at 8/830, get your stamp, go back to your room, drink, pregame, w.e and then come back around 11.  The security is insane and the line has all these different areas for different things (VIP, GL, Bottle service, etc.) BUT they are very organized and OMG the bouncers and elevator guys and stair people are sooo nice! I was in shock! They were even goofing around and would conversate with you instead of just give you looks... at one point the elevator guys were competing on who had the most girls! lol...  So the club interior is off the chizzain! It's ultra fresh and the outdoor patio! OMGGG! lmao I'm getting excited talking about it... There was lights, wind (natural, which I liked cause it made it feel tropical), jacuzzis, pools, bars, cabanas! Shit you name it they got it! The outside are is more for lounging, chatting, drinking, as there is no dancefloor, but it's an awesome area to chill out and relax!  The dancefloors were packkedd! They only had two that I saw, not too big, but decent, find a spot and dance your little heart out - they had one techno room and one hip-hop (I was in hip-hop) .. The music was great, I danced for hours straight! :)  You know Vegas, so I wont talk about parking, if you're there take a cab, etc. I stayed at Vdara which is next door so we just walked over. Very convenient!  The only thing is when you leave it's a bitch to get out and you have to go back that way if you leave and return, not through the main entrance.. its pretty confusing and kind of a long walk, not gonna lie! So ladies bring some fast flats! :)  Overall you really should check this club out! When I go back to Vegas I will be going back! ;)

Great place! My co-worker and I love trying out new spots and often use our lunch hour to do just that. She had asked me what I was in the mood for and I said, "something good!" haha. Luckily, this place hit the nail on the head!  I had the Shrimp Killer Roll and a California Roll and they were both great! My tell tale sign of good sushi is if a place can make a GOOD California Roll because it's so simple... that they did! My friend had Ramen and enjoyed her meal as well.  I had never heard of Mochi Ice Cream before, we asked what it was and the gentleman pleasantly explained it to us, I wasn't exactly sure what he was describing, but we bit the bullet and ordered a strawberry to share. It was delish! Perfectly light dessert to compliment a light sushi meal.  The staff are nice. The place was clean. Plenty of parking. Outdoor seating on the patio as well as indoor seating (not sure why someone said this isn't a place at which to dine??). It's no Mastro's, but it's quaint and has charm. Overall, we had a positive experience and will definitely be back! I've added them to my top three for sushi ;)

Ok so I have been here before and the experience wasn't that bad, that's why I went back - well that was a mistake! P.S. My review will be similar to the one for Hi Fi because, well, they both sucked the same!   I went last Saturday night and this place was like a sardine can!! SUPER wayy too packed! There was NO room for dancing, or even just mingling. Frankly, you couldn't even breathe!! Brushing elbows? More like brushing noses! It was miserable and as soon as I felt my claustrophobia kicking in I needed to escape! We were about to leave when this guy started talking to me, lucky for me he did because we found a small 2 feet by 2 feet area we could a least attempt to dance in as they started to play some awesome salsa jams. Best 5 minutes of music we had heard all night so we bounced our little hearts out, all of the white guys in complete shock at seeing these two little Latin fire crackers break it down lol, annnnd then we left.   Seriously though, who wants to "party" like that?? I want to be able to mingle, get a drink fairly quick, DANCE and I don't know have room to breathe and chill out. I know places may be popular and "thee place to be", but it would seem way more exclusive and maybe even worth paying entry if the atmosphere was right.  Like really EL HEFE they have "maximum occupancy" laws for a reason! I could not imagine what would happen if a fire broke out! This place is not only NOT fun, but also NOT safe!   I don't see myself ever going back on a Sat night. The ONLY reason I gave them 2 stars and not 1 is because my friend and I didn't have to wait in their long ass line. We walked up to the front and they just let us in lol.

Not the best sushi I've ever had, but it's the best sushi I've had within at leastt a 10 mile radius of PV Mall (I live next door). It's fresh and has tasted good every time I've ordered it (more than 5 times by now). I've also had their chow mein, it's good and so are their spring rolls!   I've also ordered delivery and they are pretty fast! Granted I'm only 5/10 minutes away, but hey. They fudged up and gave me veggie fried rice once instead of the chow mein I had ordered, but fixed it promptly and redelivered the right order. The rice was good too, lol!  On a side note you get good discounts on sushi if you order online and go pick it up, which I will do as I'm leaving work so I can stop and go on my way home. They always give me a free drink too. I believe if you call and place an order you also get a good discount, I think it was like 40%, but that could have been a promo thing.  I recommend! Give them a try :)

So I've had and yet to have extensive work done at Bright Now. So far I've had 4 or 5 cavities filled, an onlay and a deep cleaning. I hadn't been to the dentist in yearsss so I was behind haha, plus I have 'soft' teeth. I've also yet to have 2 more cavities taken care of, 5 teeth pulled and braces!! So my journey with them is not even close to over, but I'm glad I found them!  This is probably the best dental experience I've ever had. In the past for some reason all of the offices I went to were just cold and distant in their demeanor. That is not the case with this office! All of the staff are very friendly, warm and comforting. Everyone generally seems to be in a good mood and they really know their stuff or will help you find out. Side note: there is one blonde girl that works the front desk that isn't super personable, but whatever.  My doctor (Dr. LaGrone) is the most spunky and upbeat person ever! Haha. She's always willing to answer your questions, tells you exactly what she's going to do and has great 'bed side' manners. She's also amazing with a needle! I hate the numbing part the most, but she does it smoothly and uses a cheek shaking technique to minimize the pain lol. It's a little sore the day after sometimes, but I rather not feel pain in the chair!  On a side note, I've never had to wait long at all to be taken to a room or for the dentist. They're quick, efficient and if you listen to the team they communicate well together. They have also been very good at working with me on my appointments since I always need late afternoons.  Overall my experience has been positive and I recommend you check them out! If you have a bad run-in with the front desk staff, don't let that get in the way of the best dentist you may have ever had! Just sayin ;)  p.s. I'll continue to review if anything changes since I'll most likely be going to them for the next 2 years! lol.

I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THE CAMELBACK LOCATION!!!  Which is a total bummer because I absolutely loved my dentist, but the office staff are completely and inherently incompetent.  They were great for a couple of weeks, but EVERY time I have needed something they literally have always said, "I don't know" and whoever I talk to will revert me to someone else who "doesn't know" or say they will take a message and call me back, but they NEVER do. I have left over 5 messages regarding different things and never, not once received a call back.  I called today to get a wisdom tooth extraction scheduled and am told that there is currently no one in the office that can help me. WWW TTT FFFF!?!?!  Oh, and they will also proceed to send you collection letters for a bill that you supposedly never paid, but never, not ONCE mentioned or sent an ACTUAL bill first. I was outraged!! The first I ever heard of owing anything was a collection letter and I had just visited their office and they didn't mention it. Sounds fishy to me!! Best part about it... they couldn't even tell me why I owed that money!!! After every appointment I had paid over $100 (varying amounts) for my services, but all of a sudden I owe more money and they can't tell me why? That doesn't seem right. I called them about this and they said it was a "computer error" and then shortly after I received an actual bill in the mail. I paid it (still not even knowing why I owe anything) and it still hasn't hit my account. I called about this issue and guess what, they took a message and I still haven't heard anything.  I have dropped over $1500 in services with them, still have more work to do (including braces) and this is how I am treated???  ABSOLUTELY AND UTTERLY RIDICULOUS!!! GET-IT-TOGETHERRRRR!!! I WILL NEVER GO BACKKK!!! PLEASE AVOID THE HEADACHE!!!

There's a Firestone 2 minutes from my house, but I decided to trek the 20 minutes to this location because they are the only ones that can get my wheel locks off. I was never given the key so it makes it terribly inconvenient at times.  Anywho, I took my car in to get an oil change, have my tires and brakes checked and to get a general vehicle inspection. Once they did the inspection he came back with recommendations, one of them being my engine's air filter. Rather than just tell me it needed to be changed he had it with him to show me, which I liked, you just never know and he was definitely being honest about it. It was dirty! I could tell that my tires were bad, but apparently my brakes were left at 1-2mm (which I was told is not good). They have never been checked or serviced for the 8+ years I've had the car though, (I know, I know) so it wasn't that big of a shock to me. The guy who helped me was very thorough and explained everything to me in detail that I needed and what it would cost, etc. and the dangers or problems I could have if I didn't get it done.  It was going to cost upwards of $1100 bucks for everything so I told him I wanted to sleep on it to decide what I was going to do. He didn't pressure me at all, but just informed me that I should take care of it as soon as possible so that I'm not driving an unsafe vehicle. He printed everything out for me that they were recommending as well as pricing so I could go over it.   I decided that evening that I would go back in the next day or two to have the tires and brakes done. When I got there to drop my car off it was a quick and easy process and there were no sudden changes or surprises. Everything was taken care of and they didn't try to recommend anything else or up sell me. They did call me about my tire sensors because they are broken, but that's understandable.  Once I got back to pick up my car it was, again, quick and easy. Everything went great and I haven't had any problems with my car. In fact, it is now easier to drive and a more smooth ride. I'm especially not fighting steering anymore because they fixed my alignment, too.  The entire process was pleasant and service was great! I would definitely go back to this location.

I mean honestly... The Yard... you've stolen my heart. I seriously LOVE this place. How can you not?! Complimentary valet, live music, food, drinks, free photo booth, ping pong, giant jenga, foosball, corn hole, picnic tables, fire pits, dining areas both in and outdoors, a resident kitty that roams around, YOGAAAA!!! WHAAATTTT!!!   I mean honestly I can't say enough about this place. Omg. I just CAN'T!! It's the only place in existence (or at least that I know of) that literally screams "cater to the customers"! Whoever owns this place seriously knows what he's doing - remarkable! They have thought of EVERYthing and no matter how many times you go your experience is always different, which I personally enjoy. Sometimes service can get a little shaky, but with the mass amounts of people that are always there and the constant movement I don't hold it against them, they do pretty darn good!  I recently went for a morning "bend and brew" yoga sesh. We got a free pint after yoga - amaze balls! We also decided to stay for breakfast - I had the breakfast burrito and it was to die for. I've been craving it ever since!  The ONLY two things I don't necessarily care for is that there's no pool table (hello!) and the bathrooms, mainly because I've often been "checking" myself in the mirror and guys walk by muttering comments like "you look great," "you look fine" or something of the sort and that's kinddd of annoying. Like mind ya business stranger! Psh.  Anyway, if you haven't been I highly suggest you check it out!

Alas a tan I enjoy again! I had a blunder the time before looking quite orange, but the salon reached out to me in an effort to fix the situation. They recommended I do a rapid tan instead of the regular kind and it turned out great! I was tan, but not orange. That will be the way to go for me in the future! I'm glad they helped me figure out what would work best for me. Definitely check them out!

I can't lie, my roommate wanted to go here and I was a bit skeptical. Sushi aka FISH rotating around a conveyor belt at room temperature for god knows how long!? How can that be good!?   Ahhh, but it WAS!  It took me a second to grasp my head around the concept, but once I did and was able to jump into the rotating saucers of flying sushi I was pleasantly surprised. I had a California Roll and (I think) a Shrimp Tempura Roll and they were both yummy! I've actually had worse sushi from nicer restaurants.  My roommate tried something different and was satisfied with 3 out of the 4 plates she grabbed. She didn't touch but once piece of the last plate and when she mentioned that she didn't like it the lady helping us removed it and she didn't have to pay for it. I thought that was nice.  Our experience was a pleasant one. I would definitely go back to get my sushi fix :)

Meh. I HAVE experienced better. Sushi is definitely not, just, sushi. I've come to learn that over time. I had high hopes for this place, but the sushi was just 'okay'.  I ordered a Cali roll (my fav) , a Shrimp Tempura Roll and the Vegetable Mini Rolls. All of that set me back $17 and some change!  The Cali roll wasn't cold enough and they skimped a little on the cucumber, also every bite seemed to taste different. It was weird. The Shrimp Roll wasn't anything special and same thing with a few of the bites tasting different. The veggie rolls were pretty good, but I have a feeling they weren't 'homemade'.   Overall the food just left me a little unsatisfied and a tad bleh by my last bite. Such a bummer because I really liked the vibe of this place.  Ah well, like I always say you can try out whatever you want, but I guarantee there's better sushi joints around. I may be back at some point to try out some other menu items (which I'll review), but I probably won't order sushi again.

So the food was pretty good! I had the fish tacos and enjoyed them. My friend liked her meal, too. Which is a bummer because...  The service, was weird! Our waitress was super pushy and asked me if I was ready to order a drink like 4 times in a matter of 10/15 minutes. I told her sorry, that I've been talking (catching up with a friend) and haven't had a chance to look yet and she pointed out that I basically might want to stop talking and look because they were closing in an hour. Rude!  At the end when our check came I asked her if we could get separate checks and she said they can't do that, but that we could split it. So I wrote down the dollar amount (to the penny) that each of us were going to pay. Both amounts ended in something like .16 cents and .18 cents. I explained who was paying what and she tells us that she can't do cents either and instead has to round it to the nearest five or something...?!? WTF? So she said it would be rounded up to .20 cents instead. So you can't charge me .18, but you can charge me .20??? I've never in my life heard of such a thing!!! I don't even care about the extra cents, its the principal of the matter. And as a business if you're having technical difficulties (or whatever) you shouldn't charge the customer the extra cents, no matter how little, it's not my problem! The proper thing to do would be to take a hit and round it down (if anything) and get your crap together! Ugh, the whole thing was frustrating. Plus, she was so rude about it!  Listen up: If they charged 200 people a day for a month an extra .05 cents because of this "issue" or "incapability" they would take home an extra $300 a month!! Something seems super fishy here. Just sayin.  Anyways, I'd say give them a go because the food was good, but if service is shotty or weird things happen don't say I didn't warn you :/

Seriously?? -__-     ....... I'm sorry, but HELL NO! This place SUCKS!  I've only gone once, last Saturday night so you don't necessarily have to value my opinion, but whatever lol. My friend and I are semi new to AZ and were bouncing around Scottsdale, we asked the little golf cart driver guy for a fun place to check out and he recommended Hi Fi... weaaaahhhhhhhhh! WRONG!  We got there and this place was like a sardine can!! SUPER wayy too packed! There was NO room for dancing, or even just mingling. Frankly, you couldn't even breathe!! Brushing elbows? More like brushing noses! It was miserable and as soon as I felt my claustrophobia kicking in I needed to escape! We found a small patch of dry unsticky floor next to the VIP booths to stand on, it was elevated and probably 8 inches wide, but we stood there for a minute to catch our bearings and not get shoved around (we're only 5'1" lol we almost drowned!) Oh and order a drink to relax? Faget about itt! It would have taken hours!  El Hefe was exactly the same! (which I'm about to review next), but who wants to "party" like that?? I want to be able to mingle, get a drink fairly quick, DANCE and I don't know have room to breathe and chill out. I know places may be popular and "thee place to be", but it would seem way more exclusive and maybe even worth paying entry if the atmosphere was right.  Like really Hi Fi they have "maximum occupancy" laws for a reason! I could not imagine what would happen if a fire broke out! This place is not only NOT fun, but also NOT safe!   I don't see myself ever going back on a Sat night, I don't know if it's different on other nights, but I digress, the ONLY reason I gave them 2 stars and not 1 is because my friend and I didn't have to wait in their long ass line. We walked up to the front and they just let us in lol.

I came here around 8:45 on a Saturday night with some girl friends and I liked it!  I, unfortunately, have stomach problems and whereas most people would say I'm "picky", I really just have restrictions. I didn't realize until I got there that Evo was an Italian restaurant and that most of the menu wouldn't work for me. However, once I made this known, our server was more than helpful in dissecting a few dishes that could work for me. I appreciated that rather than getting the sighs and eye-rolls I'm now accustom to.  I chose to go with a side of risotto and a side of fries. They were large portions so it was quite enough to fill me up. Both tasted great, a 'tad' too garlic-y, but at that point, who's complainin!?  We also checked in on our Yelp apps while we were there and got penny fireball shots! Perfect since we were going out after, haha.  I liked the ambiance of the place and the decor. I would definitely dine there again or stop by for a pre turn-up drink ;)

I went back over the weekend with a few girl friends and I just have to say I am (once again) thoroughly impressed! It was pretty busy on Saturday (they let us know they were running 30 minutes behind), but the staff are so friendly and accommodating it's amazing! They have fun with the patrons and also each other while maintaining professionalism and urgency when the hustle and bustle was on and poppin!! Haha. We had a great time with the staff, Dominick (sp?) in particular was a riot! Everyone enjoyed their meals, myself included. Love the penny check-in shots they offer via Yelp! Definitely a fan!

Service WAS "Fast" because no one was there and now it makes me wonder why. The doctor did absolutely nothing for me, but prescribe me antibiotics. I won't go in to detail on why I was there, but that was not the appropriate treatment for what soon happened after the fact.  Also, they said I had a $50 copay, so I paid it and received a bill a month later for more money. Apparently, it was a "miscommunication", but if I ask what the visit is going to cost they should tell me the entire amount (even if that means they have to call) OR advise that I call my insurance. I was under the impression that what they were telling me was accurate so it sucked getting a surprise bill after the fact.  Owell. Lesson learned.

I LOVE THIS PLACE!  We came for "Yoga in the Rainforest" so we got to walk around the exhibit beforehand and I'm so glad we went! It was amazing!  Being from Cali I LOVE a tropical climate so immediately upon walking in it was a breath of fresh, humid air! haha. (not unbearable by any means though if you're not a fan of humidity)  All of the flutterby's were dancing delicately through the air, drinking from flowers or binging on fruit bowls. So pretty! Everywhere you looked there was something new to see - I was truly like a kid in a candy store. Who knew I like butterfly's so much!? haha. One also landed on me, which was slightly creepy because I could feel his little feet, but so cool! :p  In reality you could walk around the entire exhibit in a minute or two, so I wish it was bigger and made you truly feel like you're in a rain forest, but there's so much going on you can actually go around several times to take it all in.  I will definitely be back!   *If your kids are crazy or don't listen, etc. I would say it's a no-go. Butterfly's are delicate and they're extremely accessible here.*

Hmmm I'm not sure I dig this place. I mean the Pho is ok if you want it to go (they don't separate the hot & sweet sauce though, which I didn't care for as I don't eat spicy, but love the sweet), but dining in was something else. We stopped in and found a clean table in the corner among all of the dirty, yet to be cleaned tables. All we wanted was Pho and when we went to order it we were told they were out. What?? You're OUT of Pho? How is that even possible. We got up and left, but right as we were about to get into our car the waitress comes running after us saying they do have Pho now and that we can come back... uhh? Ok whatever, we were seriously hungry and I was seriously hungover and needed food ASAP so we went back in. It was good I guess, typical Pho, the chicken was dry and eyuk though. The service overall was just weird, this place is under new management, but I'm not so sure they have experience in the restaurant business? They just seemed kind of lost and disorganized and the place was dirty. They didn't clean tables until people walked in, my sister carries Clorox wipes everywhere because of her babies and when she wiped our table down it was still pretty dirty even though it was "clean". They also had all of their dirty dishes just piled on the floor towards the back, I thought that was pretty disgusting. Oh and the large bowl of Pho was $9.75!! I thought that was a bit steep and they didn't tell us there would be a price difference when I ordered the large, say vs a regular, it doesn't say anything on the menu either so I thought that was sneaky.  Maybe they're just new or maybe that just won't matter, I don't know, but I definitely think there are better Pho places. There's one pretty close on Van Buren and Dysart that is my fav and their chicken is great! It's actually real and not this fake stuff most places use. I most likely won't go back to PT, but if you want to try them go for it, the choice is yours!

I've only been here once and I was pleased. For me... it wasn't anything extraordinary. I like the vibe/decor. I'm always a fan of open and airy. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. My food was good, but since their specialty IS burgers I expected a little bit more of a "wow" factor.   Alas, I would definitely go back!

I came here on my lunch to get a quick manicure. There was no one in this place except 4 little girls who had 3 ladies working on their nails. I asked how long the wait would be and they said 10 minutes. I walked in at 12:45 and walked out at 1:10 with no manicure. Ridiculous! I went across the street to Scottsdale Nails and they took me right away!

I dined here once before and I wasn't too impressed, granted I don't eat red meat so it's not exactly fair for me to be reviewing a burger joint, right? So rather than writing a review on the turkey burger I once had I decided to forgo it, BUT my coworkers and I just went back recently and have to say I thoroughly enjoyed my meal!   I ordered the Blanco Burger with turkey and the spicy ass Chipotle sauce on the side (thank heavens) and it was VERY good! Turkey burgers are often lackluster and dry, not getting much attention I feel, but I was impressed and would definitely return for it. Yum yum yum! AND it was on a potato bun! Goodness gracious I love potatoes so when the waiter told me it was a potato bun I was sold!  I also must say that the open, airy feel of their restaurant is great and the patio is nice as well. I actually like that it's separated from the restaurant.  Two thumbs up, Zin! Two thumbs up.

I love this place! Punch cards, 15% off during your birthday month, original finds, good quality stuff, name brands for cheap....? SOLD! I always find something here that I like and the gals that work there are all so nice and helpful! It's refreshing walking into a retail store and not having to deal with snooty girls. lol. I'll definitely be back :)

I love this spot - it's a hidden gem! I always describe it to people as an upscale hole-in-the-wall bar for a younger crowd. The atmosphere/decor is trendy and romantic. Love the jenga they put on the tables. Trivia Tuesday's are fun! Service is always friendly and quick. Bathrooms are always clean.   I love that during the week it's low-key, sometimes it's nice to grab a drink midweek without all of the commotion and noise. I have noticed a different vibe on different days of the week, but that's pretty normal - just have to find your groove.  I have yet to try the other side of the bar with the ski ball and such, nor their food, so that will definitely be on my list for next time.  Love Love Love!

I just went here with friends for Memorial Day weekend and albeit it WAS a Sunday the place was totally dead! Our group made up half of the people there.  The bartenders were moody and there were NO staff walking around to service anyone. The GM (or one of them) was busy playing beer pong. We had to ask to get in on a game. Unprofessional given your guests should be the priority.  This place seems like some guys long lost fantasy to own a bar. They named it the Cabin, threw up some logs and camo and it's supposed to be charming and rustic? Me thinks not!   This location used to be the Sandbar and when they were around it was always so busy and fun! Given that there isn't much on the west side I feel bad for the folks over there losing a place like Sandbar. Such a shame.  I would have to say the only plus about this place was the updated patio (no sand, no pool).

I love this studio, the staff, the vibe, the decor! NAMASTE!  A friend and I found out about them because they hosted Bend & Brew at The Yard in Phoenix. After each class, they gave us a free class for their studio. Awesome!  I've recently gotten into yoga and have learned that I'm not into meditating or chanting or any of the "feely" stuff. I really just like seeing what my body is capable of and getting a good workout. That's what I like about Ironwood. They are so chill! The energy and vibe is very positive, but their style is modern and current. They laugh, aren't super serious and encourage you to try things you're not familiar with.   Also, I have found a lot of places have "Intermediate" or "Level 2" classes, but never really felt I learned anything new or challenging, in other words they really didn't differ from a beginner class. Not the case with Ironwood! Their Level 2 was truly a step up and I love it!   Definitely check them out! 5 stars all around! :)

OMG! I LOVEEE this place! Mariscos Acapulco I'm sold!  Not only were the staff ridiculously nice and friendly. The food was BOMB.COM.  I am Latina, so hence look Latina, but I don't speak Espanol. I know I know, blame my mom for not letting my dad teach me! Anywhooo, this always happens, they started speaking to me in Spanish, I try to follow as best I can, but I just wasn't getting it, so at the observation of the confused look on my face the gal asked me if I speak Spanish, I shook my head no and instead of following in the manner of many other not so nice responses I've gotten, she said OK and proceeded to describe what I was asking about in English, even a gentleman behind her sort of helped out. I thought that was very nice as often people will make a mockery of me or make me feel weird for not speaking Spanish, but they surely didn't...  Sooo once I placed my order for the Shrimp Ceviche Tostadas (to-go) I was greeted by a friendly Senor who mumbled something to me in Spanish, I once again said, no habla Espanol and only then did I realize that English was clearly NOT his first language. He was SO NICE and instead of walking away and not even bothering, he started speaking to me in English, he took his time to gather the words and slowly get out what he was trying to say. I was definitely listening. He offered me a free bottle of water while I waited, he thanked me for coming, he told me that he was happy I am there, etc. I was so baffled at this guy! He GENUINELY cares about his restaurant AND the people that go there. He also offered me a Margarita, but since I was on my lunch break (darn! haha) I settled for a Sangria Senorial (don't worry, it's non-alcoholic, sort of like grape juice or something). Normally I don't like taking hand outs, honestly, it makes me feel awkward, but I could tell that me accepting his offer genuinely made him happy.  So NOT ONLY were the people a dream the food was SOOO GOOD! Ahhhh. BOMB ceviche, probably the best I've ever had north of the border. Straight up! I like how it was packaged, the portion was generous and the price was definitely reasonable. It only ran about $8 bucks for two of them! I NEVER and I mean NEVER tip on to-go orders, but this time I was so impressed, I absolutely did!  GO CHECK THEM OUT! DO IT! NOWWW! LOL.  P.S. I guess on Fri/Sat/Sun nights they have karaoke too! LOL. He basically said something along the lines of you can bring your significant other and sing love songs or whatever you like. Hahaha. Does a blow up doll boyfriend count? lol.

Uh... yummmm!  I noticed this location was here a few weeks ago and had no idea it opened! I was immediately excited because I've always been a fan of First Watch.  I finally visited this week and immediately upon walking in I was greeted by two friendly staff members. I originally stopped in to get breakfast for lunch, but then I saw their actual lunch menu and I was like uhm yasssss! *drooling* - it all sounded so good!   I settled on the turkey burger with potatoes (instead of greens haha) and OMG it was deeelish!! The flavors were great and I loved that it was so juicy! Often they're dry and lackluster, but I don't eat red meat so I'll take what I can get when I'm craving a burger. Even someone at work asked me the next day where I had gotten it because it looked that good.  The service was great (although my order was for to-go), the place was clean and fresh! Great vibe/decor. Me likeeey! I'll definitely be back!

I'm a fan! Cool concept and nice decor!  I came here for a drink before an event and thoroughly enjoyed their chill vibe. I went around 5:00pm on a Thursday and was the only person in the place for a little while. The gal that greeted me was instantly so friendly and even struck up some conversation as I waited for my friend, which was nice!   I only had one drink, the Cirino cider, and it was good! Definitely didn't leave you with cotton mouth like Angry Orchard does, or the like. My friend had an Orange Blossom beer and she loved it! Plus they had a Yelp offer (or what I'm assuming is their happy hour at the time) of $2 off beers and $3 off wines. Throw a little jenga into the mix and we were chillin! Perf!  The place is 'very' small. Some people may not like that because I imagine being able to find seats on a busy night would be hit or miss, but that's what makes it different! Not every place needs to be huge enough to accommodate the entire city, that type of vibe can ruin the exclusivity of it.   I can't say much else about the food/drinks because I only had one, but everything including the service was great. I'll definitely be back!

Immediately upon pulling up I was greeted by a friendly gentleman. He asked if I needed gas or an oil change, I said no and then waited for a car wash attendant. I just wanted the Basic wash, but the next attendant talked me into spending "just $3 more" on The Works so that I could have the interior wiped down. I agreed because they weren't going to do it otherwise.   The first attendant then came back and tried to talk me into getting my windshield replaced because he spotted a couple of little star cracks. Annoying! I hate when car washes do this. I just want you to take the dirt off of my car please! Thanks! Grr.  Anywhooo... I paid, went and had lunch and came back. My car was finished by then. I got in and the safety pins I had in my console tray were now on my seat. I got to sit on them before I realized. Lucky me! Because luckily they weren't open. The coins I also had in my console tray were now in my cup holder and some were definitely missing. Pennies and maybe a dime, but regardless why were my things tossed about and not put back where they originally were? Hmm... also their handy work was mediocre, nothing spectacular and there were definitely still marks and dirt on the outside of my car. I also paid for "the works" wash, remember, but I never got my cherry air freshener. Fun!  I think car washes these days are so focused on getting people in and out in a hurry that they compromise quality, but what do I know. I will pay $16.99 for a half ass wash if it means I don't have to do it in this Arizona heat.
