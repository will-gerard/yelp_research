This place is on the way to the Ballpark so its convenient. We're visiting from Germany so waffle fries were a must. We selected a great location. The service was friendly, fast and we even were waited on while sitting down to eat our meals. The management and workers brought us food and mid meal drink refills and other items. I do commend this location!

Since this Target is close to the ballpark for Kansas City, it gets high marks for selling decently priced Kansas City shirts! Its well organized, has friendly cashiers, and typical Target layout. Security at the entrance and friendly cashiers whom are very fast at check-out. However, it does not have a Starbucks, so only 4 stars, BUT its next to a Barnes & Noble that does sell coffee.

Don't let the location or appareance inside/outside fool you. The food is authentic and service is superb. The coffee is good and fresh. The coke is served in a glass bottle (so delicious) and the food delivery is fast. Its very small but very efficient. First comes drinks then a basket of chips with two different salsas. Next is the main meal you ordered. The tacos are so damn good, as well as the fajitas. Free refills on coffee and attentive service with great prices! We will eat here again.

I wasn't impressed with this Jo-Ann's location. The management wasn't very friendly, but the cashiers and other staff were friendly. They lock-up the Sharpie oil markers so if you're looking for them, don't walk out. Just as management and they'll get them out of the cabinet up front. There is plenty of parking and its not terribly hard to get in-out, but I wouldn't come here again.

We had some spectacular service at Brooks Brothers and JCrew. Van-Heusen service was lacking but the prices were spot on for non-iron short sleeve dress shirts for only $15 each! We're visiting from Germany so I highly recommend this shopping area. The other malls we visited didn't have as nice a store selection. We found close parking immediately, its open/outdoor style so the weather was nice and the bathroom stalls were all handicap size so all shopping bags would fit as well. Highly recommend this place for a full wardrobe of shopping. Other stores we visited were Gap and Levi.
