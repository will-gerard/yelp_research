This place was just half ass. $15 per person and it doesn't even include a drink is awful. They also don't RO their water and even a lemon couldn't make it taste right. The crab legs were tiny and didn't have much taste. NONE of the food was above 140 degrees as it should be. I had a plate of cold food every time. I'm surprised I didn't get sick. Such a waste of money. I will never go back and I will tell as many people as I can how awful it is.

I like the food. It's tasty and you get such large portions for the money I always get 2-3 meals out of it. In fact, I never even finish my pork fried rice. Really good Hot and Sour soup. Their eggrolls are fantastic. Also, the egg foo yung is delish! I can tell they make it their and not serve up the frozen stuff.

Some co-workers and I frequent Tasty Thai and it's the best I've had around here. I've had good but for the money it's first rate.
