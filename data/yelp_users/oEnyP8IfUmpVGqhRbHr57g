Went to try their gluten-free roll. Of course the hot dogs are authentic and delicious. The roll is soft, warm and chewy. Sadly it is microwaved, not steamed. The charbroiled dogs and toppings were very tasty and definitely satisfied the craving for that authentic ball park frank, Chicago-style dog experience.

I've been taking my Saab, Nissan, Toyota, Dodge and now Subaru here for nearly 10 years. From great customer service to honest deals and low prices, you can count on Dave Enriquez and Dave Hanna to fix your cars speedily and fairly, every time. Stop paying more than you need to and give these guys your automotive repair business. They completely replaced the engine on my 350z and it works better and drives smoother than ever! I'm happy to recommend them and give them a well earned five star rating.

Fast, friendly atmosphere with great BBQ. I gotta tell you though, I always get their cheeseburger. I think it's in the top 5 burgers anywhere in the country. The spicy & sweet pickles and smoked bacon are just superb. You would be hard pressed to find a better burger anywhere.   I usually get a side salad with it because their side salads are bigger and fresher than most places and they home-made ranch dressing is also among the best you'll ever have anywhere.  I also recommend the catfish fingers appetizer.

Wow, I'm going to have to give my first awful review. Waited 15 minutes for our first waiter visit, then another 15 minutes for a glass of water, so we were 45 minutes in before ordering. I had such high hopes for a good sea food experience in the desert. Their menu says, "fresh fish flown in daily," but I know what frozen filets taste like. I ordered the naked halibut. The Brussels sprouts were flavorful, burnt and very oily. Oily as in sitting in a pool of oil. The halibut might have been okay if it had come out to the table on time but it had obviously sat in the window for at least 15 or 20 minutes, because it was maybe just barely luke warm and extremely dry. I was tempted to suffer through it with a smile but three bites in I crunched into a small pebble. I gave up after that. My wife ordered the redfish risotto. The risotto was decent but the fish was cold, dry and over salted. Son ordered chicken fingers. They were extra extra well done (over fried) as well, and he said the fries tasted like cardboard. Truly disappointing.

After reading reviews from several other dog parks in the area, I realize this is the best dog park ever. It's absolutely huge, open every day, has shade, benches, and water, a 1/4 mile walking track around the perimeter, gorgeous trees and lots of friendly regulars who clean up after their dog and even other rare dog owners who forgot to bring a bag. During the evening, you can with little league games going on. We bring our pugs and husky a few times a week. It gets a little muddy after it rains. Awesome!

I stopped in today for lunch and it was very good. Like many good Indian restaurants, it smells amazing the moment you walk in the door. Quiet and non-pretentious, you just walk up to the counter and place your order for South Indian vegetarian cuisine. My friend recommended I try one of their dosas. I'm gluten-free, so I double checked if it was made with flour. Happily, the lovely woman explained it was like a pancake made of lentils. Mine was enormous - three times the size of the plate - and filled with potato and peas. Delicious and highly recommended. I will be going back for sure.

I used to live in Chicago, just off Devon street. If you're not familiar with north Chicago, it's like little India and has 3 or 4 of the best Indian restaurants in America.   So I know good Indian food. I don't need a menu to order. I know what I want and the best dishes. I thought I would have to go back to Chicago for those rich, complex, amazing, delicious Indian flavors.  I was wrong. Passage to India is the best Indian restaurant in Arizona. Go here or order takeout for dinner, please. You will not regret it. Everything is fresh, consistent and authentic.

I met bartender, Jaime, and owner Denise, at New Times Best of Phoenix, and we've come 3 out of 4 Sundays since. The food is way, way above average for a sports bar, and the atmosphere is friendly and laid back. It really does feel like you're going over to the neighbor's... Except this Nabers has 15 TVs, a terrific chef and lots of brews on tap and plenty of microbrews. I'm enjoying an Arrogant Bastard Ale as I write this. Definitely go! See you at the Nabers!

I just tried the turkey wrap & fries and it was one of the best wraps I ever had. Fries were steaming hot, too.

We'd become big time fans of Lenero's over on the west side, but it recently closed down, sadly, leaving the Scottsdale location as the only place in town to enjoy their amazing "New Mexican" cuisine. My personal favorite are the barbacoa tacos. They're spicy and the meat is so tender and more flavorful than any others I've had elsewhere. Their beans are excellent, and the chicken pasta is also a family favorite. They have a full bar and a great patio outside. They cook on applewood from their family ranch, and the care they take in preparing meals is surprising given how quickly the food comes out of the super clean kitchen. Worth the drive if you're not in Scottsdale!
