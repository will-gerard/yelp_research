I rented a small trailer yesterday and it was a very good experience with Jason at Fish's Hitches.  This location is dedicated to rental trucks, trailers and installing trailer hitches.  I find this is attractive because the my goal is to arrive to do my rental business and leave without delay.  Being a smaller operation than most large centers, Jason has an excellent knowledge of what works and what doesn't work.  This was not my first rental from Fish's nor will it be my last.  My only regret is that with his popularity, his parking lot can get a bit crowded at times.  I do recommend this location for your moving truck or trailer needs.

This is a hometown favorite.  I stopped in this evening for simple BBQ sandwich but made it a bit "hotter" with some of their habenaro sauce.  Love this super casual family restaurant.

Their menu has much to offer but my kids love coming to Sal's for the pizza.  They are particularly fond of the garlic knots.

This "gathering place" is a super coffee shop for enjoying all the sights and sounds of Heritage Gilbert.  Free WIFI makes it convenient for checking email msgs or writing a quick Yelp review!

I had a problem with a coolant leak on the top of my 2008 Ford Expedition engine.  I had had my AC repaired a year earlier at this shop without concern so I when to Greulich's on Ray Road again to have them provide me with an estimate to repair the coolant leak.  I arrived about 4 PM on a Weds and explained the problem.  With little discussion, the Service Writer (Kelly15) took my keys to have a mechanic "take a look".  There was no discussion about any fees to get an estimate.  About 45 minutes later, I was presented with an estimate of $1,558.93 to have a couple hoses replace and to remove and replace the engine intake manifold.  I was dumbfounded because it was obvious that the hose was leaking at some of the manufacturing joints and spraying down on the engine.  I challenged the Service Writer and said I didn't think the manifold was the problem.  He assured me that his "Master Certified" mechanic confirmed the need of manifold replacement.  In disbelief, I said that I would have to have another garage provide me with an estimate before proceeding at which time, I was asked to pay $58.50 plus tax for the mechanic's time.  Bull S!, I was never advised that an "estimate" came with a $58,50 shop bill.  With a firm (read LOUD) voice, I said "I'm not paying your bill" and my vehicle was returned to me.  Long story short, I purchased the replacement hose assembly from a retail automotive store and the necessary antifreeze to replace the hose.  After 200 miles, I observe no additional leakage.  Total repair cost in parts was $139.95 and a couple of hours of my time.  Total SAVINGS to me $1,418.98.    It goes without a second thought that I will not be using Greulich's services and will have reason to tell others why I have reached my decision.

My family and I had a very nice breakfast at the Henhouse Cafe.  The food was very good and the coffee was plentiful.  The only miss was that it being a Sunday morning, the restaurant was full but not overfull.  We were a bit surprised that while the service was timely and attentive, we had to wait longer that we expected to receive our breakfast meal.  We have eaten at the Henhouse a couple of times but this was the first time for the delay.  We'll continue to go back and recommend this breakfast/lunch restaurant to our friends.

Repeat visit for me, great coffee and friendly staff keeps me coming back.  My son had some organic banana bread that he was nice enough to share.  Of course he was happy knowing there was free WiFi.
