Love love love the Crêpe Bar but had such an unfortunate experience with a friend. I talked about how wonderful this place was & how delicious it is & just the overall atmosphere was so chill. When we went to order, my friend who has server food allergies found a crêpe she like & could eat and ordered it, unwrapped without the crêpe. I was really taken back when they said they couldn't do that because that have to present the food in a certain manner, REALLY? Completely ridiculous if you ask me, haven't been back since which is a bummer.

I am always thoroughly impressed with my washes from Rinse n Ride, especially for the price that you pay, I don't think there is a better value in the East Valley. I try to get my car washed once a week or so, so it's nice not having to pay $12 each visit but also knowing that my car is going to be actually clean definitely sets the bar and keeps me coming back. I also love the personal vacuuming stations because it gives you more freedom in making sure the inside of your car is getting the same amount of cleanliness as the outside. I would definitely recommend Rinse n Ride to anyone!

My suggestion to the twat bartenders is that when a new customer walks in you should try to be a little quieter when talking shit about us. I do commend you though on being able to get me to leave in under 60 seconds, I will never be returning to this place again, but then again you probably don't care. And to the tool of a bouncer who just made a douchey comment about unhappy we looked walking out, you probably should have asked why we were leaving within a minute of walking in.

Another win for Rinse-n-Ride with their new location in Gilbert! As per usual, Rinse-n-Ride is one of the best drive thru car washes to be hitting the Easy Valley - not only is it fast and affordable but my car actually gets washed! Love the quality of the wash and how easy it is to get a quick rinse on a busy day and know my car will actually be clean. I appreciate on days where I have more time to have access to the free vacuum's and be able to make the inside of my car look as good as the outside. I would recommend Rinse-n-Ride to any of my friends and family who are looking for a top quality, quick, and easy car wash.
