One of favorite places on earth! The fish is very fresh the prices are reasonable which I suppose helps keep the fish fresh. Unfortunately many Sushi bars don't even meet those standards. Thankfuly there are a few places on town that do and Sakana is one of those. But what makes Salamander my favorite is the people. The chefs are friendly and engaging. The servers are a blast. And some of the nicest people hang out there including the likes of Kurt Warner and Larry Fitzgerald.  The sushi experience is more than just food it is also fun and Sakana is the complete package

This place is OK I guess. The fish is fresh but not a big variety.  There are many other OK sushi bars in Scottsdale if you want ok sushi and no personality from the sushi chefs and servers go here. If you want ok sushi and at least the fun interaction that is part of the sushi experience go to one of the other ok sushi places. BUT if you want great sushi and fun go to Sakana's not to far from here and have the total package

Have you ever noticed the people who give the worst reviews are using groupon, living social or some other type of coupon. When will restaurant owners ever learn people don't appreciate under priced food. They don't see it as a value they just see it as cheap.   As for Grazie they have simply the best pizza you will find. If you are in Old Town Scottsdale and can only eat at one place you must choose Grazie

My wife and I have been coming here regularly  since we moved to Scottsdale 10 years ago. It was one of the first things we fell in love with when we moved here. The service and decor are first class. We just love the feel of a high end Persian restaurant.   Of course the most important thing is the food and it lives up to the requirement and beyond. We always have left overs and they call to me from my refrigerator all night.  This is hands down my favorite restaurant in town

The best in town! Flo's is closer to home and is not bad BUT George and Son is way worth the extra drive. The food is the most important thing in a restaurant to me and George and Son has simply the best Chinese food I have ever had. The bonus is the service. Always friendly and fast. George himself is usually there and he has a way of making everyone feel special like a VIP. Now they also have entertainment on Fridays and Saturdays its a blast

Gave it an extra star because of my good memories of this place. Now however if you like sushi don't go here. Fish is not fresh and that is the biggest sin for a sushi place

I cannot believe all the people here saying they liked it under the old ownership. Please if you liked it before you don't like sushi. I seriously Walmart sushi was 10 times better and Walmart sushi is horrible.   Now I am not saying the new guys are much better but you really could not get much worse than it was.

Losses 3 stars because the bathrooms are disgusting. That's to bad because the food is good for a chinesse buffet. I mean we all know what to expect from this type of resturant .   On the postive side the smell of the bathroom made me "loose my lunch" if you know what I mean, so I did have room for more food. It is an all you can eat place and as I said the food is ok

Now I remember why I don't come here but go to TomThumb instead,  even though this is a cross the street from my office.  I just want my car washed U don't want to have to sit through a 10 minute time share like sales pitch on all the possible add ons, future detaling appointment, oil change and windshield replacement.   It is kind of a shame becuse it is a nice facility but it is just not worth the hassle.

This is definitely a regular lunch spot for me. The food is very good, very fresh and very healthy. Some people have written that it is expensive I guess compared to the 99 cent menu at the Burger King in the same center they might be right BUT 5 bucks for a big tasty gyro is not in my book even almost too expensive. The chicken wrap is one of my favorites and at under 6 bucks a great value

Wow this is the only food place left on the D concorse the only reason I am here again. Of all the options that were here the very worst and worst by a huge margin is the only one to remain. Please some one open something anything! Bad food bad service and high prices what more can a person ask for

Yohan is and always will be the master of the sauce.  So many innovative rolls and sashimi plates.  Some times it may take a little time to get your order but sushi doesn't come from a microwave.    The people here are more than friendly and the music is very cool.   If you want to enjoy your evening then you can't go wrong coming here. If you want to just cram down some sushi and move on (we all of days like that) then go to  a revolving sushi bar. This place is for fun.

Where do I start? Went there during happy hour they had a table tent with the happy hour specials. They listed a few drink and appetizer specials. So I picked the humus but they did not have stuffed grape leaves (one of my favorite things) on the happy hour list. No big deal I will pay the regular price for them, so I looked on the regular menu and no stuffed grape leaf appetizer. They did however have them as an entr√©e. I asked the server and she said no problem she could make up an appetizer for us.  The humus was almost edible and the stuffed grape leaves were just simple horrible. The stuffing had a strange unpleasant taste. The grape leaves were though and stringy and all of this was covered in a clumpy thick white gravy? Good thing they had drink specials to was the taste out of my mouth.   The main meal was bland and greasy. The servers and the manger were sitting at a table diagonal from us having a better time the most of the dinners. A side from being entertained by the staffs' conversation my wife and I noticed while we were eating other customers kept walking past bring back plates of food. We assumed that they had some sort of dinner buffet. We were wrong on the way out we noticed a sign that said they had a free happy hour buffet. And that the horrible stuffed grape leaves that our server so kindly was able to get us as an appetizer and charge us $7.00 for was part of the free buffet along with our happy hour special price $4.00 humus.   So if you want to pay for really bad food brought to you by people who just don't care this is the place for you.

If you want a typical Thai restaurant with 15 generic noodle dishes then this is not the place for you.   If instead you like variety of creative and delicious options then you will love this place.

Let's start this way. I could not decide between pork or beef tacos. I asked the server he said that the chef was known for her pork treatment. Chef ?? pork treatment?? These are words I would have never expected to hear at an airport restaurant. Way cool. And the food itself delicious again very unexpected at an airport. This is not the least expensive place here but well worth it. You are about to be crammed on to a SWA plane at least enjoy this one luxury.

That was horrible! The "food" is pure sugar. I could only eat two bits  (I have no idea why I had the second one). it was so sweet I can already feel cavities forming. The best $10 i ever wasted was leaving my plate full and walking out. Never again leason learned

People ask do they have Chicago style pizza or New York style pizza? The answer is they have Italian pizza and it is the best you will find any where around these parts. As a matter of fact everything about this place is very Italian. This is a class operation

You may ask why 5 stars well let me explain this place sucks but they know they suck and they fully embrace it. The people working there are always pleasant and helpful but they make no excuse for menu of pre made sandwiches in the frig and ballpark nachos   Why I like it here it is never crowded the bartender understands that I am stuck at this airport much longer than I should be (as usual ) and handles me appropriately.  Oh did I mention that it is not crowded.  No leaving Las Vegas idiots standing in the middle of the walkway. Or those brilliant people that thought bring their 3 kids, all still in a stroller,  to Las Vegas is a good idea.  It is not that I dislike people but when I am leaving Las Vegas I have generally had enough of people.  If you have that feeling too then this is the place for you. If not please please don't come here and ruin it for the rest of us.

Were do I start let's start with the service. It could not have been better. We sat at the bar and Adam took care of us. We had a great time with Adam who guided us through an awesome dining experience. If you go to the bar ask for Adam. However there is one problem virtually all the bar tenders are named Adam. But no worries it seems they are all above average. Ok now the important part the food. It having Ramsey's name carries high expectations. I am happy to say they were meet. I need to particularly point out the Shepherd's Pie. This is something I would normally avoid because of my stepfather's failed attempts. His was the worst thing I ever ate. Gordon's was the best thing I have ever had.  I will be back again and again. Finally a famous chief opens a very approachable place and blows away expectations. Good Job!!!

Okay this place is good. No I mean really good.  It is a Fox restaurant so you know the service is top notch but the food omg.  Did I say this place was good.  Maybe I should stop now before too many people show up. This is easily Fox's best and that says a lot.  Oh yea did I say this place is good.

This is too funny. First let's get this out of the way the food was good fast and I appreciate the low carb option.  The service was great. Now for the funny part I came here without checking Yelp first. I ordered my food and started to eat it. Before opening Yelp I already knew why the haters would give it one or two stars and I was correct.  They complain about the price. I am sorry but if $10 is too much for a quality lunch then the problem is not so much with the restaurant but with your finances.  But what really aggravates me about this folks is don't they look at the menu!  This place has a giant menu over the counter with the prices clearly marked.  Here is some free financial advice read the menu first if you are cutting close on funds walk the 20 feet across the parking lot to Jack in the Box. I know the food is not as high a quality and healthy at Jack.   I bet most of the folks here complaining about paying $10 for quality food are also for increasing the minimum wage.   Sorry rant over. This place is great the food is great the people are great and you won't do wrong by coming here but know they don't have a 99 cent value menu.

I can't tell you how excited I was when I saw this place was open. The original location was near my old office and went there all the time.  Then sadly my office moved north and for the past couple years I have been forced to settle for just an occasional visit.  But now they have opened a new place very close to my new office.!   Same great quality real food same very friendly people working there But there is one thing that is different the parking is so much better

I hesitated in writing a review because this place is soooo good and I did want my little secret spot to get out but it has. You just  can't keep food this good and service this friendly secret for too long.   Only negative is if you are going for dinner you probably should call ahead for a table.

Good food awesome service. If you just want to chill and have fun this is the place. I can't put my finger on it. Is it the decor,  the live music the food or the staff that I always have a great time when I am here and leave feeling awesome.  Oh wait I know it is the awesome fries. No kidding they have  awesome fries on the menu and they are seriously LEGIT

It was hard to give them only 2 stars.  I love the real Joe's Real BBQ but the airport location not so much.  Don't get me wrong the food is still great, if you can get it. The staff is completely incompetent. They have a serious management issue here. The funny thing is the way I understand the deal with airport is the local restaurant open in the airport but they must use  the professional" management team contracted by the airport.  I just hope this poor performance doesn't reflect poor on the  real Joe's which is still one of best run restaurants in town.

I would give it all 5 stars but i don't want it to go to their heads.  They just opened and I have only been here this one time.  Anyway I am so happy a more than decent sushi bar is in the neighborhood.  I am sure i will be adding the 5th star soon. By the way the service was awesome Mike and John are tops.

I really do try hard to like this place, this is at least my fourth time here but I think I will give up. The service and location are good. The food is okay I guess I do question how healthy it is, not much in the way of low carb options and $21 for an okay salad and ice tea is really crazy. Oh well plenty of other places in this town.
