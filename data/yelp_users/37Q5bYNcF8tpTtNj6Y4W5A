Denny's all around is pretty good usually come for the breakfast (like everyone else lol) and the nachos cause man those things are delicious. Unfortunately today was a bit of a disappointment. They seemed very under staffed and the rest of the people in the dining room looked really irritated. There was a dining room full of people and come to find out there was only one cook in the kitchen and man I feel bad for the guy.   Anyways food wasn't good at all the chili that they put on the nachos tasted just like tomato sauce, had the jalepeno bottle caps and they were completely burnt. Mozzarella cheese sticks had no cheese which I'm assuming it melted out because that was also over cooked. If you have one cook trying to knock out a dining room full of orders then you'll get results like this. If labor is something this location is concerned with then take away a server and bring in a cook to help as long as the food is coming out hot, tasty and looking good then everyone will be happy.   I gave two stars because the servers were moving with a purpose one of the guys was even sweating that's good stuff. Ill come back not anytime soon though they should really up there game because IHOP is rigt across the street.

Everytime I go to this Pizza Hut I'm treated very nicely and the food is always great!! I really don't go anywhere else for pizza because they always make it right here. Good staff good food can't complain about any of those things

Not very friendly and very unresponsive in the drive thru had to ask numerous if they received what I had asked for. Took really long to get our order. We asked for Powerade and got Dr Pepper instead,  asked for hot sauce and got home with nothing. Also did not get the correct change back. Pretty frustrating stuff but what can you do place is been the same way for a while now
