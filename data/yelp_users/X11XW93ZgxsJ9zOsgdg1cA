What a fun place! Spent the day there yesterday. Wasn't to busy which was nice, so we were able to ride all the coasters, zip line & play some miniature golf! The Dessert Store Roller Coaster was our favorite with a close 2nd the Sky Diver- Free Fall..  The zip line was a BLAST. They also offer ( directly on the other side) an "On The Ropes" obstacle course.  Log ride,  bummer boats, ram rode-to a go cart race track. Lots to do at this entire park. Arcade games indoors.. Minute golf offers up to 4 courses to choose from. Didn't purchase any food. Bottled Waters $3 each. Drink prices for soda vary by size & many soda machines are located throughout the park as well.  Big industrial fans with water mists are "ON" for those extremely hot days too! Staff was pleasant and they seem to work very hard to insure your safety. It would be nice to smile and tell them "Thank YOU". This goes a long way!! Note: No Coolers allowed inside the park. Don't wear flip flops, tennis shoes are required for all rides. Yelp may offer a $5 off (each ticket) special at times for "checking in". There are NO children's prices offered everyone pays the same fee unless they are under a certain height. FYI: I have given them 4 out of 5 stars ; with this being an older park many upgrades and repairs need to be done. Also, a maintenance crew should be cleaning out the golf areas light fixtures, so many Cobb webs could cause a fire! Repairs should be done to some of the golf course pipelines the balls go through as well as the flaps they are suppose to "pop" out of. Many foundational concrete cracks- to bug issues at night too!

Stopped in today - needing to get some used cleats for my son. Found a pair of Nike's his size and purchased for $20. Pretty good condition. Sales associates didn't go out of their way to offer their assistance & didn't greet when I walked in the door: but I did ask for help & they ( guy & a girl) both were very pleasant.

This is a great movie theater. Captain America was a enjoyable flick to see here! Reclining seats : Dolby Digital Theater- furnishes a memorable experience. Employees make a great effort in offering their rewards program. It's called the "AMC Stubs" which provides free upgrades on popcorn & drinks. This is unlimited for a full year. You also get $10 to use for every $100 you spend. With this, you don't have to pay the additional fees when ordering tickets on-line. In concession they offer as much butter as your arteries can handle. LOL The sodas are a touch screen option, so choose any flavor they provide. Theaters are clean and staff is super friendly. My kinda movie place. Will be back again "for sure" & plan to take advantage of their outstanding rewards program.

Came in at 4 PM.  Wanted to try the New S'more Frap... Friendly Customer Service. Seems to have many regulars there including a sweet staff member from the local theater that reminded them all to smile :) Ended up getting the Vanilla Bean and the NEW S'More  Frappuccino: Both were great!

Enjoyed our meal here! Had the enchilada plate, rolled taco combo & Carne Asada burrito (w/enchilada sauce) combo. All our meals were served with rice and beans. Clean restaurant, older tables & chairs. Salsa squeeze bottles hot & mild at every table. Service was friendly and food arrived in a timely manor. Authentic & delicious. Generous portions. Meals are accompanied by a small plate of fresh sliced lime wedges.

Haven't been to K-Mart in such a long time! Blue Light Special deals daily! LOL Store seems clean and well organized. Summer sales on display in front of the store. Clearance items & low prices on clothing, shoes & more! Little Caesar's inside the store offers pizza's at a low & affordable cost. Today, it was a Large Pepperoni Pizza for $5.  Customer Service is friendly and pleasant...

Visit this store yesterday. We are from Out of State & my boys came across this place server all days prior- to me visiting.  Staff was friendly and offered assistance. We knew exactly " what" we wanted : when my boys were in they found a Giant's Baseball T-Shirt ( we had been looking for, for a Grad gift).. The shirt was at a clearance price and was an official MLB "T" we picked that up for a great price & also a car decal. The store has some great things to choose from and much to offer.  My son will be returning in the Fall to attend ASU & we will be moving here as a family. We will be sure to stop back in & get some ASU apparel once we get back, they have a good selection to pick from! Prices are standard and clearance a plus!

Party of three lunchtime on Wednesday 11-17 Our waitress was Katrina, she was amazing! She went above and beyond to give excellent service. Had the chicken wings with the garlic parm, they were good. Tried the roasted Brussels Sprouts & they were delicious. Caesar Salad always crisp & fresh with just the right amount of dressing. Saved the "best for last" as a birthday treat- peanut butter, s'more pizookie cookie. Soooooo YUMMY!!!

Party of 8, came in at 7:30 PM. Not a long wait. Brought in friends from out of State to experience such a great menu with so much variety, everything is always spot on & delicious. Our waiter was Micheal-great customer service, attentive & truly outstanding customer service! Two pasta & meatball dishes. Great portion, good for the price; couldn't finish & plenty left over for another meal! Had a new item on the menu I had to try: a baked pasta that comes with penne. I asked for spaghetti style pasta noodles instead which was accommodated. It was really good. Guacamole Burger was devoured. LOL Cooked to perfect, thin fries golden crispy & delish! Atlantic Salmon is served with a Chardonnay cream butter sauce & seasonal vegetables. This is a classic dish! We have been dining at BJ's Brew Houses throughout the state of California & Denver for years. I had said it before (in numerous reviews) & will say it again, menu has some much to offer everyone!! They will accommodate and or substitute almost anything requested. This is one of the reasons we always end up at BJ's Brew House.  Recently moved to Arizona & couldn't be happier to have found a BJ's Brew House near us. Not to mention along with it being a great location with a stellar staff (that we've experiences the 3 times we've been) such a plus!! Met the head chef- just a few weeks back- Kristen pleasant, professional & it "starts from the top"!  Way to go guys!! We will continue to come in & enjoy our restaurant experience with you!  See you soon-

Came in after a gymnastics event on Saturday right at lunch time. Busy, but seated right away! We had a party of 9 -served by Jessica; she was outstanding! Had the lettuce wraps, fresh , crispy leaves of lettuce served with a Asian chicken mixture: accompanied by a side of hot mustard & teriyaki sauce! Really good, wonderful light meal. Pizza (6 sliced/ med) Pepperoni & had them add fresh garlic and basil. BBQ chopped chicken salad was piled high to perfection! Caesar salad was a generous portion for a main meal. Side order of fries same deal! Pasta dishes are always on point! Again, this is the place we always end up. Great service, great food for all. Many options!!

Have been seeing Dr. Lines for about 6 months. Had to upgrade medication for acne as first type wasn't working. Dr. Lines seems very knowledgeable and is pleasant, personality is somewhat unique.. LOL At times communication could be a little better as far as explaining the details to where there completely understood.  Front office staff are pleasant/ unless you have an issue with having to reschedule or cancel. They advise you that a $25 fee will be processed or charged to you for any cancelation in less than a 24 hour time frame. Had been given a list of location to get blood work done: three of the five locations were no longer in business. We found this out after going to each one of them.  Pharmacy & location need to be on the same page with prescription requirements.  Other than that, we have been happy with the progress-it's been slow, but it has improved.

This place is the "BOMB". First time eating here when we moved to Arizona from California and by far beats many of the So.Cal. fast food Mexican joints! Carne Asada meat is flavorful and delicious. The burritos are good size for the price. The chicken enchiladas are so good, sauce is a little greasy. Rolled tacos super crunchy with sour cream, real avocado quac. & shredded cheese on top! Restaurant is very clean. Love the salsa bar and my absolute "awesome sauce" is the thick green one. They offer about 3-4 hot sauces, carrots, & pickled onions. We love this place and will be back on a regular occasion to try out more of the menu! Stayed tuned for more reviews-

Have shopped at this location now a few times. We are new to the area, live in Gilbert, but my daughter goes to school near this grocery store. One of the reasons I like this location and the appeal of the store: they offer a few things more than my local Fry's. Daily Fresh Sushi is made in the middle of the Meat Dept. it's a small station set up to create and sell : can even watch the employees make it on site!! When I discovered this I purchased sushi two days in a row!! Many options to choose from too! It's super yummy! Very clean store, friendly associates and they also sell Starbucks; that's a plus! Zac, one of the floor managers was very helpful with a request I had. I plan to shop @ this location more often & I'll be sure to pick up their fresh amazing sushi every time too!

Had lunch here on Thursday August 20th about 12:30 PM. Wasn't to busy. My oldest son just started at ASU, so a very convenient location to visit since it's near the college. Customer service was extremely good. Had Julia (staff trainer) who was and her new trainee. Very attentive to our needs and request. Food was good and so was the service. Complemented their efforts with having two servers at our table. We will be back again!

Outstanding customer service! We had brought in a disk with 2 images we wanted photo copied. Two different styles of High School Graduation Announcements. We dropped off all the info and details, filled out the forms with the onsite staff member on Thursday 4/28 to have printed & picked up on Friday 4/29/16. My husband arrived Friday evening after work and went to purchase them: only to have the sales associate let him know they had to reprint as there was a small white line directly through them ALL. This process brought over three other staff members to assist in a timely manner. I believe the names of these OD members were Tyler, Manny and Alma. They were able to reprint, copy and cut as well as offer us envelopes due to this mistake on their end.  We were happy with the outcome of the announcements and the quality customer service we received. I called and spoke with Andrew M. this morning to make him aware in a positive way, of how his staff had provided assistance in this situation. If you need prints - I highly recommend Office Depot, we have been using them for years. If you join the rewards program you will receive additional savings. First time to this location, but will be happy to return as we know they will always strive to make things right and give excellent service too!

Came in looking for a used baseball mitt. Picked up a fairly good one for my son who lost his. Had a few to choose from and found one at a reasonable price & in nice condition. We plan to go back this week and look at their baseball cleats. We need to replace those too!  Better prices buying used, most items are in good shape. Have a few NEW items in stock like Oakey Backpacks at a great price! BTW- they take in ALL sports items "year round".

Came in for dinner on Halloween Night. Perfect, wasn't to busy. Sat in the bar area. Quickly greeted by our server. Got our drink order that away! Orders the 20 piece traditional wings with 4 sauces. Always get the Thai Curry- so delish. Spicy Garlic is a always a winner- also had the Honey BBQ & Garlic Parm they both are really good! Two new sauces. Goats Pepper: had a sample, it's WAY HOT!! The Bourbon Honey Mustard got a sample of that too-super sweet but tasty! They need to bring back the Angry Orchard Sauce  amazing & mix that with a little ghosts pepper for a "sweet/ hot" that would be killer! Manger that was on duty; checked on us serval times. Service/ Server ( Batman) was good.LOL One of our favorite places to dine! We will "for sure" be back to this location after our experience here!

This location is suppose to be open at 8:00 AM.? I arrived about 8:20 AM only to find the doors were closed and no lights on. Many notes on the window such as their hours of operations (Open @ 8 AM)... Please note ( as on their window as well) they DON'T notarize & they encourage you to go to their "other location" on Higley which I did: I "just" had to mail off a large envelope.

First time in was Saturday 4/30 in the evening about 7:30 PM. We had heard the wings were really good, so we wanted to FINALLY make our way in to try them out.  There was a wait to be seated to dine, but the bar was opened so we decided to go sit in there. On our way through the dinning room we noticed big barrels filled with salty roasted peanuts. In these barrels are big scoops & small metal tins are at each table to fill, munch on the delights and you can throw your debris right on the floor!  Super cool atmosphere- western appeal and menu consist of some pretty vamped up comfort foods with a twist. Saloon style latrines that were clean, stocked and well maintained...LOL We ended up doing all appetizers after we ordered drinks from the bartender. Specials on vodka drinks $4 you can choose from 4 diffrent blends, "what a bargain"!! Many beers on tap & full bar services with big containers of peanuts on the counter all around us! WINGS; "you have to try":  the El'hefe and "Jess Jess" Wings- Delish!. El'hefe are outstanding and BOTH these type wings are fried, then grilled. They are a little bit more $ than the standard wings, but well worth it!! We also had the fried Mozzarella Egg Rolls, really crunchy & really tasty. I think they would have been better served with a sweet/ hot egg roll sauce or jalapeño jelly verses marinara, but that's just me! Attentive service from our bartender, and the staff that was " on top of it" with getting food out promptly. In speaking with the bartender & learning the history of this place, they had many location ( about 5) through the years; now just two left. This one here in Gilbert and the other in Chandler. We will definitely be back and will definitely have their wings again! If you haven't had the opportunity to try this place, highly suggest it. When we come back; we will be sure to explore more of the menu and some of the other options they offer on it..  Let's remember to support our "local restaurants"- Our Mom & Pop places "if u will" more often then the chain places! These privately owned location need the community to continue to dine with them & know that it's quality, uniquely blended, amazing food at an affordable price! You can't get that at the big stereotypical eateries!

Ordered traditional wings- Wednesdays are .60 cent a piece wings which runs cheaper than their other daily deals for the 8,12, & 24 count! We were able to choose 3 sauces (they will do one flavor for every 8 count ordered). The Sweet Chili was okay, Medium Hot was good & don't really recommend the Garlic Parmesan: super greasy sauce that is separated and you have to mix it up! Wings were average, but fairly saucy & were cooked through, but not really crunchy.  *You have to pay for ranch/ blue cheese dressing .75 cents each??* Ordered a personal pizza with up to 3 toppings: onion ( only one little sliver on each little slice) pepperoni & bacon hardly!  The best thing was the cinnamon strips 10 pieces total with 1 dip of icing. Price wasn't bad & those were pretty tasty!

Just a little small spot inside Subway's Sandwich Shop, but "heck we haven't seen one in years"! Ordered one dozen scrumptious donuts.  Took it all "to go". The 2 employees working, greeted us right as we walked in the door! Great memories in every bite that reminded us of our past as young kids going to our local neighborhood location, to enjoy a special morning treat. It was our daughters first time having Winchell's, so we recommend the chocolate twist donut-which she devoured! Can't wait to what's left in the AM with a cup of Dunkin Donuts Coffee...LOL

This location is average, not as good as the one in Gilbert. I ordered the Carne Asada taco, it's was good and lots of meat! They offer special everyday and so I added the Mondays "meal deal" of 3 rolled tacos with cheese. They offer only two salsas at their small little bar- a red ( it's ok) and a green ( not much flavor to it). At the other location I've been to they have a few more options for salas and the thick green one is the best!! I missed that here! They do offer radish & cucumber slices at no additional charge. Restaurant could use a good cleaning and someone on patrol with a fly swatter, but again it was just average.

Dined here on 8-29 about 8:30 PM. Double crusted bone in hot wings good, but needed additional sauce. Ordered the Blazing Texan Burger & asked for it in the flour tortilla like they do for the quesadilla burger which they accommodated. Clubhouse sandwich is always a favorite in our family, good with "Garlic Fries". You have to request them! Our waiter was Parley W. He was attentive to our needs and provided us with good service.

First time in today- I can see why this place is going out of business for many reasons; including the area. Security people staffed all over the store. Makes for a very uncomfortable shopping experience.  Not to mention the so called "'discounts". All WERE marked down with yellow tags that had been taken off ( not very well) & $$ are back to regular price then advertised as 20% off. Not much of "any type" of savings with a store " going out of business"...Store was messy in the woman's dept.. I picked up some things & made my way to the register, where 3 security guards were questioning a customer. The checkout girl started to ring me up for my purchases and I noticed an earring had come off of the package it was attached to. It was a set of three pairs / hoop earrings & as the one was lose- instead of putting it back on she lousily threw it in the plastic shopping bag. I asked her if it was broken and she say " O' no: I'm just putting it in there like that, it will be okay". After I got home & pulled the earrings out, the post was clearly broke off the earring. I am very upset as the cashier lied, stamped it with an "all sales are final" stamp on my receipt and now I have to go back to exchange it! I can see why their closing: lack of customer service, poor employees and a bad area= the doors closing soon!

Came in last night about 9:00 PM.  Looks like a lot of "locals" frequent this place! Friendly / Family Atmosphere!! Many were just finishing dinner and filtering out, so we were able to get a nice roomy booth. BUT: our hostess didn't come across as how I described the feel of this place. Our table unfortunately; still seemed to be a little dirty with bread crumbs that were left behind and a used utensil . It was a place setting for 5 (we were a party of 3) so we just took the clean items from the other dinner set(s). Our server was David. He greeted us nicely and told us of two seafood specials they were offering for the evening. He brought us ice cold waters & took are bar drink orders. As he was walking away he made mention that bread should be arriving. This was also directed to the servers assistant; but we didn't receive our bread for a good 20 minutes or so, it came out " just before our food arrive".. Our girl (13) has the Caesar salad: it was average & she also had the Mussels AND clams which she thoroughly enjoyed. She ate the entire appetizer & soaked up that seafood, garlicky wine broth with toasty garlic bread..  My husband had the Veal Parmigiana with melted mozzarella & their spicy marinara sauce. This was a great dish. It was accompanied with pasta ( underneath) & some really delicious green beans!  I started with a dinner salad with blue cheese dressing. I didn't enjoy this "at all" ? In Fact, I ended up giving it to my husband. It was the dark romaine tops ; chopped and piled high on the plate with a standard blue cheese dressing, no croutons, lots of shredded mozzarella & one tiny cherry tomato. My main course: I had the Spaghetti ( instead of Penne) Pasta Alla Vodka, amazing creamy tomato sauce with a bright punch of flavor.  Added with that- some fresh julienned basil on top! Perfect!! Started off a little rocky, but got back on track with the main courses.  David was very pleasant and engaged with us during our dinning experience, we will give him a "pass" for the delayed bread issue! LOL From our conversation with our server, the owners have a few other locations in the Scottsdale area. The Side Door, The Blind Pig and a Mexican Restaurant very near to here called : Carlsbad. We plan to try them all..

We are from California and discovered this place the last time we visited. We are back again and decide to stop in on 6/20. The food here is killer!! Just like home! FYI- Real Quac- This time we were in I had the combination plate with the taco & enchilada. The enchilada sauce is very tasty ( most places it's very bland). You can have shredded beef or chicken or one of each if you ask! The Horchata is one of the BEST tasting ones I've had.. Salsas are good and chilled at the salsa bar. Hot carrots prepped & pickled in small bags upon request, they are good. Everything that my family and I have ordered here is sooooo delicious.. Large portions for the price too! We always end up taking some home. We really enjoy this place and will be back again & again. The owners are very nice and accommodating too, such a plus!

Came in about 3:30 PM yesterday for a few beers & an appetizer. Place started to get packed do to the playoff football game. Server Kia was great; additional staff assistance good. It was impressive with how busy they ended up getting! Had the beer sampler $10 bucks! Ordered the hot wings, they are average. Offer two other sauces for the wings as another option- an oak stout BBQ & a spicy Asian. We got those as a side to "try" along with our HOT wings; BBQ is ok / Asian taste more like a salsa: usual taste, but both maybe better on the wings versus "on the side". Blue cheese & ranch seem to be a homemade dressing & wing platter includes carrots & celery. Had the peach ale beer- nice! Experience over all was pleasant.

We dined here for the first time on Monday Aug.18th about 7:00 PM. We met some friends who happened upon this gem a few years ago and highly recommended it. The place was busy, nice bar area up front and the dinning section is located further back. The menu is all Irish type meals. Something I'm very familiar with growing up having these dishes and being half Irish. So much to choose from and had a hard time deciding. Menu has so much to offer: including all the staples of a home cooked Irish traditional meal! Started with a great appetizer : seasoned potato balls that are deep fried & served with ranch and buffalo sauce- YUM!! The potato nacho's are gigantic and should be eaten as a meal. Serves at least 3-4 people! I had the corn beef sandwich and requested it wrap in a flour tortilla, it was delicious. My husband had a burger that came with bacon and a fried egg on top. One of the best burgers he has ever had! He ordered a few pairings of beers along with that, that went well & he enjoyed! You won't leave hungry with their portions. I feel a little expensive, but with the amount of food, presentation & atmosphere- well worth it. You have to try this place- amazing! Owner stopped by our table and inquired about our meal. Pleasant, friendly and told us some history of the restaurant. It's also indicated on their menu that the building was actually put together in Ireland and brought to the U.S. That's pretty cool! Truly an original..  BTW- if it's on the weekend or during any college event. You may want to go earlier as the night life and bar gets packed and it's a different crowd.

Came in on 8/29/15 about 1:30 PM in the afternoon. My son is attending ASU, so we were looking to pick up a few things for him for the school year. Many customers were there doing the "selling thing, which they do daily! Many customers browsing & staff members busy putting products on display! We found some t-shirts and a few pairs of quality shoes, we wanted to buy. The prices on some things were a little high ( in my opinion). So, just be careful as to what certain name brands cost & what you feel the re-sale price should be. If you think it's a great deal, then it is! If not you can always go elsewhere- like the thrift. Example: they had a pair of Van's for $34 used and we went to the outlet center that same day and paid less for a brand new pair that were almost exactly the same! I did picked up some adorable gold sandals for about $16. They were in good condition and I felt it was fairly priced. They take in trends and styles for all seasons. Currently, they are looking at fall clothing attire & buying based on the time of year. We will plan to go back soon. May look into selling & getting either store credit or cash the next time we're in!

Dined here Friday Night 4-17 about 8:15 PM. Service was good & food delicious. Had ordered 2 Pastrami Egg Burger - really good! Bearnaise burger & beer sample super good. Cuban Dip Sandwich was average-kinda bland tasting. Kids Meal -teriyaki style chicken- not worth the cost. Get something else from the kids menu or you'll have to share your meal with your child cause it just isn't enough. Truffle garlic fries are amazing!

First time here was yesterday. Great Mall with much to offer! Wide variety of stores and plenty of shops to choose from. Food court & many levels of appeal to this Mall. Lots of restaurants to choose from & enjoy while out shopping. Great place to visit if your from out of town or out of state.  You can spend most of they day here: if shopping at the mall is " your kinda thing"! We enjoyed our visit & thought it was a very nice Mall.

Located Inside Walmart, had lunch here today! Fast service and quick "turn around time" to get your order too! Can sit and "people watch" ALL those Walmart Shoppers while you have lunch. "Who  Knows" some of them could potentially even end up on those classic pictures posted on- line called : " PEOPLE OF WALMART"..HeeHee I finished up my meal (double cheese burger combo with fries & a drink) & did some shopping. Picked up a few things I needed. Don't think I'll end up in those pics, but "you never know"..LOL Experience was convenient, quick & I had no complaints!

Wow, this is a nice Fry's. Super Center that not only offers everything grocery; but they also have so much more. Seasonal section, clothing, shoes, Starbucks, & a Sushi area. Came in on 2/6/16 about 9:30 AM. Had fresh made sushi made for us as they were just starting to create it & put it out for the day. Ours was prepped and prepared right there. Andy was the sushi chef very quiet, not engaging with us as customers, but we made the best of it & he seemed to know exactly what he was doing in the assembly work. They were delish! Purchased a few other items on sale, grabbed some drinks as we were on the road for travel. If we are ever back in the area we will be sure to stop in.  Huge Super Center- that I wished we had here in Gilbert, Arizona!

Had to asked for condiments & a fortune cookie.  This spot is hidden to for a reason! Won't be back!

Stopped to get gas here this morning. After I filled up - option to get receipt. Machine out of register tape: So it stated to go see cashier..Went in & the cashier said it would be just a few minutes to have the two computer system connect to retrieve the info & obtain my receipt. Took a little longer than expected and the cashier apologized several times, he then offered me a FREE drink as compensation for the wait time. Nice way to handle any situation! Great customer service!

Walked in here last Sunday 10/18 as we were going to upgrade our phones & purchase two more for our children. There was three customers already in the store along with two employees. We weren't greeted, weren't directed to sign in on a " wait list" Nothing!! Assumed they were busy with the other customers? One customer was being helped by the two employees, the other two were walking around browsing ( waiting to be assisted). Another employee walks out from the back and goes over to where the other two staff member were. We didn't realize it took three people to help one customer?!! I overheard the couple that had just walked in prior to us-ask this staff member " How longs the wait?" He claimed 45 mins! "What The?"...They left! I then told my husband and he walks over to the THREE of them & ask the same thing; "How long is the wait?", same associate says  the same thing "45 minutes"...My husband said what he was thinking before:  "I didn't realize it take three employees to handle one customer".! Which in turn the sales associate says:  " Sir, there are three customers ahead of you". Which at this point there was only THAT ONE, cause we ALL walked out the door!!  Worst customer service, they clearly don't care! This reflex in their business & evaluations at this location! Wish we would have read all these Yelp reviews before we went there! Ended up going to the Sprint Store on Market St. which was a much better experience!

Surgery yesterday for our son with Dr. Anikar Chhabra.  Exceptional service, entire staff we dealt with was professional & pleasant. This is a new location which recently opened in February. Very clean, well maintained facility. Such a beautifully designed building with more of a modern touch. Organized process from the pre-op to the out patient process. I was able to stay with my son during the Pre-op treatment, until he had to go into surgery.. During our time there: we went over to the cafeteria. All menu items are listed clearly and are offered Ala Carte. You grab a tray, napkin & silverware: then continue onto the stations that "appeal to your taste"!  I had the open salad bar that has fresh produce and all kinds of toppings for a healthy put together meal. They carry up to six different salad dressing too! When you are finished plating you head up to the cashier where your SALAD is then weighted . Mine was only $4.95.  Tried a Guinness French Onion soup ( since it was St. Patties Day) , it was delicious & only $1.60. Chicken Strips were average, fries crispy & serving amount of French fries were generous for just $1.60 as well. Sandwiches, wraps, deli roasts, buffet bar of many comfort foods a plus! Prices are super reasonable & the food is good! Our check out process after the recoup period went well. The nursing personnel go over ALL medications & post Operative Discharge Instructions along with a packet of all personalized care & treatments. Folder has all the necessary tools for the in home care after you leave the hospital, along with after hour numbers and emergency services. Highly recommend if your needing Orthopedic Surgery to come here! Also, highly recommend this particular Dr. ( although I'm sure they are all great). Dr. Chhabra is also well established @ ASU and with the Sports Athletes who attend the college. He spends one day a week there at his office (usually on Monday's) & that is how were were referred to him. We are extremely satisfied with how our son was cared for. Now, hoping he is finally on a the road to recovery & on the mend!

Ok, has the USP Store changed their shipping policies?  I went to this location today to mail off two packages. Both were weighted on their small counter style metal scale & the sales associate told me that one of them was to heavy to send standard mail. It was a small white Priority Mail envelope ( filled with soft babies items) so I said: "okay""? : thinking they would possibly send it Priority Mail then since it was a US Post Office Priority Envelope? Nope! This employee said it was again to heavy & I said I've never had an issue at any UPS Store sending out any type of package ? Another employee then came up behind him & said "Well, we can't take the US Postal Packages, you'll have to mail that from the Local Post Office". That is two different statements & super confusing!! So, with that I just asked for BOTH  items and told them I would mail them off through the Post Office-without any issues...

We enjoyed our stay here at the Trump three weeks ago. Gorgeous hotel. Clean, Quality Service... Security always on staff and located around the building doing their job and making you feel welcomed & safe. Bell Hop, Concierge, Valets were pleasant and professional. We inquired with the Concierge whom gave us great recommendations on shows, surrounding venues and addition discount offers! Room was huge! Beautiful view and well stocked with towel and supplies. Many shops and other offerings throughout the hotel.   Defiantly had an enjoyable stay and would love to visit again..

Stopped for the first time on Saturday 12/11/15 New to the area & enjoyed our drive into this Historic Chandler seen. Looked even more inviting with the Christmas Lights and Holiday appeal. Justin was our server, professional & attentive. He seemed to be knowledgeable on ALL the draft beers they offer.  BTW- only rating this review based on the beer & service. We didn't eat there, had a meal somewhere else prior that was a little disappointing. We saw what was coming out of the kitchen to tables and wished we would have experienced the food. We will be back for sure!! Started our bar adventure with the Port Sex Panther dark rich beer & the LimeLeaf, was a lighter citrus beer. Both were great. Then had the most popular known tap beer called The Devils IPA, very hoppy tasting (that one, is okay- you have to really enjoy that Hops taste). The Pineapple Wheat was a favorite, served with a slice of pineapple on the rim of the glass. A somewhat sweet finish with hint of pineapple flavor. YUM Enjoyed the atmosphere and the brews, we will come again!

Stopped in for a bite to eat.  New to the area, thought this place was a newer spot, but after reading a few reviews -Seems like this is a struggling strip mall with lots of vacant shops, etc. However, my experience was a little better than others I guess? Ordered a chicken tostada $3.99. Offer a few different options of meat. I got the Chicken. Tostada was a good size for the price, topped with refried  beans, meat, shredded lettuce & cheese.  Salsa bar has 3 different types. Smoked chili mole' ( dark salsa) is the best one with a touch of heat. Also have a mild red (watery/bland) & a green salsa. Hot carrots: way to many small red chilies in it , guess they use those in the marinating process, but should leave those out when presenting/ serving at the station. Fresh sliced chilled cumbers as well. Store was clean, service was good (considering it wasn't busy), but I don't think I would go through the drive thru based on my fellow Yelpers  advise! Generally, ALL Filiberto's have coupon specials-if you didn't bring one with you; ask if you don't receive one "after" your initial purchase. You can take advantage of the coupon(s) on your next visit. *Blue small flier you can post on your frig offering weekly deals. Don't forget to go to ANY of these location for those offers & on TACO TUESDAY $1.19 for any meat styled taco! SOME SITES propose .50 off when you check in with Yelp!

We were seated right away at 8:00 PM when we walked in! Service by Genevieve was wonderful. She was pleasant & very accommodating. Started with the fried pickles w/ ranch, just okay. Got ribeye's & cooked the way we requested. Great job to the cooking staff! Always get with our side "option" the green beans there delicious!  Again all around good experience, all staffed this evening did a great job in running the restaurant well & with the  friendly service we received even better!

Was in on May 18th. Place was super duper busy at 12:30 PM.  Parking lot was "packed with traffic" and I had a hard time getting through the parking lot! There are several Fast Food places tucked in here and not enough room to flow In & Out ( pun intended) to any of these locations. Cluster!!  Anyway, I was mailed a coupon for a FREE burger  so opt'ed to use it before it expired.Got the standard cheeseburger & homemade hand cut French Fries for $1.89.ALL meals are made fresh to order! They will ask ; if you want onion either raw or grilled.  Service was quick and well organized. Clean kitchen and friendly employees. Enjoyed my meal & will plan to go back again during the "off hours" as this roadway is just to jammed up during the lunch rush!

Had lunch here yesterday @ Noon. No wait & we were seated right away! Our server was Christian. He was great. Attentive, professional & accommodated our party extremely well. We were a group of 6 and were sat by the pleasant hostess in a long extended booth that satisfied us all very comfortably.  One of our guests ordered the Asada Street tacos & tried the new Vampire Taco- really good! Their Street Taco's are a "very popular menu item" & with many different offerings in flavors: " that you are bound to try one you'll really like"! I had their lunch special for $9.95. Got the Margarita Pizza which was kinda average in flavor cause I believe they used canned stewed tomatoes instead of fresh, which I didn't really care for! This came with a side salad, it was ok. It had the dressing mixed into it & veggies were chopped up, so it more reminded me of a slaw than a salad. Blue cheese dressing was very good though. Hubby had the BBQ burger with a fried egg on top! Garlic fries are always tasty! Our daughter had the kids meal chicken teriyaki & french fries. One of her favorites. It comes with a side of sauce to dip your chicken chunks in and the fries are always crisp & delicious!   Great experience over all.

Food and service was good here when we had dinner  here on 8/16. However, very disappointing when we were leaving ( about 9:00 PM) to see a man sitting at the bench seats near the entrance with a gigantic blue/ grey pit bull. This dog was NOT a service dog ( no attire stating so). This dog had on a spiked collar and NO LEASH!! Such a big concern for us with our small children- as we had to walk by to leave the restaurant & not to mention the health code violations. I put a call in the manager on duty the next day- Dina who made reference when we spoke: that it could have been a customer that generally comes in with a service dog. I explained to her that this particular dog didn't have any markings as to be a guild type animal.Clearly his owner didn't look like a trainer of that sort either! Dina was to review on their cameras and follow up with me. I have never heard back. I also called their Corp. Office to report this incident & haven't heard from them either? Way to follow up on a very disturbing situation.

First time we've been here.  Amazing menu & service! Brittany was our server, she was attentive and great! Started with the Edamame, presentation nice/ stemmed & salted served with a sweet soy, ginger dipping sauce.  Wings were okay, we've had better. Bar drinks- vodka tonic were made well & worth the price! Shrimp Poboy was wonderful. Had tons of fried shrimp and it was a huge sandwich! Turkey bacon club (wrapped in a flour tortilla) was good. A great addition was on the kids menu: they offer a kids steak bites which was cooked to perdition and our daughter ate it all!  Great menu with lots to offer. We will be back!

Another great evening here.  Had " Date Night" Saturday 9/26/15 Our staff member was Regal. Probably one of the BEST servers we've ever had! Such a joyful personality, above & beyond with a great attitude: Stellar Service .  Busser : Tre's was sweet as ever & came around numerous times to see if we needed any plates cleared.  Wonderful customer service by ALL employees BOTH times we have been in! Tried the Nacho's- really good. Cheesy Queso on it "the BOMB" : the next time we will ask for an "extra" of that! Requested the Carne Asada ( instead of the ground beef) super tasty & with a side of fresh Guacamole a plus! Wings are really perfect. Saucy, buttery , crispy fried chicken wings. Hot sauce is uniquely flavored with a hint of pepper, similar to the Famous NY Buffalo Wings. Taste just the way they should! This is accompanied by homemade crumbled creamy blue cheese dressing  & or a buttermilk ranch dressing too!  Beers on tap & all the sports games going on the many flat screens, makes for an enjoyable evening. Look forward to making this place a regular dinning location & we will request Regal "for sure" the next time we're in!

It is so unfortunate that others have ruined it for your regulars & yelp enthusiasts... Went to dine here "tonight" on our 20th Wedding Anniversary. We have been in numerous times before writing rave reviews & were so looking forward to using our FREE appetizer / dessert coupon we had received from your location one week ago via email. This promotion was valid from today ( our actual Anniversary) & expired on the 22nd of this month! After we placed our order for our appetizer: which was the Calamari, we were told ( when presenting our discount) we couldn't use the emailed version they sent us because it wasn't "printed out" as per the fine print. Our server then said: We've had so many other's abuse the system that they wouldn't be able to honor this emailed promotion- unless it's a "printed copy" ALONG with the email...Be prepared you must have BOTH!! I'm so sorry that I didn't pay more attention to their details or had the time & resources to pay additional $ to have it printed out. "Who does this anymore?,This is so old school," ..Super confusing, unless you know otherwise! So be prepared people!! BTW- Keep in mind that there is NO scan bar to this, which would have made it that much easier & updated to today's technology! Seems to be- that this is more an issue with them accepting it ? Like "excuse(s)".. No option to speak with a manager?. "Who knows" if there was even one on staff? We then just told our server to please bring us our check. We paid for our drinks (2) which was over $14. Completely upset as I expressed this to their hostess on our way out the door.   It wasn't even that busy on a Wednesday night at 7:15 PM and they are worried about a coupon for a FREE appetizer & or dessert? Valued at $9 tops!! We would have spent additional time /& money on meals to cover their cost of this promotional offer they sent to me.. After writing 2 previous positive reviews- Experiencing this & not honoring a membership special they can't keep track of & that I took the time to sign up for : very disappointing!!  Won't be back anytime soon!

Store was clean and inviting. Two employees on staff were pleasant and professional. We visited the store on 8-29 at about 5:30 PM. We got an Oreo Cookie dipped caramel apple. They cut it in pieces for us, so we as a family of five could share.Also, ended up picked out a few other tasty treats! Staff member that served us-wore a glove which was a plus to keep things sanitary.

Stopped in here for the first time yesterday. I was able to find a few used things at a very reasonable price! Couple of articles I picked up were even on sale price, so an additional discount off was taken at the register. Staff is extremely friendly, place is well organized & clean. Came to find out (during my visit) that this site is supported by the Arizona Lutheran Churches, which takes in donations from ALL their local branches. Contributions are then brought to this location to sell for profit. All monies raised is then gifted to charities & causes they aid in. *These organizations are showcased to the right of the doors as you walk in the store.* This whole concept operates solely by volunteers who provide their generous time & services to manage the thrift. I like the way this program works and that it's all for great causes. I support that 100%!! Be back again soon!

All pumps at "every station" had yellow bag tags that said  "out of order" around the Diesel & Premium Unleaded. Our pump the REGULAR Unleaded line didn't even work- put in all our payment info and wouldn't pump gas?Had to cancel the transaction. Carwash was out of service, cashier said something broken & not in operation. With so many issues : won't be back to this location.  Thank goodness I had enough gas to make it to the next gas station; that was in full functioning service!

So-this is a story! I had no appointment and wasn't even considering on stopping in. My daughter and I were shopping at the Goodwill in the same parking lot. We got out to the car, I started it and we're heading out the direction of where Meineke is when we started to smell and we start to see smoke in the front portion of the vehicle. It was apparent a fire was starting. I pulled over right in front of the Meineke shop my daughter and I got out of the car as smoke started to fill the inside . I called the fire dept. and ran into this location to see if they possibly had a fire extinguisher? Three employees came to my aide , they evaluated the situation / as by this point flames were coming from underneath the passenger seat. Bret ( one of the service tech's) jumps in my car and drives it around back where the other staff members has a hose to put out the fire. By the time the fire truck arrived it was under control. Bret was then able to disconnect whatever else  he could under the seat and we were given the okay to drive again. I want to Thank "ALL" the guys on staff yesterday for helping us & handling the situation quickly, so no further damage was done. Bret was amazing & went above and beyond! They didn't charge me for the time it took away from their other business to help.I am thankful for what these guys did and will be a customer of theirs in the future, I know I'll be taken care of.

Shopped here on 8-17 Prices aren't bad, picked up a cute long stylish skirt for $7.50. At JC Penny even on clearance that same skirt was about $13. Could use a little TLC with stock and cleaning to give the location a bit more of an appeal. Will visit again.

Just there at 1:46 PM to pick up a 20 piece of Hot Wings. Although the cashier was pleasant when taking our order- I can say that was the only thing that was good about the experience! When we got up to the window & our food was literally being handed to us " right after" I paid. I knew our meal wasn't going to be fresh. Got home & there was not just wings in the box but also "parts" of deformed chicken wings ( 1/2 bone pieces/ parts with a little meat on them). So, we didn't really have a 20 piece when you count up the pieces & parts!  Temp of food was less than luke warm, could tell product sat awhile under the lamps for sometime.  Wings were extremely small for the $16 plus dollars we spent.  Disappointing : Won't be back!!

Stopped in for the first time on Friday Dec. 11th. Pleasantly greeted right when we walked in! Clean and well organized store with a good selection of merchandise. Carry many well known designer brands for Men & Women. Such as: Micheal Kors, Louis Vuiiton, Hudson, True Religion, Rock Revival & Miss Me Jeans. I was happy to find a few RVCA shirts for my son & a pair of Nike Free Runners. After being rung up for my merchandise:  I was asked if I found everything ok ( I did) but mention to the cashier, that it would be nice to see some other trendy bands like Volcom, Bullhead etc.*Wanted to find Men's Chino Style casual pants, joggers? They only carry jeans! I expressed my hopes that this maybe something to find here in the future?* Offer brand name purses, jewelry & shoes too! Prices are fair, much to choose from along with pleasant sales associates. Really enjoyed browsing at all they carry! Will definitely be back.

Came in about 8:45 PM this evening. Greeted by Mark the owner who was extremely welcoming and pleasant! All yogurt flavors are listed inside the store as well as special features on a board as you walk into the shop.  Little savory samples are offered if you want to try a particular type- prior to purchasing. Great attraction to draw you into that purchase! Tons of creative candy toppings- FUN! Serving cups are done by weight. So, once you pile it up "your damage is done"-$$$.. LOL Our girls had a great time! Request a dry erase  pen ( your choice of color) & you can draw on the walls!! Cool concept! Super clean store, quality customer service! We will visit again....

Came in for the first time Saturday May 5th. It was about 10:00 PM. Walked right into the humidor room so my hubby could pick out & purchase a cigar. They had so many brands from A-Z. My husband ended up choosing a Forbidden brand cigar that was rich and bold in flavor.  The bar area- you can order whiskey, beer, wine & more. Pick the perfect pairing to your stogie! We sat in the outdoor patio area, which was great for me, cause I don't care for being exposed to all that smoke. Staff was approachable, informative, helpful & attentive.  Great atmosphere. Cool place for " the guys" to hang out for a : Guys Night Out, Date Night "night cap" ( Like us) & or after a game to just relax! Prices seemed reasonable for their "standard cigars", but can get pretty pricey depending on your taste! We enjoyed our visit.

Seemed a little busy when I arrived about 3:30 PM.  Went to get in line and an male employee came out from behind the closed door addressing everyone with bulk packages -what they could do with them as another options instead of standing in line.  He told me I should go over to the automated system to weigh, print label, ship & pay for my two packages. I had never used this system nor did he offer any assistance. I had a little trouble & I had to ask for help from another customer walking by. Thank goodness she knew how to use it, was so patient & kind walking me through the steps. By the time I completed this process;  honestly,  I would have been done in line a lot quicker! In the meantime this same man came out several more time yelling at customers who were dropping off packages and putting the items in the drop box. He was telling them- they better have them addressed appropriately and labeled a certain way or they wouldn't be accepted. It seemed to me these customers were regulars dropping off business packaging in bulk and this mail person seemed clearly agitated with the amount of traffic coming through the doors! Found this a little abrupt & rude. There are better ways to filter customers "in and out" and if he would have been "hands on & helpful" it would have made for a more suitable experience.  I get that the post office is busy, but there is NO need to have an unprofessional postal person..

Dined here for the first time on 9/5. We came in about 9:25 PM. Family of 5 : we were seated fairly quickly. Service started off fair, our server was Kaytlyn. Started with the 24 pack of chicken wings- which we thought were pretty good. Able to choose up to 4 sauces. We went with the Chipotle BBQ, Strawberry Hot, Asian Garlic & Reg. Hot. Our favorite was the Strawberry! Main meals were 2) California Clucks, 1 Topper Burger, Kids Meal-sliders, Fish & Chips Platter & a side of soup ( which was suppose to be Broccoli/Cz) prior to our food coming out, our server informed us that the soup was Chicken Noodle, so I opt'ed out of that & asked for a side salad. Was planning to give my fries & slaw to the kids. Kids sliders were over cooked. When our meals arrived : the portion of fries on all 4 other plates for the cost was less than average. My fish platter was suppose to have coleslaw & fries? It only had 3 VERY OVER COOKED pieces of fish, so I assumed that they just gave me the salad as a "sub" item instead of the sides? I was never given any options so-I asked the young man who served us if that were the case & he said yes! Serves lacked on drinks. My husband "2nd" beer never arrived until we were almost done with our meals: but yet in the banquet room more attention was giving (as we noticed their server walk by us numerous times with full drink trays) to the party that we saw indulging in drink after drink &  " shot after shot".  When our bill arrived my fish platter meal was almost $20 after they charged additional costs for a side soup $1.29 ( I never received/ declined ) & an added charge of $3.89 for my "side salad" . The platter alone was $11.89 that came with NO slaw or fries! Rip off!! Complete confusion, brought this to the attention of our waitress and then we discuss these fees with the manager, which in turn she ended up taking off those charges.  Wasn't a great experience, not really a "family feel place" and we won't be back.

Visited this location yesterday, "first time in" as we are from out of state. Noticed they had a good selection of dance apparel & gymnastic apparel. Offering a 20% off discount-some prices did see a little high on things; but good quality. They do have a return policy in place as well. Keep your receipt and yellow card ( they will give you after your purchase) after so many purchases ( can't remember off hand: but think it's approx. 10) you get an additional savings bonus off merchandise. Have them explain it to you! Owners are pleasant & knowledgeable. We were introduced to Sue ( Husband & Wife Team) she was so sweet and kind. BEST customer service we have received in a very long time.  Ended up buying a cute gymnastic t-shirt. Little pricey even with the 20% off but my daughter can enjoy it as a gift from AZ to show all her friends when she gets back home! We will be back to this location again in the future. We will be moving to the Chandler area in a few months. I will be sure to stop back in, brows & say hello to Sue. We left with a hug-

First time in was last night. Surprisingly busy for@ 9:30 PM. Excellent, delicious gelato! Toasted marshmallow taste exactly like the campfire treat. Little rich for my liking, but really good. The Peach & Strawberry Champagne Sorbets were outstanding!! Perfect cool feel on the palate for any occasion & a great indulgence during those hot summer months too! Tried the Frost Bite ( ice creamed filled chocolate covered candy) peanut butter crunch. It was yummy! Staff was pleasant. Can't wait to try more flavors of what they offer. We will be back "for sure"

Who wouldn't want a scoop of Thrify Ice cream?! "Yes, Please"!!! Chocolate Malted Crunch & Mint & Chip- Are the BEST! They offer many other flavors & choices in cones . You can also buy the ice cream by the pint, quart etc.. They carry Hawaiin Shaved Ice & much more. We enjoyed our sweet cold treat on a very HOT day!

Three employees on staff. Pleasant , Good customer service. Sandwiches made right in front or you. Ordered the Triple Cheesesteak. They offer lettuce & tomato I went without. Would have been nice to have green bell pepper cooked along with the grilled onions? That's a better option in my opinion. It does come with three cheeses including provolone & a melted cheese sauce. It was pretty good , but felt a little pricey! Two sandwiches ( steak amounts are pre measured & frozen when placed on the flat top) fries and one drink was $21.00... We discovered the "boom boom" sauce that we requested on the side; it was really tasty & we dipped our sammies in that for additional goodness.

Came in last night about 10:00 PM. Seated right away and our server was Desiree. Took our drink orders and those came to the table fairly quickly. Ordered the new Garlic Fries which had the hot garlic wing sauce with ranch dressing and shredded Parmesan Cheese on top! Really good fries... Got the large traditional wings with Thai Curry ( my favorite), Asian zing ( our kids favorite), Spicy Garlic ( Hubbies favorite) and the Garlic Parmesan (we all like:) Wings came out hot and saucy just the way we like them. We had great service & great food from this location. Was even acknowledged by the on staff manger who came over and asked if everything was ok. Much appreciated!! Have read many of the other reviews regarding complaints about service. Maybe they have taken note? Our experience was good!

Had a Baseball Tourney there this weekend. Fields seem good. Need a little more attention to the bathrooms. Women's restrooms need some TLC. A little more attention should be given to the grounds , lots of trash-but seemed could have been do to all the games going on that weekend. They do provide bleachers for sitting but I recommended to bring your own chairs that clip on to the bleachers. Bring an umbrella or tarp, not many shaded areas to protect you from the sun.

I would " for sure" give them a ZERO.. Worst experience EVER!! When you look up Charity ( name of their business) it's stated ( dictionary meaning): an Organization set up to help those in need.. NOT with this place.. They need to change the name to Lame Towing!! On Friday April 22, I was leaving work on my way home and do to the extreme heat that day; half way home my car over heated, engine got so hot that my car decided to die!  At about 1:45 PM I called my insurance company and since I pay for a service " Roadside Assistance" my insurance company had this business sub contracted in my area. I was told that Charity would send me a confirmation text that they had received the call & they would confirm an arrival time of approx. 3:45 PM. I waited until about 3:00 PM in the 95 degree heat and couldn't handle it much longer!! Top Golf was directly across the way from where my car came to rest, so I started it up and was able to get into the parking lot of Top Golf. I then decided since I still had about 45 minutes to spare; I would go in and get a bite to eat. I called Charity tow and the gal that answered the phone asked me my name three times, the make of my car two times and where I was located a few more times. I don't know if she was hard of hearing or just didn't understand, but it was irritating!! Anyway, I explained that I had moved into the parking lot and when the driver was to arrive- I would meet him out there. I received a confirmation text while enjoying the cool air inside Top Golf that my tow truck was to arrive at 3:45 PM. I finished up my chips & salsa and went to my car about 3:40 PM. I waiting until 4:15 PM and NO Charity Tow truck? I did however, see "A" tow truck hauling a purple PT Cruiser go down the street past Top Golf on the south side, I clearly knew that was not my truck!! While STILL waiting I saw another "empty" tow truck head my way ; only to pass right by me?I assumed that, that was my driver and that he was possibly having to make a u-turn- but "NOPE"!.. So, again I called the company and told that gal, " I believe my driver just passed by?". She ask again for all the details " not once, but twice" and then had the audacity to tell me: "O, no that may have been another one of my drivers on a route, but your service tech is just finishing up a job with a gal & her Van & he should NOW be to you within the hour"...??  By 4:45 PM I decided I would try to start the car ( since it sat for so long & possibly cooled down enough) & by the "Grace of God" it started up and I was able to drive it home!  I cancelled the service via text message and had to also cancel a very important job interview I had schedule that day at 3:00 PM!! Well then "Guess What"? I received a call at 6:45 PM ( almost 5 hours later) and it was the tow truck driver saying he was on his way!! Really?? I told him that I had cancelled the service call at 4:45 PM. "That was that! Unbelievable, I'm glad it wasn't the prime of the summer with this heat a "blazing" and I'm even more glad I wasn't out in the middle of " no where"!! I have reported this information to my insurance company in hopes that they release this company from their business contract,  as it will only bring them more complaints and bad representation.  Would be interesting to see how much of a portion $$ they "claim" to given to charity? - would like to see the stats on that!! This is probably the "tool" they use to rope these insurance companies in; but then turn around & treat "their" clients like we aren't a priority!! What a scam!! Horrible customer service and poorly ran business= many, many terrible reviews!

Service, Staff & Food exceptional!! The lamb burger was the best thing ordered that night. Devoured by a 13 year old girl and she claimed it was the best burger she has ever had! The short ribs are a "featured favorite" and absolutely Devine.. The mashed potatoes- one of the best I've had yet! The ribeye steak all though very pricey, very good. The wings we started with as an appetizer & they were outstanding!! Killer, Killer Food!! This place didn't disappoint and representative of Gordon Ramsey, his brand and his extraordinary cooking. One of his places marked off my "bucket list", but now I only want MORE!!

Currently good gas prices.  Store is clean & they offer a lot of quick "grab and go" items for lunch! Prices are reasonable.  Cashiers are welcoming and friendly.

Stopped in today & had a Carnitas Taco. I will say a little greasy! Salsa station has delicious roasted jalapeños & 4 yummy salsas. They have one that is a creamy texture, possibly mixed with sour cream & very good! They also offer hot carrots & an onion mixture @ the bar too! Best Filiberto's I've been to yet! Clean restaurant, good service, fantastic tasting food @ fair prices. Will be back to try more on their menu!

Just moved to the area and haven't got to visit any local restaurants in the downtown Gilbert area until Saturday 10/10. We came across this location as we were in the mood for some Mexican food.  Fairly busy at about 3:30 in the afternoon which made it seem to us, like it was a pretty popular hang out for the locals. I'd say the atmosphere is like a retro, chic, cool contemporary concept throughout this restaurant. From the style & theme/ to the menu they offer, it's different ( in a really good way). Our server was Breezy, With an adorable flower head band & all: She was pleasant, fun and informative.  We first thought there wasn't much to the menu, that was until we tried the food- WOW!! Happy Hour was going on-so all draft beers by the pitcher were $5 each! Sweet! Complementary chips & salsa made a quick appearance at our table! I ordered the Nacho's as my " main meal" ( no meat) but they do offer chicken or steak at an additional charge). I replaced the avocado & sub'd it for guacamole (extra fee). Crispy fried flour tortillas lightly salted & topped with delicious fixings that included a creamy lime aioli- Amazing! We also ordered a burrito called "the beast" and they give the option to deep fry it: "chimichanga style! "Yes please!! It was killer!" "Lastly"; three tacos that come out on a silver slotted taco rack. Many varieties of meats to choose from. Ordered the braised beef, baja fish & tinga chicken. ALL were incredible! Accompanied by an orange cucumber salad that is extremely unique! A MEMORABLE Dessert: called the "Better than Bettie's, Mexican chocolate brownie plus Cajeta (a creamy warm caramel sauce)  w/ Dulce De Leche ice cream- Deliciously Devine!   Presentation of ALL our meals was not only eye appealing, but the taste "tummy tantalizing"!! LOL.  Service  by the staff was above & beyond. Not only was our waitress good we were always followed up by Jacy: professional & very well informed of product & store knowledge. Bartender was involved by making an appearance @ our table to deliver a pitcher to us! Way to go guys, place is super edgy, fun & fabulous! We will be back soon!

What a cool place! Stopped in for the first time today. I wouldn't have even of known this place existed unless a friend of my daughters referred us here.  Use to be an old target, located in kinda a depressed shopping complex; this gem have been here for about 3 years! The store has just about everything you could imagine. Except for groceries..LOL From Farm Animal Feed, Pet food & treats, live chickens & rabbits.. Trendy clothing brands including Miss Me Brand & even Under Armor. All kinds of housewares, tool and yard supplies, there is truly everything to everyone! Lawnmowers, paint supplies & all a guy needs to replacement & repairs for the home! Ladies: Adorable purses with matching wallets, jewelry, belts, bling sandals, cowboy boots, stylish T's & so much more! Price are great!  I would say the clothing styles: Men's, Women's & Children- are more Ranch / Western wear.. Candy section: wide varieties of unique brands. Children's section of all kind of adorable clothing .    To made in Arizona jellies & jams, including some standout Amish selections. A Dollar area where "everything" is just $1!  The staff was beyond helpful, super friend & it was a really nice pleasant experience. I ended up purchasing some clearance items: solar gazing ball, stand & two smaller solar lights- ALL for about $40!!  We will be back again really soon. You'll have to stop in and see for yourself all the amazing items this place has to offer!

After walking out of the Sprint Store on Gilbert Rd, we came here for assistance on 10/18. Much better experience! Retail Sales Consultant Samuel C. was professional in his customer service.  We upgraded two phones and purchased two more on our plan. Spent a few hours in-store getting this done. Samuel was patient & accommodating knowing the issue we had at the other Sprint Store! Friendlier staff here and much more helpful!

Visited this location yesterday. Found a few things & prices are reasonable. Much variety of the clothing section to chose from. Store could use a little upkeep and cleaning, but other than that not to bad.

Stopped in on 11/14 to have a beer while out shopping. It was about 3:30 PM in the afternoon.  It happened to be my birthday & so they treated me to my first beer. Had a blonde bock beer recommended by our sweet waitress. It was really light and refreshing! Our server was wonderful & attentive, great personality! She also suggested the nacho tater tots, they were dangerous delish! Cheesy goodness smoothed on top of these tatters is made with their own ale beer! Also had the golden ale shrimp appetizer it was lightly battered & topped with a lime aioli sauce! Suggest you try out both! We were able to "sample" a few other brews & look forward to returning. Can't wait to try other beers along with their suggested pairings of food.  Fun atmosphere, cool place- check it out for yourselves!

Dined here on 6/21 about 6:30 PM for Father's Day. Seated quickly & our server was Robert.. Wanted to try the new Moroccan Spice. They had it in stock ( yea) so we tried a sample batch of those- they were very chili powder tasting- just okay :wouldn't order again. We got our usual flavors as a Family Order along with 2 orders of fries. All was hot , fresh & good.  We were visited by the manager while dinning. She came over and spoke with us- extremely friendly & professional.  Service was good, Robert made sure our glasses were always full & checked on us often. We enjoy eating at Buffalo Wild Wings! We were pleased with the service and staff at this location and enjoyed our experience.

Happy Hour Special During the time we were in- Half Price Soda ONLY from 2-5 PM  We decided to try the "Baby Size" Root Beer Float Shaved Ice  called Sno (their spelling) super light & creamy, so good...  At Least 3 pleasant employees on staff to accommodate the many customers. A plus- they also have a drive thru. Theme inside the shop is Sea and Surf. Hanging above the Windows are Straw Canapés with Lights surrounding all the outer tables inside the dining room. Nice atmosphere.  You can grab a board game to play as you seat and enjoy your sweet treat. They have a ring toss game outdoors on the patio. Fun!! We will be back to explore more options and flavors they offer on their menu. Neat place to pick up a "chill drink" during those extremely hot summer days!

This place is impressive! Restaurant bulk at it's finest. They have everything you need from food, to catering, to restaurant supplies & more! Best deals are early AM for mark downs on merchandise, so if you swing by without delay;  you'll get the best clearance deals! There are only a few of these unique locations throughout the US; 3 I believe (?) & we are fortunate enough to have one right here in Arizona. Picked up a few things today that were comparable in price to the "other" wholesale stores & the brands they carry.. Plan to be back in very soon with our party planning & event next weekend; it's here we have decided -we'll pick up our products. Great Store, Great Prices & Great Concept! Check it out!

I would give a ZERO if offered.. So, we are visiting the area and while here saw the Plato's Closet. We are staying in Mesa, but we were out that way yesterday & decided to stop in. Looked like they had nice displays set up in the window & were well stocked as well as open for business. Right when we walk in there: there were two young girls at the front counter ( one was folding a scarf, while the other was just sitting there) . As we came in- the one employee says to us ( instead of greeting us) " Have you been here before", I said " not to this location" & she says " Well, just to let you know we are only taking in consignment ( buying) clothing and so NON of the merchandise on the floor is available to sell right now? WHAT?? SMH.. My response was "okay, well I guess we're leaving then"... Why is this place even open for business?. No where does it say we are open, but you can't shop or buy: we are JUST BUYING!! They have a HUGE sign on the front roof top hanging down that says " now hiring"?.. This place should rethink their whole idea before they OPEN their doors. I've never experienced anything like this!! On our way out "leaving" I said to the girl " you should open when your REALLY OPEN".  I've been in retail for over 20 years, this was shocking & super rude. I was with my three kids and was embarrassed for us ALL as we had to turn right around to walk out.  How can a place like this even make money, if they are ONLY taking in merchandise: but not offering to sell it? They in turn; pay employees to send people out the door! Maybe that's why they moved & have so many bad reviews.

Had lunch here last week.  Again, check this place out if you haven't already. It's such great Mexican Food. I'm a HUGE fan of the rolled tacos (still could use a little more meat in them). So reminds me of a place I use to have them when I was little! Brings back tons of memories in each crunchy bite! LOL The Carne Asada Burrtio is really flavorful, the meat is marinated just right & is really tasty! Customer service is average. It's a little pricey, but well worth the cost for the experience. A big plus ( in my book) FRESH Guacamole!! It's superb..  Note: each day of the week they offer a special. When I was in on Thursday the offer was if you purchased a combo meal ( with rice and beans) you got a free drink. Generally, these daily deals are located on a board out front as you walk in!

First time in was Halloween Night. Started off at the bar & had a few drinks. Ended up golfing in a bay on the third floor. You purchase member cards/ scan to set up each member. Drivers available to use, monitor keeps track of scores. $45 an hour in the evenings. $35 in the afternoon and mornings are $25. I don't recommended to bring children in the evenings , save that for the daytime with the whole family- you'll have a Blast. Different atmosphere here at night..Night Life/ Date Night- Perfect.*Music was a little louder than my liking. Super, super fun experience, really cool concept.  Service was great, attentive employees in an environment you can clearly see they like to be! Heard only great things about the food here. Wings, Burgers & Chicken sliders are on the top of the list. Great menu with plenty of options! Can't wait to go back!!

Had dinner here for the first time last night. Sat in the bar area. Our server was Mo, she was professional, knowledgeable & attentive. Pleasant staff which also included two young men who delivered our food & bussed the surrounding tables.  We started with the 24 count wings. Offered up to three flavors. Did the Asian Sesame, BBQ & Hot. These wings are quality size. Superb. Seem to have a light batter on them, generously sauced & cooked to perfection! Crispy & tasty. Our favorite was the Hot, Asian were really good too! Tried the Mushi, Top Golfs signature dish & well known for this delight. It's like a burrito and sushi united into one! Really unique and a must have here! Kids meal ( burger) comes with a ton of fries, well worth the $6.  Recommend if you get a salad to try the Champagne Vinaigrette.  The flatbread, highly suggest! Thin, savory dough shaped into a large rectangal with the classic toppings added. Cut into 8 slices of mouthwatering pieces. Had the Pepperoni & Sausage, next time I plan to try the Prosciutto, Artichoke & Olive! Fabulous Food, Stellar Service & A Fantastic Fun Atmosphere.. Not surprised that this place is always packed. Note: the music was still louder than our liking...have seen other reviews with the same complaint. Please turn it down a notch!!

Having to come over to this location from Dignity Health is kind of a bother. It is a completely separate location you have to drive to and if you have to go to & from on same day- it can be an inconvenience. Have been here two times in the last four months. Once with my daughter & once with my son for X-rays. The process if fairly easy: if there is no wait.  Office receptionists average in explanation ( if given) & not much to a greeting or personality when checking you in. You'll have to have your paperwork ready & insurance info in hand. Prices will vary depending on your insurance. Staff tries to get you in and out quickly. We have had the same young blonde assistant both times we've been in, she is pleasant.  X-ray room organized, clean and sanitary. Believe they have several dressing rooms in back if needed depending on what type of X-rays are required.  There is a small (darkrooms) where the still framed X-ray images will appear on a computer after they are taken after the push of a bottom. I believe the whole area is set up is what they call a shielding design, so that the patients (when not being examined) the X Ray department staff, visitors and the public or any persons working adjacent to or near the X Ray facility are protected from any and all radiation. I was able to stay with each of my children during their visits on the other side of the darkroom. It made myself and my kids feel more comfortable and knowing as well ; that I wasn't exposed while with them made it a more comforting experience for us all.

Authentic Mexican Food. Fresh Cooked to order. Restaurant is clean. Carne Asada Taco was good. Asked if I wanted fresh quac & pico, " of course"! Nice salsa bar with three different salsas: Mild (green), regular Hot & Fire ( not a lot of flavor just a lot of heat). Carrots are pickled and tasty and the also offer an onion relish. Price are very reasonable. Will be back to try more of their menu.
