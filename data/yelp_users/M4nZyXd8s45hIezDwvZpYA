The owner and staff is are super attentive and we love going here for date night.  Sushi is always fresh and so packed full of flavor.  Nice smaller restaurant and great location close to home.  Highly recommend it!

This place was off the hook incredible!  I took my college student here for breakfast.  We were warmly greeted and the gal behind the counter was so helpful.  The decor was fun, vibrant, hip and very classy clean.  My daughter ordered French toast that was to die for.  I ordered a basic egg, toast and potatoes and the entire breakfast was off the hook amazing.  Definitely going back and next time I am ordering French toast and ordering cinnamon rolls to go!  Definitely a must go to place to eat :-)

Treated so horribly when I asked to speak with a manager after hong was so rude, had cut me and then been super rough with my manicure after giving a horrible pedicure.    Horrible service and I loved coming here so bummed!

My husband and I went for a date night here last night and loved the ambience, from the lighting to the aroma of yummy food.  My husband was able to call ahead to make reservations and we were immediately seated after walking in for our 5:30pm reservation.    We had Chris for our waiter who was very nice.  I had asked about a merlot to try and after tasting I wanted a more "smoky" wine.  Chris was very nice but not very wine knowledgeable so I asked if he could ck with the bartender.  We were very impressed to have the bar tender come over to our table and personally talk with us.  They didn't offer a smoky flavored wine by the glass but offered a bottle.  I just wanted a single glass of wine so I chose to have a different drink.  He then asked if we were locals and what wine we were looking for.  I told him yes and a favorite red wine of mine is called "Pazo". He said he would add it to their lists of wine to order as they would be offering over 100 plus wines in the near future.  We ordered the spinach and chips appetizer and it was perfect portion as well as super fresh and delectably delightful starter to our meal.  We then had a house salad and a Cesar salad and enjoyed both, perfect portions and fresh, crisp lettuce and veggies.  My husband ordered pesto salmon with Brussels sprouts and it was melt in your mouth wonderful.    I ordered the filet and a baked potato that was extremely tender and had an aromatic flavoring with the maple butter flavoring.  We finished our enjoyable meal with a lemon creme brûlée and it was off the hook with a twist of lemon flavor.  We will definitely be back to Chop as it was a great experience with a fun, romantic atmosphere.  My husband made mention he loved the wall behind the bar.  The wall was floor to ceiling shelves with alcohol bottles and sheer lighting behind setting the perfect mood for a date night.  Enjoy, we highly recommend!
