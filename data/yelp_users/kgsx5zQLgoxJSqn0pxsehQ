Just started home brewing last September and the guys here at What Ale's Ya made the process super simple and easy. Chuck walked me through every step and put it out in terms that even the simplest of minds can understand such as myself. As I have slowly progressed in this new hobby they have still been there with advice to help me improve recipes and also for equipment to start going all-grain and kegging.

I have been coming here for 20 plus years no joke! I love everything about this place especially the wings. The happy hour specials here are the best you can find and they often have free pizza with purchase of a drink in the later afternoon. This place is Right were you wanna be with a large group of friends having a drink and a daily special of wings and pizza!

Been coming to Four Peaks now for a few years and I have always had excellent service, Awesome food, and the beer is about some of the best microbrew in the state! definitely give the Hop Knot a try!

Just started going here with my wife again after a bit of a hiatus. The staff is super friendly here specifically Guard thanks for all your tips! Fun routes, nice hight, and great bouldering! My only problem with the place is the hours of operation. I clearly understand why they are only open from 3 pm to 10 pm on weekdays but as a night shift worker it makes it hard to go as regularly as I would like. But all around just a great place to have fun and blow off some stress!

Really had my hopes up for this place and was super disappointed. Went with my wife and got seated at the bar area; sat there for at least 10 mins before anyone even acknowledged our existence. After placing just a drink order for two beers waited another 15 minutes to get those. The sushi was very mediocre and have had much better. After getting about halfway through our first roll another waitress came over with menus and place settings asking us what we would like to order for drinks somehow she missed we had already been there an hour and was trying to reserve us...That was a first in my book. Just poor poor service at this place.

Swung into Joeys the other day to grab something quick while I was killing some time. Noticed right when I walked in their special of a chicago dog, fries, and a drink for 4.99 and gave it a whirl. It was awesome! great dog loved all the fixings! They gave a decent amount of fries that were good and the topper was that they had malt vinegar for them! The service was great everyone was really friendly and fast. Will definitely be back!

Clean, No Lines, and Alcohol! It doesn't get any better than this to go see a movie. Obviously a bit more pricey than going to the regular movies but for what you get it is worth it. Comfortable leather chair with a table ordered a bucket of coronas and sat back and relaxed.Perfect place for a date with the wifey. Reverse happy hour on Thursday and ladies night just as an fyi.

Was out on my day off and happened to drive by this wonderful new brewery in Phoenix and sure lucky I did!!! The Brew master was super cool and gave me a tour of the brewery and a ton of information that was great for a small home brewer like myself. Then got to sample some of their exceptional brew. I really liked there IPA! If you are ever in the neighborhood I highly recommend stopping in!!!
