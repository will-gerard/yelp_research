This morning was my second experience at Hillside Spot. Both experiences have been mediocre at best. The first trip we attempted to order the Croque Madame as it comes and veg style. To our dismay we could not get the dish veg style because it comes completely pre-made w/ ham. For a spot that seemingly tales pride in specialty, local and quality, one would think their signature item would be made fresh to order.   The second visit consisted of below par juevos rancheros w/ soggy "country potatoes".  Let me clarify, country potatoes are supposed to be diced potatoes usually fried or baked w/ butter or oil. These were hash browns and nothing more...  Lastly, the wait staff was dull and uninviting. There didn't seem to be any communication between the staff whatsoever. The table in front of us sat in different stages of dirty for the better part of 15 minutes while every server/busser passed by, glancing each time.   The space itself is lovely. Reclaimed wood, lots of sun, and calming colors. This is a place I may come back to just have an early morning coffee and work, although the coffee is nothing to write home about.  Oh, and on the way out several staff directly looked at us and didn't see us off... I mean I understand if you are busy but they were far from it.

Worst Breakfast I've probably ever had.  I've always been skeptical of places that also cater, but this place had 'charm' from the outside. Also had some friends RAVE about the hollandaise sauce so I thought I would give it a try.  Took the kids for a late breakfast.   The service was quick and very friendly so a plus there.  The restaurant itself is small, and the only 2 clients inside were about 95 years old sitting side by side facing the rest of the restaurant. Basically you couldn't sit anywhere without their eyes being on you. Granted that's not the owners fault, but still weird.  I ordered the SW Eggs Benedict. It came with a side of "home fries"  The Benedict itself consisted of an old and dry biscuit, beneath what used to be a frozen puck of chorizo (now completely dry and flavorless) topped by a rather bland hollandaise.   That wasn't even the worst part...  The "potatoes" we're green, and mushy. Home fries are supposed to be chopped potatoes of the potato color with a delightfully crispy outside. They were clearly boiled and then maybe attempted to be pan fried?  More about green potatoes: www.nytimes.com/2007/07/03/health/nutrition/03real.html?_r=0  My daughter ordered pancakes. Pretty sure they were biscuick, though I have no proof so it may or may not be so. Either way they weren't the best, or the worst.  Lastly, the music.  They were listening to a Christian radio station. It was blatant. I couldn't handle it, I'm sure others will disagree and that's fine. Everyone has the right to their religion and to go where they please.  These are just the reasons I won't go back here with my family.

EPIC culinary adventure.  I recently heard about ShinBay from an out of town friend. She presented the restaurant as an exclusive Japanese experience with incredible food, basically the place you want to try at least once in your life.  Since the website is meek and doesn't say a whole lot about the experience, I decided to pop by while I was in the neighborhood to hopefully land a seat after my meeting.  Of course, on a Friday night they were booked SOLID and about to start service. I chatted with the host about how ShinBay works, the food options I could expect and the overall process. I let him know my wife was vegetarian, to make sure she had options available - so he showed me the beautiful photos of the dishes readily available via iPad.  I ended up booking a reservation for Sunday evening (lucky for the availability)   SO excited to try it out we showed up on time and were given a seat at the Chef's counter. Awesome view. I highly recommend sitting here if it's your first time in. The entire process is meticulous and perfect, like a Japanese ballet of food.  After being welcomed by the host like old friends, my wife asked me how I knew him.  She was obviously surprised when I explained we just met on Friday...  The entire staff was the same way. Attentive and friendly they made the whole experience event better.  The food was perfect. All of the flavor combinations were so complimentary. The Washugyu beef was beyond amazing and of course the Nigiri was the icing on the cake.  Of course this place cost a pretty penny, but I would definitely visit again and again for an incredible experience.  ++++++

Meh. Lot of hype around this place, but I was underwhelmed with the food.   The decor is really nice, and a great location but overall I wouldn't come back except for their extensive beer on tap.  I ordered:  Squid Salad - not bad, not great. Sake Nigiri - salmon was not fresh too much rice Spicy Tuna Roll - tuna mix wasn't fresh and zero flavor  To top it all I asked for Nigori Sake. The server didn't know what it was since apparently they only have WARM sake. Not much of a Japanese restaurant.
