I grew up and spent most of my life in tempe, and have passed by this location many times always thought about going in. My first time, was horrible. It was a tuesday and really slow. We sat outside. Our server took for ever to bring us our drinks and completely forgot my beer. I cancelled my beer and figured id just order it from the bartender. When I go to the bar, no one is bartending (hmmm wondrer if thats why drinks took forever). Find out my outside server is actually the bartender! Shes supposed to handle the drinks for the entire restaurant and take on outside tables? Just horrible, when we ordered our food, we waited 45 minutes before we decided to jist cancel the order. Management looked confused and did nothing to help besides offering to comp our food. I don't want free food, I just want food. Worst experience ive hlever had, and will not ever be giving Joe's crab shack another try. How has the place been there so long?

Sign says "Barbershop" even says "walk-ins welcome" I show up at 5pm and the only way I'd get a haircut is if someone canceled. Umm that sounds like an appointment only type a spot. Should change to name to "Salon for men".

You want a new neighborhood bar, Flanny's is the place for you. The verity of beers on tap, in bottles, and cans is just great! They have just about any kind for whatever mood you're in. The Staff as well as owner (John J. Flanagan) are friendly and ask questions to guest on how they can adapt to accommodate their surrounding neighborhood. As for food, I am a huge wing fan, I've had crap wings and I've had good wings. I've had the wings at Flanny's about 6 our of the 7 times I've been there. How do you think i rate them? I've also had the chicken strips which were not the greatest, still weren't bad. They also do sandwiches and burgers which I'll have to try when I choose to pass up the wings. Now the good stuff, the beer! This place has quite the selection from sleepy dog on draft and $2 16oz pabst blue ribbon cans. I also never had moose drool in a can, and they had it, so i had to try it.  I give it 2 thumbs way up if you're looking for a nice local place to hang out, eat, drink, watch the game, or play Golden Tee and silver strike.

I have read the reviews and the ones that are bad are just plain stupid. If you know how restaurants work and are not a complete pompous jerk. You'd find this place awesome! I stumbled upon it by accident and live right by. I came in for lunch the first time and sat at the bar. Bartender was friendly and food was great! I really like the atmosphere and open area. If you have a clue and understand the bar tables are part of host seating and not open you'd get why they may be open. I've tried the prime rib dip and the chicken caesar. Both were above average than most places. I'm not rich but I'm also not a cheapskate. I found the pricing more than appropriate. As for the birds. If you don't like birds.... Don't go to a place called "the perch". I'm indifferent about birds but birds are animals and they poop pee and squawk. You know, cause they're birds! I love this place and like the simple menu, and relaxing garden feel

Didn't know if I'd be excited having this place opening right on the corner from my house but came in tonight for the first time. Food was amazing. I've been to places where their beef was stringy, chewy, and so much oil it upset my stomach. This place was nothing like that! Tasted great and supper excited to try out more of the menu. This place is new but I hope they keep the standers for their food for years to come!
