I am a big fan of Eggs Benedict and when I saw the pictures online (not how it looks in person anymore)  and read the menu I thought I had found a new favorite.  Not the case. The muffin was soggy (even though I asked it to be more toasted) They changed out the ham for prosciutto which made it way to salty.  There was very little Hollandaise sauce.  My server didn't really seem to care about my experience either.  On the bright side the monkey pancake was awesome.   Maybe next time I will just focus on the pancakes, french toast, or eggs and hope to have a better experience.  The monkey pancake was good enough to get me to come back and try the bananas foster french toast.

I called Ann as a new client and she went out of her way to fit me in with my time constraints.   I was so happy that I met her. I needed my eyebrows waxed and I am really particular about it.  SHE DID AMAZING!!  I will be going back and will recommend her to all my friends. Her price is awesome too.  ONLY $15 and the first waxing is FREE!!!  An added note, I have sensitive skin and the wax she uses was actually the best for my skin and did not irritate it.    Definitely go see her.  From a dude's perspective she is cool and gets you in and out. From a girl's perspective she really listens to exactly how you want them done and gives it to you.  The quality is great!  Cheers!

I heard about this place and it went above and beyond anything I could have imagined. Great people working, the owner Jeff is a cool cat and you can tell his love comes out in his food.   Got the breakfast crepe burrito and it was out of this world!!!  I am going to make this a regular stop!  You gotta come check it out.
