They have some of the dumbest, laziest, unprofessional  people at this location. I am so fed up and I will never return to this location!!!! Every single time I have ever went there or even a friend or family member they have gotten our orders WRONG! My son is allergic to cheese you jackasses and he came close to eating one of your fucked up orders!!!! Come on you can't even get a kids meal right??? Your food is NEVER fresh, and when I ask for it to be made fresh you give me problems. Your machines are always broken! What a bunch of lazy, careless scum bags, hope you choke on a fry!

Dont get me wrong this place has their good & bad days depending on who you get and what you are getting. And I've only been happy with one persons work in there, everyone else was (untalented) im sorry to have to say and I've been handed a nail file before because they didn't know how to shape a pointy nail the right way. But I can only say I've been happy with my nails twice here and thats only when I pay $50 and up for my set of nails. You get what you pay for at this place if your not willing to pay the scottsdale price your going to walk out of there with something you HATE! Now on to my toe nails, Ive gotten gel before and I walked out with cuts by my toe nails because how rough they are with the file. They are not gentle and rush to get people in and out. Most of the people working here dont care about the quality of their work, and trust me it shows, I have had my fair share of bad experiences here! And I continued to go here hoping I would get the same person that did great work and the convenience of how close it is to me. Since I cant manage to remember her name I apologize I can't say who, but for the gentleman working in the front I give him a thumbs up for his AMAZING customer service. Very friendly thankyou for that!

They do an amazing job on my nails, I always leave happy and they do a better job then any nail salon in AZ that I've been to so far, which is A LOT.  They make great suggestions and have a sense of taste unlike other nail salons where they don't care if it makes the customer unhappy.

I LOVE THIS PLACE! This little family owned sushi restaurant is the best I've been to in Arizona. I go here EVERY year for my birthday and my familys birthday's. They are so sweet and friendly, and make the most amazing sushi and soups and etc., you will ever try. So fresh and full of flavor, you can never go wrong no matter what you order. There is NEVER a wait its great especially if your hungry...you'll be rolling out once your done with this place ! :)

Ghetto. Dirty. Didn't have any soda because machine was broken so we had to get soda out a bottle. Sandwich looked like it was sat on. French fries COLD! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE, oh and they where out of bbq sauce. Keep in mind it's 5pm and they are out of everything. No discount NOTHING!

Let me just start by saying everyone is SOOOO nice! And the place is pretty cute, sets the mood for a fun date or just to meet up with friends.   Parking is a little rough since its so small and you have to park in the back or side of building.   Food... well it was my first time there and I seemed to be the first to order their new menu item 'the glazed shrimp in veggies with a side of clear noodles' and MY TASTE BUDS WENT WILD! So yummy, I was soo full but I just couldn't stop eating it! And might I mention it was a huge dish now I understand why it was $15. Still very pricey though but the taste made up for it.   I will be going back very soon, don't be afraid to try something new, I did and I loved it!
