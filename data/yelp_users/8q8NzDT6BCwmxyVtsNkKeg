When I first saw the menu, I wasn't sure if this place was going to live up to the hype.  It appears that they pretty much just have a handful of appetizers and a few different panini's and bruchetta.    Wow, was I mistaken!  This place definately lives up to the hype.  The artichoke dip and hummus were like the best I've ever had.  The wait staff was very friendly, helpful and prompt with everything.  This would be a great place to kick back with some friends, have a few drinks and enjoy some amazing food.

You simply have got to love Lee Lee's.  Let me sum it up for you.  You walk out of Lee Lee's with a cart full of grub....  You spend maybe $40.  You walk out of Whole Foods with a cart full of grub....  You spend upwards of $200.  I love Whole Foods and I shop there, but now I cry when I leave there thinking of how much money I could have saved at Lee Lee.

All you have to do is read a bunch of the reviews and you will see that Lifetime Fitness is the real deal.  I mean, they have everything you could possibly imagine in a gym and more.  They have state of the art equipment, an indoor pool, an outdoor pool, a cafe, a bistro, a salon, sauna, steam rooms, childs center, etc., etc., etc.  Trust me, it's all here and then some.  BUT...  what really gets me is that they do not do well with the little things.  Little things like toilet paper.  I mean, is there anything worse than rushing to the toilet, doing your business and then finding there is no toilet paper!  This hasn't happened once.  It happens frequently.  Now, it's the first thing I check.  Anyway, it doesn't stop there.  Many of the locker doors are like falling off the hinges.  The steam room is routinely broken and not functional.  I'm telling you it's little stuff.  For example, the clock outside the sauna was broken.  Shit happens right.  It took them a month to replace it?  We're talking about a wall clock and it's kinda important to have one in a sauna.    This place really rocks it out in so many ways.  It really does.  The cafe is just awesome.  But somebody there in management really needs to take a close look at the little things.

As an avid golfer, I play a lot of the courses in the Cave Creek area. I recently took my friend to Dove Valley to play golf for his birthday. It was a busy day and we got paired up with another twosome. The two guys we got paired up were from Canada and didn't have a good understanding of desert rules and they slowed us down a bit. That said, we never had the group behind us hitting up on us.   On the 11th hole, the Ranger started to push us and said we were 2 holes behind the group ahead of us. I spoke to the Canadians and asked them to just drop if they lost a ball to we could pick up the pace.  They agreed.   The Ranger continued to follow us and harass us for being too slow. Twice, he stood with us on our tee box and said he needed to move us along, yet never really told us what we needed to do?  He literally parked his cart in one of the fairways while we were teeing off! After the 14th hole, the Canadians were so angry that they dropped out and stopped playing. As my friend and I pulled up to 15, there was a foursome on the green so we couldn't tee off if we wanted too.    There are other nice courses in the area like Rancho Ma√±ana and Legend Trail where the Rangers may respectfully ask you to pick up the pace but never treat golfers like we were treated at Dove Valley.

Just had lunch at Green with Brady K.  Given the fact that this is a vegetarian restaurant, they don't serve meat. (No shit, right!)  Anyway, I was absolutely amazed at how this place prepares food like chicken wings that aren't really chicken.  Brady K. had the green burger and he loved it.  I had the BBQ Po-Boy and it was awesome.  I'm still trying to figure out what was in this sandwich.  It looked like pork.  It tasted like pork.  But it wasn't pork!  This is killing me!  The pasta salad on the side was also really good with just the right amout of curry seasoning.  If all vegetarian food was this good, we'd see a lot more vegetarians and lot less spare tires.

Tonto Bar & Grill is always a great place to grab a drink and some appetizers after a round of golf.  It's also a great place for lunch and dinner.  I can't say I've ever had a bad meal or bad experience here.  I also can't say I've ever been "wowed" here either.  Overall, it's just a really great place to relax and have a few drinks or a great meal.

Alberto's is definitely a hidden gem in Cave Creek.  Their pizza was one of the best I have ever eaten.  Their pasta and meat balls were also to die for.  Alberto is from Rome and he knows Italian cuisine.  If you're looking for glamour and glitz, this is not the place.  If you want to have some amazing Italian cuisine at a restaurant that feels more like grandma's place in the country, then this is the place to go.

I love Legend Trail for a lot of reasons.  It starts at the top with management.  They always have it together and they understand customer service.  You can always expect to get treated with respect from everyone there.  The practice facility is really great.  There is a large short game area with four greens and a really nice driving range.  Practice balls are always included so be sure to show up early.  As many people have mentioned, the course isn't all that tough, but if you don't play smart, it can eat your lunch in some areas.    Also, if you play as a single, there are a lot of members and regulars that play here.  It's always been a delightful experience when getting paired up at Legend Trail.

Normally the words "sushi" and "buffet" together make me want to run to the bathroom and hurl.  Not the case with Makino.  I've eaten here a few times in the past few months and the quality of the food is excellent.  The sushi is always very fresh.  They have the best soy sauce.  They add some crushed red peppers and it gives it just a little kick.  All of the hot food is gourmet quality.  I haven't tried the desserts but they look great.  This has to be one of the best sushi buffet restaurants in Las Vegas, if not the western USA.

When it comes to insurance options, Alex and Summer are as knowledgeable and experienced as you'll find in Nevada.  They will take the time to make sure that you are educated about your options so that you will understand exactly how much coverage you should carry and why you need it.  There are a lot of choices out there when it comes to insurance, but if you are looking for a personal touch and expertise in the industry to back it up, Alex and Summer will make sure you are covered.

This place is the ultimate diet killer!  All I can say is that the food here is different and it's awesome.  You simply have to experience it for yourself.  I've only eaten here twice because I am limiting myself to once a month.  I actually schedule eating at this place in my phone.  It's that good!

Mirabel is absolutely five star all the way.  They have a fantastic golf facility.  Not only is the clubhouse and golf course top notch, it's the people that work there that create an experience you won't find anywhere else in the area.  The golf pro, David Engram, is one of the nicest and most knowledgeable guys you'll find in this business.  He and his staff are always friendly and make you feel like you're someone special.

What an awesome find! My doctor recommended this place as he said their pizza is better than Bianca. I had to try for myself after he made a bold statement like that. I had their pizza by the slice that they sell for lunch and it was outstanding.   I also grabbed a few things to go as well. This is a family owned and operated business. Great food and a very authentic "Italian" feel. Mamma Mia!

Living in Cave Creek, I have access to 8 golf courses within 15 minutes of my home.  Most of the golf courses in this area are very nice, but The Boulders is the clear winner in many way.  First of all, they provide great service in the golf shop and around the course.  The practice range is also very nice and always well kept.  The courses themselves are both fairly challenging and absolutely stunning aesthetically.  When playing the front nine on the south course, you'll think you just played the nicest hole ever and then the next hole is even more breath taking.  Bottom line, if you're in this area and playing golf, you have to hit make The Boulders part of your golf trip.

I took my kids to Crackers & Company for breakfast.  We had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated on a Saturday morning.  It was well worth the wait.  The California Benny is really good.  They serve fresh cut fried potatoes, not frozen hash browns like most places.  The kids had pancakes and those were really good also.  Overall, I'd say this is the best breakfast place I've found in this area.  And, we all ate for under $25.

Having grown up in the midwest near Kansas City, I know a thing or two about barbecue.  I've tried pretty much all of the barbecue joints in the Phoenix area and Bryan's Barbecue is hands down the best you will find in the area.    I have yet to try everything on the menu because the ribs are so good, I can't stop eating them!  It's like I go in with the thought of trying the chicken or the brisket, but somehow I just get sucked into buying a rack of ribs.    So, don't be afraid to drive a little farther north than usual to find the best barbecue in the valley.

What a rip off. I paid $235 for a shaving set that I found on Amazon for $120. Unbelievable.

Should be called Notorious P.U.K.E.   I had some relatives in town and we decided to have dinner in Desert Ridge. We had planned to eat at Yard House and I'm not sure what possessed us to go here.   We ordered the big family feast meal and everything on the platter was just terrible. Not only did the meats have no distinct barbecue flavor, everything on the plate was either cold or room temperature at best. The Texas Toast was cold. Sweet potato fries were cold. The service was so bad that I didn't even get a chance to complain to the waitress. At one point, I went to the bar and grabbed a pitcher of iced tea for refills. There was practically nobody there (which should have been our first clue), yet the service was like nonexistent. We had five adults and two children and of course, they stuck us with an 18% gratuity (party of 6 or more).   There are many great restaurants to chose from at Desert Ridge. Do yourself a big favor and steer clear of this joint.

Always great food at Those Guys Pies. Hands down, the best Philly Cheesesteak in Las Vegas.

Wish is definitely the best new locals spot in Vegas.  If you are tired of Blue Martini, you have to check out Wish!  Everyone there is so friendly.  Jeff (the owner) does a great job of making everyone feel special.  Next time you're thinking of the perfect spot to hit in Vegas, be sure to check out Wish.

I work close to Pellini and would routinely hit Chipotle for lunch on a regular basis.  I LOVE Chipotle but since Pellini opened, I have not been back to Chipotle.  Pellini is basically an Italian version of Chipotle.  Fast, gourmet food done right with healthy eating in mind.    On my first visit, I was greeted by the owner and he gave me a gift card for my lunch.  He was very nice and you can see by the look and cleanliness of the restaurant that he understands how to run a successful operation.  I look forward to seeing more Pellini restaurants opening up soon.

I absolutely LOVE this place. I've tried several items I the menu and have yet to go wrong. Their mahi mahi is always prepared perfectly. It's great to get a little taste of Hawaii out here in the desert.

This place is really great. Authentic Italian food at its finest. The bread here is simply to die for. The pasta is good but anything that's baked in their wood fire oven (including pizza) is fantastic. Be sure to grab a loaf of bread to go as well!

Beautiful restaurant with a nice outdoor dining area. There is also a private dining area as well. I had the bolognese and it was fantastic. My kids had pizza and raved about that as well.
