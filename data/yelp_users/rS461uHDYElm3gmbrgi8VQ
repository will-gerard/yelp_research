Cowboy Ciao has a great selection of American Foods, with the Chopped Salad being a weekly craving of mine.  The wine selection couples well with their menu and the flights are a great way to go if your just stopping in for a night cap.

Food is definitely true to its British nature.  And Irish Car Bombs are a great deal.  The prices are highly affordable a great place after an ASU game or just late at night with lots of friends.

The Living Room has good energy.  The music and the open air feel are only enhanced by the specialty drinks.  This is one of my favorite lounge spots in the SE Valley.

I was here watching the Cardinals Texas 6th Game of the world series.  Great evening of good food and unique margaritas.    Was there the Saturday afternoon before Halloween, just more of the same.  The tacos were great and the margaritas are fairly light so great for the afternoon.    The service was great even in a fairly busy environment.  The beer taps on the table were a favorite of the males around while the late not music kept the place rocking.

After my second dinner at Dominicks I have found I was truly disappointed in the food and more so in the strange aroma that permeates the building.    The positives: The opalescence demonstrated through hard woods, crystal chandeliers, water features is common to high end steak houses.  The negatives: The steaks were mediocre and nothing on the menu has left me "needing" to go back.  Then there is this terrible smell of "feet" that hits you just as you walk into the bar area. Just not acceptable if you want to attract patrons.  It does appear to be a hub for the seniors in our community and with the close of Marco Polo they now have a place to call home.
