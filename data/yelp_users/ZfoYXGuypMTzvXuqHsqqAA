Reminds me a lot of the holes in the wall I used to eat at in Hawaii. Went at the height of lunch hour so the line was out the door but my GF and I didn't mind the wait since the weather outside also reminded me of Hawaii. Food was pretty tasty despite the order being slightly botched, sticky steamed rice was perfect and the service was awesome. Don't like that the drinks aren't self serve but it's a minor nit pick.

Slow, indifferent service, mediocre and somewhat pricey food, decor reminds me of a mental hospital I once spent a 72 hour hold at... my coworker enjoyed her pasta, my sandwich was aight but I won't be going back (Park Central Deli is much more my style anyway).

What can you say, it's a Barnes and Noble. 4 stars as the employees were quite friendly and helpful, not 5 stars as the store was a little dirty (a bit of trash on the floor, magazines on racks somewhat askew). Granted it was an hour before closing and they seemed to be a bit understaffed for the crowd that was in there, but overall a fruitful experience.

I like shopping at Target. No, I LOVE shopping at Target. My wife and I made it an every other day thing when I lived in California (it didn't hurt that the Starbucks inside that Target had the funniest and most competent baristas in Ventura County). The store was clean, employees were helpful and I could easily find what I was looking for.  The Target in Goodyear is possibly the dirtiest, smelliest, most unkempt store I've EVER been in...staffed by some of the most rude and incompetent people I have ever met in my life. Every time I have been in there (always a different time of day, always a different day of the week) the store is a disaster area. Multiple racks of go-backs from the fitting room and carts full of go backs from the register area are always spilling over into the men's and maternity departments. I have never been greeted or even acknowledged by any of the sales floor employees while I shop.  Having been a retail manager for many years, I can understand maybe a rack of go backs once in a while. There is NO EXCUSE to ignore your customers or to maintain a sloppy shopping environment. Absolutely inexcusable and sadly, this is the ONLY Target I've shopped in to have any of these problems at the magnitude at which they are displayed here.

Go late at night, get Marshall (?...skinny, long dark haired kid) as your server and order a big ass cheeseburger. I don't remember the name of it, as it was on a menu insert and not a regular menu item...a cheeeburger with a fried egg, hashbrowns and cheese sauce on it. My God, one of the best cheeseburgers I've ever had.   My friend's food was delicious as well, service was attentive and FAST...it was a packed house and everyone was having a blast.   Having survived many after-club, overflowing and understaffed Denny's during my lifetime this one was a revelation (well, as much of a revelation as a Denny's can be).

Despite the somewhat extravagant price ($12 and change per person!) and indifferent service, my coworker and I were suitably impressed with our sandwiches and the speed at which we were able to obtain them at the height of lunch hour. Bonus points for crushed ice, Cherry Coke and an air conditioned patio.

I wouldn't go so far as to call the place a dive but it is a definite hole in the wall...next to a Circle K on a not so decent stretch of Indian School. Once you get inside though, things change.   Enough of a variety on the menu to satisfy everyone and the prices are very reasonable. I ordered the cold Italian combo as my friend wasn't sure if they still offered half sandwiches (and I didn't have the common sense to ask), and she had the chicken parm. The woman at the counter was busy as hell as it was the middle of lunch hour, juggling the counter orders as well as the incoming phone calls, but she was still very friendly as well as the other younger woman in all black (didn't hurt that she was cute. LOL). Less than $20 for 2 huge sandwiches and 2 "gallon o' drank" sodas.  For how busy it was there was plenty of seating (at your generic plastic patio furniture) and the food came out quick. Mind you I'm a big guy and this sandwich was as long as my forearm and as big around as my upper arm. The meat on my sandwich was of an ample quantity and quality, and the veggies were nice and fresh, particularly the tomatoes which were at a perfect ripeness, and pepperocinis (3 to a plate, a generous amount as they were quite large and juicy).  Like the other reviewer I could not finish my whole sandwich, the same lady that had taken our order and brought our food came at the most convenient time to offer to wrap it for me. It is now in my fridge awaiting a quick death later on.  Now that I am working near here (less than a block away, natch) I'm glad my friend knew about it and showed me, as I wasn't looking forward to McDonald's every day at lunch and there isn't much else in the neighborhood.

Still good food, but evidently the So Cal "transplant" definition of "dive" is a little different than the definition Phoenicians use. My bad.

Being quite afraid of needles and being a big wimp in general these days, I was hesitant to get my labret done (for the third time now)...I hadn't done anything for myself in awhile and decided I wanted my piercing again. After stumbling across the other reviews, and doing a little further research I decided I would trust HTC with it.   My concerns about built up scar tissue and other complications that might arise due to the second shop's very shoddy job the last time were alleviated by Andy, who also performed the work. He went over with me what went wrong last time and what HTC does differently to avoid that. Aside from being very professional and fast (I was in and out in 20 minutes!), I spent less here than I did at the last two places I went. In addition, I also got an education in internally threaded body jewelry as well as the downsides to Scope and Listerine.  Now that I've caught the bug again HTC will definitely be getting more of my business as well as my glowing endorsement to anyone who inquires about my big black mole.

Just went back with a friend from So Cal to get my ears pierced (8 gauge black glass plugs) and get my labret taken back out to 14 gauge. Dana and A.J. are the shit, and I refuse to get any piercings done in So Cal, only here at HTC. You would be well served to visit HTC before anyone else.

Good stuff. Very good portions for the price. Not quite as good as the real thing (lived on O'ahu for three years) but still very good for being 3000 miles from Hawaii. Haven't had a chance to eat at any of the local L&L's (the gold standard IMO) but this was still pretty good.

I do believe now that Ono is superior to L&L. Bigger portions, better quality...and their spam musubi is better than anything I ever had while living in the beautiful 50th state. Ono = win.

Not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but pretty damn close. DEFINITELY the best decor of ANY Mexican place I've ever eaten at, and that's a lot of places. Minus one star as our waiter was on the slow side and not very attentive, especially considering it was not that busy.   Great spot...I will return.

5 stars for service...our waiter on a slow Tuesday afternoon, right after the lunch rush, was a funny guy and pretty good at his job. As well, my friend and I never wanted for refills on our Dr. Pepper, which is the one true way to my heart at any restaurant.  3 stars for the food, which frankly, wasn't all that great but that may have been due to what I ordered more than anything else (Blue Moon burger). To be honest, I've had better cheeseburgers from Denny's (see my review, LOL) but I guess that isn't the draw here...my friend's beef brisket sandwich looked and smelled delicious and there's plenty more  items on the menu to choose from next time.  Of course, I must reiterate that since there isn't much in the way of decent dining in the neighborhood my friend and I work in (she about 5 blocks west, myself about 3), this place will definitely get a second chance not too long from now.

Where do I start...  I hate to compare this one to the one I attended in Southern California, but I don't really have much other basis for comparison.  First off, this one is way more packed at any given time than my previous gym. Can't fault them for that, it means it's a good place to be, right? Meh.  The personal trainers (who if you didn't already know work on commision) are VERY aggressive with their recruiting tactics...I have been accosted on several occasions, bad enough once that I had to cut my workout short and get out of there to end the madness because the gentleman would not take no for an answer. In addition sometimes the front desk workers are more concerned with who's pants they're getting into at the end of the night. Save the MySpace drama for home time, kiddies.  A lot of times, the most random machines will be in disrepair. Treadmills with non-operating heart rate meters or fans, (or worse and a potential hazard/lawsuit) slipping belts, exercise bikes with the same problem with the slipping belts, among other machines.  Sometimes it is very dirty in there. Trash on the main floor mostly but sometimes it appears like the mens sauna and shower areas haven't been scrubbed down for weeks. Also, I don't understand why other LA Fitness locations have shower curtains, yet this one does not? Not that I care but it is a nice touch for people that aren't as comfortable "baring it all."  As stated it really isn't fair to compare this to other local gyms (I will be switching up soon so watch for more reviews) but having been so impressed by the facility and employees of the LA Fitness I attended back in California, this one is a huge letdown.

The best time to shop at this Wally (if not all of them?) 9:00 am on a Tuesday towards the middle of the month.   The absolute WORST time? 6:30 pm on a Friday that happens to fall on the first of the month. So cash your check and come up!

A friend and I recently went on a busy Friday night. The location leaves a little to be desired, in a shabby strip mall, and from the outside doesn't look promising at all. Once you're inside though, it's all good. Considering how busy it was (no empty seats at the bar, no empty tables) the service was attentive, friendly and reasonably fast.   As mentioned by the other reviewer, the glossy menu offers pretty much 50 different variations on the same theme. My friend and I had the New York roll (I think would've been better off as the Arizona roll, it was pretty damn spicy), the Alaska roll (the smoked salmon on top was of good quality, better than I was expecting) and split 2 orders of salmon roe nigiri and 1 order of scallop nigiri. For the price, the nigiri orders were a little on the skimpy side but quality was good. The rolls were also a little on the expensive side, but ours were well made, not stingy with the fish at all and quite tasty.  Overall, not a bad little spot. 4 stars as 3 is not doing them justice, but lacked anything special to put them over the top.

Our waitress was a complete doll. Very friendly and knowledgable about the menu items. I gave 4 stars due to two things. First, although my calamari appetizer was delicious and my gyro pita the same, I don't like finding broken toothpicks in with the cucumber (yes, I had already pulled the other ones out completely). Second, my father's blackened salmon was waaay overcooked. I understand one usually doesn't go to a Greek restaurant to order blackened salmon, but cooking fish is pretty basic. In the restaurant's defense the waitress was extremely apologetic and offered to bring him a new plate, but he declined. I didn't mention my toothpick to her, since otherwise the food was delish.  Still the best Greek food I've had in a long time and I will definitely go back.

Bummer that more of the shops and restaurants aren't open yet, as from the looks of the place it oughta be a decent spot to spend a lazy afternoon with a loved one or friends.  As for the theater itself, I haven't seen a movie in theaters since Star Wars Ep.3 was released (yes, I'm aware that's over 5 years ago) and it was nice to see that ticket and concession prices haven't risen at the rate of gasoline prices. The kids working the ticket booth and concession registers were nice enough although being offered popcorn along with our drinks 3 times was a little excessive.  We went to see Iron Man and it was not even half full which was great. The seats are comfy, the projection and sound systems worked fine, the movie itself was pretty good also. No trash that I could see, the floors weren't sticky with spilled soda or ??? (a nice change of pace), it was a good experience.  After seeing how crowded the Harkins at 99th and McDowell can get (just from the looks of the parking lot) I've decided that this is a better spot to catch a movie if all you're after is the show itself.

Just as good as any of the locations in their home market, with a much cleaner lobby and friendlier employees.   On a busy Memorial Day afternoon I was "In N Out" of the drive thru faster than I ever had been at any of the locations I used to frequent in So Cal.

The most bomb ass rolled tacos and guacamole on the I-10 corridor...my first stop when I'm back in town on my monthly trips to Goodyear to visit family and friends.   As a matter of fact, guess where my current profile pic was taken...what's that I'm stuffing into my fat face?   I say hello to Filiberto's before my own family...how sad. =(

Not as good as my favorite (Anaba) but it will do while I'm in Arizona. As the other reviewers state it is a little pricey but fish is decent quality and they are fairly generous with the portions. My dad's chicken cutlet was overcooked but his plate did come with a lot of food so he was willing to let it go. According to the waitress Tuesday and Wednesday nights are "Dollar Sushi nights" and you can get a full specialty roll for a dollar per piece (so maybe $8 for a roll that would normally cost $12, but you can mix and match from a small list). Me being skeptical of "sale" sushi, I let my mom do the honors and I was pleasantly surprised as it was tasty and appealing to the eye as well.  The hostess and the other nice young lady waiting on us were very friendly and helpful which is not always the case in a Japanese restaurant. There is a lounge area and a full bar which seem fairly inviting...my parents loved the decor and the place seems thoughtfully laid out.   If you're looking for decent sushi out on the far West side, you could do far, far worse.

Don't bother sitting in the general dining area. You will wait too long to get your drink refilled and order taken. Sit at the sushi bar and let Richard spoil you. That is all.

Beer selection is no joke, but I've been to a few places with a few more obscure choices. I didn't get the same sports bar vibe as a few of the other reviewers, but my friend and I didn't actually get there until about 10:45 on a slow Friday night, so maybe the frat house crowd had already cleared out.  3 stars became 4 due to the excellent service we got. Very attentive and friendly, my partner in crime and I wanted for nothing. My suggestion is to get a seat at a table outside with a friend or two, grab a beer/drink and an app, and make fun of all the drunk douchebags leaving Margaritaville.

So much nicer than the one on Litchfield. Cleaner, easier to shop, and employees are much friendlier and more personable. I go miles out of my way just to hit this one up instead.

Dirty, indifferent (borderline rude) staff, the place is a pigsty, poor selection (poorly stocked, I guess), and did I mention the place is fucking filthy? Flies and crickets abound (and I don't mean the ones you can buy as lizard food), lots of bags of dog food leaking on to the floor, etc etc...just terrible...almost depressing.  To the employees at this establishment (who might be all related, from the vibe I got on a hot and humid day not too long ago) - I'm sorry you have to work retail, and on a Sunday. Bear in mind there's always someone out there who will gladly take your job and do it far better.

Came as part of a big group, don't think one server was quite enough but she was a trooper. Food came out way quicker than I thought it would and was not too shabby, perhaps a little pricey for what we got but not that big of a deterrent. The Mexican Roll is a slice of Hell in your mouth (not necessarily a bad thing) and honestly, their Baked Scallop/Dynamite/'whatever it's called in your neck of the woods' Roll is the best one I've EVER had. Very generous with the scallops and surimi and the roll still didn't disintegrate under the weight of the baked goodness. The GF wasn't a fan but we will try it again for happy hour, minus the large group.

Pretty nice place to share a meal with someone you love. Even in my long sleeve button down and nice jeans I felt overdressed. My ribeye was cooked perfectly, but seemed to lack something that I just couldn't place. Pepper jack mac and cheese was delicious, probably the best mac and cheese I've ever had. My date's trio of meat was, um, interesting...the elk was a little gamey for me but the buffalo was awesome.   Service here is incredible...we were the last table to leave and instead of ushering us out, we had a nice 20 minute conversation with our waiter (who shares a very rare last name with my date).

Doesn't even compare to the location at 24th St. and Camelback. I'd gladly drive an hour out of my way to get my Smashburger fix rather than settle on eating at this one. Service is slow and indifferent. Floors and tables are usually dirty. Even the fact I can get my beloved Cherry Coke here isn't enough for me. No thanks.

Was in there on Memorial Day Sunday with my homie from Ventura, visiting parents...stopped there (against my better judgment) on our way back to Cali because we're not privileged enough to have a Smashburger in Ventura County and all was good. Restaurant was clean, food was tasty, despite it picking up businesswise while we were there no one waited for food and the manager/staff were interacting with customers and cleaning up what messes were made.

Arizona Smashburger is quite possibly the best burger I've ever had (including the ones I make at home). Smashfries are hit and miss (sometimes not that hot, sometimes too oily, sometimes over/under seasoned, rarely perfect...but when they are, oh MAN)...same thing with the haystack onions. But even when this location has a line out the door I find the service to be good and wait times minimal.  I should note that this fine establishment proudly serves Cherry Coke.
