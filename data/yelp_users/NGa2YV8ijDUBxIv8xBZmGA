For the amount of money you spend on this course, you would expect faster pace of play. The staff was somewhat friendly and the course is in 8/10 shape. I just wanted to play my round faster and the stop and go threw my game off. Which made me even more frustrated.

My wife and I love this Chinese place. It's not to oily and the food is always delicious. The delivery is very fast as well. Great for a night you don't want to cook or go out!

This is the best tasting pizza in all of Arizona. I'm from NY and I was afraid I'd never find NY tasting pizza again and after watching Breaking Bad realized there is a Venezia's by me. I tried it and was blown away. Keep it up!

Usually this course is beautiful. I came today and spent decent money to play. The greens and fairways were horrible. I'd rather putt my ball on a bag of dicks then putt there again. Seriously it was that bad. I've played at courses where I spent the same amount of money and the course was just beautiful and lush. Last time I'm going there in the summer.

Course was beautiful! Just played and the greens were so true. If I could play this course everyday, I would. Service, value, pace of play are 5 star!

The worst customer service I've ever had. I will never buy another item in any location ever again because of the manager and her staff. I asked for a small bag and was rudely told "you need to buy something in order for us to give you a bag." I guess the $1500 coat I was about to buy but threw back down wasn't enough for them.

Room was great until we saw a scorpion in our room. Seriously? It was my first scorpion sighting so not only was I freaked out, I was excited! Service was good.

Dave was professional, courteous, and personable. He educated me on everything he was doing. We installed a pelican water softener/filter combo. He let me know if I needed anything to call and I'll definitely take him up on that!

So far the water softener is doing great. Dave's services were well worth it. He was at my house from 8a-2p installing it. Thanks Dave!

This was one of the best experiences I've had with a dentist. The staff we so personable and made me feel welcome. They even are all digital using iPads so that made it even better. The Dr. Howard Brauer was extremely welcoming and didn't try to sell me on products instead just made recommendations and you could feel he was genuine. I highly recommend them. They were also so gentle on my teeth.

I found out about this place watching diners, drive ins, and dives and when I moved out here my wife and I had to try it. We got the Fontina Cheese Burger which was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The pesto chicken sandwich was delicious if you love pesto. The onion rings were the best I've ever had. You must go if you live in the area. You won't be disappointed.

A friend told me that I had I try this place so I decided tonight was the night. We got there and it was different then most restaurants I've been to. Very cowboy, western feel. The wife and I had drinks and some appetizers and it was really good. I was given beer in a plastic cup but other than that it was good. The place is pretty big. There are a few bars on premise, an arcade room, and a separate place to cater a party. There were tons of fire pits and picnic tables and also tons of misters which felt great in 100 degree weather. I would come back here with a group of people to gran food and drinks.

Wow! This place is a hole in the wall and when we drove up we were apprehensive at first but when you walk in everyone is so friendly. My wife and I ordered the breakfast burrito with avocado inside and it was the biggest, most tastiest burrito we've ever had. We saved the other half for a snack later. I highly recommend this place for all who love the hard to find great breakfast brunch spots. Food, service and cleanliness are all 5 star in my book!

I went in so excited because I've never been in one of these stores before and I love golf. We'll let me tell you, I practically had to beg people to help me. Maybe it's because I wasn't buying anything. I had lots of questions but only wound up asking a few because I didn't want to feel like a nuisance. I'll be shopping at Dicks from now. They're way more helpful and a lot friendlier.

Dr. Jones was great. Very personable and really spent the time to get to know me. He asked me so many questions to try and properly diagnose me. A lot of the time, doctors will try and get you in and out but not here. Great job!

Dr. Johnson seriously is the best chiropractor I've been to. He's personable and cares so much about his patients. Sydney the massage therapist was thorough and I felt so good after. Great work recovery chiropractic.

I've been going to see Dr. Johnson for over a year now and he's still my favorite chiropractor I've ever had. His team is great. Jackie the receptionist is so friendly and welcoming. His whole team is A++. If you need a chiropractor, trust me he won't disappointment. It's a mom and pop type feel and if you're like me, you like being greeted by your name as soon as you walk through the doors. I highly recommend them. Tell them Frank B from Yelp sent you!

The operations GM gave everyone who entered the craziest attitude because the place was packed for World Cup. I didn't appreciate it at all. I asked for a seat and she said they're not seating anymore. I then asked so if someone leaves what happens. She said then if you're on the list you get the next seat. I was confused. I asked her to add me at the next available table.

Based on the reviews, I was really excited about coming here for my 30th but I guess I chose the wrong night to come with my wife. We showed up at 7:50p for an 8p reservation in a private booth. There's only 8 of them in the whole restaurant. The hostess comes to us at 8:05 and says our table is ready and begins to bring us to the back of the restaurant, not where we had reserved. When we said this isn't where we reserved, the bitchy hostess says "We're fully committed." What kind of a response is that especially when we reserved a spot. She said if we wanted to wait longer, we can have a private table. We decided to wait, and wait, and right before my 31st birthday the manager came over and said its going to be another 20-30 min. It's now 8:50p. I explained the situation and he apologized and said he'd comp a few drinks and apps. We settled and sat at a table and 10 minutes in he came over and said he'd love to move us to a private now because the couple before us left. He continued to explain they were there for almost 5 hours. We moved and began to order food.   Salt Block shrimp was good not great. Very fishy tasting so you can tell it wasn't as fresh as it could be.   Black truffle gnocchi and crushed potatoes were bland and needed salt.   12oz tenderloin was actually pretty good. I ordered medium and it was on the rare side.   The pan roasted chicken was really good.   Waitress was very nice but seemed robotic and not personable.   $250 later, 2 stars.

So Brad and I had some miscommunication at first but this guy really knows customer service. He called me up and went above and beyond to make sure he fulfilled all of my window cleaning needs and concerns. I'm excited to have his service completed this Sunday and I'm more than confident the job will be done right. Who else gives a 200% satisfaction guarantee? No one. Clearly Professional Window Cleaning embodies everything the name stands for.

Bought a groupon since my favorite (cobblestone auto spa) hasn't had a groupon in a while. I did not like the experience and they should call themselves a car dirtier because I feel my car was more dirty than when I brought it in.

I feel like you can never get an appointment with this facility. It also feels like they want you in and out extremely quick so they can take as many customers they can that day instead of spending time with each patient and caring. Their appointments are always weeks out and I just feel like a number instead of a person when I'm there. There are other, better businesses in the valley that you can find on Yelp. That's what I did and I've never been happier. They also haven't responded back to me in regards to getting my records.

Anyone who rates this restaurant anything less than 5 stars needs to go to the doctor and get their brain checked. The customer service and food is always on point and they are so consistent. Time and time again my wife and I go and we never have one complaint. They have an amazing formula going on there and if they remain on top of their game, they will be there for a long time.

If I could rate them lower I would. This is a property run by Mark Taylor Management. It's not a Mark Taylor property. I have felt fooled since the beginning. The management is so non customer service oriented it drove me nuts. They don't work with you as a resident. All you are to them is a $ sign and not a customer. Fidel Castro could probably provide better customer service then they do. It's sad and I would never recommend Mark Taylor to anyone. Go somewhere else like Pillar.

warning! do not come here anymore. my wife had a surgery done and it was totally messed up. dr kells told her, "well we can try it again if you want." is that a damn joke? dr kells is a joke and has absolutely no heart to be a doctor. i'm warning all women and their husbands, do not use this practice. Every time my wife comes home from this facility, she's crying with bad news. All we ask for is a doctor who shows a little empathy and treats a patient like he/she would treat someone in their family.

Walked in to order a pizza. What I wanted was very simple. A pizza pie and extra mozzarella cheese on the side so when I go home, I can put cold cheese on top of the warm pie. In NY, it's called cold cheese pizza. I was looked at like I was crazy and the manager said they don't do that because I'd be leaving with their product uncooked. I've been to many pizzerias in AZ, and never encountered this before. If I'm paying for the item, what I do with it after is none of your concern. Waiting in the pizzeria right now to try it for the first time, let's see how it goes. So far something very simple became very complex.

I went to Joyride with a friend and we were blown away by the customer service and food. The mojito we had was delicious and the tacos were incredible. The crispy fish taco was my favorite. Go as soon as you can! It's right next door to Postino's East which is also outstanding. Both owned by same owner.

I went in and bought breakfast, iced coffee, and two walnut chocolate chip cookies and when I ate one of the cookies I but I to something and almost broke my tooth. They said it was a walnut shell and they took my information down and I haven't heard from the company. They didn't even do anything. They said "oh we're so sorry" and that was pretty much it. I usually love their cookies but I'll never eat one again because I'm worried that I'll bite into something again.

Came here with my wife just to check it out. We love these little hole in the wall massage places and this was really good. We were treated very professionally and the receptionist was very nice. I definitely recommend it. $30 for an hour for full body massage.

Wow. That's all I'm going to say. Roger the chef was incredibly nice to my wife and I. He recommended a few things and he was 3 for 3. Food was the best seafood we've had since we lived in NY. Everyone must go and try if you love seafood. Crab cake, lobster bisque, lobster Mac n cheese. BOMBDOTCOM

I visited here before I went to Madison Ave Salon & Spa for a haircut. I walked in and there weren't many people inside at about 1p on a Thursday. I thought why not try it. The food was delicious and service was great. I would recommend silk to anyone.

I'm currently waiting for the doctor to come in right now but had some vitals and an EKG done by the technician and let me tell you this place is super friendly. Everyone has been really nice in a place that some might find frightening. I just wanted to make sure my heart was running normal lol so I made an appointment. I highly recommend this office. I'll reedit if I feel the doctor (Markabawi) wasn't worth it but so far I can only say great things.

Service was great and the food was better than it was when it was The Sushi Room. My wife and I used to go to the sushi room often. They changed the name because they added a teppanyaki table. Same owner though and pretty much the same menu.

Tried it today for the first time and went around noon. Not too many people inside so I ate at the bar. The bar tender recommended wings and pizzetta. They were both delicious. I ordered my wings crispy and well done. The Italian style kind and they came out perfect.

We usually have such a good time when we go but it seems like many of the familiar faces I've seen are all gone. The wait time wasn't bad at all but the service wasn't good. We went to golf, eat, and drink and the food was great but we had to ask for everything as our server kept forgetting. Brought food with no plates. We ask for napkins thinking he'd bring silverware and brings just napkins. Then we wanted to change the channel because our bay had a broken tv and it took 30 min for someone to change it. By then, our time was up. After spending X amount of dollars in 60 min on play, food, drinks we get told we can't sit there anymore because there's a wait to get in. Two things wrong here, first off we just spent a ton and for a kid server to tell us we can't stay and sit there but we can eat inside is wrong. Second off, there was absolutely no wait. It was probably the most dead I've seen it ever. Just a poor experience last night. But hey, everyone has a bad night sometimes.

Dan was the nicest guy! Conversed for about 5 Minutes and then he was right to work. By the time I came back (20 minutes later), my knives were neatly wrapped and packaged ready to go. He is passionate about what he does and it shows in his work. My knives are better than they were when I got them and my wife and I are ready for Thanksgiving! He also hand crafts his own line of knives which were beautiful. I'd like to buy them for myself and a friend who is a chef. He uses top of the line materials to ensure a great experience. Quality work for a great price!

My wife and I tried this place for the first time tonight. After reading the reviews, we felt this was a place for a date night on Saturday.   We walked in and the atmosphere was great. The decor was beautiful and Mike was our waiter.   The service was A+ and the food was incredible.   We tried the bread and garlic appetizer and the empanadas. Delicious. We then had the sea bass and bone in rib eye. Wow.   I highly recommend this place!

I love this new car wash. I just hope they can continue looking and feeling like a new car wash. I did the unlimited wash for $30 per month. Unlimited washes!! The equipment they have works really well and when you park you car after I love that they not only have vacuums for the car that are powerful, but they have compressed air too! The system they have to let people into the car wash is also genius. I rave about this wash!

Went in on a lunch break and the sandwich I had was delicious. I believe it was the roasted turkey sandwich with chipotle aioli and avocado. Wow! So good. I love restaurants that spend time on design and layout. It felt very modern with a rustic feel. Open kitchen concept and the bar was smack in the middle. I'll definitely try it again!
