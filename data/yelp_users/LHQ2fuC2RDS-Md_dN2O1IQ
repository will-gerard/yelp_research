This place has a subpar menu, its just not very appealing to try some of the more adventurous stuff. I stuck to the tried and true teriyaki chicken. It really isn't very amazing here, its ok. If you're near the theatre, want to grab a quick bite before the show, and you are really craving some asian food, you could give it a try. Otherwise I'd just go elsewhere.  Staff is not very friendly at this place, I imagine its family run, but they seem like they could care less if you could eat here. I really don't like places like this that think they'll stay in business just because they got an awesome location. Aside from the person who takes your order, doesn't smile, and doesn't really say a word there is no service to rate here. The food isn't terrible, it just isn't amazing.

I know this place a little too well. Hmm lets see, most Indian ocassions I attend get their food catered by Copper Ketle. So, over the course of a couple of years, I've eaten this food over 30-40 times. That's a lot.  The naan and chicken is good. This is the staple of good Indian food. If you can't do good naan and tandoori chicken, you fail as an Indian restaurant. They also have pretty good qorma, tikka, etc. Biryani is hit or miss, its never terrible, but its never 5-star.   If you eat the food at a catered event it is very hit or miss, sometimes the meat in the qorma is just BAD. Either its too fatty, or too boney, or not enough meat. At the restaurant its a much different experience.  The only other issue that keeps this from getting 5-stars is the cleanliness. I hate to bring this up, but there are rumors that the restaurant shut down due to food inspection (and they only catered until the restaurant reopened). i'm not picky about cleanliness, as long as i don't find out about it i don't care, but this is somewhat troublesome.

This is a hole-in-the-wall type restaurant. Its part of a market/grocery store as everyone else has already noted. Its a little hidden, and I think that hurts this place a little bit.  Anyways, the food is VERY good. The chicken shawarma is probably some of the best I have ever had. Hummus, yellow rice, and couscous also go very well with the food. There is the garlic-butter sauce that comes with the shawarma and kabobs, and that REALLY makes the food that much better. Gyro plate is also very commendable, but its hard to get this wrong since the gyro comes on a huge slab and rotates on a rotisserie. Yet, a lot of places do get the gyro plate wrong. I think this place does a good job of heating up the gyro meat on the rotisserie and then the grill.  Baklava also deserves a mention. Its damn good. You can get some exotic mediterranean stuff like olives and feta cheese by the pound, i love that stuff.  The pricing of this place along with the good quality food makes this place a hidden gem. Its like $8 for almost any plate you'd want. Its plenty of food per plate, and for under $20 for 2 people, its worth a visit. Its very easy to compare this stuff to haji baba, its a tough pick. However, I think the hummus here tastes much better, it doesn't taste like its straight out of a can. The plates here I think are a better deal. If you just want a gyro sandwich, then go to haji baba.

Gross. I-mart has now expanded to include a restaurant just a few doors down from the market. Wise decision, because the market part smells whack. It is pretty obvious and common knowledge that they cut their meat in the back of the store. I suppose the market and restaurant deserve their own review, but I think its the same rating, I'll just merge them.  The market has your basic Indo-Pak foods. Don't confuse the owner for an Indian or Paki though, he's from Bangladesh. He's an extremely nice guy, but I feel like every since he moved from Tempe, near ASU, his store has just lost substance. If you need to buy substantial amounts of halal meat I suggest you go elsewhere, probably Baiz Market would be a good idea. The meat here is very inconsistent. He's got your basic Shan masala amongst other odd brands. Of course he has asian rice and everything else you'd really expect from this type of store. The mango juices he stocks are weird, but he has some Pakistani soda, Pakola. That's pretty cool.  The restaurant should be avoided. My fellow Indo-Pak friends rave about this place all the time, but I don't think they know any better. I walked in and the owner was taking orders... I was slightly confused and surprised (today was the first time I went to the restaurant). I thought to myself, "Hey man, he's usually at the store cuttin' my meat, what the heck is he doing here?" He must have made the food, because when he disappeared again he didn't reappear until my food was ready. My friends had bought me a tandoori chicken wrap, I'm being very ungrateful, but it was not enjoyable at all. The naan was obviously microwaved a few seconds too long, because by the time I got to it it was like chewing on plastic. Taking bites out my 'wrap' was just painful. I'm sad because the filling was actually pretty good, but how can you overmicrowave naan to that point? It's like overmicrowaving your hotpocket (just follow the damn directions).  The owner clearly wants to retire soon, he first moved from the ASU location to a much smaller store, and now he is barely focusing on the store. To make things worse, he decided to open up a restaurant. If you could compare this place to a legit Indo-pak restaurant, it'd be something like comparing Filiberto's to Chipotle. Everyone likes Chipotle, but only some people can stand Filiberto's.

Oh dear, this one of those fusion restaurants, they want to be authentic Mediterranean but they need to be extra certain they are catering to their demographics. If ya know what i'm sayin'.  Anyways, this place is decent. The only issue I have is that the food is overpriced and really isn't very authentic. This fact combined with the fact that its not a lot of food for your money, aka bad value makes it lose a few points in my book.  The service is good, the staff is very friendly and its worth a visit, who knows you might like it? If you can't make it to Haji Baba in Tempe, or Baiz Market in Phoenix, then I suppose you can check this place out. Don't expect to be wowed too much. I pretty much never crave the food here, and the only reason it might be worth coming here is if you have a party of like 4 or more. Haji Baba and Baiz probably cannot realistically accommodate large parties.

This is like the 4th Indian food review I'm writing in one night...So, I'll make a rubric:  for the buffet: Naan: indian food staple - 5 star Tandoori chicken: another indian food staple - 5 star curry selection: bleh, i'm a little picky, it was a decent selection -3 star desserts: decent selection, gulab jamun was good, not a fan of the other stuff - 4star service: good  by the way, i just made the cardinal sin of referring to curry as 'curry'. there is no such thing. qorma, tikka, salan, etc are all your 'curry' dishes, but they are all very different and using those words makes it much more apparent as to what you can expect from the sauce.  decent indian food if you're in AZ. the search continues for some indian food that compares to the stuff you get in cali.

Great sandwiches and soups. Very unique tasting stuff here. Their salads are also good. I usually do the wildflower pick two, and I'm never really disappointed. I'm usually not into these 'bread company' places, but I think this place is unique. I've really only been here for lunch and dinner so I can't comment on breakfast, but I know they serve it.   The pick two combo is amazing for price, I'm not sure I'd go for any of the other stuff. The chai latte was also surprisingly good. Service is excellent, and food is always served promptly. NEVER had an issue when I went here. Great, consistent, good food.   soup/bread boules (i think they spell it weird) are good too. this place is DEFINITELY worth a look.

I walked in and I was immediately digusted by this place. Want a crap load of peanuts? No seriously, when you walk in there is a huge bushel of peanuts, and you can get as much as you want! Done with the shells? Just leave them on the table then brush them aside. The end result? A restaurant with peanut shells all over the place. Actually, to be quite honest, I'm being a little harsh here. I thought it was cool that they did this unlimited free peanuts thing, but it was like they were trying to compensate for something else.  Well, when I got my food I figured out what they were trying to compensate for. The salad and 'breadsticks' were just plain bad. However, I didn't really expect much. I was actually hoping my wings would be good and that the salad was just a side. The wings are nothing special at all. I thought the 'El Hefe' wings were somewhat decent, but I don't think I could have more than a half-dozen of those. Hot wings? What hot wings? I thought I ordered some, but maybe the waiter got confused. I got some cold wings with red sauce on them, they tasted 'vinegary' and that's about all.  To be fair, the service was pretty good and the server was friendly. She was helping us make decisions since it was our first time, but the food was cold on multiple occasions. A previous reviewer mentioned gorgeous staff... Not quite sure why you would prefer that instead of good food, go to a strip club? Maybe if the food was hot it could be different, but I really doubt it since the recipes here are just way off the mark.  There is really nothing special about this place. The wings are over priced for what you get, and there is better stuff available 5 minutes away from here. I love wings, and I've been trying so hard to find a good wing place in Phoenix, but I think my search continues for the time being.

Good place for pizza, perhaps one of the best in the area. Great slice/combo specials. A slice, 6 wings, and a drink is more than enough to fill me up. The pizza is good, the staff are friendly, and even the wings are good.   I like to get the slice combos, but they don't really bake the toppings into the pizza, so they kind of fall off (unless the pizza was already cooked with the toppings). Otherwise, the crust, sauce, and cheese are all very good.  The wings are pretty amazing as well. I like honey hot is weird, its like hot but just honey on top, and its very watery, which makes the wings soggy. Weird. The mustard hot and hot are pretty good complements to a slice of pizza.  I did the party pizza challenge with a friend. Its a little tough, about 10 slices per person, but definitely doable. We weren't on drugs when we did it like some other people were, who somehow happened to finish it in 5-10 minutes. Ie, at the Tempe location, two sorority looking girls did it in 15 (they probably weighed no more than 200 lbs combined). Meanwhile, my friend and I, weighing in around 350 lbs did it in 35 minutes. Am I whining about a food contest? No, just don't try this expecting to get it done.  This place has been pretty consistent the few times I've been there. I appreciate that. I hate it when a place is awesome the first two or three times, then it drops off in quality and can be a coin flip every time you go. So far its been very consistent.  They stay well connected with their patrons on FB/twitter. I won a free slice through a contest. Free stuff is always cool. It shows that they appreciate us.  Ahh the raiting. This was close. I can't think of anything particularly special about this place. The pizza isn't special, the wings aren't special, and I haven't tried much else. However, I wouldn't hesitate to come here ever, and there are times when I get cravings for this place. There isn't much in Tempe that is close to this sorta stuff. My baby brother loves this place as well, and so does my GF. I'm sure they'll never say no if I wanted to come here, so I think that means this place deserves a 5.

This is an excellent restaurant if you want fancy persian food. I guess I should have known from the location, but this place is very posh. I'm not usually a fan of restaurants like this, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Now, let me start off by saying that I wasn't very ecstatic about visiting this place simply due to the fact that I knew it'd be pricey. My good friend ended up paying for the dinner, so I was definitely a little bit less critical. If you have a special occasion, and need persian food, then this is the place to go. The atmosphere is great and very high-end. The food is great, but the pricing...we'll get to that later.  Service is excellent as you would expect for such a great atmosphere. Like I said, this is a very high-end persian restaurant. The staff is friendly, and the waiters are very attentive. I really don't remember one bad thing about the staff at all. 5-star experience here.  Food is excellent as well. My two friends and I shared a kabob platter that came with chicken, beef, and lamb kabobs. They were all very perfectly cooked and extremely tender and juicy. We got burberry rice to go along with it, and while at first it was delicious, I think it just came with too much rice. They make their own naan, or whatever Persians call their bread. To me, this is worthy enough for a visit. There are very few places in Phoenix that make their own naan, especially Arab/Greek/Med places.  Dessert? Yeah, again, I was skeptical about the pistachio ice cream, but my friend ended up ordering it anyways (he's a regular at this place). Again, WOW. The ice cream was served in chilled cups, and it was just amazing. You could tell it was homemade ice cream, and the pistachio flavoring was just sublime. If you come here for a special occasion, and you have a significant other, you will score well if you order the ice cream. The texture of the ice cream was just perfect.  So why did I give this place a 4-star? I feel that if my friend paid $80 for food for the three of us that he should have taken a significant portion home. He took the leftover rice, and maybe 3 bites of kabobs. The pricing would be great if you got a little bit more food. Of course, you can argue quality over quantity, but I doubt they'd be losing money if they threw just a little bit more meat into their $45 meat sampler/platter. If you want to try something new for your significant other, or a special party or something then come here. Don't be upset though if your wallet is hurting afterwards.  I'm really torn about this place, and I want to give this place a 5-star (the food totally deserves it), but I just don't think I can ever go back, unless Obama gives me a stimulus package for my hunger.

Ah, Four Peaks. Awesomeness.  The first time I went here was during World Cup 2010. It was packed because of the USA/Algeria game, which created quite the atmosphere.   Service was pretty good. We got a table fairly quickly, and the server was always checking back and forth despite how crowded they were. The only issue I think there might be is that this place doesn't have adequate parking, so if you are going when ASU is playing UA or something of the sort, then arrive VERY early.  The food is awesome. Probably one of the best breakfasts I ever had, and it wasn't really anything unique. Just some eggs, toast, and potatoes, but they were all just done extremely well. The only downside is the price, it cost like $8 for what normally costs like $5-6 elsewhere. The portions weren't ridiculously huge either, but overall it was worth the atmosphere. I've played soccer with the owner a few times and he's a cool guy.  I would pretty much ALWAYS come here, if they were open for EPL games!

Us:"Where are you located, north side or south side of the street?" Texano's guy: "Inside"  Cool...I thought I was gonna have to whip up my Spanish to order some food here. I'm fairly fluent after 5 years of studying, so I thought we'd be ok. Then we drive into the parking lot and figure we'd have to go to the back to get our car wash. New-car scent please. Seriously though, I think this place was an old carwash place or something. The bathrooms are on the side of the building, not connected at all to the dining area.  My significant other and I visited this place upon the recommendation of my friend. I feel like recently he's been sending us on a wild goose chase. First he sent us to Grimaldi's which didn't live up to the hype, but I think he finally got something right.  We ordered the california burrito per Steven G's recommendation, and while it was an interested interpretation of an old burrito, it fell short in one or two areas. There definitely was not enough meat in the burrito, sadly, because if there was this place would be a 5 star. I felt full afterwards, but I'm usually even fuller after Filiberto's due to their generous portions of meat. However, the burrito is still worth a shot. I thought to myself while eating it, "Wow, humans really got it right with meat and potatoes. You can serve it up so many ways, and it never fails." Think about it for a second, steak and mashed potatoes, hamburger and fries, california burrito, and there are probably dozens more I left out.  While this place has all the salsas you'd expect to find at your local Fili-B, it also had a mysterious green salsa that wasn't clear. I'm guessing this was the coveted "jalapeno salsa". It had a creamy smooth texture and taste, but also had a hint of fire. Filibertos has nothing like this, and it was simply amazing. Couple their impressive salsa line up with some chips, which come with your burrito, and you have a winning combination. One thing I feel worth mentioning though is that the salsa is a bit more watery than what you are used to at Fili-B.  Its unfortunate that there is no Fili-B near ASU. However, this place fills the gap just perfectly, and its actually an interesting place to try out. They are also open 24/7.

This place is disgustingly gross. Its so gross, its almost disrespectful, do they seriously expect people to eat this? Well, I guess they do expect dumb people to eat this, and the only people who are dumb enough to eat this I guess are the loads of ASU students in the area. Oh wait, it makes sense now, they are still in business because drunk ASU kids eat food from one of the few places that is open 24/7.  Do not get chicken as a pizza topping, its breaded chicken. Pizza dough was gross, soggy, not done well. The sauce was super watery and tasted bad as well. We ordered garlic knots, and well, the same thing here. In fact, the garlic knots had no garlic, there was just some garlic sauce on the side and some marinara (tasted like crap). I think I had the worst pizza I've ever had in my life. I think frozen pizza tastes 10x better.  Gus's is disGUSting. I think if you wanted to make pizza at home you'd do a much better job even if you can't make microwave popcorn.

The pictures made this place look REALLY REALLY good. I'm a little bewildered that my pizza didn't look as good as the photos. Actually, I'm a little disappointed, because I am really into greasy pizza and this pizza was quite the opposite, I suppose my fiancee would be into this place.  I also ordered a dozen 'hot' wings, which were pretty interesting. No hot sauce, they seemed to have been just dusted with some spices. It wasn't amazing, and it wasn't bad, just slightly above average.  Overall, I liked the pizza, it was pretty good. The crust was simply amazing, the edges were fluffy in the inside and just crusty enough on the outside. The middle of the crust was well done, and extremely thin, but at the same time you could fold it over without having to worry about making a mess. The only complains I have is that the pizza was a little dry, both the sauce and the nongreasiness of the cheese. I'll be back to see if it can get better, because I think this place has a lot of potential.

TL;dr amazing mediterranean food, with plenty of meat options that will blow your mind. you've never had meat like this before.  I'm really confused as to how I don't have a review for this place already. After living in Tempe/Phoenix for over 20 years, I remember craving gyros from Haji Baba even as a kid. In fact, I would venture to say Haji Baba and Baiz Market are the oldest, quality middle eastern shops in the valley.  Apparently my friend has never been here before, and I decided I would be a terrible friend if I never took him. Of course, he had trouble finding it because he thought it was a restaurant "restaurant" and not a hole-in-the-wall type place.  We were seated even though it was lunch, didn't take more than 10 minutes for our gyro plates to come out which were piled high with succulent gyro meat. To perfectly complement the star of the dish, there was white rice and a salad with plenty of unique dressing. Gyro meat by itself is usually amazing, simply because its meat, but when its accompanied with an amazing sauce, it really becomes stellar. The "white sauce" or what I think is an iteration of tsaziki sauce is perfect for the juicy ground lamb meat. If you haven't had gyro before and you want to give a try, I would definitely get the gyro plate at Haji Baba.  I almost forgot to mention that you can't leave Haji Baba without trying their baklava. Take your pick at which nuts you want. pistachio, almonds, walnuts, mixed, etc.   Aside from their restaurant food, my family usually buys groceries from here. One of our staples is pita bread, and you can usually get a box of pita bread for like $13. Freeze some of it, and use the rest as you wish. It goes perfectly with store bought hummus and foul (fava beans).

Jesus christ. I've never had a bigger headache in my life.  I usually do small maintenance on my cars myself, but the spark plugs on this GM 3800 V6 were just a PITA. So, I decided to take my car to Pep Boys and just have them swap it. They quoted $85, but then then when I got there they told me they charge $5 extra per plug if I already got them. What? That's ok, I wasn't ready to return my NGK platinums. Even with the $5 extra per plug for installing them, the NGKs were cheaper than the autolite crap they were trying to sell me. Then he tried to tell me to buy spark plug wires from them and have them install it, even though I didn't want to have that done. Besides, no one replaces spark plug wires.  I signed all the paperwork, and was ready to give the guy the keys when i realized that I had forgotten some stuff in the car. As a student, I was just going to drop off my car and head take the light rail to campus. However, when I came back to drop off the keys, the guy helping me disappeared for 30 minutes. No one bothered to help or track this guy down while I was waiting. Whatever.  He calls later during the day to tell us that they broke the spark plug wires. Instead of offering to repair a problem they causes, he tells us we have to pay not only for the one spark plug wire, but the other 5 as well. What is going on here? Bank robbery? Grand theft auto? This guy was ridiculous. When we asked to speak to a manager over the phone, the ridiculous employee said that there was no manager available. We called the next day, and surprise, no manager available. Really? This is some really sketch stuff. When we finally got to speak to a manager, he solved the problem for us and offered to put the wires in for free if we paid for the wires. To be quite honest, if we wanted the wires, and we were getting the plugs changed anyways, it should have been free to begin with. How long does it take to replace the wires if you're already swapping the plugs, 5 seconds?  I'm starting to wonder if they really changed the spark plugs or not. You're better off dealing with another shop. Save yourself 3 days worth of time and don't go here, even for a simple oil change.

First timer here. Had to visit based upon the stellar reviews this place gets.  Its very, very old school here, but I like the feeling. Its different from the usual atmosphere you get at the other places. For a mom and pop shop, the prices for the food were very reasonable, and the food was also definitely very good. It gets really busy during lunch, but that doesn't really make the service any worse. Except for the fact that I asked for a water, and the guy at the counter (Gordon?) asked if I wanted 'Tempe tap' or bottled. I asked for tap, and then....nothing happened.  My italian beef came out surprisingly fast, and it was quite delicious. For $6.25 you get a sandwich and some chips which is pretty good. Except for the fact that they pretty much only have Poore Brothers chips, which is awesome.   Have to take a star off because there is no tap water on their fountain. I ended up having to go to my car to grab my bottle of water for my lunch.  Other than that, really good sandwiches for the price. Decent service.

I fixed my friends' computer so he agreed to take me to lunch. Of course, I had been meaning to check out Chuckbox a while ago because all of my friends go every Friday for lunch. In fact, for some of them Chuckbox is so special that it can only be had on Fridays for lunch. As such, I was kind of excited to see what the hype was about.  Ordering your food is really simple, their menu is really basic and its easy to figure out what you want to eat. Even though I don't care much for the white or wheat dilemma, I still thought it was cool that they offered such a choice. But I like to be old fashioned, "Big one" + fries and a cup of water. You can smell Chuckbox from a mile away sometimes because they are grilling ridiculous amounts of meat. The aroma is extraordinary, and you would probably forget that you're in the scorching AZ sun.   Once you actually get your burger you pay, cash only, and take your sandwich to the condiments bar. They have pretty much all the basics you'd want in your burger. They even have extra lettuce and ranch, which equates to a free salad. Are you winning yet?  Overall, the burgers were extremely flavorful, and it was plenty of food for the money. The only downside is that beef patties were frozen and that takes away from some of the flavor. Its not that I have anything personal against frozen beef, it just doesn't have the same juicyness as something that's not frozen. For this same reason, I think it loses a star. Other than that, its a perfect burger joint.

Baiz Market is a "Mediterranean" type restaurant, or "Arabic" type food. Well, you could get confused and call it that. The fact of the matter is though, that this place has a very unique touch. This restaurant is a staple not only for groceries, but also its food. The owner is persian, so you can tell where the tastes are coming from. Its somewhat hidden in the heart of Phoenix, but that's ok, once you are there you will be glad you found it.  This place is unique because they make their own bread! Are you kidding me? I only recently found out about this place like 3 years ago, and I've been living in Phoenix for 20 years. The chicken and beef shawarma have a special, authentic taste because of the fresh bread. One of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste, but the pricing is very fair as well. I don't think I can stress this enough, but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the Phoenix metro area. Why haven't the other restaurants caught on? I know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread, but their pricing makes them a different story (I'm talking about 'The Persian Room' in Scottsdale).  I just don't understand how other restaurants can serve the bread that comes in plastic bags from a manufacturer hundreds of miles away. 'Good bread' and 'Arabic bread' are all good forms of pita that have great shelf life due to the ridiculous amounts of preservatives, but they just don't taste fresh.  If you like the bread, head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread, its baked throughout the day, I think. I can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation. Beware though, the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days, so you really need to use it quickly. This isn't bad, its just I think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita.  I usually just get the chicken or beef shawarma, but I decided I'd get a kabob plate one day because I also wanted hummus. The beef kabob plate came with hummus, bread, 2 skewers of beef kabob, and some pickles and onions. Wow. The beef kabobs were cooked perfectly, and were EXTREMELY tender. It was a tad bit on the lemony side, but I suppose that was necessary to make it so tender. Perhaps some of the best 'persian kabobs' I have ever had. The hummus was definitely good as well, I can't stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus. This restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus.  I know friends in Tucson that make stops specifically at this place for shawarma, and rightly so. If you're weary of persian food, just check this place out. Its not expensive at all, food for two is like $15. The wide variety of ethnic foods is also interesting.

My significant other had a $25 off coupon from Restaurant.com LOL. That could sum up the whole trip. I haven't been to many restaurants that participate with restaurant.com that are decent at all. I mean, I wasn't expecting much coming into this place, I shouldn't have expected anything here.  I was in the mood for some red meat, and sushi places do actually have decent dishes like teriyaki chicken and stuff like that sometimes. So, I didn't mind checking this place out since I do like a little bit of sushi on the side. The boolgogee, plain, simply plain. There was a salad with the boolgogee, but it too was plain. There wasn't nearly enough meat to warrant a price tag of $8, because the salad and rice probably didn't cost more than $0.50 to make.  Oh, the sushi? All of the sushi we happened to get were either super plain or super spicy. By spicy, I mean that there were just too many tastes going on at the same time and it was too overwhelming. I tried a few bites of the 3-4 different rolls we got. After I tried each roll I thought that I liked it but that the taste was too overwhelming for me to want to try another bite. We paid $18 for the food even after the coupon, and I honestly think that even at the price it might be a bit of a rip off considering you can get cheaper, higher quality sushi at Teharu.  This place is a rip-off for sushi in my opinion. Its not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag. The sad part is that the interior is very well done, if the food was actually good this place would be extremely interesting.

Gosh, I spent about 2 hours here, but enjoyed every second of it thanks to some amazing food.  We started off with some calamari and wings. While I'm not a big fan of calamari, I absolutely LOVE wings. Oregano's wings were pretty damn amazing. It has to be up there with the top 1% of wings I've tried. The timing of the appetizers was pretty nice as well. Calamari came out first, then the wings shortly after, and finally...  THE AMAZING PIZZA. wow. the chicago pan crust pizza was simply perfection. everything was perfect about it. the only downside was that it came straight out of the oven to our table, and so if you tried to get a slice everything would fall off. My advice would be to wait for the pizza to cool off before you even attempted to take a slice. Other than that, try not to cream in your mouth from the orgasm you'll have from eating this slice of amazingness. Seriously, it is perfect in so many ways. The crust has an amazing texture, the cheese is perfectly melted, the toppings aren't crap, and the sauce is the pinnacle of evolution and mother nature.  To top off all of this, it was cheap. I think we paid $20 for calamari, 9 wings, and a 10" pan pizza with 2 sodas. Now I'm confused if that is actually how much we paid...  I suppose the one thing we didn't try was the pizza cookie...oh well, now I have an excuse to go back.

I remember coming here not too long ago with my family. We ordered the usual stuff that we order when we go to any chaat place.   Its just plain ol' chaat. To be honest, there is nothing here that will make you have dreams at night or bring you back for more. Its just plain chaat. Even for a city like Phoenix, which overall doesn't have amazing chaat, there is better in town.

WOWOWOWOWOWOW.  So, driving by Gelato 64 for years because it is right next to Lee Lee's, I decided it would be in my best interests to try it out. If I didn't, my asian citizenship might have been taken away.  There are now only 2 places that come to my mind when I want gelato. Angel Sweets and Gelato 64. By far, these are the two best places for gelato. There isn't even a contest.  The strawberry cheesecake had an amazing texture that was somehow gelato and still had remnants of cheesecake. It was a perfectly well done recipe with the perfect amount of sweetness and just a hint of tartness from the strawberries.  Double fudge chocolate brownie was also mind bogglingly delicious. Again, the texture was perfected to give your mouth an explosion that would rival the creation of the universe. The brownie 'chunks' were sized perfectly and it made every small bite a pleasure to have.   I can't recommend this place enough. I usually hate to drive to Lee Lee's because of the darn fish smell, but I will be more than happy to drop my mom off to do her shopping while I enjoy a soothing sample of Arizona's finest gelato.

Bloody awesome. Seriously.  Ok, my significant other and I walked in around 8 pm on a Friday night. I think if we came a little earlier we'd probably have to wait for seating. We thought the place would be larger, its a little small, but that's ok. It felt like we were in a British pub, and I've been dying to go to London. No, but seriously, the atmosphere is really cool and very original. Service as well as the staff here are very friendly and really cool.  I don't drink, but the prospect of getting to choose from tons of locally brewed and imported beer is appealing. We ended up ordering a cheese steak pasty and a chicken tikka masala pasty. I was extremely skeptical and thought I was going to be in for a big disappointment. What business did this British pub even have THINKING about chicken tikka masala? To my surprise, I think I just tasted the BEST CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA IN PHOENIX. Hold up, Cornish Pasty Company, a BRITISH type PUB HAS THE BEST CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA in PHOENIX. I know, you must think I'm nuts, but I'm Indian and I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing interpretation of a stereotypical Indian dish. The tikka masala overshadowed the cheesesteak which I thought was rather bland. I think the issue here was that the chicken tikka was so overwhelmingly awesome. I can't wait to go back and have the tikka masala again and perhaps try something else.  Everything here is super fresh, you can see them making the pasties and dough and everything. The pasties have a perfect texture and are golden brown on the outside. If you're unsure of what a pasty is, it is basically a chicken bake or calzone, but with different fillings. Really awesome.  It'd be awesome if the owner of this place decided to get a few TVs, then it'd be even more pub like. Also,  it'd be super duper awesome if he decided to pick up some English Premier League games on the weekends. I would most definitely come down for some breakfast pasties and watch a few games.

There is a reason countries like China are rising up. Because we're electing idiots like Jan Brewer. I mean, who cares if she was left as the caretaker Governor, but to re-elect her? One of our state's biggest blunder.  Her victory speech included bashing on the president and threatening to challenge the federal government. Hey, why not secede from the union at the same time? We're already allowing some highly unconstitutional stuff, like SB 1070. It wouldn't be too far fetched to think that Brewer might actually one day propose this insane idea. Pretty much the whole state wasn't against SB 1070, yet here we are, we voted her back in.  Then we go and vote in other republicans along with her. Great.

Good pizza. Too pricey though. The price implies some sort of specialty, but in reality its just the same old regular NY style pizza. Garlic knots are interesting, but I think this place needs to address the pricing issue.

A sporadic text message from my friend had me wondering what to have for lunch. Before I could figure it out, he was already ready to go. So I turned on the GPS on my phone, and found a place nearby on Yelp. I really hesitated to go here, and was so close to insisting on Chipotle instead. However, I figured I would give NYPD another shot.  I rarely leave food unfinished, even if its mediocre. But the wings that came with the lunch special were so bad that I just could not finish them. If there wasn't any hot sauce, I probably would have vomited. Did they decide to just take week old wings and serve them? I am incredibly disappointed. I seriously have never had wings as bad as NYPD's in my entire life.  The pizza slice was ok, but seriously why bother selling stuff that is just plain terrible? I'm really going to hesitate coming back here. In fact, I probably wouldn't come here even if a friend invited me for lunch and paid for it. One of my worst experiences ever.

Championship establishment here.  I walked in with my significant other and was surprised at how busy it was on a Tuesday night. At first, it didn't click but the entire volleyball team from a nearby high school decided to come so it was extremely busy.  They have some really good specials, but what really caught my eye was the specialty burgers that are $6. Big misunderstanding, most $6 are single patty and have some special toppings. Zipps decided to do a double-stacked specialtly burger. Yes, two 1/3 lb patties on a bun with some special toppings. We got two burgers and split them half and half, green chile burger and sweet jalapeno. Both were extremely awesome. You can get salad, fries, onion rings or half-half (half fries half onion rings). The fries kind of taste like In-n-Out fries, and my significant other would describe them as being better. I don't agree, and I don't disagree. Overall, good food, I can't wait to come back and try something else from their special menu. The $6 specialty burgers are available Tuesdays from 8-close and weekends from 11-4.  The service was really awesome. They definitely cared about us and went out of their way to make sure we were doing okay. I think they felt guilty that we were there when a huge group was there as well. Apparently, they also were understaffed, but it honestly did not feel like it. Seriously though, it was some of the best service I've ever had at a Phoenix restaurant. To top it all off, the manager had checked up on us a few times, and at the end after we paid the bill he brought us a cookie platter (pizzookie, or cookie with ice cream).  Now, I'm not a fan of pizzookie, but wow, their cookie platter was awesome. It wasn't on special that night, but I know its on special some other night and at $4 its probably worth a go again. Might I say one more thing about the cookie platter? It's just as good if not better than BJ's.  I am actually excited to go here again. With some really good food specials almost any night, I think if I ever run out of ideas this might be the first place I think of. The food is a little greasy, but I think that is expected when you go to a sports grill. Want to lose 50 lbs, go to subway. Props to the owners for such an awesome establishment.

What an absolute joke of a company. They mask their bait and switch policy, sure they rates look extremely good on carrentals.com or kayak or whatever, but whatever little money you save is not worth dealing with these pricks. I made a reservation on carrentals.com for $5/day for a compact + fees/taxes, which for 5 days ended up being $66. Unfortunately, I didn't read the Yelp reviews... FML  S(customer service): hi, do you have a registration, license and credit card? *usual chit chat, where you from, what are you doing here, etc* CS: do you want to upgrade to a camaro, its a nice sports car... me: no thank you CS: its super fun, you sure you don't want a sports car? me: no thanks, i have one already, but my brother is borrowing it CS: are you sure?  me: yes, thanks for the offer CS: ok, what about insurance? me: no thanks CS: are you sure? me: already have insurance through my amex card *its $20/rental for $75k worth of insurance on any rental vehicle when you use your amex for a car rental* CS: ok, what about adding additional drivers or GPS? me: no thanks CS: we have a prepaid fuel option, i'm adding it on, if you bring the car back full you won't have to pay it. me: ok great, thank you so much CS: ok, so the total is going to be $98, since you only paid $54 you'll have to pay the difference somehow... me: ok, here is my amex... CS: *mumbles something about how it's going to be the difference + $200* *card declines, approaching limit since we just got back from pricey europe trip* me: try this card *i hand him debit* CS: *mumbles something about how if i give him a credit card he has to check my credit...* me: *thinks for a second, i don't need a needless credit check* oh wait, no, don't run it, use this card. *i hand him another cc, it was probably a closed account, but i guess it was our only shot, i don't like to have too many credit card accounts).* CS: if i run this and it declines i can't rent you a card....declined me: ok, well just run it through my debit CS: nah, i can't do that, i can't sit here all day running cards. i'm going to have to refund you. ok, here is your refund receipt. me: uh, this isn't written anywhere in your policy... we have a reservation with you... CS: yeah, its just policy... me: can we speak to a supervisor? CS: they're probably all at lunch *time was around 1:30 at this point* me: why don't you check for us, please? CS: *mashes some numbers on phone line and says they're all at lunch*  at this point we thought we'd just go back and use the wifi to quickly make another reservation. so we did that, and came back, and he said even though it was another reservation since he ran our card 3 times already that day that he can't do it for another 24 hours lol. ultimately we wasted almost 2 hours with that asshat between standing in line and dealing with him. we gave up, went to costco travel, and rented with alamo for $76 for the same timeframe, and got through the rental counter within like 5 minutes.   the fees on carrentals.com are inaccurate, they estimated our total would be $54, but the fee estimate they gave us was wrong, the total was actually around $66 at advantage. essentially, i wouldn't waste my time with asshats like advantage, i had done some research before hand and heard horror stories about them, but decided to try them out and see how bad they were. i'm sure things could have been worse when we returned the car. fox is another extremely low rate company, but i've actually had a decent experience with them. never would i go within 100 ft of an advantage car rental booth.

As usual, amazing food with good service.  I think they have some of the best wings in the valley. They always come hot, and their golden hot is quite the unique flavor. We only go when they have specials, particularly the burger special, which for $6.50 is a serious amount of food.  The only problem was the fact that we ordered wings, and we expected to get a dozen but got only 10. So we thought that maybe we only ordered 10. We looked at the menu and saw no mention of how many wings you got for $8. That's the only reason I took off a star. Other than that we got a ton of greesy, tasty food for $15. Can you beat that?

After a long day of busting my ass I wanted to find a place where I can unwind by indulging my taste buds. I have a few spots near Tempe that are trustworthy when it comes to fulfilling my desires, but its always better to expand your circle of friends. I decided to do just that.  Mexican food, pizza, burgers are all great, but sometimes you just want something that's not run of the mill. I wanted gyros, but like I said I wanted to try something new because I've been to Haji Baba far too many times and Phoenicia is a bit too pricey for me.  A gyro sandwich plus fries for $5.99 sounded like a really good deal...except that the gyro was very sub par. I was expecting something that was sliced fresh off the rotisserie, and instead got what seemed to be frozen meat cooked on a grill. If I wanted that stuff, I could have made it at home. Thanks for the offer, but I don't think I will be coming here again.  The food wasn't completely inedible, and the service was certainly pretty good. That's probably the only reason I gave it a 2 star rating. I'm not into hookah, and I don't mind the smell, but it didn't add to the experience. Although, if for some ridiculous reason I did want to smoke hookah, this place seemed pretty cool because it looks like they are the hookah kings of Tempe, never seen that many hookahs in my life.  I don't think I will be returning here. Probably better off trying Haji Baba or Phoenica.

I used to go to this place ALL the time in high school. I would go there for lunch almost every other day, and grab burritos for myself and friends (about 20 burritos LOL). Back then it was great, and it was consistent. The thing that drove me nuts about this place was the salsa. Very cilantro-ish and it did a great job on your nasal cavity.  Carne asada fries, egg potato cheese burrito, barbacoa burrito, and the carne asada burrito are all very good. My all-time favorite is the $18, eggs potato cheese. VERY GOOD. this is my standard for breakfast burritos everywhere else I go.  The only reason I give this place a 4-star is because recently the salsa has been very inconsistent. One day I went and the salsa was extremely watery and gross. The chips are consistently gross, but what good is that without amazing salsa. They moved like 20 feet, and the new place is much nicer, but the food quality has gone down a bit. Last night my GF and I went close to closing time, and we didn't get very good food. The steak was more like barbacoa, and the potatoes were more like mashed potatoes (we got a steak potato cheese for my GF). Not very appealing.  This place used to be a staple for me, and I wouldn't think twice about going there. But recently, I don't know what has happened. The old lady that works there is very nice, but I just don't know what is going on to what used to be my favorite non-chain mexican food place in phoenix.  *sigh* I hope they find their consistency again. For a place to be 5-stars for me, it HAS to be consistent. Right now, its lacking.

My fiancee is going to be EXTREMELY upset. I came here sort of by accident, but if it worked out, how can I complain?  My first Chicago-style food experience was in a small hidden place in Tucson during my undergrad years. My fiancee and I went every Wednesday for wings. Having moved away from Tucson, we have been constantly searching for similar style food.  I just found it, and my fiancee is all the way in Taiwan right now.  For me, one of the particularly unique and amazing Chicago-style dishes are their hot wings. They don't use the boring old "Frank's Hot Sauce", they have their own proprietary blend that seems to have the perfect blend of spicy and savoriness. While most places use 100% Frank's, which is a little too vinegary for me, this place has their own unique style. Seriously, their wings are really good.  Wings are no good without pizza, so I ordered a slice of cheese pizza too. Again, very unique pizza. The crust was extremely unorthodox, giving the pizza a "new-car feel" to it. The sauce was also a bit on the sweet side, but overall, everything played out in perfect harmony.  To top off some really good food, the service is really nice as well. Very helpful people over here that genuinely care if you enjoyed your meal.  I'm really excited to go back and try some of their other food. I seriously can't tell you how excited I am that I found this place. Life is going to be much better now.

As someone who moved from Phoenix to Boston, it has become impossible to find a place like FIliberto's here. Appreciate what you all have in Phoenix. There is no review I could write to explain the sorrow that I have for leaving behind Filibertos. I don't want to live without Filibertos...  Seriously though, appreciate the awesomeness while you still live in Arizona.

Cheap, good, "Hawaiian" food.   Until this place opened, there were really only a few choices for "Hawaiian" food. Roy's Hawaiian Fusion is an interesting option, but you begin to lose interest when you see the prices on the menu. This place serves as an amazing, cheap alternative.  Okay, maybe its not your cheap $5-7 lunch, its just a tad bit more depending on what you get. I got the combo entree which had shrimp and chicken, rice, and a small salad. Before I talk about the food, let me reiterate my hate for seafood and shrimp. I just don't like it for some reason. This place's shrimp is one of the few places I will eat shrimp. Its the seasoning that makes the texture of shrimp bearable for me. Likewise, the chicken also has a really unique taste. If you want tingly taste buds and want something unique, try this place out. Service is good, food is interesting, and you get quite a bit of food for what you pay.

I was really tempted to try this place because they have gyro meat available as a pizza topping. I remember having a gyro pizza once and it was heavenly. So, I decided to give this place a try. The first time I had a gyro pizza from here it was really amazing and made me feel nostalgic. I remember my uncle worked at a pizza parlor and hooked it up with some bomb gyro pizza. However, I think this place hasn't quite figured out how to make a gyro pizza.  The pizza itself is decent. For me, the sauce is nothing special and the crust is too biscuity. I feel like I'm eating a deep dish pizza due to the texture of the crust, but clearly its more of an NY style pizza. Its just weird. There was plenty of cheese and they didn't skimp on the toppings. Then what's my issue? Well, I think what happened was that they just put some gyro meat on a pizza and let it cook into the pizza. The cheese already leaves some oil in the pizza after it cooks, and the addition of gyro meat oil really doesn't make a pizza better. This problem becomes exponentially more important if you eat the pizza for leftover. Its just plain gross then. I had a few slices, and got a little tired because the gyro flavoring was overcoming the pizza.  I'm really sad because I wanted to discover a place that made a good gyro pizza. Unfortunately, the one thing that made this place unique and that could have made it stick out from the rest is something that has not quite been perfected at this restaurant. The pizza is really mediocre without the gyro topping, and mediocre pizza is not appealing at all. I feel like this is a really nitpicky review, but I had a pizza without gyro topping and it was just plain jane.

Some friends decided to get lunch here, and I wasn't too excited because it just didn't look that good at all. But in America, majority rules, and I had to go...  I'm not really into expensive places for lunch, and my threshold is about $7-8. Almost everything here was $9+ for lunch, except their special "Blazin Steak". It came with a drink, some pretty good steak, a side of some balls of rice and a side of macaroni. While the steak was pretty tasty, the macaroni was really plain and the rice was just plain boring. Even with additional "teriyaki" sauce I was bored.  To make things worse, they couldn't remember whose order was whose. It took about 5 minutes to figure out everything when they started bringing out food. A girl at our table got food she didn't even order, and then had to wait 10 minutes to get the right order. This place is clean, the service is debatable, but for me the food is kind of bland. Don't think I will be trying this place again.

I really don't expect a whole lot when I go to places like these. Someone without a real business plan somehow got a whole boatload of money and opened up a little store. I can name a dozen of these hole-in-the-wall, ethnic food restaurant grocery stores. Some of them do it real well (Haji Baba and Princess), others seem to have a little trouble (I-Mart).  Zam Zam certainly isn't a place that I would recommend buying your grocery.The meat appears to be a day or two old sometimes, and it just left out overnight sometimes. You can tell by the way the meat looks, its super obvious. Besides all that, I'm not exactly the kind of person that will go out of my way to buy 'zabiha' meat instead of grocery store meat. The rest of the stuff is pretty much as you'd expect. Plenty of spices, drinks, and arabic breads to fulfill your needs. But still, the meat isn't of the highest quality.  Customer service? What customer service? You must not have been to many of these types of places. Don't expect customer service at these places.  It sounds ridiculous that I'm giving this place 4 stars, and it actually is somewhat crazy. Zam Zam makes some AMAZING naan. I wasn't even expecting it, but the naan is simply amazing. At $1.50 its a little pricey, but you get quite a large piece. I don't think its cheaper anywhere else in the valley (or maybe the western US)? I've eating naan at plenty of revered Indo-Pak restaurants on the west coast and I must say I am absolutely in love with the naan. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for their samosas which are a little too salty for my taste. The lack of a sweet chutney certainly doesn't help, and the cilantro chutney is a little too far from classic for my taste. I haven't tried anything besides the naan and samosas, so I can't say too much about those. But even if the other food is only semi decent, the naan will definitely make up for it.  I might be wrong, but the naan might be from heaven.

Listen, I've written enough reviews about the many Filiberto's across the valley that I would be regurgitating old stuff over and over again. Seriously though, I've been to about 5 of them in AZ, and after moving to Boston I'm kind of hoping that AZ might be willing to donate me a Filiberto's.   There is nothing like it anywhere. I used to be skeptical about this place, but then I tried it, and I've been addicted since. Sadly enough, because of my closed mind, I only got to have it for the last 3 out of the 22 years I was in Phoenix.  If you're a snob who likes to eat arugula salads with steamed fish or some other healthy food, don't come here. If you're a Chipotle snob, don't come here. Don't get me wrong, I love Chipotle, but Filiberto's is just different.

I hate to be the only male giving this place a 5 star. I suppose it brings out the feminine side in me.  I digress, I tend to enjoy ice cold milk with oreos or chocolate chip cookies as a snack or dessert. However, this place has something special going on.  The flavors have all been perfected with the right amount of sweetness, flavor, and texture. I really can't find any flaw in their frozen yogurt. My personal favorites are acai berry, cookies and cream (surprise), and new york cheesecake. My girlfriend will be upset if I didn't mention red velvet, its her favorite. Even though I hate the idea of eating taro, even the taro isn't a bad flavor. If you need some fruits to make it more nutritious you can add those too.  I seriously can't stress how unique the flavors are and how immaculate the taste is. The pricing is pretty reasonable as well. For about $3 my GF and I seem to be able to satisfy our sweet tooth. If we're near ASU we usually top off a dinner or lunch with Yogurtland.  I'm not a big fan of frozen yogurt. It seems to be the trending dessert these days along with red velvet. I'm sure both frozen yogurt and red velvet have existed for years, its only recently that I've seen both these things EVERYWHERE. Seriously though, many of the frozen yogurt shops that come to mind have just recently opened within the last 2-3 years.  I suppose some places ride the trend, but this place sets the trend.

I like this place. I struggled between giving them a 3 or 4, but I think they deserve a 4.  naan is good - 5 tandoori chicken - 5 kabobs and stuff -3 qorma/tikkas - 4 Service - 4  Its good food. Not too spicy, the naan is fresh. The one thing to look out for with Indian food places is not the spicy stuff that will kick you while you are eating it, but the stuff with tons of garam masala that will make you feel remorseful after you ate the buffet. I think this place stays well clear of that line for their own benefit.  I'm really not feeling the decorations, the place is a little cramped due to the chairs and tables.  Desserts, I don't know, I didn't really fall for them. I'm a picky Indian, and I only eat a few desserts which Indus chooses not to have.  good place for indo/pak food.

This whole store seems like something you'd see on Food Network. I'm serious, when I walked in I felt like Bobby Flay or Guy was going to be inside. The place is a little flamboyant, but if you're here for cupcakes then what does that say about yourself?  But, I'm not flamboyant. My significant other was craving some red velvet cupcake so we wanted to give this place a try. The prices are somewhat laughable. I guess this place is like the Chipotle of cupcakes? I didn't get to order, but from what I saw you could sort of customize your cupcake. The quality was definitely evident and the cupcakes also tasted pretty fresh. We got red velvet and vanilla latte. Both were pretty good, but I'm not exactly a cupcake fan and I think I'm allergic to too much frosting. The cake itself was really moist and had a nice texture, and the frosting wasn't too bad either.  As for the prices, well, one cupcake will run you ~$3, and a dozen is about $30 after tax. If you want to give someone a birthday gift or something at work then I suppose you can grab half a dozen of these. I think it would run around ~$16. They look fantastic, taste okay, and can definitely cheer you up.  *I HATE Cupcake Wars. When that show comes on, I flip channels*

Against the the recommendation of my friend, Steven G., who has already wrote a review, I headed down to this place to try it out.   My significant other was extremely excited to try this place out, specifically, the Italian beef. I must say, I was pretty excited too. The service was really good, they all seemed very nice, even the cook was asking us how the food tasted. That's nice of them. B1G1 coupon w/purchase of 2 drinks and cheese comes out to $15 still...umm, pointless to use a coupon, I don't drink soda anyways.  The burger was delicious, well the beef patties were. I got a double, and this place totally reminded me of Johnny Rockets, but the patties were definitely nice and big. I think its like $6+tax for a double which is a good value, but the fries are ~$2, and its just frozen crinkle cut fries it seems like. This must be a joke, crinkle cut fries are what you get at the school/university cafeterias. I was hoping for something a little bit more unique here. The fries were well done, but I don't its worth getting them. They have this special "fry sauce" or "Lobby" sauce. Its a unique recipe, and my significan other was raving about it while we were eating. Yeah, it was pretty good, but it doesn't make up for average fries. It does add some flavor to the burgers, and the cold crisp vegetables definitely deserve a ton of praise. However, the bottom bun was super soggy. Just plain old, super soggy. The burger patties were just ridiculously greesy, its good to a certain point, but when the grease is owning your buns, you need to cut back.  The Italian beef? I heard some guy that was ordering saying it was the best in the valley. I laughed. By the time my significant other got to the sandwich the bread had seemed like it had been drenched in water. It sort of reminded me of a hot dog eating competition, just dunk your bread in the water. Fail. Unfortunately, this was just a disappointment. I was astonished how this could happy. Seriously, I just wasn't sure how you could mess up that bad. Its a shame, because I know the cook cared how the food tasted. I really wanted a tasty Italian beef, but I guess it wasn't in my destiny.  Lobby seems like a cool guy, and maybe this was an off day or something. But I have to be fair, I want to give this place a higher rating, though I can't say it is warranted at the moment.

Downright awesome and extremely hip. A non-traditional, very out there, but very hidden coffee joint.  You can't see this place from the street. It's kind of behind the Buffalo Exchange. It's almost the last place you would expect to find a coffee shop. As soon as you walk in there are really bright and vivid paintings, this is kind of what makes it way out there. Barista was very friendly and asked us how the weather was, always cool to have some small talk instead of the drone, "what can i get for you..." Wait, that basically sounds like the boring coffee-grinders at Starbucks.  I gotta have my lattes. I will drink regular coffee sometimes, but my soft spot is a well made latte. Amazing enough, places like Starbucks just don't know how to make lattes, I give up on Starbucks. Their beans suck, and apparently their frothing machines do too, because everytime I go there it seems like they just warm my milk and mix it with some coffee. The latte here was PERFECT. The milk was perfectly frothy, which in my opinion is what makes a latte a latte. Coffee had a nice roasted flavor to it. Amazingly, there are tons of coffee shops out there that can't do decent lattes. This is my new coffee place.  Good music choice here, its like new age elevator music, calm soothing hip hop and pop. Awesome atmosphere, quiet enough to study and have a conversation, yet lively enough to come for just a cup of caffeine. Skip the Starbucks and "Sex in the City" sorority girl drinks and come here.  Only problem was that I think they only have small or large lattes, and it was like $4 for a large. That's like $0.50 to a $1 too much in my honest opinion. Oh well, I think I'd still pay that when I'm craving a latte.

The only time I've actually been here I didn't get anything. But then I came to find out that they had catered some food for an occasion.  I'll be straight with you. Their 'flaming kabob' or whatever is amazing. Seriously, its a visual piece of art. I aspire to have sear marks like they do on their kabobs when I grill. I'm not kidding each kabob is visually appealing, has perfect sear marks, and looks like a clone of its brother. They also taste very good, perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of spices. However, for some reason every time I get to try their kabobs, they tend to be a little dry. This could be due to the fact that I always get their kabobs when it is catered at some event. I won't take off too many points for that, but I can't state that the kabob is perfect for the same exact reason.  The rice and hummus is pretty good as well. I'm not really into ride personally, but their yellow raisin rice is quite fantastic. When you couple it all with some hummus, everything sticks together well to complete the meal. I'd say its well worth a try.  Since I have been there once, but eaten the food many times, I will note that the place lacks decent decorations and has average service. That shouldn't take away too much from the experience though.

I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about. If you don't want to spend $9 for 'Asian' food next door from Genghis grill and you're near the movie theatre come here. This is actually a relaxing break from Panda Express. I cringe every time I think of Panda Express.  This is a review about Yum Yum, don't get me wrong, but let me tell you why you should come here instead of Panda. Practically everything at Panda is dipped in some cornstarch concoction and fried. That leaves for a large volume of your meat being starch. This place is awesome, because they don't do that crap. The mongolian beef is all beef and plenty of vegetables. The mandarin chicken is less fatty than Panda, at Panda the chicken is fairly fatty. Anyways, I like this place a lot for the reasons I've already listed. The taste doesn't overwhelm you like it does at Panda. Yeah, Panda is good the first three times you try it, after that its rather bland and maybe even gross.   Service here was excellent. Came in, got a smile, got my food, they were willing to do half chow mein, half rice. Awesome. Pricing is good, thus, value is good. Its a little too Pandy Express ish, everything looks like Panda, it tastes better though. If they could get a little creative and invdividual, they'd be 5 stars.

I didn't get a chance to try the food here because they weren't serving any food when I went. Lets see, Summer 2010, FIFA World Cup. Robbie Fox was one of the few guys willing to open up his shop at 5:30 for soccer. Awesome.  We just ordered a few drinks, and watched the game it was Netherlands vs Sweden I think, and there were some crazy dutch guys there. Made the atmosphere pretty cool. Nice place to catch a game.  Apparently there was gonna be food here when they opened, but there never was. It was a perpetual waiting game, and it was always like, "yeah, the food/cook is gonna be here in 5 minutes". Eventually, the game ended and yeah, no food. Poor customer service in my opinion, if you say there is gonna be food there should be food. I'll try it some other time if I get the chance.

I've pretty much already reviewed the Venezia's in Tempe, but uhh, this place is just too good. The fact that they have multiple locations is even better. This one is right next to my significant other's house so I can pretty much hit his place up at any time. Essentially it is a staple to our diet. Imagine what would happen if the slaves didn't have cornmeal, or asians didn't have rice, or the Irish didn't have potatoes. Ok?

While I'm not buying the whole yogurt fad, I will admit there are some pretty good yogurt places around town. Yogurt is good when its done right, and when there are some 'exotic' flavors to try. Acai berry from yogurtland is absolutely one my all-time favorites. But then you have places like this which focus on mediocrity.  I'm not trying to bash on this place, but if you've been to both Yogurtland (near ASU) and Zoyo you'd be confused as to where you were. I'm not even joking. The yogurt cups look exactly the same sans the logo, and the dispensing machines look the same to the tee, including the cool LCD screens above them. I think the only difference between this place and Yogurtland is that this place has mediocre flavors.  Flavors...that's pretty much the only thing that matters when it comes to frozen yogurt. While its awesome to have the basics, this place seemed to play it too safe. If I want plain vanilla and chocolate yogurt I think I'll just go to McDonald's and get an ice cream cone. The only thing this place excelled at was a plethora of toppings. I would have to say there are over 3-4 dozen different toppings. I suppose if you want a large variety of toppings then this place isn't a bad idea. However, if you're trying to eat healthy (what's the point of eating yogurt if you're not?) then what's the point of toppings?  I can understand how such a coincidence could occur, both franchises probably use the same exact supplier. This just makes things confusing. It's like having to pick between Honda and Toyota. Both are 'Japanese' cars manufactured in the US, and have comprable features. It comes down to personal preference. You have to take each for a test drive and figure out what works best for you.

Terrible Indian food. I'm Indian, so by my standards, this place is terrible.  First, the selection is very skewed. Only chicken? The owner's religious preference is pretty apparent here, and mine probably is too, but c'mon, can I get some beef? I'll be honest though, the chicken dishes that were there were pretty decent. naan is good, and they actually have some good dessert available for their buffet. the food isn't that bad. mango lassi is decent as well, but it wasn't cold, and that was a big turn off.   if there is one dish that exemplifies indian food it is the tandoori chicken. this place failed with that dish. ok, you can bring it to me on a sizzling plate, that's cool and all, but it better be tasty. the tandoori wasn't spicy and it was VERY lemony. huge turn off. tandoori has a distinct flavor that can be ruined by too much lemon. i thought this was a one time thing, so i ordered another...  FAIL. owner who was taking our order said we couldn't order more than 1 round of chicken. hmm...i thought i came for the buffet? this was a HUGE fail. sorry, but if you aren't going to give me unlimited tandoori chicken, don't call this a buffet. "we usually don't do reorders on tandoori chicken for buffet, but i will let you this time". what kind of service is that?  the servers are kind and nice, naan is brought out fairly promptly.  all in all, this place has some huge flaws that give it the 1 star rating. first off, i've never been to an indian food place that didn't have all you can eat tandoori chicken. i just can't stress this enough, i was SO shocked when i heard this. then, the way the owner told me really turned me off. second, the mango lassi wasn't cold. if you're mango lassi isn't cold, its like getting a warm milk shake or a warm smoothie. third, the all chicken dishes really isn't very appealing. some beef qorma or something would be a great addition. there is much better stuff in phoenix, keep looking, stay away.

What an absolute disgrace of an establishment. But what was I expecting going to a place called "America's Taco Shop"?  As soon as you walk into this place it smells like crap. The entrance is right next to the bathroom, but even the dining area isn't far enough to suppress the smell of feces permeating from the bathroom.  We were already determined to try out the tacos at this place, so we gave it a shot anyways.   Originally, we had seen the sign for $1 tacos during happy hour. Just so happens to be that we were there at happy hour. However, the person taking our order informed us that only tacos al pastore (pork tacos) were available. Thanks for mentioning that on the sign. Still though, I was determined to give it a try as my significant other hesitated.  We decided on the carne asada burrito, its almost impossible to mess this up, right? Wrong, unfortunately this place messed it up real bad. First, the food is mediocre. Compared to a place like Filibertos, which doesn't have special food but rather generous portions for a fair price, this place is an absolute rip-off. I probably should have read Larry's review before hitting this place up.  I could have bought FOUR of these burritos at $6.50 a piece, and it still wouldn't beat Filiberto's or Chipotle. In fact, if you gave me FOUR burritos from here for the price of $6.50, then I'd STILL go to Chipotle or Filiberto's. Anyway you do the math, it just doesn't add up. Portions are too small, place smells like crap, and food is mediocre at best.

Stay away from this place.   Let's see, the bulgogi was terrible, and extremely overdone. Customer service was horrible, I had to wait 15 minutes before I could order. When the owner's wife finally came out, she seemed to be in a bad mood because she didn't smile at all. Lame.  If you come here you will QQ.

I desperately needed a haircut and didn't want to travel too far. Thanks to Yelp, I found Rafael at A & B Barbershop who did an amazing job on my hair.  What really brought me into the door was the $15 price that included a straight razor shave. On the east coast a similar haircut would cost well over $20 and then you'd have to include tips and stuff. I asked for a fade on the side with a #1 and a combover on the top with a hot shave on the sides. Rafael was pretty detailed with everything and communicated throughout the haircut making sure everything was done to my exact tastes. One of the best parts was being able to leave and go home without having to toss my shirt in the laundry because there is hair all over. Let's face it, we all know that this can happen sometimes, at best its super annoying, and at worse it makes you feel like crap after your haircut. I can't recommend these guys enough. Everyone else that was getting their haircut was also extremely pleased.  I usually dislike getting my haircut mostly because I don't want to pay $25-30 (on the east coast), and as a result I only go once every 6-7 weeks when I should be going every 4-5 weeks. The prices and service here make it so that I should be coming as often as possible.

Self-serve frozen yogurt seems to be this new crave that is all over the valley. Some places do it extremely well, and others are just plain mediocre, and soemtimes bad.  Lots of unique flavors here, however, my fiancee was a little upset that there was no red velvet. I just discovered moshi, and it is quite possibly the most amazing thing ever. Moshi is kind of like marshmallows, but as someone who only eats kosher I try to avoid eating marshmallows from outside. Moshi is an excellent substitute, and it really goes well with ANY yogurt flavor.  The one thing I have to comment on is the strawberries here which were very, very ripe. Most other places seem to just throw any kind of strawberries into their yogurt line, but Yogurtology happened to have some really good calories.  Its a super clean store, and the decorations are definitely very unique. The only thing that keeps me from giving Yogurtology a 5-star is the price, at 45 cents an ounce its slightly more than the Yogurtland I'm used to near ASU campus.

Definitely thought I had reviewed this place before. But I guess not...  I had tried their catering before, and it was pretty good. So I decided I would try their restaurant food.  Bad idea. I ordered chicken tikka masala and got chicken tikka soup. The masala that was there was super watered down, and the chicken was a mix of white meat and brown meat, some of the brown meat was so tough that I had to leave a few pieces of the chicken uneaten. The naan was really good, but the chicken tikka masala was very sub par. To make matters worse, it cost a whopping $7. When $7 gets you much more food at other places, I doubt you are going to venture back here. I suppose it was worth a try, but its not worth the return.

I'm surprised I don't have a review written for this place. I definitely remember walking in after getting a coupon handed to me while my fiance and I were right outside the theatre. Being the extremely hungry people that we are, we decided to give Axxio Pizza a shot. We had previously already been to Slices, and figured that Axxio probably wasn't going to be all that different. Actually, we were wrong. Not because either of them are better, but because Axxio was just as bad as slices despite having a lot of cool options.  The have really interesting topping combinations that result in a pizza that looks, sounds, and tastes really good on paper, but in reality the execution is poor. I would much rather prefer traveling to Venezia's to get pizza, or skipping the pizza altogether and getting Chipotle or Yum Yum's if I am at the movies. Sorry, but this slice isn't for me.

TL;dr Same price as Hungry Howies, but better pizza just by a little  I always pass by this place because I take the light-rail. At some point I decided that I should probably check it out on Yelp, and if the reviews are positive I would make a quick visit here.  Thanks Yelp! If I didn't read some of the positive reviews, I probably would have never stopped by what sounds to be a sketch pizza place next to Food City. I think Big Jimmy's stole "mucho sabor" (lots of flavor) from Food City and put it all into their pizza. It was great, especially for $5.  More topppings than Hungry Howies, a healthy amount of greese, and a perfectly well-done crust make Big Jimmy's my new favorite $5 large pizza. I'd say that HHs and BJs are very close, except HHs crust is always a slight task to eat, where as BJs crust was very soft and more enjoyable to finish.  Of course, I might have to go to HHs just because my friends might not want pizza from a place that sounds so sketch. Its not sketch, its just amazing pizza.
