why hello there, hole in the wall; that's not really a hole in the wall, except for the food.....delicious! i love the tacos durados (fried tacos-chicken) and their rice is just like mama makes it. the photos below do not do the food justice. don't go during lunch unitl after 1pm or you'll have slow service, everything is cooked up fresh....the salsas are hot hot hot. love it!

hmmm, never knew that TGIF's was less expensive than Applebees as the quality of food is much nicer at TGIF's. yesterday me and my girls went to happy hour at Applebees in hopes of finding some good inexpensive appetizers to go with some tasty cocktails. our visit was on to a great start, as our server took care of us like we were in a 5 star restaurant. he was so awesome; he should have been in a tux and bow tie.   the cost for our drinks and food totaled $41.00 for 3 apps and 7 drinks which isn't bad for happy hour, but a few weeks ago we went to TGIF's for happy hour and ended up with 4 apps, and 2 rounds of specialty cocktails for 3 of us and the bill was under $30. all the appetizers were served at half mass, or at least half the portion served by TGIF's. the potato skins were so greasy not even the sour cream could make it go down smoothly. i did enjoy the spinach and artichoke dip, but the greasy chips were a little too much. kinda funny that the buffalo wings weren't greasy at all. my fav's were the spinach dip and the wings. the spinach dip was served in a kettle pan and there were big chunks of artichoke in it. the chips tasted freshly made but were a little greasy for my liking.  i'll give them another try, but next time it's only wings for me!

I have to say i'm quite saddened that i had to choose 1 star; as i was so looking forward to finding a new fav along Camelback rd. my sister and i headed to Rosie Mc Caffreys (sp), but turned off at SunUp Brewing Co. by default; we had to stop in because we were both starved and the menu offered Corned Beef and cabbage, plus we still had about 6 streets to go.   we stepped inside to a "please wait to be seated" sign, so we waited, and waited (as several wait staff passed and looked our way without even a nod of acknowledgement) for about 5 minutes. finally our server approached us and offered inside or patio (we chose patio of course!) she was very nice at first seating and asked for our drink order. since neither of us partake in the appreciation for micro brews, we chose raspberry ciders. we were happy. the crowd was sparse-but present. the weather was fabulous.   it was a weird set-up with 3 small rooms (patio in between both) and no room to turn around. there was no reason our server should have been perturbed; other than having to maneuver around tables inside, as she hardly had tables. none the less, when she returned with our beers, she plopped them down hard on the table and stormed off. the beers were served lukewarm but we tried to drink them anyways.   she returned a few minutes later for our order. since it was a toss up between the Corned beef and cabbage & the Fish n chips, i asked the servers opinion, inquiring if the corned beef was sliced thin, of to which she replied "it isn't sliced thin"-but it was sliced thinner than a nickel, plus the meal wasn't even served with bread or butter; but back to the ordering....  after she took our order, i asked her for 2 cold pint glasses; since the beers were warm (only the bottle was slightly cold). she brought back glasses with ice and straws, pounced them on the rod iron table and went on to tell me why micro brews aren't served in cold pint glasses, saying she didn't have any chilled pint glasses because this is a micro brewery.   it wasn't until after her lecture on the creation of beer, that i explained that even if there is a right way to serve-some people do request chilled pints. i explained that i wasn't a beer afficionado, i just wanted to drink my beer the way it should be served "chilled" she gave me attitude, walked away and then returned with two cold pint glasses, pouncing them on the table as she uttered "here these are for our Root Beer" while she turned on her heels to run.   the rest of the meal was pleasant, as she was hardly available. the only time i seen any of the female servers was when an assumingly wealthy man was spotted, that was when most of the servers would approach and hug them (much to close by restaurant standards) very tightly. however most tables around us were either taken by lesbians or hetero females so the ladies weren't hoovering around us too much.    we received the credit card bill to sign, which was also plopped off mid walkaway. the tables are patio tables with holes, so most people with common sense would prepare for the signing of the bill with a hard bottom of some sort, but not here! they are all consumed with the spotting of rich men and instructions for micro brewing that they don't have time to serve or be of assistance, so be prepared to either pay them upfront to be treated like a patron, or flash your directors card because they seem to think this is suddenly Scottsdale.   on to the food. i tasted my sisters fish and chips and the homemade chips were soggy from the fish. the halibut was delicious although sister had to pull off all the breading, because it was as thick as an Indian popover. they did serve it with spicy ketchup which was surprisingly delicious. my corned beef cabbage was served paper thin, without bread or butter; but it was still very tasty. the red potatoes soft and the carrots & cabbage blanched to perfection. next time i'll just try sitting at the bar.

i just finished a two year lease at the Heritage. honestly the only reason we stayed so long is that we were on the 3rd floor!!!! moving was a b---ch. the kitchen photo is the same as our units exactly. the dishwasher sucks big time! the pigeons overtake your balcony too.  this place is not built very well, they are constantly having blackouts and they do not compensate for lost food or anything (however one time they did put us up at a hotel). there is no bike rack and you cannot leave your bikes chained anywhere outside your apartment. the security gates are always stuck open, so anyone can come in. several of the residents are continual beggars and bummers of cigarettes and coins who loiter around the mail boxes.  however i loved the pool area; as hardly anyone ever used it while i was there. i did have some great pool parties, but there isn't a restroom by the pool, so it was a constant hike upstairs for the loo.   the windows are so thin, that you hear each passing wind, bird and rattle from your neighbors doors closing shut. i would not recommend this place unless you can deal with the blackouts, beggars and continual shake of the window. if your an east coaster, this might be the place for you; because you can hear everything your neighbor is doing in their place too!

One of my all time favs!!! Its always good, but the service always lacks desire. This is one place that requires a good 2 hour serving for dinner, so be prepared. For lunch you can be out in an hour, but you will have to keep on top of the server for your check and then begg them to take payment! They slack big time in this sense, not sure why.   But the food is always fresh and very delicious, not to mention very affordable. I love the sushi, although not a big variety, they always have fresh stuff and very tasty. I have a few favorite rolls and love the penne al arrabiatta. I used to make homemade arrabiatta all the time, but haven't in years because theirs tastes soooooo yummmy! This place is great for dates, long converstaions and those who need to stretch their time together. Everything is wonderful and you will be pleasantly surprised with the beautiful decor in a strip mall..... you'll feel like you have entered another land, once you walk thru thems doors, because its so cute and quaint, not what you'd expect. Go try this place you'll love it!!!

Really? a chiropractor that actually cares about the cliental and not getting rich? unheard of! i've been under chiropractic care since about 1989 when my cousins VW got pummeled by a vehicle comitting an illegal left turn over the I-17fwy. I was 18yrs old and it hit me like a ton of bricks a couple days after the accident, i was in pain; the worse kind! i began seeing a chiropractor and was treated to complete pain free movement yay!   Fast forward to today, after several auto accidents, falling off my rollerblades, being thrown down by a pebble in my heeleys and of course life as a fluttering butterfly; i had to revisit a chiropractor.   First one was in the town and country. It was just okay, but the doc's not very savvy on the treatment of clients and he runs the show himself (which might explain the $75 adjustments-i had several too many!) he lets his east coast attitude guide him so it's not a great thing.   Second came the chiropractor on Osborn rd and 3rd st. i had to visit that chiropractor because of a sideswipe. the auto insurance for the other car was picking up the tab, on a lien; so i didn't bother to check out the prices, that is until i was told that after 2 weeks the allocated $1500 was almost used up. I had to stop and think; 3 days a week, 10 minutes with the massuese and 5 minutes with the doctor adjusting me, plus 2 stupid tests that could have easily been performed by hand= over $1300 already!) i almost laughed in their face, but later realized that was why they never had cars in the parking lot. They had the nerve to charge $1500 for 3.5 weeks of chiropractic care.    Lastly my transmission died on my car while i was driving 25 mph and it felt like a hit a brick wall. I gave myself whiplash, one of the worst kinds. Luckily a friend suggested the Inner Health Chiropractic. they were very professional, courteous and reasonable! Only $65 for an initial evaluation which includes xray's. But here's what got me the doc said "my fees are on a slidding scale whatever you can afford from $15-60 is good. And everytime i walk up to the window to pay, they charge me $15. i've been giong for 3 weeks now and my neck is almost back to par. I'm in heaven knowing that i can keep up the adjustments even when i'm all better, because continual maintenence is the key....obviously the docs at Inner Health Chiro know and understand that, plus they have huge hearts!

I  had the same experience as John V in that there was only one person working and "She was cooking, bartending, handling money, scratching her head, shaking hands, cleaning bar tops, running dishes, etc.... read more »did I mention she did not wash her hands once during this whole time? We ate our dinners, disgustedly, thinking how an inspector would shut the place down immediately if they saw it. She was entertaining, all over the place, yelling, throwing things, etc." on our day, she was so drunk/on it, that she poured at least half a bottle of wine on our burgers and side of onions, but they were tasty, the most yummy burger and sauteed onions (they ended up purple!) i've ever had. it was so delicious i forgot about how unsanitary the place was...to bad she's the only one who cooks the burgers like that, must be the altered state 'o mind. i'd go back again, after a few drinks.

Wow! talk about roll back prices....$1.75 wells, $3 sky's and half price munchies cost only $3.50. Rest assured the prices are not reflected in the taste at all! We ordered 2 orders of buffalo wings with Armadillo Gold sauce, potato skins, hummus and fried pickles. The wings were delicious, finger tasting good! Except I didn't care for the red onions tossed on top of the wings, easily picked off, but none the less weird! I have never had a buffalo wing served with raw onions, and i'm not about to start (next time i'll ask them to leave them off-i hate to waste food=even if its just a few diced onions). The fried pickles had a delicious breading so i didn't mind that they weren't the true dill pickles i'm used too. The ranch for the pickles was a little runny, but tasty. The potato skins were also very tasty, and best part is there was little to no grease on top because I asked them to leave the bacon off. They were cooked to precision, not dry or over baked what so ever! They sure do know how to served a good drink too. The service was good, we didn't have to wait long for anything. There were a lot of of men due to the off track betting, so you can imagine the lack of women hanging out just for the fun of it. Something about old men smoking cigarettes non-stop checking out the race sheets and pissed of about dropping money in a second keeps women away, but don't let that keep you from trying this place, especially for the Happy Hour!

OMG! what the heck happened to this place? It hasn't even been more than a year since I was there last, and it has totally gone down the drain. the ladies restroom was worse than a truck stop restroom. I've driven coast to coast 4 times, and from CA to AZ a plethora of times and have never been in a bathroom as sick as theres was. Worse part about it was the managers rude reaction. I pointed out the fact that the toilet paper was all wet, making it impossible for anyone to use it and all he did was pile up rolls on the top of the toilet. He didn't even bother asking anyone to clean up the paper droppings; being that the toilet paper was coming off in chunks there must have been at least 20 pieces of toilet paper all over the floor.   I guess that is why the place was dead at midnight on a Friday. The over priced drinks, the horrible toilet paper and the bartender tossing ice all over the bar each time he poured a drink might also have something to do with it.   I'm just saddened that with the influx of new businesses going in across the street, improving the area, this place is going straight downhill. The manager Sunny was a smart A-S when I brought the restroom issue to his attention as well. Guess I shouldn't have expected anything more, especially when the first thing you walk through when you arrive at this bar is a cigarette cloud; as you have to go out front to smoke.   This used to be my favorite spot, but alas the times are a changing!

OMG! this place is so delicious, reviewing it now just makes me wanna go eat their COMBO (Zucchini & Mushroom) w/Ranch=$ 5.25. When i was there, I had the wings in HONEY HOT BBQ (6) =$ 3.99 as well. Someone at our table had a cheese steak, but i didn't taste it; however i did taste a french fry and it was perfect, not greasy. the service was fast and pleasant. i can't believe the quality of the food for the prices. food is fast and fresh! i can't wait to go back! its always busy around sporting time....so plan accordingly.

In all my years eating at Benihana's i have never had as much fun as i did  this last weekend for Greg's birthday. We had dinner at 10:30pm and had the funniest chef ever! It was a long day for all of us and i know i was starvin like marvin. The servers name was Hideo and he was too fun. A little x-rated but not too. He was so subliminal he had all of us rolling. The  server was also gracious and quick. She had us served up very fast. Brought out the delicious miso soup and ginger salad after serving up our drinks. Charles and I had the hot sake, Brian & Greg each had the Asahi beer, i think the ladies had grey goose and soda. Our food was all over the menu. Brian had the Shrimp, Chicken & Filet Mignon while i had the Lobster, & Filet Mignon, Greg had the Shrimp & Chicken, Kristine the same and Charles the Filet Mignon while Tiffany had the Mango Chicken and Alondra the Filet mignon i think as well. Everyone raved about their food. My lobster was divine. The Fillet Mignon was cooked medium rare to perfection! The Benihana vegetables are always my favorite and i totally wish i knew how to order extra! The chef had many more tricks up his sleeve than most Tepan Yaki chefs around town, so i was still captivated by the twirl of his knife. One thing i miss from the NJ Tepan Yaki spot we frequented was the sake in the season bottle slung at us from the other side of the grill. Never the less i love this place and 6 months in between each visit is toooo long! Luckily we had 8 of us in our party because we took over half of the grill. The manager took a photo of our  group for Gregs birthday so you should be able to find it online ^_~.

OMG! who'da thunk that home cooking could be made for the masses day in and day out. this place had rib sticking food and the best lemonade i've had in a while, it was drank in a jar! we arrived about 12:45pm and saw a line outside, when we almost turned away. it wasn't until my friend Dirty Red pointed out all the caucassians standing off yuma and central in the hood, during the hottest part of the day that made me realize this must be a gold spot!  well damn Dirty Red was right! i had the Betty Boop, mac n' cheese and cornbread. my sister the BB too, but with string beans and potatoes (they tasted like they were in a pork broth very tasty). Dirty Red had the biggest meal on the menu and lucky for us, he shared his homestyle potatoes & beans and rice.   the chicken was so moist, while fried to perfection! the waffle was thin with buckwheat (i think) and cinnamon. i'm not usually a waffle fan, but this waffle was amazing. the mac n' cheese was so yummy i literally cleaned my plate (my only complaint was the small serving-but i'm sure they knew it was just the right amount) the homefries were great, fried to a perfect golden brown with perfectly soft potatoes on the inside, they melted in my mouth.   our only  complaint was the bad service (which i really think is only part of the overall dining experience) we were served our drinks at sporadic times, presented with our food and no utensils (i got up to request some, and 5 minutes later Dirty Red had to get up to request some). but ya know what, it wasn't enought to taint my meal...i just picked up my plump chicken breast and went to town, the waffle had to wait.   overall the food is well worth the wait, drive or whatever your obstacle. its the best fried chicken i've had...well..... ever!! go to lolo's you wont regret it!  but first you must find the door, it's off yuma by the misters.   WARNING: i went home and crashed the F'out after eating here, so be prepared.

This place sure is a breath taking theatre in the heart of Phoenix. The restored original paintings on the wall, uncovered by chance, look as amazingly glorious as they would have in its day of creation. I have visited this theatre many a times, and have to say that Stomp was my favorite performance as of yet. However, this past sunday 2/8, the Orpheum Theatre out did itself all in the name of Tuaca. The crowd was enourmous, and as it turned out only 1/3 filled to capacity (yikes, my tight standing room leaves no more room for even a shoulder purse, much less 2/3 more people) however the service was outstanding. They served butler style chicken kieve, caprese bruschetta and roast beef dumplings (forgot the name lol, but they were pretty fancy, schmancy and delicious!). The bar served nothing but Tuaca, an italian liquor that tastes of vanilla and spices, but thankfully it tasted great with everything! I especially liked the Tuaca and cranberry juice and the Tuaca and ginger ale....YUMMY! Since it was Robi's birthday, her and i had a shot of the stuff too and it wasn't half bad. Definitely didn't have a hang over, and with the amount i had, gotta wonder why lol.   The body art show was very entertaining. There were dancers, an aerialist, a violinist and body art. The aerialist was amazing and very exquisite, gracefuly light and capivating.  The butterfly costumes had me at the first flutter, I was smiling the entire time. It kinda felt like I  was in vegas there were such sexy, and some barely there costumes. The stage was very  well used and the lighting was consistent with the aubiance and theme at all times, the music, at times exhilerating, was in tune with the body art, and performances. I'm not sure if this was  travelling crew, but hands off to them and the house for a yelpingly grand time! I felt like a rockstar, the entire house was so happy and helpful, not a bitter soul in site-Gotta love it!  We also found rock star free parking, it doesn't get any better than this, except of course if i ride the train in next time....ooh i see another visit in my near future.

so you'll have to get over the "i'm important, got to work, really busy, snappy dresser, too cool for school (see the old barista "B"'s photo for reference)" type of people that occupy most of the seats at this coffee house, otherwise you will miss out on the best people watching of the valley. if you have been out of touch with society for a while, ie.  been stuck in kansas, under a house; stop in and cop a squat for about 2 hours and i'm sure you will see many a people you thought you'd never ever run into in your life again. they all stop in, if only to be seen. the coffee and the service is not that great, but it beats the last owners crew. about late lunch you will run into lots of overweight men, who are trying to fake business deals with beautiful models, before lunch you will run into the younger crowd trying to get into those fake business deals with overweight men. its a riot what you might see out there on the patio, but at least you will have a big f-ing table to do it from.

oh yeah burger boiee! this place is always a great spot for a yummy burger cooked to perfection. for me, med rare with  some real redness, is only found here and they do it right! not too rare, but definitely very red for the medium and higher temp lovers. i got the standard classic burger with cheddar cheese and i totally forgot to ask for the onions to be grilled, so just lettuce and pickles. this was the best burger i have eaten in a while, and it tastes the same everytime i come back! i did try the sweet potato fries in the mixed basket and  i loved them and the shopping cart they rolled in on. there were 3 of us so we sat at the bar, about 10:30pm on friday and the service was superb! amanda was on task. i had the pear cider and was so enthralled with all the pretty pour toppers, i wanted to try every beer on tap, until i remembered i can't stand the taste of beer that tastes like beer...so there i was with my pear cider, tasting like a pear wine, sitting and starring at the shark, the devil, the animals and all those pretty enticing toppers. it made me feel bold, so i asked for a taste of the white chocolate ale, and yuckie...i was dropped flat down on reality...pooof! i do hate beer that tastes like beer, even if it has a hint of chocolate after taste. next time i come to delux, its all about the dessert menu! i was so full, as usual, that there wasn't room for dessert. but dang nab it! i had to see that there darn menu, and low and behold i couldn't believe my eyes...the delux banana split lava cake will be all mine, next time.

OMG! sushi left on the counter for 30 minutes, then served to us as though it was just made freshly? i think not! the sea eel didn't even look suitable for a photograph, but not wanting to be fussy, i tried it, and quickly spit it out! this place is more of a 1 time visit. i've been several times, and still am not impressed. that was the last try, i hope to never be starved for sushi and stuck by that place again. the service sucks at the bar, it was the bartender who served up the sour sushi too! steer clear from here, you've neen yelped! oh and the big fish tank in the floor? its not all that. although the decor keeps bringing me back-it makes me forget all the previous visits-then i quickly remember when i'm waiting for the sushi.  one things fer sure, if ur looking for all those candy pushers, with the burned out Ed Hardy clothes, plastic booby flashing bleached blondes or euro-transplants looking to do anyone that will get them somewhere, well there you go....because its all there.

$2 tacos is always the best way to get me to try your food!!! Fantastic idea....if only the service, food and prices were as fantastic.  We were a party of 8; but only two of us arrived early. So we sampled the avocado mousse before everyone got there. It was different, creamy and a little cilantro maybe, but something was not right so we ordered the Guacamole that is Hecho en Mexico. It was worse! Mushy frozen avocados with pico de gallo mixed in. The salsa verde was delicious though! The red salsa was just ok. Tasted fresh out of a jar but absolutely loved the chips!   The food was priced much too high for the quality and service. They lack consistency; my first fish taco was served with 4 tiny pieces of fish, and then my second was served with at least 4 times that amount. The fideo was delicious, but the cheese in it was a little too much. I will definitely have to give this place another try, but ouch $12 for enchiladas? Even with the fusion of mexican food I'm having trouble seeing myself there for any other day than $2 tacos day. Especially when the server argues about the bill (even after i asked her to keep my tab separate due to ATM card only). On a much worse note: she tried to leave the charges for 4 bills that had already been paid on our receipt; and balked when we asked for an updated bill. TOO FUNNY.

I so love that Harley's not only kept the old Roman Table feel (Roman Table was named Olivia's before her son bought her out), but after 6 years, their food still tastes like Olivia herself is in the kitchen making the sauces, instead of walking around greeting everyone. The new owners are very helpful and friendly.   They have changed only the few parts of the menu that could use some updating. Like the Gnocchi (Potato dumplings) plate prepared in a cream pesto or a basil rosata sauce (half marinara & half alfredo sauce) for $11.00.  I had the Chicken alla Panna and it was so very delicious. The sauce was light, not too creamy and very delicious. The tender chicken breast was pounded thin then sauteed (but not overcooked-which is hard to do), served with mushrooms & fresh herbs in a brandy  cream sauce. It came with a side of fettuccine alfredo (which was the only -1 star of the evening). The alfredo cream sauce was more like a butter broth and very bland-not one of their best. The plate was a large serving and cost $13.75.   Since I was actually at a Christmas Party (thanks tiffany!) we had a salad and tiramisu as part of our meal. The salad was served with fresh mixed greens, onion (no thanks!), zucchini, carrots and red cabbage. The balsamic dressing wasn't very impressive, but it worked. I added tons of Parmesan cheese to this salad ^_~.  I'm extremely picky about tiramisu since i make a deo one of my own, but this place has it hands down right on the mark. Its so fabulous, not too much liquor & not too sweet. It definitely tasted like the real thing (missing you Chambersburg, Trenton, New Jersey, you were the only reason worth staying! -Its an old Italian Immigrant area famous for the intimate Italian eateries)  I would recommend this place to everyone on every budget because real & affordable Italian food is hard to come by in this town. But please veer away from the fettuccine alfredo (you could probably make a better one at home!)

WOW! Finally a restaurant in the desert that has me head over heels. Location, service, freshness, menu, view, large but intimate dinning room, i can go on! It was Valentines day, our 10th year anniversary-last minute date with this being our 20th choice. They were wide open, no reservations needed. Not only are they located in the Heart and Soul of downtown. It is so close to the new convention center, that several times during the meal I had the urge to reach out and grab the building to pull us closer; as I chose the table closest to the edge on the patio near the convention center and sat right in the center of the table looking out. The view was so breathtaking, I almost forgot we ordered the best appetizer ever! The Classic Sampler included   Roasted garlic prawns over tasty mashed potatoes, teriyaki tenderloin over rice, hot red King crab and artichoke dip served with the tastiest bread sticks. Everything was superb! This could have easily been a meal in itself. We shared a salad at the suggestion of the waiter-expecting a portion that could be shared, but received the smallest-most delicious salad. It was served chopped style (yup this is the real deal when it comes to Chop houses) with a delicious ranch dressing. Next time we will each order our own because i wanted MORE! I didn't mind as it made more room for the bottle of wine (half off on Saturdays for bottles of wine and Champagne-LUCKY us!). I ordered the Grilled North Atlantic Maine Lobster Tails which were served with grilled asparagus, melted butter for dipping and fresh lemon. Brian ordered the Bone in Rib Eye 20 oz. which is Creekstone Farms' premium Black Angus beef, corn fed and aged 28 days for flavor and tenderness. All steaks are grilled and seasoned with custom rub, then topped with steakhouse butter. Served with crispy buttermilk onion strings and red jacket mashed potatoes. It was so delicious I had to copy and paste the menu as this is one restaurant that is sure to be tried even just once. If your a Phoenician or a lover of Phoenix as I, then you can finally be proud to know that downtown Phoenix is the home to one of the Best Chop houses in all of my 16 country travels!!!!

omg! i love this new roller coaster...i mean train. its so much fun. be prepared to move a little if your on the route with curves and not in a seat. i'm an avid roller coaster fan, and hate the fact that there aren't any in town worth talking about, (encanto park has no hills). this is the most beautiful thing to come to phoenix in a long time. in not sad to see the lanes along central filled with metal, eliminating the left turns all together in some parts. as the train is so supper dupper i love it! it's only $2.50 for an all day pass too! just make sure your on it for home before 11am or you'll be left to fend your own ride. people watching is fun on the train too. don't get so caught up or you might miss your stop.

I'm loving this train and all the stations, each with individualized art-mostly pertaining to the stations location. its easy to get on and off. i ride with my bike and unless its middle of rush hour, there is always room for us both.  i've enjoyed it in the morning and the evening, each time arriving at my destination calm and fresh. my favorite part is watching all the people drive by, slower than our train lol.   i just hope that one day there is a metro light rail running down Camelback road thru the biltmore area. ah maybe, if only; one day soon.

How can you not love a place that offers $.75 refills on tea bought at the Fair Trade in the civic space downtown? These two places are great places for treats, tea and friendly service. I rode my bike from the AZFCU to the civic space, grabbed and Ice tea and some gum samples, then biked through ASU to Think. By the time I arrived at the Roosevelt/Central train station i was so parched i went to this Fair Trade, asked them if i could get a refill instead of wasting a cup, thinking i would pay for an entirely new Iced Tea, when she only charged me $.75. that was awesome!!! finally a place that is, well, Fair! they didn't have my favorite Banana Nut cookies, but that's okay i'll forgive them lol.   however if you ever see the banana nut cookies available, get them fast! they are the most tasty & moist little bites of heaven you will ever eat! this place also offers tons of vegan items.   they offer free wi-fi, have inside and outside seating both in front of the shop and in the courtyard right behind it too. ride a bike? you'll find 2 bike racks in front and back as well. you will also find handcrafted items to purchase from around the world, including music-which can be sampled on the sampler close to the courtyard. i can't get enough of their green tea, but the others are deolilcious too and at only $2.25, with a $.75 refill you can't go wrong. so next time you take the train into downtown, stop at the roosevelt/central station and get yourself some Fair Trade on!

This place is so accommodating that they allowed our meet-up group to watch the Victoria's Secret fashion show on the big screen last night! Talk about service. The service was also spot on. I ate before I arrived, so didn't eat there...but my friends did and the food looked fresh and delicious! They have 2 pool tables (lack of brush to clean off all the debris on the pool table prevented me from giving them 5 stars), tons of TV and lots of room.   We had the only table with females, which was typical for this type of bar i guess. The servers were dressed in stuff that may have been seen on the VS fashion show!   The prices are very reasonable too! Will definitely be back for the food ^_~

while i have to agree with those of you who said this place stank before, i was there tonight and either the smell is gone or my nose was plugged up without my knowledge. i was there for scottsdale fashion week and the place was taken over by some fashion knock off's (at fashion week? come on, gimme a break!), lots of blinged out "Ed" style clothes & accessories and stuff that had nothing to do with fashion (realtors association? organic meat distributors?) i guess that kinda gives you the idea of just who this area is trying to attract...

They get 3 stars for me for the tasty treats and 1 more for being so charitable. For my 10 yr business anniversary we did a big hair donation to Locks of Love (11 ponytails). Sprinkles helped out by donating over $400 worth of cupcakes for our event without batting an eyelid. I hadn't tasted them before, found them at the SGK fundraiser and gave them a call. They were the easiest to work with too!  I'll tell you when i had the carrot cake i went straight to heaven! The cupcake was devine. The creamcheese  was perfect, not to sweet or to bland. The Black and White had a moist cake, but i took off the frosting (not sure what it was made of). I am still trying to get into the shop on a banana cupcake day. My only complaint is that i visited the shop the day after my birthday, because were staying across the street at the W Hotel, and we arrived on the wrong day! No banana cupcakes available. They only have certain flavors available certain days boo hoo! If only there were one in Phx. One thing to note, when visiting you will not see many beverages pushed in your face, instead they are on the down low. Yes you can order coffee, tea or milk too you just have to ask. Bri said they need to expand the coffee menu and make the drinks more available, but i was good with milk.

So sad I have to give this local establishment 1 star; but after 3 attempts to enjoy a meal there, I JUST CAN'T DO IT CAPTAIN! We arrived for a late lunch at 3:30pm and were pleasantly surprised at Happy Hour in the middle of the day!   First off...it smells like you just walked into the men's room in mexico, when you first enter from the Central Avenue entrance; then it lingers making its way to the bar, thinning out with each step, until you get to a point where you just get used to it arriving at the bar. My sister wanted to leave immediately but it was the only place big enough downtown Phoenix to bring my bike inside, so we toughed it out-again. I torture myself only because I really want to give the downtown establishments a chance!  However the food killed it for me this time. We ordered appetizers for 3. The homemade salsa with chips and a side of sour cream shouldn't be that hard to do. They won me half way with this because turns out the chips are homemade-and delicious! but the salsa is pace picante. If i'd a known that I would have ordered something else. The potato skins came out looking as if they were made previously, then left sitting around for 5 hours, then re-cooked bacon and all! They were dry and crumbly as heck and the ranch dressing was straight out of the bottle (the horribly tasting one). The Salad was ok, but the ranch made it worse.  My  friend who was visiting from Texas enjoyed her French Toast, so therein lies the 1 star=breakfast at lunch time yay. It looked okay. Nothing to rave about though.  Since it had been almost 2 years since we all seen each other=a shot was in order! 3 raspberry kamikazi's please.....What? You don't know how to make a Rasp Kami? What a waste of a full bar. Luckily I knew the ingredients and the measurements; but funny thing is the bartender, who said she didn't know how to make the drink, kept insisting there was soda water. Even after explaining the recipe she added soda water=WTF?  I have seen crowds waiting to see the Murder Mystery Theater productions held there, but i'm not sure if I could stand the smell that long! I have to regrettably say this will be my last attempt @_@

I'm loving this place!!! this is why people move here. a little rain, and not much more. the sun shines when the snow falls elsewhere. i can ride my bike in January...un-heard of on the east. i like that i get to wear a sweater, wigs and sometimes gloves-because i'm an accessories W----re. i now have the train at my beck and call...its making the city an even more beautiful place to be. i should stop complimenting this place or our population will triple again. YIKES. thankfully the sprawl has losts its glow and we are moving on up!!! the downtown sky rises and new housing is doing wonders for the city. i remember when the sunset=desolate baren city of phoenix, not anymore!!! gotta love this place, tried to leave so many times, but always end up right back here. maybe i'll stay....maybe.

based on the reviews  posted to the side, i wonder how this happens to be a place i truly enjoy and always end up at. I'm usually very particular, but maybe the big tips are bringing my experiences to a higher level of service than the norm. TRANSLATION= just because its an english bar, doesn't mean they have the VAT (value added tax=to you and me, this means tip) added in. tip the service and they will remember your name, or what you ordered, don't be bitchy (this is still just lil 'ole arizona people) and ask for it all at once. and please remember (not an excuse-just a fact) English are not known for their delicious food, they in fact have the most unlusted after cuisine. with that in mind....my review:  i love this place! everything is great (except for the beer battered items-unless you like taking a chug of beer right before you pop a piece of zucchini in your mouth) as a non-beer fan, i would hope that they had an alternative to the beer batter. i've had it other places and the strong beer taste is not there, so if your a beer lover, you will love the batter for it takes like straigh beer! the chips are tasty....they give you ranch too, and its delicious!  the best part about this place is the POOL TABLE!!!!! i'm an avid fan, player and choose this place many a time just for the table.   the place is a converted old historical house (used to be the SRP sponsored doll house back in 2001) they closed up the hallway and made it the bar area. each room is a different type of setting, such as the bar area with bar stools and a nice old bar, the game room with bar, the pool table room with stools and chairs and then the lounge area (or pub area) with tables, reminiscent of an english tavern (my favorite was right in the W1 area, on chambers i think).   for all you smokers, you will love the outside patio (takes up the entire front lawn) they have tons of tables, couches, chairs and bar stools out there, best of all you will be right in the center of downtown Phoenix, close to the new monorail....hello safe ride home!

okay, so it took me a while to get to this place. it's normally always closed when im in the area, but finally my seester & i made it! the place is located in an old Taco Bell bulding (the retro type) so you can totally enjoy the outside patio without much outside interference. we arrived just before the last hour was up, so we got seated right away. unfortunately the momentum of the servers was already exhausted, because it took about 45 minutes for our breakfast, and it took about half that time to place our order. there wasn't ever anyone around, except for the bussers (who didn't speak a lick'o english-or so they pretended) we even overheard two other tables complaining about not being approached for drinks or the initial order for 20 minutes, and we couldn't help but laugh at how long they would be there after placing their order!  the food was deo, but my sister had to go hunt down syrup for her stack. i noticed the bar a little too late, next time we will sit there. it looked as though those servers inside knew what they were doing.   i asked for coffee with a lot of cream, got the coffee with room for only 1 creamer, no cream and i had to get into a spanish convo with the busser because she didn't understand CREAM, totally forgot to ad the "A" and say "CREAMA" my bad.   i must say that the prices are good, the food looked and tasted good (after it finally arrived) just don't expect to have a server, you'll have to bring in your own condiments and fetch your own coffee. dang they must have had a "phat breakfast" (received lotso' tips) that day....because by the time we arrived, they had all quit for the day. it was a totall out of body experience for them, I'm sure, because i seen people wearing the uniforms. if you go visit this place make sure you arrive just as the crowd is winding down, not much later, or you'll have to don your apron.  UPDATE- just found out Aaron May owns this restaurant; funny thing is at his other place they are outstanding when it comes to customer service.

Yummy! i love sushi and i love this place. we went last night about 7:30pm and were quickly seated in front by the window. our server promptly arrived for our drink order. We ordered a bottle of the plum wine for $20 and it was delicious. we also ordered the seafood salad, which was a generous heaping of crab, tons of baby scallops and shrimp over a bed of mixed greens with a ginger dressing, cucumber and carrots. we also ordered yellow tail & maguro sushi, plus the eel, crab and avacodo roll & the fried california roll served on eel sauce. it was all very fresh and tasty. the last roll melted in my mouth, their california rolls have a crab mix inside, my only complaint, except when its deep fried.  the free serving of edamame was a nice start too!   the first time we tried kabuki was on my sisters birthday last July. she had a group of 15 and they were very accomodating, even dressed and presented our own cake brought in for her. for a big group, they did a phenominal job, even with all the split checks "Oye vei" just the thought. oh yeah speaking of head effecting, we all had a popper that makes a bang when you pull the string and at the blow of the candles we pulled the strings. even with all the loud pops and the stares, the servers, managers and bussers were so nice, not saying a word or frowning on it.  (but don't try this unless your ready for the repercussions) ENJOY yelpers and make sure if you don't want a big 'o roll to eat, order the cut rolls, hand rolls are always big (someone should teach a sushi 101 class to teach these things, it might curtail all the bad reviews)  the best part about eating there is the nice walk around the tempe market place. its a strip mall-turned outdoor entertainment haven for tourist, but its people watching at its best. only problem is its in an akward area, with one way in and one way out. the traffic in & out sucks and sometimes the parking is worse, but get over it , enjoy the company your with and get your Kabuki on!

wow! we finally found this place after 3 mos of salivating and anticipating. well let me tell you, it was well worth the wait. we accidentally stumbled in after riding around on bikes looking for a place with a byob policy. sure am glad the sushi place next door had a not so friendly or inviting bartender, otherwise we would have stayed and missed bread fruit! we were the first to arrive, so we had first choice... which was of course outside! only problem with the outside dining is the chairs with rounded legs on the grass, which was very shaky. other than that, everything else was great. we were riding around on bikes, and this was the first stop, so we went with a plethora of sides... and we were pleasantly surprised at the flavors and intricacies of each simple dish. they looked so simple, but tasted very true to the islands. I've been to jamaica and have to say that i felt sa though i had been secretly flown back there without my knowledge... only thing missin was the ocean. the simplest dishes were the best and most tasty. i mean it doesn't get any simpler than steamed cabage and peppers, but hello tasty coconut after taste. the dumplings were tasty too! i loved the sauce, had to try both, and i devoured them! the coleslaw was my second fav. very simple but filled with tons of flavor! sa the night progressed about 4 table tops showed up, so if i have to guess 7pm is a great time to go and be served fast. yes you can take ur own wine, not sure about beer. since we were biking and didn't want to ride full, i didn't do desert. however next time im trying the pudding! enjoy this hidden treasure, i sure did.

Never Never Never again! This place is anything but worth your money. We went this past Saturday for their 2nd year anniversary party and it was horrible. When we arrived at 11pm and meet up with a couple friend of ours it looked as though it might be a great night. we even had a chance to dance! we had been here a few times before and even though we had to leave then because a security had maced someone and it got in the system making the entire room choke; for some odd reason i thought that was a rare occurrence.  and even this night, when meeting a girl and her group standing near the bar; as she told me she had my back if anyone tries to start anything with us, i didn't think twice about people fighting in a club; i mean that's what happened when you were in high school right? i explained to her how  positivity is on my side and her response was "yeah but sometimes that positivity brings negativity in here." i was still baffled but thought ok, must be a rough day for her. but low and behold SHE was right!!!! some rooster looking girl tried to start a fight with one of my chicas because she was smiling in her direction! and the worst part about it, she had just tried to sucker punch me before that because i wouldn't let her big ass friend dirty dance on me. they were dirty dancing and letting all their rolls hang out; but because we are skinny, they thought we were an easy target. security seen it all, witnessed them come at us 4 three times and didn't do anything but move crazy eyes to another part of the club. well low and behold you can't keep a caged animal unleashed, so she came back with all her vigor towards her again. i couldn't believe that security would allow such a brazen & ugly girl back in the area only to start another fight. now i totally understand what that first girl was referring too! now i understand why there are always fights in this place, why the mace was sprayed last time, why when i mention PHX to some people they roll their eyes and vow not to ever attend anything there again.  the crowd wasn't even good looking. it was like they scrapped the bottom of the barrel. the door charge was $15 and the drinks were $10 each. they had no A/C on, but many fans and burning candles (yeah they must not comprehend the fact that candles are heat conductors).  at our arrival the door security guy tried to frisk me 3 times. i asked for a lady to do it and he hassled me, but never the less i didn't let him frisk me; and the only reason we stayed was because we had 5 other girls and 5 guys meeting us there. now i know why there where 4 cop cars outside their doors. this place is the worst place to go for hip hop the only good thing about the entire night was listening to DJ robby rob.   so if your looking for a fight, want to see big, and i mean BIG girls bumping and grinding on the dance floor in their too tiny tops and skirts letting all them rolls poke out then this is the place for you, if your looking to get maced just hanging out dancing and chocking to death then go to PHX in downtown phoenix, but if your looking for a great time to dance, chill with your friends and meet some classy and fun people DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT go to the PHX in downtown phoenix.

hmmm, i happened to meet the owner of this restaurant at the crown imports,  before they opened, and promised to try it out. have to say that i'm happy they made it past the 6 month period. I finally made it in today with my mother, aunt and sister. we arrived at 11:30am so we just beat the lunch crowd to our seats. since it was a fa-la-la type 'o day we started with tasty treats....midori for the ladies and a signature drink for me, the blood orange vodka was too strong a taste for me, but the water washed it down great! that was a "one-drink-test' for me, next time no blood orange vodka.   our server was very nice, but flaky. he served us drinks, which he spilled on the table, then left without a simple toss of the napkin. my aunt asked for one, he brought the bacteria riden towel from the bus tub and wiped the table, half a-s. his second time around i asked for bar napkins to sop up the wetness, which he so graciously obliged too.  we ordered the fettuccini alfredo ($12 i think) roasted mozzarella sticks ($10) mozarella capresse (forgot how much) and the lettuce wraps ($10). my aunt and mother raved about the fettuccini alfredo, while the lettuce wraps garnered lots of complaints. I tasted it and the chicken tasted like it was on its third day. the water chestnuts were served whole and the lettuce was romaine lettuce, wonder how they expected that to be served and then wrapped. it was horrible, served in a tiny little dish that you have to scoop out of. i definitely would not order that ever again. the roasted mozarella sticks were so unusually delicious though. i've never (in all my travels abroad and the like) ever ever ever experienced something like that dish. it was roasted lettuce under a balsamic and olive oil drizzle, with skewers of tomatoes, bell pepper and fresh mozarella (I think). the entire dish is then put under the roaster and served fresh from the oven. it was my favorite. the mozarella capresse panini sandwich looked delicious, and my sister said it was awesome! the fries were very tasty, and pushed on her by the server (good going server boiee!)   leaving the place was relatively simple, the server actually had a sense of timing and turn-around. he did the check back and check drop all at the same time. finally a place that understands people who lunch are always on the go....no need to wait on the tables, they have an outdoor patio too! stay away from all the chicken mixture dishes here, and you'll be tasting some deolicious dishes, but venture to the premixed salads and you risk tasting 3 day old meats. order wisely and eat with aboundant pleasure.

Okay for convenience this place marks the spot, if your in need of a quick pick item for a meal your making that day. Don't by produce (even if it looks perfect) to store for more than one day, or that beautiful apple will turn brown and spotty before your eyes. Kinda weird, but it happens, not sure why and not even the workers there can believe it sometimes. That day i returned them, they looked at the date on the package thinking it must have been on sale or something, only to read that i just bought them the day before and they were not on sale. Her eyes told me the entire story...she, just as i, was wondering how a perfectly red apple could have turned so bad overnight. It may have something to do with the types of specials they get, to keep their prices so low. Guess those articles about them in Europe selling bad food for cheap is somewhat true. However, you can still find some tasty items, name brands and good deals, just use it all fast! One nice thing about this place is the no waiting in lines.....gotta love that!

What a phenominal resting place, and an even better party place. Oh my luxuriously comfortable bed! I could have slept all day. Only wish the light wasn't peeping through the bathroom window at the crack of day (especially after partying all night, then going for a late night swim after the club was closed 24hr pool for guests is awesome!). The shower was great, but the sink was HORRIBLE. I shouldn't have put on my clothes until after i brushed my teeth, because the square shallow sink splashed all the water back up everytime i rinsed.   They have a nack for making it up to you when their service lacks. We paid for our room a month before, asked for adjoining rooms but when we arrived, they didn't have one reserved for us. Since it was my birthday, sister mentioned it and asked why they would promise one, if they only have three of the type. I happed to walk up at the time, said it was okay and i was chill with it. They upgraded us to a bigger room, delivered half a dozen chocolate covered strawberries and gave me all the wrist bands i needed (7- normally $25 each) , for the 944 magazine party held roof top at the pool. It was probably the fact that i didn't over react or act like a jerk, i killed them with kindness, as always, and they delivered! I will definitely stay there many more times.   The club is very scottsdale and trendy with house music. I like the fact that the pool is open 24 hrs. We sat on the stadium seats and people watched. Luckily 944 had lots of stuff going on too.   I think this place is great for the price and the rooms are so much fun! If your a vouyer this is the place for you. If your a partier this place is for you (your VIP at the club and the security doesn't act like douchebags when they see your band) only complaint is when the security doesn't see your wrist band, they are A - - - - - - S the biggest kind. They act like they work in Beverly Hills or Hollywood and the world is trying to steal their star. So if your looking for a place to party and sleep, stay here, but remember if you leave the hotel, upon your return, hold your hand up high at the door and your all good. lol

yup this place looks fab from the inside with splendid views of the street happenings. but i had to give this a 2 star rating because the service was below par. there weren't that many people in the place to justify the 30 minute wait for our first round of drinks or the 20 minute wait for our check after the initial request, or the accidentally un-heard cancellation of a burger for the sliders (both plates were brought out) or the charge for an extra drink on our tab.   it was definitely bizarro world because the food was delicious! except for the mustard on the sliders, everything was delicious. the fries are like little fried sticks of spicy heaven. the spice is very sparse, but intense. not hot, just an intense flavor injection that wakes up your taste buds and makes them yelp for more! they are served up in the cutest of tins and the food presentation is outstanding. i love to eat with my eyes first, and  this place has got it going on babydoll and the fries are on fire (not fire hot, but tasty!)  the calamari was perfectly dusted in a light coating, not your usual 6 dunkers (as in thick coating that covers the lack of seafood) we ordered a sampling of most of the appetizers, but no entrees. next time i'll try a full meal, i just won't go when there are more than 2 tables being served at a time by the same server, i sure am not going to wait, and wait, and wait to leave again. one of our party actually had to hunt down the stamp for validation at the hostess stand, rumaging around until finally someone came over, only after 10 minutes, to help. guess they are still trying to keep this place a ghost town after all.   the decor on the other hand is absolutely grand for our little ole town, but not grand enough to help you overlook the lack of cultural flavor or service or the stuffy ambiance. the place felt like a tourist trap in the center of "i just graduated from yale, wanna party and get loose, wearing some faded jeans, a cowboy shirt and a clean cut lookin like i just left the frat party last night and feeling a little too stuffy to be real, sitting with this chip on my shoulder and a bad taste in my mouth" come on Phoenix, is this what its all coming down too? okay i'm in for the food, take your own party and live it up. hell, just sneak in some little bottles from the mini bar and you won't care about the wait for anything.

wow! if i knew it was gonna be like that-it would have happened a long time ago!!!! went for 2 services from D'Lisa and was quite shocked and amazed that a Service Salon would actually be running on time! A busy woman like me needs to stick to a schedule and most salons are too busy to realize their clients are busy too, so they make you wait, and wait-but not here. She welcomed me, offered me something to satiate my thirst and off we went.   D'Lisa is extremely professional and very fun. The chit chat and laughter made an unpleasant service very joyful (without sharing too much lol). I was relaxed and very comfortable. Her space is very calm and inviting, so much so that I already scheduled my next visit! I'm amazed with the after sensation the most. Her swift hands made the B go smooth real fast. I would recommend her for first timers ^_~   The second service i had was one of the most relaxing and invigorating facials i have ever had. I know those 2 words are complete opposites, but its true. Her music is set to the facial so you feel an intensely deep connection to her touch. She uses Sesame oil so her massage is safe for all skin types and she is so fabulous that she includes a foot, forearm, hand and scalp massage with the facial and all for little $$$$$$. I believe she is still running the special of $59 for that facial so make your appointment ASAP!   I have seen make-up done by Bailey from the salon and it also looks fabulous! Go meet the lady's at Salon D'Shayn and take back control of your time and money. The services are so affordable and the work is great. This place wants to make you look and feel good affordably-not leave you strapped for cash in pretty coiffed hair with no where to go.

A place that still honors fashion; even after its destruction and reconstruction of the building that once housed a top of the line Department store. If only i could give it a higher rating, based solely on that, but alas this review is about the food. We arrived about 10pm on a friday, so i was thrilled that the full menu was still available; as the entire downtown PHX had almost closed down completely. We sat at the sleek bar, only to be served by a gentleman wearing a filthy butchers apron, it was so unappealing, but i thought if others stayed regardless, then the food must be off the hook!  The music definitely moved me, and i think its what was keeping the people there, lucky for the kitchen.  Wrong, It was anything but. The pizza margarita tasted as though it were made with cheddar, exactly like a mexican cheese crisp. Not good at all! Turns out they make it with a mixture of 3 italian cheeses mozzarella, provolone and asiago. In my opinion provolone should always be served with a meat or mushrooms, because its bold flavor is too over powering to be served with light flavors.   The pork sandwich was soo dry, it was served on hard bread too. I had one bite and left it for brian. I won't be trying that one again.   The best part of my meal was only $4+ and it was the side salad=super big. They added hearts of palms too! I couldn't believe the serving size. Too bad their balsamic dressing is straight balsamic, It would have been okay had they brought out olive oil too. They served me a gobblet of straight balsamic dressing for the salad.   I think they are trying very hard to be cool, but they exert little effort. They do half the job great, then they slack off, so its kinda like being in Willy Wonka's half room. You fall in love with one part, then quickly realize it lacks big time.  The decor is nice, but not enough to make up for the weird uniforms of dirty white butcher shirts or the proscuitto sitting out in the open air; with flys dancing around, sitting on your meat and having a feast until they slice off your piece. Not my cup 'o tea thank you very much.   Maybe my next try will be better, because I will give it another 2 times, as it takes 3 times to know what they trully have to offer.

wow! haircuts that are done right everytime. no attitude, its pure style, fashion and budget merge on fast forward. you'll feel like you went to LA just to get your hair done. Call to make a reservation. Cuts starting at $12, unbelieveable. They sponsored the Locks of Love fundraiser and i've not had my hair cut by anyone else since then. Amazingly they have cut it right everytime! Most people don't cut curly hair, and having been hearding my hair for 13 years, I was determined to find the best stylist. Turns out there are several....all at Paul Mitchell The School.

do they think we poped up in LA or NY? the entire security staff at this hotel has the worst attitude. this is not the best place to go, unless your there on a goshtly dead night, they can't handle the pressure of more than 1 party at a time. can you say MEATHEAD stay away from the JUICE? if you can, your in.....my suggestion is the sushi aroku, as they are owned by different owners and customer service still means something to them. its in the lobby, but don't expect to take your night cap out to the bar if you bought it at the sushi restaruant, different liquor license means "YOU NO GO OUTSIDE" restaruant with your drinks, stay put baby...and drink up.

okay the two stars are based on 3 series of visits to this new addition to the chemus mc caffreys family. the owners of the downtown irish pub have created this grown up, mature but very stylish irish pub just up the way from the other place, and one things for sure! they have the same standards when it comes to service.......non existent, scarce and brain dead. i've tried the pub area (tall comfortable chairs by bar), the lounge area (short chairs away from bar) and last we ate at the bar. the first two times i was in a rush and stated this before hand, we were trying to catch a play during fringe festival, and of course it took her 5 minutes to bring the bill after it was requested, but of course she was standing at the computer flirting with the other server. that day my burger was alright, but the lettuce and tomato served with it looked like left overs from the night before. the corn beef and cabbage was cut like proscuitto, not good very dry, served without butter, and very fatty. however, i gave them another chance a few days later when we return to see another few plays, and this time the service (from same girl-one i over tipped to avoid this lack 'o service-much to my dissmay the big tip meant squat) was horrible. we were one of 3 tables in the place too, however the chef salad and ranch dressing were delicious! the veggies, all but the tomato were fresh! so being that i fell in love with the ranch (so hard to find a good one!) we returned tuesday for lunch, and low and behold the same salad i ordered the other day around supper time was the same price, but half the size!!! what the FFFF????? bad service and cheating the lunch folf without a small discount for smaller portions? not right. the bar service was the same but luckily we weren't in a hurry. however i asked for the bill, it was brought and then the bartender went to take up shop at the server station to talk with the other servers. i litteraly heelyed (i was wearing my heelys -shoes with wheels) over there and took her my check and credit card. im amazed, but i will give them another try, the ranch is deo. don't go to the turf if your picky on service, heck or even if you just want it, they wont give it to you and you'll hate this place. but if your easy going and want to waste time in the AC go there, you will get lots of free air! oh yeah btw the waffle fries are deo too!

okay, finally a nail salon that has pipeless chairs for spa pedicures, friendly people and tons of chairs! 10 spa chairs and 10 manicure tables with lots of professional nail techs. we landed in these chairs after our fabulous lunch in central phoenix, and walked out with the prettiest feet in town. i went with midnight blue-turned purple on my toes, one went with purple, the other light purple and the last a burgundy. my aunt got her eyebrows waxed too, and that was the only complaint, she had her entire lower eye filled with hairs after the waxing was complete, but being a nice one, she decided to pluck the rest herself. if you ever go to this place for the wax, double check the mirror before leaving the seat! to bad my aunt wears glasses, it wasn't until we were in the sun that she noticed.   the mani and pedi was awesome, my massage was phenominal and the massage chair was exctasy. go be pampered and leave feeling like a queen. tell kevin i sent ya!

yummy yummy yummy! right in my neighborhood. so happy with the entire meal, service, ambiance and price! i had the panini and salad, sister had the same and our bill was $20 at most. the panini was called the market, i asked for cibatta, fresh mozarella, basil and tomatoes very fresh! followed by the mediteranean salad topped with a tsatziki dressing, which was plesantly surprising, as i normally hate that stuff! its always so acidic, but alas....not here!!! plus the vegtables are all so bright, fresh and crisp. my flavored ice tea was tasty too! the servings were so perfect for the price! i even had half of a panini to bring home to eat....right about now lol! the place is D-E-O-L-I-C-I-O-U-S, and so close to home yay! next time i'm trying the Mozarella & Tomatoes because its served with walnut bread and i love walnuts.  the service was pleasantly wonderful! we never had to ask for more water or tea, our food was brought out in a very timely manner and the overall atmosphere of the place was quit relaxing. the bathroom door is so sweet! i love to roll things and this big mambo jumbo door rolls!

okay i have re-visited this place last saturday and was extremely unhappy with the fact that after eating a perfectly made crunch roll (made with real crabmeat) my california roll was rancid. I have to wonder if the server just forgot about it, and left it sitting on the bar for pickup, as it arrived about 20 minutes after our first one. my unhappiness and my the redistribution of stars is much more for the fact that, after asking our server to take it away and replace it with another crunch roll, he returned holding the roll and said "that flavor is because this roll is made with imitaion crabmeat and real crabmeat, so there is a slightly different taste" i explained that it wasn't the flavor, but the taste of rancid old fish. i have to say that in my 15+ years of eating sushi, i have never been re-served rancid rolls. don't they know that because this is the desert, fish has to be flown in to be fresh, and at 11pm at night, when a customer tells you the fish is bad...it  more than likely is. so for all of you servers out there,  when a customer tells you the fish is rancid,  just replace it! i'll give them another chance, but it won't be for california rolls (how funny i normally don't even order them, but wanted to taste the difference from that and my favorite Crunch roll) serves me right for experimenting! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1st review of Moira was this one.... finally! a place where us late night eaters can go for some delicious and very well prepared sushi in downtown phoenix. i got an email with a note about the newly added happy hour menu (both regular and reverse) and was excited to go try a sampling of the artistic sushi i savored over while reading reviews and sampling experiences, in the local zines. i was surprised that we could arrive at 10:45pm on saturday and the kitchen would still be open with people eating and enjoying a late night rendevous. we sat at the sushi bar, on the most uncomfortable chairs you could ever imagine. the chairs look cool and fashionable, but i still have bruises on my legs from getting in and out of my metal box of a chair. i will never sit at the sushi bar again, so long as they have them chairs (dang one should never say never!)   the food was very fresh, colorful and artistic. the presentation and combinations are phenominal. the miso soup was so authentic and filled to the brim with tofu and cost less than $4 for a cup of tofu filled, yummy, light and fresh miso soup, dang you just can't go wrong! (lucky you tofu lovers-i'm not a fan myself so this was actually a negative for me)  I had the cucumber salad and must say, i was thrown for a loop with this one.  i'm a cucumber salad (sunomono salad) loving fool if i gots to say so myself. Funny thing, i'm not a fan of raw onions so my first reaction to the cucumber salad was "YUKKIE" (just in my head) until i tasted it. the onions were so thin, that they tasted delicious in the salad. it added another bite to it, which was needed, because the dressing wasn't authentic in half vinegar to half sugar. they may be thinking of the diet craze, because there was much less sugar in it than there should have been, it was slightly vinegary.   i was pleased with every roll i had! only brought home 2 pieces out of 3 rolls just for me. my sister played it safe and just ordered one roll, squid salad and miso soup. I have to say her squid salad was deo, but only a few bites for me please.   this is definitely a place for all occasions and all sizes of parties, from 1-10 people so utilize happy hour responsibly. get your group on at moira and your friends will love ya for introducing them to the most tasty dishes in town!

Meh, i've experienced better....to bad the food had to suffer the wrath of the horrible service dolled out by cr__g. it actually looked delicious, would have been fabulous had the sucky server been courteous enough to do a check back, at anytime during the meal! we ordered a build your own pizza, each of us with 3 items added, both pizzas had jalepenos and both were loaded with them. in a pizza joint (no matter the beautiful decor-this is still a pizza joint); you would imagine that any pizza served with jalepenos would come with a refill of your drink (especially if there isn't anything left in the glass before the pizza drop off) it took about 15 minutes to get someone (our server was outside picking his nose or something) to bring me a refill of iced tea. i understand that the refill might be free so its not a priority, but the damn pizza for one was $9.00, my salad was $12 (a horribly unseasoned ceasar salad that tasted like it was dressed in plain mayonaise) and my sisters pizza was $14 for one, so we didn't expect such a horrible experience such as ours; on a day when the room didn't have a waiting list. i will give it 2 more trys, as that is usually what it takes to get an accurate account of the food and service, but you better believe i will not sit in Cr---gs area again. he not only sucked majorly, but he lacked the traits of a mediocre server, poor guy, poor parlor. if his section is the only one open next time, i'm goin to california pizza kitchen or mama mia's, maybe even le grand orange.

could have been a 2 star rating because of the cleanliness, but realized that another chain burger joint charging $10 for an average burger didn't deserve it, especially when the burger is served with a side of sarcasm. not to mention that they are not community friendly at all. I asked to drop some flyers for the Grand Avenue Festival and they said no, not that they needed to say yes, but when I asked the manager to talk with the franchise managers about being a little more community involved and supportive; the manager barked very rudely "none of the businesses around here do that"; which was a lie because just next door on college- Port Of Subs and the Cupz Coffee both allow people to leave flyers for their customers, so did the Hawaiian place and almost every other business around. I had to give this a 1 star because Arizona doesn't need another over priced, community sucker, who is not interested in creating a community, but just bleeding the money and running. he was so unfriendly and sarcastic that I didn't even want to place my order after that. i'll stick with Maizie's burgers anyday! I also heard the Grind on Camelback Rd  next to the Fenix eatery at about 40th street was the shiznitz! They said its hands down the best in town....on my way soon.

I was trying to wait till I tried this place again, but decided eh, why not just write it now. The restaurant is located inside the Wild Horse Pass. The food is delicious too bad the service SUCKS big time! We had a plethora of appetizers and not one of them let me down. Our party was big so the service sucked at the worst time. They took our orders in order, then when serving the entire meal; each dish was yelled out by the servers deli style and then handed to our guests to place on the table themselves (if we wanted to serve ourselves we would have done a buffet). They did it very rude too. My plate was supposed to be served sizzling, but somehow the waiter forgot to serve it, as it sat on the table next to us for 5 minutes, then served lukewarm. On our way out (to dance) I witnessed the bartender reach into the ice bin with the actual glass she was serving the drink in (isn't this a violation?). I wonder if the service sucks because the menu is so affordable and delicious they are counting on return business? non the less I won't be back.

price matching on business cards, in-house color copies for $0.19 each side and friendly service has me sold! i've been a customer of Randy's since he first started business here in the valley over 10 years ago, and recently found him again! his quality is superb. fast service too. they can do it all; print, graphic design and copy. full color is even available in the new water proof cards. check them out for your next design service, you'll be happy your money is staying in town, because they are locally owned and always available.

CORRECTION: They have 1/2 price happy hours from 4-8pm Thursday through Saturday.  When you walk up to this place it really does look like the White House, columns and all! The interior is nice and minimal with a big ARSE disco ball hanging over a big 'ole go-go box. There are two long bars and some comfy seating. The owner is very hospitable, making you feel as though you are in her home! She did all the interior decorating too. We went for a meet-up outing and stayed for the service. It was complimentary Champagne for the ladies until 8pm and 2-4-1 you call its. Seester ordered some finger food, fried zucchini & mushrooms $3 and a bowl of american fries $3 and both were very tasty. Tiffany ordered a a grilled chicken salad and the presentation was impeccable. Everything looked so fresh! She was delighted and amazed that the cost was only $7 in Scottsdale! The flatbread was rolling out non-stop but we didn't order any, next time we will though!   They have 1/2 price happy hours from 8-10pm Thursday through Saturday. The music was awesome too. They even had flat screens tuned into baseball so you know I was diggin it! This place has only been open 6 months and it has a great vibe. They have an outdoor area that they convert into a lounge complete with couches for the smokers.   I love the big open room and the long bars. The service is great and the bartenders down to earth! So next time your group is looking for a place to meet, head over to the WhiteHouse, I promise you won't be disappointed.

I heard about this place many a times and today Tanya took me to try it out. I was happy with the thought of being Green or VERDE for lunch, little did i know how green it would be. After reading some of the reviews I had to see it for myself, and i'm glad i did. Seems there is a bigger picture behind the place. The picture is a Greener world! They utilized paper plates, plastic spoons and the like because it is better on our environment. At the moment they are waiting on a back order of forks and spoons made out of corn, much easier on the environment the owners says, and so did my green expert friend Tanya.   A quick scan of the menu and i was a little disappointed at the lack of single tacos but quickly settled on the Verde Salad with chicken. Tanya had the pulled pork served with beans and rice. Of course i also had the chips and salsa (which was a green tomatillo and a red salsa served in two tiny dishes) the chips were quite tasty and so were the salsas. However the salsas were quite mild so the need for sour cream was nil. The salad was romain lettuce, radishes (which i tossed out as i ate), tomato, shredded chicked (only problem here was the fat left on the meat-i cannot stand the feel of skin or fat of the chicken in my mouth so i had to pull at the chicken), fried bacon and a tasty dressing-all of it very fresh. Tanya loved her meal and didn't leave a bit left over on her plate, just as I!   The place was decorated with all repurposed items. The table and box chairs were such a wonderful idea. The first sturdy setting i've seen in a restaurant around Phoenix in a long time. They also participate in the Art Walk with local art hanging for sale on the walls.   This place is crisp and clean. Very affordable = all entrees are $6-8 and come with rice and beans. The chips and salsa was $2.50 and the Guacamole (i will try this next time!) was only $3.00. As i  mentioned there aren't any tacos served a la carte, but you can get a side of rice or beans! I'll definitely be back for the Guac!

I only had a chance to visit this place at the Grand Opening of the City Scape center downtown Phoenix last Thursday, but they served up some tasty treats!!! I never in my life have ever tried Cotton Candy ice cream (and growing up i lived next door to a family that made and sold Cotton Candy daily) Not only was it nostalgic, but it tasted exactly like Cotton Candy!!! They also gave me 2 samples of the Vanilla Ice Cream and it has vanilla specs in it. (even though Vanilla Ice Cream in the states was ruined thanks to my having tried it curb side in Guadalupe, Antigua- fresh from the Vanilla bean and Ice from the cooler) there's was very tasty! I would recommend this shop for all those on the west side (kinda weird that they would partake in a Grand Opening of the City Space in Downtown=but I reaped the rewards!!!!) Hopefully they will be opening up in the City Scape. I would be in heaven if they did ^_~

These 2 stars come after partaking in the Grand Opening Festivities on both Thursday and Saturday. I couldn't believe that they scheduled the Grand Opening on a 1st Friday weekend first off; as that makes it look as though the organizers of the event lacked confidence in the attendance for this event. They rushed the grand opening (even though Thursdays samplings of local restaurant served up some tasty treats!) despite the fact that half of the complex and most of the venues are slate to open at a later date.   I did like the stage in the street set up, it made me feel like i was in NYC at a street fair. A weird concept was having 7 bars and 1 food vendor on Saturday (WTF? I like to drink with the rest of them, but come on!) we tried to patronize the new burger spot, but the line was insane (and waiting 1 hour for a $15/person burger meal was not an option)   I must say the best part about the City Scape project by Red Development is the use of the upstairs plaza. They created a lounge feel; outside. It has an urban feel to it (finally something in Phoenix feels urban!) The funniest part of the City Scape is the signage they have near the fountain pad; which states that you must shower before you enter the fountains and lists boils & open wounds while referring to those that should not enter the fountains, oh yeah if your incontinent you have a special rule written just for you!   I'll be looking forward to free music every Friday though, I just hope they do something about the food situation, cuz a girls gotta eat!  On Thursday I tasted Food Samples by:  1130 (AZ Center) - Chicken Alfredo=tasty, chicken cooked to perfection  Vitamin T (City Scape/coming soon) - Steak taco with guacamole and a delicious salsa  Phoenix Convention Center (Duh)- Delicious steak cubes (med rare thank you=thanks for the 3 cubes chef!) one with their salsa and 2 plain  plus a delicious mini shrimp cocktail served in the most darling carved out little bamboo cups  Cooperstown (Behind US Airways Arena on Jackson) - Spicy chicken Alfredo which was very tasty and cooked to perfection  Hooters (AZ Center) - Mediocre hot wings served in a sweet spicy sauce  Sam's Cafe (AZ Center) - Big & delicious crab cake served with crispy carrots and a delicious sauce plus the chef gave me several White Chocolate tamales YUMMY!  I also had a delicious pumpkin pie ice cream, vanilla ice cream which had specs of vanilla, and a cotton candy ice cream which tasted rather deo!   Sadly though only 1 of the restaurants from the City Scape (which wasn't even open) participated in the event. Which in my opinion was a rather big faux pas; because one little taste of delicious food isn't enough. As a business owner you should know that  when people taste your food and like it; they are more likely to patronize your business right then and there!   I'm looking forward to what is still to come of the City Scape, but I only hope that the marketing team takes a bigger look at what the city is really trying to accomplish with this space=added patrons of downtown Phoenix, not stealing the patrons of the 20+ year event the entire nation knows as 1st Friday. There are plenty other days and weekends to choose from for parties and celebrations of the Urban city Phoenix is trying to grow into.

WOW! this was one of the best haunted houses i've experienced in a LONG time!!! Know I understand why its ranked in the top 10 of haunted houses in the US. The only reason its 4 stars is the price. $25 each is a little too much. But I will give them the benefit of the doubt since you do get to walk through what looks like the real wild west (Rawhide). It looked like tombstone. There are bars too, so one for the nerves is no problem.   While your walking to the Nest characters are walking towards you intermittently, and I was caught off guard, which made me scream like a baby. One of the funniest scenes was watching a chainsaw carrying, scarred up guy chase a girl all the way towards the entrance of the park. There was a 30 minute wait in line that passed rather fast with all the commotion of the chain saw massacre. When we got into the building there was a little person rolling around with a Mohawk in a wheel chair, just rolling through the mazes of rope....kinda weird, gave us a taste of what was to come though.   There were several different types of atmospheres such as metal rooms, blacked out rooms, skwishy tube rooms that make you feel like someone just gave birth to you, chain linked mazes that make great use of the scene and the unhitched chain link. The zombies and the monsters are top notch.   One of my favorite parts was the room with the boxes, before the live buried lady in the _____________ with _______. I have to give props to the props too! The use of black outs were awesome, but a little too much at one point. I would definitely recommend this place to all.

Smells great around this Container Park eatery, but the food is a much different story. Since neither a baked potato or mashed potatoes were included with their combos,  I chose the pork ribs combo platter with coleslaw and a green salad, while my love chose brisket with BBQ pork & beans and a green salad. Not normally a brisket lover, this brisket converted me; which made much more sense after trying to eat one of the pork ribs, because it tasted like beef jerky on a stick. The ribs were so undercooked that the grizzle was perfectly intact and not only looked, but chewed like gum. I realized that the reason their brisket tasted so delicious, was actually because it hadn't been cooked as long as normal, not even quite sure they know of this accidental perfection. I just wished they accidentally left their ribs on the barbie instead. The best part about the place was the option to pour my own BBQ sauce on the side. Trying to overlook the ribs I moved onto the coleslaw. It was seasoned lightly, served in a soupy consistency, but not half bad. I think they may have forgot to salt the cabbage, because the water kept coming, no matter how many times I drained it. I couldn't say much for the green salad, because it was more like a dead, wilted, slimey salad. They tried to hide limp black lettuce, along with rusted romain ends, under fresh green pieces; very shady if you ask me. I should have taken the counter girls bad customer service as a big hint to run to the next place fast, but it smelled so good I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I would buy a few sides of the BBQ baked beans to go from Big Ern's, because they were out of this world, loaded with shredded meat and could have easily been my meal; but never ever would I order the ribs or green salad from this place again. With so many awesome eateries and choices in Las Vegas, I say try another one. The place is small, and on any given day 2 of the 5 inside tables are taken by management.
