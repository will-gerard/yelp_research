I love this place.  Everyone needs to go here and they will love it too. Photographers - they have classes you can take where you have access to the garden at night.  What's more awesome than a picture of the full moon with a mighty saguaro in front of it.  They also have smart phone photography classes.  If you don't need a class, there is so much to photograph here.  I've captured amazing shots of hummingbirds, flowers, butterflies, art, and people just to name a few.  An awesome  place to practice your craft. The events - There is something always going on.  Luminaries, Music in the Garden, Pumpkin Festival, Chocolates and Chiles, Dia de Los Muertos, giant art installations, plant sales, and these are just a few that happen in the fall.  If you had a membership, it could be paid back in unique visits within a couple weeks. Classes - I already talked about the photography classes (those are the ones I've taken) but there are so many others!  You want to learn how to garden?  Maybe create a drip system?  Blow glass?  Practice Tai-Chi?  Seriously you can do all of this in the most picturesque place Phoenix has to offer. I'm a huge fan of the garden and recently joined their Monarch Society that includes membership to the garden and has extra special events for young professionals.  That means enjoying everything awesome the garden has to offer with other awesome people.   They are in the process of building a restaurant there which I am so looking forward to dining at.  What a great location for drinks and fresh local food. If you think it's just walking around looking at cactus, think again.

Greatest dive bar ever! Their Christmas decorations rival that of Coach House but without the Scottsdale crowd.   You can find every type of person hanging out here.   The staff is friendly and they pour heavy (but not too heavy).  My friend said to me a few months ago, "I found the greatest dive bar ever you have to go to called the Swizzle Inn!"  I replied, "It is the greatest!  I've been going to the Swizz for years."  Maybe I should have shared the info sooner?

Luci is awesome.  She took the time to explain to me exactly what she was doing and how it would affect my hair.  She recommended products that would help keep my locks looking amazing, but did not push for me to buy them there.  She is very knowledgeable and friendly and I was easily able to trust she was going to do my hair good. This salon is beautiful.  It's very open and has a warm feeling to it.  The gal at the front desk was so sweet, so be nice to her.  This is a Bumble and Bumble salon; so if anything, just go in to get a conditioning treatment and styling A great salon in my favorite part of town!  Go see Luci!

My friend had a Groupon ready to expire and was awesome enough to share it with me.  I've lived here all my life and always thought of Vincent's as a place our grandparents would all hang out at.  The decor looks like it, but that's ok.  It's a French restaurant and definitely not geared toward yup's.  The food and service were still fantastic. We started with the foie gras and duck tamales.  Duck tamales at a French restaurant seemed a little strange on the menu; so we were intrigued to order.  They tasted like duck tamales.  They were good.  The foie gras was awesome.  We were also brought the most delicious croissants I have ever had. For our main courses, I had the lamb and my friend had the wild boar.  My lamb was fantastic and came with yummy potatoes and green beans.  The wild boar was good.  If you are curious what while boar tastes like; it tastes like pork.  Lamb is one of my favorite meats and this was definitely one of my favorite times eating lamb.   We finished off with desserts.  I ordered the profiteroles and my friend had a grand marnier souffle.  You really only need to order one dessert per four people.  They are large.  The profiteroles were tasty and very rich.  I couldn't come close to finishing them.  The souffle was actually two souffles.  I've never had a souffle before so can not really say if it was a good souffle or not.  It tasted like eggs.  My friend said they are supposed to.  The chef brought us out complimentary flour less chocolate cake.  That was delicious.  It would have been amazing with some vanilla ice cream on top. The food was amazing and I will definitely be back when in the mood for some French cuisine or even just for some wine and desserts.  I would recommend as a great place to take your mom for her birthday too.

While my regular gal was out on maternity leave, I decided to go see Ann Gentle to keep my hair fantastic.  I used to go to this salon many years ago and was happy to be back.  Many of the girls there said hello and that they missed seeing me coming in.  It was nice to feel so welcome. Ann has never done my hair before and thought I might bring in a picture.  My bad, I didn't.  I did as best I could to explain what I wanted to her.  She asked great questions about how natural or dramatic I wanted my coloring to be.  She ended up doing a great job and my hair turned out better than I what I had hoped for.  My highlights were weaved tight and my hair looked very natural as I requested.   I highly recommend Ann Gentle if you want your hair to have great color!

I saw amazing reviews on Yelp, so decided to go here.  I left very confused how these reviews came about. We ordered cocktails, which were tasty.  We also ordered an appetizer, carpaccio.  We promptly received that and bread.  Those were both fine.  We waited what seemed like an eternity for our server to come back to our table to order.  I watched him go to every table around us a couple times while we received our appetizer, ate it, and a busser took the plate before I flagged him down so we could order.   My friend ordered the lasagna, which tasted like a Wendy's cheeseburger.  Seriously, my friend said try it and tell me what fast food it tastes like.  I laughed and then tasted it to find it tasted exactly like a double stack, but 10 times the price.  I ordered the pollo salute that was described as chicken topped with marscapone, prosciutto, and a brandy mushroom sauce.  I didn't find any marscapone or prosciutto on top, but there was a mushroom sauce that reminded me of Campbell's Cream of  Mushroom soup.  I was certain they followed the recipe on the can.  I had a side of penne pasta covered in the bland marinara and vegetables.  The vegetables were good.  I didn't really understand the pasta in marinara since the chicken had a sauce already on it.  Why the two completely different sauces? I asked for more bread to fill myself up because I didn't want to finish my food and it was taken away after I ate one piece.  It was terrible service and since I used a restaurant.com gift certificate, gratuity was automatically added on.  The food was terrible.  How did it get all these great reviews?  It was like one of our exes was the chef that night and wanted us to have the worst meal ever.  I don't know how else to explain the the huge difference between what we experienced and what has been written on Yelp.

I realized on New Year's Eve that I had done some terrible planning on my part and may not be able to get in to get a mani/pedi before my trip to Mexico due to most places being closed on New Year's Day.  I woke up early and headed to the closest place to where I was house sitting in hopes to beat the New Year's Eve rush.  I was able to get right in here at Paulene's.  Hannah was very friendly and did a great job.  My pedi is just now starting to look as though it needs freshening up (2 weeks have passed).  My mani started to go after a week, but I also spent a lot of time in the ocean during that week.  My only issue with this salon is that you cannot add a tip on if you are using your credit card.  I never carry cash and always use my check card.  I had to head to the atm afterward to get cash for Hannah.  I wonder how many people just end up not tipping because of this.  Be sure to bring cash before you go.  My basic mani/pedi was $40 before tip.

This is only about the pharmacy.  I'm sure most people are not too open about their medical issues or history with anyone.  We trust our doctors and should trust our pharmacists as well.   I've gone to other pharmacies where the pharmacists and assistants have not been sensitive to the situation by speaking loudly, condescendingly, or short.  I don't know about you, but that sure doesn't make me feel better when I'm sick. It's nice to have friendly, intelligent people in charge of my private information.  It's obvious they are well-educated, have helpful things to say, are well-versed, show concern and a true to desire to help.   The pharmacists and assistants here are absolutely fantastic and will drive most distances to keep my prescriptions here.

This is my favorite taco shop.  It has all the same menu items you'd expect at the prices you'd expect.  There are a million taco stands in the Phoenix area, but this one stands out to me.   Why you ask? #1 -  Their carne asada is the best I've ever had.  I'm a Phoenix native, therefore I've had A LOT of carne asada from taco stands in my life.  Hands down... the best! #2 - I've never gotten sick from this place.  I can list off numerous taco shops where I have. #3 - Kinda goes along with #2, the ingredients all seem to be fresh.  If you get sour cream, it's not curdly.  The bacon in the breakfast burritos are crispy, not chewy.  The tortillas taste like they make them there. #4 - You can call ahead and order to pick up. #5 - They have pollo asada dishes. Their food reminds me of meals I've had in Rocky Point.  Very delicious and affordable.

I try not to have any regrets in life, but i regret not going to my normal place. My friend and I needed pedicures and quality girl time together.  This place was between her and my house and I found a coupon, so we went. There's nothing special about this place.  The same prices and services as every other nail salon in the grocery store plazas. My toes look really nice, except for the chunks of skin missing around my nails.  I don't really have much cuticle down there, so that may have been the problem.  Maybe she has a routine.   It hurts to walk.  4 of my toes have scabs surrounding my nails.  Last I checked, the cuticle only grows on the bottom.   I guess that's what I get for trying to save $2.

I wish we had more people with us so that there was a reason to order everything on the menu.  My coworker called me up and said let's go to lunch.  She asked me what I was in the mood for and said I hadn't been able to stop thinking about chicken and waffles for the last week.  She said she'd been craving chicken and waffles all morning.  This is why we're friends and not just coworkers.  So we met halfway at Lo-Lo's. F-N-A-Cotton!  The nicest people ever are working here. I just wanted to skip the rest of work and just hang out all day and chat with the employees, make room for red velvet cake, and drink sweet tea.  Next time.... You must get the stupid fries.  You can share these ooooooorrrrr eat them as a meal if you don't feel like waffles.  Fries, peppers, chicken, cheese, and gravy.  There may be more things included, but it really doesn't matter because they were bomb and that's all you need to know. Mac and Cheese = BOMB Chicken and Waffles.... Really?  You need me to review this?  Amazing!! If you've never had chicken and waffles before, you have no idea what you're missing.  It's like heaven on my tongue.  Sweet sweet juicy fried chicken and waffle heaven. I can't wait until I save room to try the red velvet cake!!!

I feel so blessed that I haven't had to write a bad review lately.  One reason is I ate at Crazy Jim's!   Soooooooo good.  The hummus was creamy and you can tell freshly made.  The pita came out a little differently than I'm used to.  Instead of just warmed, it seems it was maybe fried in a little olive oil (I'm guessing) to make it a little crispier than other restaurants and tastier.  I'm a fan of this style. I got the chicken patra pita and there was so much chicken, cheese, and peppers that I had to eat it with a fork and knife.  There was no way I could pick that baby up and eat it without everything falling out.  The chicken was tender and juicy.  The tzatziki sauce was delicious.  My side salad was full of green, leafy lettuce.  Quality food.   Our server was so overly friendly too.  I can't wait to go back!   YUMMY!

This place is great.  Expect a bit of a wait during lunch time because it will be busy.  There's only a few tables inside this small restaurant so I recommend take out if you can.  One of the best gyros I've had and definitely the best on the west side.  Their prices are reasonable.  Two huge gyros, both with fries, and one fountain drink ends up being about $13.  The rest of the menu looks really good, but the gyro is so good I can't get myself to order anything other than that.

Since the place is called Gyros Place, I figure my best bet is to order a gyro.  Fantastic choice by me!   The meat was so tender and flavorful.  The pita was so soft and yummy.  There was just the right amount of tzatzaiki sauce in it.  I really only like fries if they are criss-cut or crinkle cut.  Lucky me they serve crinkle! This was probably the best gyro I've had at gyro joint in the Phoenix area.   It makes me sad it's in east Mesa and I'm hardly ever out there.

The courtyard patio is nice... They should stick with that and change everything else.  I called to make a reservation that day for two and was told they weren't taking reservations because rain was in the forecast for that night. We arrived after about 5 minutes of rain to find that they had a party of 90 that was outside that they were trying to accommodate inside. The hostess was rude and said they were trying to figure out what to do with all the people outside that had to be brought inside due to the rain and it could be up to 2 hours until we're sat. Ok. A party of 90 would have been booked well in advance. They knew there was a chance of rain and may need to accommodate them inside prior to the rain falling, that's why they weren't taking reservations, right? We asked if we could eat at the bar and were told yes, only to go to the bar and be told "no because it suddenly got slammed in the bar." So we went back and put our name in because we saw plenty of dry tables throughout the dining areas and sat at the bar and had drinks.  The bartender was friendly but we heard all the servers complaining and it was just a bad vibe all around. Thank god I was with good company here. I bought a 3 course meal for 2 on DealChicken that was going to expire and me lose my money or else we would have gone any place else. The margaritas were good. The appetizer, chorizo fundido, was good. We were done with those when it slowed down enough that the bartender said we could stay there and eat and our table was ready. We sat down at our table for a couple minutes without seeing a server and decided to go back to the bar to finish our food. The servers were confused about who was going to get our table, so it would have been a long time before we could have ordered our entrees if we didn't go back to the bar. My friend ordered tacos, which she had one and took the rest home since she was full on the appetizer and so much time passed between courses. I ordered the pollo margarita which was a little dry, but good. The potato thing was nasty. The chocolate cake we took to go and ate the next day was good.  There's hundreds of restaurants in Old Town and this does not compete against any of them. If you want terrible food and service and a great patio, this is the place. If you go just a couple blocks northeast, you'll find great Mexican food, good service, and a great patio at a different restaurant. There's plenty of competition and this place must get by on a reputation from years ago, because it sucks now.

I claim to be the best Arizona native that there is, yet I failed to visit Durant's until I was 30 years old.  Shame on me.   Durant's has been around since dinosaurs and now it's just off the light rail.  I love when things come full circle.   Anyway, time to be serious.  So the front door is actually the back door that goes through the kitchen and gives me anxiety that I will knock a waiter out or piss off the chef for not wearing a hair net.  Once you get into the dining room, it's easier to breathe.  The decor is very Frank Sinatra chic.  Who doesn't love giant rounded leather booths, wood and brocade walls, and chairs whose fabric is attached with the giant nailheads? I had the prime rib, which melted in my mouth.  We also had an amazing strawberry shortcake that I couldn't force enough in my mouth fast enough.  I also had the luck to be in the restaurant on a rare night that they gave their patrons a token good for free desserts for the rest of your life.  Oh yes, be jealous.

I grew up on German/Austrian food being that my grandmother was from Austria.  Since she passed away, I've been trying to find a place that could provide me the food I've missed so much.  Thank you to the Hofbrauhaus for doing so. I was like a kid in a candy store.  Actually, I felt like a child at Christmas.  We ordered the platter to share plus bread and potato dumplings.  The potato dumplings were almost as good as my grandma made.  (she sometimes put meat in the center of hers).  The gravy was perfect on top.  The roast beef and pork chop was just the way I love them.  I wasn't a big fan of the sausage, but it was still good.   The live band sang a mix of Bavarian and American songs calling out for social drinks.  The people stood on the tables singing and drinking.  Others danced the polka.  It was just like Christmas.  The only thing that was annoying was the servers' outfits.  Bavarian women do have other outfits where their cleavage doesn't hang out. If you grew up in a family like mine, the food and the music will definitely make you feel at home.  If you are not familiar with this, you might think this restaurant a little goofy.

Why did it take me so long to come here??  I've heard about Delux since it opened and finally made it here.   I quickly browsed over the menu and saw they have a "Delux Burger."  Namesake = Order.  So I did.  Along with a half order of half fries and half sweet potato fries. I make some of the best decisions ever made.  The fries are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  They are on the skinnier side of the fry spectrum, but not the skinniest I've had.  I love crispy fries.  These were the best, I said it, BEST sweet potato fries I've ever consumed. Onto the burger... I ordered mine medium but would have preferred medium well.  It was a bit pinker than I'm used to for medium.  It was delicious, nonetheless.  I'm not a big fan of arugula, but could hardly taste it because the flavors from the cheese, beef, bacon, and onions.  It was definitely a gourmet burger.   They offered tasting flights of beer that we had to talk ourselves out of since we were having lunch during a work day.  I can't wait to go back and be able to enjoy a beer with a burger.  Yum!!

It was a 30 minute wait for a table, but were told we could dine at the bar.  The bartenders were really friendly.  There were signs at the video poker machines at the bar stating if you play $1 bets and put at least $20 in the machine, you'll drink for free.  Well, I put a lot more money in AND paid for my drinks.  Whatever, I wasn't going to be that person demanding free drinks.  They should take the signs down if they are going charge because I'm sure there's plenty of hillbillies that will complain. The food was ok.  I just got a quesadilla that I won't write home or Yelp about.  Pops got a pork green chile burrito that he said was cold.  This was surprising because we got our food in like 5 minutes.  I'd figure it would be piping hot.  Can you say "already made and thrown into the microwave?"   So I won't be back.  Too many fabulous restaurants in fabulous Las Vegas to spend my pennies here.

It took me way too long to make it here.  Many years ago I was at an event where Cibo was sampling food along with many other restaurants.  They were hands down the best food I had at that event.  I took their information and planned to go there for a full meal and never did.   I am so disappointed in myself that it took so long to get here.  I took my boss here for lunch on a beautiful Phoenix day.  It would have been great to eat outside, but we opted for inside instead.  It's an old downtown house converted, like so many awesome places downtown, into a restaurant.  It's cozy and unpretentious.  A+ for atmosphere. Just an fyi, during lunch, pizza is not served.  That just means I have to come back for dinner.  (Hopefully it won't take me another 5 years to do that).  At lunch, their delicious sandwiches and salads are available.  If you're not with your boss, you can also get a glass of pinot noir or chardonnay for $3.  I got a delicious lemonade and found a breakfast sandwich on the menu:  eggs, spinach, and ricotta on wood fired bread.  So good.  I got the fruit salad as my side which was yogurt, granola, and fruit.  My lunch ended up being two items I make myself for breakfast all the time, but elevated to gourmet deliciousness.  I can only strive to make my breakfast or lunch this great.  My boss got the pastrami sandwich and fruit salad and thanked me for bringing me here. Looking at the reviews, I need to come back for dinner, brunch, and dessert.  I can't wait and definitely won't.

Want to impress someone?  Take them to dinner on the patio at sunset at Chelsea's Kitchen. I've been here for drinks and appetizers with friends before and finally returned for a dinner date.  It was fantastic as expected.  We sat on the patio near the fireplace shortly before sunset.  We were able to enjoy our cocktails in daylight and then dinner under the Christmas lights.  Speaking of cocktails, they have a fantastic wine list, selection of craft beers, and I enjoyed a delicious vodka lemonade. Our server was so friendly and polite.  My prime rib, potatoes, and vegetables was so delicious.  My date's house made french fries were great and he said his burger was tasty. I love this place.  My date was way impressed with me to say the least.

We all know Ticoz for lunch or dinner is fantastic.  Did you know they serve fantastic breakfast on the weekend? Oh yes, it's amazing.  First off, you can order a mimosa, bloody Mary, screwdriver, or cape cod for $1.99.  The orange juice in my mimosa tasted fresh and the champagne was not super dry like many other places use in their mimosas.  I'd say it was the largest and tastiest mimosa I've ever had. To eat, we shared the frittata with chicken sausage and peppers and the French toast sticks with bacon and fruit.  The frittata was light and fluffy.  The chicken sausage was not heavy or greasy.  The peppers were not too spicy.  It came with crispy breakfast potatoes.  Yum.  The French toast sticks reminded me of funnel cake:  soft on the inside, crispy outside, and just the right amount of sweet.  The fresh fruit entailed strawberries and cantaloupe.   Our two entree, 6 mimosa breakfast was just over $30.  It was fulfilling yet light enough that we felt fine getting in our swimsuits later.  A great choice for breakfast/brunch.

Threw a baby shower here and it was awesome!!  It was raining out, so the beautiful courtyard was out.  We instead had the private dining room which was perfect!  There was about 15 of us and there was plenty of room for everyone plus all the presents.   Our server was awesome.  Very patient and ran everything by me to make sure everything came out at the right time.  There was no issue setting up the bill so each person was responsible for cocktails and one check for the food.   Everyone loved the food, of course.  I loved not having to host at my house and clean.  They had no problem with me bringing in cupcakes, although they said the chef/owner can make a mean cake for special occassions.  There's a good chance I will throw a private party here again and will definitely try out the cake. Another plus for Ticoz!!

Our junior suite was beautiful.   We were on the 31st floor and had a large balcony overlooking a great view of Harmon, Planet Hollywood, and the north part of the strip.  We had a king bed and a sofa bed.  Since it could fit 4, it really needs more closet or drawer space.  There is a large jet tub, shower, double sinks, and separate toilet in the bathroom.  The main room had a wet bar area, mini fridge, stove, microwave, coffee maker and sink. We stayed in tower one.  The convenient store, restaurant, and Starbucks was in tower three, a short walk away.  They do have 24 hour room service, however.  Our tower did have it's own pool area and the MGM Grand's Wet Republic was a short walk away.  There is no casino and it's a long wait for a taxi.  In fact, they have no taxi line, so it was a little disorganized on Saturday night with the guests waiting for a cab all over the front area. It was a very nice hotel for the price.  I doubt that I would stay here again.  I think I prefer to be more on the strip in the middle of the action or in a hotel with a casino while I'm in Las Vegas.

I've never reviewed The Vig?!!?!?  That's so strange.   Well, by this time in my life, I've eaten pretty much everything on the menu and continue to come back.  So the food is good. The patio is awesome.  Go on a slower night, say Monday or Tuesday, and find some chill musicians setting the mood with plenty of space to spread out.   Sunday afternoons are a packed happy mess and you don't really get to experience the awesomeness this place really has. If you don't want to valet, just park in the giant parking lot across the street and take the shoelace express on over.

Long ago, I went to a great little cafe in uptown Phoenix. We had dinner in a courtyard with a fountain, live music, and a ballet school next to it. I couldn't remember what the place was called or where it was at to save my life. So I never returned...  Years later, I started my search to go back to that great little cafe, only to find out it changed to Fuego Bistro. I was sad at first, until I saw the menu online. Soooooo up my alley. I love delicious spicy mixes of Latin and American cuisines. Restaurant week came and Fuego was on the list and they were including a cocktail with our 3 course dinner. Hells yeah!! Definitely my kind of place!  Here's the meal rundown:  1st course: I got the empanada. So sad it wasn't empanadas. I could eat these for every meal for the rest of my life and never once complain of monotony. My buddy got the tostadas. Lucky him, he got two. I stole some of his beef that was on top and it was melt in my mouth delicious. So far, 2 for 2.  2nd course: I got the chili relleno with jalapeno creamed corn and chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes. O-M-G!!!! I don't even know where to start. The corn definitely had a kick and was made sweet white corn which added a nice balance to the spice. I have since bought sweet white corn and jalapenos to try to recreate these. It won't be as good; but that just means I'll be heading back. If I could make mashed potatoes this good, I'd move to Idaho. The chili relleno was bomb-diggity. Chicken, black beans, cheese, love.  My friend had the signature pernil asado and the same sides as me. I hardly got the chance to try his he ate it so fast. Signature for a reason. YUMMMMMMY!  Score: 4 for 4.  3rd course: I got the horchata chocolate chip bread pudding. I was so full I could not fully appreciate this giant plate of wonderfulness. My friend got the creme brulee and it was just as fantastic, but I'm going to say this round goes to the bread pudding.  6 for 6.  As for the included cocktail, I had the white sangria. I love sangria. It was a perfect blend of sweet and crisp and didn't have too much fruit or wine flavor to it. It was strong and I could only make it through one.  The server was super friendly, the atmosphere fantastic, the food to die for, and the drinks strong and delicious. I'm surprised this place isn't constantly packed with an hour wait. Definitely a new favorite. I'm so happy it's not that old cafe I was searching for.

They call themselves the Original because they have nothing to do with the gross-o chain Garcias.   It's so good.  I work in the southwest valley, so I have endless choices for Mexican food.  This is the only Mexican restaurant I'll eat at in my area.  In fact, whenever the boss man comes out to work with me, it's the only place he'll eat at too.  He eats healthy and I do too, well on weekdays.  There are a few options on the menu that won't weigh you down the rest of the day.  Dishes with fish, black beans, chicken breasts, spinach, etc, made with delicious Mexican flavors.  Ofcourse there are the weigh downs as well.  Looove the chimichanga.   It's huge and cozy inside and don't let the area scare you.  It's on the main road and you're safe if you're there during operating hours.

There are no words great enough to describe how the cupcakes at OllieCake tasted or made me feel eating them. For many years I've driven past Urban Cookies at times when they have been closed.  I kept saying to myself, "You need to go here during the day and try this place out."  After finding out the owners are ASU alumni, I demanded that I go and support this local business owned by fellow Sun Devils.  OH MY GOD was I disappointed I hadn't come here sooner.   I bought the vegan banana and brown velvet for myself and a carrot cake and brown velvet for my dad.  I couldn't wait to get to my dad's house to eat one.  I ate the banana in my car while I was driving and had to pull over.  It was so moist and so delicious.  It was a banana cupcake, not banana bread with frosting on top.  Just awesome. I set down my dad's for him and asked him to eat them and tell me if he thought Sprinkles is better.  Before he ate one, he looked at me like I was crazy for asking that question.  (He's a big fan of Sprinkles).  He started eating them and said, "I think they beat Sprinkles."  OllieCake cupcakes are not as large as Sprinkles, but there is enough goodness to satisfy you.   Oh OllieCake.... How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways...........

I had to get the windshield on my company car replaced at a location near this nail salon. I had 2 hours to kill and the location is a little far from my house or anyone I know to have them come pick me up or kill some time with me, so I walked across the street to Starbucks. Before I made it to get coffee, I came across Perfect Nails. A mani/pedi would waste enough time until my windshield was done so I thought I would pop in and see what the wait would be. It was midday on a Saturday, so figured it may be a while, but they were able to see me right away.  This probably the nicest nail salon I've ever been to that isn't a full service salon or spa. The location is decorated very tastefully in neutral colors and recessed lighting. They have flat screens on each wall for guests to watch while getting their services. The pedicure chairs were comfortable and I could figure out the settings on the chair.  There was probably 20 nail technicians working there, which explained how I could be seen so quickly where there were already 15 clients getting worked on. My technician was nice, very quiet, and I apologize I don't remember her name. Prior to beginning my pedicure, she placed a disposable plastic liner in the bowl. I thought this was a fantastic idea because it keeps the bowls clean; however, somewhat wasteful. It makes sense for them to be efficient in serving the number of clients they had coming in so they aren't wasting time cleaning the bowls properly.  She did a great job doing my pedicure and manicure. She was smart and asked me to pay before she painted my finger nails. Most places ask after and rummage through your purse for you. The spa pedicure and manicure cost $40 which is about the same as any other corner nail salon. Although they weren't that friendly, most employees at any comparable salons have the same demeanor. I was comfortable there and did not worry once about cleanliness, so would definitely recommend this location for discount nail services.  If I find myself in that area again in need of a mani or pedi, I will use them.

I've had 3 dentists in my life. 3rd has definitely been the charm. This location is not near me by any means, but I'm completely content with driving out of my way to have Dr. Reese Turner be my dentist.  He is very professional, does not push to have things done I am not comfortable doing, keeps me informed of everything I need done and the process in order to do those, and his chair side manner is top notch. We went through 3 crowns until we were both satisfied with how it fit in my mouth and I was only charged for one. I feel confident I'm in educated, caring hands that's not out to rip me off.  The ladies up front are always friendly and helpful as well. If you're looking for a dentist, stop your search and go here.

I wouldn't even give them one star. I took my fleet vehicle there for the scheduled oil change.  Jiffy Lube is an authorized location and I chose this location only because I drove by it.  I pulled up and told them I only needed an oil change and probably wouldn't even need an air filter.  The manager immediately asked me if it was a fleet vehicle and which one.  He then told me he'd do what the fleet company authorizes at my mileage.  I told him I only wanted an oil change. My fleet company authorizes quite a bit to be done when brought in to Jiffy Lubes, but that doesn't mean it all needs to be done at the visit.  The manager went ahead and changed the oil, along with the windshield wipers, and rotated the tires.  The tires had just been rotated and the wipers had just been replaced.  He did not ask me if I needed these things, nor did I ask for them.  The only thing I authorized was an oil change.  He was doing anything he could to push the cost of the services to the max my fleet company allows.   When he came back in, he did not tell me what he did, I had to see it on the receipt.  I said "$100 for an oil change?"  He replied saying he did what the fleet authorizes.  I told him I get the information as to what is authorized and that is why I only asked for an oil change. This was the manager doing this, so I couldn't very well complain to the manager about the shady tactics to take advantage of my fleet company.  I'm sure he does the same things to other customers; however, it is with their hard earned money.  I'm sure people who don't know much about vehicle maintenance believe it really costs $100 for an oil change.  Do not go here unless you want to get lied to and ripped off. I've had great experiences with other Jiffy Lubes, that I will now go out of my way to get my scheduled fleet maintenance at.  I will never go here.  You should never ever go here either.

Wow! I'm so disappointed in myself for not dining or even drinking here before now.  We came in for brunch one Sunday. It was too warm for the patio we walked through to get inside, but believe you me I'm counting down the days until the temps are in double digits again to enjoy that beautifully cozy space. Sigh... I was a little sad we wouldn't be able to enjoy the patio but was snapped back into happiness when we walked in to the smell of bacon. Sweet sweet bacon. In case you didn't know, when you walk into a restaurant to the smell of bacon, that means an angel's earned their wings. The restaurant is bright and open and the servers are friendly and helpful.  On to their moneymakers... First off, carafe of mimosas for $6?!?!?!? They are tugging on my heart strings. The carafe holds about 4 mimosas... do the math. (I won't tell you how many the two of us had). Gosh, I love taking advantage of deals. Speaking of deals, pretty much everything on the menu is less than $10. My friend got the special, a tender belly that took 30 hours to prepare. It was $7.95. It came with pickled vegetables that we didn't care for, but I don't like anything pickled. The tender-belly was so tender and delicious. Since we had bacon on the brain, we got a couple sides of bacon between the two of us. (Just like the mimosas, I'll never tell how many). The chef came out to meet the guests whom were after his heart by ordering the tender belly with sides of bacon. Who doesn't love meeting the chef? It really shows that they care about their guests and what they think about their products. I had the quiche of the day that was freaking amazing. We needed something sweet after all that delicious, hearty food; so we shared the cookie dough with ice cream. This is my favorite dessert anywhere... the sort-of baked chocolate chip cookie dough with vanilla ice cream on top. I was in heaven.  This brunch was one of the best I have had ever! I love brunch... It's my favorite meal. I'll definitely have to come back when the nights are cooler and check out the dinner menu on the patio. LalalalalalalaLOVE this place!!!!

I've been coming here for a couple years now for the service on my fleet vehicle. The people here are so flipping nice. They complete service quickly.   They've never tried to sell me on something fake I need to have done. I've never gotten the dishonest vibe I get at a lot of other service places. They're lobby/waiting area is fairly cozy as well for being surrounded by tires.   I usually use coupons for random other places for the service on my personal vehicle, but am planning on switching to paying full price to come here. There's a reason everyone has rated them 5 stars. Don't get sub-par service or ripped off by going someplace else.

Love!!  I love! Man almost all my senses were heightened during this show.   It was just beautiful.   My dad teared up a bit watching it. Even if you're not a Beatles fan, you will love it. It's amazing how it brings together pop culture, dance, music, visual effects, acrobatics, and humor to pull at your heart strings. I got 20% off my ticket looking for deals on Mirage's website. I also saw later 50% off deals through Travelzoo.com.  Still, well worth the $115 I paid.   We sat in section 209  row N and our seats were perfect!  We were included in the special effect and had a great view of everything going on. Amazing!  My dad said he wants to make seeing it an annual thing.

Anytime I've been here, shenanigans have been afoot.   There's friendly drunks, dancing cougars (have you noticed middle aged white people all have the same shimmy dance moves?), live music, and friendly servers. I like this bar.

This salon is small and unpretentious; so able to focus on number 1, ME! (You, if you take my recommendation).  I trust my hair to any of the stylists there. They all are always continuing their education and I always see quality work being done there.  I personally see Tina and hope to never have to see anyone else before I die. She has been doing my hair for over a decade. The woman is awesome!! If I ask her to do something to my hair that won't work out, she let's me know it won't work out. She will let me know why it won't work out and suggest something similar that will work out.  I've never been unhappy with her work. I've never gone a few months without someone telling me something positive about my hair and ask me where I go.  Everyone there is friendly and that snobby salon vibe is definitely NOT there. (The coffee, tea, and brownies are awesome as well)

Ultra feast at its finest!! After viewing an option for breakfast pizza on their brunch menu online, we just had to go.  Nobody can deny that the 2 most delicious and important meals of the day are breakfast and pizza meal.  Combine the 2, AMAZING!! We also had the French toast with blueberry cream cheese and maple syrup.  Did I mention the bread was French with raisins and pecans?  Oh yes, you should be jealous of my Sunday brunch. We also shared some yummy potatoes and giant pieces of crispy bacon.  I couldn't properly review this establishment without trying half the menu.  I would be doing you Yelpers a disservice. The $3 mimosas and bloody Maris were a fabulous deal to accompany our ultra feast. We had stragglers in our party, all women, but they didn't make us wait until everyone arrived to seat us.  (I hate that.  Let me sit down and drink).  Our server was fantastic, friendly, and on top of everything.  He was also friendly to the baby in our party.  Servers normally hate children.   It's just off the light rail route.  There isn't anything negative I can say about this place.  My stomach is so happy I took it here!!

One of the few places I will go on the west side and, of course, I'm about to tell you why. First off, it's not at Westgate.  People have been shot and kill partying at Westgate.  Who wants to go there?  Not me.  I love my life!!   If you're headed to a Cardinals game and don't want to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a parking pass nor tailgate at Westgate where people die, you should go to the Sandbar.  There's free parking at the fancy Park West shopping center AAAAAAAND the fine folks at Sandbar will escort you in their bus over to stadium when you've had your fill of build your own bloody Marys and tacos.  Don't worry, they'll pick you up from the game and bring you safely back to your car. Speaking of the bus, if you live nearby, you can call and have them pick you up and take you home.  Now that's a classy bar.  They're concerned about your good time and safety. Depending on the night, or day, you go, you can totally get a different vibe.  Up for a crazy night of dancing?  Go on a Friday or Saturday night.  Feel like chillaxing on a patio?  Go during happy hour.  Feel like some karaoke?  There's a night for that too.  There's even great live music during Friday happy hour.  It's safe, friendly, the margaritas are strong, the vodka is well priced, the tacos are yummy... It's a good thing I don't live closer or else I'd probably never leave.

Yummmmmmmmm!!!  Don't look at the prices - It's a restaurant on the strip.  Expect to drop some cash (duh, you're in Vegas). They have crispy waffle fries!!  The best! Full bar A+ Milkshake bar!!!  Awesome if that's your thing.  My dad said his fruity milkshake was delicious and finished it in probably 4 seconds. My dad kept talking about his burger and how good it was.  I got the special chicken sandwich with avocados, bacon, and special sauce.  It was so good.  The bun was toasted perfectly on the inside and soft on the outside.   It was almost as gourmet as burgers and sandwiches can be.

So I returned again in hopes to have that dining experience all my friends rave about.  It was better than my first visit.  My entree was not an overcooked piece of meat.  Actually, I took my friend's advice and went with a seafood pasta dish:  squid ink pasta with mussels, pork jowls, chili, mint, and I think that's it.  It was amazing!  Squid ink pasta is a little frightening at first because nobody really wants to eat something that's black (black usually equals rotten) but it was so delicious and I patted myself on the back for going adventurous that evening.   The menu is always changing which is good but also disappointing to find out I couldn't have the delicious calamari again.   We dined with a Groupon and I feel that's the only way your bill will be priced fairly.  If you don't have a Groupon, I suggest the Sunday dinner or tasting menu to get the best for your money.

I love this place.  If you're looking for comfort breakfast food like biscuits and gravy or steak and eggs, and a couple pounds of it, this is your place.  The menu includes French toast, biscuits and gravy, shit on a shingle, about 15 different omelets, steak and eggs, chicken fried steak and eggs, Belgian waffles, breakfast burritos, etc and lunch items. With almost every breakfast, you get real home-style potatoes and choice of bread. If I go here, I don't eat the rest of the day. Every entree is less than $10 and if you come weekdays before 10:30, there's quite a few specials under $5. Awesome feeling to be full all day for less than $10.  I've being coming here for about 4 years and is my go to for a hangover meal or a hearty meal with my dad.

Wowee my taste buds were so happy last night!!  The Tuck Shop calls their cuisine "neighborhood comfort food" and they are right in so many ways. The restaurant is located in a neighborhood. In fact, it looks like an old house and doesn't stand out at all except the small "Tuck Shop" neon on the west side of the building. Since it probably was a house at one time, its pretty small. I don't think I saw more than 10 tables. When we arrived, the very friendly host stated it could be up to 45 minutes for a table or at the bar. We stated we'd think about it and surveyed the people waiting and where the guests were at in their meals. The host returned to let us know that the guests at the tables were finishing up faster than he thought, let us know how many were ahead of us, and let us know we could enjoy some cocktails while we waited.  We ordered two vodka lemonades and they were awesome. The menu stated it was homemade lemonade and it was delicious. Not too sweet, not too sour, not too tart, and not too much alcohol. We maybe got 1/4 of the way through our drinks when the host returned to let us know there was room at the bar for us.  Our bartender/server was very friendly and attentive. We like to order a little of everything and share when we try a new restaurant in order to give an accurate recommendation or decide to return. From the starters, we ordered the herbed potato fries with Gruyere cheese and mushroom gravy; from small plates, we ordered times mac and cheese with crispy prosciutto and herbed breadcrumbs and added lobster; and from the sharing menu, we ordered the citrus-brined fried chicken with white cheddar waffles.  The fries were cut steak size and had the perfect balance of crispy outside and soft inside. The cheese had a surprising kick to it. The mushroom gravy was soooooooooo good and reminded me of what my grandma would make.  The mac and cheese was fantastic. I wasn't a fan of the lobster, but I'm not really a fan of lobster period. It was added to the top of it rather than mixed in. I recommend not adding the lobster; there's plenty of flavor with the breadcrumbs and prosciutto. A few bites into the mac and cheese, we started to get pretty full and our server actually asked us if we wanted to cancel the chicken and waffles. No way any other restaurant would cancel and extra sale. We told her to bring it out because we had to try it.  God I'm glad we did. The waffles were fluffy and sweet. The chicken was juicy and tender. It all went together so amazingly I couldn't stop myself from eating it.  I'm happy we got to try so many delicious dishes and look forward to our next visit when I'll only order one item in order to save room for dessert. The people next to us did and it looked phenomenal. We still got to indulge on chocolate chip cookie dough balls that were given to us, rather than mints, with our check. Speaking of check, the 2 vodka lemonades and three dishes came out to about 54 bucks. A smoking deal considering we ate way too much.  The Tuck Shop knew the exact route to my heart.

What a fantastic happy hour!! I arrived about 4:30 and it was happy hour and it ended at 6. I have no idea when it officially starts, sorry.  All draft beer pints are $2.50 except Bud Light which is $2.00. The beers on draft included Stella Artois, Drop Top, Four Peaks, and some others I can't remember because I don't drink beer. I had a delicious glass of summer sangria made from white wine and it was very refreshing. I also had a sweet tea vodka cocktail and they were each $5. They also had a huge selection of wines that were $5 a glass. Happy enough for you?  NO??? Well, we also indulged in a happy hour priced, $3, small Caesar salad. It was basic and delicious. Romaine, celery, croutons, lemon juice, and an unfishy Caesar dressing. My friends then each had a happy hour sized (8 inches) pepperoni pizza for $5. I found a coupon on their website for a $7.95 pizza, so I got the 11 inch meatball pizza. The meatballs were AWESOME!!! I think the pie needed to be cooked a bit longer to be strong enough to support those big balls. I had a fork and knife, so I went about eating it that way. The upper crust was somewhat buttery and the crispness was just right.  The service was great as well. We sat at the bar and the bartender asked each of us our names, shook our hands, and then remembered our names and what we wanted when we would request anything from him.  3 salads, 3 pizzas, 2 beers, and 2 cocktails for about $50?!?!?! Unheard of. I'm definitely a fan. A super fan of their happy hour.

Mmmmmmmm chocolate martinis. I can go on for days about the MonteLucia.  I don't know that I should because I want it all for myself.  I'm a local and enjoy coming here to cozy up with friends outside in the courtyard or inside on the couches while sipping on A-MAZING chocolate martinis.   The staff is attentive and friendly.  Everytime I've been there live music has been playing that could be described as jazzy or loungey. It's the perfect upscale location for a low key evening.

They only serve sangria on Sundays at the Arcadia Postino.  *SAD FACE*  It would be nice to have a sangria at either location on Sunday (or any other day at that). I still love Postino's!!  (who doesn't though?)

The food was good, but the service was so horrible, I won't give this place a second chance. We came in for Sunday brunch and were sat at a hightop right next to the bar.  The air conditioning was on high, freezing, and the vent was right above the table.  I mentioned the gale force freezing a/c to the hostess that sat us and she told me it was the wind.   So we sat freezing for about 5 minutes wondering if we had a server or if the bartenders were our servers, if we should go to the bar to order when our server finally arrived.  We ordered two cocktails and two waters.  We received the cocktails but no waters.   While we waited for our breakfast, another server dropped off a couple sodas on our table and ran off.  They weren't ours.  The bartender walked by, and we asked to order another cocktail and waters from her, and we let her know the drinks weren't ours and she took them and brought us our drinks and finally water .  (On our way out, we saw those drinks at the table next to ours, so they were close). We waited about a half an hour for our food to arrive.  My friend got the Hangover and I got the day's special French toast.  When our server dropped off the food, he said he'd return with syrup for the French toast.  My friend wanted more gravy for her dish and planned to ask the server for it when he brought the syrup.  Well 25 minutes passed and I never got the syrup, he never returned to the table, and my friend got annoyed.  The French toast had pineapples on it, so it was sweet enough without the maple syrup, so I didn't miss it.  The French toast was really good.  My friend's Hangover dish really needed that extra gravy she wanted.   We told the bartender we wanted the check.  He dropped it off and tried to run off.  I yelled at him to come back because I already had my card out.  When he brought back the check for me to sign, he thanked me us for our patience.  He didn't address why he came to our table 4 times total (to take our drink order, take our food order, drop off our food, and drop off our check).  I didn't want to leave him any tip at all. The food was good, but needed something extra that unfortunately we weren't able to get because we had no server and we have no access to the kitchen. I had a lot of hopes for the restaurant named after my favorite breakfast meat.  I hate being disappointed.

Mmmmmmm pizza.   We came here for girlfriend lunch on a Tuesday and sat at a table in the bar.  It wasn't as busy as I thought it would be at lunchtime near the busy Biltmore business area.  The space is beautiful, keeping true to many of the designs of mid-century buildings found in this area of town with a modern update.   The pizza was great.  We shared a pepperoni that was definitely cooked in a fire oven.  Delicious!  What has had me craving since that visit, however, was a starter.  We shared a cauliflower gratinata.  Yeah, that's right.  I'm craving CAULIFLOWER.  The veggies are baked with cheese and breadcrumbs.  It's just like old fashioned macaroni and cheese, but with a little bit of nutritional value to it.  All that cheese counteracts any good the cauliflower would give your body; but my reasoning suggests the lack of pasta makes this dish an awesome healthier alternative to the old comfort food staple.  I'm hooked and will be back for dinner when I can enjoy some wine with my pizza and cauliflower.

The name says it all.  Terrible. I guess you pay the consequences for being cheap and stopping at the first place we drove past.  $10 for a tiny buffet with the normal free hotel food:  wet eggs, funky already made omelets, oval hashbrowns, thin bacon, and funky fruit salad.  They had a carving station with dry meat that was recommended I "put a lot of barbecue sauce on it because it helps make it better" by an employee.   We did get a lot of champagne.  The only good thing.   My stomach was very angry at me for filling it with what this place tried to convince us was food.

The wings are huuuuuge!  The spicy ranch sauce we chose is delish.  If you are a fan of REAL buffalo wings, then you will appreciate these monsters. The pizza was ok.  The crust was crunchy and tasty and there was probably a pound of toppings on the small thing.   Absolute heavenly dessert in the magic brownie.  I still can't believe we had pizza, wings, 2 drinks, and a brownie for less than $20.   I definitely don't see myself craving the pizza, but I've been dreaming about the wings ever since.   It really doesn't bother me to stop at my bank's atm beforehand or eat on the table outside or in the comfort of my home.  But that's because the food is worth it and I'm not high maintenance.

I'm surprised I never wrote a review for Hula's..... Well, better late than never! Hula's has yummy food and a yummy vibe.  The interior is fun and feels contemporary island.  There's a large patio for those mild nights and wintertime. The best thing about Hula is their Caesar salads.  Most of the entrees have an option for Caesar salad or sweet potato fries or something else.  Please get the Caesar salad.  If you must, then go with the sweet potato fries.  Or, you can do like my friend and I, and split a chicken Caesar salad and black bean burger with a side of sweet potato fries.  Not only will the kitchen split everything for you, you get the best of everything.   On the last visit, we had the two entrees and four vodka cocktails and our bill was about $55.  I'd say that's a smoking deal.   It's right off of the light rail and I hear they have an amazing brunch.  I can't wait to get up early enough on the weekend to try it!

I've been here twice and both times enjoyed my food and service.  It seems the people most disappointed were the ones who saw the place on TV or had a coupon.  Maybe that's why I liked it so much.  Neither one of those applied to me so I wasn't expecting to be served golden eggs on a silver platter for half price.  I just expected a good breakfast and they delivered with great service both times.   I've had an omelet and the jalapeno cheddar biscuits and gravy.  Both very yummy.  The biscuits and gravy is a very large serving and I prefer mine with eggs.  It was waaaaaay too much food.  Both times I had the iced coffee and I thought it was great iced coffee.  To those comments about just asking for coffee and putting ice in it.... wouldn't that make an iced coffee?  If you want an iced latte or frappucino, you should go to Starbucks.  If you want an iced coffee, rather than hot, with your delicious breakfast, order the iced coffee at Over Easy.  I can't wait to try so many other things on the menu.  Like chicken and waffles, waffle dogs, brioche stack, or the chilaquiles.  I'm pretty certain I won't be disappointed by any of them.

The clothes are awesome.  The prices are awesome.   So why 2 stars?  Customer service.  Obviously all the employees are there to get a discount on already cheap clothes because they don't acknowledge you.  There's attitude when you ask for a dressing room.  Attitude when you're checking out.  It's like I'm bothering them by shopping there and providing them a job and paycheck. Hopefully the staff will be better at Fashion Square when that location opens.  I love H&M but hate the negativity in that store.

Fantastic!!!   Ride your bikes up here for a drink in the front yard or on the front porch.   Enjoy the delicious BLT or the Acapulco Cheesesteak like I have.  You could definitely share one of these sandwiches with a friend.   They have a sandwich called "The Jive Turkey" which I think is reason enough to come here. What makes downtown Phoenix so cool?  Places like this.

This place made me want to smoke cigars, drink dirty stirred martinis, and listen to jazz music.  Large high back chairs, booths, and couches surround the center bar along with a couple fireplaces.    This place is dark and cozy.  Definitely a sexy place to sip some scotch before a night on the town. We sampled pretty much everything on the menu.  Everything was good.  No dishes really wowed me.  The decor and the drinks, however, wowed me.  I hear they have live music too, so I only recommend this place to relax over some cocktails.

I've been going to dermatologists since I was a wee lass.  My main man retired and I relied on my family physician to treat my skin until a couple years ago.  As an AZ native with pasty white skin, blond hair, and blue eyes; I am at high risk for those pesky skin cancers.  (It doesn't help that I used to lay in tanning beds as a teenager.  Don't do that!)  I wanted to get a skin cancer screening by a dermatologist and chose one that was listed in Phoenix Magazine's top doctors issue.   Here's what happened at the ranked office visit:  The medical assistant seemed like an idiot.  The things she said seemed appropriate for a 14 year old to say.  I was instructed to just take my top off and sit up straight while I'm examined.  I asked if I needed to take my pants off so my feet, legs, and lower back could be examine.  The response I got was, "Do you have moles you're concerned about in those areas?" What the heck?  I'm not concerned with any because I'm not a doctor examining them.  A mole ended up being removed and I wasn't told any care information for it.  It's a big scary hole... care information should be given.  It came back dysplastic which means I'm ok but need to get checked every year.  Considering that visit didn't seem as professional as I'd like, I went searching for a new dermatologist for the next exam. I looked up dermatologists on my insurance site and came across North Valley Dermatology.  They have a website and I was happy to read about the office ahead of time and felt comfortable making an appointment.  I also noticed majority of the staff is women; so knew they wouldn't be uncomfortable checking my entire body.   The office is large and beautiful and have the Travel Channel on in the waiting room (better than the crappy pharmaceutical commercials I've seen in other offices)  The ladies checking you in are very friendly.  I did not wait long before my name was called. The doctor was very friendly and I felt comfortable explaining all my issues to her, and not just having her complete the mole screening.  I took my clothes off, except my panties, and laid down while she checked every mole.  It was thorough just as it should be.  There was one surface mole she was concerned about.  Since it had to be surgically removed, I made a future appointment for that. During the surgery appointment, she went over everything that was going to happen during the procedure and what to expect afterward.  I didn't feel a thing, but did get a mental picture of what was going on and broke out into the cold sweats.  After they were finished, they brought me juice and water and were so concerned about me.  I let them know the cold sweats happen often when something is going through my skin and it wasn't anything they did.  (Another tangent: one time I broke out in the cold sweats and saw stars while blood was drawn and I asked to lay down and they told me to go sit back in the waiting room with all the sick people until I was ready to go)  I appreciated them showing concern.  They gave me instructions verbally and then again on paper on how to care for the wound.  As I checked out, I let the gal know what happened as we were chatting.  She too asked if I wanted a water and said I could relax on the couch in the aesthetic side as long as I needed to before driving home. I'm pretty sure my search is over for a dermatologist.

So the address on here shows 83rd and Glendale, but the actual location in on 83rd and Indian School.  They also do a mobile stand, so maybe the address on here is the owner's home address, because it looks like a residential address. This place is great.  My boss is from Tucson and kept telling me I have to try Sonoran dogs.  I work in the southwest valley and many people at my accounts tell me about their family members that sell delicious Sonoran dogs from their mobile carts at night.  Well I work during the day, so those wouldn't work for me until one of my accounts told me one of the about the best Sonoran dog cart that also has a store on 83rd and Indian School.   I paid them a visit and discovered the most delicious hot dog ever.  A Sonoran dog is a hot dog wrapped in bacon, fried and placed in a bollilo roll and then covered in goodness.  There's ketchup, mustard, beans, tomatoes, onions, and probably more delicious goodness I can't remember.  It sounds overwhelming, but they are sooooo tasty.  $3 for one or they were having a special $5 for two.  I just got one and a bottle of coke and I was full.   They restaurant is small and not fancy.  You order at the counter and there are a few tables inside and a few tables outside to eat at.  The woman who took my order was friendly and bilingual.  They take cash and cards.  If you are looking for authentic Sonoran dogs, this would be the place.

I didn't come here to party, I came here to eat and my taste buds thanked me for it.  It's true what Michael V said about the employees distracting each other. But I don't expect good service in Old Town Scottsdale and if you're smart you wouldn't either. It was sometimes hard to flag attention for a drink or even get an entree out with everyone else's food or within 15 minutes of everyone else's food. For some reason I'm looking past it.  This food was really good. Maybe because I hadn't eaten carbs like this in a long time they went into shock, but I thought my meal was top-notch. We started with the empanadas. It was like Mexican pierogies. Little deep-fried pastries filled with beef and mashed potatoes made cheating on my healthy eating feel so damn good. I got the Santa Fe fettuccine alfredo with chicken and couldn't stop myself from eating it. It included my two favorite green things to eat, broccoli and green chiles, along with chicken and a delicious sauce. God help me, it made me want to be a fat southwestern Italian so I could eat this everyday and not feel bad about it.  Will I return? You bet your bottom dollar for the food. I could care less about the bar/club scene they're trying to throw down. They should just stick to what they do best and that's make food and serve it to hungry girls like me.

We came here for a happy hour and I definitely left happy. I had sweet tea vodka and lemonade cocktails at $4 each.  A very nice price for the tall drink. We also tried the chicken wings and spinach dip.  Both tasty.  The wings were so good.  Lollipop style with the right amount of spice. The interior was open with high ceilings and an industrial feel.  The staff were all friendly.  I would like to go back and try some of their entrees.

Since the Zinburger was offering a 2 for $30 restaurant week menu and my BFF and I have been wanting to try this place for a while, we popped in for our BFF date night.  There was a wait for two; but since there were seats open at the bar, we opted to sit there. I was totally fine with that because my back was now toward the wall with the cow mural on it. I personally feel a little awkward eating a burger while a cow is staring at me. Even if it is a painting.  The service was initially slow at the bar, but it was really busy when we got there. After that, the bartenders were attentive and friendly.  The restaurant week menu was 2 glasses of wine, 2 burgers, and a side to share for $30. That's a good deal. We got the Zinburger and the Samburger and split both. We ordered both cooked medium; one came more medium rare and one more medium well. I like my burgers more medium well, so I was ok with that one, but had to think past the extra pinkness of the other burger. My only main complaint, but they were still very tasty. The onions on the Zinburger were super yummy. Our sweet potato fries were so good as well and appreciate getting those before our burgers to snack on while we waited for the main event. This was enough food to stuff us.  Next time I'll have to split one burger and fries so I'll have enough room for dessert. I'm a sucker for banana cream pie and that's on the menu. After the wine, I tried the vanilla lime sarsparilla cocktail.  The combination sounds a little strange, but it was super tasty.   Everything was super good and the restaurant is casual cool.  I will be a repeat visitor.

Lucky me, I came here with a group and we were provided with a sampling menu! We were provided a little bit of everything and now I will share with you my experience.  First plate had pita and hummus, sweet potato avocado salad, and mac n cheese. The pita was soft and delicious. I've had better hummus, but it was decent. The mac n cheese was good, but had too much bread crumbs for my taste. The sweet potato avocado salad was amazing. I couldn't stop myself from eating it.  The second plate was sweet potato fries, waffle fries, and tots. Absolutely crispy with a soft center and air fried. Crazy! I would describe the dipping sauce as sweet and sour plus spicy yum.  Third round was the kitchen sink salad and the spicy mango salad. I really really really liked the spicy mango salad. A mix of sweet and spicy flavors that really complemented each other. The kitchen sink salad was good, but not that memorable.  Next was a sampling of sandwiches: grilled cheese pork tenderloin, chicken salad, and Tuscan chicken. All three delicious. The pork tenderloin was chai rubbed and you could definitely taste those flavors. The bread on all three were soft and light.  We then were treated to eggplant Parmesan with pasta that was so yummy. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The Parmesan sauce was rich and not sweet.  We ended with lemon cheesecakes and chocolate tarts. The tart was rich and the lemon cheesecake was heavenly.  The drinks were tasty as well. I had the acai martini that went down smooth. The lemonade was fresh and had the right balance of sweet and tart. The tea had a hint of mint that was quite refreshing.  We ate so much and it was all delicious. It's not on the top of my list for a return dinner, but I look forward to another meal here.

Wow!  This place blows the other Vegas party pools away. They have three pools with round beds with umbrellas in the shallow area to reserve.  In and near the pools are islands with poles for girls, or guys I guess, to dance on that also spray a shower down.  There's a hot tub with a water wall.  The pools are surrounded by lounge chairs and beds that are available by reservation.  Along the west side of the Beach club are two stories of cabanas.  They are away from the crowds to get your privacy, but close enough to still be a part of the action.  I saw three bars and two sets of bathrooms to alleviate the normal ridiculous lines you get elsewhere.  They also have some blackjack and craps tables set up in the elevated bar area that's air conditioned but still open.  There was a sort of snack bar area you could walk up to and order salads, sandwiches, wraps, etc and not have to try to flag down a waitress.  The setup was well thought out and addresses the issues the other pools lack in. The service was outstanding!  I was blown away by how friendly and helpful the staff was.  The bartenders had no problem blending up frozen drinks (another bartender at another pool told us this weekend he couldn't do that for us since it was busy even though its on their menu).  When we walked in, every single employee told us welcome, or thank you for coming.  It felt really nice to know that they were appreciative of the obscene amount of money we were all about to spend there. What is even more awesome, they have Kaskade playing there every Sunday.  If you don't know who Kaskade is, he is an established house music producer and dj.  So expect to hear some dance music when you come here and not hip hop.  The opening dj played more of top 40 remixes.   They really make this an experience for guests and I can't wait to go back!!

I really like this place. There aren't that many lanes, so if you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday night, call ahead and reserve your lane.  This place has a lounge area with a good sized bar and couch area. Over where the 10 lanes are, there are about 4 pool tables, another bar, and another table and couches area. The end of the lanes have screens above them to watch sports or music videos. They play good music very loud. I had a really great time.  My only complaint, we reserved lanes for 4 hours, and when the 4 hours was up, they wanted us out immediately. They started bussing the tables just taking drinks away. I was busy changing my shoes and didn't notice the busboy grabbed my drink. Excuse me, I just purchased that. I let him know that I understood they wanted us gone, but should ask the person sitting there which drink is theirs before throwing it away. As we were leaving, I was at the other table in our area and the busboy asks me if any of the drinks on that table were mine. I reminded him that he threw mine away and he should probably be asking that question to somebody else. It really annoyed me.  I would definitely recommend it for a Sunday fun day. I didn't feel like we could really relax and have a good time on a Saturday because it was too busy and the staff was looking to make money rather than have their guests entertained.

We came here on a First Friday which worried me a little bit.  Trying to get good service at a location downtown on a First Friday is like trying to get an alligator to drop it's lunch in the middle of it's barrel roll.  (You like that simile?)  Well, we got great service.  Our server was so friendly and attentive and helpful.  It was a huge change from the first time I went to this restaurant when it was called something else. I had the Boston Tea Party cocktail: vodka, lemonade, and green tea I believe.  If that's wrong, that's what it tastes like.  It was great.  I love vodka.  For dinner, I had the loaded mac and cheese.  Judge me all you want, it was worth every gram of fat and carbohydrates.  It was filled with lots of chicken and lots of bacon and lots of cheese.  After this meal, I realized how amazing life is that my taste buds have the opportunity to indulge like this.

This place was great! Everything 475 calories or less?!?!?! That means I can have 4 things and still eat healthier than I would by getting a value meal at fast food. (I wouldn't though). There is a different special menu every week, hence the 52, to showcase foods that are in currently in season. I love this restaurant concept.  The decor is very dark, yet comfy. Reminds me a bit of a supper club without the large round booths. There's also a few private rooms which would come in handy for a lovely bridal shower, work meeting, birthday party, etc. I'm always on the look out for great restaurants with private rooms.  My coworkers and I had lunch here. They both had a cup of buffalo chili to start. I kind of wish I had too because it smelled awesome. They both said it was great. It's made with black beans rather than the usual kidney. I love black beans and hate kidney. It really looked like it was just meat in there. I'm glad I didn't get it though because then I'd be too full to work the rest of the day.  I ordered the chicken chile relleno with spinach, goat cheese, and corn cakes. Yum!!! I have no idea how this deliciousness is less than 475 calories!! Soooooo good and sooooo filling.  Not too spicy either for those who like food on the tame side.  My friend got the pork taco flat bread and said it was amazing. My other coworker got the mahi tuna salad and it looked awesome. He said it was great.  We were slightly tempted to try one of the mini desserts. The cocktail menu was tempting as well. I look forward to coming back here not during my workday to indulge.

One of the best iced lattes I've ever had!  I drank it so fast I thought about ordering another one.  It's a good thing I didn't order a second one because I would have never gone to sleep.  I love a caffeine-filled latte.  It's in an old downtown house and there are tables in the front yard.  It was nice to relax outside and enjoy the beautful day with a delicious drink.  There's so many great reviews about the crepes, I can't wait to go back and try them!

The Cosmo is amazingly beautiful.  This lounge is amazingly beautiful and comfy.  All the bars in the Cosmo are beautiful, but we had a great time here.  We scored the private room off just between the strip and the deejay.  The tourists walked by and stared at us getting our drink on and the dj helped me get my dance on.  You could make this bar be as chill or high energy as you'd like.  The drinks were just as cheap/expensive as any other place in Vegas.  I think I averaged $10 a cocktail.  Definitely a great spot to start or end or spend the night in.

I came here shortly after they opened for the Yelp preview. I didn't want to write a review on that for a few reasons; mainly because it wasn't a true dining experience. The food and the cocktails were so awesome that night and the staff was amazingly friendly... I don't know what took me so long to come back.  At the Yelp event, I love love love loved the lamb meatball (which seems to actually be the lamb burger on the menu) and the smart chicken. It was late night and I wasn't starving, so wanted to choose a smaller plate. I have a friend who once told me, "If a restaurant has crab cakes on the menu, order them. If the crab cakes are good, then you know it's a good restaurant." I saw crab cakes on the menu and thought of what he said. Now, I already knew this restaurant creates great food so didn't need to use the crab cakes as an indicator. I don't normally go for seafood items, but had crab cakes once that were delicious in DC and always wanted to taste crab cakes that good since then. I figured there was a good chance these crab cakes might give those DC cakes a fun for their money and I was so right. They were sooooooooo good. I'm still thinking about them and will be letting my crab cake loving friend know he's missing out if he doesn't ever get to eat these.  Oh yeah, do you know they have a sausage of the day? Citizen Public House is awesome.  Each month they have a cocktail pairing dinner that I keep meaning to get to. I love to drink and I love to eat. Smartest idea ever to pair foods with cocktails rather than cocktails to food. So far they've only been on nights where I have to work the next day; which explains why I haven't been to one yet. I'm just going to have to give in and use a vacation day for the following day for an upcoming dinner.  The only thing they need to do in order to completely have my heart is serve weekend brunch. Once they do that, they will become my steady restaurant boyfriend.

Another fantastic place in the Coronado.  The ambiance is great and what you expect from a converted home built 100 years ago.  We sat at the bar and got great service.  I saw what looked to be an awesome patio for when it cools off in a few months.   We went during happy hour when the prices were low and the food was delicious.  I ordered the Spicy Asian spring roll and didn't really think it was that spicy based on what the ingredients were.  It was very delicious and I added red chili sauce to it so I could get the face burn I was hoping for.  My friend ordered the hot wings and those must have been hot.  He was sweating bullets.  I also ordered the Crispy Pork spring roll to share with my friend and didn't want to share.  Take a leaf off the mint and place it on the spring roll and dip it into the sauce and place it in your mouth in order to experience flavor heaven.   They also have my favorite vodka here.  Vodka is a great reason to go anywhere.

I visited here a few months ago and totally forgot about writing a review.  In fact, I almost forgot about getting a massage here.  It really didn't impress me at all. First of all, the room was bright, which makes it hard to relax.  Secondly, the therapist started asking me questions about my personal life.  I don't like to talk other than to say that I'd like the pressure to change or that they are hurting me.  I'm not there to chat and make friends.  I'm there to relax.  Third of all, after I told her what I do for a living, she decided to insult my choice of doing what I do for a living for quite a long period of time.  It really sucks to lie naked on a table while someone judges you.  For reals.  Lastly, the massage was boring.  It was obvious she was just going through the motions and didn't really care.  Maybe she lost interest after she found out I work for a company she doesn't like. Although the price was nice, I'd rather spend more and go to a location with therapists that care about providing what their client is paying for.

So I haven't gone back, but I must give an update.  I have written reviews for places I did not have a good experience at and the owners and managers have contacted me trying to justify my bad experience.  I should come back because "they were having a bad day," "their location is similar to the other options nearby," or "maybe I don't know what good taste is," etc.   After writing my non-glowing review, I was contacted by the owner of this salon, Kristen.  I expected to get the same kind of response as we all have before, but I didn't.   Before I could get the chance to email her back, she found my phone number in her database and called me asking me to let me know the specifics so that she could be aware of any way she can improve her business.  It's refreshing to know this website is used by business owners in a constructive way. After explaining the specifics, she apologized, promised to work with her employees on improving their customer service skills and invited me back to try a massage with another therapist and try a facial as well.   I applaud Kristen for emabracing growth, feedback, and education about her business.  I work with small businesses everyday and know that many are opposed to change and will shut their ears to any type of negative feedback.  Based on the interactions I've had with Kristen, I'm certain that this spa will be constantly improving and will be a location worth visiting long into the future.  I recommend everyone try this day spa solely on the fact that it is being run by a very exceptional individual.

Everybody that has reviewed Windsor has taken all my words.  I guess that's what I get for waiting so long to visit this gem. So here's my two cents:   Penny 1:  The weather has cooled off at night, so sit on the patio and enjoy the awesomeness while drinking cocktail No 01.  That's Zero One. Penny 2:  Eat the macaroni and cheese.  We had the burger with it and they were both fantastic.. We made new friends at the bar and the staff was uber-friendly. I'm happy we turned left rather than right on Central.

I came back for my birthday.  In order to celebrate in true Maribeth fashion, we ordered pretty much everything on the menu.  I'm not exaggerating here.  Everything was good.  EVERYTHING.  You seriously cannot go wrong with anything on the menu and I am a picky eater.  They were accomodating to our party of 12 and on top of bringing drinks and food in a timely manner and they were packed that night.  The staff was always friendly and never looked a bit stressed or flustered, which you sometimes get at busy restaurants.  This place is top-notch!!  The first time I was there, I provided my email address to get updates and they sent me an email on my birthday that I could get any dessert for free next door at Churn.  So awesome!

There's a certain amazingness that comes from fresh made ice cream.  It's soft, creamy, and not filled with high fructose corn syrup and preservatives to keep it together for months in a freezer.  Growing up in Arizona, we always made homemade ice cream in the summer and if you've never experienced homemade ice cream, just go to Churn. I had the banana ice cream with caramel sauce on top.  I can't say anything bad about it at all.  If someone doesn't like their ice cream, it's because they've been subject to all the fakeness added to ice cream in the stores and national ice cream shop chains.   The shop has lots of toys and candy and knickknacks that will give you a sense of nostalgia.  I'll tell you what sounds like the best day ever:  riding my bike down Central on a beautiful Phoenix day... stopping in to Churn for an ice cream break (and then popping into one of the restaurants nearby for a cocktail).

This is definitely one of my favorite places downtown.   We love live music!  In fact, musicians play on a stage above the main bar and behind the beer taps.  Sweet set up.  There is no set dance floor so expect myself and others to be dancing around your table.  Some nights there are some really great bands playing and others have the bands that play the Vegas style top 40 mash ups that I find a little strange. The staff are super friendly and know how to mix a drink.  I can always count on Willis to serve my vodkas up right.  Not too stiff, not too weak.  A great bartender that always adds to our fun time. The location is fantastic.  The sister to Stand Up live, across from Lucky Strike, on the second floor of CityScape, so the view on the patio of downtown at night is a winner. I haven't ate here yet, but if the food is the same as they serve at Stand Up Live, it's pretty tasty bar fair. It's a great choice if you're looking for a fun time downtown.  (You don't need to be a hipster to fit in either)

When there's like a 100 different topping choices, pay per ounce isn't always the best thing.  Mmmmmmm it's so good though.  Worth every cent!   Every employee I've encountered has been friendly.  The place is really large with a lot of tables.  My only recommendation is to set up a few tables outside.  On a lovely Phoenix evening, enjoying froyo outside would be heavenly. Yummmmmmmm.... I'm going to have to go there tomorrow.

I've been a big fan of Tomaso's since I was a teenager so was happy to try Tommy V's.  The Italian food here tastes authentic and delicious.  They have a large wine list.  I feel the only difference between Tommy V's and Tomaso's really is the decor.  Tomaso's has that old school Italian restaurant vibe.  Tommy V's has a modern contemporary interior with a few pictures of girls on the walls where all you can focus on are their boobs.  It was kinda funny that all three of us at dinner noticed it. I had the eggplant torta and butternut squash ravioli.  The eggplant torta tasted to me like eggplant parmesan but in a lasagna type shape.  The butternut squash ravioli was divine.  I would love if I could just have a giant bowl of that! We made reservations, but being that it was a Thursday night in the summer, they weren't really necessary.   Their prices pretty much start at $15 and go up.  I noticed they have a decent happy hour menu if you are a bargain eater.   This would be a fantastic date spot, but sit inside.  The patio would probably be nice during the day with friends, but there's nothing romantic about sharing a bottle of wine in front of the Grapevine and a parking lot. Great Italian and great atmosphere!

I've done the spray tans in the teleportation device before, but have never been airbrushed.  Considering a spray tan in the tube is normally between $20 and $25, I was happy to purchase the Living Social deal at Phoenix Glow for a $12 session.   I was a little nervous going in.  I am a little shy when it comes to changing clothes in front of my friends let alone standing in front of a stranger naked while they spray me down.  Typing that sentence even gave me a little anxiety.  I had this strange idea that it was going to be some stuck up girl that would judge me for how I look naked.  Not at all.  Rosa was very sweet and I didn't feel too awkward with her.  The whole process took about 15 minutes.  I opted for a mix of medium and dark and chose the long lasting add on.  My faux-tan looked great.  I looked about as dark as I can normally get and it didn't look orange or fake at all.  There were a few areas where my skin was really dry where the color didn't set right.  Those were very small areas and that has nothing to do with the quality of work.  My tan lasted over a week and I didn't look pasty white while I was on the beach in cloudy Mexico (YAY!). The regular prices seem reasonable to me considering how great of a tan I got and how much the sub-par spray tans are.  There was a Yelp offer while I was writing this as well; so there's plenty of opportunities for deals here. I definitely plan to go back and recommend for anyone who wants a tan but not skin cancer.  The first person I thought about was my friend who is getting married.  Could you imagine getting a spray tan before your wedding and being orange?  You definitely wouldn't have to worry about that if you got your tan here.

I remember when I was in high school and we'd go see live music at small venues like the Mason Jar and Electric Ballroom.  It was great to be intimate with my favorite musicians.  Those venues are long gone and I've seen many shows since then at large venues or small venues that just didn't have it right... Those small venues being bars or clubs that moved some tables or have a stage but a terrible sound system.  The Crescent Ballroom is everything I want from a small music venue. There is sufficient patio seating for the smokers to have their breaks.  There is also a large main bar area with seating for those dining.  This area is awesome and always open to everyone who just want to hang out downtown where delicious vodka and tasty nachos are served.   You can then enter the large space where the concerts are held.  There is plenty of standing room and plenty of stair seating (think high school gym bleachers).  There is a large bar in that area so you don't have to leave the music to get a drink.  I recommend finding a spot in the standing area in the middle.  Find those speakers and stand below them.  They have an amazing sound system where you hear and feel the music.   I hear they always have some musician playing either in the small or large area of the property.  It's great to have live music as an option every day of the week.

I had such a great time here!  I see many hard-earned dollars going here in my near and distant future. Go online to their website and pick out the painting you want to learn to paint.  Reserve your spot for that day.  Then the fun happens.  You get a glass of wine or beer with your admission price, a large canvas, paint, brushes and a smock to borrow.   The Brush Bar has the friendliest staff to show you how to create the painting of the night.  You can go off on an artistic tangent if you'd like as well.  We painted "Lover's Lane" but someone in the class painted a lighthouse.  There are no rules on your slightly buzzed artistic expression here.   We did this as a girls night out, but also think it would be a great date idea or family outing.  They also do a Sunday mimosa class.  Hells yeah! I can't draw a stick person to save my life.  My painting isn't about to hang on a wall at the Smithsonian, but it actually looks decent.  I love being creative and this was such a fun and relaxed way to get in touch with my artistic side for a few hours.

Recently I found out I'm allergic to eggs.  I thought my sweets-loving life was over... That is until my friend brought me to Nami just around the corner from my home. They have so many baked goods that are completely vegan - that means no eggs!  They are good too.  I've attempted to make eggless goodies and most of them do not come out well.  Nami has many selections such as snickerdoodles and chocolate chip cookies.  Most recently, I had a tsoynami with cookie dough and other chocolately goodness in it.  It was one of the best desserts ever!   I'm happy to know I can cruise over on my bike the next time I have a sweet tooth rather than having to make something myself.

I want to like it.  I really do.  They have an amazing back patio and carry Tito's vodka (which is super delicious if you haven't tried it).  But every time I've gone, something has disappointed me.   First off, service is nothing to write home about.  The first time we were here, we grabbed a table in the bar and were told we'd have to check in with the hostess for that table.  We checked in with her and were told it would be about 15-20 minutes.  We headed to the bar to grab a drink while we waited.  After we got our drinks, the hostess found us and said our table was ready.  Guess what table it was.  That was a big WTH.  Our server had to be flagged down by us when we wanted to order another drink or food.  He was ok with visiting all of his other tables around us though.  The next 2 times I've been here, the service was better, but terribly slow. Next up is the beer.  It is tasty.  I don't drink beer, but my friends let me try the ones they ordered.  I know that beer is best cold.  I imagine how much more these tasty beers would be if they were weren't warm.  It is a nanoBrewery for goodness sake.  Keep your main product cold! Finally, the food.  I'm just going to talk about one instance.  Brunch.  We ordered a breakfast flatbread that called for an over-medium egg to be on top.  The egg was completely cooked.  The yolk was solid which I find disgusting in a fried egg.  The point of an over-medium egg being on top of a pizza is so the runny yolk gets all over it.  And it's amazing when done right.  If the yolk isn't going to be runny, then scramble the darn things so it can be easily spread across the pizza.  The cost of the flatbread did include choice of beer or mimosa, so that helped the cause. Will I return here?  I'm sure my friends will want to have drinks on the patio and I will go with them.  Will I ever suggest to go here?  No way.

From those who brought you Spanish Fly, here's the improved Spanish Fly in north Scottsdale.  They did a great job remodeling the old Jilly's and turning it into a beautiful place to drink.  The inside is very large with televisions, a dance floor, and multiple bars.  The outside boasts a large pool with waterfall, multiple bars, plenty of loungers and cabanas, and a pool table.  If you're a fan of people watching, come here on the weekend.  You'll find wasted 20 somethings sunbathing in teeny bikinis and 50 somethings swimming laps to show they still have vitality. We came here on opening day to have weak drinks, our food order wrong, and a wait of 30 minutes for our tab after we asked for it.  It was opening day, everyone was friendly, and the place is so aesthetically pleasing that we chose to give it another try a few weeks later.  It had very much improved and I had a great time.  The drinks were not weak this time.  The food was delicious and came out as ordered.  The only suggestion I have is to install another light in the ladies' room.  It is pitch black in the first stall and you have to use the light on your cell phone to find the seat.  I hope this place is able to last while so many others fail.  It's a really cool place.

Breakfast!!! - from the awesome people that brought you The Tuck Shop.  Ok so they serve lunch and dinner as well, but breakfast is the most important meal of the day!   Get there early and grab a table, inside or out.  Pick out what you want and go to the counter and order.  They'll bring it to you when it's ready. I like this style of restaurant, especially when I'm eating out with my dad (he thinks eating out means flirt with the servers).   If you're boozing, it may be kind of annoying to keep going up and ordering and paying for each cocktail if you're using plastic.   Back to breakfast.... In true MB style, we decided to order half the menu, to be sure we're fairly judging the food.  You can't order one dish and tell people it's good or bad.  You truly have to order 5.  Ok so my dad ordered the biscuits and grillades and I ordered the fritatta.  We also got a side of the pastelito carne, patatas con queso, and cinnamon popovers.  All so delicious.   My fritatta was savory yummmy but I liked my dad's biscuits better.  Comforting biscuits with beef gravy, ahhhhhh.  Almost like grandma made.  Patatas con queso are bomb steak fries with cheese sauce.  The pastelito carne are somewhat sweet, flaky pastries with ground beef in them.  The cinnamon popovers were an amazing breakfast dessert mmmmmmmmm dipped in whiskey caramel sauce.  If I wake up on the wrong side of bed, I foresee myself riding over to Astor House for a breakfast cocktail and cinnamon popovers.  For reals. So after our 5 entrees, my dad's screwdriver (made with Tito's vodka yeah!), and my extra fantastic without sugar or cream iced coffee, my tab was about $35.  "Heck yes!" my wallet screamed.  My dad said later on, "They have really nice people at that restaurant by your house.  They really know how to cook too."  Dad's a believer, I am too.  I can't wait until it cools off to enjoy the beautiful patios.

If you've read my reviews of Tuck Shop or Astor House, you knew I would be at Vovomeena within a week of them opening.  My dad and I made breakfast plans and he requested Astor House.  I let him know they opened a new place right by Easley's we had to try instead.  He happily obliged. Vovomeena is a saving grace for an awesome brick center that was face-lifted to house small chain eateries.  I shouldn't be so hard; I love Zoyo too.  Just like Astor House (and the other eateries there), Vovomeena is order at the counter and a staff member will bring you your food.  I recommend finding an open table before ordering and claiming it with sunglasses or a book.  We were there the weekend after it opened and open tables were sparse.  I'm sure by the time I finally got around to writing my review (two months later) that it must be much busier and tables even more sparse. I woke up that day craving biscuits and gravy; so I naturally ordered the biscuits and grillades.  See my Astor House review if you want to know more about this tasty dish.  (It's just as awesome in the aves).  At a little nudging from me, my dad ordered the BMOC - Big Man On Campus.  Heck yes!  A deliciously rich waffle topped with the best pork chop I have ever had, over medium eggs, syrup, and a Portuguese donut for good measure.  I knew the waffle would be bomb because I've had the waffles at Tuck Shop (you can read about those too in my Tuck Shop review).  This pork chop was heavenly.  I'm telling you that I'm seriously planning to make pork loin with maple syrup in homage to this pork chop at Christmas.  Cut it with a fork smoked tender meat... oh my goodness!  I don't know that I could ever finish a BMOC on my own, but was happy to eat some of my dad's.  The donut was a perfect dessert my dad and I shared at the end.  Light and fluffy with a taste reminiscent of funnel cake.   Vovomeena has that amazing cold brewed coffee chocked full of the caffeine I love.  Fantastically attentive and friendly staff - probably from all that cold brewed coffee. The space is that modern, industrial chic that we all love.  There's a buffet table near one of the entrances we thought was the hostess stand before we determined it was also counter order and seat yourself - my only complaint.  Though it is not really a complaint.   I can't wait to go back and try more.  I'm disappointed in myself that I was so hell bent on having grillades that day, I didn't get to try two brand new dishes.  Luckily, it's just down the street.

I'm a pretty big fan of coffee. Real talk: I love coffee. I also work remotely, so am always looking for a good place to get work done and get my coffee fix.  Smooth Brew fits my needs! When I moved down the street 3 years ago, i kept hoping a drive thru coffee joint would open nearby so I could hit it up quickly on my way to work. Finally my wishes were answered. The plus is the inside holds cozy chairs, couches, and many tables where I can work (because I'm not going to get my work done from home as much as I try to tell myself I will).  Oh, and there's free wifi for when we leave our jet packs in our other bag.  Let me get back to what you came to read about, the coffee. I've been trying to work my way down the menu. I'm a big fan of iced coffee - and I add coconut milk and no sweeteners - perfect! My favorite drink (when I'm not worrying about calories) is the iced tres leches. So smooth and delicious. If you like sweet, the red velvet is your drink. I enjoyed the salted caramel truffle and think that will be my warm go to drink this winter. I had an iced panda which tasted exactly how I like my iced coffee (which is weird since I generally don't add chocolate to my coffee). On a super hot day, the coffee chiller was a perfect treat. Yummmmm.  I also like to eat... sometimes healthy. Smooth Brew has smoothies! I've only had the green monster, since I'm a big fan of drinking my vegetables and this one is made with superfood kale (but I can't taste it - I just taste deliciousness). I've also tried the high maintenance bowl - quinoa, black beans, sweet potatoes and some other yummy stuff. They even have sriracha sauce. This is so perfect for me since I'm allergic to eggs and generally can not have most of the pastries or snacks at other coffee shops. My coworker had the turkey breakfast sandwich one morning and said it was so good.  Everyone that works here is friendly and pleasant and knew my name by the 3rd time I came in. I'm so happy this is nearby. I'm just afraid it'll get too popular and I won't find a place to sit and work when I'm not using the drive thru.
