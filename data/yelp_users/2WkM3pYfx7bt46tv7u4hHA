This place was awesome!  The prices are so reasonable we had a hard time spending all $22 of our voucher!  I had the Cinnamon Toast Crunch dring (there is also a shot) and the Liquid Marijuana.  Both were good, but 'tis the season for cinnamon and that one really hit the spot.  The Bartender was on point handling everyone who came in, with ease.  We sat at the bar and never had to worry about asking for a fresh drink.  Excellent.  We ordered the Sampler Platter Appetizer with 5 items ($9.50) it was out quickly with a huge cup of ranch.  It could have fed 5 people!  You order food here directly from the kitchen, and the cook was very nice, too.  Later the owner (?) arrived and he went about talking to all of the guests.    We will be back!

Great service, very friendly.  Call for an appointment first, this not a lube and tune, this is an auto repair shop.  The quality and professionalism are indicative of that.

This is a nice place to wait for your car.  It is temperature controlled and has a fresh-ground coffee machine.  Everyone is really friendly and the work is excellent.  There is a small waiting room with a TV and a larger space in the main showroom/office.  You can look at all sorts of tires and tire related things while you hang out.  I suggest getting an appointment for your oil changes as this is a full service auto shop.  It is a courtesy to those who will be working on your vehicle and it also allows you to plan your day.  :)

We just ordered form here and were totally disappointed when our food arrived.  I could not believe that the teryaki chicken came with no rice, for $6.95!  The wontons were burned and tasted horrible and the sushi was very weak compared to other places in the area, I literally get better sushi from Fry's.  We will not be ordering from here again.  Worst part was it was delivery, so we didn't make alternate dinner arrangements.

Very friendly, great old fashioned feel.  NO appointment, short wait.  Carl knows his stuff.  There were 3 people ahead of us, and we were still seen within an hour!  Definitely going to go back!

Wonderful atmosphere!  I have been passing this little diner for years on my way to work, and was finally able to stop for those famous "Biscuits and Gravy" touted on the sign.  I was so pleased!  The food tastes like love and pride.  The staff is friendly and warm, and the food is served hot and well-prepared.  Went back a week later and had a reuben, just as delicious!  I am thinking of going again today!

This is one family business that remains true to old fashioned values.    The owner's son is the face that greets you at the door and the mechanic has been with the company for almost 10 years.  These guys are dedicated to earning and keeping your trust all while providing top-notch friendly service.  It's nice to find a business I trust.  Auto and truck repair, classic cars, imports, and propane.

I just had the nicest time here.  I had a Groupon for 2 glasses of wine and a cheese plate, I went with my BFF and we added a Lobster Benedict to our order.  Our waitress was friendly and funny, I felt like I knew her from somewhere.  Our wine was served first, a generous and well presented serving in a decanter.  followed shortly by our cheese plate.  The brie, when put onto the toast (she sai it was just some oil and herbs) was inexplicably delicious, it was like angels toasted and buttered it themselves, sniff.

I have been visiting this Lenny's since it opened and I was lured in by the smell of hamburgers as I biked home from work one day.  I been there with about everyone who will go.  I have had their burger on many occasions, but our stand by (my son, daughter and I after school) is cheese, or chili cheese fries and root beer floats.  The last visit was so wonderful I just have to Yelp about it!  I got my burger and it was perfect, our fries were perfectly hot and crisp (as always) , the side of cheese was warm and generous, our food arrived quickly and the service was friendly and attentive all around.  I will definitely continue to vote with my dollars for Lenny's to stay in my neighborhood!

Glad we read earlier reviews with hints about the location being in a mall.  That was helpful.  It is really quite cool inside, you feel a little like you are behind the scenes, where the magic happens.  This is because--you are!  You can look to the back of the building and see where the beer is made, all beautiful clean and working!    We sat at the bar and were given out tasting flights of awesome beers.  And even purchased a few more after the tour.  The staff is very knowledgeable and happy to share what they have learned over the years.    We plan on coming back in the near future and bringing many friends.  Thank you!

This troupe is obviously having a great time as they perform off-color-with-a-heart (sometimes) comedy.  Nothing is sacred as the Holidays get a swift poke in the ribs and a pinch on the cheek.  Funniest Holiday show around, please don't bring the children or a stick up your bum, or you'll be sorry.  A perfect cocktail with a valium to soothe the nerves before we face the Holiday joy just around the corner.

Just got back from a meal at this restaurant*. The staff, from the Host to the waitstaff (who all helped each other out to make sure customers were taken care of in a timely manner), was on point, and our server, Stephanie, anticipated our every need. I got the lamb chops with horseradish potatoes and the meal was phenomenal! I am looking forward to returning soon!   *We went at about 3:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday.  It was busy, but not yet crazy busy.  It was starting to fill up when we were leaving about an hour later.

We used GrubHub.com to place our order and it was so easy.  The food arrived in under the time promised and our delivery driver was very friendly.  All of our special requests were fulfilled and the portions were generous!  Very delicious!  I had the lettuce wraps and my husband and son ate teriyaki chicken, one with fried rice and one with white.  We also ordered a side of crab puffs.  We were provided with ample sauces and fortune cookies, too.  Plenty left over for dinner!  We will definitely be ordering again!

I am hoping this was just an uncharacteristically bad night, because my experience does not align with the raves about the food and service.  I am only writing a review because I was urged to by our delivery driver.  The facts: I requested in the GrubHub "Special Instructions" section to use the side door and bring Parmesan and red pepper flakes (I have a photo of my confirmation screen). It took over an hour for the pizza and wings to arrive. The driver went to the front door and had no cheese or pepper.  He then told me he didn't get the instructions, and he was late because he had just "...argued with a lady for ten minutes about what kind of sauce she got..."  I asked if our food was still hot.  He replied that it was "plenty hot", it was not.  I asked if he had any condiments in his car .  He said he was "not allowed" to carry any cheese or pepper.  (That is when I told him I would Yelp about that and he said "You should!") I put the pizza in the oven to reheat it and it was so under-cooked the dough seeped through the grate and fell in globs.  I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager who agreed to refund my money through GrubHub (as it is the weekend, I won't know if this happened for a few days).  As of now, I am satisfied with how he handled it.  I ate one piece of pizza due to my extreme hunger, the sausage tastes like hamburger to me and the toppings were very unevenly scattered.  I woke up in the middle of the night sick to my stomach.  I can't say it was the pizza that did it, but it was the last thing I ate yesterday.    I really wanted to like this place, my family loves neighborhood restaurants and especially ones with pizza and wings and delivery, but I don't think I will risk ordering from this place again, even if this was just an off night.  :(  My money was successfully refunded.  I am grateful management is professional.

We weren't sure what to get when we arrived.  We just knew we wanted to try it!   I asked for suggestions and we ended up getting the cheese dinner special, there was a lot of food!  We got cheddar with chicken, broccoli, cauliflower, pretzel and foccacia.  We also got a milk chocolate dip with rice krispie treats, nilla wafers and oreos.  Everything was amazing!  Seeing the "A" rating in the window is always a bonus, too!  The place was clean, inviting, and comfortable.  Everything was prepared for us and brought to our table nice and hot (if it was supposed to be).  A very enjoyable experience.  We will be back. :)

Truly disappointed.  We went twice, the first time was so good we brought friends to try it and support this local business.  Unfortunately, the service was so bad the second time that even the good sushi could not make us feel better.  The worst part was they added 18% gratuity to our bills! (We asked for one bill, but were given 7.)  We were literally forced to tip very high for subpar service.  I think this is an outrageous practice. My husband and his associates were late returning to work since it took over 15 minutes for their food order to be taken, the waiter kept vanishing and had to be hunted down whenever we needed something.  No plates were bussed, no sodas we refilled, and our order was incorrect.  The manager did not make us pay for the food we didn't order, but even though we complained about the service, added the tip to all of our bills....the sushi is really good, but based on this visit, I won't be back, or recommend to anyone that they dine in.  Take out, sure!  I almost didn't post this review, but I felt so sucker punched by the addition of the tip, that I thought others should be warned.  They took off the 20% coupon and added an 18% tip for 10% service!

There was a sign on the front door asking that you mention your Groupon before ordering so we did.  The gentleman immediately marked it redeemed and left us with menus.  After 6 minutes he came to take our order, we were not yet ready and I asked for water.  He seemed irritated, but left again and then disappeared in back for 5 minutes, the place was empty and my friend and I felt very uncomfortable and unwelcome.  We decided that we did not want to be there any longer, nor eat anything there.  It was a very unsettling atmosphere, which is unfortunate because it is beautiful inside and the menu looked lovely.  We exited and went down the road to Green Corner which is consistently good and welcoming.  We really felt that our business was not appreciated because we had a Groupon which is unfortunate, because having spent decades in the service industry, we use all the money we save to leave amazing tips for our servers .  So very disappointed. :(
