On 5/25/13 I purchased an HBO series on DVD from Best Buy Phoenix Store #177 (Ahwatukee). I later realized that I already owned that particular season and today (6/18/13) I went back to that same store to return the DVDs. I was told that I was not within the return limit policy and would not be able to return the DVDs (I was not even given the option of receiving store credit). Like most consumers I thought the return window was 30 days, which I am currently still within. The "customer service" associate told me that if I was a Best Buy Reward Zone Premier Silver member I would have had 60 days to return my items. Ohhh, ok, if I sign up for your rewards program then I get the benefits that most major retailers offer every customer, rewards member or not. The Best Buy associate told me this new policy took affect in March...well why not tell your customers that when they go through the checkout line? Forever 21 tells their customers that all accessories are final sale and clothing items can only be exchanged, not returned. Would it really be that difficult to tell people that their return policy has changed? Throw it in there while you're trying to sell me your Best Buy credit card.  Yes, the 15 day return policy was printed in fine letters on my receipt and yes I should have paid better attention to this. However, I still feel slighted by Best Buy and because of that I will not be giving my business or hard earned money to any Best Buy store from this point forward and I will make sure that everyone I know is aware of their 15 day return policy before they shop there.

Edit: Two plus years and four more suits later and I can firmly say Barry is the absolute best. He's always happy to see us and ALWAYS makes sure we find what we're looking for. Whether it's another suit for a wedding or a suit for my little brother's first prom, we're always taken care of and leave with an amazing suit. My boyfriend recently proposed and I can't wait to have Barry help us find my fianc√© the perfect outfit for our wedding day!   My boyfriend and I went to Barry with quite the predicament on Saturday around noon. We needed a suit for a wedding THAT NIGHT. Barry took one look at my boyfriend and knew what size he was. He immediately started pulling suits, showing us different styles, colors and fit options. He was very friendly and knew his stuff. It was clear he has been doing this for many years. We ended up selecting two suits (one for that night and one for a future wedding) and both were on sale for $99. We've never seen desginer suits at such a low price point and the customer service Barry gives you can't be beat.   Barry's normal tailor was not in the store this day so he directed us to someone else who could do the alterations while we waited. The suit turned out perfect and my boyfriend was complimented on it all night. We will definitely be back to see Barry for all our future men's suit needs.

I found Giovanni's through a quick Google search and I am so glad I did! Giovanni upholstered a headboard for my boyfriend and I and we absolutely could not be happier with the finished product. His prices were reasonable and he was always quick to return an email or phone call. A year ago we had another headboard upholstered by a different company and were less than thrilled with their lack of professionalism and the quality of the product. Giovanni blew the other company out of the water. I was so happy when the headboard was delivered that I cried. (Overly emotional Interior Design student? Perhaps.) My only regret was that I didn't find Giovanni a year earlier so he could do our other headboard.

I have been going to Epic Salon for a few years now and have always been pleased with their customer service. All of the girls are so sweet and always willing to make you feel like you're really being pampered.   Breanne Nock is my stylist and she's been doing my hair for 9 years. I followed her from her previous salon to Epic. I have severe  emotional attachment to my hair and would never trust anyone except Breanne to cut or color my hair. She is literally THE. BEST. and I always feel like a million bucks when she's done and would highly recommend anyone who's in need of a stylist to make an appointment with Breanne.

There's a reason Janine has all 5 star reviews. She's friendly, accommodating, has great prices and provides top quality work. Janine has been our go-to person for all of my fiance's alterations on his suits for 3 years. Each time we see her we're reminded of why we drive from Chandler to Phoenix for her services...we wouldn't go to anyone else and neither should you!
