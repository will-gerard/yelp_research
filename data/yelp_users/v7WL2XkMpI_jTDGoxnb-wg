This place is in such a weird locations but we've been going here since I was young. Their French toast with strawberries and whip is so delicious and huge! But probably my very favorite thing is the blackberry bread pudding. It's insane and has ruined bread pudding anywhere else for me! I get it for breakfast all the time. Haha! Mmm now I want that. The 4 star is because the decor is just so so terrible. Like I often don't recommend this place to people asking for breakfast/brunch Recs because the atmosphere is so ugly. Wish they'd get a makeover!

me and my sis just got our nails done at Elite Nails and both had an amazing experience. They went above and beyond to pamper us and the prices were very fair! I got a gel polish change but she still have me a little massage and hot towel and she took great care to make sure I was happy with it. My sister got a basic pedi and she said it was the best of her life. He was gentle and didn't tickle her feet like most people have. She said the spa chair massage felt so good. Just thought I'd share since I've been looking for a good place! Will definitely be going back.

I can't even handle how much I love this place! It's hands down my favorite pizza joint around. We always get the avocado pizza and we add corn then sprinkle a little bit of the sea salt they have on the tables over the avocados. Oh my goodness. You just can't top that with their sour dough crust . I just can't even. Dang it, I want that now! They also have delish fries and chicken wings, but let's be real, the pizza is what it's all about.

The lemon grass chicken is the most insanely flavorful, most delicious dish I've ever had in my life. It's like fireworks of salty, spicy, sweet, umami miracles are exploring in your mouth...99% of the time I'm the happiest I've ever been when I eat it. Occasionally the pieces of chicken are too big and it doesn't have that amazing crunch that I love, but luckily even when the texture is a little off, the flavor is still there. My husband gets the BBQ pork and loves it. He's also likes the yellow curry, not the best we've ever had, but still very nice. He got the Pad Thai and I wanted to gag it was so sweet, but maybe that's what it's supposed to be like, I'd never had it before. The staff is super nice. Just make sure to order the freaking lemongrass chicken, mmkay? Oh, and I get "no spice" and it still has a definite kick. My husband who likes spicy can only handle "low spice". They aren't messing around here.

I just so don't get the hype around this place. The only thing I even sort of like is the crazy potato but the last two times I've been I've even been disappointed in that. The only reason I've been a few times is because my husband used to like it alright and it's close to our house but last time was the last time we'll be going. We both we just disappointed one too many times. The two stars is just because they did such a good job designing the place and they have glass bottle sodas that are of course delish. I'm glad they're having success, but it's not our cup of tea.

We just love this place so much. Love having a delicious and cool spot to go here in Mesa! The owner is rad and loves his patrons, he's passionate about Mesa and good food. Lunch time is a great time to go and get the special. Lots of food for a great price. The worst part about RE is having to choose what to get! My absolute favorite thing is the bean and cheese Empanada and their yuca frita dipped in their jalapeño ranch (you have to ask for it). If you're with a group, get the caribe platter as an appetizer. My husband is obsessed with the pork torta smothered in their green salsa and the jalapeño ranch. The fries it comes with are YUM and I'm always stealing some. We also love the potato Empanada and the Nutella dessert Empanada. If you're interested in a salad the black bean one is my fave. You guys, GO, support Mesa and make your belly happy. Then go for a stroll in the urban garden next door :)

Nice chewy soft cookies and THRIFY ICECREAM! Yum! We love the price too and it's great having something that stays open late on Main Street! We will definitely be coming here for date night a lot! You can tell they tried to make the decor cute, it's not bad, but sort of half way. Hopefully as it succeeds they will make improvements so it will be a really cute place to hang out!

Meh, food was edible. Service was fine, but not great considering there seemed to be a ton of employees and we were there at 3 in the afternoon. I thought it was very overpriced. You have to buy everything individually. We got one fried fish taco (just tasted like greasy batter hardly any fish), one grilled fish (least favorite), two grilled shrimp, one of the "house favorite" pork, rice and beans. We both thought the grilled shrimp was best, but it was so tiny-- one medium sized shrimp per taco. The black bean side was $3 and a very small portion. The rice had a nice flavor but the texture of rice reminded me of the cheap rice you get at a hospital cafeteria :/ We had finished half our meal when they eventually brought the chips and salsa. The decor looked cool from the outside because the bar is cute but inside seemed dated already. And the music selection was obnoxious. I know there are lots of other things on the menu that are probably good but it will be hard to get me to come back because our first try was so lackluster and the prices are just too high for what we got. Too bad, I was excited for this.
