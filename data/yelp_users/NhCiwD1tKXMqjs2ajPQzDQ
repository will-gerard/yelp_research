I am not ashamed to admit that I am a lazyass when it comes to my hair.  I am that girl who doesn't set out to grow out her hair to donate to Locks of Love, its just that my haircuts are so few and far between that I always just happen to have the required 9 inches of hair to cut (and have donated 4 times now).     Suffice it to say that it had been a while since my hair had seen a pair of scissors and I was well over due - even for me.  I had passed by Par Exsalonce many times while in the area and thought to myself that I may as well give it a shot and I promptly booked an appointment with Staci - who the front desk girl assured me was great with very long, thick hair such as my mop.  The front desk staff was very friendly and attentive and I only had to wait a few minutes before Staci came to the front to meet me.  I have to admit that I was a bit nervous - many stylists in the past have salivated like hungry dogs at the sight of my long, virgin hair; I could almost see the visions of crazy hairdo's dancing in their heads.  Not Staci.  She really put me at ease and assured me that there would be no head shaving and unnatural hair color involved.    Less than an hour later, I emerged from the salon with my hair 6 inches shorter and styled in easy to maintain layers.  The price of $55 was very reasonable and I was prepared to pay far more than that.  I love my new haircut so much that I just may have to *gasp* maintain regular appointments with Staci.

Clearly I have been living under a rock for the 2 years that we have lived just 6a few miles from this gem because we never even knew it existed!  The husb and I are big breakfast people and back in ATL, we had TONS of breakfast joint options.  Here in North Scottsdale - not so much.   The husb and our friend Matt are training for a triathalon and decided that after their bike ride, they were going to run down through Cave Creek at which point myself and Matt's wife would meet them for some breakfast at Oaks.  We were seated immediately and glasses of ice water were instantly brought - good thing because the guys were dying of thirst.  They also had Vitamin Water which made the husb happy.  The menu had tons of options for typical diner fare.  I ordered scrambled egg whites and pancakes (my weakness).  Husb asked for eggs and a grilled chicken breast which wasn't on the menu but they were happy to oblige.  The food was so delicious that  I actually got kind of nostalgic for Jersey and the Manalapan Diner on Route 9.  I judge a breakfast place by their eggs and I was not disappointed one bit!  My egg whites were light and fluffy and not the least bit greasy.  Husb said that his chicken breast was perfect as well.  Our friends were very happy with their meals as well.  Top it off with the fact that Oaks is inexpensive and my Sunday was made!  We will be back - soon :)

I love Sassi.  On Wednesday evenings during the summertime they hold a wine tasting with half price appetizers.  My girlfriends and I make it a regular outing and are sad that it is discontinued in the fall and winter.  That said, when I had to select a location for a business dinner, Sassi was the first place that popped into mind.  The atmosphere is what really makes Sassi special.  When you walk through the courtyard and walk through the heavy wooden doors, you know that you are going someplace special.  The restaurant is furnished like an old, Southern Italian farmhouse that is so warm and welcoming that you just don't want to leave.  The service is impeccable - our water glasses were always filled and finished plates were whisked away before you even noticed.  Our dinner party of 4 enjoyed the house specialty of homemade pasta with roasted vegetables and the grilled pork chop battuto.  The pasta was just delicious.  The pork chop was slightly dry but the braised runner beans that it was served with were amazing.  All in all, our experience at Sassi has been consistantly great.  Our guests were very happy and we will certainly be returning in the near future.

This is our old stand-by place.  We stumbled on this place as we were buying our house and were driving around the area.  We found ourselves hungry and ducked into Saba's which is located in a small shopping plaza in Carefree.    The decor is not particularly noteworthy but we were just wanting to grab a quiet and casual meal.  While the restaurant itself is rather nondescript, the food is DELICIOUS.    The portions are extremely generous and flavorful.  I highly recommend getting one of the sampler platters for an appetizer so that you can try a bit of everything.  I myself am a huge fan of the falafel.  I seriously could eat it every day.  The lamb shank and the gyro are out of this world and the pita is homemade daily.  The family that owns Saba's are salt of the earth people who truly take pride in the meals that they serve.  They go out of their way to make sure that you are pleased with your meal.    If you are up in the Carefree area and want a fresh, flavorful meal in a casual and friendly atmosphere then Saba's is your place.

Freaking adorable.  I am always on the hunt for places peddling tasty treats as well as adorable packaging ( I worked in advertising in a former life).  I am well aware that packaging adds to the price in most cases but I am a total sucker, which leads me to The Scottsdale Bakery and Cupcake Company.  The tasty confections are not the only things dripping with sugary sweetness!  The shop itself is quite pink and girly, my husband would never venture in here without some measure of awkwardness.    The women who run the shop are extremely helpful and creative, showing me many of the things that they can do in terms of gift ideas and trays for my clients.  Everyone was a pleasure to speak with.  I ended up buying a dozen and a half assorted cupcakes for about $57.00.  A tad high for all of that cuteness but did I mention that I am a sucker for packaging?  I gifted these little cakes to an office who just went crazy for them.  They were almost too cute to eat but once they all dug in they could not say better things.  As I mentioned, the price is a tad high but the payoff is well worth it.  I will definately be coming back.

LOVE this place.    The atmosphere and the decor  is classy and the vibe is decidedly sexy.  While on the smaller size in terms of space, it is far from cramped and uncomfortable.  I celebrated my birthday here with some girlfriends and we had a fantastic time.  While I don't drink (not court or rehab mandated either) my friends raved about the Premarita Margarita, their signature drink made with Partida tequila and agave nectar.  We also thoroughly enjoyed the guacamole which is made tableside.  Since some of the ladies prefer their guac a bit spicier than the others, our server was happy to accomodate our requests.  I had the chicken tacos which were the perfect size for me.  I think that a man may look at the 3 small tacos on my plate and wonder what else was for dinner but for me it was perfect.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and had a delicious flavor that just spicy enough without searing my tastebuds off.    For desert, my friend made me a home-made birthday cake that she brought in and for a small cake-cutting fee, was presented to me (with trick candles and sparklers no less!)  The service that we had was top notch.  Brian, the owner, made sure that we were taken care of and helped to make the evening special.  The bartender and server were both attentive, quick, and friendly.  All in all, it was a wonderful birthday dinner.  I have never had a bad experience at The Mission and can't wait to return.

If I could give them NO stars, I would.  We have eaten at the BluBurger location on Jomax and had a great experience.  Good food, decent service, no complaints., so when a new location opened up around the corner from our house we decided to check it out with our neighbors and their 2 kids.  I arrived first and went to put our name in for a table but instead I waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  The hostess finally came over and when I requested a table for 4 adults and 2 kids, she let out a sigh and told me that they were completely backed up and could not seat us.  Confused, I scanned the dining room and counted no less than 4 empty tables and 3 teenaged waiters milling around aimlessly.  Dude, the hostess hasn't even met my neighbors kids yet and she was already throwing us out!  At this time, the rest of my party arrived and I let them know what the hostess told me.  My husband walked over to her and asked why she wouldn't seat us mentioning the open tables.  The hostess told us that they were short staffed and backed up in the kitchen but she will seat us anyway.  She also added that we would get no service, not even water, for 20 minutes or more.  WTF.    I have never in my life encountered such a thing in any restaurant - especially one that was newly opened, the smell of fresh paint still in the air.  Certainly not the way to treat potential customers.  Instead of sticking around and starving, we all ended up at Pei Wei a few steps away.  Apparantly we weren't the only ones annoyed with the rudeness of BluBurger.  Within minutes of us sitting down at Pei Wei, 3 other groups from BluBurger walked through the doors.  They got tired of waiting as well.  So, can't comment of the food at this particular location but the attitude that we got there was so atrocious that we will not be going back.  Ever.
