Ok time for the obligatory annual non-food-related review.   Piestewa definitely makes its way to my top 3 for hikes in Phoenix. Setting aside the fact that I've only hiked 3 mountain trails in Phoenix so far, it's actually probably my favorite one to do.  1. Convenience - It's only about a 10 min drive from my apartment, making this the perfect location for people who also live at my apartment complex  2. Going the distance - It's a decently arduous 3 mile hike - 1.5miles up and 1.5 miles back..ish (we had a fit-bit user with us to verify this distance)  3. Workouts & instagrams - It's as intense or leisurely as you make it. Good mixture of incline, rocks, 10ft tall cacti, and a gorgeous 360 degrees of Phoenician cityscape.  Unfortunately Piestewa is no hidden jewel and there are droves of people out in full force in every not-summer month. The only time I would guess the parking lots aren't full would be from about 11am-?? I'm not really sure when the evening crowds start their treks as I've only done this hike in the morning.

Tasty, authentic vietnamese food at vietnamese prices! This place is always pretty packed/busy, but the service is fast and the food is bountiful and filling.  While the pho is good I prefer to go with the wonton noodle soup or the com tam dac biet. I also feel a little less guilty whenever eating here because it tastes more like a homecooked meal than a greasy, heavier meal I'd order at some other sit down restaurant. Only a slightly less guilty though. Whatever, I'm still coming back here multiple times a week! They close around 830 or 9pm too so make sure to plan ahead of time so you don't arrive right as they lock the doors on ya.

Came here for a lunch study break, and it was so good that I totally forgot I was studying! Just keeding. Really though I when I ordered my breakfast burger I have to admit I was expecting the usual greasy/salty burger, but to my pleasant surprise it was cooked perfectly and not overly salty or greasy. Overall the burger had a very nice balance of meat to egg to cheese to bacon. What more can I hungry guy ask for? The truffle fries were very tasty as well and a good portion for 2 people to share.  I will definitely be back here soon to try out the other tasty looking burgers.  And also, for a Thursday at 11am, this place really filled up quickly...do people not have work??

At first I was a little hesitant about the $44 (tax and tip included) price tag, but once I got my food I was pleasantly surprised.  There are a ton of options, and since they regulate how many people are getting food at a time, there isn't too long of a wait for the more popular items such as the meats.   There basically wasn't anything I didn't like (but I'm generally easy to please anyway!).  My only regret is that I only had one stomach because there were definitely items I wanted to try but didn't have room for!   The dessert section is like a tiny little store within the restaurant itself, with an ice cream bar and thousands upon thousands of assorted chocolate fruit cups and pastries. Again, I wish that I could surgically augment my gastrointestinal system with 3 or so more stomachs to contain all that tasty food!

This place is definitely overrated. In terms of Vegas currency, yes $5 a slice is "cheap", but I don't think they quality of pizza they serve is worth it at all.  They even try to trick people into thinking they are snagging a great deal if they buy an entire pizza, which is $30 for 3 toppings. I ate here twice, once when I was pretty drunk and once when I was sober, and it tasted the same both times I came--slightly burnt and overwhelmingly greasy. The long line is due to the slow pace of the pizza makers and cashier, not because of popularity of this hard-to-find pizza joint.

Similar concept and price as Pieology in Irvine -- Unlimited toppings on an 11" pizza for $8...how can you go wrong? From the creative (making 2 different halves on 1 pizza) to the artisanal to the economical (everything on it plz!) you can eat any kind of pizza possible.  For ingredients they have a fairly decent selection of meats and veggies but not as much as Pieology. Still, it's definitely enough for me though. And being so close to the hospital, I will definitely be back soon yumz

Tasty burritos on the way back to my apartment? Yes please! I always go with the carnitas burrito because it's made just the way I prefer it: tender, braised pork with a seared/crispy outside. Friendly service and decent prices (~$8 for a fairly sized burrito that fills me up) in addition to a consistently tasty burrito are what keep me coming back for more. And more. And more.
