Love this place.  Such a gem!  Did not eat but the food smelled delish.  Coffee was great, crowd was buzzing and DJ was a great touch.

This review is long overdue.  Kristin has done my sunscreens now for two houses and I've been happy with the results both times.  Work is always done on time and at a fair price.  The products are great quality and I will never do my sunscreens with another company.

Our server was great but generally the service was a little slow.  food came out really fast.  Brussel Sprouts seemed pre-made and were not very crispy.  Generally food was good but not a place I would go out of my way to go for given its about 20 miles from home.  Would definitely visit again if nearby.  Plus - they do have a great deal on Monday/Tuesday for a pizza and bottle of wine / pitcher of beer for $20.  Thats worth going a bit further for!

Underwhelmed.  Service was very slow.  Ordered duck fat fries that came with cold hollandaise and were caked in salt.  Crispy chicken thighs were anything but crispy and cauliflower rice casserole was soupy with minimal barely cooked rice.  They lived up to the name though with all dishes being really salty.  Restaurant is pretty and could be very nice with some changes to the kitchen.

Waited for 15 minutes before anyone even noticed us waiting to be seated.  Food was moderate til I found paper in my mashed potatoes.  Best fried chicken of Phoenix - definitely not.  Get some personality for your servers and focus on good food and timely service.

Drinks were outstanding; food is almost as good as citizens (my fav restaurant still).  Service was top notch.  Will definitely go back.  More of a hip version of citizens public house.  Also good to note that parking is really easy here which was a concern of mine when I made the reservation.
