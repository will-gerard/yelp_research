Most of my reviews for Asian restaurants in Phoenix begin with something like, "it's good...for the area," but this place is just plain good. I'm a pretty serious Thai food snob and--even when I lived in Chicago--I only frequented a handful of Thai places. That being said, I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer at Wild Thaiger.  My husband and I gave it a try for Dining out for Life when our first choice had a long wait. I've never been so happy I couldn't get a table somewhere.   We sat outside on their patio which I would recommend to anyone. It's open yet cozy and comfortably cool.   For our appetizer, we had the seafood pancake. I've never had anything like it but the description sounded too good to pass up. It's a crispy pancake full of sprouts, scallions, shrimp, mussels and squid. It was delicious and really unique.   For dinner, I ordered the Decha Boar. The description listed it as being perfect for the "true Thai foodie." With a description like that, I had to order it. The dish was spicy and flavorful. I'd caution anyone not familiar with Thai food that it might be a bit too spicy for you even if you like spicy foods. Different chiles effect people differently. My husband ordered the Ginger Fish. The sauce on the fish was like liquid crack. I could've taken a bath in it. Long story short: it was SO good.   I'll definitely be back to try some of their other menu items. They have a smaller menu compared to most Thai places and I believe this allows them to focus on perfecting a few dishes instead of doing lots of mediocre things with Thai flavors. Check this place out!

My husband's parents took us here for his birthday and we all had a great time. We sat on the patio which is a must. You get a great view of the field and much better--and cheaper--food than you'd get in the ballpark. The cheaper drinks are reason enough to visit this place.   I had the Jack Daniels ribs and they were great. Everyone enjoyed their food which came out quickly despite a large crowd on the patio. The drinks were the best part. it's nice to be able to watch a baseball game with a pint of Guinness or a mojito instead of semi-cold overpriced beer.   The best part of going on your birthday is that they skip the annoying song on the patio but still bring you a free dish of ice cream.

The food was pretty good. Their sides are better than a lot of "Mexican" places. I only gave it three stars because it's close to several other Mexican restaurants all of which have much better drinks and drink specials. The atmosphere was nice but my husband hated all the tacky gazing orbs. They might've been xmas decorations, though. Everything was good and I know I'll go back, but only because I can walk there. Great service from everyone we interacted with and all of the staff were very thoughtful and informative.  UPDATE: I've upped the review a star since going back. Their $9.99 pick 3 combo really is a great deal. I'll be back again!

I wasn't expecting much from a chain sushi restaurant but the food was surprisingly good. I love sashimi and only ordered a small amount because of my trepidation. I wish I'd ordered more because it was very fresh and tasty. The rolls I sampled were the Tootsy Maki, Spicy Tuna, and Vegas roll. Spicy tuna was my favorite but the Tootsy maki was also really good. I love anything with eel sauce. My husband loved the Vegas maki but there was just too much going on in it. I did love the fried lotus chips on top. Seriously, why don't they sell those things by the bag? The cocktails were just okay. Go for the happy hour because the prices are ridiculous afterward. $8.50 for a California roll? I think not! The service was extremely fast. Our sushi came out with our drinks. The wait staff were very friendly and answered all of my questions thoroughly. And, I enjoyed sitting out on the patio even though the view was of a parking lot. I'll definitely go back for more...but only before 7pm!

My in-laws took my husband and I here to thank us for helping them move. I've been wanting to try this place for over a year and I wasn't disappointed. When you first arrive you're greeted with 360 views of the valley. It's an excellent spot to take some pictures--especially at sunset.   We were promptly seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant after a trip down the slide. We had a great view even though we weren't right beside the window. That was nice. I hate going to a place with great views and staring at the back of the kitchen all night.   We started with the rattlesnake and cactus fries. I'm glad I tried these unique offerings but I'm not sure I'll try them again. No trip to the Rooste would be complete without them. I had the barbecue chicken and it was delicious. My husband had a burger and his parents had pork chops and prime rib. The cowboy beans are the best I've had. Everyone left happy with a full belly and leftovers to spare. The beer is reasonably priced and served in giant mason jar "pitchers." The best part is that every meal ends with complimentary cotton candy.   This is a great place for families and they have a full bar for the adults. Don't miss this place if you're visiting Phoenix and if you live here, why haven't you visited already? Say "hi" to Horney the Bull!

They have a great green curry and huge spring rolls. Their beef and broccoli is just okay. I know, beef and broccoli? Well, it can be great. I've had beef and broccoli that's worth talking about. Anyway, the food was great and the portions were huge. I just moved to the area and I'm happy to find a thai place ALMOST as good as my favorite haunts in Chicago. I'll definitely go back.

This is a great Asian buffet. I don't come to places like this expecting haute cuisine and I didn't find it. However, I was surprised at the variety of entrees and by how fresh everything looked and tasted. The best time to go is during the week for lunch. The buffet is $8.99 and you get unlimited sushi made to order by a sushi chef, build-your-own Mongolian stir fry, and six buffet stations of various Asian dishes. I love Asian noodles and their three varieties were delicious. I especially loved the duck noodles. Don't leave without trying the green beans.  Additionally, you can observe the Native Phoenician in his natural habitat. Marvel as the gargantuan beast waddles toward the buffet line with two plates in each hand. Legend says that a Phoenician can eat three times his own body weight in one sitting. This is a great place to test the theory.

I don't know why Yelp describes this place as "coffee and tea" when it's a full blown restaurant/sandwich shop. My husband and I were passing through downtown Gilbert and their patio just looked too inviting to pass up. We split the Rancher and Farmer sandwiches and each got a beer. They really have a great beer selection. The sandwiches were delicious and huge. We each took some home and had a great late night snack after a Suns game later that day. The roasted vegetables on the Farmer tasted fresh and were still vibrantly colored. The Rancher was the perfect blend of bleu cheese, beef and horseradish. Even the sides were delicious. They should sell their bean and corn salad by the gallon. Even their pasta salad was filled with fresh tomatoes and basil as well as freshly made mozzarella pearls.   The atmosphere of this place is also pretty great. The patio is simply decorated and naturally shaded by trees. I'd imagine it probably stays pretty nice even during the summer. The staff was beyond courteous as they answered my numerous questions about the menu and one of the cooks even came out to ask how we were enjoying our meal.   I really can't wait until I have an excuse to go back. I've only lived in AZ for a couple of months but this might be my favorite place. I'm from Chicago so I have pretty high standards when it comes to restaurant patios and this place rivals some of my WIndy City favorites. Don't check this place out if you're in Gilbert; go to Gilbert to check this place out!

I recently stayed a night at Wigwam during a conference for my husband's job. We didn't order any food, but all of the events were catered through the hotel so I'll review that too.  Grounds: The first thing you notice are all of the beautifully manicured green spaces. Each path is lined with flowers and palm trees. The smell of fresh-cut grass and roses filled the air. There was a downed palm tree in the middle of a lawn, but they cut it up and hauled it away before lunch. The pool areas are also very nice and adults are allowed on the water slides!   Food: At each event there was a buffet of fresh fruit, canapes, and assorted beverages. These were always delicious. I especially enjoyed the beef kebabs. The conference also included a three course dinner which was great. The dessert was just okay but I'm not much of a dessert person.   Accommodations: The rooms were nice and comfortable. They stayed cool during the day and offered lots of privacy. I do have to knock them down a star because our bathroom was dirty. Really the only thing to complain about.

I ordered takeout, so I won't be commenting on the actual restaurant as I've never been. Our order arrived surprisingly fast as this really isn't a city set up for speedy delivery. The food was great for the price. I wasn't expecting haute cuisine like other Asian food snobs. I can tell by how a menu looks and what the prices are whether I'll be getting delicious greasy 90's style Chinese takeout or not.   I tried the orange chicken, hunan beef, and cashew chicken. I also had some appetizers. Everything was good. The portions were huge and we had another meal the next night with leftovers. Order the family combo. It's worth a try and it's only $22.  I'll definitely order from here again.

I went here for dinner and drinks with my husband and sister-in-law last weekend and we had a great time. The three of us sat outside and that's what I'd recommend for anyone visiting AZ 88. The atmosphere is much more relaxed and less sterile than the interior dining area.   We ordered the ceviche as an appetizer and it was delicious. Being from Florida,  I'm sort of a ceviche snob. It wasn't the best I've ever had but it was very good and I'd definitely order it again. The homemade tortilla chips really elevated the dish to another level. They were the perfect texture. They started very crispy but softened just the right amount when piled with ceviche.   My husband and sister-in-law ordered the grilled cheese and both of them liked it. I didn't try any of it...because neither offered me a bite. I guess that it was too good to share! I had the cobb salad and it was fresh and tasty. The bleu cheese dressing was good and the crispy bacon was perfectly cooked.   The best part was, by far, the drinks. I ordered a Moscow Mule and it came in a copper mug. It's always supposed to be served like this but so many places around here cut corners and serve it in a glass. The acid from the limes has to react with the copper mug in order to create the true flavor of a Moscow Mule and I really appreciated their attention to detail. Also, I was surprised that the drinks weren't more expensive. They were by no means cheap but I just expected them to be a lot more at a place like this.  If I had to say anything negative it would be about the bathrooms. Don't get me wrong, they were clean and well-kept but the doors were confusing. They had changing lights under the doors and everything was glass. It was confusing...especially after several drinks. Is it too much to ask for a picture of a man or woman on the appropriate bathroom door?

On a whim my husband and I decided to stop in for brunch. I'd heard good things about Fez but as a Chicago foodie I have a ridiculously high standard for brunch. I have to say I was quite impressed. I had an omelet with gyro and feta which was delicious and surprisingly light considering all of the heavy and spicy ingredients. The bloody mary was also nice and spicy. I went back the other day for dinner and had the marrakech salad with salmon. Even the half salad is a good-size portion and the salmon was delicious. Everyone else with me ordered different burgers and they all loved them. There's something for everyone at Fez whether you're an adventurous eater or you crave something more traditional. The staff was really helpful, too and gave us great drink recommendations. Go on a thursday for a cheap G-spot!

They have a great happy hour. My husband and I got a huge platter of fresh and delicious sushi for a really good price. They aren't cheap with the booze either. I ordered well scotch on the rocks--half price at happy hour--and it was a nice full glass. The sushi was very good, too. The salmon skin was really crispy and delicious though that particular roll is a handroll in most places so I was a little disappointed that it wasn't here. The decor is really nice and trendy. It reminded me of some of my favorite sushi joints in Chicago. I'll be back soon! Oh, and if you go you have to try the tuna jalapeno poppers. They aren't like normal poppers. Just try them!

This place has a serious identity crisis. "Gay" is not a sufficient theme for a nightclub. Everything inside was really haphazard. There was no rhyme or reason to the layout or decor. Four go-go dancers crowded one stage and only one of them received tips. There are two level and an outdoor area yet the dancers grouped in one area. It's not that big of a deal, though. They should get rid of the dancers altogether and hire hot dudes to work the bar. Dancers at gay clubs are just...well, it's been done. A lot. And a lot better. By worse bars. Additionally, they let in bridal shower parties and then announced them over the PA. Um, I'm married to another man but it's not legal in this state but a gay bar is going to celebrate some annoying drunk girl and her friends? Sorry, but I'm from Chicago and bridal parties should be banned from gay clubs until we have full marriage equality. And finally, the drinks were extremely weak. I doubt I will ever go back to this place.

My experience was pretty good but a problem with the bill has led to me give this place a low rating. We went on my birthday and had their $20 birthday coupon. I specifically asked the waitress if we could order off the happy hour menu before we ordered anything. She said it would be fine as long as we ordered more than $20 off the regular menu. When the bill came she said the manager told us we could either get happy hour prices or $20 off the bill. I wouldn't have ordered $20 worth of full-priced sashimi  a la cart or an extra carafe of sake if I thought this would be the case. I wasn't happy about this and I won't ever go back to this place. The waitress didn't even say "Happy Birthday" to me even though she insisted on looking at my license to verify that it was my birthday. There really isn't anything special about Kobe so I'd suggest you go to RA for sushi and Benihana for teppanyaki.

On a recent trip to Arizona, my in-laws took my husband and I to Joe's Farm Grill for breakfast before we had to go to the airport. I've never been to a restaurant like this before. It's actually a little hard to describe. There are two places to eat. There's a cafe and a grill. I'm really not sure if there's a difference. We were going to go to the cafe but the line was really long so we went to the grill. This required walking through the outside areas and gave me a chance to take in the whole place. There are community farm plots outside and several interesting outdoor eating spaces. The coolest was one around a massive oak tree.   The restaurant is in an old converted house and some dining areas still look like a 50s-style ranch--which I think is pretty cool. Anyway, on to the food. I had the Huevos de Farm Grill which was good but not exactly what I was expecting. It's scrambled eggs with pulled pork, beans and fried tortillas. It was good but I didn't expect the pork to be mixed in with the eggs. My husband had the breakfast tacos and they were really good. Everything was fresh and delicious. Nothing tasted processed or fake. I'd definitely go back for the food but probably on a cooler day so I could sit out by the oak. The drawbacks are that you eat on plastic plates, which somewhat ruins the whole eco-friendly vibe, and the bathrooms are outside. The bathrooms are really cool. They have Barbie and GI Joe dolls encased in backlit shadow boxes. They really went for the 50s nostalgia. It feels like you're in a spaceship. However, I just really don't like going outside to use the toilet unless I'm sitting outside.   Like I said, this was overall a great experience and I would definitely go back the next time I'm visiting my family in Arizona.

I went to Switch with my husband to celebrate the anniversary of the day we met. We were looking for a spot downtown to eat that wouldn't cost too much and decided to try Switch.  The location is nice and the atmosphere is great. they have a patio out back and an open dining room with strategically-placed decor to create a more intimate feeling.  To start, we ordered the sun dried tomato risotto. The portion was much larger than I expected for $3.95 but the dish was just okay. I tried the martini of the night but didn't like it so we switched drinks. For the main course I had the chicken pot pie galette and my husband had the turkey and brie galette. I really liked mine but there were too many veggies in it. A good chicken pie needs only flaky pastry, rich gravy and tender chicken--not peas, corn and tomatoes. The seasonal side dish was sauteed pea pods with onions. It was unexpected and surprisingly delicious. My husband's galette was good. In fact, it was even better than mine.   You're probably wondering why I'm giving this place four stars and the answer is SERVICE! Since moving to Phoenix, I've found most places lack skilled wait staff and management who know how to effectively run a place and take care of their customers. Our waiter was a little late bringing my second drink. I'd only just started to wonder what was taking so long when he showed up with the drink and said it was on him. I don't remember his name but he had a killer mustache. Taking care of your customers makes them want to come back even if they didn't like everything they ordered.  I'll definitely go back to Switch. They have amazing specials every day and their burgers looked delicious. Go to this place!

I had a great experience at Benihana last night. My in-laws took me there for my birthday--seriously does anyone go to Benihana for anything other than their birthday? The food was great and our chef, Jeremy, put on a great show though I did notice some of the other teppanyaki cooks were a bit more animated.  The onion soup, salad and shrimp appetizer were as good as ever and the signature Mai Tai in a Buddha mug was delicious. I ordered the Splash 'N Meadow and asked for my meat to be cooked medium rare. It was the perfect texture and temperature. The shrimp were great, too. My husband had the mango shrimp and really liked them though he did mention the sauce was a bit sweeter than he'd anticipated.   The staff was really great and made sure we all had constant refills. Our server was very attentive and helpful when ordering. Go here for your next birthday but make sure you go online and get the free birthday coupon first.

This has to be one of the Valley's best kept secrets. They have sprawling grounds on which to picnic with salads and sandwiches purchased from their counter. Even though the place was packed for their Olive festival there was plenty of room for everyone to spread out and eat without feeling like you're on top of each other. They have tons of samples of wine, olive oil and some very creative tapenades. Don't leave without a jar of the red onion and fig tapenade. It's really unique and delicious. They have an oil for every occasion and some unique infusions such as meyer lemon, chile, and even chocolate olive oil.

I just moved to Phoenix and was looking for a good drink special for lunch. If you go to Arriba at 3pm you get the overlapping lunch menu and happy hour special. 99 cent margaritas! I spent $23 and got two big lunches and four delicious margaritas. They have a nice patio with cool murals and a big waterfall. The inside is also nice with a big bar area. I had the green chile burrito and my husband had the Rio Grande enchilada. Both were good and had some spice! It's nice to see a southwestern restaurant that isn't afraid to use a little heat. I'll definitely go back. I just hope I can find someone to drive me because those margaritas are too good to pass up.

The only good thing about this place is the intimate setting and the beautiful decor. Otherwise, I was disappointed. The hookah was supposed to taste like coffee, pistachio and jasmine but it all blended together into a muddy mess. The drinks were overpriced. If I don't specify a rum then give me well. Don't pour me the expensive stuff. I didn't try any of the food but who goes to a hookah bar to eat anyway? All the waitstaff seemed more concerned with restocking the fridge with redbull than asking me if I wanted another drink. The absolute worst part was the music. A DJ came in and started playing Pussycat Dolls and Eminem. What is it, 2005? Current music played at an appropriate volume would have been nice instead of blaring hits from six year ago. I won't go back.

Really average. I went their for someone's birthday dinner. Everyone kept talking up how special the place was and I was expecting a lot--especially for the price. My food was good. I had the spinach salad with grilled sirloin. The steak was pretty good and the salad was fresh and tasty. However, they didn't put cheese on my salad. They also forgot it on someone else's salad. The salad wasn't cheap enough for them to forget a major component such as goat cheese.   My husband had the bleu cheese filet and really liked it. The white truffle macaroni was good but they used oil instead of shaved truffles. It was all good but should have been really special for the price. And--seriously--how can a place called "The Keg" have only five beers on tap; two of which are Blue Moon and Coors Light?  The service wasn't that great, either. We asked for steak sauce twice and were almost finished eating when it arrived. The waiters and staff did not step aside and let patrons by. Several times a waiter squeezed passed me brushing up against me. They can't say "excuse me" or slow down for a second? The place wasn't that busy.   I won't go back. The food was good but I could get a much more special dining experience for the same price.

Pretty good food for a sports bar. I've been twice: once at the height of Friday night and the other midweek for lunch. Both times the service was quick and the drinks were replenished just in time. Like many sports bars in the area the wait staff seems to be more about being a hot chick than a great server, but when the food comes quickly and the drinks don't run dry there's not much room for complaint. The burritos are good and pretty standard for a chain. The salads are really good and very big. If you're watching what you eat then go for one of them and you'll leave full and satisfied. I tried this place for the groupon but I'll definitely go back...especially for their drink specials.

This is a fun little place for tacos and light Mexican fare. I had the ceviche and my husband had some tacos. The carne asada is some of the best I've had in the area. The ceviche was delicious. It wasn't overdone and loaded with unnecessary ingredients. Simplicity dominates the small menu at America's Taco Shop and the focus on quality is evident in the food. The best part is probably the price. Everything is so cheap! If you want a light lunch then you could get out of there for around four bucks but if you're really hungry drop a ten and unhinge your jaw. The hot sauce was also quite good. Very smokey and spicy. Great beer specials on the weekend!  The restaurant is small but they have nice little patio with misters. Perfect place to stop for lunch downtown. I'm excited to go back when I'm hungrier. Their burritos looked delicious.

Jimmy Woo's has some really interesting and delicious takes on Chinese/Pan-Asian standards. I tried the spinach and crab, singapore noodles and a few sushi rolls. Everything was fresh and delicious. The spinach and crab might even be the best I've had. The singapore noodles were perfectly seasoned and plentiful. Seriously, what's the point of ordering noodles if you don't get enough to take home for a midnight snack?   The cocktails were pretty great too. I can't remember what my drink was called but it was like a chocolate mint mudslide. Very refreshing way to end a meal. It's a definite step up from most of the Asian places in the area which i'm discovering are pretty lame. I used to live in Chicago and have high standards for anything Asian so trust me when I say this place is worth checking out.

It was hard for me to find a salon like this when I moved to AZ a couple months ago. By "like this" I mean like the male salons I'm used to in Chicago. This isn't a full male salon but they still offer MOST of the services I use. Brody gave me a great cut. He knew exactly what I was talking about and it looked great. When I told him i was new to the area he got a map and circled places and told me about them. That was really amazing. He didn't have to tell me about every cool bar and restaurant in the area but he did and it's going the extra mile that  will make me a return customer.  The negatives: The coupon thing and rebooking incentives just seem cheap. An occasional promotion is fine but I'm not one for a bargain basement haircut. Also, I just personally don't like hand massages and would prefer something like an eyebrow trim as a bonus during my cut.  Not much to complain about. I'll definitely go back to Brody!

Good, cheap tacos. They were better than I was expecting. I only had fish tacos but my husband tried some of the other varieties and liked them. Cheap beer, too. Good no-frills tacos and beer are enough for me to come back again.

I've never been to the bakery but Tina made the cake for my "Welcome to Arizona/Congrats on your wedding" party last month. It was a decadent and delicious two-tiered cake with the top being lemon and the bottom chocolate cherry. No one could stop talking about how great it was and even the leftovers were moist and rich.The cake was beautifully decorated and was appropriately masculine while still being fun. Think of them for your next event! I can't wait to try some of their other pastries.

I'm glad my brother-in-law wanted to go here on his birthday or I never would've tried the place. I could never figure out how to say the name so I planned on avoiding the place until nuclear annihilation comes for us all. Anyway, the food was pretty good.  To start I tried my sister-in-law's salad because they brought her the wrong size. It was a decent garden salad. I ordered the NY pastrami stack, and while it wasn't stacked quite as high as a traditional NY deli sandwich, it was still very good. They use real grain mustard which is essential. My husband had the buffalo chicken pizza and said it was good. I didn't try it because I'm not a fan of chicken pizza. I also tried the pretzel bread appetizer. The breadsticks were great but the cheese sauce was just velveeta and I didn't like it.  For dessert we tried the "one hot cookie." It's hard to go wrong with warm chocolate chip cookies and vanilla ice cream. This was probably my favorite part of the meal.  The service was great even though there were a lot of people in our party.  I'd definitely go back and try some of their pizzas and micro brews. The prices are great too.

My sister-in-law had been telling me about this place for a few years but we'd never gotten around to trying it. Over Thanksgiving weekend we finally made it there with her and her husband. I wish we'd tried it sooner! We had a really great time and the food was delicious.  We came right at the tail end of happy hour so we got the individual beer pitcher special. Five bucks for a pitcher? I'd be a total alcoholic if I lived in Gilbert. The beer selection is pretty good and those individual pitchers are not tiny. They also have a really great wine selection. My sister-in-law and I had the Sangiovese and we both loved it.  At her recommendation, my husband and I got a bruschetta board. You get to pick four of their unique bruschettas and they're served on a cutting board. We liked all of the ones we tried but I think my favorite was the one with pistachios and figs...or maybe they were dates. I can't exactly recall. Did I mention how cheap the beer was? LoL I was tempted to order another board and try more varieties but the panini looked too good to pass up. It was really good and they split the order for my husband and I with no additional charge.   The atmosphere was really nice. We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful fall weather. Even though the patio was packed it didn't feel crowded. Everyone has their own space. If we didn't have plans with our parents-in-law later that evening I could've eaten and drunk another round of everything. This place is at the top of my list the next time I visit my family in Arizona!
