I was in need of two front tires and a friend refereed me to your business. I'm glad I found you, because the service and quality that I received was outstanding. I will be needing another set to complete the four. Guess where I'll be going? Thanks S&S Tire of Peoria.

We are new to the area and decided to go eat at Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen in Goodyear this past weekend. Unfortunately it has closed due to the economy. We have eaten at the Surprise location several times and loved it. We noticed Dino's across the way from Picazzo's and decided to try them out. It was nothing special. Drinks were the only thing that was good..... We will not go there again!!!!!

We ate here over the weekend and the the food was excellent. It has really come a long way, since the last time I had eaten here. It can keep up with the big dogs.... I recommend it highly!!!
