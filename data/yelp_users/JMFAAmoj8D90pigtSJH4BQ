Of the four Vietnamese restaurants I've tried in Las Vegas and Henderson, this is the best. And it's because of the pho -- the reason I visit any Vietnamese place.  Although I prefer veggie broth, I'll admit that the pork broth used here for nearly every type of pho is tastier. Just not healthier. The soup has come out remarkably quickly during a couple of my visits, which is helpful when I'm pressed for time because pho isn't exactly a dine-and-dash experience.   The quality of the sliced chicken is the highest of any pho place I've visited in Nevada; when I got a bowl recently at a pho place in Northern Nevada that I also rated four stars, there was no comparison. That place rates highly amid the dearth of good ethnic food in Northern Nevada, while this place rates highly in a foodie's paradise.  If I have one quibble with the aforementioned foodie's paradise, it's that some Las Vegas-area restaurants play current popular music a bit too loud in what appears to be a sad bid for hipness cred. It's annoying and diminishes my enjoyment of my meal. Fortunately, this place is nice and quiet. There's music playing and a TV on, but neither interferes with my enjoyment of my meal.  A word to the wise: I showed up about 9:20 p.m. recently, 40 minutes before the restaurant closes, and I was seated. People who showed up after maybe 9:30 p.m. weren't; they were told they could only order food to go.   The only real negative I can see about this place is its location, in a not-so-nice strip mall. I realize that "not-so-nice strip mall" might seem redundant, but even by strip malls' middling standards, this one looks kinda dirty. Once you're inside, of course, that's not a concern.

If you ever want to introduce about 50 of your friends to Ethiopian food, Axum is your place.  The huge dining area was dark and mostly empty when I visited on a Monday evening. I stood at the entrance for maybe 15 seconds, as my arrival seemed to spur some confusion -- perhaps because I appeared to be the only non-Ethiopian among the nine people in the establishment, which I took as a good sign. I then was led to my seat, and a male host asked if I'd eaten there before.  I said no, and, fearing he might have interpreted that as meaning I'd not had Ethiopian food before, I inquired about the kitfo. He assured me it was good, but I opted for the vegetarian combo -- the barometer by which I evaluate Ethiopian restaurants.  The dish didn't come quickly, but it was worth the wait. The split peas and lentils were well-spiced and tasted distinctly different from each other, and the presence of collard greens was most welcomed. Some Ethiopian places don't offer them as part of their veggie combos, and while I would have preferred potatoes to either pea pods or one of the two sections of salad on my plate, the combo's more notable for what it contains than what it lacks.  The injera was a little thicker and more bitter than at similar restaurants I've tried in town, and I was given just enough to scoop up the entirety of my meal. The host stopped by perhaps three times as I ate, and I assured him I was quite pleased with the food. It bordered on a little too much attention, which I'll take over not enough attention.  A couple of small downsides: I asked for water and was given a bottle of it, which costs a couple of dollars. I'm sure that's because the tap water isn't good to drink, a common issue at Las Vegas-area restaurants. But it still amounts to a $2 tariff on a meal. And the eatery's front window is covered in extremely visible fingerprints, which doesn't give an impression of cleanliness even though everything else seemed well-kempt.  According to Ethiopian culture, when dining you're supposed to use your right hand 'cause the left is reserved for, ummm, other things that happen later. I choose to eat with my left anyway because I'm a lefty. No one at the restaurant gave me a funny look over it, so bonus points for that.

My friend and I were famished and craving Mexican food on our way back from a day trip to Death Valley National Park, which is beautiful but doesn't have the greatest restaurant scene.  Middling-at-best Yelp reviews steered us away from the Mexican eateries in Pahrump, and we initially stopped at another Mexican place that advertised being open but wasn't at 5:15 p.m. on a Sunday. I'd expected I'd have to settle at Roberto's, but I can't imagine anything else we'd have visited would be better.  The size of my chicken burrito surprised me, given that it costs less than $4. The chicken wasn't too dry, yet the burrito wasn't greasy or otherwise overly filled with fat. The restaurant has one type of red salsa -- a really spicy one, which I liked. I ordered a bean tostada, not knowing that the burrito alone could have been divided into two meals. The tostada, too, was a great value at less than $3.   Our food was served quickly; it no doubt helped that we were the only two people in the restaurant. My only quibbles with the place are that a.) the styrofoam cup I was given for my water was tiny, and b.) the only napkins available are the ones you're eventually given with your food. I spilled on myself at the salsa bar and had to wait to clean up.  Roberto's is open 24 hours, which would have come in more handy for me back when I worked nights. It's good to see there's a quality option for those who do work different hours.

A 4.5-star Yelp rating steered me to this place after I'd attended a NASCAR race outside town. I was visiting a friend in Las Vegas, and I must say I was spending time in my state's large-and-incredibly-different-from-everywhere-else-in-Nevada outlier as much for the great food as for the race or anything else.  When my girlfriend, friend and I walked into this place, I initially thought I'd made a mistake. The seating area isn't large, and one orders from a not-huge menu that's posted above the cash register. A very pretty woman who appeared to be the co-proprietor flashed me a smile from the kitchen, which cooled my sudden desire to instead check out the hot dog restaurant next door.  I'm sure glad it did. I quickly realized that I'd never tried about half the food on the Las Cazuelas menu, including the esquites -- which this place defines as "steamed corn kernels prepared with a touch of lime, mayonnaise, cotija cheese and chili powder." The chili powder comes on the side, so you can control the spice level. It was a treat to try something so unexpected and great. I've been to hundreds of Mexican restaurants in big cities, and I've never had esquites. Elote apparently is a cousin dish, only the corn is still on the cob. It's also served here.  I also got a couple of types of the pork tacos, which are nice and small, and sampled my dining partners' quesadillas. The meat in all the dishes tasted fresh, and the salsa had enough kick that I had to blow my nose more than five times --Â which is the measure of a quality place for me. The salsa served with the quesadillas is different from the salsa served with chips at the beginning of the meal. It's spicier.  My only complaint about the meal was that I ordered water and was given a small styrofoam cup. I generally need lots of water when I'm eating spicy foods because although my brain loves the spice, my Northern European body doesn't. I had to get up to refill on water far too many times. It's worth noting that I'd just spent four hours in the sun, so I was parched coming in.   This place doesn't sell alcohol. There's really no reason it should, given that the entire dining experience lasts 20 minutes or so, but it's worth noting for those who might want a cerveza with their meal. The lack of frills at this place ends up being one of its greatest virtues, as the prices are good, as is the treatment by the proprietors. I won't be back because I live far away, but if this place were in Carson City, I'd be there multiple times a week.

I'm a sucker for good wrap restaurants and was pleased to learn this place is across the street from my new workplace, so I entered with high hopes.  And ZiKiZ didn't disappoint. There's a good variety of protein offerings for the wraps and bowls -- I went with the chicken -- and they're accompanied by good side-dish options. If you're going to go with a side, go ahead and get a combo with a drink; it's a much better value that way.  I'm looking for a bit of an escape when having lunch, and because this place attracts a line at the counter and the seating is bunched close together, I don't always feel I get that. However, the big-screen TV plays ESPN, which is right up my alley and gives me something to gaze at other than queued-up diners' midsections.  A combo meal easily becomes two meals, as I'm not able to finish a wrap in one sitting, let alone a side with it. Kudos to the restaurant for having both hot sauce and jalapenos as toppings.  That said, the spicy sauce isn't all that hot, and I was surprised when I asked for extra spicy sauce recently and was told it'd cost a bit extra. Really? For something with the consistency of watery barbecue sauce? Are a couple of extra squirts of that really going to come up at the next shareholders meeting? The employee relented, for whatever reason, when he learned I was ordering a combo.  My other quibble is that the wraps are served on foil, even if you don't get them to go. I prefer to eat with a knife and fork, and I quickly tear through the foil when doing so. It'd be nice to have access to plates and spicier sauce. It also would be nice to get more than once small piece of pita bread with the hummus side.  Some of the employees are especially friendly. I'll definitely be back here many times.

I told myself I shouldn't distrust the place just because it's called the utilitarian-sounding "Mr. Sandwich." After all, Homer Simpson's Mr. Plow business was a success, and "Mr. Blue Sky" is one of ELO's best songs, right?   Unfortunately, I should have followed my elitist instincts and skipped this place. I should note that I've heard good things about the sandwiches and fried rice here, but I don't judge Vietnamese restaurants based on those dishes. I judge on the quality of the pho, and it's lacking here.  When grocery shopping, I used to stock up on packets consisting of a small amount of rice noodles, a bit of oil and flavored powder. Although the noodles were billed as "Asian," they paled in comparison with anything served in a restaurant and served as little more than a small, mildly satisfying snack.  The seafood pho I got at Mr. Sandwich bore a remarkable resemblance to these packaged soups, right down to the noodle texture and bitter undertaste. The seafood didn't impress, nor did the sliced tomatoes (?) included in the broth.   The restaurant's atmosphere was similarly underwhelming. On a hot summer day, one of the doors was wide-open, leaving the seating area uncomfortably warm. No bean sprouts or sliced jalapenos were served with my soup; I had to ask for them. The non-bottled water tasted bad -- a not-uncommon problem at desert eateries. And the food didn't arrive quickly.   This place might be a great experience if you're looking for banh mi and bottled water on a late-fall day. But I advise against replicating my poor experience.

The veggie combo I got here has the unfortunate distinction of being both the skimpiest and the priciest I've ever been served, and I've ordered them in 11 cities and four time zones. My first thought when it was served was, "Wait ... is that an appetizer?" My plate came with the requisite lentils and cabbage, as well as pureed potatoes in place of the customary solid ones.   The two problems with the servings: their size, given that the plate they were served on was largely injera, and a lack of variety. I'd been hoping for greens and yellow split peas, which commonly come with vegetarian combos along with salad greens.   I was tempted to order kitfo -- raw beef -- to fill out my plate but took comfort in the fact that at least my bill likely would be small. Surely, a veggie combo that's half the size of some I've been served elsewhere would be half the price, right? Quite the contrary; my bill was more than $14 for about $7 worth of food.  The restaurant's atmosphere is a saving grace; it's bright and inviting. There's free Wi-Fi; you just have to ask an employee for the password. And while I've had to work to get employees' attention at some other Ethiopian restaurants, that wasn't the case here. People were quite friendly.   Based on some other reviewers' pics, perhaps visiting here as part of a group results in getting more food and better variety. But if your solo experience is anything like mine was, the results will be underwhelming for both your palate and your pocketbook.
