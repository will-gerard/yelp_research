In response to the business owner's response, I'm not really buying it.  Being honest about the diagnosis of a car is only half the battle.  Being honest about pricing is just as important.  And these guys totally failed.  Implying that technicians who charge less than them are somehow lower quality is just bullshit, plain and simple.  They wanted to charge us more than $600 to put on new brake rotors and pads.  Retail for those parts?  About $150.  Hours it takes to swap them out?  One, or two, at the most.  Naturally, when I called them and sounded like I actually knew what I was talking about, they knocked $150 off the price they offered my wife.  Still not good enough.  It was $300 cheaper to tow our car all the way to our trusted Mesa mechanic and have him do the work.  Oh, and the inspection we used a Groupon for?  They charged us for services that i later found out were supposed to be part of the Groupon.  Going to call them today to try and get a refund for that $30 (?!)  tire rotation.  Hate to rag on a local business, but the only way this could've gone worse would've been if they straight up lied about problems with the car.

Yummy, creative sandwiches!  Good prices.  Highly recommended.  Service is generally a bit of an issue, so if you are one of the prissy eaters who doesn't understand that serving can be tough, you'll probably get your panties in a wad.

This place is great if you hate things that get all assertive with your taste buds!  I really have no idea how they managed to make their food so bland.  Maybe if they spent some money on a recipe book instead of a graphic design campaign, they'd do a little better.  The fact that it won something from the New Times proves how corrupt that process is.

wellp, time to get out my rocking chair, reading glasses, and suspenders.  modified was hands-down the best venue in town back in 2003, when i saw my first show there.  black eyes, q and not u, and french toast.  one of my favorite shows ever.  i hate to say anything negative about the place, but i think there is one tiny nitpick worth mentioning.  since 2003 the venue has changed bookers multiple times.  there is still usually some good shows every month, but the shows in general have gotten a little more conventional - for lack of a better word.  the local support for shows here used to be a little bit more representative of the pastiche that is phoenix's rad local music scene: country bands playing with metal bands, joke rap with thrash bands, etc etc.  i think the trunk space is more geared towards that now.  modified is still a great place to book/play/see a show, though.  just don't hesitate to make suggestions to the volunteer staff who run the sound - sometimes they need a little guidance.  the person who started it, kimber lanning, is a bad ass.  the venue is tiny, like everyone says, but definitely not as tiny as everyone makes it out to be.  i've been to countless sold-out shows there, and it definitely feels smaller when it is the summer.  but that's part of what can make a dance party so memorable.

The potato tacos!  So good!  This place is a fun restaurant to take out-of-towners to get the full Mexican food experience.  A big, diverse menu, with a panaderia and a little grocer as well.  Highly recommended!

CHILAQUILES! CHILAQUILES! CHILAQUILES!  They are like a punch in the gut that you will ask for over and over again.  Also, the little sammiches at the bakery counter.  With a slice of ham, a little bit of melted cheese, and a roasted pepper - on a sesame bun.  Worth ever literal penny you will pay for them.

BEST FLOATS/MILKSHAKES IN TOWN!  Veggie friendly diner food... pretty good tater salad, nice sandwich selection.  Homemade veggie burgers.  Nothing on the menu will blow your mind, but it is a fun, delicious little place to eat, with awesome sodas/dessert drinks.

In my mind, there are two types of Indian restaurants in the Valley that I can afford to eat at.  There's the ones in strip malls that typically feature a grouchy old man behind the counter and a huge TV displaying Indian MTV or soap operas, and largely do-it-yourself service. (See: Kohinoor)  If I'm feeling like spoiling myself, I'll take the next jump up to the places with painted walls, friendly waitstaff, and a-la-carte style menus instead of "specials."  After a long day at work and in hippy progressive meetings, me and my beyonce decided to try Indian Delhi Palace, which is an excellent example of the latter.  The waiters were attentive without  being overbearing, and the complimentary appetizer - I always forget the name - the crispy, slightly sweet cracker thingamajig with the green sauce? - was yummy.  And the samosas we started off with were also great.  Not overly greasy or soggy or stale like a lot of Indian places.  The palak paneer is wonderful!  Ask for it spicy if you are a fan of spicy foods.  The creamy spinach flavor doesn't become overbearingly hot, but has a pleasant spicy aftertaste that mixes perfectly with their garlic naan, served fresh, of the soft and chewy variety that I prefer.  RE: The people who miss paneer... The paneer was definitely on the skimpy side, but I didn't mind.  The taste was definitely still there - perhaps they blend it in more than other restaurants?  Anyway, if you are a huge fan of blocks of paneer in your food, you might want to mention as such to your server.  The lady ordered vegetable bhriyani, which is sort of our Indian comfort food, and it didn't disappoint.  Flavorful rice with tons of veggies.  Indian Delhi Palace has good food, good service, and an atmosphere that will embrace you like a vampire who feeds off of stress instead of blood.

Pricier than your standard Mexican comfort food place, but still on the cheaper side.  Burritoes come with a little salad and rice.  I had the best bean and cheese burrito of my life here.  And, they serve coke in glass bottles, from Mexico!  Definitely recommended if you are in the neighborhood.

What is it about the anonymous Chinese buffet that draws me, like a moth to a flame, knowing full well that I will be disappointed?  I suppose the 2 or 3 good experiences I have had, ever, at any Chinese buffet, anywhere, have spawned within me an eternal optimism - that I will stumble into a beautiful buffet table full of home-cooked Chinese food, tasty and tasteful.  In reality, it seems that 98% of Chinese buffets serve the same stock dishes, with varying levels of mediocrity.  The orange chicken here was actually tasty; everything else was greasy, super salty, and, sometimes, lukewarm.  There were about 8 dishes total, with the usual fried accouterments, plus the worst sushi I have ever had in my entire life.  If you are desperate and pressed for time, this place will do - otherwise, avoid, and spend your $7 somewhere else.

This place is solid.  Great carne asada, but stay away from the burritos.  This place leans towards the authentic, and burritos aren't actually all that authentic.  A torta or tacos will do you much, much better - especially the tortas, which aren't stacked ridiculously high with cheap meat like most of the tortas in town.

Holy cow, I didn't realize I hadn't had the chicken here when I wrote my first review.  This place has become our unofficial work conference room.  Everyone is drawn to the magical chicken - moist and tender, with a crispy skin that bursts with flavor.  And ridiculously cheap - $10 for the whole bird, with fixin's.  The frijoles charros they serve before meals is worth the trip alone - I don't know what they do to them (it definitely involves bacon), but they are fantastic.

5 for pies, 3 for slices.  Slices are pretty hit or miss - sometimes they pop out stale, with the toppings obviously thrown on last minute, and sometimes they come out lovingly crafted by the Hephaistos of pizza in the fires of delicious.  If you order a pie, then you're guaranteed freshness.

This place has the best view of anywhere in the Valley.  Words don't do it justice - we were lucky enough to show up for our reservation as a massive storm was rolling from the East Valley towards Phoenix, the sky divided.  Wow.  The inside of the place is nice, too.  Very date-y kinda place all around.  With such a gorgeous setting, I wouldn't have been surprised if the place slacked on food.  Such was not the case.  Top of the Rock makes a real effort to use locally sourced products, from the produce to the cheese to the beer, which is always a good sign.  We started with a shrimp dish.  Almost everything about the dish was great - housemade gnocchi, local sausage, figs, a subtle honey-lime sauce.  Sadly, the shrimp didn't live up to the rest of the dish.  It was overcooked and rubbery.  Still enjoyable!  The highlight of the night was the salmon dish, served over quinoa.  Some of the best salmon I've had.  In stark contrast to the shrimp, it was simply prepared, tender, and moist.  The only complete letdown of the night was the vegetables.  Having been lucky enough to go to Noca a few weeks earlier, we'd just had perfectly prepared seasonal roasted vegetables that provide a perfect counterargument to people who think a plate full of veggies need be bland or boring.  This was the opposite - blandly prepared vegetables in a buttery-tasting sauce that didn't really justify the price tag.  Top of the Rock is a great place for a cocktail, some nosh, and would be a great start to a romantic night on the town.

This score is for the pie.  I have never exchanged cash money for anything else here, and don't ever plan on it.  Why spoil a perfect relationship?  If you're ever on your way to/from the Great, Frosty North from the Valley, and you want to become everyone's favorite attendee of a pot luck in your near future, purchase any of the pies at this wonderful pie-ery.

Review is for the sandwiches only - because they're so good, I don't really wanna order anything else.  Chewy, tasty rolls, fresh toppings, and cold cuts.  Scratch that - not just cold cuts, but also tasty eggplant parmesan or chicken cutlets.  It's a fairly simple formula, but it is surprising how many places get it wrong, right?  Also, service is always brisk and pleasant, nice for lunchin'.

Everything I've had here has tasted of sadness.  The tortillas were stale, the beans were flavorless, and the eggs were no good.  This place might cut it in another city, but with the abundance of cheap, delicious mexican food in phoenix, take a pass on norteno's.

the trunk space is the best place to see shows and the best place to play shows in the valley.  the owners are friendly, awesome people, the drinks are yummy, the art for sale is always interesting and affordable.  newcomers are welcomed with open arms, and the trunk space family is always in full effect.  as an added bonus, the bikini lounge is right next door!

For starters, appointments are meaningless.  I understand some delay in seeing a vet - emergencies happen - but the half-dozen times we brought dogs here, we had appointments every time except for one, and they were always at least a half-hour late in seeing us.  More if you count the time when the appointment "started" because we would wait in the exam room for another 10-15 minutes before the doctor came in.    To make matters worse, the people who worked the desk were completely unapologetic and downright rude most of those times, too.  I put up with it because we liked the vet we usually saw there, and while the prices seemed high they were also comparable with other Phoenix vets, I guess (how weighing a dog qualifies for an "exam fee" I'll never understand).  The final straw came when one of our dogs cut his paw fairly badly.  Right off the bat, they charged us $60 to inform us that he had been cut (Thanks, doc!)  They wanted to charge us $650 to sedate him and stitch the cut.  They refused to offer any other alternative.  By the time they saw us, the wound had stopped bleeding, and he barely flinched when touched.  Total time they spent with him: 10 minutes.  I was outraged, because I knew glue - or at most staples - would do the trick.  I went to another vet and was completely right.  A few days later the wound was completely healed without the use of sedatives and for many hundreds cheaper.  (I hate feeling like a cheap skate when it comes to my dog's health, but in this instance I knew I was right - stitches and sedatives were completely over-the-top.  It would be like a doctor prescribing LASIK when all you need is a pair of reading glasses - it would fix the problem but wouldn't be at all necessary.)  To make matters even worse, I thought we'd settled up at the desk of the office.  Turns out not, and without getting a phone call from the office, they turned our account over to collections.  Over 60 lousy bucks that they didn't even earn in the first place - we'd been taking our dogs there for more than a year and they couldn't take the time to call us first.

As a sissy vegetarian, I feel compelled to mention the soup that no one has yet mentioned at Da Vang - THE TAMARIND BASED SOUP HOT POT IS AMAZING!  I don't know if they use any other animal broth in it, because I am willfully ignorant of such matters.  Regardless, if you are a meat eater or a vegetarian, try the tamarind soup, and bring friends.  It is super yummy.  They also have a rice-based soup.  And, if you talk to your server, they can likely recommend some vegetarian/tofu based dishes that will be wonderful.  Everything else is as good as everyone says it is.  Wouldn't be surprised if people got an occasional bowl of sub-par pho; every family restaurant makes mistakes.  I'd recommend everyone try it again.

The restaurant is perfect for people who conflate all food south of our border with Mexican food (as if it weren't bad enough that people conflated all of Mexico's food with one, imaginary "Mexican" food - but I digress!).  The menus is varied, with plenty to please carnivores, omnivores, pescatarians, and vegetarians.  Everything we tried was great, starting with the oat drink.  The only experience I've had with avena was at a Costa Rican place in Chicago - they served it milk-shake style.  Here, the drink was light and refreshingly sweet, tasting like a healthier pineapple juice.  The Mexican tamales were the best I've had in Phoenix - fluffy and savory, with just the right touch of cheese and peppers.  I can't wait to try the rest.  Entree-wise, try to order something with the aji salsa.  It's like a little pico de gallo from hell - spicy to the extreme, but not in a stupid novelty hot-sauce kind of way.  The spiciness is part of a delicious ride that will highlight the rich flavors of the rest of your dish.  I tried the shrimp-stew - which was delicious without being overly rich.  There was a flavor that was familiar and strange all at the same-time.  It was like meeting your long-lost mother, and then having her cook you the comfort food you would've grown up on if you hadn't been separated from her at birth.  We also had the plato sin carné.  This is not the standard beans-rice-sad-salad vegetarian option that a lot of places serve up.  There was a hearty lentil concoction served with perfectly cooked rice, an over-easy egg, perfectly cooked plantains, and - the crown jewel - some sort of vegetable mush-pudding concoction that the menu referred to as flan, covered in a little bit of what tasted like hollandaise sauce and served on a crisp lettuce leaf.  The varying textures and tastes of the flan/lettuce/sauce combo - which was nothing like the custard-y dessert I normally associate with the word - tasted even better as cold leftovers.  For who isn't normally inclined to drive from central Phoenix to the northwest corner of the city, Mi Cocina Mi Pais is perfect for a date night when combined with the dollar theatre a mile or two down the road.

What the fuck?  Seriously, why do people think jokes about starving Ethiopians are funny?  Should we start off reviews about Jewish bakeries with Holocaust jokes, or Chinese places with the Rape of Nanking?  "Hey, I really enjoyed this Japanese restaurant!  I thought everything would be  MICROWAVED though, GET IT? BECAUSE EVERYONE DIED IN AN ATOMIC EXPLOSION!"  Anyway.  Classic Tempe debate: Lalibella vs. Blue Nile.  I like Blue Nile more - relaxing atmosphere, slow food, and the raw nights are really cool.  I've only tried the raw chef's food once - we had the sushi - and it was really out of this world.  I used to scoff at the idea of raw restaurants, but now I can see the appeal.  The food does seem to have gotten a little less flavorful over the past couple years - it's still good, just more subtle.  I have a feeling if you ask for things spicier, they'll accomodate you.  Don't be afraid to chat up your waiters/waitresses if you have any questions, or are a fan of Ethiopian food who doesn't see what you want on the menu.  When I lived in Tempe, I was here enough to be something of a regular, and the wait staff would ask if we wanted to try out new dishes, which were always fantastic.

Five bucks for a bottle of Miller Lite says pretty much everything you need to know about this place.  Also, if you are planning on attending a show here, plan on paying for parking.  I have seen some terrible sound guys here, but it's hard to say if that is the fault of the Marquee - a lot of bands that would play here tour with sound people.  The majority of the problems here are problems with venues of this size everywhere in the country - the parking, the over-priced shitty beer, the strip-search upon entry, the lack of re-entry.  Still, if there was any competition for a venue in that part of the Valley that could handle bands that are as popular as the bands that play at the Marquee, they'd be hard-pressed to do a less-enthusiastic job of it.  Also, the sloped floors make it easier to see a band from further away, but they also can KILL your back.

I have only one thing to contribute to the discussion on this Oregano's: THE VEGGIE WEDGIE SANDWICH IS THE BEST VEGGIE SANDWICH EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRR.  Fried veggies + goat cheese + focacia + dipping sauce + waffle fries = heaven.  My favorite method for eating at Oregano's is to either go really early, or call in an order for the V.W. and lounge around feeling fat and happy while watching trashy television.

Oh, Kohinoor!  How I miss the days when your vegetarian specials were but $3.99.  Heaping piles of rice, tofu, and vegetables for a sum no man could refuse.  Vegetable Bhriyani that could mend broken souls.  Even still, when you did raise your prices to $4.99, it is still worth it.  The endearing old grouch who runs you and bakes your delicious sweets only treats his customers so gruffly because he does not know how to express his love for them, which he must obviously have to be the purveyor of an establishment that serves good food at such ridiculously low prices.  (RE: Amandia M.'s review:  yes, you will pay way too much if you order off the regular menu.  Stick with the specials and you will not find a better deal - $4.99 or $5.99.  If you want a drink, go with the mango lassi - it is pretty good, and will be worth the price, unlike the sodas.)

The menu here is hit or miss, but when it hits, it definitely hits.  I'd recommend trying the spicy eggplant and the veggie mu shu.  the mu shu remains my favorite of almost everywhere i've ever eaten - and i got around chinatown in chicago, believe you me.  the rest of the menu that i've tried is average-to-good, but those two dishes really are worth a visit, especially at lunch time.  the restaurant itself?  i love the unintentionally kitschy aspect of it.  the superfriendly staff have been there a long, long time, and have obviously decorated how they want to see it.  after ducking in there every couple months while going to school down the street, it started to feel like my second living room.

I never wrote a review of Caffe Boa before Payton Curry took over, because I didn't have much to say.  It had a great atmosphere and a great location, but the food was usually close to forgettable - not so bad you felt ripped off, but not so good you would get a rumble all up in your belly-space when you walked past.  Yeah, this was the kind of ritzy joint that was the de facto special-event date place in college by dint of location.  However, with tickets to Beauty & the Beast at Gammage and a Groupon in tow, we decided to give the new menu a whirl.  I gotta say, we were pitched a perfect game.  The shrimp adriatico had us sneaking finger dips into the leftover sauce it was so good - rich and vibrant, the shrimp cooked to smooth delectability.  The panzanella was the best-presented salad I've seen in my life, the croutons were delectable, the proportions were spot on, and the greens tasted fresh.  The tajarin was also a lesson on balance - not too creamy, not too rich.  I can't say I would've recommended the old spot to anyone but an ASU kid without a car, especially with La Bocca right down the street, but now, yeah.  Way to go, Sir Curry.

So, we've been back a couple times since we last visited, and the food/service has been pretty hit-or-miss.  Most disappointingly, the last time we went, we ordered two of our previous favorite dishes - the shrimp adriatico was abysmal.  6 small, withered things, swimming in a sauce that lacked the punch or zest of the previous chef's days, arrived with the toast burnt.  Not just over-crisped, but straight up blackened.  The mussels were also poorly prepared, limp and lifeless.  Sad!  Hopefully this Mill institution gets back on its feet.

Alright, since it doesn't seem to be passè yet, I'm going to qualify my review by saying I spent two weeks in Spain, and the tapas here would be gobbled up just as quickly there.  Also, be prepared for a wait if you eat here.  They do take reservations, but even then, due to the nature of tapas, you might end up waiting a bit for your table.  For starters, the red sangria is delicious.  Hands down the best sangria I can remember, and deceptively strong.  The first time I had it, I underestimated it, and got close to embarrassingly tipsy in front of co-workers.  Almost all of the food is done perfectly, too.  The favorite of myself and my co-workers is definitely the boquerones - little bites of heaven.  I'm not exaggerating when I say we almost order a plate for each person at the table.  The tastiest slivers of sardine with roasted peppers and avocado - amazing.  The pulpo asada is hit or miss, but when it hits, it is probably some of the best octopus I've had state side.  The salmon tartare is really, really good, too.  Stuffed dates are rich, but very, very good.  Patatas bravas are spicy and crisp, and wouldn't be out of place in Barcelona.  This place cooks a mean steak, too.  Everything else on the menu (yeah, I've tried just about everything) is good.  The only disappointment I've had is with the shrimp - not that it was bad, per se, just not up to the standard set by the other seafood dishes.

The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because one should really know better than to book a hotel room for like 17 bucks and expect anything other than a dump.  I arrived here after a long day of work, and waited in line for 45 minutes to check in.  I was relieved until I realized I had to walk like half a mile through souvenir shops, closed restaurants, and casinos before I got to my room.  The room itself was also pretty bad.  I don't expect much from hotels, but two limp pillows and a mattress that felt like a crappy cot didn't make for a restful evening.  I think I would've felt better sleeping on the floor - like, if you aren't even going to try to give me a mattress that makes my back say "hey, this is ok," then don't even bother.    Maybe there's an appeal if you have kids?  But if you have kids, what are you doing taking them to the strip?  Why not just take them to a real amusement park and not a playground for adults?  Quit being cheap and selfish.  Go to Disneyland or something.

For the price you pay here, you get a better experience than a similar-priced place on the strip.  I'm in Vegas at least half a dozen times a year, and this has become our go-to place for work stays - the rooms are reasonably quiet, the beds are comfortable, and they have a pool and a fitness center.  You don't have to walk through a casino and a bunch of crappy shops to get to your room.  If you do want to wander to the strip, it isn't very far - you're a couple blocks from Bally's.  You don't have to go far for good eats off-strip, either, including my favorite place in Vegas, FireFly.  I imagine it would be a good place to base a fun weekend trip.  Also, as corny as the theme is, it is kind of relaxing to walk from the parking lot through shaded alleys with lots of foliage after a long day of meetings.  Only downside - there's no wi-fi in the rooms unless you pay, which is ridiculous considering the high resort fee.  You can get free wireless in the public areas, though.

Alright, let's move beyond the whole best-pizza-in-the-country conversational paradigm for just a ding-dang minute, folks.  This restaurant has created a wonderful way to enjoy your meal, something that is truly (and sadly) unique in Phoenix.  The long wait becomes an opportunity to relax - to slow down, and sip wine in a charming cottage, on a grass lawn, surrounded by historic brick houses, in the shadow of the modernist science center.  The wine and beer list is well-curated, the staff is attentive, and the carefree pace continues throughout the night.  Once seated, you are served in an environment that is casual but respectful.  Last time I went, the couple at the table next to us got their check 15 minutes after we sat down - and they were still there when we left.  The food isn't always impeccable - and where else is it, at $12-15 a person?  But the ingredients are always fresh, the dough is delicious even when soggy, and the atmosphere cannot be beat.  Honestly, it's something people don't talk about enough.  This is a place that is heralded as (at least one of) the best pizza places in the country, and a schlub like me can afford to take my beautiful wife.  We can both enjoy a glass of wine, a night under the stars, and delicious pizza for under $50.  Well done, Pizzeria Bianco.  Well done.  If you are coming here with your guard up, daring them to impress you, and aren't willing to slow down and embrace the whole experience, go to Cibo or Parlor or something.  That's not a knock on them, I'm just saying - if you can't take it down a notch, don't be a party pooper.

deeeeeeeelicious coffee.  lux taught me the difference between good coffee and great coffee, and for this i am eternally grateful.  this is definitely the best coffeeshop amongst the many that orbit downtown to get some solo work done.  the furniture isn't really set up in a way that's conducive to conversation, and i've never seen strangers meet here.  for that reason, it's not really a good place to have a work meeting, for example - the tables and couches are almost always occupied enough that you can't gather more than two or three people without being separated.  this changes when the weather isn't blistering - they have a great patio with more group seating.

i was a bit turned off by the ambience the first time i came here - same as at lux, it kind of feels like you are stepping into an ikea catalogue.  unlike lux, though, the atmosphere gets friendlier the longer you hang around.  where lux always feels more like an office, drip definitely feels like a neighborhood joint - albeit with contemporary furniture choices.  there's a really sweet dog that runs around the place occasionally, and the owner/operator is super friendly and chatty if you want to be.  it's one of those coffee shops where you can sit and work, but there's also usually an opportunity or two every hour to jump into a convo that starts between the barista and the patrons and spreads around the cafe like a friendly communal blanket.  not that people are talking loudly - it's just a small space, so you'll be able to hear what everyone is saying unless they are speaking quietly.  the espresso is yummy.  note to the guy who got gas from an actual chai tea - that's how a chai latte is supposed to be made, man.  it's like complaining because someone gave you fresh juice instead of juicy juice.  also, the bathroom area is awesome!  i don't know why.  i just really like it.  fair warning: the chairs are not very comfy.  even the ones in the middle of the room.  which look like they are begging to hold your fanny in a warming canvassed embrace - they leave you cold and a little stiff.

i used to come here with my roommate to grab an iced chai and do the crossword puzzle on our lazy, halcyon undergraduate afternoons, or come in for a warm breakfast and a cup of coffee, hungover after an amazing houseshow the night before back in the neighborhood.  this is that kind of place.  great, relaxing place to do homework or study.  depending on the day and the time, you'll find professors, honors college kids, hipster bike folk - the whole gamut of the non-party-bro asu population.  food is good, but a little overpriced, i think.  drinks, like any independent coffeeshop, depend on the barista, but i've never had a really bad drink experience here.  i especially like the dirty chai.

When I walk into a barber shop, lazily non-maintained jew-fro in tow, I usually expect to see the electric clippers come out right away.  No questions about style - just "how short would you like your buzz?"  That's why I usually save my twenty bucks for a conciliatory meal afterwards, and shave my own head.  New York, New York is different, though.  They actually styled my hair.  While I watched Russian television.  I'm not sure what style I would call it, but it looked - professional!  Nice haircut and a shave for $20 plus tip - not bad at all.

Hard to believe that this cocktail lab faces the insanity of the Fremont Street Experience.  Don't get me wrong - I love Fremont.  But DCR is pure class next to one of the world's biggest mines for hokey-ness and over-the-topping.  If memory serves, the place is kitty-corner to the Heart Attack Grill, for Pete's sake ("OVER 350 LBS EATS FREE!!!")  The drink menu here is one that has been crafted by people who clearly love to experiment and have fun.  It rotates seasonally, and drinks are given a value based on their ABV (I think).  I'm sure there's some duds every season, but the sheer ambition makes up for it.  Not to mention the alcohol-to-dollar ratio.  All the other essentials are in order, too.  There's a decent amount of seating, and the music isn't super overpowering.  Bathrooms are clean.

This is a great bar on a weeknight.  Drop in and you can brush elbows with the proud and the few who don't think downtown Phoenix is lacking in culture or things to do - Arizona democrats, starving artists, veteran weirdos.  Although the Leaf does lack a tap, the beer and wine list is great, especially if you like strong beers.  servers are always friendly and attentive.  art is always nice.  when there is live music, it is always good.  also, their toilets are made of solid gold.  I hate to criticize a place for it's popularity, but during the weekend and especially during artwalks, Lost Leaf can get crowded really, really quick, and the space is small enough that conversation can get drowned out pretty easily.  No worse than any other bar - just a heads up!

Ah, the lazy, cheap liberals of the internet!  With regards to pricing whines:  shut up.  Seriously.  It's a little more expensive than Ranch Market, Food City, Sunflower, or Sprouts, but on an item-by-item comparison, you can definitely very easily save over Basha's, Fry's, or Safeway, and you can DEFINITELY DEFINITELY save over "fresh" produce options like Whole Foods, AJ's or Trader Joe's.  Like any other shopping experience, you just have to be savvy and cognizant.  There is one word why this market is awesome, and should be the envy of every other city in the winter months.  It starts with "p" and rhymes with "vulture."  Out of guesses?  PERMACULTURE!  Phoenix, far from being the completely unforgiving desert most imagine it to be, has been an agricultural valley for centuries, largely because the weather and lack of harsh frosts allow for nutritional plants to be grown  year-round.  Try finding fresh produce at a farmer's market in Chicago in December!  Or better yet, don't.  I've tried, and it sucks.  The prices of produce vary here on natural factors:  when a crop is near the end of it's growing season, price will go up, as less product will be available.  In the spring, you can get beautiful chard for $1.50 a bunch - I don't know if you can beat that price anywhere - and other fresh greens for about less than you pay for "organic" crap in grocery stores.  Depending on the vendor and the conventionality/ease of growth of the veggie, you can definitely feed yourself here with modest to zero increase in your produce budget.  For example, carrots, potatoes, onions, and garlic are super duper cheap - and shallots even come in at way less than they do in the usual grocery store.  But if you want heirloom tomatoes, eggs, milk, or cheese, yeah, you're going to have to shell out a little more - but not to an outrageous extent.  As for atmosphere, if you want the whole farmer's market experience, definitely drop in on Saturday morning, when families and dogs are out in full force.  There will be a wider variety of vendors, live music, and a general lazy Saturday party feel . Wednesday nights are great, too, though, if you are one of the awesome people who lives in downtown Phoenix and you want to make it to the weekend with fresh veggies.  Also, there are tons of cool vendors who sell homemade crafts for affordable prices.  I've gotten many gifts here for my mom, lady friend, and assorted others.  Also, they accept food stamps, which is awesome.  Bottom line:  if you think adding another two or three bucks to your grocery bill in order to support local, sustainable and delicious produce is going to break your bank, that's understandable.  But don't complain about the prices here unless you are on the verge of bankruptcy.  ::Insert longer rant about how American liberals like to talk about sustainability and the environment but balk at even tiny increases in product expenses::

this may be the only restaurant i've ever gone to based on a commercial.  if you live in phoenix and have yet to see the pitic spot playing on one of the local access stations - the one with all the weird 80s music videos - you need to get to the bikini lounge one night and wait for it on one of their shiny new flat-screens.  it features a dancing girl, a soldier, and stop-motion garlic.  someone breathes plasma from their mouth.  but words don't do it justice.  the food here is really solid.  family-run place - it's been around for decades, apparently.  the atmosphere is nice and quiet, the food takes awhile, and it's a little pricier than standard mexican fare - but it's all worth it, the dollars and the wait.  well cooked meats, well-seasoned dishes.  just try not to fill up on the delicious chips and salsa they bring out.

Sunday brunch food is GREAT!  I'm a big fan of their toddy, but some of my coffee-snob friends aren't the biggest fans of the brew here.  Best environment in a coffee shop in the downtown area by far.  The staff is friendly, lots of comfy seating, free wi-fi.

In Florence for business, I followed my standard rule for eating outta town in a time crunch:  look for the closest, non-chain, most-crowded lunch place.  That brought me to A&M, and as usual, a solidly tasty lunchtime experience.  Interestingly enough, A&M is apparently a chain, with sporadic locations across the country.  They claim to have chosen Florence because the town's name reminded them of their Italian grandpa, who was their restaraunting mentor.  How cute is that?!  Pizza slices are prepped fresh, and are huge, thin-crusted, and greasy.  The sauce is tangy, and the cheese has flavor.  Mushrooms are a breaking point for me - nothing worse than getting served canned/jarred mushrooms at a restaurant - and the shrooms they threw on my slices were definitely fresh.  Definitely a dependable place to grab a bite if you're passing through.

We love the brunch here - they might have my favorite bloody mary in town, and the flatbreads and benedicts are delish.  All-in-all, though, some of the dishes I've had are just sorta... meh.  And not "meh" like "meh, i've had better," or "meh, this isn't my thing."  More like, "meh, for the price, this feels like they aren't even trying."  That can be kind of a bummer, because this place isn't cheap.  It isn't overpriced by any means, but it is a lot of coin to drop for something that isn't very good.  This sounds really negative for a four star review, huh?  But, really!  When this place does their thang right, it is really, really tasty.  And the atmosphere is really nice; a quiet, neat-looking former firehouse with classy decor.  Nice jazz for brunch.  A roaring fire on the patio during the winter.  My recommendation: steer yourself towards something with a baked good involved (benedict, flatbread, sandwich, roasted vegetables) and you'll be golden.

We had our wedding at the Phoenix Zoo catered by Heidi's. Wedding planning, as countless boring romantic comedies, tired sitcoms, and shitty comedians will tell you, is a daunting affair.  Having someone pro-actively handle the infinite details that go into the seemingly simple task of serving dinner was a huge relief.  The food at Heidi's is good - for a caterer.  We tried a lot of different businesses, and I think Heidi's was somewhere in the middle of the pack - not fantastic, but really solid, and practical for large groups.  They seem to have a good grasp on the idea that culinary experimentation can potentially alienate some guests - but they don't sacrifice all flavor in favor of the lowest common denominator, either.  The best part about Heidi's is their method of sample meals - they host quarterly (I think) parties where you can go and sample multiple "themed" meals.  Then, if you have special requests, you can go and have the food made specially for you (though we had to push a little bit, which was a little annoying).  Professionals on staff were always courteous and accommodating.  The service at the wedding was also very attentive.  One nitpick I have there - we rented a trellis through the company for the ceremony.  After the ceremony, we hung around the trellis for some pictures with our photographer - pretty standard, right?  the staff workers watched us like hawks, though, giving off a pretty impatient vibe - intentionally or not.  One important thing to note - Heidi's does not include estimated gratuity in their contracts.  They note this in fine print - but we missed it in the mess of all the other event planning details.  It would be nice to have Heidi's mention this to their customers from the get-go, since, like us, the majority of people planning their wedding are probably pretty uneducated when it comes to that sorta thing.  It was a bit of last-minute sticker shock, as almost every other caterer we got estimates from included gratuity, which raises the price pretty substantially.

Across the street from my work.  Everything I've had here is tasty, from the kibbeh to the falafel.  Hummus & baba ghanouj are obviously very divisive topics, but the baba-g here is the best I've ever had - so smoky!  so creamy!  The market is a great feature, too - olives & feta, lots of dried goods, seemingly out of place cookbooks from a serious called "this bitch can..." (e.g., "this bitch can cook for a party").  Not the best (or cheapest) Middle Eastern food I've had, and not the best market, but somehow the place is more than the sum of its part.  The rosewater lemonade is kind of what pushes this place into five-star territory - the stuff is DEFINITELY the best lemonade I've ever had, and hits the spot on our hot summer days.

I don't even care about authenticity issues.  I'd eat a sushi filled with a taco if it was delicious.  the food here is just criminally bland.

Great place to sit outside, grab a late dinner, and watch the crowds on the strip.  The burgers are pretty good - probably not worth ten bucks in most parts of the country, but, hey, location, right?

As a transplanted Southerner, I have to say that Memphis Best is the best barbeque I've had since moving to the desert.  I was expecting to have to give the place the benefit of the doubt - I was craving a turkey sandwich, and the true test of a barbeque joint - as anyone knows - is the pulled pork.  This turkey sandwich was beyond amazing, though.  Smoked & cooked to a consistency beyond smooth, perfectly complimented by the house barbeque sauce and the soft, just-barely-mushy-but-still-holdable-bun - delicious!    The coleslaw was a little lacking, but other than that - perfect.  Also, their potato salad here is delicious - just the right balance between sweet and savory, creamy and chunky.  Highly recommended.  The only downside about this place being a true Memphis experience is the lack of sides - I like my barbeque with greens or mac and cheese or any of the other sides served at barbeque joints in other regions, and just like in Memphis, the sides here are fairly limited.

Oh, Pollack Cinemas!  I don't even know where to begin describing your charms.  For starters, there is your choice in movies.  Not content to rely on blockbusters like most cheap theatres, you provide one of the few venues in the valley where we can see good, independent films.  You've shown flicks that AMC and Harkins won't touch, unless you you're willing to drive to one of their boutique locations in Scottsdale or the Biltmore and pay $11,000 a ticket.  Were it not for you, I would've been forced to watch Transamerica on a small screen.  There, there is the robotic band that greets all visitors as soon as they set foot in your welcoming walls.  Some people would question this.  They would ask, "Why would anyone ever install an animotronic band in the lobby of a cheap cinema?"  Thank you, Mr. Pollack, for asking the more difficult question: "Why the hell not?"  The robots set the mood for the out-dated arcade games and the bare-bones concession stand, for the wax figurines that line the hallways and the frightening picture of Mr. Pollack and Dick Cheney.  Yes, Pollack Cinemas.  You set the bar incredibly low with your $3 price of admission (lower on Tuesdays!).  And then you proceed to blow it up with ten megatons of dynamite.  Thank you.

A GUIDE TO THE STATE FAIR FOR FUDDY DUDDIES AND CHEAPSKATES SUCH AS MYSELF  First and foremost, the score for this event is based upon one thing: the fried pickles.  As a Southerner, the idea of frying a pickle is not so alien to me as to many of my more urban, east-coast elite friends, but the idea of dipping a big ol' honking spicy dill in cornbread batter and frying it on a stick?  Where I come from, we bread and slice our pickles.  At the risk of never being able to go home again, I must say, the Arizona Method blew my mind.  You have to try one.  Unless you hate fried food.  In which case, you probably hate life in general and won't enjoy the fair no matter what.  PRICE/WHEN SHOULD I GO?  First off, there are a ton of discount opportunities to get in.  Going early on a weekend, going to certain grocery stores, certain days, happy hours, etc. - $10 is not what you should pay unless you go on an absolute whim.  Same goes for tickets inside - you can usually find discounted tickets somehow with a little advanced planning.  Second, even if you do end up paying ten bucks, you can assuage your wallet-guilt by going on the night of good music or other cultural fun times.  There are a bevy of performers/events to choose from.  For me, there's always at least one performer worth checking out for ten bucks.  This year,  Bob Dylan.  Past years, Weezer, Beck, Weird Al, random old school hip hop folks.  There's also demolition derbies (!!!), and roller-derby, and other stuff.  PARKING  October and November in Arizona are beautiful!  Take advantage of the cool night weather, park down McDowell somewhere, and bring along a coke bottle with a little special whiskey inside.  OTHER FAIR ISSUES  Again, check the schedule!  Some nights are more country-riffic, with cows and livestock and crops.  I really do think most people who were dissatisfied with their fair experience coulda had a better time if they did a little upfront work.

I'm not normally a big fan of Italian food, but after marching six miles against 1070 in the Memorial Day weekend heat, I decided it was time to slang my Groupon on the table and carb it up.  And, fortunately, this was my favorite Groupon find yet.  Aiello's is in a beautiful building.  I don't think a building has ever detracted from my eating experience, but in case's like Aiello's, the wonderful shaded, verdant patio set the mood in all the right ways.  The inside is low-key family restaurant with a dash of romance.  Nice lighting, not too loud, cool bar.  The food was awesome.  Delicious, probably house-made pasta with simple flavors that let the sauces and vegetables sing.  An exhaustive - but not daunting - wine list - though it'd be nice to see more options served by-the-glass.  As icing on the cake, at the end of the meal, you get to play a game that might let you get your meal for free.  I won't ruin the surprise, but it adds a lot of character.  If I had an Italian grandmother, this is the sort of food I'd expect she'd make.  Highly recommended for a date night, classic dinner-and-a-movie style, for unpretentious delicious fare.

Best tortas in the area, period.  Miles better (and cheaper) than the much-fanfared El Guero, which is super overrated anyhow.  Tasty, chewy rolls, freshly grilled ingredients.  For filings, there's a pretty extensive selection - somewhere around 15, if memory serves - from simple staples to stacked monstrosities of delicious goodness.   My favorite is the Ranchera Especial - carne asada with a simple chipotle sauce.  The bigger guys are pretty good, too, and are no joke.  I come here at least 2-3 times a month for work lunches, and nobody has ever been disappointed.  Never ordered anything non-torta related, but they do have a full menu, including huaraches and various other non-standard but good Mexican items.  Atmosphere-wise, the place is nice.  Clean, bring colors, friendly-but-not-overbearing staff.  There's usually a soccer game or Spanish-language day-time talk shows on whenever I'm in.

Ready for today's introduction by way of tortured metaphor?  Crust is a pretty good restaurant that seems to be struggling with it's signature.  Is it the fine, loopy John Hancock of the hand-stretched Rustica?  The decorative and celebratory graffiti tag of a slice of New York style thin-crust?  The fun scribble of a salad served in a bread boule - described as "Crusted!" by the menu?  As far as I'm concerned, the ambiguity doesn't really matter.  We indulged in a little more here than we normally do at a restaurant, thanks to a super-awesome coupon.  Here's what we had:  A Tuscan salad of some sort, spinach-based in the aforementioned boule - crisp and tasty, not drenched in sauce.  The bread boule was definitely a nice touch.  The house-made croutons were fresh and delicious.  The artichoke dip was pretty standard fare - tons of cheese, with spinach and artichokes baked in, served with the aforementioned croutons and some not-so-fresh tasting tortilla chips.  Solid.  The pizzas - we got two Rusticas to split.  These occupied awkward territory, portion-wise.  Each was probably a a bit too big for most person to finish alone, yet too small to bring home a satisfying follow-up leftover party - definitely too small for two to share.  Still, for $8.50, you definitely get a satisfying penisesque-pie.  We ordered the one with pesto, which I was nervous about - a lot of restaurants serve their pesto pizza drenched in the oil-y goodness, but this was instead served with a tasteful red pesto sauce that hit all the right notes.  The other pie was a little more forgettable, but still solid.  My one knock on this restaurant - and why I would give it a 3.5, instead of a 4 - is the namesake - the crust.  The crust at the end of each piece was charred and hard.  Not crunchy, like a well-done wood-roasted pizza, like the pies at Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco, but straight up hard.  Still, in light of the affordability, tastiness, and nice, relaxed atmosphere, this place leans more towards 4 than 3.

finally!  great vegan food in downtown phoenix.  not that i'm a vegan.  but still.  the owners here are really nice and will chat you up about your meal, especially if you order something vegetarian.  the portions are smaller than most people will probably like, but, hey, it's healthy, and i've never left not full just from ordering a plate.  the menu is also somewhat limited, but everything on it is tasty.  i say this with authority as a guilty omnivore who has plucked food off of friends' meat plates.  also, the menu changes a tiny bit from time to time.  if you go, you must try the avocado-plantain spring rolls.  seriously.

I love a good vegetable sandwich.  I don't mind paying a premium for getting what I love.  Unfortunately, the veggie sandwich I had at Amuse Bouche - recommended by the server - was stunningly mediocre, considering my bill ended up being somewhere around $13 bucks for a sandwich and a few fries.  The aioli was bland, there was an amount of cheese that went beyond the realm of good taste, and the roasted vegetables were sopping wet from the marinade or braising sauce or whatever they used - oily and overpowering, not tasty and delicious.  I make occasional trips to Buckeye and Surprise for work, and was hoping to find a gem in the West Valley based on the reviews of this place.  It wasn't completely bad - just priced at a point they'd never be able to get away with if there were more competition for the dollars of Sun City Festival residents.

Delicious barbeque served with sass.  The best greens and mac and cheese I've had since moving to Phoenix!  The pies are also wonderful.  I'm a vegetarian, so I stick to the sides, but my friends really enjoy the meat here.

Yeesh, some of these reviewers make me embarrassed to be an avid Grouponer.  Here's a tip - if you are basing your eating out based on where you can get a steep discount, you probably aren't paying enough to deserve to be treated like royalty.  Yeah, Andy's a weirdo from New York who likes to tease.  I don't doubt that he's a bit overbearing and rude sometimes.  Bring a couple chill pills and enjoy your food.  Anywho, I've always gotten great food here.  Its a great place for lunch, but only if you aren't in a hurry.  The counter is a bit misleading, as your entree will probably get prepared fresh.  The food is much better quality than what you pay for it, but you gotta wait for it.    The sandwiches are the bright spot for me - I've had just about all of them, and they're all top-notch.  Creative flavor pairings.  Juicy, well-seasoned meats.  Decadent cheeses.  The sides are pretty good, too.  It's easy to figure out something if you're a veg, too, with more than just starches or cheese-drenched veggies on display.

Before I actually went here, I had visions of lady and the tramp in my head - dimly lit, small cages, howling, sad dogs.  The shelter is actually really wonderful, given the incredible and unfair demands placed upon it.  I volunteer, and we have to go through a 12-hour training process, after which we focus on "adoption counseling" - meaning we do our best to make sure that anyone interested in adopting is being paired off with a good match.  The professional staff does their best to take care of the animals, and really cares - it shows in the clean cages and the dogs that come in skin-and-bones and leave bulked up.  A wide variety of dogs come in - mostly pit bulls and mutts, but lots of german shepherds, occasionally boxers, lots of chihuahas - but in the five months I've been volunteering there, I've seen everything from pugs to bloodhounds to great danes.  Lots of cats, too.  Dogs cost anywhere from $80-$150 bucks, and cats all cost $25 (I'm pretty sure).  This includes spay/neutering and a coupon for the first round of shots.  Whether you are looking to volunteer or adopt, this is a great place to go!

for burritos, this place is great.  america's bean and cheese burrito features peruano beans, which are definitely tastier than your standard pinto.  pretty simple and straightforward, but well executed.  has the unfortunate tendency to fall apart, though, as the delicious beans soak through the delicious tortilla wrapper.  the carne asada here is super tasty.  obviously, anyone claiming the best carne asada in phoenix can expect a throwdown, but for people with gringo sensibilities, this is a pretty great version - not as crispy as some more traditional places, well-seasoned, and juicy, which is rare among carne asada purveyors.  i think the best way to experience it is in a burrito, but i know people who are big fans of the torta and the taco incarnations as well.  beer is cheap.  refresco margaritas are divine, getting better with each sip.  the patio is a really fun place to hang out.  there are a few knocks keeping this from five-star perfection.  quesadillas are a bit disappointing and boring given the quality of everything else.  there is a lack of salsa offered for your food. you get a cup of some fresh and tasty - but crushingly mild - stuff, with no options for spicier or more interesting fare.  all in all, a really solid neighborhood joint.

I have traveled far and wide across this great nation, and nowhere compares to Phoenix when it comes to cheap, fast, and delicious Mexican food.  The chile relleno burrito at Filiberto's is a case study in why.  A breaded and fried chile stuffed with cheese and drowned in guacamole and pico de gallo, wrapped in a warm, soft tortilla that tastes fresh off the stone - ignoring cholesterol and fat, what could be wrong with that?  Drown it down with a sweet cup of horchata, and you have entered post-drunk, pre-dreamland nirvana.  For meat lovers, the carne asada is yummy, but I think my favorite is the patròn burrito.  Also, Filly B's doesn't use lard in their beans, which makes it a go-to place for my vegan friends when hunger strikes at two in the morning.  If you want fine cuisine, go to the Barrio Cafe and be prepared to pay for it.  if you want delicious and equally authentic Mexican food, visit Filly's, any time.  There's a reason there's a line for breakfast burritos at five in the morning.  Also, a veteran's tip - avoid the drive-thru and go inside, if you can.  Even if you are ordering your food to go.  Trust me.  A Filiberto's drive-thru line is a place where time ceases to have meaning and the fourth dimension gets clogged.

there's more than bike-fixing going on here.  there's a real community of people from tempe who are into all sorts of rad things.  if you are the sort of person who feels like the phoenix-area has nothing cool going for it, spend a few nights hanging out here, and if your mind isn't changed, there's no hope for you.

We went here for my Bourgie Birthday Dinner: 2k11 Edition.  There's nothing worse than paying top-shelf prices for poorly executed food, and I'm happy to report that this place was great.  After a comical adventure exploring what seemed like the entire reservation, we had a meal to remember.  Wife was a bit worried by the steak-heavy menu, but those worries proved totally unfounded.  We split the crab dip, a house salad, a scallop dish, and the gnocchi.  Each dish was well-portioned, well-prepared, and expertly seasoned.  The scallops were seared just-so; the top crispy, the rest of the scallop slightly chewy and smooth.  The bed of greens they sat upon were a perfect contrast, and the accompanying potatoes mirrored the scallops: slightly crispy on the outside, smooth and melt-in-your-mouth on the inside.  Every few bites had a bit of cheese (gorgonzola?) that spiked the flavor-o-meter into head-explosion territory.  The gnocchi were also top-notch.  I can't lie - I dipped my finger in the bowl and licked some sauce long after the gnocchi were depleted.  Ditto for the crab dip, which wasn't heavy or gross or cheese-melty.  The house salad was also super good, though not very memorable in the face of everything else.  The complimentary black bean hummus: fantastic, as others noted.  Tasted fresh, not like it had been sitting in a vat.  Service and atmosphere were low-key but classy.  Appropriate for a resort.  Highly recommended.

Coming from a shrimping town, it has been painful for me to see the po' boy catch on as one of the latest trendy re-appropriations for the chic foodies who like to brag about their "new urban soul food."  I'm sure some of it is good, but there is something inherently wrong about $12 po' boy sliders.  Which are served on dinner rolls.  And feature lobster and sausage.  Fortunately, on a trip to the strip-mall labyrinth of the West Valley, I found this amazing, amazing place.  The po' boys are actually po' boys.  They make their own sauce, which is delicious.  Simple, fried seafood with lettuce on a chewy baguette.  I've had the shrimp and the oyster varieties, and both tasted crisp and fresh out of the fryer, and practically exploded in my chomper they were so good.  The potato salad is also creamy and delicious, with the subtle balance of sweetness and vinegar that I think is crucial to a good tater salad.  It's not just a bunch of boiled potatoes mashed up with mayonnaise, or some bulk monstrosity ordered from the grocery store.  It's worth waiting til a Thursday to try this place just to get the crab landry.  Good lord.  Sweet crab stew over delicious garlic bread, topped with four fried shrimp.  The dish doesn't look like anything other than two hunks of bread floating in brown sauce, but it will destroy you in the best possible way.  Best of all, the place is family owned and operated.  The restaurant is simple but not boring - one wall is painted purple and gold in celebration of LSU, and the other walls have a few pictures of other memories of Louisiana - but not in a stupid, kitschy way.  They also serve alligator now.  Worth the trip from Phoenix!  Really!

This place can't be beat in the downtown area in terms of creative, yummy food, relaxed atmosphere, and fair prices.  I've sampled about half of the menu, and while the red curried noodles and veggies wasn't really spicy enough for me, I've otherwise thoroughly enjoyed everything!  The gypsy stew is probably what comfort food tastes like in heaven.

5 stars for this place based on its location - in an airport.  Compared to anything else available at McCarran (and virtually any other airport, for that matter), this place really lives up to the adjective in its name.  You know you picked the right refueling station when you walk into the restaurant and smell the closest thing to ambrosia i can imagine - garlic and onions being freshly sauteed.  This is the best part of the place.  Everything tastes like it was cooked to order instead of assembled to order.  The tortillas are chewy and fresh tasting; spanish rice is deliciously seasoned.  There's a variety of interesting flavors - curry, cajun, lemon-garlic - and a wealth of vegetables - spinach, mushrooms, peppers, onions, tomatos.  Salsa bar gets the job done.  The only knock on this place is that it isn't open 24 hours.

Bad sign when the salsa tastes bad.  Not bad-boring, like, bad-bad.  Like there was something unpleasant in it.  We ordered an appetizer platter with a few different dips.  This wasn't bad-bad, just bad-bland.  By the time our entrees arrived, I wasn't too excited.  They were okay.  I had the mahi crisp, which is kind of like a tortilla pizza, I guess, and that was probably the best of the bunch.  Still, the described tamarind sauce didn't taste like tamarind, and the wasabi flavoring didn't have any bite.  Worst of our group was my wife's veggie torta - the vegetables were sparse and had a burnt aftertaste.  When I heard the place was "contemporary Mexican," I was hoping for something like Gallo Blanco's delicious interpretations of Mexican classics, but, overall, the place felt like an extremely expensive Taco Bell.  Attempts at "fusion" or "innovative" Mexican cuisine don't really work if the end result doesn't even slightly resemble authentic Mexican food - or doesn't even have a bold flavor at all, period.  I don't think there was a leaf of cilantro in our entire meal.  At these prices, the food should at least be notable enough to have a strong opinion about.  And, to add insult to injury, the service we got was terrible - when one of our friends asked if an appetizer would make a suitable entree, portion-wise, the waitress literally sneered at her - "I don't know how much you eat."

Hands down, this place has the best fish tacos to ever cross my lips when I was not within spitting distance of the ocean.  Grilled, fresh fish, with a really tasteful guacamole, sauce, and just the right amount of cabbage.  Tortas are pretty good, too - their vegetarian torta is actually good - stuffed to the brim with a variety of veggies, instead of the usual lechuga-aguacate-tomate nightmare.  GB's french fries, surprisingly, are incredible.  You get a big plate of fresh fries, with a delectable garlic aioli.  Aioli seems to be one of those things these days - like the panini a few years ago - where people try to pretend they are classy by throwing some garlic in some mayo and calling it aioli, but this aioli actually kicks.  Ditto for the quesadillas.  Perfection!  Horchata here is housemade (I believe), and isn't the sugar-water that so many of us love from Rancho or Filly B's - it's good, but if you want something sweet to swig, go for one of their smoothies, instead, which are fresh and delicious.

As everyone says, the food is really, really good.  I prefer the pizza here to Cibo - Cibo is great, but it can be cheese overload.  The veggies tasted really fresh, the bread is made on-site and was tasty and well-textured, and the beer selection is on-point.  I'm excited to go back when I don't have to scurry back to work.  I'm not going to mark it down for the bad service we got - but it was terrible.  In case the server is reading this, yes, we meant to give you a shitty tip.  That's what you get when you ignore a table for fifteen minutes before we have to call you to order, when you take our orders with an attitude as if we've worn out your patience simply by being present, and when you act like an all around douchebag.

This is a coffee roaster who provides beans to local coffee shops.  It is run by the affable Randall Denton, who used to be a barista and manager at the legendary Willow House.  Xanadu supplies a few local joints, like Sapna Cafe, and the coffee is delicious, and the rates are reasonable.  They also offer bags for the typical home coffee addict, and a subscription service.  I don't really know much about the bean process, so I'm going to stop myself here.  If you are a restauranteur looking for locally-roasted beans, or a coffee fiend who wants to support your local roaster, look this place up.

This is a Mexican seafood restaurant and grocery.  You can dine-in or buy fish to bring home and cook.  For those who are unschooled in the field of eating in combo fish-shop/restaurants, the place will smell faintly like fish.  Fair warning if you find the smell repugnant.  Also, if you're experience with Mexican seafood ends with the fish taco or Baja Fresh, be warned - this place is not quite what you are expecting.  I dropped in, lured by promises of $5.99 lunch specials, and was surprised at the prices on the menu - most items were in the double-digit range, and I was only looking for a quick, cheap lunch.  The menu is large and varied, with everything from beef to octopus fully represented.  As tempting as the more expensive entreés sounded, I diligently stuck to my budget, opting for the $5.99 shrimp burrito.  $5.99 isn't bargain-basement for a burrito, but for a flour tortilla stuffed with shrimp, a standard ensalada, and some flavorful rice with vegetables, I'll bite.  The shrimp was in a sauce that had hints of citrus and tomato, and another bright, tangy note that I couldn't quite place. The shrimp itself was excellently cooked, not soggy like poor-quality ceviche or overly-rubbery like poorly defrosted frozen camarones. In short, delicious.  The rice tasted like it was cooked in some kind of broth, and had tomatoes and carrots thrown in for good measure.  Also delicious.  The salad was the standard that you get in most Mexican places, but, importantly, the iceberg lettuce, green bell pepper, and tomato all tasted fresh.  No limp lettuce here.  The veggies provided a very satisfying crunch to the burrito and the rice.  They also served beer and liquor.

deeeeeeeelicious vegetarian/vegan food.  simply prepared with plenty of vegetables, not overloaded with gross gluten-y messiness.  super duper cheap.  this place is sort of like a vietnamese veggie house, but better.

seriously.  if this place were to move downtown, adopt a more quirky moniker (maybe bamboozled? or perhaps, mock the duck?) they could charge twice as much for half the portions.

Folks who work downtown, rejoice - there's a new option for a quick, delicious lunch that won't you leave you broke or gross-feeling.  For those who care, Mid City Kitchen was started in November by chef Michael DeMaria, whose other restaurants - like Heirloom - are out of my price range.  I was excited to eat at a lunch counter restaurant with lunch counter prices where the food was cooked up in the imagination of someone who normally catered to a different crowd.  Yes, this is a lunch counter.  There is a pizza station, a sandwich (hot or cold) station, and a fry station, plus soups and a salad bar.  The salad bar had a wide range of choices - not your usual sad mushrooms and old lettuce.  I can only vouch for the pizza and the french fries - both expertly executed and delicious.  Everything else looked really tasty, though.  Word of advice - don't go for the half pizza, unless you plan on getting a side.  The pizzas are definitely personal-sized, so half a pizza will leave you hungry.  Also, the place is tucked away in an office complex, in the smallest building, attached to the parking garage.  Parking is all on-the-street metered or in the garage, so it's really more of a place that's handy if you work in the area than one that's worth driving across town for.

I really try to find something positive to say about any locally owned place I eat, but this place was really, really bad.  i had the namesake sandwich.  the meat was served without sauce - dry and slightly tough.  adequately cooked, but bland - no flavor.  the bleu cheese slaw was soggy, and also relatively flavorless.  there was barely a hint of bleu cheese there - it is very hard to mask such an assertive flavor, but these guys seem to have done it completely.  after a bite or two to sample the meat sauceless, i thought i drenched the sandwich in sauce.  but aside from a slight dampness and a whisper of tomato, the sauce was barely there.  i ended up soaking every bite to try and get an idea for what the sauce tasted like, but i all i could get was a very, very mild, tomato-y thing.  this was the spicy sauce, mind you.  the sides i sampled seemed store-bought, especially the potato salad, which was more like hard-boiled egg salad with the occasional potato.  the roll was good.  but it was a waste of a good roll.  barbeque is about assertive, bold flavors - regardless of region.  notorious p.i.g. has completely failed on that front.  maybe they toned down their recipes for the general public?

I am pretty sure my friends and I stumbled into a coke party when we came here for a late bite after a house show back in the Neighborhood.  The lights were low, there were people dry humping each other wall-to-wall, and lots of frequent, quick trips in and out of the bathrooms by staff and guests alike.  All to a soundtrack of terrible techno.  All of this would've been worth a laugh if it weren't for the food.  We ordered a vegan pizza, a couple cheese slices, and an order of garlic knots.  The vegan pizza was a barely-cooked pie with hummus haphazardly smeared across it.  The worst part about it was the paprika - they had attempted to season the hummus, but for some reason, rather than sprinkling the spices across the entire pie, there were 5 distinct, huge mounds of paprika that spotted the pie like an outbreak of chickenpox.  The slices came out first, and were cold even before we reminded them that we ordered garlic knots - which took an unholy 20 mintues, after we reminded them.  To top it all off - the garlic knots, those of the epic cooking time, were completely cold and raw in the middle.  Eddie's pizza is like some bizarre circle of hell.

Defining things in the negative is dangerous, but in this case, a little negative-definition is necessary: TMI isn't a fake dive bar frequented by white kids pretending to be poor; it isn't a fake (insert European nationality here) pub; it isn't trying to serve over-priced small plates; it doesn't have super sexy low lighting or uncomfortable chairs.  It is a low-key house-turned bar that serves solid food executed extremely well, alongside beer and wine that has obviously been selected with care by fans of things that taste good.  The sandwiches here are really a reminder about how good a sandwich can be, flirting with the platonic ideal in sandwich-ness.  The mac n' cheese is just like mom made it, baked and crusty and rich.  The salads are simple and delicious.  Happy hour is really generous - $2.50 draught beers and $4 selected glasses of wine.  The tap beer selection is better than anywhere else in downtown Phoenix, excepting the Roosevelt, which is very un-hang-outable.  I've sipped three or four glasses of other people's wines, and the wine selection is really great as well.  Best of all, kind of like Casey Moore's in Tempe, the bar is starting to act as a great place to see the diversity of folks who live in the Coronado and Roosevelt neighborhoods.

Fresh, tasty Italian in a relaxed setting.  Fresh really is the operative word here.  I should bust out the thesaurus for some other substitutions, but I'm not going to.  Service was slow - I can see how it would annoy people in the other reviews.  But it wasn't incompetently slow, just kinda slow.  Like, you know, they were preparing the food fresh.  The portions were generous - I felt like I had a whole beach-worth of clam shells after finishing my pasta.  The pasta itself tasted fresh, as did the delightfully zesty, peppery red sauce.  The pizza was another fine entry to the crowded Phoenix fancy-pants pizza crowd - chewy, with a crispy, almost burnt crust.  The house-made mozzarella was wonderful, and the roasted veggies on top were just right.  Icing on the cake: a great wine list and fun nightly specials.

Alright, so there's no way I can get around to saying this without coming across like kind of a douche:  Jobot hits all the right notes, like a very good European coffee bar.  There's enough room to hang out, but not enough room to encourage the sprawl of a Lux-esque MacBook party.  You can still get some work done, but the space just isn't set up in a way that allows to abuse their hospitality by using the bar as your office.  It can also be a very social spot, with room at the bar to chat, or plenty of comfy furniture outside and in the adjoined extra room to relax,  but the baristas can all also pull a good shot of espresso (looking at you here, Fair Trade).  They've got toddy - tasty, cold-brewed coffee - which is a prerequisite of being a good coffee shop in Phoenix (or anywhere in the summer, really).  And the food?  The baked goods are tasty, but the crepes are fantastic, whether your craving the sweet or the savory.

Good sandwiches.    The rolls are dense; almost like potato bread.  Ingredients are cooked fresh to order, and the seasonings are zesty, for lack of a better word.  I don't think the banana on the jerk sandwich was good, but I'm almost never a fan of sweets on my savory sandwiches (that includes you, cranberry sauce trying to get all up on my turkey).  The sweet notes contrasted way too much with the spice; my taste buds were super confused.  This is more of a grab-it-to-go counter than a sit-down place; there's only bar seating, aside from some patio furniture that will probably be unsittable when the summer sun comes back.

Cambodian food, where have you been all my life?  I know, I know, Cambodia.  I love this place.  I've ordered about 6 dishes off the menu now, and everything has been perfectly portioned and cooked.  Having never eaten Cambodian before, the closest thing I can compare it to is Vietnamese: it is very light, tastefully seasoned, and is best when the ingredients are fresh.  Everything from the shrimp to the herbs at this place has tasted uber-fresh, and the service hasn't seemed any slower to me than I'd expect at a restaurant.  Maybe some people are confused because the prices are so cheap.  As for atmosphere, the place is really cute.  There's always Cambodian pop music playing (which is often re-worked American songs), and the staff is always very friendly.  Great for lunch or takeout.

A quick word to the wise - this place might be a stand on the side of the road, but the food takes awhile to prepare.  The freshness is well worth the wait, but if you are pressed for time, don't expect to order and walk away quickly.  When we approached the window of this fantastic little food stand, we must've looked puzzled, because a woman quickly gave us the rundown on the whole menu.  She told us her favorites, ordered for herself, and then told us, "This place is really good.  I should know, I'm from Venezuela and I love the way they cook here."  Emboldened, we walked away with two arepas.  We had actually had arepas before, in Brooklyn - they are kind of similar to the dish some parts of Mexico call a quesadilla.  Thick masa is formed into a pita-type shape, or sandwich-style, around delicious fillings.  I think these might've been even better than the ones in NYC.  The masa was crunchy and chewy all at once; the fillings were boldly seasoned and complex.  My favorite was the Reina Pepiada.  It was a chicken salad with peas, and it was the bee's knees.   I followed one of my cardinal rules for unfamiliar Spanish-language foods - if the title isn't a direct translation, its probably a regional favorite, and it was.  Very excited that there's cheap and delicious food easily accessible from either Fremont or the Strip.  Highly recommended.

this place has all the requisite pieces of a wonderful neighborhood coffee shop.  decent brew, baristas who know how to pull a good shot, yummy food and snacks, and a welcoming, peaceful environment.   if you want something sweet, try the french toasts - they will blow your mind.  ooey, gooey goodness in the form of homemade vanilla bourbon creme.  the savory stuff is good, too, from the burritos to the potatoes, and the lunch sandwiches are all pretty tasty.  i never would've thought we needed another coffee shop in downtown phoenix, but this place has its own character that makes it just as appealing as anywhere else.   yay!

So glad this place is in the neighborhood!  The sandwiches are generously sized and stuffed with freshly prepared ingredients - I watched everything go on the grill from my seat.  The southwestern influence melds really nicely with the classic grilled steak and cheese.  Kind of like a good steak torta from your favorite fast food joint, but with higher quality cuts (and vegetables, and bread, and sauce...). House made sauces and chewy, warm buns seal the deal - plus the fact that $10 gets you stuffed with a  sandwich, a drink and fries or onion rings.
