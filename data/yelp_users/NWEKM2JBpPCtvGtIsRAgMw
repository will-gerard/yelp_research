One of the best white pizzas I have ever had! I can't believe I waited so long to try this place out! I love the owners! So nice and funny. They hung out with us at our table and shot the shit for awhile. I've been meaning to go back but my only grip about this place is their hours. I usually don't get home from work in time to get here before closing! But I will have to make time and go back soon for this awesome local restaurant.

This place is just what I've been looking for in AZ- an amazing sandwich place!  I went to sacks for the first time yesterday and LOVED IT.  I built my own sandwich which is always a plus.  Im too picky to order sandwichs that are off the menu.  Huge sandwichs for a very reasonable price.  My sandwich was only 6 something.  I wouldve paid 10.  (Sacks, Please dont up your price because I said that)!  I will be frequenting here a lot more for lunch.  Plus the business man candy during the lunch hour is great too.  yaaaa buddy

I really like LGO. I go here very often as I have my monthly RD meetings here. I have only been for breakfast/lunch and would like to go to the pizzeria at night. I love the ambiance of this place. It's so cute and trendy and warm. Everything I have ate there so far has been amazing. The roasted chicken is soooooooo good. Things you have to get there- the english muffins and the sea salt chocolate chip cookie. I don't even like english muffins and LGO's are unbelievable. Don't even get me started on the cookie. I have to get it everytime I go. It is the BEST chocolate chip cookie in the world- and I've had many a chocolate chip cookie in my day. Make sure you specifically ask for the LGO sea salt cookie. One time one of my friends got the "healthy" Tammy cookie on accident and from what she said it was not good.

EVERYBODY raves about this place so I finally went with a friend last week.  I wish I hadn't heard so many good things prior to going because I was severely disapointed.   Service was AWFUL.  We came at 4 pm so we could get in abotu 3 glasses of wine before the $5 wine ended.  WRONG.  It took 30 minutes each time we ordered a glass of wine and I mean 30 minutes from the time we ordered it.  When we went to order the 2nd glass of wine it was 2 minutes after 5 and luckily since we complained we still got it for the $5 price.  The bruschetta also took an excessive amount of time to come and 2 of the cut pieces had fell of somewhere so we got jipped!  Let me say I once was a server for many years.  This place was not that busy and definetly not so busy that it takes 30 minutes to get a glass of wine.  Food was ok.  I didn't think the bruschetta was anything special like all my friends made it seem.  I liked the salmon pesto one, but thats about it.  I know this review sounds mean and since I have heard such great things I am willing to give this place another try.  I will order a panini and hopefully get quicker service.  If things are better I will be happy to revise my review- if not I will put Postino's in my OVERRATED category

I've been looking for a good BYOB place since moving here.  This place is pretty great.  The place feeled really authentic.  We didn't have to wait for a table.  I had the Alexandro and my date had spaghetti and meatballs.  Both were pretty good.  The cash only thing sucks but bringing your own wine really makes up for it.  I will definetly come here again!

I LOVE,LOVE, LOVE YC's.  I come from the midwest where we have HuHot's and its an all-you-can-eat, go up as many times as you want kinda place so I was a little weary when my friend said you only can go through once with your semi-small bowl.  Then she showed me the way with the packing papers and I must say I have become quite a pro at making monster stir-frys that last 2-3 meals worth.   I love YC's because: -Great selection of veggies, amazing selection of sauces and most are very low calorie.   -Extremely quick cooking time w/ friendly service -I love the whole grain options for noodles and brown rice. -I love that you get soup, wontons, rice, and drinks with your meal price.    Could improve with more protein selections, like seafood.  Not a big deal though.  I have gone here nearly once a week every since I first went here.  Its a great fast lunch place.  Every other mongolian grill place I've been to in the valley has not come close to comparing.

I've only been here once but this place is pretty legit for pizza. I like places with a lot of variety for pizza since I'm a total weirdo and refuse to eat tomato sauce. I had chicken pesto. I am usually a thin crust person but I forgot to ask for thin crust and was kinda glad that happened. The chicago style was super good. I will definetly try this place again. And bonus the beer is super cheap for a pitcher!

I was fortunate to have a good friend take me to this little gem of a place last Sunday.  When we arrived around 12 the place was packed with a decently long wait.  This didn't realy bother me because it likely meant that the place was legit.  I never see a chinese restaurant with a wait.  Also large asian population of patrons which is also a good sign.  This was only the second time I had experienced dim sum.  It was an awesome experience and everything I had was soooo good, even though most of what I put into my mouth I had no idea what I was eating.  Didn't care.  This place is fantastic and I can't wait to come back and try more things or even their takeout menu.  Most authentic chinese food I've found in AZ thus far.

One of my favorite pizza places! They use lots of cheese (which I love) and fresh ingredients. This place is special since I went on the first date with the bf there.  Luckily they had lots of white pizza options because that's the only type of pizza I eat otherwise we might not still be dating. But seriously its really good. Nice patio for when the weather is cooler. Romantical.

I have only gotten to try a little piece of Roaring Fork but what I did have, I liked a lot.  I went there for happy hour.  They had a lot of options for happy hour.  I had the chicken pesto flatbread which was good, but was kinda missing the pesto part- it could use some more.  I also had the lamb which was very good.  The mojitos were amazing.  There are so many good things on the menu.  I will definetly come back for dinner soon.

I frequent Zipps fairly often and I am definetly a fan.  No its not gourmet, super high quality food.  Its bar food people!  The burgers are great.  I know it sounds simple but their chicken fingers are the best.  Different from any others and the half onion ring/ half fry option with entrees makes me happy.  Plus they have some of the best specials and they last almost all night!  Theres only 1 hour in the evening that doesn't have specials (7-8).  I go here often with friends for beers, burgers, and sports. Loves it.

I'm not the biggest sushi fan, but I have to say that RA in old town is probably my favorite sushi place in the area.  The happy hour is great.  So many food items on it and you can't beat the sake bombs.  Ra'cklin shrimp is my fav appetizer.  I'm not too adventerous with my sushi but their shrimp tempura roll is my favorite out of all the sushi places I've been to.  Like it Like it Like it.

I had a great experience at Italian Grotto a couple weeks ago. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant. It feels very authentic. I love how most of the servers are older (maybe Italian?) men who aren't afraid to be a little loud and outlandish. Our server made great suggestions. The food was really good. I had halibut- piccata style. My boyfriend had shrimp parmesan which he said was also good. I haven't found very many legit Italian places in Phoenix so I'm glad I finally went here.

One of my favorite sports/beer/good food places.  This place is always busy.  I love the earthy atmosphere like you're in a massive cave.  All the food I have had there has been amazing.  The quesadillas are dangerously good.  I love cheese and they use lots of it.  The burgers and fries are great.  I love the beer sampler so you get to try all the brewery has to offer.

I moved here last December and so far this is my favorite pizza spot.  I had the thin crust (whole wheat) chicken pesto pizza and it was amazing!!  I love pesto.  And there have been a couple occasions where my friends and I have gone just for the pazooki's!! I have tried many of the warm cookie w/ ice cream desserts in the past but nothing else compares to Oregano's Pazooki!! One time my pizza came messed up and the staff was amazing about making up for it. Warning if you are in a hurry save Oregano's for another time because there pizzas do take a long time but are well worth it.

I know teppanaki can be kind of cheesy but I don't care.  I love teppanaki food!  The decor and atmosphere of this place is incredible.  Its very chic and sexy.   I personally loved the teppanaki food there.  My friends weren't crazy about it, but they aren't the ones rating it.   Drinks were expensive, but I'd like to go here for happy hour even though I hear its cougarville at that time.   I will definetly go back again!

Bungalow is one of my favorite places for happy hour.  They have good specials and I love the happy hour food.  That grilled cheese is gonna give me a heart attack soem day but its soooo good.  I've also come here for a nice lunch on the patio too.  Service is good, food is good, and drinks are usually stonger than average (I like extra strong drinks)

This is my second favorite Fox Concept restaurant so far.... (Ive tried most).  I went on a Tuesday night so it wasn't too packed- no waiting.  Server was very attentive, however may have been new because he was not very knowledgable when I asked about menu specifics.  Nearly everything we had was great!  Spinach and artichoke fondue was a yummier, classier version of the (usually) boring appetizer.  I love when places serve it with grilled flatbread rather than chips!  I ordered the chicken and pruiscuitto ravoli and it was very good!  I was very skeptical of the donut dessert before trying because I did not a want something greasy like a churro or funnel cake.  Fortunetly my assumptions were wrong!  It is truly amazing and unique!  The only disapointment was the side of Mac n' Cheese.  I love trying different macs at restaurants so I made my boyfriend order it for his side.  It was one of the most disapointing Macs I've ever had.  It tasted just like velvetta shells n' cheese.  Not what I expected at a Fox restaurant.  If it wasn't for the Mac I'd give this place 5 stars!  I will definetly be returning to The Greene House in the future

This is the best pizza place I have tried thus far in Phoenix. I love that it is located in a house. I couldn't decide between two of the pizzas and they let you do half and half! That really got me excited. I had the truffle pizza and another white one with spicy sausage. They both were amazing! I will be back shortly. Great place to take out of town guests.

My roommates go crazy over this pizza.  Maybe because they always eat it when they're hungover. I don't get it. No fresh ingredients. Nothing I hate more than canned vegetables on my pizza. BYE.

This is one of the most AMAZING seafood restaurants I've ever been to and I've been to a lot!  I am a seafood lover and was very pleasantly surprised at Wildfish.  I had the Chilean sea bass in a delicate garlic lemon butter sauce.  SOOOOO good-the best I've ever had by far.  The fish was cooked perfectly and the flavor of the sauce complimented it perfectly.  I also tried the scallops which were also seared perfectly.  The server was very knowledgeable and attentive.  The atmosphere is great.  I will definetly be returning.  There is so much more I want to try!

If you like super poor quality food but cheap and cheap drinks this is your place.  I don't hate on the cheap drinks but the food is terrible.  Id rather have Taco Bell (and I dont even like Taco Bell).  Definetly my least favorite place for happy hour- the place is small and crowded.  I dread when my friends want to meet here.  Much better places out there.

I stayed one night at Firesky and really loved it.  I was just looking for a one-night getaway with my boyfriend that was fun and affordable.  Firesky was all that and more.  Firesky has very updated decor and the rooms were very nice and spacious.  The grounds are beautiful with two pools and pond/waterfall/stream area.  I LOVE the cocktail hour where you can get free wine/maybe beer?  Not sure I only had wine but either way very nice beginning to the evening.  My boyfriend can't sleep without a mini fan blowing in his face and the hotel staff was amazing at finding us a fan.  I liked the "beach" pool.  I wish there wasn't so many children at the time but nothing you can do about that.  Overall I thought the place was very classy, modern, abd beautiful.  A great value for the price.  I would definetly refer all my friends and family who visit to stay there!

Sprinkles was the first cupcake bakery I've tried and will probably be the last.  Since the cupcake trend exploded I have tried many other cupcake bakeries challenging them to be better than Sprinkles, but most all have failed.  I love the variety of cupcakes and the mass amount of frosting.  I haven't had a cupcake yet that I don't like.  I have loved them all and they love my hips.  They are great for gifts and still are #1 in my mind for the best cupcake bakery.

I don't usually like writing reviews for big national chains but I had to write a nice review about this place after our experience.  I've been to CPK's many times and never had a pizza I didn't like.  This time I ordered the chicken pesto and LOVED it.  I also love pizza places that offer whole wheat and thin crust.  The crust was awesome and the pizza was probably my favorite out of all the pizzas I've had there. One of our pizzas got burnt so our pizzas were taking forever and I needed to get back to work.  The waitress came over an apologized several times.  When she came with the pizzas she told us that the pizzas were on the house because they took so long.  This was not expected as most places in my scottsdale area would just say "Sorry, deal with it."  The perks of going to a big chain I guess?  The manager also came over and apologized.  This was very generous of them.  I love you even more CPK, even if you are a chain.

AWFUL!!!  I was so excited today to go to Genghis Grill because I love DIY stirfry places; especially YC's!!!  I was so disapointed and disgusted by this place.   Reasons why this place did me wrong: - The try to make it too full-service restuaranty; not quick service like I want for my short lunch break -Thick, syrupy sauces full of sugar and carbs and fat as my ONLY choice for sauces. YUCK.  When I eat at a mongolian stirfry place I want something fresh and healthy.  NEWS FLASH to people who think they are eating healthy here: You just killed it with the sauces! -Very busy and very slow to get your food -Small bowls, nothing to use to compress your food to add more -Also I saw someone mention how "Genghis Grill doesn't make you pay for your to-go boxes like yc's"  I had to pay 9.99 for mine to-go.  $1 more than the normal price for staying there to eat.  Positive: -fresher meat and more variety of proteins  I will NEVER go back

This is in response to the condescending owner of Genghis Grill.  Unfortunely for you, I'm a bit more educated than your average diner.  I am a registered dietitian and I am smart enough to know the your comments on my initial review are misleading to your other customers.    First off, I have a 30 minute lunch break therefore I dont have time to drive to your restaurant and sit there for 45 minutes.  But I understand many people have 1 hour lunch breaks and they may have time for your restaurant.  This is why I chose YC's because I can get in and out of there on my time schedule.  Your goober sauces are more unhealthy than most sauces with the consistancy of water.  The only way sauces get that thick consistency is being made with excessive sugar and/or fat just like BBQ sauce and mayo.    Anyone who knows anything about nutrition and asian dishes should know that "Kung Pao" sauce is one of the most calorically dense sauces.  This goes for any asian restaurant not just YC's- along with other thick sauces like General Tso and Sweet & Sour.    I could really care less about these YC's recipes considering I always make my own as many people do.   I do not want a place that pre-makes the sauces for me.  Your comparison is clearly ridiculous considering the portion size you are comparing must be dramatically different.  YC's does not specify a serving size.  Neither do you!  Genghis Grill Serving Size = 0.5 ,1, or 2.  What does this mean????? g? oz? tsp? tbs? cup?  Not exactly what I'd call legitimate.     YC's charges .50 cents for a take-out box not $1.  I was charged 9.99 for lunch on a weekday for a to-go order.  So if your lunch is supposed to cost 8.99 well then you do the math.  You only solidified my decision to NEVER GO BACK with your rude response.  I have only ever rated a restaurant with 1 star twice.  I usually rate generously.  My initial review was my honest opinion.  I had nothing against Genhis Grill- it just wasn't for me.  Now that you have responded this way- I will now go to the extent to letting friends and coworkers about the situation.  I'm sure you will stay busy but I will not be visiting again.

This place is a joke.  Its the tinest little place.  The sushi was awful tasting and fell apart when you picked it up, so obviously not well made.  I do like the infused sake.  This place is a really good place for creepy old (or young) guys who want to gawk at the really hot staff.  Unfortunetly, I'm not a creepy old guy.

I am liking this place more and more everytime I go here.  I first went only for the sweets.  Their cupcakes are some of my favorites and its rare to find authentic macroons.  I finally went here for lunch and it was fantastic.  I got the chicken pesto sandwich and it was bomb.com.  I want to go here again for breakfast sometime.   Only downfall, it can get pretty busy and theres usually only one server.  Not a big deal

I have now had Red House 3 times and I think I can safely say that I have finally found a LEGIT chinese place in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  Everything I have had so far there is very good and very quality chinese.  I've had the szcheun shrimp, sesame chicken, and the triple delight.  All were amazing.  Their fried rice is so good.  It has this distinct flavor... I dont know what it is but its goooood.  It is a little more expensive than other quick-serve chinese places but its worth it!  Id rather pay more than eat this other garbage chinese places Ive been to in Scottsdale.  This will now be my go-to place for chinese takeout.

This place bothers me.  I already everything about country so going to these kind of places freaks me out.  I was forced to go here because the boyfriends parents were in town and they choose Cadillac Ranch due to their type of "cuisine". I have to say the foo d wasn't bad.  Server messed up my order but when they got it right it was ok.  I will not go here again however.  Sorry.

I went here for my birthday and holy moly was I glad I took a chance on NoRTH to make my bday fabulous.  This so far is my favorite Fox restaurant and one of my favs in all of the Phoenix area.  Everything we had there was excellent and cooked to perfection.   For apps: yucca chips and trio of dips AMAZING Entrees- Strazz-something chicken pasta, scallops, and New York.  AMAZING Desert- Nutella crepes- Not amazing but free since it was my bday! Service was excellent and they catered to our needs quickly and effectively.  We did not make a reservation for outside so when we decided we wanted to be outside they made the change and we were sat in 5 min.  Love this place.  Cant wait to get back and try more things!

What is it with AZ and their TERRIBLE chinese?!  I'm from small town midwest and our chinese was amazing.  This is a big city- wtf?!  Anyways, Oriental Garden "super" buffet was anything but super.  I know that buffets in general are hard to rate becuase of the lacking food quality but I've had some great chinese buffets in my day.  The options are limited and they didn't even have the favorites like sesame chicken, general tso, or beef and broccoli!  Instead they replaced it with weird, questionable entrees like cheese covered seafood mystery.  Even the crab legs were bad and had a funky taste.  I wouldn't pay $5 for this buffet so the $13 a person is unresonable for the quality of food.  I'm sorry I can't think of any pros.  Will someone please tell where I can find good chinese food in this city????!!

Love Love LOVE this place.  I am slightly disapointed to know it is a chain restaurant (we don't have J. Alexander's in the midwest) but it doesn't matter because the food is amazing!  I have been there twice and have enjoyed everything I have ate from the spinach queso dip (not ordinary spin dip), steak kabobs, the AMAZING Mac & Cheese (one of the best I've ever had and I'm a huge Mac fan), and of course the carrot cake...yummmm.  My boyfriend had the ribs and said they are some of the best he's had. The service is fine, nothing special, nothing bad though. Ambiance is nice and similar to many steakhouse type places. Food is amazing though and I will frequent this place often!

I wanted to find a place for my boyfriend and I that was modern and chic without being too "fine dining."  This place was the perfect pick!  I was a little worried after reading some of the mixed reviews but this place was amazing! The service was awesome!  Everyone was very attentive and the server was great with our special requests. The ambience was great.  Very modern and nice. The food was GREAT.  My boyfriend and I loved everything we got from the drinks to the desert.  The fresh berry drink was amazing and the bartender let us have vodka rather than gin in our drinks.  I got the scallops which were some of the largest scallops I've ever had.  They were cooked perfectly.  My boyfriend had the salmon with the shrimp risotto and loved it.  We also ordered a small side of the mac & cheese I had read about and it was one of the best I've had and I have had a lot of mac & cheeses!  Since it was our 4 year anniversary the server surprised up with a free dessert.  He brought us the devil's food cake.  We were so stuffed at this point but still had to try the dessert and it was also very delicious.  The marscapone push-pops were an amazing compliment to the dessert. The place was pretty dead for a Thursday night but most of downtown Phoenix is always dead!  I really loved this place and will definetly return!

This place is great for happy hour if you like margaritas.  I love the blue decor.  The cheese crisps are great.  Kind of a little older crowd though like late 30's-50's.  I prefer my 20 something places but all around good food and drinks.  I would go there again.

I didn't like the name and look of this place for some reason so it took me awhile to finally go here and I am mad at myself for not going sooner! I've been to Daily Dose for happy hour and breakfast and both were fabulous. Who has happy hour til 8 pm?!! Daily Dose does!! love the late happy hour and good drink specials. But the real thing that won me over about DD was the breakfast!  Best breakfast I have had in AZ for sure!  There were so many things I wanted to try and I can't wait to go back again!  I tried the turkey sausage, egg white omelet with toast and fruit; protein pancake; and sausage gravy & biscuits.  All of it was amazing.  I was thinking the protein pancakes would be like US Egg's but they are not.  They are very different but in a good way.   I really want to try the lunch as well. I have a feeling I will become a frequent guest at Daily Dose now.  Sorry I wasn't sooner.

I don't usually like to rate chain restaurants but Brio was pretty darn good.  The service was friendly and efficient.  The pasta dishes were very good with large poritons.  I really don't have anything bad to say about this place.  Everyone seems to be mentioning the happy hour.  I'll have to come back to try that!

I've only been to this place once and it was really great.  I just hada grilled cheese and tots which I know is pretty hard to mess up but still very delicious to me.  My boyfriend is obsessed with BBQ chicken pizza and even though they didn't have it on the menu the manager was nice enough to whip one up for him.  Great service. Good food. I dig the goldfish races too!

I have a special place for Clancy's in my heart because I am from NE and have been to the Clancy's in Omaha many times and I'm a huge Husker fan.  So ya, my review is a little biased.  I go to Clancy's pretty often during football season and its always packed.  Its a small bar/restaurant but the drinks are cheap and the food is good.  I've said it before, any place with tots is a friend of mine.  I've gotten burgers, wings, pizza, etc from there.  It has all been good, not amazing but good.  I'll continue to go there for the Husker season!

I'm originally from the midwest and for some reason we don't have places like this there.  Yogurtland was heaven for me.  I love making my own ice cream and love lots and lots of "stuff" in my ice cream.  I hated going to Coldstone and other places where they controlled how much was in my ice cream. Since I've lived here for awhile now I've experienced other places similar to this and sorry but Mojo's and Cherry on Top ain't got nothing on Yogurtland.  Mojo's sucks and is expensive.  Yogurtland is inexpensive and their frozen yogurt flavors are amazing!  And added bonus when I don't feel like being a fat child I can make a really yummy healthy treat from the low-fat/low-sugar yogurts and fruit.  LOVES IT

I hate to do this because the girl I had was so nice, but I had a really bad experience with R Salon.  I will keep the name anonymous because she's sweet. I got the groupon and wanted to get a haircut.  To use up more of the groupon I threw in a deep conditioning treatment.  That was a joke.  R Salon is one of those salons where hair stylists rent their own "chair" and use their own products.  Usually theres nothing wrong with this, but when I'm at a salon I expect that higher-end products will be used on my hair and not products I can buy from Wal-Mart.  This happened.  The "deep conditioning" treatment I got was a cheap Loreal conditioner you can find at any department store that probably costs $5 to buy at the store.  Not worth the $15 I was being charged to get this service! Little did I know the deep conditioning would be the least of my worries with this experience.  I have pretty long hair and I told the girl I don't like a lot of layering but now I have layers half-way up my head.  My hair feels thinned and looks scragly.   If the cut wasn't already bad enough... the styling YIKES!  I treat my hair like a baby and try to avoid straightening.  I have really straight hair naturally.  Every other hair stylist I have ever been to is skilled enough to just make my hair look great with a blow dryer and round brush.  This was not the case.  This girl raped my hair with the straighter!  I was clenching the seat as she was ripping through my hair carelessly and causing it to feel more damaged than before I got the cut.   I give this place 2 stars because the girl was sweet and seems to just need more experience otherwise this place would've hardly deserved 1 star. I learned my lesson.  No more groupons for hair.  I have never been more disapointed with a cut and treatment.  I will never go back again.  I will stick with my usual salon once my usual girl gets off maternity leave.

After having a bad experience over a year ago at R Salon, the owner reached out to me and apologized for the experience and assured me that if I gave R Salon another try that I would not be disappointed. Several months ago, Rick reached out to me again and asked if I would be willing to try R Salon again. The stylist I was going to at another salon had quit so I was without a stylist. I remembered Rick's kindness and willingness to make things right even after all this time and decided to give R Salon another try.  The salon had doubled in size since the last time I'd been there. The staff is very friendly. The feel of the salon is very comforting and inviting. My hair was in pretty rough shape and Rick suggested an amazing treatment which really helped mend my split ends back together.  The cut I got was amazing and just what I wanted. Rick was right about not being disappointed for a second time. The owner shows a lot of dedication to his clients and his business which is very admirable. I believe I just found my new regular hair salon!

I've only been here once and it was pretty enjoyable.  It was exactly what I wanted in a vietnamese restaurant- fairly skethy neighborhood, questionable things on the front counter, and lots of asian people!  All signs of a legit vietnamese place.  We got spring rolls for an appetizer and it was served traditional with the lettuce.  My date and I both got pho.  I got chicken and he got brisket.  Both were really good.  Not the best ever, but good.  Prices are so cheap!  Its hard to find good asian food in general in Phoenix, especially vietnamese so I was elated to be introduced to this place.

I am not a wing person and I am OBSESSED with the wings as Teakwoods!!!  The Jess Jess wings are unbelievable and I could eat 100!  They truly have the BEST wings I have ever had and my boyfriend agrees and he definetly has had a lot of wings in his lifetime.  The manager/maybe owner? is amazing.  He is so friendly everytime we go in there and takes the time to chat with us.  One time our wings were taking a really long time and he ended up giving us a really good deal which wasn't necessary but definetly appreciated.  Also they have tots for a side which is something I have an awkward obsession for too.

There were some things I really loved about this place and some things I was very disapointed about.  Luckily for them, the good outweighed the bad.    Good things:  AMAZING service.  We went there for Valentine's day and they worked with my boyfriend to get a special table and pre-set it up with flowers, card, etc (Embarassing, yes but very cute).  The server did a great job recommending wines. Ambience is wonderful.  I love the decor. For an appetizer we got the shrimp which was a huge appetizer and was pleasantly surprised, but filling.  I got the special surf & turf and the lobster was fantastic.  Very sweet and flavored perfectly.  Not one of those lobster you have to gorge in butter.  Bad things:  At a nice steakhouse you CANNOT get the steak cook temperature wrong and they got it WAY wrong.  I order medium-rare and my boyfriend orders medium.  Mine came out medium to medium well and my boyfriends was definetly well- no pink at all.  I'm not one of those annoying people that sends things back even though this time I was tempted.  Luckily the flavor of the strak was still very good.  The other bad thing was the dessert.  It was a joke.  We ordered the peanut butter one.  I can't believe a nice fox place wound serve melted peanutbutter and choclate in a jar with two small, dry peanut butter cookie sticks.  Worst dessert I've had in a long time.    I rate this place 4 stars because the service was some of the best I've ever had and did have some really good things.  I will try again and if the steaks do not turn out perfection next time, I will have to re-rate.

Shut down??! I have tried going twice in the past week. Both times they have been closed. There are now signs on the doors that Darque Tan put up that say "Former Bronze Boutique members come to Darque Tan for specials." I had been going to Bronze Boutique as a member for over 2 years and liked it a lot. I used to get Mani-Pedi's there too sometimes. Like Taylor D. had mentioned- they took the money out just last week with no notice of closing down. Real professional. If they do re-open I won't be returning.

I absolutely love this place and frequent here often.  Everything I have ate there has been good even though now most of the time I just fill up on the pretzels!  Happy hour is a lot of fun here and the staff isn't too bad to look at either.  I do agree that this is more of a drinks/appetizers kind fo place rather than a common dinner spot.  Really good drinks,  great atmosphere, and really friendly staff.

I frequent RnR quite a bit for happy hour.  I've been here tons of times since I moved to AZ.  Definetly one of the best happy hours in old town.  Happy hour from 4-7 LOVE IT (I get mad when places are 3-6- who gets off work that early??).  And pretty every drink is on special during happy hour.  Really cheap wine, beer, and liquor.   Ya their food isn't orgasm AMAZING but it's pretty good.  I've havn't disliked anything I've tried there.   I love the atmosphere and outdoor patio on both levels. I've been for breakfast too and the bottomless mimosas are wonderful.  They keep em coming.  The food is good breakfast food.   I take family/friends from out of town here for happy hours. I love this place I don't get what the hate is about!

I'm sorry to say this because I love Fox Concepts restaurants but Zinburger has been my biggest disapointment of the places I have dined since I moved here.  My boyfriend and I were looking for a great burger place for a date and my friend suggested this place.    For starters, our server was terrible!  I have been a server before and I understand that sometimes bad things happen at certain table throughout the night but wow girlfriend, serving is not for you.  The girl brought us a completely wrong meal the first time and forgot what we ordered.  When we waited for our actual meals to be brought out she still forgot the bacon on my burger and my boyfriends sweet potato fries.  MY boyfriend never got his requested sauces, no water refills, etc-disaster.  At the end the server ended up charging me for a Kobe burger (which I did not order and is more expensive) and did not apologize for any of the mistakes.  I ordered my burger medium and got it raw.  Trust me I like things a little on the rare side but this wasnt edible.  I ordered fresh mozzarella on my burger hoping for a nice thick creamy slice of cheese and I swear I got 1 slice of kraft singles.  The truffle fries were good.  Like I said before I love Fox Concepts and I usually dont rate places very bad but this place was not good and not what I was expecting.  I would have rather had a BK burger.

I am so desparate to find a good take-out chinese food place and this one just added to the list that failed me.  I ordered simple- things that aren't easy to screw up because I didn't want to be disapointed.  Chicken fried rice with extra egg & crab rangoons.  I made it very clear to the girl I wanted extra egg in my chicken fried rice several times, even paid extra for it.  When I got home I got rice and onions.  Not even the good onions (scallions) but massive chunks of white onion.  No chicken, hardly any egg, and no vegetables besides ONIONS.  Wtf?!!! How can you mess that up so bad?  I got crab rangoons with no sweet and sour sauce.  Like normal take-out places there were no utensils, no soy sauce, no nothing!  I hate to just rate a place simply on chicken fried rice but seriously.... get it together yummy yummy!

I am shocked by some of the bad reviews for this restaurant!!  I have been to Vatra twice now and have loved it both times.  I went for dinner once and Happy Hour- it has the potential to be a good happy hour spot.  The style and ambience of this place is amazing.  Seeing this place from the outside doesn't give it justice.  Inside the decor is chic and hip.  There are great views of Camelback mountain from the patio.  The patio should be hopping in the fall when it cools down. Everything I have ate there so far has been really good.  I love the shrimp and bacon pizza and the kabobs.  The smore dessert is fun and I love smores!  The drinks are amazing.  I really like the sunflower drink and the lemon basil martini.  And the best part the food is actually really cheap! Each time I went there I sat in the bar area and the bartenders are great.  Both times I went and it was the same two guys.  I think one of their names was Brandon... they were awesome and really friendly.  I can't speak for the servers as many people have given them bad reviews.   I am really hopeful for this place.  It is a great location and I think if they get their server kinks worked out then it will be an arcadia hot spot for dining. PS.  the price range given for this place is wrong definetly in the $$ range.  The food is surprisingly affordable.

I LOOOOOOOOVE ME SOME  SMASHBOXX!!!  Ya I know there are a lot of haters about these kind of places but Smashboxx will always have a special place in my heart.  You're either one of those bore "I only like dive bars" type people who hate it or you're like me who love to dance and get crazy and LOVE IT.  Almost everytime we are out in old town (which is a lot) we end up here.  In fact, I'll probably be here tonight.  Why?  House music, huge dance floor, usually good looking people, and of course the HOT BOXX!  I've noticed more recently the crowd is starting to get mildly more sketch but me and my friends will always love this place.  So many good times.  So many more to come.  wahhhwahhhaklxkljiuyrtmsuzlpth

First off, I would like to let all the haters know I am NOT an Arrogant Butcher employee or an employee of Fox Concepts.  That being said,  I went to AB last week and was pleasantly surprised.  I love downtown Phoenix and keep hoping it'll start getting more popular down there.  The ambience is great and love the decor.   Boyfriend had fish & chips which I know is hard to mess up but it was honestly the BEST fish & chips I've ever had (better than any I had in England).  I had the swordfish w/ barley.  The swordfish was cooked perfectly and I loved the tiny kick in the seasoning.  The entrees were wonderful, but the best part of the whole meal was the blueberry cheesecake!  It comes in a jar and is not ordinary cheesecake but AB's version is soooooo good.  I wanted another! Service was amazing and food came out in a timely manner.  I don't like when restaurants make their uniforms "unisex" because the poor girls always end up looking so manly.  Let the girls wear something a little more flattering!! I have been to several Fox places and I couldn't help but notice a lot of copy-catting from other menus.  My only wish for AB would be that they created more of their own entrees/appetizers.

So far the BEST vietnamese I've found in the States.  Thats saying a lot- even though I still need to hit up some more places in LA.  I was questionable of this place at first because the atmosphere is a little trendy and hip and our waiter was white.  When I find a really good vietnamese its usually in a sketchy place with waiters who barely speak english.  We got the spider spring rolls as suggested by the server which were AWESOME.  Then we both got pho- one chicken one beef.  The pho was some of the best I've ever had.  The broth had amazing flavor.  They had a special spicy "grandmas" sauce (which resembled the red pepper flake oil stuff you usually get a vietnamese places) but this spicy stuff was extra special and sooooo good.  I love spicy.  Its a little pricier than the typical vietnamese spot, but worth it.  Everything still tasted authentic regardless of the atmosphere.  Cant wait to go again!

Oh El Hefe... it has become one of our new spots to be at all the time.  Its not that the food or drinks are extraordinary but its just the place to be for the moment.  The atmosphere is a lot of fun.  The staff is really friendly and 80% of the time really attentive.  However, it is a very busy place at times so you gotta give them a break.  I've always had a great time here.  Beergaritas are a good deal.  Happy hour and sundayfundays are the best.

Finding a new place and person to do your hair in a new city is frustrating and you never know what you'll get.  Fortunetly I was referred to Mood Swings by a friend and I did not have to do any further searching.  I've lived here for almost a year and I have been going to Rachel for my hair ever since I was was first referred here.  The salon is very nice and I love Aveda products.  They dont try and oversell products or treatments.  Everything is very relaxing.  The salon has a trendy feel to it.  The prices are not bad and almost always there is some sort of deal/discount.  I would highly recommend this salon and Rachel!

I've been here for breakfast several times. I love how cute this place is! Great place to take mom! The stratta is fantastic and their baked goods have never disappointed and I'm picky about baked goods. The chocolate toffee muffin belongs in my belly everytime they have it there.

I was super excited when Majerle's had came to Old Town just blcoks away from my place.  Its a great place to walk to and get drinks or get some food.  I had never eaten at a Majerle's before it came here, but I heard good things.  They did not disapoint.  I have been there several times now and liked everything.  My favs are the buffalo chicken pizza and this one chicken sandwich with the sprouts and bacon... I forget what the name is.  Good atmosphere.  I am surprised it is not more busy.  Everytime I go there are always plenty of open tables.  I hope this place does well.  I will continue to go here.

So I used to be an loyal Yogurtland fan but Yogurtology has changed me.  This is now my #1 favorite yogurt place.  Their fro-yo is so good.  The flavors are amazing and a great variety.  Oatmeal cookie is my fave.  They have a huge variety of toppings.  Make sure you ask for additional toppings they keep refrigerated.  I almost missed out on the cheesecake pieces one time because they dont keep them out.   Downfall, its significantly more expensive than other places.  I would give it 5 stars if it were comparable to other places but its guranteed that I spend $5-6 here where I'd get the same amount for $2-3 at other places.  wah wahhh.  I will still go here almost everytime I am at fashion square however.  Which is a lot.

This is just a partial review because I can't comment on the food- just the wine and ambiance. I went to chick bar on a date for drinks. I really like that they do full and half glasses like they do in Europe.  I like being able to try a bunch of wines without having to have a full glass. Not enough places do this. Teh ambiance is great. The place is super cute. I'll def go back to try the food and update accordingly.
