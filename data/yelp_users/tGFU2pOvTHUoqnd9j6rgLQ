Hoo, boy..these are some good eats!  We stopped in for lunch to find a bustling crowd in a massive restaurant, though the attentive staff more than made up for the lunch rush.  We were seated quickly and had little trouble finding something on the seafood heavy, Cajun-inspired menu. Kicking off the meal was an order of the alligator bites: spiced, fried chunks of alligator with a zesty red sauce for dipping and a heap of crispy potato straws. The gator was cooked perfectly, neither mushy nor rubbery with a noticeable punch. Figuring it would be awhile before I saw alligator on a menu again, I went for the half po boy/gumbo lunch combo. The baguette was stuffed with fried alligator, lettuce, and pickles covered with tartar and cocktail sauces. Topped with a squeeze of lemon, it was hearty, delicious, and paired nicely with a cup of fiery andouille and seafood gumbo, packed with crab meat, sausage, shrimp, and that holy trinity of bell pepper, celery, and onions.  Worth the trek from lower Phoenix (or the suburbs).

This was home base for my trek out to Las Vegas.  The Hilton Grand Vacations Suites is a timeshare hotel, just barely detached from the Flamingo and only a block off the Strip. The suite itself is certainly not lacking in size: once entering the main door, there are separate doors to the living units on either side. Off to the right is the smaller of the two, a quite sizable hotel room complete with a king-size bed, sofabed, mini-fridge, microwave, whirlpool tub and bathroom with a glass-door shower. And there's even a bath-towel elephant waiting for you on your bed!  Off to the left is the much larger master suite: a full kitchen (graciously stocked with all manner of cooking utensils, a smaller living room with a surprisingly comfortable sofa bed, and a separate bedroom with king-size bed, flatscreen TV and hot tub.  The staff was helpful and courteous.

An offbeat bistro just north of Downtown Scottsdale that knows the key to good Asian fusion: mix the menu, not the dishes.  Tottie's offers large portions of hearty, and authentic, Asian cuisine that ranges from Chinese to Vietnamese to Thai to the owner's native Laotion.  We began the meal with an order of Vietnamese summer rolls, packed with shrimp, greens, mint, and a roasted pork that brought to mind char siu. The peanut dipping sauce added a pleasant touch. This was followed by a silky Panang curry, an on-point pad thai, and a ginger-basil salmon. There were no weak links, even if the Panang curry was a little muted and the pad thai noodles on the thinner side.  For the size of the dishes and quality of preparation, the meal was a good choice for a late lunch.

I wasn't about to leave Las Vegas without eating at at least ONE celebrity chef's restaurant, and BurGR was one of the less bank-breaking options.  We went in for lunch and, unsurprisingly, the line was quite long. BurGR takes the casual-dining concept of queuing (a short-distance pager) to a much more modern conclusion: they'll text you when your table is ready. After about ten minutes of wandering around the Planet Hollywood Casino where BurGR is housed, our table was ready and we were led inside.  The interior is classic American burger-bar: sleek metal, shiny white countertops, and the menus feature a flabbergasting Gordon Ramsey foldout.   The menu offers a wide range of burgers (and other non-burger offerings, but they are totally besides the point), from the traditional American (American cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion) to the Farm Burger (duck bacon, cheddar, fried egg) to the Euro Burger (goat cheese, truffle aioli, arugula, and an oven-roasted tomato). I went with the Euro Burger and it was certainly one of the best burgers I've had. Wonderfully savory, with each part of the burger complimenting the rest, while one ingredient could easily have over-powered the others. The side of truffle fries (hand cut fries covered with truffle salt and truffle-parmesan shavings, with a truffle aioli dipping sauce) were delicious to the point of addictive.  It's not a cheap meal, by any stretch, but you ARE on the Strip eating at a restaurant operated by Gordon Ramsay.

I've learned not to expect much from hotel eateries but Bluefire Grille still managed to disappoint.  Located at the Hilton Resort in Scottsdale, this alcove just off the main lobby suffers from a combination of overly ambitious menus and underwhelming service. Dinner, even at 7pm with just one other table seated, can be an ordeal. A harried looking waiter was pleasant, if distracted. The menu was scattered, covering salads to duck to fish.   An intriguing starter dubbed 'Scorpion Prawns' were described as U-10 prawns (big suckers) tempura coated and served with a chipotle cream cheese. The prawns were much smaller, but quite tasty. Looking for something lighter, I went with the duck salad: slices of duck on top mixed greens with sliced green apples, crumbled Gorgonzola, and candied pecans, all tossed in lemon-champagne dressing. A good mix of flavoura and textures, though the duck was just south of room temperature and verging on 'cool'.  Breakfast the next morning wasn't a much better experience, with a larger crowd leading to a few errors in service. An order of a pomegranate smoothie arrived at the table as a fruit oatmeal and grapefruit juice was forgotten. What did land at the table was, however, a satisfying meal to start the day.

You might not expect to find a hip, Hawaiian-fusion tiki bar next to the souvenir shops in Old Town, but you'll be very glad you stumbled in.  A small place with only a few tables and booths, Hula's Modern Tiki adds a bit of kitsch and a ton of flavour to a Hawaiian inspired menu.  Their white fish ceviche had a clean, crisp flavour, though the wonton chips served along side made scooping a bit of a challenge.  The entrees packed serious flavour, from the soy-and-pineapple infused shredded Luau pork to the kick of the 'Jawaiian Jerk Pork', served with a sweet johnnycake on the side. The fish, in particular, was super-fresh and bursting with flavour. The ahi, served seared and just rare, provided an excellent base for a macadamia crust and hot mango and papaya salsa.  Anyone looking for something new in Scottsdale should look into Hula's.

A truly excellent experience all-around.  This Scottsdale outpost of the upscale chain features soft lighting, a jazzy soundtrack, and phenomenal food and service.  A complimentary dish of local olives and almonds kicks off the meal, with a small, locally-sourced menu heavy on beef (with several chicken and fish options as well). No matter your choice, you will not be disappointed.  I ordered the skirt steak, the slices of marinated beef cooked to a perfect medium rare and accented by the bright flavor of fresh arugula and meaty heirloom tomatoes. A wine list contained some formidable selections, with a few craft beers added in. Just as a fine cabernet sauvignon can compliment a steak, so can a bottle of North Coast Old Rasputin imperial stout.  Dessert selections were just as well-prepared and ranged from an assortment of house-made ice creams, a banana cream pie, and a decadently rich devil's food cake.  While not flawless (the bread, much touted by the wait staff, arrived lukewarm and with just a dab of butter), it is as good a dining experience as you will find in Scottsdale.
