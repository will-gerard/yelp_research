This place is everything a dive bar/burger joint should be.  Open late with cheap beer and greasy burgers.  Not a fan of the chili they use for the fries though.  Service was super friendly, and the burgers are cooked where everyone can see...kinda good, since you would expect some iffy situations in the back if you couldn't see exactly what they were doing to your food. I'll be back, it'll be a guilty pleasure.

Oh Postino...how I love you. There's really nothing that needs to be said other than GO THERE! I've been nearly a dozen times now and I've literally never been let down.    I like to sit at the bar when I can, Sander is such a great bartender and always gets us everything we need before we have to ask.  We even mentioned we were waiting for a spot at the bar (it was a busy friday night) and he was nice enough to come get us when 2 people left.  We usually get the bruscetta, especially when they're on special (mon and tues), but if you want to branch out, try the pub board, or the butcher block.  Both are perfect for finger food while enjoying your wine and your company.  This is always where I go for special occasions or when I have out of town guests.  This place is definitely 5 stars.

Silky lattes, friendly service, and no corporate vibe.  Exactly what I look for in a coffee shop!  A friend turned me on to this little hole in the wall a few months ago, and every time we're in the area we swing in, me for a vanilla latte, she gets a mocha...it's hard to decide which is better, but I'm partial to my soy vanilla latte, so that always wins out...I do steal a few sips from her cup though...when she's not looking...

From the ambiance, to the staff, to the wine list, this place has got it figured out.  I LOVE wine, but I usually feel like I'm being tested when I go into wine bars.  This place is so unpretentious, it's a breath of fresh air.  If you don't know exactly what to ask for, the staff will ask you about what you've liked in the past, what flavor profiles you prefer, and a ton of other questions to narrow down exactly what you'll like.  3 times out of 3 they've nailed it on the head! They just recently added a happy hour menu and expanded their food menu as well...you have to try the smoked salmon bruschetta best I've had in the valley (even beats out postino's smoked salmon!) To top it off, this place even offers wine 101 classes, grape varietal classes, and even a book club!   I think you get it by now: This place rules.

I have to be honest, I never look forward to getting waxed, but at least when I do, I can enjoy the Lamar while I'm at it.  This place is great, it's exactly what a spa should be: clean, comfortable, and calming.    All the staff are super friendly and good at what they do...Ellen in particular, I always leave happy and satisfied when I get a wax or facial from her.    They frequently run specials too, which is nice, you just have to get on their mailing list.  If you're in the scottsdale area, be sure to book an appointment here.

Attended a few holiday events here.  They always seem to have everything so perfectly ironed out.  The staff is ridiculously friendly and helpful.  They just redid their whole outside pool area, which I'd love to try out some day.  They have live music and several dining and drinking options.  I def recommend this place!

Laid back, great beer, and a menu packed with variety for everyone. We sat on the outside patio and enjoyed lunch.  I got the portabella veggie beer bread since I had no idea what to expect from the name alone! Turns out, it is lots of veggies and LOTS (maybe too much) cheese rolled in a tasty beer bread wrap.  Very good, and of course, the french fries were awesome too.  Friendly service, even the chef came out to check on our table (he was yummy too!)  This was the first time I had been to this location, since I'm from Tempe and usually frequent the original.  It was clean and had normal brewery decor, but it's hard to beat the Tempe location with the actual beer brewing gear and old charming character.  Definitely check this place out if you're in the area.

What's better than smashing down frozen shaved meat and vegetables into a bowl to get every last ingredient packed in there to get the most of your money...? Nothing!  This place is a great lunch or dinner spot, and if you go easy on the wonton chips and frozen yogurt, it's actually quite healthy too.  My favorite part is watching people work their "techniques" on how to structurally build the tallest mountain of stir fry, and then somehow cover it in sauce.  I usually get a huge dinner and a full box of left overs for lunch the next day out of one large bowl...but I'm a mere amateur.  Hint: multiply the sauce recipe by at least 1.5 because some of the cooks let half of it run off the hotplate before they start stirring.  I usually just make an extra little dish of it on the side and pour it on after they've cooked my bowl.  YUM!

Locally owned by great people! Yummy lattes, and live music and game night! What more could you want?! This place really goes out of their way to offer more than the standard coffee experience.  When the owner found out it was our first time there, she went out of her way to tell us all about their nightly events, give us an extra punch on our first card, and make sure we knew about their specialty drinks. Considering they're in the same parking lot with a Starbucks, you know they have to be offering something special to stay in business.   Support the locals! Go to Gold Bar!!!

RIP OFF!!! I had a horrible experience with these clowns.  Went in to get a power steering pump replaced, and was soon called back because my part was "defective".    I was told it was the part, then it wasn't the part it was the rack, then it was the part AND the rack.  With a $218 bill for a car that still didn't work, I argued until I was blue in the face and got off without having to pay.  They guaranteed me that it would cost around $1500 to get a new rack and pump installed  LONG story very short: After going to a REAL mechanic, I learned the reservoir for the power steering fluid was clogged. $15 part.  I guess they were only off by about   $1485 DOLLARS!!!!  What a bunch of con artists. DO NOT GO HERE!!!

Orange Table is one of those places that you always wonder why you don't go there more often...did that make sense? In other words, Orange Table is definitely worth going to over and over again.    The menu is varied, but small enough to where they can make each dish perfect.  I got the tuna sandwich and even without a side dish, it filled me up and left me happy.  Their tuna salad has a lot more chunks than I am used to, I think it might have been jicama or something similar, but it was a nice change.  Their iced tea is apricot flavored, which I've never had before (and really liked), and their outdoor seating is inexpensive but homey.    With beach cruisers and leashed dogs in my peripherals, I sat and finished my sandwich thinking to myself that I would give this place 5 yelp stars...if not for the indifferent service. Come on people...a smile won't kill you...it's a beautiful day!  Other than that, great place, great food, laid back atmosphere.  Plus they serve breakfast and booze...my 2 favorite things. Give them a whirl.

I heart starbucks.   This Starbucks in particular is great because of a few things: 1. even though it's next to a busy road, they still have little grass hills that separate you from the real world when you're sitting outside 2. they have a giant parking lot and a drive thru.   3. they have a larger selection of retail stuff...and they always have stuff in the clearance basket too...yay me.  You probably know what a good Starbucks is.  This is just like that. :)

Oh four peaks, why do you always make me want to binge drink? This is a pretty cool neighborhood bar and brewery with decent food and and a nice patio.  They usually have random specials like shots of jager and long island iced teas...which brings us back to binge drinking. As long as you don't let the specials dictate what you're drinking that night, I think you'll be fine :) The appetizers are yummy, and it's always nice to support a local brewery, so give their brewskis a whirl. I've had hit and miss service, but overall I guess it was decent.  This is definitely a chill place to go, flip flops and shorts are the dress code.

I just love pita jungle.  It's one of those places you can count on.  The atmosphere is cool, the food is good (and everyone can find something they can eat - vegetarian, etc.), and they have really good green tea arnold palmers :)  I try to order something new every time I go to Pita Jungle, you can never go wrong with any of their items.  The falafel, the lentil and rice salad (i forget the name), the hot chicken pita, the fruit salad, the black bean burger...they're all so good!  Oh! And make sure to order the red pepper hummus as a starter with sliced cucumbers for dipping, along with the pita bread.  The forever changing art on the walls from different local artists adds character along with the tattooed staff (love it!).  The only thing I can think to change is the quality of the outdoor seating and the crappy strip mall location, but I guess that makes it a literal diamond in the rough!  See you soon pita jungle ;)

Well Hello Khai Hoan! You've been there all along and I never knew! Great Pho and spring rolls, pretty standard decor...no music.  Don't go for a first date, but go for your second, third, and fourth! Try the Pho with rare and well done beef...YUMMY!!!

Pablo Picasso Salad. Enough said. But I'll go on....  Oregano's is awesome on so many levels: portion size, price, staff friendliness, menu offerings, locations, decor, etc. etc. etc.  I've been to Oregano's more times than I can remember and I seldom have anything to moan about except maybe the wait time...and not being able to decide what I want ;)  If you haven't been there, go.  If you're there for lunch, grab a pablo picasso salad and a passion fruit iced tea.  If you're there for dinner make sure you try the bellinis, the pesto bruscetta, the thin crust pizza...and again, the pablo picasso salad!!!!    The music is fun, the decor is great, the staff is ALWAYS uber friendly.  The only gripes (other than what's mentioned above) is they should maybe invest in better silverware and outdoor furniture.  Other than that, keep doing what you do, Oregano's, and I'll keep adding to my waistline.

Tawni, Shaya, and the entire crew at Altered Ego, always make my visit FANTASTIC!  That's really all there is to say.  They're great at what they do, and you should go.  It's a full service salon with a coffee shop attached.  Just add a bar and a hotel and I'd never leave.

Extremely nice staff, in a really clean, modern, comfortable office.  I went in for a gum recession that was a little tender.  He took care of it and then sat with me and did online research for the best dental plan for my situation.  He's great! He also did my 2 front veneers. They've been going strong since 1998, and they really boosted my self confidence immensely!  Thanks Dr. Hatch!

Black n white latte and peanut butter cookies........I'm in heaven!!!!!!!!!  Walking into this place I was immediately impressed with the decor.  I love places that look cool without looking like they tried too hard.  I was actually concerned because places like this usually have baristas that think they're too good for you.  This place was different!  The cashier immediately sparked up a cute witty banter and suggested their house specialties.  We went with one vanilla latte (my standard) and a Black and White latte which mixes dark and white chocolate.  Both were really amazing.  Another cool aspect is their little in house bakery.  On your way down the hall to the restrooms, you can sneak a peak at where they smelt up their decadent baked goods.  It looks so fun! I wanted to ask her if she needed any help!   Well, at least I got to take part in eating the final product...Peanut Butter Cookies!!

I'd been waiting for the perfect time to experience Matt's.  This Wednesday morning I felt like that time had come.  I figured Wednesday at 11am shouldn't have much of a wait.  It didn't, and we were seated within 10-15 minutes.  The place is cute and the service is really great once you get seated (until then everyone looks kinda rushed and annoyed by you).    Our experience had it's high points: *Our extremely sweet server (love those glasses) *The ridiculously good coffee *and the novelty of eating in a shoe box.  I got the Hog and Chick with Bacon.  It was yummy, but...gasp....nothing to wait an hour and a half for like most people do on the weekends.  Yes the bacon was thick cut, and the preserves for the toast were lovely, but still, I actually had a hard time picking something off of the menu because nothing seemed to jump out at me as unique or unmissable.   One thing's for sure though, they do the classics well. For me, the above high points are enough to bring me back again, and hopefully next time the special will rock my socks off.    Matt and Ernie have a great group of concepts, thanks for bringing downtown up a notch.

Cute and affordable. Finally an alternative that I actually want to go to! Every time I try to break away from the corporate coffee chains, I get burned because their lattes taste like dirt, or they act like they've never heard of soy milk.  Come on people!    That's what I loved about this place, the staff actually knew what they were doing, and the menu included all the necessities, plus a few of their own creations!  Try the mint mocha...uh, YUM!  They make a great soy vanilla latte too.

Good and bad.  Tacos were great, and on HH (yay!) Beer was cold, and also on HH (double yay!).  Ambiance needs some work.  Really, if you just added a better sound system it would REALLY help.  Any time I walk into a place and it sounds an iPhone is playing the tunes, I always think "hmmm, what an easily fixed problem." Service was attentive and pleasant, and everyone seemed to be in good spirits. I hear their lettuce wraps are good, I'll try them next time (once I hear they've updated their music situation).

Well, what's not to love about a Wednesday night at a packed gay club? Great music, and drinks, but a word to the wise...when they say the drink special is buy one get one free, they mean buy this round and we'll give you chips for the second round, not order 4 and we'll charge you for 2. I would like to see a better dance floor there too, I kinda felt like I was dancing in the walkway, too close to the bar, or generally in peoples' way. If you want a sweaty, loud, eye-raped by the same sex kind of a party, then BS west is your place!

Omg, get in here. It'll change your life :) brunch w champagne, yes please.    When you set foot in this place on a busy weekend morning you get sucked into the spirit.  It's bustling and everyone is happy, and everyone is drooling over the food and baked goods coming out of the kitchen.  I can't believe it's taken me this long to get in here, I'll definitely be a regular from now on.  I ordered the Venice Beach burrito and it was sooooo tasty, we also decided to crack a bottle of champagne to celebrate the momentous occasion of experiencing this place.  The main room where you order at the counter has a staggering array of candy, gifts, baked goods, prepared meals, magazines, etc. etc. etc.  It'll take you a day just to look at it all.  Maybe next time I go back I can get my christmas shopping done while waiting in line.  The only things I would change about this place would be: I'd add table service and increase portions.  I'd also make the dining room feel a little more like the room where you order...it's just a little more inviting and comfortable.  Other than that, it was yummy and fun to eat here.  Great for a special occasion or a good place to bring out of town guests.

Although I've never eaten in the dining room, I am a regular at the bar, and have a great time every time!  The bartenders and cocktail waitresses are always so nice, and the band on weekends is super entertaining.  I always know I can come here and have a relaxing night out in a dimly lit atmosphere with good bar food.  Maybe I'll go there tonight :)

This place is soooo good! The food is finally something different from the normal bar fare you find at most places in this area.  If you've never had a pasty...stop reading this, get in your car, and drive to Cornish Pasty Co.  They have a gigantic menu with everything from veggie pasties, to indian and mexican pasties, and everything in between.  So far I've tried The Rosemary Chicken, The Pepper Steak, The Pesto Chicken, and The Mexican, I'd say The Rosemary Chicken was my favorite, but it really depends on what kind of mood you're in, there's really no way you can go wrong with any order...hey anything with that much butter in the crust could never be bad!!! ;)  The only thing I would change about this place is the happy hour.  A dollar off drinks doesn't really blow my skirt up.  Maybe some food specials???  Well, at least Irish Car Bombs are only 3 dollars all the time...but I don't always feel like forgetting the entire night...hmmm, guess I'll just pay full price for my experience...it's worth it!

Love this place! I only go about once a year, but when I'm feeling like fast food I wait it out here for the cheeseburger with grilled onions protein style with lots of fries and ketchup!!  The lines are sometimes overwhelming, but the staff has it under control and they move through the orders pretty quickly.  The hardest part about eating here is finding a table!

I guess I just don't give stripmall restaurants enough credit.  Noodles Ranch is fantastic.  I love Pho, and theirs is great.  The owner/chef even has his own cookbook available there for sale (that's a good sign!). The spring rolls are also delish, and the mango salad is worth a try if you're looking for something refreshing.

Why are you so far from my house!!!!!!!????  I love this place.  Great coffee, amazing pastries, and a really cute ambiance.  I can't wait to go when it's not a thousand degrees to enjoy their farmer's market area and possibly even sit outside (what a novel idea in Phoenix!). On second thought, it's probably better that you're so far from me...my butt would be huge if your cupcakes were any more convenient.

Iced coffee on a nice day out on the patio, or iced tea on a hot day in the cool AC.  So much better than going to a chain! Thanks Chad!  This place is always so welcoming when you walk in the door.  There are cool clusters of furniture and tables, a record player, and tons of books and games to peruse.    The cafe is connected to Alter Ego Salon, so it's the perfect way to spend an afternoon getting pampered and sipping yummy coffee drinks.  And you can also go splurge on Mexican food next door!

I want to start off by saying how great our service was here.  Unfortunately I can't remember the name of our server, but we were greeted and seated promptly and pleasantly, then given tasters of champagne and wine before deciding on a bottle.  She gave great suggestions on the food menu and kept us smiling throughout the whole meal.  Service is so often overlooked that it was nice to see someone in a good mood for once!  The food just made the experience even better.  I got the chicken sandwich and split the tangy turkey.  Both were amazing.  We also saw some of their stuffed burgers and vowed to return asap to try them!  The patio was relaxing and the price was reasonable too ($10 off bottles of wine on Mondays!)  All in all a wonderful place to go.  I'd say add some music on the patio though, or maybe turn it up? I just remember hearing everyone's conversations from across the patio!

Holy Amazing. I just tried this place for the first time...and I live about 2 blocks away...I feel a larger pants size coming in the near future. The 2 girls working were very friendly and attentive, and actually offered some suggestions, samples, and info about their frequent customer deal.   We ended up getting chocolate covered bananas, cheesecake, and bacon!  Yes, it was a splurge day.  All were good, but frozen bananas will always be my favorite.  I can't wait to try their coffee, I am a coffee fiend so I'm excited to have a local place so nearby.  The sample of the coffee ice cream was dangerously good.  I'm smiling just thinking about going there again. Thank you for opening such a cool place.

Although the atmosphere is great and the location is ideal, I won't be returning to Daily Dose.  Here's why:  1. I'm a huge eggs benedict fan.  After being assured by our waitress that their Hollandaise was tasty, I was sorely let down by the flavorless, overly yolky sauce.  Why is Hollandaise always such an oversite for brunch places???  2. The plate presentation was lackluster.  Although this isn't important if the food is great, I think it does make it seem even worse if you don't like the taste to begin with.  All I can say was that the side of fruit was literally 3 small pieces (one orange slice, one cantaloupe piece, and one pineapple piece.)  3. So the food wasn't outstanding, but at least we were having a good time talking amongst our table and drinking our delicious green iced tea, that is....until they decided to use the table RIGHT NEXT to us for their server side work.  Look, I'm a server too, and I know it sucks to roll silverware...but good god, don't do it right next to the customers.  These employees were tossing the silverware around after polishing it, and it was SO LOUD.  Not to mention the fact that the staff chose this same table as the meeting/gossip table too.  Side work should be done in the back of the house.  End of story.  We left when we couldn't take the sounds of clanging silverware and employee rumors anymore.  Our server Courtney was pleasant, the iced tea was really good, and the atmosphere was really cool, but these factors just didn't make up for the faults.

For the second go around (I had to go back to meet up with some people who chose this location before I could object), I gave Daily Dose a clean slate.  I went in expecting nothing and that's about what I was given...again.  Believe it or not, the staff was rolling silverware again in the same area as my first visit. Unbelievable.  At least this time there was a seat available outside...far away from the clanking.  The service: Since I am a server, I don't bash other servers' "styles", but let's just say, our service was weird, not bad, just weird. Lingering stares, awkward silences, you get the picture.  Also, I have been serving for a long time and I still write stuff down.  No, I don't think you're cool if you can remember everything a table orders.  Just guarantee my food gets there the way I ordered it.  This particular time my salad came out loaded with raw onions, which I very clearly asked to be omitted. (I'll let you guess if she was writing it down).  The food: I am ironically thankful for the fact that the onions were left on my salad.  Because if they weren't there, I would have had a plate of flavorless lettuce and feta cheese.  Come on people.  I tried a difficult breakfast dish the first time I went, so I figured I'd order a common Mediterranean salad, just to give them a "sure thing" attempt.  Wrong. Yuck. Was there even dressing on that?  I'm gonna stop here before I continue beating a dead horse.

One of the best lattes I've ever had in one of the cutest settings!  I never really get over to this part of town, but knowing this place is here may change that!  We walked here after lunch and fell in love with the little cottage.  The prices are fantastic, 3 of us for $6.75? That's unheard of!  The only reason this doesn't get a 5 star rating is because the barista was not too friendly... I'm willing to do another review though...hopefully next time I get a smile out of him! Thanks guys!

I needed a place that was quiet and clean for a quick overnight in the area.  This place was perfect.   The staff was extremely helpful and accommodated me with the quietest, most remote room in the hotel. The shower was awesome (good pressure, shower head, and plenty of steamy hot water), and the bed was uber comfy. I would have appreciated a small continental breakfast for the price, but at least they offered a really nice breakfast for around $10.

Once we found this place (I think we did 3 u-turns), we were happy with what was at the end of the treasure hunt.  This little coffee house is adorable.  It's got a boutique in the same space, it has a groovy selection of furniture, lots of floor to ceiling windows, and a friendly staff...Not to mention my new favorite drink! I'm always a sucker for my vanilla soy lattes, but this place makes a honey vanilla latte that makes my knees weak.  Such a small addition, such a big impact.  All I can say is, please invest in a sign.  If I had less determination I would have gone somewhere else, or assumed you were out of business.

Prosecco for $5. Nothing better for a Sunday!  We came upon this place while trying to walk off a heavy brunch at The Breakfast Club.  We walked in expecting to find a tiny space, but instead the place just kept opening up into new rooms, and finally out onto a huge patio!  Even though the space was huge, they still managed to keep it cozy somehow.  We opted to sit outside since it was one of the few great weather days in PHX.    Our server was soooo nice and attentive.  He new we were only getting a couple of glasses of prosecco, but he still let us know about specials for the next time we came back.  He made a great recommendation for the bubbles, and kept our waters filled the whole time.  He was attentive, but without being obtrusive.  All the other employees said hello and thank you as well, which I always appreciate.  I'll definitely be returning to 5th and Wine for more of the bubbly, and to try their wonderful looking menu.

Perfect patio for a Saturday!  This place walks a fine line between being too snooty and being just plain awesome.  I've had a couple of experiences here, and overall the food is really tasty.  I'm a fan of the gnocchi, even though it's a little different than traditional gnocchi. The location is great, as long as there isn't a douche bag convention going on, and as long as the bartenders and servers keep their positive attitudes, I think this place will be around for a while. Thanks!

The most unique place I've been in a long time.  This is a place that downtown Phoenix has been longing for!  From the airstream to the boxing ring to the fresh squeezed juices, this place will leave you smiling and satisfied.    We stopped in for brunch on a Friday after a quick Yelp search of the area.  I live for breakfast food, so when I walked in and fell in love with the decor, I was crossing my fingers that the food was equally as impressive.  Oh it was!  I had the asparagus, mushroom, and goat cheese scramble and fresh squeezed orange juice.  Well worth the wait, since we ordered right after a group of marathon runners!  The owner, Steve, came by to see how everything was, and we couldn't stop eating long enough to answer without a mouthful :)  He's a great guy and is genuinely interested in your experience.  We'll be back to The Duce frequently for brunch...and, of course, to try out their milkshakes, pies, lunch, dinner, farmer's market, gift shop, cocktails, and live entertainment!!!

A couple things: Our bartender was prompt, knowledgeable, and attentive. hooray. We had HH beers, which were nice and cold. The atmosphere is new and clean, kind of a standard new-style pub/bar And now to the music.  I must be the only one who is totally turned off by a silent restaurant/bar because SO MANY in the valley have overlooked this aspect of ambiance.  Please turn the music up.  I don't want to hear what the chefs are talking about.  Other than that, not bad.  Rating is on beer and service only since we didnt eat

This is the perfect place to go for a leisurely brunch or lunch with friends.  I've heard some people say "that's where chicks go" ...well, I'd say cheers to that, I guess we have good taste :)    This place offers some really great menu items for health conscious people, which I really appreciate.  Sometimes I don't want to go to breakfast because it's just too fattening, but this place makes delicious meals that don't force you to go to the gym right after.  Great coffees, teas, and breakfast cocktails are a great added offering, plus the baked goods are perfect for a little indulgence. (hey, if you save calories during the meal, you can afford to split a pastry!! ...yes, I'm a horrible dieter.)  Every dish I've tried here so far has been wonderful, I really don't think you can go wrong with your order.  Make sure to check this place out.

How can you not have a great time here.  People paid to make you laugh, and booze.  A match made in heaven.  Add great service and a convenient location (in downtown's CityScape right off the lightrail) and you've got yourself a 5 star rating. The menu could have a few healthier options, and the cocktails could be a tad cheaper, but all in all we had an awesome date night, and we plan to go back...frequently.

Oh Ncounter.  I was so excited. Why oh why was my food so cold and flavorless.  I live within biking distance to Mill, so I was thrilled to see a new cool spot was opening up.  I was picturing cruising to Ncounter to grab a coffee and an omelet and going about my merry way. Sadly, this fantasy will not come to fruition.  Understandably, the place has only been open a week.  I know how hard it can be to work out the opening kinks, I've been in service for going on a hundred years now, so if I happen to go back, I'll be happy to reevaluate.  But honestly, this isn't the first restaurant you've opened...so why the subpar food???  I can only speak about the food I tried, so here it goes: I ordered a latte and the Greek omelet.  I was pleasantly surprised by the latte.  I get soy milk, and often places somehow manage to make it taste like wood pulp, but here they got it right! Hooray, they passed the first test!  On to the omelet.  Yuck.  I don't know what the story was with this thing.  First off, cold. Secondly, raw white onions are just not my cup of tea.  I expected them to be sauteed and possibly seasoned.  But no.  Just raw, cold white onions.  Add cold artichokes, tomatoes, and a mere hint of feta cheese, and there you have the greek omelet.  I would have hoped for some sort of seasoning...I don't even think there was salt and pepper. :( My boyfriend got the Ncounter omelet and an americano.  Unfortunately, his were both strikes.  The americano barely tasted like espresso.  I'm not quite sure if their barista knows what they're doing.  And his omelet? wow...the presentation itself was...well...gross.  Take a look at the accompanying pics...I think cottage cheese and hollandaise sauce should be put in cups...otherwise it looks like a big, multi-colored splat.  No, the taste wasn't there either.  The hollandaise was lackluster, and that was really all that you could taste.  Damn.  I love hollandaise, I was hoping for a really indulgent, amazing, gluttony inducing, goop.  But no again.  The service was pretty good.  You could tell the cashier's were sick of the same questions, but I know how that goes.  At least they were smiling through their frustration.  I'd like to end this review by saying this: throughout writing this, I have decided to go back in a month or so.  I hope all the kinks are worked out, the cooks find their groove, and the barista gets the hang of it all.  I really would like my fantasy of a weekend brunch on the patio after a little bike ride to come true............    A five star review is in the works...I just feel it!!!

Best soy lattes in the valley.  I don't know how they make them so silky smooth, but they are l-o-v-e-l-y.  Service is always very friendly, and of course the building is awesome.  Parking is a bit of a pain when they're busy, but no big thing.  Glad to see they have almond milk too, I'll try that next time.

Horrible customer service. I was literally hung up on while trying to get pricing for my clients. Avoid this printer at all costs. They do not understand customer service, I am extremely angry and offended.

My favorite fast food burger in the valley.  Yes, InNOut is also good, but the amount of toppings you can get here is what I'm really after.  Plus, the meat is just more flavorful.  They are open late and always greet you with a smile...even if you waltz in 10 minutes before they close. Cheeseburger, all the way, minus mayo, plus jalapenos.
