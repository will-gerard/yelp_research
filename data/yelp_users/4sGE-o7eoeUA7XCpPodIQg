Don't live here, but was interested as my boyfriend and I were driving by. Decided to head to the office to receive a little information about the place and we were immediately treated with disrespect from a woman named Melinda. Asked if we could even afford the place and seemed less than interested in selling the it to us. That's fine, I'm sure there are other places willing to treat potential renters with more courtesy than this place does. Can't imagine what actual renters have to experience..

Great flavor and options! A little pricey but awesome for the summer :) Glad to have froyo down in this area.

So glad this place opened up so close to where I live! I came here because my cousin mentioned it to me and can't believe how many times I drove past it without even noticing. Definitely one of those place that you "don't judge a book by its cover". The inside decor is beautifully set up.   Sushi is really good, love the fact they have a brown rice option that I can't get that at other places. The eel cucumber roll was pretty good for a light roll that will will not fill you up too much so, I think I might go for the eel avocado though next time I come. Also I'm pretty sure I fell in love the gyoza and the light dipping sauce that they have. Seriously it was cooked perfectly.  Will definitely come back again!
