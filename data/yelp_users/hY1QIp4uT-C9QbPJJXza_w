Super clean venue! Always remember to go early to get your food before the start of the game, a few minutes before the half and possibly towards the end!   The wife and I grabbed some custom jerseys as we! I'm pretty sure we've adopted the suns as our new nba team

Been a fan of TJ's since my first visit back in ABQ. This place is more than just a grocery store, you can find great deals on fresh flowers, laundry detergent and stuff for your four legged friends!   I usually stock up on regional beer and coffee and the wife likes getting her spices, chips and cookies as well.   This location was quaint and very clean! Smaller than the one back in ABQ but everything we wanted or needed was here as well.

So upon arrival I was sorta hoping for a good place to stay but compared to other places I've stayed, this place is completely lackluster   I noticed on my way to the room that the gym was incredibly tiny and only had 3 stationary stations and not even a good pair of dumbbells, not to mention the broom closet gym had no door handle at all!   Passing where I'm guessing the breakfast is going to be it's small and uninviting. And not to mention I think the night crew left their pizza box on the counter...   And to add insult to injury the room we had reserved wasn't the one we were expecting. We needed two beds and ended up getting stuck in a room with bed and a pull out...   So to compensate they offered to give us 10k points to make up for it... I guess thats ok?   For staying only the night I guess it's ok but I wish it was a little better

Amazing! This is the first WH I've been too outside of NM and it was just as good if not better! I usually get the all star special with coffee and a pecan waffle.   Finally bought the mug too! Only 3 bucks!

This place is amazing! And you can't beat the prices either!   Get the Swedish Meatballs!

So I LOVE Beer! But this place (which I've never been to) is now the Mecca for beer. Not only is their beer menu 5 pages long it's categorized by: Type, size and ABV   I tend to err on the side of super dark stouts and IPA's so tonight I had the Dogfish 60min IPA and Odell Mercenary IPA.   Both were amazing! The Odell was strong, like an IPA should be - granted it was surprisingly light in color but definitely my favorite at 9% ABV   I paired it with the BBQ Cheddar Burger which was cooked to perfection (Medium-Well.) It came with a garlic aolie spread and rum BBQ sauce, which was tangy and sweet.   My wife had the lobster and shrimp pasta which was equally as good!   From now on if I'm ever in a town that has a Yardhouse, I will be giving them my business-no questions asked!

This was an amazing complex! And being able to sit on the grass made the experience that much more memorable!   The pizza is amazing! And the footling hotdogs are even better!   Like most sporting events everyone usually leaves early to avoid traffic so that's usually the way to go so your not stuck in hellish traffic!   I hope my cities new ball park will be a percentage of how cool this one is
