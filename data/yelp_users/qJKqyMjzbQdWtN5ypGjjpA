Yesterday had one of our desktops bootup to the "Blue Screen of Death" so took the system over to Scott's shop. Scott understood how important this system was to our business and immediately went to work repairing the system. At 7:00 pm he called telling me that it was done.

In the mood for great pizza or Italian? Then check out Qorris. Dave's famous lasagna is my favorite.
