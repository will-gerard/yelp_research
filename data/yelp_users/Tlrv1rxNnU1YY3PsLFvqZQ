I'm a huge fan of this place. Great service, great Korean dishes at very generous portions. I really just enjoy the regular-styled Bulgogi (thinly sliced beef served in a hot stone plate with caramelized onions). Also really like the bipbimbap (veggies, ground meat, and rice in a hot stone plate). Bring that out with an unlimited supply of kimchi and we're good to go!

I decided to book a room at the Westin Kierland because I was attending the 9th annual Phoenix Cooks event at the hotel. We had a great little staycation here! Loved the relaxing atmosphere--I only wish we had more time to spend at the resort.  Decent rooms with extra comfy beds. Very helpful and friendly staff members. Lots of activities to take part in throughout the day. Convenient location.  I'll definitely try to plan another staycation here soon.

What's a working girl gotta do to get her morning Cup o' Joe? I'm talking about just a regular cup of drip coffee--I don't need anything fancy in the mornings (although, I do enjoy my espresso-based drinks as well, don't get me wrong here).  Well, this place has got it! From light-roasts, to dark-roasts, to decaf, to toddies.  Pros: Local, nice variety of coffees and drinks, upbeat environment, yummy pastries, pretty decent food, nice staff, and quick service  Cons: I'm not a huge fan of their espresso-based drinks (lattes, mochas, etc.), unfortunately. Coffees and pastries (most specifically the blueberry scones) are the highlight of this shop for me.  My recommendation: I usually get a regular drip coffee with a splash of almond milk and a shot of the caramel syrup in my cup. The combo always goes well with the medium-dark roast that they prepare for the day! On a particularly hot day (which is most days in AZ), I'll get the iced-toddy (espresso beans brewed in cold water). I think I might like Cartel Coffee Lab's iced toddy better, but this does the trick!  Also, I think they do make a good iced chai/dirty chai as well. I like them here, and I don't usually prefer chai lattes when I go to coffee shops.  Overall, I wouldn't drive out of my way JUST to try the food/coffee here. But, if you're in the area, Village Coffee Roastery is definitely a great place to stop by to grab a snack and re-fill your coffee cup for the day.

Love love love!  Haven't had a pasty I didn't like from this place!  Pros: -Great/friendly staff -Lots of good options to explore on the menu (including vegetarian options) -Nice variety of beers and decent  happy hour specials -Fun/down-to-earth feel  Cons: -You essentially seat yourself, which can get tricky if you're going with a large group. The staff is usually accommodating, though, and will try to find space to fit your entire party. -I don't believe you can really "customize" your pasty (i.e. switching the type of meats)  My favorite is the Royale with Cheese. Get it with the both homemade BBQ sauce AND the thousand island sauce. It's basically a cheeseburger in pasty form and it's oh so good. Another favorite is the Pilgrim--sweet potatoes, chicken/turkey, and you HAVE to get it with the side of cranberry sauce. Delicious.

The Parlor has easily become one of my favorite pizza places to visit in the valley.   Pros: As mentioned by other fellow reviewers, the ambience is just perfect - a great place to bring a date! With all hype about the Funghi pizza, I knew I had to try it out myself. If you're a mushroom lover, this pizza is perfect you. The goat cheese and truffle oil perfectly balance the sweetly seasoned mushrooms.   If you're a meat lover, I'd also recommend the Salsiccia. The flavors blended together so nicely, and the sausages had just the right amount of sweet vs. savory. Also, the fact that our waitress was super nice and helpful was a definite plus.  Cons: I don't have much to complain about here. We did try the Tiramisu for dessert, and though it was decent, I don't think I would order it again. The pizzas were the highlight of the meal.  Overall, you should definitely give this place a try! I had a very enjoyable experience here.

Love Pomegranate Cafe! My favorite meal has to be the elephant curry bowl, so full of wonderful flavors and textures. Don't even get me started on the drinks and desserts! I pretty much can never leave the shop without my cowgirl cookie and the rocket fuel protein smoothie...they are perfection. In fact, every dessert and smoothie I've had here has been absolutely delicious. My only con would be the prices. I have a hard time NOT indulging here, so a full meal can make a bit of a dent in my purse. The quality and service here does make it worthwhile, though.

Truly, I've experienced better.  As other Yelpers have noted, I am sure this place has improved quite a bit since it first opened. What I found most off-putting from my first couple of visits, though, was the service! I sincerely value good service, and good service wasn't what my friends and I received at Republic Ramen.  To play devil's advocate, I usually do go to Republic Ramen with rather large groups of friends. I can see how this can get to be overwhelming, with 15+ hungry adults placing orders and demanding food right away. I just felt like some of the staff could have been nicer/less rude/more attentive?  The food was also...okay. I didn't think they were particularly memorable dishes in any way. Same goes for the boba tea shop next door (which is part of the same restaurant, I believe).  I might give Republic Ramen another shot--this is one of the closer ramen shops in my area, so I definitely want to give it anther go. I do hope the experience is more enjoyable this time around.

There's definitely a reason why Thailand is named "The Land of Smiles" :) What a fun and lively place. Service here is wonderful! I work very close to Soi 4, so you can imagine...I eat lunch here quite often. Our second time to the restaurant, all the servers recognized me and my co-worker the moment we stepped into the restaurant. Since then, we've been treated like family/friends every time we visit!  Pros: Great ambiance, GREAT service, fun lunch and happy hour specials  Cons: I do think their dishes are a tad bit Americanized. I'm South East Asian-American myself and grew up on some pretty authentic Thai dishes. Nonetheless, the dishes are still pretty satisfying.  What I recommend: Definitely get the Pad Kee Mao (it's a Thai basil and pepper stir fry with wide/flat rice noodles + your choice of protein). This is probably their best dish on the menu, and certainly my favorite. If you're familiar with other Thai restaurants around town, the Pad Kee Mao is most similar to the Drunken Noodle dishes in most other Thai shops. If you like a full-flavored dish, make sure to try this one!  I've also had their Pineapple Fried Rice with chicken, their Tom Yum soup, and their Red Curry. All were good, but none popped out like the Pad Kee Mao did.  Can't wait to go back!  P.S. if you work in the same business complex, make sure to let the servers know before you pay! I think you get 5-10% off the bill. :)

Perhaps we just went on a bad night? Ordered the wrong things off of the Late Night menu?  I was SO excited to check this place out, especially after reading the many great reviews on the food and service here. I'm sad to report that our experience lacked the luster that I was so looking forward to. :(  Off of the Late Night menu we ordered the ribs, wings, and hummus & tzatziki. The ribs had nice texture, but there was no flavor to it at all! Same with the wings. It literally tasted like the wings had been sitting on the counter the whole day, and someone just threw a bunch of extra sauce on top of the wings before serving it to us. Not pleasant to eat at all.  The hummus & tzatziki, though? Very good.   What really disappointed me about this meal is that it seemed as though our server KNEW that the food was going to turn out pretty badly. He asked us if the food we ordered was enough for us, but never asked if we were enjoying the meal. When I proceeded to let him know that I thought the food was "okay" his response was...and I quote..."yeah, but is it ENOUGH?" I didn't think it was a very polite or appropriate response.  It also didn't help that he got our order wrong...twice. He even asked us to repeat our order three times, and he still brought out the wrong dish. Maybe he was trying to discreetly tell us that we didn't choose good dishes?  Regardless, I'm not going to go out of my way to try this place again. Perhaps if I'm in the area, I'll give the real menu (and not the Late Night menu) a go, but at this point, I'm not entirely sure it would be worth it.  If you do decide to try this place, hope your experience is better than mine!

Yum! My favorites here have to be the classic flavors, especially strawberry. We love coming here for dessert after grabbing dinner in the area. It's such a treat! Churn is a small little shop and without a doubt will always have a line of customers out front if you're there on a weekend. No worries, though! The line goes by fast and the wait is worth it. Good old classic ice cream cones never get old!

Very fun, upbeat place to hang out with a group of friends!  I've actually had a couple of friends perform at Crescent Ballroom, and hear that most other performers/shows end up being pretty entertaining as well.  Service and food were so-so, but didn't take away from the overall experience. Looking forward to my next visit here!

I joined OTF Awhatukee about 5 months ago and have only positive things to say about this gym. Amanda, the manager of the Awhatukee OTF is such a hard worker. She genuinely cares about your health and progress, and is always super helpful. Mark is the head coach at this gym - I absolutely love his workouts! He's always energetic and continuously pushes you to the next level. I get my tush kicked every time I sign up for one of his classes. The best thing about all of the trainers at this specific OTF is that if you communicate your personal/fitness goals with them, they'll do whatever it takes to help you achieve those goals! I feel like I'm a part of a huge new family, and that's a great feeling to have.  The only con that I'll mention here is that the workout schedule doesn't always fit my work schedule. My job sometimes takes me out of town for a few days at a time, so I'm not able to fit in all of my sessions for the month (so I end up losing the sessions I signed up for, unfortunately).  Overall, I'd definitely recommend this gym. Whether you're an athlete training for a marathon, or just someone looking to get in shape, this gym is a great place to meet others who are working towards the same goal. Try out a week for free and see for yourself!

What a fantastic place!  The first time I visited Snoh was last month, and I have been craving another visit since! There really aren't any words to describe this delicious treat - it's literally just like flavored snow melting in your mouth.  My favorite is the green tea flavored snoh. Sometimes,  green tea flavored things can leave a bitter aftertaste, but this was perfectly balanced. The tea flavor was noticeable yet it didn't overwhelm the other flavors. I added fresh strawberries and red bean as toppings, and drizzled condensed milk and chocolate over the entire thing. It was a great combo! I've also tried the same combination but with almond pudding instead of strawberries - also good, but I like that the strawberries added texture to the snoh.  Pros: fresh ingredients (I believe they do get fresh ingredients everyday, and they actually shave the snoh right in front of you. This snoh does not come out of a packaged machine,  thank goodness)!  The ambience is another plus. This place gives off a very hip and fun vibe. It's a great place to just lounge around with friends on a hot summer day.   Cons: I can see why this place could be a bit overwhelming for some people, especially if he/she isn't familiar to the concept of shaved and flavored ice. My advice? Just go for it! Pick flavors and toppings that are familiar to you, and just ask the guys who are making the snoh for their tips and advice.   This place is certainly worth the drive,  and I can't wait to make another visit soon.

Fun times at the 9th Annual Phoenix Cooks! event. :)  I thought the venue was great, and extra points that the event benefited the Phoenix Children's Hospital (an organization very dear to my heart)!  There was a variety of wine and beer samplings (though, I do wish they had a wider Cabernet selection...I think there were only 2 stands that served Cabernet, and by the time I found them they were already all out).  Fleming's Steakhouse had a very nice prime rib sample, and I really enjoyed Mastro's lobster mashed potato cup! Hyatt's mini chocolate/caramel tarts...mm mm good. Overall, a very fun experience with friends and fellow food enthusiasts.

Love the bulgogi hot stone plate here! Rice, vegetables, and bbq beef over a sizzling stone plate, you really can't go wrong with that combo! The side dishes are great as well, especially the kimchi. We always get very sweet servers as well--very good service.

Excellent owner and staff in addition to great food! We ordered a pressed juice and it was a perfect blend of orange, carrot, ginger, and banana. The owner, Marcus, also gave us samples of some of the side dishes that he had available - you guys, so good! I especially liked the kale salad side. It was flavorful with a citrusy dressing and just the right amount of texture and crunch. The walnut pesto pasta salad was also great, but I prefer the crunchy texture of the kale. We also got "the gooey" sandwich, which is essentially an Italian styled pressed sandwich - super flavorful and loaded up with lots of salami, mozzarella and pesto. Finally, we couldn't leave without having one of the fresh pastries. Some pastries are made in-house and some are brought in from local bakeries in town. The cinnamon roll was pretty epic!   I'm just ecstatic that we've found such a great little local shop just around the corner from our house. I also love that Graz supports the other local businesses in town by offering their products at the shop (I.e. the pastries from local bakeries and also coffee from Peixoto *swoon*). So many of my favorite local places rolled up into one!  Will be back certainly for the pastries, absolutely for the food and juices, but most especially for the great service and people who run the shop.
