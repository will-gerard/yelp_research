To better judge this review, you need to know a bit about me.  I like ice cream. I really like good ice cream.  I don't really like cones.  Waffle cones haven't really been my thing.  Now to the review.  I really really like Dave & Andy's ice cream.  Their coconut might have been the best ice cream I've had and their thai ice tea was sweet and delicious as well.  In spite of my distaste for them, I was talked into a waffle cone.  It might have been the best decision I made all night!  They make them fresh daily and drop an m&m on the bottom to make sure your ice cream doesn't leak out.  Either I need to change my outlook on waffle cones or Dave & Andy's are truly special.    Go check them out for ice cream and don't forgot the waffle cone!

This review is for their bubble tea only...  First, they offer to types: Black or Green.  They also offer Milk Tea along with the standard Tea.  The drinks are prepared quickly and I enjoyed the Lychee Black Tea very much.  At $3.50 for 16 ounces, the price ain't all that bad either.  So, if I were to find myself in Squirrel Hill again, I'd return for another Tea, and probably give their food a shot too!

While the sushi selection at Chaya looked great, we decided to try a few other items instead.  We sampled a handful of apps, including their egg custard, various pickles, and soft shell crab.  The custard was solid, the soft shell crab was accompanied by an awesome dipping sauce, and the pickled vegetables were great!  We also went with the beef udon dinner entree.  Yes, it seemed a bit odd that it comes with pieces of fried chicken, but wow that's some unique fried chicken.  By the time we got to the udon, we were both approaching full, yet the first taste ensured we both made room to enjoy.

If you are looking for a quiet place to enjoy a standard drink, Hofbrauhaus is NOT the place for you.  I mean this place gets loud!  You'll quickly see the crowd standing on their seats, singing and dancing along to the music and enjoying Hof's home brew.  Their lager is good, but I think I prefer their dunkel!  Remember, your choice is 1/2 or full liter, so come prepared to drink!

Most yogurt places don't stick out in my mind.  From the outside, this Razzy Fresh didn't appear to be any different.  However, I was happy to see a more fruit-full flavor selection.  Beyond the selection, quality of those flavors were superior to others as well.  I really enjoyed the Passion Fruit and would recommend getting yourself at least a little bit of it to try for yourself...

Spent the week here with my brother, who rents one of their 3-bedroom luxury apartments.  No complains about the living arrangement.  They seem to be in line with expectations for what he is paying.  Also, the general amenities are decent - grills and an outdoor pool.  It is a shame they never seem to clean the pool, because it is set up rather nicely.  Overall, I'd certainly consider renting here if I ever decent to move out west.

We were out in AZ for my brother's graduation, which meant he got to pick the place to celebrate.  He recommended Culinary Dropout for our large group (2 other families celebrating with us).  The cliff notes version is he chose wisely.  We sampled nearly all the apps.  The deviled eggs were simple, but probably my favorite.  We split the grilled cheese sliders as well.  A few of us enjoyed the special kale salad they had, while the rest went large with the either the pub burger or pastrami.  The salads came in good portions and were full of flavor.  Those going with the sandwiches didn't leave anything on their plates.  Of course, we also enjoyed a few drinks.  Some seemed a bit pricy, but they came quick and it was a day to celebrate.  I tried the After School Special beer cocktail and was happy with my choice.  Once the meal was complete, a few of us stuck around to play some games and enjoy the atmosphere.  I could see myself frequenting this place if I lived in the area.  Therefore, from a tourist perspective, I say go for a visit.

My experience with Firefly has taught me that shopping on price alone is not the way to go.  As if Airline Fees aren't bad enough, Firefly seems to have managed to bring them into the rental car business.  I agree with others who post about their inflexibility.  They spent more time trying to up sell me than actually focusing on helping me.  And that was after the ridiculous wait thanks to being light staffed on check-in/return.  Just skip'em.
