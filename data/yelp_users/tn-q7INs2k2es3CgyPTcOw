This is hands down the worst company i have ever dealt with. Highly advised to STAY away from here no matter what! The lady that answers the phone Brooke is beyond rude. They were suppose to fix cushions for my couch and were 45 mins late to get them and never even called. I had to call them to see if they were still coming. Then they said they would be done and have them back the next day at 4pm. I called to confirm and Brooke told me she never committed to a time and that it was a guesstimate of when they would be done. I told her that was not acceptable as I was under the impression from what she told me was going to be done overnight. Not to mention they never even called to say it was going to not be done and they needed another day. Brooke then told me she would gladly send back the cushions unfinished and hung up the phone one me. If you are looking for a nightmare and headache and an incomplete job go for it..... I'm still waiting for Pete the manger to call me back. They clearly get an F for customer service.

A good friend refered me to this restaurant as we were on a Taco shop kick for the month. i had no idea tacos could be so amazing. The salsa bar is out of this world.

Had drinks and apps at this location. Check came for 3 of us with 19 large beers. Told the staff and 3 different managers that it was incorrect and they threatened to call the police. The police had been in house an hour prior for the same reason. They apparently checked the cameras and came back and took off 3 beers, Not willing to admit they over charged us for the number of beers on our check.  Completely disgusted with the level of CS when dealing the management. They completely abused us as customers and made us feel like cheating them. It's concerning they would treat their patrons in this manner.
