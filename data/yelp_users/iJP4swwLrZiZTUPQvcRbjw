WARNING....THEY ARE SALESPEOPLE.....WARNING.......DON'T BE FOOLED My grandparents had polices through them and when my grandmother was found dead, by me, I had her taken to the closest facility, not them. My grandfather 88 years old has gotten nothing but grief from them and has been unable to get the money returned from her policy. They refuse to give them a refund to him. Don't use them, they scam the elderly people out of money...

My husband and I went there due to an infected wound on his hand. The staff from the receptionist to the doctor were prompt, courteous and attentive. Will return there if the need arises in the future.

Today I had a pedicure and even took my daughter for her first ever pedicure. Best pedicure I have ever had, the staff was so friendly and the prices were very reasonable. I will return again very soon.
