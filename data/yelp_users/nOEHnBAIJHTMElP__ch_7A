The reason i chose fastmed was because I had signed up for the discount program about 6 weeks ago for another issue. My first experience was great no issues, I was in and out with resolution. This time I had a completely different experience one that was so upsetting I will no longer give my business to you. In fact I would really like to get a refund for my office visit of $100. I went in on Wednesday and found out I had swimmers ear the discharge notes stated if it got worse that I should contact your office. I called 3 times on Thursday all through the day. I was told your office was busy. I hadn't heard from anyone by 8PM so I drove to your office to see if I could talk with the doctor and see if I could see if the pain i was experiencing was normal. I had pain radiating into my jaw and was really uncomfortable and the drops I was given the day before seemed to irritate my ear more than help. Not only that but my ear was so swollen I couldn't get the drops in. When I pulled into the parking lot it was like a ghost town. Only the staff cars were parked there, I went in and let the receptionist know I had called left a few messages and hadn't got a call back. I told the receptionist that I was in a lot of pain and that I wanted the doctor (Paula Conolly MD was who was there) to take a look at my ear and see what they suggested for the progression. I was told that they wouldn't see me unless I paid another $100. Why would I do that? You didn't fix it the first time intact the medication you gave irritated it more?!? She tells me to have a seat in the waiting room and she would go speak with the doctor. Then comes back and tells me the doctor will be up to speak with me shortly and that they can't really give me pain meds. Side note I know there have been some issues with prescription drug pain medication abuse however to imply that I am there to get pain medication when all I wanted was a second opinion and maybe some stronger medication to knock out whatever infection I have is insulting and very upsetting. I wait for almost 30 minutes for a prescription for a Z Pak. Mind you I am the ONLY patient in the office! The receptionist comes out with my prescription for the Z pak and tells me the doctor can't see me. Oh and that if I have any other problems I should call back on Tuesday's and Wednesday's because thats when the original PA I saw is in the office. Its when I week and I am still in disbelief of my experience. Terrible health care treatment.

This is a great store lots of treasures to be had. Staff is always great and pleasant to work with I am a consigner and a buyer and I look forward to coming in and see what new stuff is hitting the floor! These girls work fast too if I bring something over the weekend it's usually on the floor in days. I consign with other shops too and I get my best checks from this store. It always seems to be busy. Roxanne is awesome! She is knowledgeable and always helpful! I often ask her to critique my stuff and let me know what things sell best! I want my items to sell and so do they. so just try to make sure you items are as presentable as possible because it goes on the floor fast. Also compared to other consignment shops they take ALOT of my stuff! If I bring in 100 pieces other shops may take 12 item where they will take 82 and most of them will sell!
