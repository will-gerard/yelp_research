Both Patti Hastings and Dr. Dairiki are amazing.  My first visit was very informative and fun for a first time mom-to-be.  I wasn't one of the lucky women as I lost my pregnancy at 8 weeks.  I wanted to write this review complimenting their professionalism, sympathy and sense of urgency in this matter.   I found out on Wednesday that I lost my pregnancy and Dr. Dairiki was able to perform my D and C on that Friday.  She was extremely helpful in my post-op appointment and understood my emotional reaction.  She and I spoke and she recommended I see counselor as most women do not take the time to grieve their loss.   I took her advise and am doing great!  I can't wail to conceive again to make visiting her office more frequent.

I've been here twice. Both experiences were nice as I was able to sit inside by the bar once and outside at twilight my second visit. The service was prompt and food was tasty. I lot of people think Mexican right away but this is more of a New Mexico built menu, hence the recipes use a lot of green chili. Drinks are always nice if you choose to partake. I recommend any of their margaritas--always yummy! I would not recommend Carlsbad to to large parties as their space wouldn't accompany such a group.

Alright folks....I can say I don't give two stars unless they 'earned' them.   I will have to say this is the first time I have had the opportunity to experience what I once considered one of the best steak houses in the country. I will have to say I was extremely let down. :(   I have been a server at some of the top notch places around. Of course you are going to think, "well, she used to be a server, so she is going to rate a bit more harsh..." Not so much from this little lady. I always appreciate how great most servers are....not judge them based on tiny mistakes are mistimings. Okay, with that said here goes...   Food was amazing....(if you are on a diet, head straight for the veggie platter) If this was solely based on food, five stars! Thank you to the chefs and kitchen staff!   Service.....horrible. I was celebrating my boyfriend's business partner's retirement party. I will have to say that our table was a 14 top, however 4 of the group were 11, 5, 4, and 3 years of age. The tab was also prepaid by the retiree's boss. Large table +prepaid tab+kids+auto gratuity=horrible service. This doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out.  I had two glasses of wine and a glass of desert wine. I will have to say without a stopwatch in tow or in use, I will easily say it took her more than 15 minutes to hit the service bar to grab my glass of wine. This server had more than enough assistance and the bar was DEAD. I would totally understand if the service bar was behind or I ordered some really strange drink that required a special ingredient that the bartender had to go and get, but I was ordering 'by the glass' wine that was FEATURED on the menu. My second complaint about the service is that when a customer or 'guest' orders a glass of Pinot Noir, you don't automatically assume they want the most expensive glass on the menu. Prepaid or not, I know what I like and if the wine menu is MIA then when I say Pinot Noir chose a glass middle of the road. If I want $14 a glass Pinor Noir I will call it by name. This was NOT Victoria's fault. This was done by a gentleman that was of first assistance.   Service cont....Soups and Salads were not ordered properly and put in the wrong positions at the table. Sides were also not placed on the table in front of the person that ordered that item to compliment their entree. My boyfriend's steak was medium as opposed to mid-rare. This is easily fixed by asking for a re-fire but at the time, it was extremely tasty, and at that point in service, why interrupt.   Service cont...I was basically done with dessert by the time Victoria was able to bring my glass of dessert wine. I ordered a glass of dessert wine that compliments chocolate. Too bad I had to stare at my chocolate until my glass of wine arrived. She pulled the whole, my help was running around here trying to figure out where it belonged. Yeah, I wasn't born yesterday....she forgot to order it.   Okay, enough with the service. The ambiance was impeccable. We had our own, private dining area. Dinner service started at six and we finished up around 9. We had very young children at the table that were incredibly well behaved. I had just met his daughter and her three small children. They didn't act up what so ever. I appreciate being placed in a private dining area. Major thumbs up to mgmt and everyone involved in making it a special evening.   The management was actively involved in service as they checked on our table at least three times and offered if they could assist in any way. Had the service not been so mistimed and sloppy I could have easily scored Ruth's Chris at five stars.   I am more than excited to come back and try again as everyone has bad nights and can be a little off.

Thank you fellow Yelpers! I was in real need of help for some lower pain stemming from a boating accident 10 years ago. I received very good physical therapy for a year after wards. Of course, your body changes over time and problems can arise.   With your reviews and a google search I made an appointment on Tuesday and they got me in on Wednesday. Everyone was very nice and knew my name and remembered what brought me in. My treatment was started with a series of x-rays because of my issue. The x-ray technician was hilarious and we went over my x-rays as he took them. I am one of those people that ask a million questions like a curious three year old--he didn't mind at all and answered everything thoroughly. We had a great conversation as he performed all the needed tests on my spine and back muscles.   Next I spoke with the Doctor and she was a small blond that was so sweet. She was very understanding to my every need and was very thorough with her preliminary exam. She then put me in the physical therapy room for some muscle exercises and heat treatment. After finishing up with the loosening up of my frame we went into the adjustment room. The same doctor who must have weighed 30 lbs less than me, talked to me during the adjustment explaining in detail what she was doing. This kept me calm as I heard some cracking noises (NORMAL) that I'd never heard before. I was very comfortable and relaxed during my entire visit.   Most medical offices always feel rushed and treat you like a number. A.C.C. is amazing in the fact that I never felt rushed, didn't have to wait more than a few mins to be seen and has an amazing staff that take pride in their employer. This is a rarity these days.   I would recommend this place to everyone!

Dr. Bachenheimer is amazing. She is very knowledgeable and attends medical conferences regularly to stay 'in the know' with advances in the field. She is very personable and easy to talk to. I moved to Scottsdale over a year ago and needed to find general practitioner. My boss's wife is in medical supply sales and referred me to Dr. Bachenheimer. I couldn't be more satisfied with a doctor.   She can always fit you in, just in case you do get sick :) Call first thing in the morning and she adjusts her schedule to make sure she can get you better quicker.

I visited the new location in Tempe Marketplace. My first experience in a EWC was 5 years ago in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Olga did my eyebrows for almost a year. I was upset when I moved across the state and didn't have a EWC in driving distance. I always had them in the back of my mind every time my eyebrows were filing in and I was constantly trying new places in the Tampa area. I moved to AZ over a year ago, never looking them up. I just discovered them in Tempe Marketplace and couldn't be happier.   Always make an appointment, this place stays busy. I had my eyebrows done by Chelsey and she was great. I've never had my women areas waxed before and asked a ton of questions. She answered them very professionally and made me feel very comfortable. I scheduled a Braz wax last week and went in a bit nervous for my first waxing in a very sensitive area. Sadly, I scheduled myself for 9am Saturday morning with the intention of going to the pool at noon. After stripping from the waist down she informed me that the hair was not long enough to get a good wax. I explained my situation because I am not going to even think about putting on a bathing suit without being cleaned up. She did my bikini line the best she could and rescheduled an appointment for the following week.   They didn't charge me for the visit even though she helped me out. I felt like a jerk not being able to tip Chelsey, so I will make up for it when I go tomorrow.   This wax is a strip-less wax that is a deep shade of purple. It turns to a soft plastic consistency and they pull off the actual piece of wax when removing the unwanted hair. I have found this to be a LOT less painful, especially when in sensitive areas or if your skin is all over sensitive.

LOUD, scantly clad girls dancing on poles in the back (doesn't bother me but causes the crowd to be comprised of the next complaint), gross, drunk old men drooling underneath the dancing girls, impossible to get a drink on a busy night, and if you do manage to get a drink it will be promptly spilled everywhere as ten people try to get a spot at the bar.    The best time I've ever had at the bar is LEAVING.
