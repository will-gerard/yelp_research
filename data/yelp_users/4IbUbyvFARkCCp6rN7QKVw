We originally bought our BMW SR1000rr here and thought there were a stand up bunch of guys, but after a terrible experience with our recent 6,000 mile check up all I can say is GO TO SCOTTSDALE.   Victory BMW's service department either honestly doesn't have the competence to know what they are doing or are actively trying to rip you off. Our bike went into their shop working beautifully and came out not starting and stalling to point it was un-rideable. Problems dragged on for 2 months before the bike is finally working again.    Things happen. We just wanted them to own to the fact that the mechanic made a mistake and fix the bike. Instead they repeatedly tried to charge us for parts and service that were covered under warranty, showed a complete lack of initiative to resolve a problem that they caused, and ignored the symptoms only to waste time fixing parts that weren't broken.    Sorry to say we would strongly recommend you avoid Victory BMW's service department and watch any bills closely for false charges.

Word of mouth is so true!  This place is a lifesaver for knives!  OK, I admit it. I put my good knives in the dishwasher before I knew any better.  Then I waited until they were so dull I could barely cut up a tomato before I finally took them in to see if they could be saved. While I was a bit embarrassed by the lack of my knowledge and the state of my knives, especially knowing the high professional caliber of the real chefs to frequent this place, the guys at the Phoenix Knife House couldn't have been nicer.  They gave me some helpful advice, were patient answering my questions and were super fast.  While I was there another customer had brought them a set of knives and they were kind, but honest with what could and couldn't be done with her knives, and more importantly, why.  My two lovely knives are back, better than ever, and super sharp!  And they were unbelievably cheap!    Plus, the shop has a cool vibe.  It's small, but full of an interesting array of knives, especially German and Japanese, as well as professional chef gear, like aprons, shoes and knife cases.  The guys that work there manage to keep a laid back, comfortable atmosphere while exuding professional expertise and charm.  I've been twice now, and definitely highly recommend them!

This is THE go-to resource for parents when shopping kid toys, located just off I-10 on Chandler Blvd. They have an amazing selection of toys and books, and specialize in "real" toys - wooden, classics, imaginative play, learning, science kits, etc. They can be a bit pricier than some other toy stores, but they often have great sales (especially their annual anniversary blowout) and their selection and offer awesome customer service definitely have me come back again and again. As a parent of a super girly 5 year old, I never quite know what to buy for little boys or older kids. Their staff never fails to make great suggestions for fun toys that fall within my price range. I also love that they have lots of great items out for display so you can see first-hand how they work, or let your little one test it out. Truly a local gem!

Found Doc's from Yelp reviews, and the many 5 star ratings did not let me down! Tucked away in a little strip mall, Doc's is a wonderful place to stop in and grab a beautiful cup (or pint or tub!) of one of their extraordinarily flavored gelato from their new gelato case or - our favorite - the gelato pops (which also have some great sorbet flavors).   The gelato and sorbet are all natural, and many of the ingredients are sourced locally (like Schnepf's Farm peaches) but Doc also likes to incorporate unusual flavors, often fruits from South and Central America. Everything has been good, but our favorites so far are: --Chocolate gelato --Raspberry Chambord sorbet pop --Peach Bellini sorbet pop --Guanbana gelato (like banana)  Doc himself is usually onsite and is totally charming. He'll probably remember you, even after only one visit. And you will definitely be back!
