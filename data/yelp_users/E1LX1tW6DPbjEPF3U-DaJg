Love Japan Express - I get dinner there every week for my family. The teriyaki beef is excellent & the baked salmon sushi roll.. I'm addicted!!!

This did not thrill. Pork chops overdone, mashed potato glue, chicken fettuccine only so so, the burger was over done, the fried chicken was good per Lexi. Not a place we will return to. ;o{

Everything we had was excellent!   Manacotti, Spaghetti Bolonese, Meatballs, Chipotle Mac & Cheese with spicy Italian Sausage... S cleaned the bowl!  If you know me, no one makes better sauce, in my mind, & it's not mine but excellent! Everything was so good! We will be back to try more.  Elizabeth was awesome too! ;o}
