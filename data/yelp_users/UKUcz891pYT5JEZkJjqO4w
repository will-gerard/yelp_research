This is a great place, one of my favorites, to grab a drink and relax. you don't even need to go with people because you are often guaranteed to run into somebody you know! The drinks are poured with a giving hand and the food is pretty damn good. Often times the specials that are offered are amazing!  Casey's is a great place to hang with friends or sit and relax on a weekend afternoon.

The food here is amazing! Before going the first time I didn't understand the idea but now I love it. My favorite is probably the traditional but the Royal with Cheese is damn good too! The service is great but it is just a bit small. They are opening a second location soon and I heard it has much more space!

Ok, here is the setting: It is Friday July 4th, my new roommate (an old old friend) and I decided to go to Taliesin West to watch the fireworks.  We get there and what I think was the first full blown Monsoon of the season is in full blast. My roommate, who was never dainty till then, announced that she was not getting out of the car and running 50 yards in the rain. I said fine let's go to Roka Akor for dinner as I have been there about 5 times and the food is worth every penny, the lamb is my favorite dish and I love the Scallops! If you know me you know that is saying a ton since I don't eat much seafood.  That said: The service was another story.   My dinner date and I ordered the green tea lava cake (I forget the actual name) and were informed that it would take 15 to 20 minutes by our at times inattentive waitress. It felt at times like we had to shoot someone to get drink refills.    Because of this we ordered some ice cream/ sorbet to nibble on in the meantime figuring 3 scoops of ice cream on a block of Ice in a slow restaurant would take 5 minutes. IT TOOK 15!   When we finally got the ice cream we ate it and 10 minutes later still did not have the cake. When pressed on the time table the waitress informed us the the "pastry chef had dropped your cake and it will take another 15 minutes". I smell something you find in a disc in a field in the mid west. It is brown and when it dries you can throw it!  At this we promptly canceled the order and asked for our bill. While the Ice Cream was made Gratis I expect a much higher level of service from a restaurant that expects me to shell out upwards of $200 for dinner. The food warrants the price, the service did not.  Oh and a little extra... They have canceled lunch service for the summer.

Jersey Mike's is a Franchise based out of Point Pleasant, New Jersey that just opened in Tempe. I grew up eating at Mike's every summer when my family would go to the Jersey Shore for the month of August. Let me tell you this is the quintessential sub!   The meat is finely sliced right when you order it, and piled high. The vegetables, lettuce, tomato & onions are fresh. That's right there isn't a billion ingredients to muck up the taste! The oil & red wine vinegar mix is AMAZING! With the special blend of spices they add to it...OH MY GOD so good! The bread is just perfect! Baked fresh daily this bread is soft, and absorbs the juices perfectly.  Once again this is the perfect sub. I am so glad they are now open in Arizona. If you are not sure what to get try the #13 The Original Italian, it is the best tasting in the bunch!

On a 30 min layover I stopped in to get a steak (10/29 around 6pm). The staff was arguing because they couldn't figure out how to make a baked potato. I waited over 15 minutes for a Great Steak and fries. I had to leave and when I asked for a refund the woman at the register informed me that she could not do refunds without a manager around and the manager was not there. I told he to give me cash and she said she couldn't. I was so pissed off I walked away. I believe that this is the worst operated airport fast food joint in all of the US. Great Steak Company, the franchise owner and the manager should all be ashamed of this location. It was slow, dirty, unkempt and gross.

Hi my name is Hotchy and I am a kicksaholic.  The first time I went to High Point was at its old location in The Mix and I  got my first man crush on the store (not the workers, the STORE ITSELF!).  It sounds kinda stupid but I now understand girls who have a love for shoes!  Before I found High Point I had maybe 5 pairs of shoes: 2 Dress (brown & black), 1 pair of Bluchers (yes I still wear them and no I don't do the little tie thing with the laces) a pair of sneakers for working out and a pair of flip flops. That was it no more.  After I found High Point...I am a shoe whore! I have bought 5 pairs of shoes there, one I have yet to wear cause the look so damn good, a really cool pair of 100% recycled Adidas Gazelles, another pair of Adidas Gazelles, a cool pair of Nike's and another pair of Adidas that I wear to Roller Derby bouts cause they are the only thing I have with Pink in them.  After my last trip I had to tell my roommate not to let me go there on payday. Bad Bad Juju.  Go to High Point, the store is great, the guys there are awesome, the clothes are great and the shoes even better.  So I close as I began...Hi, my name is Hotchy and I am a kicksaholic.

When I first walked in here I was a little skeptical about it. I mean come on RICE PUDDING? I remembered it as the one desert we would get at my grandmother's that made me cry as a kid. Back then I hated it.   So it was with a little fear that I started trying it. Then I had my first sample and...  WOW!   I had the Cinibon (sp?) flavored one and it was great! Then I went down the line and liked almost all of them!  And the active culture yogurt is really good, try them both together. The pudding is only 125 calories for a 5 oz serving and since it is gluten free a lot of people can have it!  In the end I wish there was one closer to my house, that is why it lost a star.  This ain't your grandma's Rice Pudding....IT IS ACTUALLY GOOD!

Ok this is the BEST Carne Asada I have ever eaten! Granted I am from the midwest so I thought Taco Bell was good Mexican before I moved to AZ but DAMN! The recipe (an old family one of the owner's) is amazing and very flavorfull.  Try the burrito, but get something on the side as it needs an extra bit to fill you up. Don't get me wrong this is not the Overstuffed Burrito that you find at Chipotle that gets super messy and in my opinion is not very good. No this burrito is well propotioned as a meal and easy to eat. Not too messy or anything.  Also the Civeche is really great too, very fresh and crisp. The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is that it is kinda small. That's all.   Hell I give them 5 in my heart!

I went here tonight to watch the Kansas vs Western Kentucky game. I knew it would be busy so I showed up early and patiently waited for a high top in the bar since I was alone. After I got a table my waiter was right there but it took awhile to get my beer, at least he took my wing order. When he delivered my beer and wings he didn't come back till my glass was empty. It took 15 minutes to get my new beer. According to my waiter it was because the tap had bown, but I saw the bartender pouring the same beer.   As I am getting ready for the game I notice that the two big screens in the bar are on different games. Mind you I didn't expect both but 1 was on a lower seed game and the other was on a game that didn't star for 20 min. I asked for the channel to be changed and was told they don't change channels. I was shocked that a #1 team was going to only be on small TVs and started looking for my waiter to cash out, but he was nowhere to be found. Thankfully a nice waitress got me my tab but I had to go give it to my waiter. He took his own sweet time even though I was trying to leave to miss as little as the game as possible. He was a bad waiter and whoever the young girl in the white worker shirt was that said she wouldn't change the channel is an idiot.  They get two stars for 2 reasons: the waitress that helped me get out of there faster and the manager who valiantly tried to keep me there. By that time I was shocked, pissed and I had tabbed out but at least he tried. bad service, and idiotic game scheduling will keep me out of this location for a long while.

This place is great! I am here every sunday for footbal and the service and food has been good, so i don't know what Jordon is talking about. Bud, you probably got the wrong meat by accident, you could have asked someone. And as for the Promenti Bros experience: if you want that experience get on a plane and fly there. Dont hold their sandwich over a restaurant in AZ, it is not right and it is not fair.  Anyway you have to try the best culinary invention ever here: The SWEET POTATO TATER TOTS! An amazing food if ever there was one! The burgers are great and the fries taste just like my mom's homemade ones when i was a kid. To everyone that went in when it first opened, give it another shot they have made adjustments. And to everyone else go try it, it is worth it!

I came here with a large group of people, including one person who is a self professed Hot n Juicy addict. First off the service: our waitress Isabelle was AWESOME! In the face of crappy food from the kitchen she did a great job. On to the food: it was embarrassing how bad it was. I had the clams and they were way over steamed. I had also ordered corn and potatoes and the bag didn't have them. Other members of my group got ice cold potatoes. When we got the substitute potatoes those were cold too. My friend's shrimp was not just overcooked, it should have never been cooked at all! It was bad, like was probably spoiled. Just an over all bad food experience.  Like I said at the start, thank god for Isabelle.
