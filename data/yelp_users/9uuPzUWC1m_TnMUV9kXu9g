Ya know, I've come to this Denny's on and off since moving to Phoenix several years ago.  I usually only frequent this location and one in Tempe.  I'm not really sure when it changed.  Hubs and I stopped for breakfast.  We looked at the line @ Matt's (I know there IS no comparison but the line was SOOOOOOOOOOOO long) and turned around to get one of the worst tasting meals and worst service experiences I've had in a long time.    Now, I understand something going wrong with your order now and again.  But seriously, our waitress was training someone!!!!!  An order was taken and then we were left to fend for ourselves.  Finally another waitress named Crystal (ask for HER if you dare go) stopped by and filled our coffee.  We then waited...and waited.  We saw the cooks working and putting food out that just sat under the lamps.  When we got our grand slams the only thing slightly warm were the eggs.  Sausage?  Stone cold.  Bacon: frigid.  Pancakes, laughable.  And when the manager stopped by?  Let's just say that he had a very condescending attitude.  He was basically like; "well, what do you want me to do about it?"  Um, manage your people effectively!  Live up to the customer service standards expected of you!  Figure it out.  My husband pretty much put him in his place by giving a detailed description of several things he'd seen done wrong since our arrival.  He offered us ONE comped meal.  Bill still came to $15 for one breakfast and drinks.  Yikes.  For this kind of money I will stand in line at Matt's and know that eventually I'll get food worth having!

Where else are you going to buy Big and Tall guy stuff with style?  Come on!  Ever been to the "old guy style" B &T shops?  If it weren't for Casual Male (and the new form of it:  Destination XL, there would be nothing but epaulettes and high rise pants on my man!  Just say NO!

I was so lucky to get to attend this awesome party!  I have to tell you this place gives customer service a new meaning!  From walking in the door and being greeted to leaving, service was stellar!  I loved JT as a waiter.  When my husband told him I couldn't eat themini tenderloin sandwich he brought him because I have to eat gluten free....I'll be darned if he didn't bring me back my own plate which he'd had the kitchen make me which had no bun and some awesome mushrooms topping it.  He also checked with the chef to make sure it was completely gluten free!  Oh, my!  The drinks were good: Infused peach vodka!  Divine.....with a little raspberry floating in it!  The roasted red pepper soup?  I wanted a gallon of that stuff!  Yum.  Did I mention the plate of tenderloin he brought me was melt in the mouth good?  Foodgasm!  The grapefruit soda which was actually non alcoholic was extremely good, too.  I couldn't eat some of the food due to my gluten free status but what I was able to eat was worthy of a few trips back to walk my way through the menu!  Did I mention the truffle fries?  Excellent party all the way around!  Thank you Capital Grille, Lindsey, Gabi and all for a fantastic afternoon!  Did I mention the very savvy decor?  Or the fact that they opened early for us and nobody else was there?  Impressed!

Okay, I will start out by saying that I just picked this place out because it was near a bar we were going to afterward.  Boy Howdy, am I glad I found this little gem!  Upon entering I was overwhelmed with the idea that we were in an Italian friend's grandma's circa 1980's dining room.  It was quaint.  It was old school.  It kinda made me a little nervous!  The general feel of the waiter we had was extremely laid back.  Traditional Italian dude who was a little tardy in checking back, etc.  Our water glass was NEVER refilled.  Got a little more nervous.  They brought out really good looking bread and poured some herbed olive oil out for me (I declined because I have celiac disease and can't have regular bread.).  My husband said the bread and the olive oil was amazing.  I had called ahead and they said they had many gluten free options.  I ordered the Chicken al Berto.  My husband ordered veal and a side of spaghetti with meat sauce.  We started with a Tomato Caprese appetizer.  The tomato was slightly under ripe but the mozza and basil made up for it...and in the center was a bunch of roasted red peppers which totally made the dish!  Nom nom nom.  The balsamic was excellent as well.  I must now do peppers with my Caprese!  Then our entrees came out.  My chicken had fontina cheese, pancetta and spinach.  There was a little line of mushrooms in a marsala sauce which I'm not sure if it was supposed to be there or not.  I'm super happy it was!  This is close to if not the BEST chicken dish I've eaten.  The chicken was moist which is usually questionable in Italian restaurants I've found.  The quality of the Fontina cheese was impeccable.  The pancetta was crisp and plentiful.  Then I tasted the mushrooms!!!! OMG!!  Freaking amazing!  I may have to try the Chicken Marsala sometime just to have more mushrooms!  Divine.    It took a while to eat, mainly due to the waiter's "chill" attitude but we shall go back again and again and again.  I don't care if you don't get anything included with your main entree.  The portion of entrees were HUGE.  My husband loved both his veal dish and said the meat sauce was one of the best he's had.  Fresh, fresh, fresh.  It's on my new list of first priority restaurants.  And I think the prices were pretty good.  Less than $15 for my chicken, $20 for the veal and $10 for the Caprese.  I'm so there next week!  Oh, and put your phone on vibrate.  They kind of insist!  And that's okay too!

Maybe it's because I was drinking heavily (which is NOT a usual occurance!) but I really liked this little hole in the wall!  The server was fantastic!  She kept our glasses filled at just the right times (which was way too many!)  I don't think most people tip well here because she was shocked with a good cash tip. (So when you go...be nice and tip well!)   The bathroom was clean, the music was great!  The band was ReGroove, and it was just a fun night!  The clientele was interesting ;o) Drinks were pretty strong and cheap!  We'll be back for sure!

This park has new management!  The new manager is very Pro-Active and has begun to make the improvements and upgrades that had needed to be done for years.  The changes have been terrific.  The water system is getting upgraded, roads are being fixed and gates are now closed all the time.  It's nice to have this security.  The pool is huge and really well cared for and the whirlpool is one of the biggest and nicest I have ever been in.The community center has a huge area to hold parties and events in, with smaller rooms which include pool tables and poker tables.  There is a computer with free wifi and television for those who need internet access.  They also have a kitchen for events.  There is something to do if you want to or you can just relax and live in a nice neighborhood.  There is a Phoenix Neighborhood Patrol Program through the Phoenix Police.  The people who live in the park have several different options for how they choose to interact.  I like how the neighbors check on each other and help out whenever they can.  I know there have been several times that a bunch of people all volunteer to help out someone who might not be able to fix something due to income or health issues.  There have been clean up parties and painting parties for re-doing someone's whole yard or painting their trailer.  It's just a nice hidden gem if you are looking for a place where people still walk around and pay attention to each other.  Where you can be as active or sedate as you want to and be assured of a caring staff and neighbors.

This is a pretty good Home Depot.  They have really nice people who actually occasionally ask if you need help as opposed to scurrying by you ask quickly as they can so you don't have time to bother them!  The selection and in stock status of this particular location is very good.  The store is always clean and they will help you load bigger stuff if you need it.  That's a win-win for me as I cannot lift heavy stuff.

Okay so it is a little hole in the wall and the greasy smell when I first walked in almost made me walk back out BUT I stayed and ordered and I must say that I'm glad that I did!  I ordered the Tres Enchiladas plate which they changed up for me (normally you get one chicken, one beef and one cheese) to just three sour cream chicken.  I also ordered my husband the two chimi (one beef and one chicken) combo plate.  The dinners came with rice and beans and they included chips and salsa in the to go order without having to ask for it...nice touch!  I get home and open my container still a little apprehensive after the smell of the restaurant.   The first thing I notice is the size of the enchiladas.  Wow!  These were the most chicken stuffed offerings I've had from any Phoenix restaurant!  Then I tasted them......oh, they know how to do an excellent enchilada!  They were so flavorful and the sauce was light and creamy.  Totally rocked it!  The beans were also very good.  Full of flavor, nice and sticky firm and not soupy like some places.  Total win.  Only thing that was disappointing was the rice.  It was just there.  Not much taste, bland, boring.  yawn.  Overall it was amazingly cheap and very, very good!  The fact that it's just down the street?  Bonus!

I think the people who work in this bar are some of the nicest you'll ever meet.  It's kinda divey but the drinks are very cheap and the band rocked (ReGroove).  There is a dance floor which is pretty generous, the band area is elevated and there are pool tables.  The bathroom is mediocre and the tables are all raised with stools which can get tough on the body if you're there for a while............but again, the staff is awesome, they have great bands and prices can't be beat!

Very nice location with really nice employees and very good, fresh produce.  You can't beat the weekly deals and the gluten free selection is quite wonderful.  I can shop gluten free and vegetarian for my daughter with ease here.

I don't do a lot of "Corporate" shopping anymore but I have to say, went here the Saturday before Christmas (and for me that ALONE is amazing!) but the entire staff was awesome and went above and beyond to move me quickly and correctly through the store, to what I wanted and out the door after an easy line and payment process.  This staff rocks it hard!  I was impressed.

Not a great location.  The selection of fragrances is sadly lacking and the customer service is sketchy at best.  The layout is chaotic and other than the fact that it's a pretty clean store, not memorable in anyway. (Except for the lack of selection!)  Slow check out as well!

I think for the average person I would give it 4  stars but for the reasons stated below it dropped significantly!  If I cannot be safe then what's the point?  First off a yelp check in offer appears for this restaurant stating a deal on gluten free toast.  According to the Manager they don't advertise with yelp and think that yelp is a rip off because if you don't advertise with them then you get less stars...so that is why she'd never advertise with yelp. So I don't know why that comes up on my phone app.  I am a celiac so it is dangerous for my health if I eat gluten (wheat, barley, etc.)  This restaurant offers gluten free toast and pancakes.  Most people would assume that since they offer these choices then they would follow cross contamination guidelines and know how to prepare food to keep people with Celiac safe.  This is not the case. Yesterday, I had an excellent waitress.  I asked her point blank if the gluten free toast (which is more expensive) was toasted in a dedicated toaster.  She said that yes, it was toasted.  I then said again specifically, "So you have a toaster JUST for the gluten free toast?  And you are using separate utensils and butter?"  She looked at me like I was speaking Russian (and that is NEVER a good sign when addressing these issues.)  She stated, it's toasted in the big toaster we use for the toast.  AH!  So then I asked if they prepare the gluten free pancakes on the same griddle as the regular ones and prep those in the same area as well.  And the answer (that I figured was coming) was yes.  No, there is no other prep area in the back for keeping gluten free items apart.  No cross contamination education imparted.  She didn't even understand that there needed to be any procedures followed.   Now, don't get me wrong, this was a very nice waitperson.  She was very concerned when I was asking her these questions.  I asked her if she could make sure that someone with clean hands (not having touched regular items) could get me my slices of gf bread and just put them on my plate and not toast it?  And she did that for me herself!  Pretty soon the Manager came over to follow up on the gf toast issue.  I asked her again if they had training and separated areas for the gf products and she said that they did not.  I asked her why they didn't if they were offering gluten free toast and pancakes.  I told her that I get sick when the toast is made in the same toaster from the other bread crumbs being on my gf toast.  That I had eaten it there before and now understood why I had been sick!  Her answer (I kid you not!) was that people with Celiac Disease should just KNOW that a restaurant like theirs wouldn't follow protocols or that a person should ASK how they were prepared.   They just offered gluten free items for people restricting gluten from their diet for lifestyle.  REALLY?  Advertising something gluten free and charging significantly higher prices for it do NOT get you access to the safety of training your employees?  NOT stating that on your menu?  I now KNOW that she knows there is a difference since she said that she expects Celiac's to know they won't follow safety precautions!  I told her that I think that she is endangering people's health and that her answers were not acceptable.  Her entire explanation was that I couldn't possibly hold her responsible for my issues if I didn't explicitely state my needs to her so they could tell me their gf foods are unsafe for me to consume.  I won't be back!  But if you don't have gluten or other dietary issues.....go ahead on!

Okay, This would have five stars but for one thing:  We were with a group of people and two of us had groupons.  Now I know the groupon reads ONE PER TABLE....I also knew we were going to spend considerably MORE than both groupons so I asked ahead of time if we could sit together.  The person working the front said she'd go check.  The owner came out and was really very rude and said, "No, you must be seated separately and you cannot combine anything.  Totally separate!" and she was frowning.  Now, this was the first impression of several people in our party and that didn't sit well.  However, I fully intended to tell them we'd spend WELL over the limits but I told her that we were fine with being separated and all sat down.  The wait staff was very nice and our waiter especially was just a joy.  The food took quite a while but was well worth it.  It was kind of a bummer to not be all together but once the food arrived everyone was silent anyway!  We started with Calypso Chips and black bean dip which are divine.  I had the Pollo Cubano which was okay.  The highlight of the plate for me was the black beans and rice.  Those were terrific!  My mother in law had the ham croquettes which were so-so and the Papas Rellena which are heaven!  My daughter had Sopa de Pollo which was also just so-so.    The deserts were to DIE FOR!  My daughter had Marquesa de Chocolate.  Basically  chocolate ganauche with Grand Manier flavoring with the most amazing whipped cream over it.  Totally rich!  Mother in Law had the bread pudding which had her almost in tears she enjoyed it so much.  If I were to go again, I'd just get a big plate of beans and rice and a Papa Rellena and dessert.    I will go again for the food even if the owner was rude. It's that good!  Again, we spent at least 1.5 times the amount of the groupon, each. We'll be back again, but really if you decide to have a groupon to get people in, try to be mellow and accomodate them too!  Or at least make sure your food is so good they want to deal with attitude!

Yum, Yum, Yum!  Excellent authentic Italian food!  My hubby and I went out for a fantastic evening and decided to try this restaurant due to the reviews here and our restaurant.com gc!  Impressive!  The service was excellent and the food was to DIE FOR!  My husband had the chicken and sausage Cacciatore and he loved the freshness of the sauce...not overly processed but tasty.    I had the Four Cheese Chicken.  All I can say is:  arrive hungry!  The chicken itself would have been a little over the top but the combination of all the cheese and the amazing taste of the flavorful chicken just worked.  The mushroom demi-glaze was perfect with it.  Oh, and we had the fried Ravioli to start and it's much better than your run of the mill stuff others serve!  Again the Marinara makes it.  We paid about $60 including tip with our GC and we will return again and again and again!

Okay, first of all, this is kinda pricey so it's not the place I'd go weekly.  However, a few times a year this place is awesome!  They have a gluten free menu and they do host special gluten free nights at Scottsdale,  where this time, they featured Jewel's Cupcakes (soon to be bakery cafe) desserts and bread.  The second time there was a special night with a percentage of proceeds going to the Celiac Foundation.  Win/win!    First time there we had the four course meal which included the salad.  I was thinking that I wouldn't want the salad in deference to the main pot but I am telling you that this was one of the best salads I have EVER had in my life.  Seriously.  That good!  It was a specific menu for that season so I cannot remember what salad it was but it was divine!  The cheese fondue is good.  I have found after two trips it is okay, not my favorite though and IF I had to ixnay one course the cheese would be the first to go.  The Mojo pot for the main course may set you back another $6 bucks but it's totally worth it.  The flavors are awesome!  When they bring all the veggies, do yourself a favor and have them add them all in immediately to the pot.  The potatoes take forever to cook and the flavor is more prevalent after a longer cook time.   the Mushrooms are fantastic with the Gorgonzola dip.  The green goddess dip goes best with the broccoli and I love the plum sauce for shrimp and the chicken though the curry dip is good for chicken as well.  I don't do red meat so the hubs ate the beef and pork and I did the chicken and shrimp.  Nicely done!  Dessert chocolate.  I've had both the peanut butter chocolate and the Turtle.  GET THE TURTLE!  Both are good but the turtle is to die for.  Combine that with Jewel'sCupcake (soon to be cafe) gluten free espresso cream puffs and brownies and cheesecake...........foodgasm!  Seriously.  Better than, well you get the idea.  I wish they carried Jewel's items all the time to dip with.  Even her main course bread put into the chocolate was nom nom!  GO...........celebrate something.  Enjoy the atmosphere........dark, quiet.  Plan on spending three or four hours............of luxury eating!

I am giving one star for Zach the waiter and one star for Heather the Manager..... I eat gluten free due to my health issues.  I went here specifically because they cater to the GF crowd.  That being said after the time I had I am rather worried because if they are as GF cautious as they are about HOW they cook: Meh, not so confident!!!  I started out with a side salad with their house Creamy Parmesan dressing.  The dressing was quite tasty but the salad was less than fresh.  It was plentiful with carrots, thinly sliced celery and some other items but the romaine lettuce was extremely brown and had that taste which told me:  I AM NOT FRESH!  Honestly, it was so brown I just told him to take it away.  He suggested I try soup instead so I had him bring me some lentil soup which was really very good.  It made up for the salad.  My Iced Tea was good as well.   The hubs got a Magharita Pizza which he said was very good.  The basil and tomato were very fresh and good but there was not much mozz on it at all.  The dough was perfectly done.  This restaurant prides itself on being a "from scratch kitchen" and they encourage changes to menu items if needed.  That being the case, I ordered the Pollo Rosa Maria, which is grilled chicken breast stuffed with Fontina and Prosciutto, with mushrooms in a lemon butter sauce.  I didn't want the lemon butter sauce so they were going to replace it with the Marsala wine sauce...this was Zach's suggestion, by the way!  Upon getting my entree, which was two very small breasts, it was in the butter lemon and not marsala sauce.  I sent it back............and what came back?  My same chicken breast, which now tasted like a very lemony chicken breast which also had marsala on it.  If you've had either of these versions the one thing you would note is:  They taste horrible together!  It sucked.  So I told Zach that they had just given me back the original breast with new sauce and he said:  Well, it would take too long to remake the whole thing so he just put it back on the grill to grill off the lemon sauce and then replaced it with the Marsala.  WHAT???  Really??  Um, I just said FINE. and told the hubs we will NEVER be back.  The next thing I know, Heather, a manager is stopping by the table.  She says, "I hear things aren't going well today...." and I then told her our story.  She then states that not only has she taken my entree off the bill but she is making me the corrected version to go and giving us a gift certificate to come back and give them another try.  Well, I am impressed a bit by this.  Taking it off the bill was nice but adding the additional two "gives" made it almost okay.  It's too bad they just couldn't have made it a five star experience the first time....but given that they were so generous, I'll at least give them the chance to do it right.  To be continued..............

This is in a very unassuming strip mall so you might pass it up.  BUT don't.  Inside there are an amazing amount of beautiful things to buy and the interior is very soothing.  The decor is beautiful and they start a massage visit off by putting you in the relaxation room with a foot bath you can walk in if wanted.  It massages the bottom of your feet.  They also bring you a big heated smelly good neck thing to get heat going on your weary neck and shoulders.    You are then taken back to a private massage room where if you are lucky, you've booked Kimberly Stines.  If you have, then the next hour, 90 minutes or what have you, will be filled with nurturing beyond compare!  Hear the gentle music, relax and let her unkink your kinks.  I have followed her from her previous location and will always go where she goes! She's THAT GOOD!  Oh, and if you need your feet or nails done?  Diana is your Goddess!  In fact, perfect name for the people that work there.  Goddesses.  In Athena.  The only way to improve it?  Stop off at Babbo afterwards for some pasta!  Yum!

okay I really really really want to give kudos to this restaurant due to it being a Phoenix icon.  however they are struggling  financially right now and I think the reason is that while other steakhouses have embraced the fact that people want to eat healthier, adding salads and less filling foods to their menu, this place has decided to keep a very old school steakhouse fried chicken mantra.  I am gluten free and can only order ribs or chicken with no barbecue sauce.  I do have breakfast but it stops at noon which would alleviate the problem of me trying  trying to find something to eat.  because of the lack of items that I can eat, combined with the fact that my vegetarian daughter can find nothing to eat,  we won't be back so they  lost my entire family.  it's great to have traditions but you also have to change with the times.

Fresh food, attentive staff and boy is it fast!  I like the skillets and they'll sub out my toast for fruit, which is nice.  I never feel like I ate heavy, sticky, icky food when I leave and I like that.  Every single employee you encounter interacts with you with a big ol' smile on their face.  There is ONE wait person who is a little ditzy and I try to avoid her like the plague, but overall I am very impressed with this place.  Not a greasy diner, no siree!  Tasty!  I'd eat lunch here sometime too but their gluten free lunch options are just about non-existent.  I wish they'd change that.

I've taken my daughter to Dr. Shannon Forshey at Phoenix Pediatrics for quite a while now.  I  am very happy with the level of professionalism and her great personality!  They are good about getting you in quickly and we never wait long in the waiting room.    Even if Dr. Forshey is unavailable, the other providers we've seen, have all been terrific!  The other thing that is amazing is how nice every person you encounter is.  It's amazing that all the auxiliary people are cool too.  Receptionists, Med techs, PA's.  Awesome!  If you have a kid or are going to have one.....this is a great place to trust with your greatest treasure!

First of all, this is the best HVAC place in Phoenix.  Don't trust just any old company!  Kim Foster is the KING of fair and will treat you with respect.  He won't lie to you and I'll come right out and say it:  I love this guy!  I had the company our home warranty made us call when our A/C went kapput this summer come out because we HAD to use them.  The minute that the guy said it wasn't covered under the warranty I thought:  GREAT!  He came in and told me what type of unit he'd recommend and how much it would be but of course, there was a more expensive unit which would be better and he'd give me such a deal on it.  Um, right.  I asked him questions about how long the business had been around, how long he'd worked for them..........specific questions about the units he was recommending, etc.  Then I told him I'd get back with him....and I called Foster Mechanical.  Currently, it's hard to find Foster.  They have no website.......no real web presence (which I'm trying to get them to change!) but they are worth giving a call!  Kim came out and spent almost three hours up on my roof checking every thing out thoroughly.  Then he came in and chatted with me.  He told me everything that was wrong, why the machine couldn't be fixed, the unit he recommended and why (drawing me pictures to illustrate what he meant) and told me that we had a two pronged issue:  One was the unit and one was the duct work.  He walked me through everything and made sure I understood everything he spoke of.  Now, he's done work all over the 55+ community my folks live in and he never charges an unfair amount.  He came in significantly UNDER what the warranty guy quoted me for more work and a better unit.  He is very matter of fact and knows his stuff.  His guys are very professional and thoughtful.  They did everything they said they'd do and it was done quickly.  I trust them and highly recommend them.  I'm even going to try talking him into getting some social media going!  He's too hard to find...........but worth it!

For a local, smaller hardware store they really pack the merchandise in!  Always someone to wait on you and really helpful too.  There is a pretty large assortment of stuff you never knew you needed!  While smaller than a huge mega warehouse I always enjoy going here because of the excellent service and really competitive pricing.  AND it's a quick drive down the street!

I am happy that much of the menu can be ordered gluten free.  The gf boneless chicken wings rock!  The gf garlic cheese bread is my GO TO.....instead of getting the pizza.  It's $7 vs. way more for the ZA first off.  It's made with Gluten Free Creations crust either way...and the pizza sauce is  boring and toppings are bland.  Stick with the cheese bread with it's cheesy, garlicky goodness and you'll be fine.  Also the salads are fresh and a good value.  I suggest telling them to cook the gf crust options a little less because they tend to arrive a bit overdone.  They carry so much gf due to a family member being gf.  Just wish they (and many others!) would do their own gf crust (like Picazzo's) because the GFC crust is okay but not WOW!  BUT I'm soooooo very glad they carry so much GF!  The regular items are usually a hit at our house too.  The thick crust gets rave reviews.

Gee, I guess Our experience is a weeeee bit different than all these others!  Amazing that customer service didn't happen for us over a RETAIL $13 dollar item so bad service over a probable $3 wholesale ring.  NOT GOOD.  Really not good!   I was here a couple weeks ago with my friend Joan and her daughter Sarah.  We dropped in on a whim, as we were in the neighborhood and Sarah wanted to see if there might be a hoop there she liked for her nostril piercing.  Steph and J.D. were working that day.  Steph was the primary person that waited on Joan and Sarah.  Steph brought out a silver hoop, saying something like, "This should work."  Sarah liked the looks of it, and Steph asked Sarah if she would like her to install it.  Sarah said yes, and Steph said she needed to see her ID, because Sarah is a minor.  Since we had no original plan to shop for a nose ring when we launched out that day, Sarah did not bring her ID.  Steph said Sarah could likely install it fine at home on her own, and to come back if she had any trouble.  Steph never took a look at Sarah's piercing or asked the size of her gauge.  Joan told Steph twice that Sarah did not get her nose pierced here, but somewhere else.    As it turns out, because Steph did not look at Sarah's nose or ask the size of her piercing, Steph chose a hoop with a gauge too small for Sarah's nose. So when Sarah got home and tried to put the ring it, it made her nose bleed.  Joan immediately called HTC, and J.D. answered the phone and the conversation went like this:  Joan - "Hi J.D., my daughter and I were just there buying a nose ring. We came home to put it in and the gauge is too large and made Sarah's nose bleed. It must be the wrong size, and I need to return it."  J.D. - "Oh, I'm sorry. We can't take returns, but I can give you store credit. Isn't her piercing an 18?  Joan - "No, it's a 20."  J.D. - "We only do 18's on nostrils here."  Joan - "I told you guys twice that we didn't get her nose pierced at HTC.  We got it pierced at Halo.  I had no idea that different places did different size standard piercings for nostrils. And no one at your store last night asked Sarah about the size of her piercing after we told you that we got her nose pierced somewhere else."  J.D. - "I'm very sorry about that. Like I said, we can't take returns, but I can give you store credit.  Joan - "That's fine. See you tomorrow."  When Joan went to exchange the nose ring the following day, neither Steph nor J.D. were working.  A dreadful person named Richard was there.  Richard told Joan that J.D. had no business saying that HTC would give her store credit, because once a piece of jewelry leaves the store, HTC will not take it back as a return or even for store credit.  Richard then asked if Steph examined Sarah nose or asked about her gauge size.  Joan explained the whole story about how none of that occurred despite the fact that Joan told the staff twice that Sarah did not get her nose pierced at HTC.  Richard suggested, "Why don't you come back again when Steph and J.D. are working, and maybe one of them will give you the money out of their own pocket because this was their mistake and there's no way HTC can reimburse you."  Joan could not believe her ears, and was she not about to make a THIRD trip back to the store for what would likely be another futile, frustrating encounter!  So, Joan and Sarah were out the money for a worthless piece of jewelry. This is about one of the worst customer service stories I've ever witnessed.    The story does have somewhat of a happy ending, in that Joan got her money back through her credit card company when she called and told them the story.  They couldn't believe their ears either and refunded her immediately.  Moral of the story:  Businesses, is a really unhappy, connected customer really worth bad press over a $13 retail order?

Okay, It's a Sears.  This location is about as exciting as the rest of Metro Center has become over the years.  Pretty sad, really.  About a small step up from the Desert Sky Mall location, this Sears is where I go to pick up my online purchases so I don't have to pay shipping.    Downside?  Um, I picked up an order today and I received 4 pair of pants WITH NO bag!!!!  Just handed me four pairs of jeans and buh bye.  It's really odd.  You walk in and have to either scan your receipt or slide the credit card through the slider that you placed the order with.  Then it tells you to have a seat and then a person brings your order out.  I'm kinda surprised at that point that your order doesn't just shoot out from a hole in the wall!  The entire store is like a mausoleum with hardly any employees around.  I like getting my daughter's jeans here but other than that?  What do I like?  Not so much.  I guess it's good for appliances.  Yeah.  appliances.

This is kinda like a roll of the dice.  Lots of really nice items but you have to look through the haystack to find the pin!  Every time I have taken the teenage daughter here to find some clothes I end up with a very happy kid and I'm happy with the bill.  Why get a piece of junk from a lesser retail place when for time and effort you can score a $280 dress for $13?  I have!  Name brand, absolutely.  This season, mainly.  Great selection?  Depends on when you go.  Some days we find a ton of things to take home.  Sometimes one....but always at least 75% off original price!  Usually I'd say 90.  It's terrific for a mom of a teen who is hella picky.  You could score some deals on home furnishings too but I think most tend to be rather bland and not worth my time to look through but if you are willing to search there are some diamonds among the stones.

We went here looking for a dining room table set.  It is also a consignment store called iconsign.com.  We looked all day everywhere.  East o West Phoenix.  This was hands down the highest quality and lowest priced consignment store anywhere!  We found a HUGE Bernhardt conference table which was 8X4.  Excellent shape and they gave it to us for a steal!  We priced them and we literally paid 10 cents on the dollar!  They also recommended a mover who was prompt and efficient!  I bought a few other things while getting the table.  Excellent service and we're going back to see about some custom framing as well!

My daughter is nine and already very serious about her art.  We've been trying to get her to all the happening Art venues in the area....so we got our Culture Pass for SMoCA and ventured forth.  We went on a Thursday, so we didn't even need to Culture Pass (Thurs are free) but I side with the other person that said if they would have paid they'd have felt robbed!  I guess I was expecting something along the lines of more stuff!  The Paolo Soleri Bridges exhibit was pretty cool and so was the Keys exhibit.  Who knew keys could be so neat as art work?  But the rest?  I know, art is subjective......but my take was that my daughter's artwork exceeds most here.

Even though the interior is a little less than stellar, I was very impressed with the service and the food.  I had the chicken enchiladas and they were so tasty I couldn't get enough!  The iced tea was perfectly brewed and I'm a tea snob!  I think I'd like to try a cheese crisp next time and be there when the music is loud and proud!  I went with a great friend who has been going there for years and that probably made it even better but I'm game to go back again!  It's a landmark for a reason.

Can not say enough good about this place.  I love it.  I love it!  I simply love it!  We have always had really great service and the food!  Well, the chips are thin and salty yumness and I love the salsa.  They keep you filled up and aren't like other places which try to ignore an empty container!  Number 16 Combo is my guilty pleasure!  I have had it many times the way it's intended:  Chicken enchiladas with red sauce...but lately I've been getting it with Fundito sauce and I've gotta tell you:  I'm hooked!  Try it........it's a little more $$$ but SO worth it!  I haven't had desert since I'm gluten free but the size of the fried ice cream is Gigantic.  My daughter swears by it!  Man, I wish they were open right now...cravings have begun anew....

So, I've been meaning to get to Fez for maybe three years now and so it was really great to finally get there.  I have to say that the wait was worth it but I'm sad that I haven't partaken of the food this whole time due to my tardiness!  I had the Fez Burger since I had heard so much about it.  The pears really do make that burger!  All the food ordered around the table was met with happy smiles and yums all around....fries were crisp and flavorful, drinks exceptional and the service was quite impressive!  We were thanked for coming in and we WILL be back!  I have quite the menu to work around!

This is a terrific Red Robin location.  We came in on a Friday night and were pleased to be seated right away.  Our waiter, Derek, was attentive, helpful and quick!  He brought us french fries while waiting for our meals and that is always a plus!  He got all of my quirky ordering items correct.........for which he gets extra points!  I like mayo with my fries and I need a gluten free bun and need my food to be handled with clean  new gloves and he took care of that.  My chicken sandwich came out flavorful and not bland like it is at the Happy Valley location!    So I will go to the Mayo location to get my mayo!  HA!  Seriously, we had a lot of picky eaters and he was amazing!  Everyone we encountered was very nice and personable so as a National Chain goes.......this location is a keeper!

I have NEVER had a bad meal at Ticoz.  I go often and I love food!  The service is terrific...very relaxed atmosphere but the food always rocks and the staff top notch.  I've had many things off the menu-but my favorite is the burgers.  #3 is to die for!  It has a lime mayo that makes it quite tasty.  The criss cut spicy fries are a great accompaniment and I usually take the oriental coleslaw home for people to fight over!  I also got to see Alison Du Bois eating lunch here , too!  The pineapple salsa is good but the chips are only so-so.  But hey, that's the worst thing and that's ok with me!  **update 08/14/09: went for lunch and it was as good as EVER!  We had an awesome server, Pablo.  He was very attentive and enhanced our meal!  He's a terrific addition.  In fact, the whole staff today seemed very, very efficient and good!

So I have been a customer at Ticoz from literally day one.  I have been through the change in ownership and I have to say that the current owner, Joe, is so terrific!  He comes over and chats with us and is always so awesome and down to earth!  The food is even better lately (if that's possible) and they always go the extra mile to make your dining experience terrific.    I'm not someone who has been to this restaurant one time and is reviewing it......I am not a paid spokesperson!  Just a very satisfied customer.

We've been meaning to get to this intriguing restaurant for quite a while.  Well, for Valentine's day, while everyone else was jacking up their prices, they were offering a $10 off $30 through Sunday night, so we went one day early and we were NOT disappointed.  The Caprese salad and Antipasto salads were divine.  The Fritti plate which in our case meant half mozza and half zucchini was so fresh!  The mozza literally melted at the touch.  Our entrees were very good as well.  My hubs got the Papa combo which consisted of veal, lasagna and some spinach manicotti.  He said it was spectacular.  My Chicken Saltimbucca was very good but a bit dry for my taste.  I saw many other orders go out that looked very yummy so I'm going to go again and again, working my way around the menu.  The service was excellent with Barbara offering suggestions and helping in any way she could.  Now, this is not the most glamorous place on earth but it's comfortable and you feel like family!

A year ago I would've given five stars but there's been a change in chef and manager and I don't know if it's been good.  Mind you we visited the second week of the new manager change so it might get better.  Still pretty good but they sent the wrong thing home with us (hubs went to get his lunch pasta out of the fridge in the morning and they'd wrapped up the appetizer we had left and told them we didn't want instead....oops).  I called back to let them know that hubs didn't get his second pasta dish and was told that I could come back and get it.  I told them we lived a bit far to do that....and then the manager just said that we could stop in any time and just ask and they'd give us one.  Nothing above and beyond.....and considering we'd driven there I didn't think that was cool.  When you have to go back to get something THEY forgot I think there should be additional compensation.    So, I went online to their corporate site and let them know what happened.  They made it better!  They offered another dining experience on them to give them another try.  I don't understand why the local team wouldn't offer that given how many choices we have in restaurant options in the Phoenix area!  Also I am pretty sure that the OLD staff would have handled it that way.  I go because they are great about making a lot of the menu gluten free if they can.  There is a gf pasta option which you can put with most entrees.......except the lasagna's and ravioli's, manacotti's etc.  So the filled pastas are not offered in a gf option. (score one for Picazzo's here).  They also USED to offer a gf bread choice as well.  You had to pay for it but I don't mind that....now they don't even offer it.  Ugh.  Okay, again I feel like a second class citizen as the rest of the table sits with the amazing olive oil blend with their bread!  I have had many of the Chicken dishes made gf.  I had the Masala this time and the Masala tasted off and was very brothy as opposed to saucy.  My garlic mashed potatoes which I subbed for the pasta side were excellent and the creme brulee was superb.  I have had the lobster carbonara which is very good as well and not a bad price for the amount of lobster you get.  Overall I am appreciative of their gf offerings and I hope this new team gets better so I can enjoy going there again.

Is it expensive?  Absolutely!  Is it divine?  Absolutely!  We went there for our Anniversary and the entire place knocked us out.  Extremely clean and impeccably designed location.  From the moment we walked in , we were treated like royalty.    The food was amazing.  We started with a Fettunta:  Grilled bread with the most amazing organic heirloom tomatoes.  We tasted the Pizza Margarita.....we had the Pork Chop and the Linguini with Day Boat Shrimp.  Oh, so very, very good!  Everything was very light and rustic.    Then, they brought an Anniversary Cannoli on a plate which said" Buon Anniversario!"  in chocolate script!  It was compliments of the restaurant!  Perfect end to a meal.  Mike is an awesome waiter and I'll request him again when I go back.  Then we went into the bar.  The drinks were a little expensive for my taste (who'd have thought!) but the bar tender told us about the  current Happy Hour from -5-7 when all the snacks and appies are half off and wine is currently 25% off.  That would make a pretty tasty little meal.  Now if the drive weren't so long......  But what an exciting night!  And do try to sit on the patio.  We didn't and I wish we would have requested it.  Gorgeous.  Hats off to the Chef.

First off, I love Italian food and I am forgiving when I go eat it...but I've been here several times (I didn't pay or I probably wouldn't have gone back after the first time!)  I've sampled several menu items, including the Chicken Caesar Sandwich and the Eggplant and the Fettuccine Alfredo and honestly?  My Alfredo is better!  The biggest problem is that the chicken has been very dry as was the bread...stale, really....and the Fettuccine with Chicken was very bland.  The sauce was like a bottled sauce.  meh, I didn't buy my meals but I won't take my money here either!

Where did all the customer service go?  Where did all the good products go?  Is nobody donating anymore?  Unimpressive furniture which was overpriced,  Displays were no more than placing a shirt over a bust form.  Paper clipped signs on a Chanel purse in the case.   I was in the store for over thirty minutes and did not see ONE person greeted or helped.  WOW!  This place has gone down hill.  Loved the plastic bins outside with signs such as: Crafts n Such.    Are there any volunteers here?  I saw three paid staff chatting the entire time I was in the store.

You get to buy local, there are always fun event specials every year like Phoesitivus in December and buy organic greens, order grass fed meat if you want to and get all manner of candles and soaps and lotions.  Tamales, check.  Jams and Jellies, check.  Coffee?  Check.  Friday lunch?  Food trucks converge here for a food frenzy unseen anywhere in the metro area!  Go ahead!  Try to find a seat or a truck without a line!  I dare you.

Love the customer service, the produce is always fresh and a terrific deal and the choice of Gluten Free foods is amazing!  I love the customized coupons you can get when you join their email list and they are terrific at answering questions posted on facebook.  I really take advantage of their twice yearly gluten free sale as well as their overlapping Wednesday sales!  I love that you get the joy of two sales flyers price then!  The meat department is good as well and everything is very fresh.  Oh, don't forget the essential oils and vitamins and nutritional products!  Great selection of organic and specialty items.  Love it here!

So, I've been diagnosed with Celiac's disease and as such, have started my gluten free journey.  Now, at least I live in Phoenix instead of some rinky dink small town with no choice!  I see gluten free options popping up and Pugzie's is a front runner in this journey due to the owner having a child with Celiac's (or so I heard)...whatever the cause I am sure glad that they offer choices for me.  I love the sandwiches!  The meat is very good tasting and generous!  The fruit salad was large and fresh.  They also offer gluten free soups and cookies.  When doing a pick up the gluten free sandwich is wrapped up well so as not to touch anything from the rest of your order, which I thought was awesome!  The place is kind of lack luster in looks but the gluten free options make it a winner in my book!

My friend Joan was going to meet me at Nourish123 in Scottsdale on Monday, but luckily, we both noticed that it's closed on Monday so we ended up meeting at Nick's at Tatum and Shea.  We go where we have groupons, etc. and she had one to try it out.  I can honestly say that I was quite happy and surprised when I showed up first and saw a sign outside of the restaurant which said they were featuring a gluten free pizza for less than $10!  I was all set to just have a salad but this changed my mind.........since I figured an Italian place would have great pizza!  I entered the restaurant and saw that I had arrived first so the Host greeted me and I told her I was meeting a friend.  She said that she'd bring her over when she got there and seated me.  She asked what I wanted to drink and left to get my Iced Tea.  She came back with the Tea and a bowl of bread, which I asked her to remove until Joan showed up.......too hard to look at something I love and can't have!  Then she informs me that they closed at 2:00 p..m.  I really don't understand why she failed to mention this to me when I sat down!  We might have decided to dine elsewhere....and before I ordered a $3 Iced Tea.  It wouldn't have bothered me to order a $3 Iced Tea if it were good but it tasted like Lipton Tea which had been in the canister for a week............you know, when it tastes like tin?  So Joan arrived and we decided to eat anyway........and I ordered the GF pizza with tomato slices, mushrooms and onion.  Joan got a bowl of soup and salad.  We chatted and waited for our food.  The pizza looked pretty decent with lots of mushrooms and veggies present but upon tasting it I was immediately aware of no spice taste.  It tasted like they opened a can of tomato sauce and poured it on the pizza.   Between the pizza and the Iced Tea and them not letting us know that they closed in half an hour, I'd have to say that I would never go back or recommend the place.  When we didn't have a large enough order to even make using the groupon worth while, Joan asked for a dessert to go...and was told that there was nobody present to even prepare it, sorry!  Yeah.  I'll never go back!  That's ridiculous!

We have been to the ER here as well as having been admitted for both in-laws.  Each time we've been treated to excellent service...with nice big private rooms and very nice nurses.  I am very impressed with the deli portion of the cafeteria as well.  Elia rocks!  She's very personable and remembers you.  The Tuscan Chicken Ciabatta is freaking awesome!  So good with added avocado that I'd go there just for lunch!

I used to go to a VERY expensive salon.  It cost about $55 for a haircut.  Now I go to Michelle at this Cost Cutters.  She is amazing and at less than $15 for a haircut...well worth it!  I have my hair double processed for color and what would have cost between $200 and 300 at the other place costs me around $80 here and I have very long hair!  Michelle is very professional and extremely nice.  I don't know if I would come to someone different but as long as she's here I will be a customer.

I will drive to this Fry's every chance I get!  This is the Grand Daddy of all Fry's stores!  YES!  It's got covered or valet parking, they'll bring your groceries out to you curbside, they'll even get your car washed while you shop!  The bakery is to die for but unfortunately they make nothing gluten free.  They have whole bars of ready made dinner type items.  The olive bar is massive as are is the sitting area near Starbucks.  Leather and massive yummy chairs.  I jokingly said to my Mom that I might start hanging out there all day with my laptop.  Seriously.  Seriously that nice.  The whole store has wide aisles, massive choice and excellent customer service.  Gourmet chocolate, why yes.  Organic section?  YES.  A jewelry store, bank and a huge area of home accessories and furniture items.  Clean, well lit, flowers, odd fruits, cooking classes.  That too!

I love Pizza.  I love Pasta.  I love these two foods more than any other food on earth.  Seriously.  You can imagine the first thoughts going through my head finding out that my two favorite foods I LOVE would be off limits.  Ugh............the travesty!  Oh, the injustice!  Then I began searching for places which carried GF pizza crust.  I knew it was out there.  It didn't sound very appetizing, but it's all I can have, so I searched for all the reviews.  I read and researched every one I could find.  I was pretty sure that out of all of the competition one stood head and shoulders above the rest.  Was I right?  Well, I won't know for a while due to the fact that it's the first GF Pizza I've tried.  I seriously doubt that any other GF Pizza will ever top it though.  Oh, yeah it is THAT GOOD!  Quite honestly, it's one of the better Pizza's I've ever had!  GF or NOT.  Where is this place?  Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen: Tempe, AZ.  They have six Arizona locations but this one was inviting, clean (bathrooms spotless), service spectacular and food was delectable.  This place understands GF issues and you feel perfectly fine ordering from them.  They have separate ovens and preparation areas for all GF foods, and so many eating options for the entire family, GF or not.  We started with the GF Organic Garlic Cheese Bread.  Such a great start!  It is served with Olive Oil with a few very tasty olives in it.  It could have been a little more "garlicky" for me but it was still extremely good.  Light and airy with a terrific amount of Cheese on it.  It didn't last long on anyone's plate.  I had the Diavalo Specialty Gourmet Pizza.  The GF comes only in Medium size.  The crust is quit thin but very tasty.  It consists of an Organic tomato sauce, with mozzarella, pepperoni, red and yellow bell peppers, caramelized onions, andouille sausage and red pepper flakes (I did LESS Diavolo and omitted the red pepper flakes!)  The sausage still had a little kick to it but not overpowering.  Divine; pure and simple.  The Hubs had the Pepperoni, Sausage and Ricotta on Picazzo's Original Crust (not GF) and was extremely happy with his choice.  The Mother in Law ordered a Half order Natural Chopped Italian Salad Which had so much meat in it she was shocked!  Pepperoni, smoked ham, and salami.  It also lettuce,  garbanzo beans, organic tomatoes, a significant amount of fresh mozarella, black olives, pepperoncini, Parmesan, GF croutons and Italian Dressing.  Completely GF, huge for a half order and looked amazingly fresh! The child was quite happy with a small cheese pizza!  We then finished the meal with a few desserts.  Yes, GF too! I brought most of mine home.  A skillet Brownie.  It's about 6 inches around with non dairy organic ice cream and organic chocolate sauce!  Joy and Bliss rolled into one!   This will be a "Go To" place for sure.  Probably only for The Hubs and me, due to the pricing, but what a date night!  I can have Pizza!  It's a little "Pizza Heaven on Earth!"

If I were able to eat gluten then it might get more stars.  If it were fall and they had their pumpkin soup on the menu they might get one more too....but here's the thing.  We had about five different people wait on us, and we still aren't sure who our official waiter was.  The five that came did so sporadically and would forget and ask the same questions twice and then when the drinks came, they were adequate.  It was happy hour so that's good but the wait was quite long to receive them and then when asked if I was ready for another and I said yes, he came back again another fifteen minutes later and asked the same question.  Um, yes!  Rather than have a salad, or pay over $20 for an entree, I opted for the black rice dish. Or "Forbidden Rice Bowl" with supposedly 7 veggies, ginger, garlic and sweet and spicy dressing. The veggies were very al dente.  Asparagus and tomatoes being the shining stars of the dish.........altogether it was ok but not memorable.  For a drink I had the  Santa Rosa;  finlandia vodka, st. germain, pink grapefruit &basil.  It was good. Not the strongest drink I've had in Mid Town Happy Hour but it was good.  My friend tried the Mezcal Mule; sombra mezcal, gosling's ginger beer, cucumber, agave &passion fruit........and sent it back as unbearable.  She opted instead for a glass of   Walnut Block Sauvignon Blanc, which she said was divine and a Market Vegetable Flatbread which she said was "okay."  It took a while to get someone to take our money and overall just not that impressed.  My friend did say it is usually packed during happy hour with much noise due to the hard surfaces everywhere......but this Thursday night it was quite dead which did not help to explain the lack of customer service.  There are just way too many better places to go than to spend $20 on a broiled chicken dinner or bowl of rice.  Sorry.

I love Costco.  I love their company policies, they treat their employees well and they treat their customers with respect.  If I get something that doesn't work then I take it back.  No problem ever returning anything.  Their offerings are plentiful and they've really been adding more organic and gluten free options which I am very happy about.  This location has very good selections at it.  Better than many of the other clubs around town.  You can't beat the deal on the rotisserie chicken and the seasonal items are worth grabbing as soon as you can!  Great club...gas pricing is cheaper than other locations as well.  Always clean and respectful staff.

All the Picazzo's are great.  This one is no exception.  I can get quality, organic, GLUTEN FREE food where they understand cross contamination and I can eat without worry of getting sick.  The Happy Hour is fantastic with half price "small plates" which include yummy Turkey Meatballs in a wonderful sauce, garlicy cheesy bread and yummy chicken drums and wings.  The pizza is the best GF pizza I have ever had and the Chicken Parm (I sub out all alfredo sauce) is the icing on the cake.  Everything I have eaten is good.  Salads are HUGE.  The only thing I personally dislike is the roasted veggies that come with the entrees....but I am not a brussel sprouts fan.

Smelly Dog is the find of a century!  Our two standard poodles can become darn smelly dogs and this is just the most awesome place to make them look beautiful again.  I've had Standards for about 30 years now and I've never had my dogs look as good as they get them to look at Smelly Dog.  The price is fantastic too!  I also like that the pups are never put into a kennel and they are much happier when I pick them up here as opposed to other groomers I've taken them to.  We will NEVER go elsewhere...these people ROCK!

So, yes, I'm the millionth reviewer...but Geesh, this place is so good I'm gathering up the whole fam damily and taking them tomorrow.  We stopped in about two weeks ago and after reading the reviews here, hit it at 11:00 a.m.  And that was a lifesaver! We went right up to the register and placed our order.    We got a Fontina Burger, a Farm Burger, a Kids cheese pizza and a side order of Onion Rings.  The burgers were very good as were the side of fries you receive.  I think the fries were some of the best I've had around Phoenix.  They were crisp but not greasy and full of flavor.    The kids Pizza was the only disappointment (our daughter didn't care for the sauce and I have to agree)....but the O rings were yummy too....  Best part of this meal?  Easily the fantastic Vanilla Malt that we all ended up sharing (and by sharing I mean grabbing and gulping to get what you could!)  Tomorrow I'm trying the Chicken sandwich...Gotta work around the menu!

So, I have been to Joe's two more times and each time I had the grilled chicken with Pecan Pesto sandwich.  I have increased my rating from 4 to 5 stars based on the absolute loveliness of said Chicken sandwich.  Wow.  Go.  Get it........taste it and you'll be hooked too!  Go now, what are you waiting for?

This is one of my favorite upscale thrifts in town.  You never know what you might find and the little shop outback can also house some finds.  Great sales and the staff is very helpful.  Really worth your time and the prices are ah-mazing!

I love Ticoz and finally made it into Switch to check it out.  First of all you can't go wrong with the $5 monthly deal.  Then there's the Cowboy Burger!  Yum!  I get mine with no barbecue sauce but you do what you want!   Baked Lobster and Crab Puff Appetizer is divine!      My Mom always love the Sangria Salad...and we're usually all very happy at  the completion of our meal.  Food is really fresh, Blueberry Cosmo is terrifically refreshing.....get going!  What is it that you're waiting for? I really like dining at locally owned spots and will continue to enjoy all of the great local eateries.

I am honestly quite baffled by a few reviews on here!  I have been going to Switch for a while now and I go regularly.  I love their unique soups and the fact that they now carry gluten free buns for your enjoyment (and I am sick of eating "lettuce wraps" at other places because I have to eat gluten free)  There is an additional charge for the gf bun but it is very, very good!  Love the hummus plate and they always sub cukes for me (gf)........yum!  The weekends are dangerous with the HUGE carafes for $3!  OMG........get a DD already!  Their brunch items are excellent and the quiche is made with a potato crust so, again, I can eat it!  Thank you Switch!  I bring friends here all the time and they always make us happy.

So we thought that my husband's car needed brakes and I was sick of getting royally ripped off in Phoenix auto repair heaven!  I had seen 180 Auto advertised through Ticoz and Local AZ and decided that a woman who offered classes to non-mechanic women might be a great choice in a mechanic.  We dropped off my hubby's car and they called to ask him why he thought he needed brakes.  He told them that he heard a grinding sound and just assumed at 45k that it might be brakes.  Well, they told us his brakes were fine and we didn't need to pay for something we didn't need.  Um, what?  I've NEVER had a mechanic tell me I DIDN'T need something.  I suspect that even the times that may have been true, I've never known it because they either did the job and charged me or didn't and charged me.  I go back with my other vehicle tomorrow to see if IT needs brakes!  I will never go anywhere else again!  I love Bogi and Christina and can recommend them with NO hesitation!

We've been here twice and I have to say, that for a chain, it's pretty darn good!  I get the Parm crusted chicken which is Yummy!  My hubby gets steak and it's always prepared perfectly.  The baked potato was "loaded" but I'd say lightly so...  The appetizer Firecracker Chicken Wraps is really tasty.  The sauce they use is too hot though, ask for ranch (and their ranch is great!) The ice tea is not watered down and the desserts are pretty good.  The Ultimate Brownie Sundae is HUGE.  More than enough for two, or three...you get the idea.  The service has been exceptional both times and they seem to be sticklers for service...boy that's so nice!  Manager has been present and helping each time we've gone.  Join their club at the website for a free appetizer coupon and go get some grub!

My friend Joan had her husband's birthday party catered by this joint.  All I have to say is AMAZING!!  They knocked it outta the park!  I am gluten free so I was happy that there were enough choices for me on the buffet.  I wasn't able to eat Pita but my hubs said it was good.  I did sample the hummus and Baba Ghanoush which were both spot on!  I used cukes and tomatoes to eat these amazing bites of flavor.  The earthy, smokiness of the Ghanoush was delectable and the hummus was silky and nutty.  The buffet also contained basmati rice (fluffy and flavorful), Dolmas (hubs said these were okay), salad that was very tasty and filled with veggies, falafel (little bits of heaven), steak and chicken shawarma (very, very flavorful !), Pita chips (looked great but I couldn't eat them ;0(,    TzaTziKi Sauce (perfectly seasoned!!) and black olives.  I've probably missed something but I have to say  that the choices were fresh and plentiful.  I was so impressed that these people have got a new customer!  Always looking for great food places and Joan said their pricing was extremely fair.  If you want a great twist with compliments from your guests at your next catered event I would totally call and check this place out!  WOW! She said they were wonderful to work with and THAT is hard to find these days!

The food is fantastic!  The best Italian I've had in town.  WOW!  Tortelloni Alla Panna is so yummy!  The bread is so chewy and not stale like at other places.  The oil they serve with it is a bit HOT so be careful!  My husband had veal, others with us had Spaghetti with the biggest meatballs I've ever seen, Ravioli and more.  Everyone was very happy with their selection.  My mother in law could NOT keep commenting that her dish was very hot when she received it.  Hot, not just luke warm!   The owner coming by to chat is awesome...I'd give them 5 stars easily except I've had the same waiter twice now...and he's so cute to look at but he's just an okay server.  Needs to be reminded of the little things like refilling glasses-and that should be done without prompting.  But again, very cute-so you could almost let it slide...........almost.  I'll keep going here because I'm addicted.  Just hope that more attention is paid to the service issues.

I was introduced to Dolce by a friend and recently attended their Spa Girl's charity event at the Borgata.  I was really amazed at the quality of service which was extended to every guest!  This was a charity event and many mini services were free.  I got a chair massage by Gia and it was so wonderful that I booked a one and a half hour combination massage and an hour reflexology appointment with her as well as a hot stone manicure with Erin.  I must say that this was far and away one of the most relaxing days of my life!  They took a stressed out Mom and caregiver and turned me back into a relaxed and soothed woman!  Gia has magic hands, that's all I can say!  The beds are amazing-they can be adjusted a ton of different ways and she took care to make sure I was completely comfortable, adjusting it to my needs throughout the time.  I cannot express to you enough that you should see her soon!  I then continued on to Erin who gave me another excellent massage with hot stones on my arms and hands!  It's a great pampering treat itself!  I highly recommend Dolce Borgata and Dolce in general for all of your Spa and Salon needs.  You probably won't be disappointed!

Pretty darn good lunch!  Good fresh food, excellent service so I was pleasantly surprised. The only thing is that by the time you pay for each little individual thing, I think the value of the family dinners at Maggiano's far exceed the value here.  I will return again for lunch but would do family dinners at Maggiano's for sure.  We split a Garlic Bread with cheese, had two drinks and split the Quattro something plate (one Cannelloni, One Manicotti, two shells and some ravioli) and the check with a $10 off $20 was still about thirty bucks with tip.

So, I read the great reviews on Yelp and when a friend suggested going here I was all over it!  Yes, let's go do Vintage!  So we get to Hollywood Regency Vintage and are overwhelmed with the selection of really cool vintage items.  There was an excellent selection of vintage jewelry and cool things rarely seen elsewhere like lipstick holders and little tin containers to "hide" hairspray under....and I was impressed.    The woman who is the owner seemed very helpful and friendly....however, upon commenting on a gorgeous dress in the back room, the sales associate working said to us "Yes, you think Prom with that one....but I had a woman 'OF A CERTAIN AGE' try it on and she looked pretty good in it too."  (She exaggerated it and meant OLD!)  Then she turns to my friend who is one of the youngest looking,  beautiful women I know , (who looked about the same age as this sales associate)  and says: "I think you might look nice in it as you are about the same age she was."  Really?  Really?  She said that?  About a customer??? Did she forget in less than a minute that she called the other customer ancient? (she was dressed like a fifties Lucille Ball and maybe that kind of thing was said in the 50's??  So my friend looks at me and says in the nicest way:  "So, I think I'M done here, you?"  And we left.    I have worked in customer service and retail management for years and have never heard such a thing said to a customer.  WOW!~  Needless to say I will NOT be back.  Really?

Seriously bummed when we found our "neighborhood Fry's".  After moving North I was excited to see what the area Fry's would be like.  Well, it's not what I'm used to.  Not a big selection, seems narrow in the aisles and the customer service is just there.  I opt to go elsewhere these days unless they're running a helladeal on milk.  Not worth it.  (I'll drive to Tatum and Shea for the good stuff!)

I've been to Satara Thai quite a few times now....I've always had exceptional service and divine food!  I do NOT like hot spice so I always order NO SPICE.....today was simply perfect.  We took our nine year old daughter for her first Thai food experience.  She really enjoyed it.  We got several things to share..starting with the lettuce wraps, these are served with mango and a pork ginger filling.  Tasty!  Then I got an order of Pad Woon Seen-Crystal noodles with chicken, carrots and a million other delightful things!  Always yummy.  We also got a curry: Gaeng Galee, yellow curry with coconut milk, carrots, potatoes and chicken.  Score!  OMG, I love this dish!  The hubby got Black Pepper beef which had lots of pepper, mushrooms and garlic.  He got his with some spice but I could handle it!  My daughter tried everything and I think we have a new Thai lover!    The restaurant is very nicely appointed and I love the waterfall feature, but it always makes me have to go visit the equally nice restroom!  I really like this restaurant and recommend it to everyone.

I am soooooooo happy!  I'm rocking the five stars because Indulge Burgers has a whole gluten free menu!  They just don't offer to serve your burger in a "protein wrap" which means throw some lettuce around it, they actually have an entire gluten free menu AND their servers are knowledgeable about the whole issues we celiac's have with cross contamination issues.  Since I am newly diagnosed I am so happy to be able to go to a restaurant and not worry about my food!  My hubby enjoyed the free homemade potato chips that were brought to the table and the server made sure I knew that they were not gluten free.....which is awesome!    Let them know as soon as you walk in that you want the baked fries and they'll start them.  They take longer but they are quite good and you get a huge portion (which we both ate from and still had some to bring home)  And my burger was excellent as were the condiments.  Everything was fresh, my gluten free bun was yummy!     I'm going to try a chicken sandwich next time and I will absolutely be back!  Phoenix needs more places willing to understand the issues some people have dining out with nutritional issues.

Great Costo.  They are different than the regular warehouses.  Specializing in restaurant and convenience items this warehouse is packed with supplies and bigger food packs.  I love the selection of Torani products as well as prepared veggies (cut and ready to serve onions, lettuce, salads, etc)  They don't carry everything that regular Costco does and some things are too big for the regular home customer but the ability to buy plastic restaurant style glasses for cheap is terrific! (great for tile floors!)  I love the selection of snack foods and specialty drinks.  I also buy Thrifty Ice Cream here!

Other than the hour and a half wait in line :) , we took my in laws to the buffet for Easter (after checking it out on Yelp) I think it was the least expensive Easter Buffet in Phoenix at $23.95 and it was worth the wait!  They served Champagne until 3, they offered Prime Rib, peel and eat shrimp and Seafood Pasta.  I can never understand why people start on the salad bar with food like this!  This buffet is the best thing this side of Vegas.  Even including many of the buffets in Vegas I've had.  The food was very fresh and tasty, the service was okay, coffee strong and really quite nice!  There was an awesome selection of food and yum.  If they have the chicken cordon bleu bites, get some, they were my favorite!  I'll be going back-it was well worth the wait!

It's a little on the pricey side but you can be assured that your meal is free of gluten and that's worth a lot in my book!  The owner of this establishment works well with the GF community to ensure his staff is trained in cross contamination.  The other thing that's great about Picazzo's is that almost everything on the menu can be made gluten free.  I always get the Diavolo pizza gluten free, GF of course!  The pizza is covered with caramelized onions, red and yellow peppers.It also includes the most amazing andouille sausage and pepperoni.  I have never had a bad one!  Their appetizers are good as well.  I can get great salads, cheese bread and hummus with pita that I can actually eat!  Life is good!  They even have a selection of GF desserts.  What's not to love?  This location always has pretty good service and consistently good food.  It's so nice to go out and not have to worry or explain your dietary restrictions!

Justin and Just-In Time Moving is the bomb!  We moved right near the 4th of July and it was a very last minute move with a two story 5 bedroom house.  They accommodated our every request!  We moved twenty miles across Phoenix and they were not only on time but professional and helpful throughout!  The team leader kept everyone on point and nobody lagged or relaxed.  We were completely moved and set back up with everything re-assembled in less than six hours!  The guys were all top notch and very respectful.  We were amazed at how easy and non stressful this move was!  I have recommended this company to everyone I know is moving!  I hope I NEVER have to move again but if I do this is the only choice for me!  Awesome experience start to finish!  Call them!  They rock!

If you like small town diners and gravy covered food then you will feel right at home at Alexi's.  There is nothing inherently wrong with it but having celiac and needing gluten free food makes this a difficult to impossible place to eat.   My Mom (also GF) ordered the sliced gravy with mashed potatoes with NO gravy.  We told the server that we could eat no bread products or anything which would have gluten, including gravy....she seemed to understand and said she'd tell the cook.    When the plate arrived my Mom went to cut the turkey, we found stuffing under the turkey!  Um, stuffing IS bread!  I have never eaten there again.  But other family members love it.  The ones who eat beef and "old school" products.....I just won't ever trust them for food sensitive issues.  If you want diner food then you will be happy.

Excellent bar food.  The burgers are so totally greasy and flavorful!  The beer battered onion rings are worth waiting for.  The service rocks at this location and we are happy with both food and service every single time we go.  Can get very loud on the weekends, but HEY, it's a sports bar!  Nice flatscreen televisions located throughout.  Bathroom is always clean.  Yup, I'll be back!

Normally wouldn't give that many stars to a chain type place but I am blown away by their customer service and attention to detail.  I emailed to ask about their gluten free cooking practices and they answered back quickly and with great information!  I feel safe eating here based on what I've been told and have seen.  As of this writing, all of their sauces are gluten free.  Their chicken is marinated in a soy based sauce that may or may NOT be gf so be forwarned!  They cook their gf pasta in it's own water as opposed to plopping it into used regular pasta water (which means it's no longer gf and is a way some restaurants which serve gf pasta do it, so be careful and ASK!)  The pasta and the sauce was fresh and flavorful.  The bread smelled divine and I was totally bummed that I couldn't have any!  The service was good and our food came out fast!  I will be tripping around this menu for sure!  Awesomesauce!

When I see a China Mist Iced Tea container I usually feel I'm in good hands.  I don't know if they just use the container and are using a cheaper brand of tea or it's just not strong enough but the Iced Tea was MEH.  I am picky about my tea!   Pizza is near and dear to my heart and when I found out I had celiac disease and could no longer eat main stream pizza it just about killed me!  I have embraced the gluten free lifestyle during the past year and have been on a journey for excellent gf pizza.  I found it at Picazzo's and pay a very good price for it.  When I saw the $18.50 price tag for the "House Special" gf pizza at Mellow Mushroom I thought:  Cool.  Pricey but should be an excellent za.  Here is the explanation of ingredients:  Red sauce base, Mozzarella, Pepperoni, Sausage, Ground Beef, Onions, Green Peppers, Mushrooms, Black Olives, Tomatoes, Ham, Bacon, and extra cheese.  Wow!  Sounds great right?    Okay, first off I am not a ground beef on za kind of girl.  So I asked not to have any. All the GF pizza is on a 12" crust.  Pretty standard.  I asked and the server said that corporate makes their flour and sends it to them to make in house.  Okay.  The crust includes bean, rice and tapioca flours as well as many other things.  I have had gf pizza's many places and I have to say that this crust was the worst I've ever had.  Including those made with mixes from the store.  It was nasty.  Soggy cardboard about sums it up.  I finally gave up and just scraped the toppings off to eat those it was so nasty.  The toppings themselves were okay.  The meats were forgettable but the veggies were pretty good.  I think I've decided I prefer yellow and red peppers over green and I really prefer those and my onions caramelized vs. fresh. The other thing is that their tomato sauce was extremely bland.  Tasted like mediocre tomatoes which were just pureed with no spices whatsoever. Come on, it's almost a $20 little pie.  It needs to taste like it.  My husband had the regular House Specialty pizza and he was equally unimpressed. I won't be back!  I know where I can get my $20 excellent pie and this IS NOT it!

Okay, they just deserve 5 stars....why?  Well, the food is always fresh here and so tasty.  Combine that with spectacular customer service and you get 5 earned stars!  Who knew a burger joint could be so well run?    Soooooooooooo many restaurants need to check this place out and copy them please!  The management here is always in touch with what's going on, helping out wherever needed and that is impressive.  Having been in Management for many years I tend to notice this.    I've been several times and every employee you interact with is accommodating and pleasant!  The Smash Chicken Sandwich is heavenly!  So nicely seasoned and tender.  The whole grain bun is an added YES.  The Smash Fries are my fav!  Malts rock and I hear the Root Beer Float made with Haagen Dazs is to die for!

You know?  Didn't ever go to these stores before moving to this area.  Didn't think they were very nice.  This location always has really quirky, nice people working there and the prices are good, great during sales.  I find Hanes pricing actually much better than the bigger counterparts like Target or Wallies.  I have been going about once a week lately and they always have something at a decent price that I need.  Got a mop for $7 which costs $14 easily elsewhere and chips are consistantly less expensive here than grocers.  The store is clean and well stocked and while I probably wouldn't buy clothing here it's a nice addition to my regular findings!

These guys made buying a Cockatiel for my kid so easy and fun!  They are family run, very reasonable and knowledgeable.  I never feel stupid asking questions.  They have great hours and they will clip wings and do nails, etc. if you call ahead to make sure they have an extra person working.  Did I mention the prices?    Also the place is spotless.  So clean that I can see why their birds are happy and healthy.  Great place that I will always come back to.

Quirky, unique, retro, odd.  Whatever you're looking for you just MIGHT find it here!  Amazing amount of stuff.  Very large selection of second hand, vintage items from a lot of different vendors.  The fact that there are so many eclectic vendors makes it fun in my opinion!  I saw a pair of Demonia boots for $29!  If ONLY they were the right size!  My daughter is intrigued by the really creepy dolls scattered around (not my cuppa) but it takes all types, right?  I have found so many neat little things here from a retro stainless breadbox to glassware, tin boxes and all things cool.  There are some really lovely deco clothing  armoires, jewelry and accessories that we just find ourselves coming back again and again.  Usually the pricing is spot on!  The ONLY major downer is that it is extremely HOT here as there is no A/C.  Yeah, THAT hot!  So go on a cooler day and search to your heart's content!

Best Turkey Burger Ever!  Hands down!  YUM!  Joyful flavoring makes this thing amazing.  They understand cross contamination and I can get a gluten free bun with gluten free fries (dedicated fryer) and the fries are to die for too!    The quality doesn't seem to change no matter what location you are at either!  This location is very clean, open and inviting.  The wait outside can be a bit hot in the summer as there isn't much room inside if it's busy but it is worth the hot mess to dine on this great food.

Yum, Yum and Yummy!  Okay, I went here with a deal coupon but I've stayed due to the awesomeness of the food.  Waiters Nicole and Bill are super  and since becoming gluten free I am so obsessed with ANY business that carries a gf bun........but one that doesn't charge for it?  Uh, love them!  Oh, but that is not all............currently they have a Monday night special to DIE FOR!  Any burger and fries for $5!  No upcharge still on the gf bun.  Sweet Potato fries (they are coated my gf buddies-but they don't bother me) are fantastic and the curry dip divine.  Each Monday a different burger is added  to the line up and it keeps it so exciting!  The rest of the menu is very good and I even go on other days!  The only downside is that all the surfaces are hard and the noise can be a little over-powering.  However, the food more than makes up for it.  The whole look of the place is very cool as well.  I'd love to live there!

My people.........The Vig Uptown still rules but they now charge an extra dollar for that gluten free bun.  Just started.  Hey, Monday still makes it a $6 burger and fries, so I'm all good!  We get there a little after 5 now and take advantage of some half price appetizers!  Then at 6 we put our burger order in.  We are cheap but the food is NOT!  Value, quality and great service.  Sometimes you wait when they're packed but who cares?  Best darn value on Monday in town!  Nicole is my favorite waitress!!!  Ask nice and they'll sell you some dip for the sweet potato fries!! ( I cannot duplicate it at home but still want it when I fry them myself!)

I like Five Guys.  Liked them even better when I ate buns and red meat.  Now I still eat their fries.........because they are made in a dedicated fryer.  See there is no other item on the menu that they make in their fryers so I don't need to worry about being glutened there.  Awesome!  Oh, and said fries?  Done in peanut oil so they are beyond YUM!  They are also very good about doing a bunless burger for you with extra toppings if you cannot eat one.  I've had them bunned (before celiac dx), bunless (while still eating red meat) and none...........  The only bummer here is there are only burgers and fries and drinks on the menu.  No chicken sandwich.........so I cannot even order a bunless chicken.  That makes for only fries I can eat.  Luckily, my family can eat here and get me fries and I can run next door to Chipotle for a bowl and everyone is happy!  Oh, did I tell you that I mix mayo and catsup together for my fries?  Try it.  You'll love it or be grossed out by it.  Yeah.

We went in search of Art in the Phoenix area yesterday.  We started at SMoCA and were highly disappointed.  We decided to venture downtown and check out some of the little antique and thrifts around.  When we entered this store I was immediately impressed withe depth and quality of their products!  Very nice pieces and the ART that we finally were seeking was found!    Such a fun time.  All the people we encountered who worked there were very nice and made us feel welcome.  Thanks for the art!  Finally!

I am telling you that this is my favorite summer place!  The fro yo is amazing and the place is so clean it looks like you really COULD use the five second rule here.  I won't but okay.  The interior is not only clean but it's appealing and the customer service is astounding!  You can get points on each purchase if you sign up for their mobile club so that helps and the toppings!  I don't eat them due to being gluten free (and I don't trust buffet type food lines) but my daughter piles an amazing amount of toppings on, usually, at least three divergent yogurt type flavors.    She will do things like mint, cookies and cream and pineapple ALL in the same cup with these odd jellyball type toppings along with chocolate chips, crumbled oreos and more.  I like clean combos.  Tried and trues.  Chocolate and Peanut butter.  Choco/vanilla swirl!  Pineapple and , nope just pineapple!  Yum!  They list allergens easily, I never feel like there is a cross contamination at the yogurt pumps themselves but I do avoid the buffet toppings.  That's just me not wanting to be glutened!  Pile them on!  Just remember, the more you pile, the bigger the bill!

I went to Sprouts and picked up the GF bread.  It was like a brick.........tough, hard and very unappealing.  I have heard from other friends how horrible the bread selection in their area is.....I was so bummed.  I love bread.  Love it, love it, love it.  Only further up on the list is my love of Pizza and Pasta (more on that in the next post!)  So last Saturday, I got the Hubs to take me around on errands.   Before our lunch at Indulge Burger, we journeyed into Gluten Free Creations Bakery and Cafe.  It's located at 76th Street and McDowell and it's well worth the journey.  Upon entering the Cafe we were greeted and asked if we needed help finding anything.  I was pretty sure we could find what I was looking for so I declined help.  We were able to check out the frozen items and I picked out a loaf of Herb bread and a loaf of Cheddar Cheese bread.  I then saw chocolate chip cookies and pounced on them.  There are no prices listed for these items and you honestly don't want to know them!  Okay, I'll tell you.  $12.99 for a dozen cookies and $8.99 for each loaf of bread.  My total came to over $30 with tax, etc.  Pricey, oh, yeah.  worth it.  You betcha!  So we make it to the counter, fully intending to pay and leave, and the cashier asks if we want to try some samples.  Um, yeah!  We tried the snickerdoodles (which I should have turned the chocolate chip cookies back in for they were so good!)  I'll get them next time......  Oh, then we tried the "Insane Chocolate Donuts4U".........6 donuts for $9.99 and they are SOOOOOOOOO worth it. My husband was ready to kill for a whole one and he can eat regular donuts!  I would say that's a score for GFC!  Now, we also tried the Cinnamon Coffee Cake which I didn't care for (due to an aftertaste) but The Hubs enjoyed it........again!  I have to give 5 out of 5 stars to this discovery!  I will be back again and again!  Oh, and you should be happy to frequent many of the fine restaurants (like Pugsy's) who serve their bread....it's good!  Oh, so good!

I went here when my massage therapist Kimberley Paige Stines started working here.  Nice interior....colors were relaxing and the waiting area was comfortable.  The room was not a little cramped but not bad....but I would lay on a cement block for a massage by KPS!  Sadly she left here right after I got my "two hours of heaven."  But I will go wherever she is..............anytime, anyplace, anywhere.  Look her up.....find her and schedule in some goodness!

OMG!  Yummy stuff! Best  Froyo I have had in years!  Brand new, clean and fun! The creaminess of this frozen yogurt really caught me off guard!  I planned to just sit and wait while my daughter and hubs ate.  Gotta tell ya, that lasted all of one bite!  I was hooked!  This little spot is, well, spotless!  You could probably eat off the floor it's so nice looking.  The people were very nice, everything was easy and at 39 cents an ounce, it's not a bad deal either!  Will be back for sure!

THIS is one of my fav places in all of PHX.  I eat here about twice a week and they know me!  I love the staff and the quality.  When you tell them you are Gluten Free they immediately take off their gloves, wash their hands and put on new gloves.  They then change out each utensil in the dishes you want to have and then make your bowl or tacos to order.    At this location they are all very cool about it and don't make you feel like you are a pain in the patooty for doing it either!  They always smile and have a good time while they wait on you and IF your to go order isn't ready?  They've always given me a free drink while I wait.    Many restaurants could learn a thing or two from seeing this crew work!  Even when busy (and they almost ALWAYS are) they make you feel important!

Okay:  Try to get Sam as your server as she seems to be terrific!  Some are slower and just plain not up to the challenge!  My suggestions are:  Anything made with Jewel's Cupcakes (see their yelp entry!)  items!  This includes the Monte Cristo sandwich Gluten Free, GF French Toast, etc.  They may have some of her desserts as well.  GET THEM!  The sweet potato tots are like little pieces of melt in your mouth goodness!!!!  My daughter had the chocolate chip pancakes and my husband had the breakfast burrito.  It's a little spendy so I probably wouldn't go here weekly but for excellent gluten free choices with TASTE........it can't be beat.  The patio is pleasant and the Iced Tea is good.  Give it a try.........especially if you're GF.

If you don't go to Eddie V's Happy Hour (Reservations recommended, really!) and partake in the delish food and beverages then you just do not LIVE!   Where to begin.  SO, I don't really like going to The Quarter.  Parking is a bitch and it's quite a walk to get anywhere good (Eddie's does offer valet though) but we were getting Pedi's at Dolce and I wanted to take my Mom for a Spa treat and dinner.  Oh, and she was the designated driver because, have you HAD their Cosmo?  It's a triple pour Vodka for $6.00!!  And it's probably the best Cosmo I have had hands down!  Being gluten free by disease, I have to make absolute sure that both the cooks and waiter understands this.  I had an issue the previous time with a biscotti being put in my fruit dessert....but THIS visit we had Joey G. and he rocked!  We were there at 5:15 so we could dine before the very loud music began at 6:00. We shared a shrimp cocktail and each had a gluten free hot crab cake.  Great place for a celebration...but make sure you make reservations even for Happy Hour!  The place is usually full!

Cute stuff reasonably priced.  Always a fun trip!  Customer service is usually pretty good but they also let you just kind of journey in on your own to discover all of the Treasures hidden amongst the junk!  I like that stuff seems to turn over fairly quickly so it's always new.  I like that they advertise their bigger pieces on Craigslist so you can see what they have ahead of time but for the little stuff it's still pretty much a "pick through" event.   Worth the trip since there are several worthwhile little similar stores on Indian School near here.

Love this store, Love this store, Love this store!!!!  It is soooooo amazing!  All of their spices are gluten free except for some of their baking stuff and the staff can tell you if you need to know!  The choice is amazing.  Who knew there were so many different types of Chili's or Marjoram's or Oregano?  And season mixes?  Some are fantastic and some just stinky....but there is something for everywhere here in this store which is so clean you coud literally eat off the ground!  Did I mention the staff is very helpful but they don't hover.  I only wish they had some coffee beans because after about the fifth spice I don't know if I can really smell the next one really well.    Go, smell, buy!  You can spend just a little bit or you can really go crazy here so be careful!  Oh, and if you like really good chip dip?  Get the spice mix and add it to some sour cream!  It's divine!!!  AND gluten free!  Oh, yeah!

If I could give twenty stars I surely would!  I have been wanting to try Jewel's Cupcakes for a while now....and I decided that I was going to for the Holiday's.  I haven' t had cake since becoming gluten free almost a year ago.  I decided it was time to indulge!  I ordered a Chocolate cake with chocolate ganache icing and chocolate cream cheese filling. I've learned that with gluten free bakery items that you take what you get and I try not to get too excited because I've been disappointed by the taste so many times....well not here!  No sirree boy!    I LOVE AND ADORE Jewel's Cupcakes!  Well, okay.  Cake.  This cake rivals any full on wheat flour cake I've ever had!  I'd go so far as to say it is the BEST cake I've ever had.  Oh, yes............I'll partake of many items from this amazing woman!  I want to work my way through the entire menu available!  Joy is supreme.  Tummy is happy and I won't be sick.  Thanks for this amazing piece of heaven on earth!

Okay, it's been a while since my last review of Jewel's Cupcakes and I have eaten my way around the menu since the last one.  Julie, the owner, is so easy to work with!  She makes eating gluten free an easier task than it was before meeting her.  I think her chocolate chip cookies and snickerdoodles are little pieces of heaven.  The chocolate chips are plentiful and the spice level in the snickerdoodles is just perfect.  Brownies....moist, creamy, chocolate and hard to quit with just one or two or.......you get the idea!  Oh, banana bread?  YES!  I've been gluten free for about 15 months now and I have YET to eat a treat anywhere that rivals or even comes close to Jewel's treats. I have also been attending Julie's cooking classes that she has occasionally and I highly recommend them as well.  She sells her own flour mix and I use it for several things that I've learned at her classes.  We've made apple pie, biscuits, chicken tenders, " hand pies"  (little pies which are filled with meats and veggies for main meals or fruits, etc. for desert pies).  I look forward to what the next class might offer so that I can incorporate more choices in my gluten free journey!  So whether you want the most amazing desert ever which just happens to be gluten free (she offers many other options such as vegan, dairy free, etc.) or to expand your cooking options by buying her mixes and creating some of your old favorites that you've been missing...........give her a call.  You'll be so happy that you did!

I think this may quite possibly be my favorite farmer's market in Phoenix....or at least tied with Road Runner.  The con is that Crow's Dairy doesn't attend (Psssst....they SHOULD!)  The big Pro for me:  Jewel's Bakery & Cafe (Jewel's Cupcake Shop) is here with an amazing amount of mouth watering baked good which I can eat safely!  They have several gluten free (and some dairy free, vegan free, etc.) items and I know I can order ahead of time for pick up as well.  There are some other gluten free items at this market as well but I am always cautious about buying from unknowns as I get so sick if glutened accidently.  There are several stalls of veggies and fruits as well as gifts and I can get my Tamale Store fix as well.  OH, Did I mention that Jewel's and several vendors are INSIDE this church?  YUP......get outta the sun and chill!  They have a breakfast set up as well.

I had no clue what I was doing when I went to this restaurant!  I've only eaten Indian food a few times and this is Southern Indian food.  It is also vegetarian which is fine with me as I tend to not eat a lot of meat.  First off:  This place is clean!  I mean this place is spotless.  You seriously could probably eat off of the floor.  Wouldn't but could.  Also I think the staff is cute!  All these amazing men running around from table to table.  I had a groupon and you have to tell them upon entering (and the sign on the door will remind you!) but I don't think they treated me any differently due to that.  I think they did kinda laugh at us behind our backs because my 12 yr. old daughter and I had NO clue what the heck we were ordering and we wound up with plate after plate of food!    There was seriously enough for an army and the whole thing came to about $40!  So I don't understand other people saying it's kinda pricey.  I think it's a great deal!  I loved the Onion Pakora.  I am gluten free and haven't been able to have onion rings often due to this.  Well, The Onion Pakora is a nice altenative.  I did like the tamarind sauce served with it but I took some home and they were even MORE amazing with my own Roasted red bell pepper garlic aoli!  We also had Sambar Vidai, which is a lentil dumpling kind of with a stew type sauce.    It was good!  We also got Paneer Pakora (Fried cheese) which neither of us cared for.  Then a Cheese Masala Dosai, which honestly we took home and I fed my daughter for lunch the following day as she LOVED the Masala.  We also took home a coconut Uthappan, which neither of us cared for.    My daughter loved the Batata Vada deep fried potato balls covered in chickpea flour.  It was actually a bit spicy for me but she ate them up!  Yeah, I said we ordered way too much food for the two of us.  We actually ate a few more meals out of the left overs...and the waiter was very gracious about not teasing us.  I think he was awesome!  Service was fast and great!  I think I would go back and just get onion pakora and an order of Sambar Vadai and call it way more than enough!  If you are ready to try something new I suggest giving them a try!

Food Truck Fav right here!  I've been wanting to try Pizza People's Pizza for a while now.  I found out they were setting up at 180 Degree's Automotive and I figured if Bogi was hosting them then I needed to check them out!  I finally caught up with them at Local Fest.  Bogi was actually there helping them out and she told me that they were only sampling the regular pizza and the gluten free pizza was $8 but she assured me it was yummy!  First of all $8 for a 2 item gf crust pizza is a deal!  Secondly, Bogi said they were her some of her best friends in the world...and I trust her implicitly....so I ponied up my dollars and waited about six minutes.  I ordered my pie with pepperoni and fresh tomato.  I took it back to my table to share with my Mama (who is also gluten free) and we both said at about the same time: " Oh, my gosh this is really good!"   Something I've only said about twice since eating gf pizza!  The sauce is fresh, the dough was the best gf dough I've had to date and the toppings were just divine.  I need to put a GPS tracking unit on this truck so I can track it daily! (Oh, wait.........I can just check their facebook page!)  Yeah, I'd eat it daily!  It's that good!

Love this place! Get row F if you can!  Okay, so you can get groupons all the time for like $6 which includes a non alcoholic beverage!  That's a deal!  Even if not, go on Ladies night or late at night and it's still a deal!  The cool thing is that they have these little "love nest" type chairs where if you go you can cuddle.  Downside is if you're alone and sit there you might be closer to a stranger than you wanna be!  You get a little slide table in front of you if you're in certain rows.  Then other rows are made up of a counter with office chairs.  You decide where you want to sit (assigned) so that it's kinda nice and forces me to go ahead of time to get row F in the middle!  Once seated you can look at your menu (Oh, yes, they have a full menu!) and then when ready you press your little button and BAM!  Waiter comes to you.  Their Iced Tea is very good and I can even get a gluten Free pizza for just a bit more than a normal restaurant would charge.  NOTE:  If you're in a packed movie, I'd forgo food.  Takes forever to get your food and LONGER for the drink.  Don't know why but you were warned!  I usually go after a movie's been out a while and during the week to avoid the crowds.    Did I mention there's a full bar in the lobby?  YUP.  Really, why would you go anywhere else?

This is the Post Office closest to my home.  It is convenient to just drop something off at but it is WAY too busy to try and send something from package wise...I wouldn't want to stand in this line!  Seems everyone working here and going here is rude as well.  Hmmmmm.  Well, it works for quickly dropping stuff at.

So this place has been through the wringer.  The whole daughter/mother fight and who is running the place played out all over the media.  I didn't know any of that when I started going here.  If it were still the way it was when I first started going there then I'd give it four or five stars for sure........sadly for them I didn't write my first review here until I had a bad experience.    I started going to Citizen Espresso Bar because they carried Jewel's Cupcakes baked goods.  I am gluten free and they had an extensive line of Jewel's products along with their beverage choices.  My husband and I would come in and grab some Joe and a little treat and I'd be SOOOOOOOOOOO happy that I could eat a cupcake or roll with my coffee.  I can't do that at about 99 percent of coffee shops around Phoenix.  However, again this past fall, there is a switch up of who is in charge and now I cannot get any gluten free products now.  Now I wait again until someone gets on the ball and offers all of us gf peeps a place to get our treat on WITH our java.  When I asked about it I was snubbed and told that they were making all of their products now and gf wasn't going to be an option.  Well, I determine where we go for coffee and treats due to the fact that I need to be able to eat so...they lose all of our family business.

Going back to Cali.............to Cali.........to;  well you get the idea!  I went to the Calistro California Bistro when it was in the OTHER location.  I gotta tell you that impressed I was not!  Brown, wilted looking avocado slices served and when we let them know we were not impressed we were greeted with a less than caring; oops, so sorry attitude.    Well, we decided to try it once again at it's newest incarnation on Scottsdale Road and talk about a 180!  Woo haa!  I am so glad we went back for round two!  The manager Jerry chatted us up and was genuinely interested in our opinions on what was working now vs. what faux paus we witnessed then.  They had my friend try a new drink they were thinking of putting on the menu and she loved it!  (Way too HOT for my liking as it had a hot pepper in it......) but the food was really good, they accommodated my gluten free diet and the food was fresh and tasty!  We started with the Baked Goat Cheese appetizer, with veggies instead of crostini and it was divine!  They use Crow's Dairy cheese, which is as good as it gets!  This stuff was so good I could eat a bowl full for my lunch!  Nom nom.  Then I had the Fire Roasted Shrimp.  Spicy and delish.  Like major Delish.  It had Harissa flavored shrimp with feta, olives and more.  We had drinks that were very generous pours!  I'll be back again and again and again!  Round two was the bomb!

What is there to stop you from gassing up at Costco?  Other than the lines!  Greatest prices on gas no matter where you go. This particular location has better prices than most other Costco's even (though the Business Costco on Indian School is overall the cheapest!)

Seems like acres and acres of deals all under one roof!  I never did make it to the "home decor" section......but it was too hot to be there too long.  That's the only reason for less than 5 stars.  Industrial fans just don't cut it during a Phoenix summer.  Maybe I'll try to go early morning next time.  I love having the Ipad cart to check the prices of things.  I didn't pay full price for anything I picked up.  (see they give you this ipad cart that you stroll around with and things may have a price or some don't.  You input the inventory number into the ipad and it tells you the current price!  Excellent idea for mark downs in a retail setting BTW!).  So you just stroll and find stuff, look up the current price, decide what you want and place on your cart.  Then you check out.  I got a vintage porcelain doll, a huge piece of coral and a vintage biscuit tin for $16!  So even if it's a bit hot I will return to search again!

First off, if you're coming from the West on Indian School pay attention to the sign that says Milagro Grill is in 400 yards or feet or whatever it says.  Otherwise it's sort of hard to find. The address is 4280 E. Indian School.  It's right across the street from another of my favorite spots, La Fontanella's if that helps!   First thing in the door, we were greeted enthusiastically by the Host.  She welcomed us and seated us with a terrific attitude.  Then Katie, our server greeted us and took our drink order.  Water was brought out right away.  We decided on Iced Tea, as opposed to an alcoholic beverage.  It was eleven in the morning and I don't want to appear to be a total lush!  The Iced Tea was nice and strong, the way I like it.  Black tea and plenty of it!  The manager Jared Johnson came over and introduced himself. We discussed my gluten free status and he said he was trying to learn very quickly about gluten free eating.  He said that the kitchen was very good about knowing how to prepare gluten free foods and he was trying to make sure they do things right.  Everything is made fresh onsite, which should help with that!  They seem very concerned about making their customer's dietary needs a priority.   While we were talking, my husband commented that I loved guacamole and he'd read that their guac was amazing so Jared sent their homemade guacamole out, which is made fresh, with home made chips and their salsa de la casa, made with cascabel chili.This House Salsa was so smokey and flavorful without having a "traditional" salsa taste.  It was kind of a nutty flavor which just has to be tried!    Looking over the Brunch menu did have it's drawbacks.  The names and descriptions were sort of baffling.  Something they MIGHT want to think about changing.....but Katie was great about explaining each one!  I had the Enfrijoladas, which was basically chicken enchiladas with a white bean and tomatillo sauce....topped with an egg (I opted for scrambled).  I was blown away by the smokey taste of the chicken.  It also had some cheese but what I loved was the bean and tomatillo puree.  There was definitely a smooth hotness factor but it was so subtle and appealing that I really enjoyed it.  My husband opted for the Chorizo Con Huevos which was a flatbread with a very mild Chorizo, some charred tomato, potato and cheese with an egg on top.  He really enjoyed it and thought that the flavors went very well together.  He said the only thing he'd change is maybe have the egg on the side.  But who doesn't love pizza for breakfast?   We were really blown away with the quality of the food as well as the super efficient staff.  They have a smokin' hot terrific happy hour as well, which we are going back for specifically!  I want to try a Milagro Margarita!    The gorgeous Retro '70's feel to the decor and the large, easy to sit in chairs impressed me!  Oh, did I happen to mention they are the 2012 AZ Taco Festival Grand Champion's?  When you go in just take a look at all the awards they have received.  Quite impressive and I know WHY!  These people know how to cook and how to serve a customer. .  I am impressed!

Gluten Free is what I have to be!  I used to come here when it was part of Picazzo's....it has changed a little bit but the food and service remain good.  I love their pizza crust which seems just as it was before the name change!  Best crust ever!  The Pasta is good as well.  And my niece ate eggplant, which if you knew her you would agree was a challenge to get her to do and she LOVED it!  The open faced sandwich I had was okay but really needs a top piece of gf bread but otherwise I am always happy here.  It's my gluten free go to on the south end!  Very clean building!

Big fan of Tom Jetland's (FEZ, Switch, etc) so when  Metropolis was announced  I was so excited!  And being that I am gluten free by disease I was readily accommodated by the entire staff.  The setting is very modern and sleek.  It's a nice intimate space with a good vibe.  I started off with a Platinum Cosmo. Little more expensive than I like to go but the quality was superb.  We started off with the Hummus appetizer, forgoing the bread with more veggies.  The hummus was a nice surprise with coriander in it.  The veggies were fresh and crisp and there was a good variety to choose from.  I had the Kolkata Chicken Curry.......and they subbed out the rice (which was seasoned with gluten) for the creamiest, most flavorful mashed potatoes I think I have ever had.  Now, normally, I would think curry over mashed potatoes a bit odd.......but this was a really good combination!  I really liked it.  The chickpea sauce with tomato was very well seasoned and full of chicken.   I want to try brunch next time and have either the Met Fit Frit....and egg white frittata or the Capitol Potato Bake.  But if you have food allergies just be upfront and the Chef will work with you!  I really like the outdoor patio sitting as well.  Very well done!

Love my Sprouts, Love my Sprouts!  I love Sprouts and this new location is awesome!  Very clean store, great produce and gluten free selections.  Always have in stock situations here as opposed to spottiness in other locations.  The ONLY downside is the parking lot which can be very tricky!  Be careful it's an odd configuration and cars speed through......  I love the employees here, they are all super nice and say HI to you and the produce, meat and cheese selections are all fresh and inviting.  I love the selection of Health and Beauty at this store! Floor to ceiling!    I go out of my way to visit this location and while it's tied with 19th and Northern for my fav store.....for the next forseeable future, this is the winner due to the lovely lightrail construction on 19th!

I have to eat gluten free by disease so when a whole restaurant and bakery is guten free I can just go in and order anything!  Now, that is pretty rare for me!  I usually have to involve the chef or manager to ask about cross contamination or how something is prepared.  At Jewel's?  The work is all done for me!  Where else can you get organic, gluten free options like build your own burger, Chicken and Waffles, Pancakes, Grilled Cheese, brownies, Cartel Coffee and more?  The daily specials are scrumptious and keep me coming back time and again.  I have been a customer of Julie's since she baked out of her house and I am so happy to see this great place appealing to so many gluten free diners as well as people who have no idea this is a totally gluten free environment.  Her food is just that good!  I buy my bread there as well.  The flaxbread I can have freshly sliced and it tastes amazing!  It's so good that my daughter requests it and she's not even gluten free!  Cookies and scones are terrific as well and this is my GO TO birthday cake and cupcake store as well.  I had a Monte Cristo donut for National Donut Day that knocked my socks off!  It was nitrate free ham with brie cheese and a cherry sauce in a powdered sugar donut.  Yea, baby!

So I went here with a group of friends for the Drag Show on Friday night.  First off we waited for over a half hour WITH a reservation and we were getting ready to leave when they finally found a place for us.  They comped us our first round but at the prices they charge......made up for it on the next round.  I had an adequate Cosmo and the Yellow Curry was very spicy, even though I asked for mild.  It was still quite good and full of veggies. The waitress was chatting after the show ended and I walked my own bill to the bar to hurry her up.  The drag show was just okay.  Not great but not bad either.  Overall I was not impressed.  It would take a LOT for me to be enticed to go back.  Like a lot.  There are too many other places to try in a city of this size.  They just don't stand out and the service was horrid.

One star only because ya have to give one!  When you go to get blood drawn, having a nice person makes it a much better experience!  This is a one person show.  At least when we were there.  So you walk in and there is NOBODY behind the counter.  Another patron told us it might be a while that only one person was working.    So we sat.  Then my Mother in Law went to the counter when called and she's hard of hearing so I answered some of the questions for her. (I was sitting three feet away!) And the woman asking the questions shouts out "Who is that?  Who is answering these questions?"  Um, she saw us sitting in a group when she called her up??!!  So she's like:  let her answer please!  And so I told her she is very deaf! (and has no memory).  Long story short the woman was very short and rather rude the entire time we were there.    You would think they would have a sign which states to sign in and sit to wait for someone if there is NOBODY there upon entry.  But no, you are just expected to figure it out on your own.
