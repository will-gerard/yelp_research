My work caters a big lunch order through Vincent's Van Go operation once a month. We generally order 4-5 sandwich options and a salad option or two.  Their take on the classic Caprese is outstanding. Heirloom tomatoes are sliced with fresh mozz, teeny tiny asparagus pieces and radicchio. They also have a killer salad with various roasted veggies, goat cheese, green apples and field greens. I appreciate that they put all the dressings in individual ramekins, as well as butter for their (soft, delicious, buttery, I shouldn't eat this) bread. Each salad comes with a roll and butter, each sandwich comes with chips and both come with two tasty cookies! White chocky chip is my fav.  We have a variation of an order for 40-45 people every month, and each time our order is 100% perfect and on time, and it's easy to deal with getting an invoice for our finance department. The price, by the way, is ridiculous. We had an order for 40 this month and with tax and delivery fees, it was less than $400!  If you work in the area, I can't think of an easier catering experience for your next meeting lunch!

Could I be more of a fat kid? I'm rating one of my favorite breakfast burrito places. I didn't even know "breakfast burrito" was a food group until the past year. Arizona, you are glorious.  Boyfriend and I love to call in our orders and head out to pick up a HEFTY bag of tastiness. My staple is the potato, egg and cheese, add peppers and onion. They don't skimp on tiny ramekinitos of red and green sauce. These suckers are HUGE. Just call it a wash on yor diet and enjoy. The tortilla is light and flaky and just...dumb, OK?! Melty cheddar oozes throughout the ingredients without being gloppy. It's beyond.  I love that we've NEVER had an order mix up, which is better than I can say for almost every other bfast burrito joint I've haunted. Los Favs, your name is so correct!

Does Einstein hire only incompetent people who don't know what they're doing? As I said in my review of the location off FLLW and the 101...this place is an abortion, round two. Like, late-term status.  I don't understand why it's such. a freaking. mess. every time I go here. The problem is, it's about 30 seconds from my house. So I THINK it will be convenient for me. It never is.  I came in around 9:30 a.m. this past Saturday to pick up a quick breakfast before we headed out for the day. The "quick" pickup was anything but.  I just don't get why it's so harried/confusing/stressful behind the counter. I also REALLY don't understand why they are so afraid to yell out people's names, rather than just pretty much whisper people's names, then set their bag of food down and turn around meekly and get back to "working"...I actually said to the kid working "YOU NEED TO SPEAK LOUDER." My fiance once had his order handed directly to someone else before he had the chance to walk up to it. Really?  By miracles of all miracles, our 2 breakfast sandwiches were correct. (You better believe I checked before I left.) But it's not worth the stress and hassle. Einstein, I hate you bad.

My work uses Cactus Flower for all our florist needs, so they were the first company in my mind when looking for wedding flowers. I'm not one of those girls who has been planning her wedding since age 5 (not even close), so I brought in some Pinterest ideas with a prayer and a dream that flowers wouldn't break our budget to my first meeting with Corrina.  Well, let me tell you. Corrina was a DELIGHT. She looked over the images that had caught my eye and put together a proposal for my bouquets, centerpieces, corsages and boutonnieres that was light years more affordable than I ever thought it would be.  The day of my wedding I walked into the reception and was so HAPPY to see that everything had turned out even so much better than my Pin-speration pictures. My bouquet (along with my bridesmaids) was GORGEOUS, and our centerpiece idea came out absolutely perfect.   If you are planning any type of wedding, party, event, shindig, ho-down, etc. Use Cactus Flower. They are AMAZING.

One thing I inherited from my mom is a love for bar food done well. Not frozen and fried Cisco stuff but actual food in a fun, sports-centered atmosphere. Throw in good service and a place like Goldie's is a heck of a winner.  We had just spent the morning and early afternoon discovering the natural bridge in Payson (natural hiker, I am not) and had worked up an appetite in a reaching-hangry-levels way. Boyfriend wanted a burger and we both wanted some place we could go in our workout gear. On a whim, we decided upon Goldie's. I'd been there once with old coworkers and remembered being impressed by my tasty veggie quesadilla. It's pretty close to home, so we were off.  We decided on guac and salsa to start with. Respectable offerings from a non-Mexican place. The guac home homemade and chunky, and was tasty enough, although some spice and lime juice would have helped. The salsa was refreshing and cilantro-y.  Boyfriend ordered his burger medium, and it actually came out slightly pink in the middle and still juicy--win! He said it was an amazing burger. His fries were definitely homemade. Skin-on potatoes seasoned and piled on. I, of course, stole many.   I had to return to the quesadilla...it's random that it's so good here! The tortilla is flaky and almost buttery, the combination of unique filling (roasted peppers, onions, mushrooms, artichoke hearts) and not too gloppy cheese is fantastic. You also get personal ramekins of guac and salsa. Perfect!  The atmosphere is fun, with tons of TVs showing every possible game. Apparently there are arcade games in the back and the huge upstairs portion is adult-only. We are definitely adding this to our casual eatery list!

Guys...Samurai Sam's is freaking delicious. Give it a shot...or another, if you used to be a vegetarian and came once with your then-boyfriend and got a veggie bowl and thought it was really bland and then refused to try it again until YEARS later when you moved literally across the street and now you eat meat and the riceless white chicken/vegetable bowl with sauce on the side is your NEW BEST FRIEND. And then apologize to your now fiance (who still proposed to you even though you were basically the catalyst for not going to one of his favorite casual places in forever) and rejoice that you get to feast on these ACTUALLY HEALTHY and tasty bowls whenever you feel like it.  Cheap. Quick. Healthy (if you want it to be.). Delicious. Done!

I feel like since I practically live at this Fry's (it's about .7 seconds away from home), I should probably put in my two cents.  I'll echo the majority of the reviews: This place has everything. (" Ice sculptures, winos, Germfs - German smurfs - a Teddy Ruxpin wearing mascara, an old lady wearing Kid 'N Play hair, and none other than DJ Baby Bok Choy.") So much so that if I didn't come here so much, I think I might get overwhelmed at where to find anything.  Produce prices are pretty much the best around, except for Sprouts. Nobody can beat Sprouts' produce selection (which surprised me too, until I started actively comparing). But to factor in convenience of having literally everything else on earth in the same location, I come here the majority of the time.  There IS a reason why they lose a star. They just can't seem to get a 100% grip on their bulk section. They FINALLY invested in nice Ziplock bags (it was hit or miss on what type of bag you'd find in there...one time I found a pile of plastic produce bags laying there.) and FOR NOW they've set Sharpies up to write out the PLU number on the bags, but they seem to go missing. Every so often they revert to these terri-bad charcoal pencils where you unwrap thread from around the point to write. I've also constantly run into them being completely out of the two main staples I get in bulk: raw almonds and quinoa.   If they could perfect the bulk/"natural" section, they'd get 5 stars. But they'll get my money regardless, since they're so close. So I guess Fry's wins this battle.

Dear god I'm fat.  OK. That's not true. In fact, I've lost weight since moving out to this here Valley of the Sun. But that doesn't mean Oregano's doesn't try to suck me into obesity every dang time I'm here. Warning: This review contains lots of yelling, because the food is INSANE.  But first I want to address my one complaint: The bathroom. WHY! Why must there only be one stall?! This place is on a wait circa 5:00 p.m. every night (including week nights), why must I almost pee my pants waiting for the one stall to be vacated?!!? And it's stuffy in there too. Wah.  (Oh yeah, another review talks about this too: WTF is up with the flies in the main room? There's always one buzzing around our table. The place seems clean so...I dunno.)  ONTO THE FOOD.  It's stupid. The portions, how tasty it is, all of it. It's just dumb. Favorites include:  -Deep dish Sproccoli pizza: Are you kidding me?! I could barely finish one piece, and it's not like I didn't want to eat more. I was just STUFFED. The thin crust ain't nothin' to sneeze at, either. And make sure they take the bucket-o-parm and sprinkle it over your pie. YUM.  -Guacatony: Why. Why do they need to over-stuff the large ramekin holding the Italian-herb-laced guacamole so it spills all over the crispy perfection of cheesy-toasty "chips"?! WHY?! Because they want me to weigh a deuce, that's why!!!!!  -The veggie sandwich: WHAT WAS THIS MONSTROSITY?! PILES of grilled veggies and cheese (Provolone AND goat cheese, who's counting?), basil, and since I don't dig aioli all that much I ordered a side of marinara to go with it for dipping. I am a sandwich bandit and I could only deal with half of it.   -Pesto Penne Bake: How is this? And why is this? Pesto pasta and sundried tomatoes and cheese BAKED INTO A BREAD BOWL WHY.   -Boyfriend's favorite salad on Earth is the Pablo Picasso salad. Also, a "small" version of this is roughly the size of a football field. I'm afraid of the regular-sized one. I fear it.  -The lunch "slice" (2 big slices) with their awesome house salad (homemade Italian dressing = savior) is a STEAL.  I'm faint just typing this all out. My love of Oregano's truly exhausts me. I think I need to make a trip soon to regain strength.

I've been going to Par Exsalonce for over two years now; it's right up the street from my work and is so convenient to pop in for eyebrow waxes over lunch, or haircuts whenever I need them.  I'd pretty much gone my whole life bouncing from stylist to stylist until I made an appointment with Amber. She is awesome. I never come in with a real idea as to what I want, yet she always makes it look amazing and styles it better than I could ever dream.  I worked with Par Exsalonce for my day-of wedding planning and they were amazing. I booked a hair trial with Amber and a makeup trial with Jenn a few weeks before to get an idea of what I wanted. The ladies at the front desk took about 3483028 different calls from me to figure out scheduling. (Adding people to the morning, then adding services to the morning, etc. etc.) They worked out our final schedule a few days before the main event, and everything ran smoothly and perfectly.  All my bridesmaids got their makeup done, along with up-dos (for which my mom joined in) and again, my hair and makeup. Everyone was gorgeous and my hair and makeup were flawless. We were caught in a short downpour during the ceremony (good luck, right?!?!) and everything still held up PERFECTLY.  Par Exsalonce is almost always busy, and there is a reason for that!

I've been to Blue Adobe twice now, once for lunch with coworkers and once this past weekend for dinner with my boyf. Both trips were delicious and all around awesome. I think this place totally deserves all five of my stars.  The New Mexican twist on most of the dishes makes for a unique and fresh twist on standard Mexican food fare. Their salsa (it comes to your table in a cute lil glass pitcher!) is to die. It's smokey and chunky and the perfect way to start a meal.  My first trip included a portobello enchilada with a side of their sauteed veggies. The enchilada was covered (but not drowning in) with an Amaretto mushroom cream sauce. It was absolutely delicious, and something new. The side of veggies I subbed in were a nice variety: carrots, asparagus, onion, zucchini, mushrooms, all nice and buttery and still crispy instead of veg-mush. Not the healthiest lunch, but definitely not a gut-bomb.  For my recent dinner trip, I went with the garden enchiladas topped with their green chile sauce. The aforementioned sauteed veggies were folded into tortillas, and were delicious with a light topping of cheese (again, not completely smothered in goo, which I appreciate) and the citrus-y chile sauce. I tried some of their red sauce and it was beyond. Almost like a mole, with smokey, chocolatey undertones. I'll need to go "Christmas style" (food topped with both red and green chile) next time!  Boyfriend got a glorious looking variety plato: A relleno stuffed with tenderloin (I noted that the relleno wasn't drenched in eggy/crazy friend batter. Good!), smoked pork tamale and carne adovada. He said it was one of the most delicious mixed Mexican plates of life. It looked like it!   All in all, I'm really glad this place is so close to home. We'll be back, lots!

I can't help it. I've put off writing a review for Orange Table, as it is sure to get lost in the almost 300 other reviews (mostly glowing). But that would be unfair, as my love (and obsession) for this place keeps growing!  Oh, how I lament that I didn't know of OT's existence while I lived so close. You know how it is, moving to an entirely new portion of the country and having NO IDEA what is around you. Alas, all the tasty breakfasts and brunches and lunches I missed simply because I didn't know OT was tucked away in it's little corner of the performing arts pavilion. Oh well. I'm making up for lost time now!  Some reviews mention slow service. Yes, it can be a little (just a leetle) slow at times, but this place is so popular and busy and I can just deal with it. So can you! If a little slow, service is ALWAYS friendly. I'm not the world's biggest fan of sitting outside, but inside can be semi-ridiculous on the noise scale. That's really my only complaint.  The important stuff: The food. We do mostly breakfast, but sometimes lunch FAVORITES!:  -The veggie sandwich. It TOWERS! Fresh everything. Avocado! Drool.  -The Menage: An egg, any way, a pancake and a choice of breakfasty meat or fruit. It's such a perfect breakfast plate. I'm not sure what happened, but the p'cake has more than doubled in size in the past couple months I've been coming here. NOT COMPLAINING.   -Greek omelet: CHUNKS of feta. Kalamatas. Greeky veggies. Omnomyumyums.  Boyfriend is partial to the green flannel (Corned beef hash! green chiles!) and once tried the HUMONGOUS burger, which he deemed excellent.  Iced coffee is chocolately and delicious. Breakfast cocktails are abundant. Find a sunny spot, in or out, and ENJOY. I'll probably be there.

So we wandered into Pita House on a Sunday afternoon. It's small and unassuming. It plays techno Middle Eastern music, shows Egyptian pride commercials on their one TV and the walls are painted to look like they're cracked stone and like you're in someone's pyramid basement.   AND IT IS DELICIOUS.  The falafel. THE FALAFEL. Perfectly crispy on the outside and deliciously falafely on the inside. Three tasty falafel patties stuffed into a tasty warm pita with veggies and tahini sauce. As someone else noted, their very simple salad (uhh, lettuce and a tomato slice) is topped with a dressing made of the tears of fairies and hopes and dreams.  The tahini was added slightly on the heavy side for my liking, kind of drowning my whole falafel pita, but that's my own fault. I generally ask for it on the side and it just skipped my mind this time. No big deal. We were the only ones in there for a while but 5 or 6 other tables came in while we were finishing lunch. There was only one girl running both the dining room and the to-go shack (who looked about 15 years old) but she was taking care of everything pretty easily.  Pita House is a perfect cheap lunch decision and...I might need to get down there this afternoon.

Is it pathetic that my "happy place" is a grocery store? I hope it makes it less pathetic that it's an awesome farmer's market!  It's a little pricier than Trader Joe's, and there isn't as huge of a selection as TJ's, but I forgive these grievances because Sunflower is less than 2 minutes from my apartment.   The olive bar is the bomb-diggity. They have all the basics plus some delicious unique choices, like sliced sun-dried tomatoes (When you don't want to shell out several more dollars for a whole bag or jar of them) and marinated mozzarella.  Speaking of cheese, their section is TDF: Anything you could want! It's located next to their awesome--albeit small--selection of premade meals. They make a FAB single-serving vegetable lasagna topped with breadcrumbs. Try it out before I buy it all. They have some tasty looking breakfast burritos, but I refuse to cheat on my love, Fiesta Burrito.  The pricing on the cereal section is a little outrageous, but there are always deals on their store-brand "Kashi" knock offs. If you see Peace Cereal give it a shot, even if it's a few bucks more than your regular. SO GOOD.  Their "ethnic" (Mexican and Asian, let's be honest) aisle is pretty piddly, but you'll find most basics you need. Like I said, there are a few negatives bringing it down a star but for a place so close to me I can't help but keep coming back. It's great!

Dumb.  The one saving grace: Location. Close to Old Town, close to the bike trail, walking distance to Sunflower Market and the Coffee Bean. The price for the location would be good too...If not for what a dismal place it is.  I moved in last summer. I would have looked for a better place but I needed to get out of my grandparent's house, like, yesterday and my income was pretty laughable at the time. So away I went.  My small one-bedroom had ample kitchen storage and space, which I liked, but the stove was old and dismal and the drawers (rickety and wouldn't open and shut easily) were tacky like they had just been painted...and stayed that way for about a month.  My bathroom vent had weird build-up in it that sprayed out into my sink. Not a huge amount, but it seemed as if the AC had been turned off for a few months, so black gunk built up and collected in the sink. It grossed me out and didn't fully go away for about a month and a half.  Oh hey, another pro: There was good closet space with built-in organizers. Hooray?  I honestly laughed out loud when I saw the picture of the gym on here. RIGHT. The DIM, hard-to-find gym had two ellipticals and two treadmills and a measly weight machine and THAT'S IT. No air conditioning, no TV or radio, no water fountain. Seriously.  Some of the office personnel was nice, but some acted downright offending that I would come in for any reason. I remember I once walked to the office with my laundry because I had to load my pre-pay card (annoying, why isn't this machine in the laundry room?) at about 10 minutes before the office opened. I could see two employees sitting in there, talking, looking at me, discussing their latest attempts at Kardashianesque shit-ton smokey-eye makeup (good job, ladies, a clean and natural look on a fucking Sunday morning) and clearly trying to avoid eye contact. When I finally convinced one I just needed to get my goddamned laundry done, I was treated like a third class citizen.  I've also walked in for some questions with no one in the main room, and could clearly hear people talking (not about work) in the offices...And sat. And sat. And sat. And sat. And left. Good customer services.  What REALLY bothered me though, were my move-out charges. I BARELY lived in this apartment. From December to the end of my lease I probably stayed there one night a month average. Some boxes were never unpacked and sat in the corner. I don't smoke and didn't stain anything. My shower curtain bled some onto the tub. I was charged over $300 for that. I read reviews that they'll try to nickle and dime you on the move-out charges, and sweet Jesus did they. I ended up paying them on top of my deposit and pro-rated money I was SUPPOSED to get back for my lease being up before the end of the month. I'm just glad to be done with them.

I'm going to say something **sHocKiNG!!!!* so hold on to your butts!  NYPD pizza is better than Oregano's pizza. 90% of the cars in their shared parking lot don't know what they're doing!  Now, pick your jaws up the floor. I won't turn this review into an apology for Oregano's (who will never leave my heart for MANY reasons: Guacatony, all salads, baked pesto pasta, the list goes on and on and on and...) but, man. The pies at NYPD are where it's at. It's pizza at it's finest: huge, foldable slices, ample toppings, CHEESE, the works. The pizzas here are the stars of the show and I'm so glad we're now tuning in.  BONUS: THEY DELIVER TO ME. So when we want to indulge in Pizza Friday (or Pizza Any Other Day), we don't have to leave the house if we don't want to. And sometimes, like during this Mercury-in-retrograde garbage time, I don't want to leave the house. NYPD wins again! NYPD for Pizza President!

This review is for my wedding at Grayhawk rather than golf. If you are planning a wedding or event in the area, PLEASE check to see if Grayhawk is available for your date!  I got married this past Saturday at the Fairway House and everything was completely awesome. From the initial meeting my now-husband (eek!) and I had with Lauren over a year ago, to the phone calls and emails she kept with me, to the beautiful grounds, amazing catering (seriously. Everyone has been dying to me over how great the food was.), and last minute rainstorm plan B setup (who knew it would torrentially downpour at the end of April?), the customer service at Grayhawk was 100% perfect.   You read that right, our ceremony was soaked about halfway through and we all had to run for cover. Staff was right there setting up heaters, chairs, etc. to finish the day off. To be honest, I can't think of a more perfect day! It was an awesome memory, for sure.  I can't say enough about Lauren. She answered our millions of questions throughout the year, put us at ease, took care of our guests, and was just generally so great to work with. We had toured a few other locations for our wedding, and some of the other coordinators acted like they were put out to help us, or that we were impeding on their time. Lauren was always so was welcoming and organized.  If you're getting hitched in N. Scottsdale, I really don't think Grayhawk can be beat!

UGGGGGH.  OK.  First things first: Why the EFF is there a UNI poster adorning the dining room wall here?  As a still bitter, still angry, still crying Jayhawk, I could NOT believe my eyes when I spied this poster.  ARG.  Anyway.  My mom and I were in Arizona visiting the grandparents for a while.  My aunt and cousin had been out a few weeks prior and they all went to George & Son's.  A good time was had by all, so the gparents figured they'd take us here too.  We arrived around 6:00 (lay off, it was grandparent dinner time) and there were maybe 3 other tables in the place.  However,  as soon as we sat down and started perusing the menu, the place got crowded.  Good sign, right?  Well, NOT if the subsequent dining experience is what the crowd brought.  One girl came up and asked our drink order.  Water only, so easy enough.  Another came up and took our order.  I ordered the "spicy" tofu and vegetables (more on that soon), my mom ordered the spinach fried rice and both grandparents go the Kung Pao beef.  Still another girl came out with our food...well.  All the food but mine.  "Your's is coming out, OK?" she said to me.  Yeah, sure, no big deal.  I hung out, sampled my mom's rice (really tasty.  REALLY green.  It was like what the Incredible Hulk would have made for fried rice.), and waited.  ....aaaaaaaaaand.  Waited.  Girl who brought the food back finally caught my eye.  "Oh, fourth dish, coming!"  ....more waiting.  Apparently, they had to kill the tofu back there to get it in my dish.  Finally, my god-foresaken dinner arrived.  To their credit, it was really tasty: Fried strips of tofu, a medley of tasty vegetables.  However, this was NOT. SPICY. AT. ALL.  I'm kind of a wimp at spicy food but I'm getting better with it.  This was legit LAUGHABLE.  I wanted a bottle of Sriracha to drown my food in.  Oh!  And rice didn't come with the meals.  WHAT.  We finally asked for boxes for the three plates of food we had leftover.  Some guy came out with one small box for it all.  Commence hair ripping out.  We finally got three to-go containers and requested the bill.  You better believe I made sure to spy to see if our 15% off coupon had been added.  It had.  One of the few good things to happen during this trip.  Food is tasty enough.  Service is a complete joke.  (I noticed the table across from us waited and waited and waited and asked about their food and waited and waited some more.  Then everyone's food arrived, but the (leather-skinned, always on her phone, wouldn't shut up her obnoxious crying kid so I didn't really feel bad for her) mom waited and waited some more for the same dish I ordered.  And then an order of sauteed green beans came about 15 minutes after all their food had arrived.  Ugh.)

I like how "California" has become restaurant code for "portions that are made for actual people, rather than gigantic monsters." Everything on our inaugural visit to The Greene House was flavorful and thoughtful, and it didn't make me want to be wheelbarrow'd out of there!  Every time I'm in Kierland I note how this place (like most Fox RCs) is busy and say I need to try it. I'm glad we did, and I can see why it's so popular! The interior is comfy and welcoming and makes you want to just stay a while.   We started with the hummus, which had my favorite mode of transportation for dip-to-mouth: grilled pita. Char marks just make everything taste so much better. The herby feta/tomato topping was a tasty touch. For entrees, I chose the fresh pasta (they had me at "melted tomatoes") while boyfriend chose the crispy half chicken. Both plates were a perfect dinner portion and really delicious. The tomatoes, spinach and cheese of my obviously prepared in-house pasta sound basic, but were executed in a sublime way. I know I'm waxing poetic about a simple pasta dish, but I really wish restaurants would understand the "less is more" way of operating. Boyfriend said his food was delicious, and I stole a bite of the creamed corn--whoa!!  Since you're not shoved into a food coma here, you get to try dessert! One word: doughnut. Do it. Warm, sugary/cinnamony doughnut (with doughnut hole!), side of two dipping sauces. Oh, those dipping sauces? Some sort of vanilla cream concoction and a strawyberry jam situation. Done. Devoured. MAGIC!  I'm really glad The Greene Room is close to home. It's outstanding!

We've been to Cibo twice, both on Saturday afternoons for late lunches after perusing galleries like the goddamned refined culture vultures we are.   So yes, of course after 700+ reviews, you're going to know the product is amazing. It just IS. I've not yet subjected myself to the wait of Bianco but I can't imagine it's leaps and bounds better than Cibo. Cibo is dreamy.  First off: I want to plan a fantasy fairy wedding party in their front courtyard on a cool spring night. It's just so cute and perfect! The twinkle lights and the wrought iron and the fountains and everything is awesome. Too bad both times we've been there it was approx 48403 degrees out. Sometime soon.  Second off: The food is just sublime. What I've partaken in...  - Sardegna salad - "baby spinach topped with goat cheese, carmelized walnuts, and sliced strawberries with prosecco dressing" The salad was dressed lightly, the walnuts were plentiful, the strawberries were JUICEAAAAY! A perfect way to start a lunch (along with a glass of bubbly)  -Genova pizza - "mozzarella, homemade basil pesto, roasted potatoes, white onions and grated parmigiano" HELLO, YES, I LOVE YOU. I saw a few reviews wishing the potatoes were thinly sliced, rather than the small cubes, but it just seemed perfect to me. The gooey fresh mozz and pesto were the perfect blanket of taste under the potatoes and onion. The crust is wood-fired perfection  -Their take on the Margherita: Simple and classic. That's all there is to say. Mine had the perfect amount of basil and again, the charred underneath of the crust was on point.  So why 4 and not 5 stars if the food and ambiance seems so flawless? I just got the sense (on both visits) that the staff just didn't care to be there. I understand, late lunch is kind of annoying time to be working, especially on the weekends. But I mean...on our second trip our server came to our table chewing on a mouthful of food. What? Wait times just seem a LITTLE steep., especially with only one or two other tables occupied at both times. One time we got bread, one time we did not. I just wish things were a little more streamlined and a little more careful. I love places that let the staff be laid-back and casual...as long as their job is done. You know?   In any case, it certainly won't stop us from visiting again. The food is too good to not! We'll make sure to make our next trip a dinner event in normal dinner times to see if things shape up just a few tiny notches in order to bump them up to 5 stars!

We stayed at the Clarendon for my 30th birthday (ack) celebration a few weeks ago for a fun "staycaish" kind of night.  First impression: THIS PLACE IS SO CUTE. Second impression: FREE PARKING AT A HOTEL, AMAZING. So basically, I was pretty dang excited walking in to check in.  The lady at the front desk was super nice and welcoming and got me excited for my birthday. They said they were out of the types of room I booked so we got an "upgrade" which I think was just at a higher level of room because it overlooked the pool. It was too chilly to take advantage of the pool but I can see how this would be an awesome spot for swimming, tanning and boozing in warmer months.  Word to the wise: If you have any allergies or are sensitive about smells, I recommend unplugging their electronic candle/air freshener/smelly thingy as soon as you walk in. Our room had an EXTREME odor of...almost a mix of baby powder and cologne. I don't know. It was pretty unpleasant, but went away with time.  BUT, that aside, our room was cute!!!! Retro mixed with modern mixed with clean mixed with funky accents and decor and a REALLY comfy bed.  To be honest, I think the price is a little steep. $198 in total (including taxes, fees, etc.) BUT hey. If you're not going to splurge on your 30th birthday, when the hell would you? The friendliness of all the staff, the amazing views on the rooftop patio (We hung out there both at sunset and after we came back from dinner) and...did I mention FREE SNACKS AND DRINKS at the front desk? Those all made for a really fun start of a new decade!

Looking over the 108 reviews for Philadelphia Sandwich Company, I look to be one of about 8 people who have ever eaten these sammies sober. Fear not, boozy-memoried friends! Your taste buds weren't just wearing beer goggles; these sandwiches are DELICIOUS!  It was late. Like, I-took-a-nap-way-too-late-and-now-it's-11:45-and-I'm-starving late. I had no plans of going out but I had NOTHING in my fridge. We're talking a half block of cheddar, some tahini and 3 eggs. Blast. I quickly Yelp'd up "24 hour delivery" in my zip code and up popped this place. Duh! I proudly admit sandwiches are my favorite food group and I'd had this place on the backburner for a while. And they deliver until 1:00 a.m. YES.  Minus a star because the girl answering the phone was a little short. However, I can kind of overlook this because I can ONLY imagine the drunk idiots she puts up with on a daily basis. Still, let me prove I'm coherent! I wasn't sure if they had a delivery minimum plus I'd eaten next to nothing all day so I went with an order of fried mushrooms and the 9th street sandwich, which is roasted red peppers, garlicky spinach and provolone. Would I like to add grilled onions? Why yes I would!  The girl said it'd be about an hour but I got a call from the delivery boy (seriously, he couldn't have been more then 17) 40 minutes later. Bonus? He knew the code to my apartment's gate, which I'd never gotten. Ha! Extra tip to him.  I felt like it was Christmas as I teared into the bag. First of all. That sandwich? HUGE. HUMONGOUS. INSANE. Like I said, I am a sandwich connoisseur and am generally happy to stuff myself beyond comfort when eating them. However, I didn't even try with this bad boy. The bread was soft and warm and fresh, and spinach had TONS of sauteed garlic (score, for me anyway) and it was just overall a delight. I was so happy to have the 2nd half as dinner last night. The fried mushrooms were delicious--a generous amount with lots of tasty italian seasonings in the batter. However, this is definitely an "eat there" kind of thing, but even with the delivery time they were still semi-crunchy and delicious. They also came with 2 complimentary ramekins of ranch, which I promptly threw away. Because, barf. Still, if that's your thing, go for it.  Anyway, this place made my night. I'm so glad I live within a short distance and short delivery wait time. Philadelphia Sandwich Co gets a sober approval!

QUINTON'S IN THE DESERT!!!!!!  Sorry to burst your bubble, Tempe and Tucson, but I was introduced to this tasty sandwich steez in heaven on earth, Lawrence, KS. HOME OF THE JAYHAWKS!!!  Don't believe me? Check it: http://www.quintons.com/lawrence-ks-menu/  I forget how I stumbled upon this  menu on Yelp, but I nearly Yelped in my pants when I saw the menu. The gentleman and I were both of work this past sunny Wednesday afternoon and I decided delicious sandwiches and college memories were in order.  God, you guys. It is still so delicious. And HUGE. The bread is insane. I absolutely love the veggie sandwich's combo of cheeses, avocado, sprouts and other assorted good stuff. (Minus the cream cheese and ago, der.) It tastes of undergrad perfection!  Our server was a cute little 22 year old who was super nice and laid back in a hippie-dippie kind of way. We left oh-so-full and happy. We'll be back, southwest Q's!!

More like Do-press-Zo.  So, I was exhausted last night. I'd worked all day and generally wanted to pass out at soon as I walked through my door. My fridge is always in a general state of empty lately so I took to trusty ol' Yelp and immediately decided I wanted sushi.  I spied Dozo and got excited at how it was about 1.4 seconds away from my place. I rang in my order of an assorted veggie roll, avocado roll, seaweed salad and fried tofu. Yes, it was a metric shit-ton of food but I figured I'd probably have a few leftovers and make a tasty tried tofu/salad concoction today for lunch or something. The whole shebang, including tip because I'm not an asshole and yes, take-out orders should get tipped, set me back $22.  Everything was boxed up and ready to go as soon as I walked in and I ravenously went through the styrofoam (boo) containers once I was back in my kitchen. My first thought upon opening the seaweed salad box: "I paid $4 for THAT?!" There was less than half a cup of the stuff thrown into the box. Second thought: "There is nothing of that color in nature." It was BRIGHT, ELECTRIC bluey-greeny. It was kind of breathtaking, to be honest. I have a personal rule that I don't eat any blue food because it simply doesn't naturally exist (even blueberries are purple) and this was just...I've used more natural-colored toothpaste, let's put it that way. The taste was fine; it was definitely not good enough or enough food to warrant $4. It was almost laughable.  I've been spoiled by Blue Koi in Kansas City's fried tofu and their amaze-delish, cliantro-laden thai chili awesome sauce...silly me expected something of that caliber. Nope. The slabs of tofu were barely fried and bland...this is why people hate tofu. They think it all tastes like this. I ate not even half the amount because...why waste the calories?  The avocado and veggie rolls were slapped together haphazardly...At only $4.00 and $4.50 I didn't expect pristine sushi construction and huge portions but...the size of each piece of avocado roll was that of a thimble. And they fell apart upon chopstick pick up. To their credit, the veggies were freshfreshfresh and delicious. The wasabi? I'm not sure if it was old or WHAT but it was MILD. I wanted something, anything to pep up the plate of food in front of me. At least the ginger was fresh?    Weak sauce, Dozo.

There is NOTHING else I could ever ask for in a gym. I'm sitting here trying to rack my brain for something that would make this place better and am drawing a blank. Maybe if they paid me to work out? That's basically the only thing that could make it better.  The space is stunning. And CLEAN. The locker room is like I'm getting ready in my own home. There are tons of showers (with soap, shampoo, conditioner, shaving gel, razors), several rows of mirrors and sink space, blow dryers and curling irons, hair accessories, bzillions of towels, a little area to sit and watch TV, etc. I've not worked out here before work, but I can only imagine it's not much harder than getting ready at home.  The workout space itself is practically perfect. Rows of every type of elliptical and treadmill and any other workout machine you could think of. There are tons of TVs either in front of your machine or on the wall. All the weights (both free weights and machines) are on the first floor, along with any type of accessory you could need.  The "mind body" studio where the yoga classes are held is simply gorgeous with it's starry-night lit-up ceiling and calming, warm atmosphere. Protip: when you want to attend a class that is marked as reservation only, call a day ahead and make sure to pick up your number at the front desk when you arrive. If you attend barre class, you will have to fight me to a good spot ;) Come early!  Every staff members I've come into contact with is polite and courteous and very willing to go out of their way for every member. Every detail, down to the ice and water machines and free coffee shows that members are the focus here. I really love being a member here.

I like how everyone leaving raving reviews for this place is all "I know, 5 stars for a post office, wtf?!" BUT! This P.O. earns every star!  Friendly staff! Hardly any wait! I finally (whoops) mailed out my Christmas gifts yesterday afternoon, and even at 12:30ish when the line was snaking around the whole room, I only waited 10-15 minutes. In and out!  They are fully stocked on regular envelopes and boxes, those flat rate shipping products, fancy and fun holiday and birthday accoutrements, etc. etc. etc.   Like everyone says, the thing that makes this location is the staff. They know what the heck they're doing, and they do it well. I know serving up quality customer service can be a bitch sometime--ESPECIALLY during the holidays. I can't even imagine working for the postal system this time of year, but they are pros!

I suppose I hold warm fuzzy memories of Cantina Laredo because it's the first real dinner date I had with the boyfran, but I think I'd love this place regardless. It's more fancy than your average, run of the mill, drench everything in queso dip, Americanized Mexican place. (Not that there's anything wrong with places like that. Heck no.) It IS a chain, albeit a small and tasteful one, rather than an On The Border-esque clusterfuck.  I ordered the enchiladas de avocado and booooy howdy were they delicious! Served over sautéed spinach and bursting with avocado and artichokes, they were an awesome veggie entree. The tomatillo sauce covering them was divine, but unfortunately there was a sour cream drizzle (not described on the menu) that I had to scrape off (sour cream = barf) thus removing lots of the sauce. Wah!  Our server was kind of crazy town and spastic, but overall it was an awesome experience. We'll be back!

Quickie:  Boyfriend and I picked up a "Mama Spinato's 'Signature' Fresh Spinach" pie and a Greek salad on Friday.   As soon as we got home we opened the pizza box lid and each grabbed a slice. One bite in we each explained "HOW HAVE WE NEVER EATEN THIS BEFORE?!?!?!"  My car smelled like garlic for 3 days after. WORTH IT.

Dear Target of Fountain Hills,  You suck. Big time.  I have been living in AZ 22 days and have gone to this Target 4 times. Once was with my mom, and she was footing the bill and we were in and out so I didn't really pay attention. But the other times? TURRBLE, as Sir Barkley would say.  I haven't been to a Target this picked over and desolate since living in a college town. And this is Fountain Hills, not Lawrence, KS with 30,000 extra students running around. I came here because I just got a job (finally!) and needed to buy black pants, shirts and shoes. The clothes were fine (not that there was a fitting room attendant to speak of) but the shoe selection was just LAUGHABLE.   Another thing? Every person who works here is a straight up, for lack of a more eloquent term, dick to me. Every time I check out, there is no eye contact, no smile, grumpy/angry demeanor...It's like I'm putting them out. What did I do?! I realize I am not the standard 70+ year old retiree of FH but I'm not a piece of trash! Sweet Jesus!  Aaaaand another thing, and I know this isn't Target's fault, but there always seems to be a surplus of tween-aged kids running around here like banshees. What the F gives with that?  In summary, they get 2 stars for not being Wal-Mart. Yeesh.

I had no idea of where to start when looking for DJ services for my wedding. SKM was the first and only company we met with. They hooked us as soon as we had our initial meeting with them!  I tried to research what the average cost for a wedding DJ in the area is, and to be honest, SKM was a little more pricey than my initial thought. However, we absolutely made room for them in our budget once we met with them and saw how AWESOME they are. Each of their DJ's go through a training process and aren't even allowed to take on an event until they pass. We were set up with an online planner to fill out music for the entire night. (Awesome when I was saving tons of random songs as they popped up on the radio during my year of planning.) We even decided to add a photobooth at the last minute and it was perfect and hilarious.  We met with our DJ Kevin a few weeks before the wedding and he was, in a word, glorious. He made me feel so at ease and I knew we wouldn't have to worry about anything on our night. I had so many people comment an how awesome he was, and already referred him and SKM to the events team at my work.  Planning, communication, day-of, billing, etc. ALL aspects of working with SKM were so easy and professional. If you are planning a wedding, GO WITH THEM!

I loved my gym in KC. L.O.V.E.D. It was affordable, RIGHT across the street, had classes I liked, was clean, etc. etc. etc. I was so worried I'd never find a gym love again.  I was wrong! And in North Scottsdale!?   (Sure, there are Real Housewives of Sdale, meat heads and a few walking eating disorders that clearly need an intervention..but not many!)  El boyfriendo has been a member of this gym for YEARS. That alone made me give it a shot. I unfairly had a preconceived notion that Gold's = dark weight rooms aaaaand that's it. So not true!  The place is big. Tons of cardio machines (tradmills, ellipticals, stair climbers), tons of weight machines, a separate women's only section for big babies like myself who don't wanna lift weights around Ahnold, etc. There is a spinning room (classes are always full), another class room for Zumba, yoga, body pump, etc. and a theatre set with cardio machines if you want to watch a movie while you sweat. Sweet!  I'm on the $19.95/month plan, which gets me into all the classes, and I can bring a guest whenever I want. Sadly, their class schedule really doesn't work for me, so I'm thinking I'm just going to drop down to the $9.95 plan with just the basic gym.  Still a great deal for the amenities, the quality and cleanliness of the gym and the area. AND it's 24 hours! What else could you need!?

Nick's saved the day before baby Jesus's birthday!  We'd had a leisurely xmas eve full of working out, breakfast tacos and going to the movies. Suddenly, it was that late-afternoon/early-evening time (around 4:45-5:00) and we found hanger levels quickly approaching. We had planned for  a Christmas Eve feast at Oregano's like last year, but those assholes decided to give their employees an extra holiday day off. What is this, communist Russia?  So we drove aimlessly and tried to figure out who the heck was open on December 24. As we rounded the bend of FLLW Blvd. I remembered my old coworkers used to love coming to Nick's for their lunch special, and that we were in close proximity of the place. Boyfriend gave them a quick call to see if they would be open and sure enough, they would be until 9:00 p.m. DONE.  We were one of only about three other tables in the place when we got there, but like I said it was a weird "very early-bird diner" time. Had we eaten at a regular time, we'd have to wait, as I saw each and every table fill up in our time dining (and a line forming!--make a reservation if you want to eat at a "normal" dinner time.)  We split lots of things, because hey, holidays, fat, lazy, etc. We started with the bread basket, using the garlic and rosemary (!!) infused olive oil on the table for dipping. I could have made a meal out of the garlic knots in the basket and that godly oil. Perfection. Next was the bruschetta, because carbs are what baby Jesus wants us to eat. Their version uses tomato, onion, capers, black olives and with a shake of parm and a drizzle of aforementioned EVOO, it was outstanding.  We decided to be bad and each order a pasta dish, plus a small Mediterranean pizza. I KNOW. WHO CARES. I'M WORKING OUT LOTS LATELY. I opted for the penne carciofi, which had an abundant amount of artichoke chunks dispersed throughout the pasta, all covered in a bright, lemony white wine sauce. It was absolutely delicious, and when the sauce was scooped up with the bread? DONE. BF got the fettuccine with homemade sausage that came with peppers, onions and a marinara/wine sauce and said it was outstanding. The Med pizza had all the standards: kalamatas, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, arti's, feta. It was tasty, don't get me wrong--but to be honest, the pasta was the star of the show. We both said that we need to come back to try EVERYTHING on the menu. The only thing I would have liked more was an offer for cracked black pepper and crushed red pepper , but to be honest, we were so busy hoovering our food that we didn't even ask for these...I'm sure they are available.  Service was good. I don't know why but I was absolutely chugging water that evening, which I try not to do in restaurants, but both our server and the busser/food runner were quick with refills. Our server's name was Tony and he looked like a tiny Soprano's extra. Glorious. Like I said, the place was absolutely packed when we left, so Nick's knows what they are doing. We will soon be part of the wait crowd!

This place is pretty much an abortion. I've been here twice now, once for a quick coffee stop (mediocre coffee), once for lunch today. What's up with them basically whispering your name when your order is ready?  The highlight of my meal (which was actually made correctly, but I had to confirm that my order had chips...they were about to let me pay almost $9 for a veggie sandwich and not take a side) was watching a guy stroke out on a manger after basically everything in his order was wrong.  Word to the wise, you have to know the menu and pricing system better than the staff here.

Tiny tacos. Delicious, delicious tiny tacos. That's all you need to know!   We were starved for food, and Mexican sounded amazing. A quick Yearch (Yelp search, eh? Eh?) brought this place up...right down the street! Sold!  Our server was super friendly and knowledgable about the menu, if not a *little* absent. It's a good thing we weren't in a rush. We passed the time by watching the Denver Tebows implode so all was well.   I opted for the 2 taco meal, where you chose from a list of about 15 types of street tacos and rice and beans. I love that you get the option of corn or flour tortillas and black or refried beans. I got a mixed veggie taco and a Pappas con Queso taco. Both were delicious and the black beans were super tasty as well. The regular salsa was pretty standard (but good) and the tomatilla salsa was smoky perfection. (Chips and salsa don't come automatically--but are free if you ask!)  All in all, I'm SO glad I know about Cien Agaves! It wil become a staple!

We've been to Cien countless times since my initial review of the place over three (!) years ago. Food is always consistently good and service can usually handle any issue/crowds. We dropped by last spring during a gigantic street fest and even though we were wedged in a corner on their top floor, we still received food and drinks with prompt service.  BUT, what gave me pause on our most recent trip is a new addition to their menu: BOWLS. ("bowls, bowls, all types of bowls...chips and mints and seashell bowls")   More specifically: The Beats by Cien (cute) bowl. You guys, this is a freaking treat, and one you wouldn't expect to stumble upon in a little taco shack in Old Town: roasted red and gold beets, grape tomatoes, grilled corn and chimichurri are all mashed around in some avocado and served upon a bed of shaved sauteed-warm Brussels and dried cranberries. The flavors and textures are outstanding. I think my beloved papas con queso tacos have competition in my heart, and it's this meal.

This was great--and HUGE! By far, the largest arts festival I've ever been to.   What I liked about the Tempe Arts Festival was the variety of artists booths. I'm sorry, but Native American jewelry (TURQUOISE GALORE!) can kind of dominate at festivals out here in the desert. Not here! Jewelry, art (modern, weird, beautiful, print, mixed media everything in between), photography, sculpture, music, clothing tiny fashion hats for dogs?, food and drinks all mixed into a sprawling fest up and down Mill--and on the in-between streets as well. We couldn't believe how it kept going!  Minor complaint: I wasn't eating, but I think a bigger variety of food vendors would be appreciated. How many cinnamon nut tents do we need?!  I think because the tents were so sprawled out, the massive crowd never felt overwhelming or stagnant. Parking wasn't much of an issue, and when we tried to get into a lot that was full, the attendant directed us to one of the parking garages. We spent about 2 hours there for only $1.50 in parking. Glorious, City of Tempe!  Dogs were welcomed, and everyone's pooches were so well-behaved. Not work of the fest, I know, but awesome! We'll definitely make this event a staple!

Yo Pauly's is so. le. git. A solid Pizza Friday (or any day) choice!  They're always super friendly when on the phone and when we go to pickup (haven't dined in yet--it's right down the street and I prefer yoga pants in my living room when I'm drowning myself in pizza and wine after a long week.) and the food is FANTASTIC.  We've only had three things on the menu, but those three things keep us ordering the same over and over again: Margarita Village pizza (charred crust, perfect toppings), Jimmy the Greek salad (perfect combo; but be warned: a small size is ENOUGH for 2 people.), and garlic knots (perfect little bites of garlicky goodness with super tasty marinara for dipping.) Not going to lie: the leftover pizza is just as amazing cold the next day as it is fresh out of the oven. Get on it.  So happy to live in close vicinity to Yo Pauly's!

We toured Queen Creek Olive Mill over Labor Day weekend. While I almost always stop into the QCOM store when I'm shopping at Kierland, we thought this would be a fun quick day trip and a chance to do a little "tourist in my own town" type of activity.  We got in a little early for our tour time, so we paid for our tickets (only $5!) and relaxed on their expansive back lawn with some delicious iced coffees. The grounds are beautiful. There were Bags board set out, and plenty of tables to spread out on.   Our tour began on time, and it was just us and one other couple. Even though the mill only harvests during October, it was still really interested to walk around the grounds with our guide and then into the back room to see how exactly the olives are pressed and made into oil. I am for sure calling them up next month to see the gigantic Olivetron 5 Million (or whatever it was called) in action! Our guide was incredibly well-versed in the entire process and answered all our questions, even though she said she was pretty new to the team. We ended with sampling cupcakes made with their Meyer lemon olive oil. SOLD.  As always, their oils and other sundries are delicious and top notch. You can sample EVERYTHING. I even tried a chocolate olive oil which I was dubious of, but it was surprisingly delicious and I can only imagine what depth it would add to brownies! We ended up taking home some pasta, truffled pasta sauce and their "Robust" olive oil to make dinner that night. This is a great day trip destination!

Come.  TheF.  On.  Very surprisingly, I hadn't heard of Sweet Republic until I moved in basically right behind the store. It was a sweltering summer afternoon, I wasn't working, and I spied ice cream. I was dubious at the amount I was paying for a scoop of espresso, but I tried it out.  HOLY.  Since then, we've become ultimate fans. I know, duh, Food Network, countless local awards and 325 reviews, almost all glowing, can't be wrong. Brave the line--it's worth it.  Flavors we've had:  Espresso: Pure coffee flavor, with a chocolatey kick. Perfection. Buzzbuzz.  Real Mint Chip: They ask you if you've had it before, because it's natural, real mint goodness and some fat 'murcans have a dumbed down palate. Refreshing amaze-mint. (Get it?!?!?!)  Maple Pecan: Boyfriend's favorite. Chunks of pecans in sweet, sweet mapley goodness. He likes it more than he likes me. I bought a pint for him when he was sick and it immediately healed. True story.  Pumpkin Spice: You don't need pie anymore, or a PSL from Starby's. Get thee to SR for this holiday TREATACULAR.  Horchata: I know what you're thinking...well, maybe you're not thinking, because your brain just exploded in cinnamony goodness just trying to figure out how delicious this could be. Hint: it's BETTER THAN THAT.  Brownie Swirl: Chocolate Explosion. Enough.  I've also sampled a wide variety; the Earl Gray sticks out in my mind for being so unique.  The waffle cones and bowls are made fresh and if you just want to throw all caloric issues aside, get 2 scoops in a bowl and call it a crisp-ity, crunch-ity day. I like to break off lil pieces of it and use it as a "chip" for ice cream "dip." I'm also fat. You can be fat with me, if you indulge here. WORTH IT.

Humble Pie is absolutely, stupidly delicious.  We came here for lunch on Memorial Day, after seeing it a few weekends ago while we brunched at Tryst. All the patio/bar doors were wide open and we had a view of the giant wood-burning pizza oven.  We decided to be fat (Hey, it was a holiday! MERCA!) and ordered the fries as an appetizer. Holy. The crispy, not-too-fat, not-too-thin pile of fries (Looks can be deceiving: The bowl they came in hid about half the order. So much.) were tossed in AMPLE amounts of Parmesan, red pepper flakes, parsley and lemon zest. I honestly could have made a meal out of the fries and left a happy camper.  But of course we didn't. PIZZA! Continuing the fat theme, we shared two pies: The artichoke was covered with juicy 'chokes, caramelized onions, various diced olives and ricotta. The contrasting mellow ricotta versus the tangy-salty olives and artichokes was delicious.  The potato and roasted garlic pizza was just straight up unnecessary. I mean that in the best way possible. The combo of potatoes and rosemary is just a tasty classic, while the Gorgonzola added a perfect POW (To be honest, I would have liked a slightly stronger Gorgonzola choice, but I know not everyone shares my sentiment). I would have liked the potatoes to be a teeeeeensy little bit more done/crispy, but that's really the only "complaint" I had, if you can even call it that.  The crust on the pizzas was absolutely sublime. Charred underneath, flaky and crispy and almost...buttery? DIVINE.   All in all, I can't wait to come back to Humble Pie. We need to try so many more of their pizzas! And their fries...once I get to the gym 84 more times.

Love the Green Belt! I've now lived on the very north end as well as the south end, and it's such a perfect trail for bike riding, running, or just a long walk.  On a personal, quirky note, I love that there are lots of "landmarks" I can use while running. You know, "Just make it to that bench and you can take a walk break" or "OK we're gonna sprint until the end of that overpass!" Sounds hokey but it makes me run longer and harder! Big points for a small time runner.  There is definitely lots of traffic all throughout the trail, so stay aware of what's around you (don't blast the iPod up to 11) and stay on the right side of the path so you aren't run over by bikes (or roller blading moms with strollers).   The only negative I've ever found is that after a rain (or after the sprinklers come on), some parts can get muddy and smelly. But those spots are few and far between. I feel super luck to live right on the Green Belt. A desert gem for sure!

I don't like to make it a habit to eat a ton of sweets (if my fiance ever reads this he's going to LOL in real life.) but when the mood strikes, I prefer to get my sugar high at Yogurtology. It is a fine, fine establishment.  First, I love how they're super open to giving you samples, but that THEY control the samples. No grubby hands anywhere. I think my all-time favorite yogurt flavor is the Golden Cupcake Batter.  As most people have said, the toppings selection here is CHOICE. You start out with "healthy" toppings (fruit, fruit sauce, granola), wander into the chocolate wonderland (my weapon of choice), head through some crunchy toppings (crushed candy bars, graham cracker dust, etc.) and wind up in fruity/gummy/marshmallow land. Not only are there a TON of options, but there are just ridiculous choices, like whole mini chocolate donuts, fudge-dipped Oreos, entire Kit Kat bars, etc. What makes me love it is that it's ALWAYS clean. I'm sure the employees here are constantly wiping up after sticky kids and clumsy adults (me) who spill all over the place. It is so, so appreciated.  It's a little pricey...but to be honest, if I quit piling on the toppings I could probably spare a few bucks. So good!

Now that temps are strictly in the 105+ range, we've been trying to figure out weekend activities that keep us cool. We both hate wasting the weekend away at home with the TV, so I'm always searching out events, happenings and yep, museums, that provide us with both entertainment and heat oasis.  Our first impression of the Museum of the West was that is just simply looked AWESOME. Before headed in, we marched around the outside looking at sculptures and admiring the landscaping. It's just a unique space and very well-done. The inside provides more of the same. I thought the $13 admission per adult was fair.  The place is beautiful inside, and it's just coolto see a museum in it's first few months of opening. The Lewis and Clark exhibit was really interesting, and winding our way through the other rooms was an entertaining way to spend an afternoon. I loved the collection of historical rodeo memorabilia, and the gun/spur/saddle collections are neat. The small sculpture garden area in the middle of the first floor was worth a walk-around, even in the summer. Also, don't miss the "optical illusion" piece as well as a photo-op with a giant bison right by the gift store.  All in all, this was a fun way to spend a few hours without melting!

Short and sweet--I had a minor skin problem that turned into a gigantic annoyance/pain. Incessant itching to the point of me breaking the skin. My legs looked like battlegrounds from my claws :( Boyfriend all but forced me to head to a derm. I'm glad I finally took the leap, because I was quite miserable.  I, like many other reviews it seems, saw Mike Richards. The assistant that came in before him was so completely pleasant and nice, and she stuck around to take notes while he examined me as well. He immediately figured out what I should do (I'd developed a random form of eczema that wasn't visible to the eye but left me miserable), had her write me a Rx for medicine and since I first applied it the next night, I've been 100% cured.   They insisted I schedule a followup appointment for a month later in case I needed anything, and said I was free to cancel it if my problem vanished like they said it would. Just called two days ago to happily cancel it. Quality of life: Plus 48302 happy points!

It's still weeks away from when Lisa will get our wedding pictures delivered, but I am already incredibly content with giving her 5 stars.  I can't tell you how many compliments I've received on our engagement session pictures (included in our package!), and I'm dying to see the magic she works on our day-of pics. Lisa is so friendly and open to everything! She went with us to a few locations for our engagement pictures, and was even a little early to my hotel the day of my wedding. She took notes from our very initial meeting and remembered things I loved about my friend's wedding pictures and shots I was hoping to get for my own day.  To be honest, I think the quality of her work is a STEAL for her prices. I will absolutely work with her for any other photo needs I have in the future!

We joined Mountainside Fitness since we moved farther away from the Gold's-turned-EOS we'd been members of for a few years. The cost is a bit more, but the amenities are clearly on a nicer level.  Enrollment was easy and when we both turned down their complimentary personal training session that comes with each membership, we weren't pressured about it. I've never had any issue with any of the cardio machines. (And I see people wipe down their machines all the time--not sure what the review stating differently is about.)  There are a ton of weight machines and free weights. I've never had any problem finding space to do my workouts or find the right weights. Everyone is pretty conscious to re-rack and put their dumbbells in the proper place, which is EONS better than the crowd at Gold's/EOS.  I've taken some Power Yoga classes, and their yoga studio is much nicer than I expected from a non-yoga studio. I don't love that there's a random wall right in the middle of the room, but I guess it doesn't affect the classes. The class itself is awesome for a workout, but there's not much of the hippy-dippy, introspective Namaste vibe that made me fall in love with yoga. Still, if you want to sweat, it's perfect.  The locker rooms look really nice (haven't actually used them yet since we live so close), and the cafe/smoothie area seems well stocked. And there's free coffee in the morning! So, on a scale of my now-defunct Golds/EOS membership and my current membership to the Village Health Clubs and Spas, I'd say Mountainside is a perfect match in-between the two levels.

OK. So in Yelp terms, 2 stars is "Meh. I've experienced better" and yes...I've experienced better.  Sure, DD is a chain but it has damn good iced coffee. Not as great as my obsession, Black Cat in Arcadia, but it's not the burnt swill 'Bucks peddles. (Hey, I love me some afternoon wi-fi stealing at Starbucks, but admit it. Their burnt coffee is not that great.)  What kills me about this DD location are the dips who work the drive-thru. I don't understand why it's so HARD! Granted, I've never worked in fast food but I really don't think 2 medium iced coffees (the only thing we've ever ordered) should be confusing. TWICE the person working (2 separate girls) asked my boyfriend if by "light cream" he meant a lot of cream or almost no cream?   "So...light on the cream. Do you mean you want us to put a lot in there, or not a lot?" I just...Wait. What? HOW do you not know this?  Last time we went, they said back "OK 2 iced coffees" then had only one ready. Where did the breakdown in communication happen?   I'm sure we'll go back because, like I said, DD coffee is pretty delish. But man. Meh. I've experienced better.

We were headed to Chandler's mall and thus, decided to try a place for breakfast that we'd never heard of, since we're in the area about 3 times a year. A Yelp search brought up Yoli's Cafe with it's 4 start average out of 101 reviews. Looked unique, kitschy and in the general area of where we were going. Done!  There was a short wait and a bit of miscommunication when we were sat and waited semi-long for coffee. However, I have a soft spot for people in the service industry working breakfast. It's such a bumbling rush for a few short hours and lots of people are angry jerks who pound gallons of coffee. (How is it possible for some people to CHUG boiling hot coffee?)   Once that was all rectified we ordered our breakfast and seriously waited about 4 minutes before it arrived. AWESOME. I got a breakfast sandwich on an Everything bagel (warm, chewy and toasty. Delicious.) with egg whites, mushrooms, spinach and subbed cheddar/jack for the Havarti. It was one of the most perfect breakfast sammies I've ever had--and I'm a connoisseur. Boyfriend ordered the veggie omelet which was STUFFED! with veggies and came with really tasty hash browns and some toast. They brought out sides of homemade hot sauce and verde sauce on his requst. The verde was cilantro magic. I wish I could buy a gallon.  To-go coffee was offered by our sweet server and all said, breakfast was $18. Come on! Oh how I wish Yoli's was closer to home.

We came here for breakfast this past Saturday after my boyfriend stopped in for lunch on Friday afternoon. He said he had an amazing pulled pork sammie and sweet pot tots, and this place had been on our" weekend breakfast out" radar for a while, so we stopped in.  We got there around 9:30 and had a short (less than 5 minutes) wait. There were a few tables open, but I honestly appreciate places that don't overwhelm their staff by rapidly seating all their tables. It makes for a much easier experience. The patio was packed and there was a giant table of about 10 ladies having a pre-Mother's Day gathering, so I can understand why staff might have been busy. We were sat in kind of a precarious location between two parties right in the partition between the inside and patio, but hey, it was a table.  My iced coffee was delicious, and our server was very quick with refills for both iced and regular coffee for the bf. We both ordered the Tryst omelet (which seemed popular--I heard the ladies at the table next to us order it.) which is filled with fresh mozz, roasted tomatoes and pesto. He kept the sweet potato tots, I subbed fruit for mine. (I'd just ran for 31 minutes straight, I needed to pretend to be healthy.)  The omelets were stuffed and delicious. The mozz could have been just an eensie bit more melted but the roasted tomatoes were stupid good! The lil fruit cup was tasty, with fresh orange segments (juicy!), pineapple, honeydew and melon. And of course I stole a few tots, which were tasty as expected.  I really liked this place, but the prices seemed a little bit steep for breakfast. However, I definitely want to try dinner and some of their drinks. I like the organic focus that seemed to be throughout all the menus. Tryst was a good change of pace and we'll be back to try new things!

Perfect!  I moved to AZ in May of 2011 (HOW has it been five years...HOW?!) and immediately got to work stalking Yelp and putting together a list of must-go-tos in my new town. Citizen Public House has always been on that list, but I'm an idiot and just never got around to heading there until this past weekend. It was so phenomenal that I'm kicking myself for waiting so long to get here!  My friend and I decided Restaurant Week was the perfect opportunity for our inaugural visit. Our server was Kent, and he was fantastic. Hilarious, knowledgeable about the menu, and just all around gave amazing service. Good service is very surprisingly hard to find in a metro area with a bzillion restaurants, and he was great. We ordered a bottle of Prosecco to split, because obviously, and got to eating!  I started with the roasted beet salad, which I was told they were testing out to see if they want to put on the regular menu. Dear CPH: YES PLEASE. The combo of the sweet roasted beets, goat cheese, tomatoes, frisee, and arugula pesto was such a refreshing way to start a summer meal. For my entree I chose the Chicken "Caesar." Guys, I know chicken can be "boring," but I didn't eat meat for almost 11 years and now really only eat chicken or turkey. This was OUTSTANDING. The chicken breast was so juicy and tender and perfectly grilled. It came served with grilled radicchio, a cauliflower puree, some ciabatta croutons and a soft boiled egg half. It was an amazing combination of summery flavors and textures. Try as I might, I couldn't finish it all...but I COULD order dessert! The Black and Tan chocolate pot de creme was layered with salted carmel pudding (I know.) and came served with a browned butter shortbread cookie. Repeat: browned butter shortbread cookie. That's all you need to know.  All in all, our evening was glorious. I will say, the next time I visit (AND THERE WILL BE MANY MORE NEXT TIMES) I might request to sit on the small patio, as it got pretty loud inside the dining room. Other than that...CPH, you are ACES!

This place. What more do I say?  We were quoted 20-25 minutes to wait...we mosied on outside (pretty much zero space to wait inside) and sat on a lone bench...only to have our buzzer immediately go off. Kind of annoying, but I was just happy to get to brunchin'.  The space is clean and modern and just...not what I was expecting. I loved it. Tables were a little cramped but I can understand wanting to pack em in. If you build it, eaters will come!  Iced coffee was delish, and refills came without asking. I settled on a breakfast sammie of a soft, chewy bagel (hate when sandwich bagels are gigantic and hard. Not great when sandwich filling starts flying everywhere!) with over hard eggs, cheddar and I subbed avocado instead of bacon. TREAT CITY. My side of fruit was awesome as well: berries, pineapple, melly and oranges. It was a colorful, pretty accompaniment to my fat kid main dish.  Boyfriend got a MONSTROUS Mexicanish omelet filled with chorizo, jalapeño cheese (awesome that this is a choice for cheese), veggies and topped with a green chile sauce. Wonderment. Holy. I triied a bite (or 3. Or 4.) of his perfectly outside-crispy, inside-fluffy hash browns with the sauce and almost died.  Service was quick and friendly. I promptly went home and napped HARD. The sign of a glorious meal!

Since I'm living on a shoestring budget I actually go through all those ridiculous Val-U-Pak coupon mailings that come out every few weeks. One of the few coupons I kept was for this place. A pedicure, manicure and eyebrow wax for $33? I'm not one to spring for a manicure, since the ol' service industry has me washing my hands approximately 5850382 times a day and polish jobs usually last a millisecond. Add that to a few 12+ hour days on my aching feet (blech) and I couldn't pass up this deal. Done and done!  The space is CLEAN, but not uninviting or sterile. No knick-knacks and tchotchkes collecting dust around weirdo lotions that are never going to be sold like in a lot of nail places. There was a wide range of OPI colors and some Orly (ORLY?!) polish as well.  Each pedicure bath is fitted with these disposable plastic bins that are disposed of between each person. Awesome for germophobes, bad for mutha erf. We'll call it even. The massage chairs are AMAZING. I honestly have never had a chair massage like this one. I had it zone in on my lower back, which has been hurting lately and it actually did some work. I know.   If I had to use one word to describe the word of the nail technicians here, it is THOROUGH. I don't I've ever received longer foot and hand/arm massages (that actually feel nice instead of all wimpy) during mani-pedi time then here. Both polish jobs were meticulous and perfect. And my girl was super nice to boot.  The brow job was great as well. I'm one of those girls who goes weeks and weeks in between waxes and everything is fine and then one day...Horror! So I was glad to take advantage of this service. The wax left me a *leetle* red, and I'm not one to be sensitive during eyebrow waxes but this honestly was nothing a little mineral powder couldn't fix.  They accept credit card tips. So convenient.  I have a few more coupons I'm sure I'll use at this place, and after those run out I'm sure I'll still be a dedicated customer!

Dear Black Cat,  Can you pretty, pretty please move to my neighborhood? Or make another location in Scottsdale? I'd just love it. Thanks!  Boyfriend and I happened upon Black Cat a few months ago. We were starving and on our way to a fun- and monkey-filled day at the zoo and tried to stop in at Over Easy. The line was out the door and we were reaching hangry levels. On a whim (like I'm sure a lot of people), we decided to try out luck next door at this cute little coffee house.  HELLO, BREAKFAST SANDWICHES.  Huge, fluffy eggs. Buttery croissants. Thick cut tomatoes. Assorted meats for him. Tasty, gooey cheese for both. Add a huge, slightly chocolatey iced coffee for each of us and it was love at first sight.  We've returned twice since then, the latest being this morning. We just love this place. All employees we've talked to are so nice (the first time we got a punch card, and they gave us double punches. Weeee!) and both food and drink product is so, so stellar. We don't live very close but when we are in the area, Black Cat is IT!

I've decided: Black Cat is the best-kept breakfast secret. Their egg sandwiches (which you can get on a bagel, croissant or in a wrap) are out of this world. You get your choice of breakfast meat, tomato and/or cheese and they are HUGE. Paired with their absolutely delicious iced coffee, I'm not sure why the chumps waiting outside of Over Easy don't just come in here. (More room for us, hooray!!)

Come on! This place is ridiculous!  I used to work at a country club right down the street and spent many an exhausted all-too-short break at the nearby Starbucks. I always thought Lamp's signage was cute and put it on my mental list of places to try.  Last night we decided to try some place new for our *1**year**anniversary* (Aw, a year ago we went on our first date and he thought I hated him the whole time) and Lamp was it. The menu looked tasty...but nothing could prepare me for the ...  CROSTINI. You must get this. You must. Toasty bread (next time I'll ask for a bit more char...I love grill marks on my bread! More flavah!) and onion/cheese-adorned flatbread wedges served along a trio of dips: Herbed Ricotta, White Bean/Roasted Red Pepper and (be still my heart) Rough Chop Pesto. The RCP was a flavor explosion of whole toasted pinenuts, fresh basil (in December? I like AZ), garlic, parm and magic. The herbed ricotta (It looked like a lil scoop of vanilla ice cream!) was a bit bland BUT, when combined with the RCP, it popped! The white bean/roasted red pep stood on it's own as well. This is one of my favorite appetizers of all time, hands down.  But what about the main event, the pizza? Two words: HOLY SAUCE. Both our pies were red sauced (Need to try the white pizza next time!) and it was pretty much a religious experience for me. Sauce was lightly done, as to not overpower anything, but it was SO fresh and homemade tasting. The Grandma had red chiles, onion and provolone (to die) and The Simple was a margherita topped with MOUNDS of arugula and fresh parm shavings with a sprinkling of extra virgin. They were both EXCELLENT.  Our server was sweet and kind of spastic, as we saw her run into about 3-4 tables, chairs, diners, etc. It was kind of funny.   Lamp is absolutely a new go-to! I LOVE LAMP! (Several years late, really cool reference points for me)

Grassroots is by far the best surprise I've ever had. IN LIFE! EVER! Sorry. That's a little dramatic. But I am SO glad I finally stumbled upon this place.  I had some besties in town and we were looking to have a tasty night out to dinner after a vigorous day of hiking, college basketball and patio-hopping. I don't really know how or why I came to the decision of Grassroots, but BOY HOWDY (yep.) am I glad I did!  I used to work right over in this area and put Grassroots on my mental "to-try" list when it opened. Time got away from me, and I really have no idea why we just now tried it out, given how close it is to home. Nothing could prepare me for how glorious it was. Walking in, we were transplanted into someone's hip, modern kitchen with lots of Americana art adorning the sleek space. We were promptly sat at a high-top for 4 and perused the menu. We all ordered a cocktail (or beer) to start with, and my Hendricks/cucumber concoction was cool and refreshing.   Ordered:  ~Burrata app: Heaven. Creamy, dreamy burrata served alongside lightly dressed arugula and tomato jam. Served with lil grilled toasts. So perfect.  ~Seasonal vegetable chop for the table to share: Not sure why, but our order came with chicken on it? At a normal time I'm sure we would have sent back but we had already placed our dinner order and it was getting closer to the kitchen closing. No matter. Those who weren't eating meat just picked around. The plethora of veggies was outstanding! (Beets, grapes, bnut squash, corn, edamame, cucumber, herbs, cherry tomatoes, feta, I'm sure I'm leaving something out.)  My choice as my main was the grilled portobello sandwich, no mayo, add avocado. The combo of smokey porto, creamy avo and sharp, melty white cheddar was outstanding! The soft and warm sea salt foccacia was insanity. Paired with a side of fatty grilled asparagus spears, this meal was amazing. I also loved how they cut the sammie into tiny squares...easier to handle and inhale.  Friends ordered the sashimi ahi salad (was told the ahi was PERFECT and it actually went better with the champagne vin that came out with the chop salad rather than the miso vin), the vegetable platter (the sauteed cabbage with goat cheese was TO DIE) and my boyfriend said his burger was one of the most perfect orders ever.  With the meal, we ordered a bottle of the Rockus Bockus, which is a mix of Cab Franc and Zinfandel and was SO, SO perfect. Juicy, man. It's a new favorite.  Service was great, even though we stayed a little past closing. Whoops. (PLEASE SCOTTSDALE, HAVE SOME NICE PLACES LIKE THIS THAT STAY LATER THAN 10:00 ON THE WEEKENDS, PLEASE!) There were several groups still lingering over drinks while we left, which I don't blame them for. What a great place to hang out and enjoy delicious bites. We will be back!

How awesome is this place? First you combine the upscale gas station/carwash along with a modern cafe with a BBQ focus. Add a really unique and thorough collection of gifts, wine, World Market-esque pantry items (Reminded me of a scaled down version of La Grande Orange's selection) and you get Tom's Thumb. The multi-use of gas station/restaurant may scare some people, but I'm from Kansas City, home of the worlds' most notorious BBQ/gas station combo so it ain't no thing.  We've exhausted pretty much all of the decent Scottsdale/North Scottsdale options and were wanting somewhere new-to-us. Enter going to Tom's Thumb on a whim. It's really convenient to us (just right right up the 101 a few minutes) and if every experience is like this weekend, we will be regulars in no time!  The decor in the restaurant seating area is so cute. A chalkboard drawing of a piggie (with various cuts, so mean), a gigantic, twinkling chandelier, a big row of BBQ sauces and condiments...even a doggie friendly patio! We picked up the menu (As the breakfast crowd got larger, servers began to bring people menus...it's seat yourself, at least for breakfast so pick a place you like!) and perused our options.  Even though it's first and foremost a BBQ place, I found perfectly acceptable vegetarian-friendly items (or ones that could easily omit and ingredient to make it OK)...I went with a delicious breakfast sandwich that consisted of a whole wheat English muffin, an over easy egg (will get over hard next time--drippy goodness!), tomato, arugula and cheddar. So simple and perfect! Boyfriend went with a much more substantial and glorious option: Pigs and grits! Crispy pulled pork served over grits with crumbled jalapeno bacon and cheddar. Of course he added the egg option. He said it was outstanding.   The ONLY qualm I had was the servers seemed to get overwhelmed as more and more parties came in. Our food didn't take too long to come out, but several tables seemed to wait quite a long time and I overheard one server apologize profusely for it taking so long for him to take an order. I understand that breakfast can be really hard to predict (big rushes all at once, dead for a while, people chugging coffee and wanting 920 refills, etc.) I can definitely overlook this.  I hope they liked our bright and shining faces, because we will be back!

If this place becomes too big of a deal and I have to start waiting a long time I'm going to...well, I'm going to not be happy.  Tiny ceramic olive dishes! Calligraphy'd menus! A pizza oven that's RIGHT THERE! Dim lighting, a cute little (emphasis on "little") patio, perfect service and THE PIZZA. GAH.  Never mind. I was going to elaborate on the pesto-ridiculousness I've experienced both times we came here, but I don't want to share. Forget you read this. Carry on.

YOU GUYS. Sandwiches are my favorite. No, they aren't fancy and they aren't gourmet (or they try to be gourmet, and they just end up being expensive) but they ARE a cornerstone of my diet. They are life. SANDWICHES FOREVER.  Which Wich is a sandwich paradise. I usually really hate "Build Your Own" options, as I can't make up my mind and end up with a combo that's either underwhelming or just doesn't mesh. For some reason, I felt none of that here. There are ample options, but not a bzillion.  I went with the black bean patty on toasted (duh) wheat with pepper jack (sufficiently melty), red onions, avocado, iceberg, tomatoes, bell peps, black olives and S&P.  IT WAS DELICIOUS. The smallest size is 7 inches, which was more than enough for me.  The avocado costs a dollar extra, but is worth it, as it's actual fresh mashed avos and not that weirdo green dip made up of scary tastes and textures. The black bean patty was really tasty and hearty. The veggies were fresh, although next time I might just skip lettuce, as there was a little too much and it didn't add much. The only thing I wished for was maybe a salsa option as a spread, since I don't think mayo or mustard really go with the flavor profile I put together. I see salsa as an option on their website so maybe I just need to ask. Next time!  I'm eyeballing the hummus option and caprese option for future visits. And there will be many future visits!

On a whim, I bought a 5-pack of classes to Go Figure for $39 from Living Social. This is an amazing deal, considering a regular 5-pack costs $90. I was a little hesitant on my first visit. I used to go to yoga and Pilates (the two workouts I hear Barre compared to regularly) semi often back in KC, but hadn't done either in over two years. Yikes!  All I have to say is, I LOVE Go Figure! It's such an amazing workout and a great way to start my day! I've taken classes from Kelly (the owner...she is amazing), Michelle C., Kara (want to get your butt kicked? Take her Friday 6 a.m. class to get ready for the weekend!) and Kathy. They are all so welcoming and energetic. Each class is a little bit different but works every part of your body in a perfect 60 minutes time frame.  What I also love about Go Figure is that they have everything you could need. The studio is stocked with mats, bands, balls, blocks and small hand weights (of varying weights) that are all used in the various exercises. There is an area with lockers that come with individual keys. Everything is clean, modern and sleek. I've never been pressured to buy more classes, although once my first 5 classes are up, I definitely signed up for a month unlimited--which they awesomely gave me for the new student price! I try to make classes 3-4 times a week, and am excited to already see a difference in the way I can work through each class.  I know trying a new exercise regimen like this may seem daunting. Please give it a try at Go Figure. Everyone is so positive and friendly, and each move in class can be modified for every level. You will love it!

4 star average out of 54 reviews? What could go wrong! UGH.  WTF, Yelp? You are usually spot on, or at least KIND OF in the ballpark when it comes to rating places. I have honestly noidea how Sevens has a 4 star average.  For a small positive, at least the decor is cool. The big garage doors opened onto a large patio, and as other reviews mention, the ambiance is pretty awesome. I loved the big sparkly lamp/light fixture that hung over a tall table in the middle of the dining room. Everything felt modern and sleek. I thought the chalkboard inside the bar area really clashed with the decor...I don't know, spelling out your million fruity martini drinks (Orange Julius? I just got diabetes) doesn't seem so fancy.  The location is weird. This place had to have been a bank in a former life, right? It sits like a giant mansion right on McDowell and 77th, and right besides some SKETCHO hotel. Me: "Who the hell stays at a hotel right here?" Boyfriend: "People making meth." We walked in and, seeing three other tables at 10:00 a.m. on a Sunday in Scottsdale, should have known to just peace out. The first thing I saw was a couple sending back a plate of food. Awesome! It took way too long to be greeted. Our server was nice enough, but it was so obvious he wanted to be ANYWHERE but working. I understand, it's Memorial Day weekend and you're working but man. You just gotta do it sometimes.  The food actually earned the second star. It was pretty tasty. I had the veggie benedict (I loved the tiny knife cuts of assorted veggies--roasted asparagus standing out) and it was tasty, although one of my poached eggs had been pierced and the yolk was all sopped up by the English muffin by the time it arrived to the table. The hash browns were seasoned and delicious. My side of fruit was on the same plate as the hot food--no separate tiny bowl or plate for cold fruit? It was meh--honeydew, melon, watermelon.  BF ordered the "enraged" corned beef hash. Again, he said it was tasty, but not exactly "enraging" (aka, not that spicy) and it came with a uniform square (Kraft single?) of cheese melted on top. Uh?  Protip: They serve bottomless mimosas for $15 until 2:00 p.m. on the weekend. Even if you just want two, get this. Why? Because just one is $10. Made with bottled, concentrated juice and a normal amount of champagne. Really? I can go down the street to Orange Table (leaps and bounds over Sevens, in all aspects) and get a full glass of champagne + St. Germain (their Daybreak drink...delicious) for $7. Give me a break.   Perhaps their 4 star average is based on an amazeballs, 180 degree turn from breakfast dinner and happy hour...but we won't be back to find out.

2 stars for now. I know they just opened but...  First of all, a star for the decor and ambiance. It's so cute and colorful and comfy! We were worried there would be a wait (the place seemed packed) but were able to snag a spacious booth overlooking the kitchen. This may seem like a great idea, but I was able to watch food get sent back (3 different meals in the time we waited for ours) and see how long certain plates were left under hot lamps. Being able to watch the kitchen in action is neat in theory, but if you're well-versed in the ways of restaurant life, you'll catch these problems easily.  Another star for service. Our server was sweet but slow...because I think she was overwhelmed. She would disappear for long stretches (as in, I couldn't find her in the whole place) and it took forever for coffee refills because they were out of glasses. Again, I don't fault her at all. I think that she must have been slammed. Every table in the place was taken.  The food? Well. I ordered the Scottsdale burrito, and subbed cheddar for the goat cheese. Instead, it came with no cheese. The menu promised hash browns inside the burrito...and they were, and they were frozen shreds with no crisp or color to them. They blended in with the egg whites. Dammit.  Boyfriend ordered the Odelay scramble, with a microscopic amount of chorizo. His side of breakfast potatoes was tasty, at least. Why couldn't they put THOSE potatoes in the burrito? Everything was just underwhelming.   The place has a gigantic breakfast and lunch menu...maybe scale back and focus on making a smaller amount of items, but doing them REALLY well? We both agreed we'd give them one more shot if we're in the area and only if there isn't a wait. Otherwise, there are just too many solid breakfast places in Scottsdale.

Yelp, you slacker! You're supposed to let me know when I live in close proximity to the BEST BREAKFAST SAMMIE EVAR. Holy.  So I've only been to MSK once; they hosted a happy hour for my work on my 2nd day on the job. They set up a cute appetizer display in the back section of their dining room and I remember being enamored by the gigantic walls of wine bottles that surrounded us. I wasn't there too long, but I remember the deviled eggs being tasty and the cheese display with crackers being a treat.  Yesterday we decided to make use of an MSK gift card we'd had a while and landed on them for brunch. I'd stalked the menu online as I am wont to do for basically every restaurant and I thought I'd go with the garden omelet. However, I saw another patron on the patio get her breakfast sandwich delivered and KNEW I had to switch up my order. (Aside on the patio: So perfect on a breezy/sunshiney/thank you Jesus not too hot April morning.)  The goods: Grilly-toasty bread, eggs, white cheddar, spinach, diced portobellos, thin spread of fire-roasted tomato goodness. I left the bacon off, boyfriend kept it. SERVED WITH A SIDE OF GARLIC TOTS? SERVED WITH $12 BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS? (We did our best a 4 apiece. Then I took a 2 hour nap.) WHY AM I YELLING? Because it was absolutely glorious. You don't get an option for your side, so you better like tots (who doesn't?) and not try to be healthy with fruit or tomato slices or something.   Service was prompt (he knew the importance of mimosa refills), busser/drink refiller and manager were both friendly and chatty. I'll have dreams about the breakfast sandwich for many moons to come. An all-around great experience.

Hello, would you like to know the secret of life? If you worship at the temple of the almighty carb (which I am wont to do and really need to stop making a habit of), here you go:  Mashed potatoes. Inside an enchilada.  I could basically stop there, because what the hell else do you need to know?! But some more deets:  I ordered 2 enchiladas in their 100% corn tortillas (pressed in front of our own eyeballs!), one filled with the mushroom/spinach mixture, one with the godly mashed potato filling.  I picked "Christmas style" (both red and green sauces) because WHY NOT! Although I am an avid verde lover, so I think I'll go full on green sauce next time.  Asadero cheese.  Pico. Picked red onion.  HEAVEN.  We split some chips/salsa/gaucamole on the side, because you might as well go all out. The food was stupid, in the best way possible. I like a little golden to my cheese (all pizzas/cheese-topped foods in my house get a 30 broiler blast at the last cooking minute), and was pleasantly surprised when my little 'lada bowl came out of their oven just like that. Perfect! The mixture of toppings was superb.  The only recommendation I can give is to perhaps put a label of what's what on the front see-through guard as people order. There are a lot of fillings/toppings/salsas/extras and it was a little awkward to have to step back and look immediately above my head and strain to see all the details of what I could order. If anything, it could make the employees' lives easier.  Last word: Pumpkin cookies. Get them. See how life changes for the better.

This place is pretty dang glorious. As inventor of the world phenomenon "pizza Friday," Giant Rustic Pizza had been on our radar for a while to try out. It's right down the street from us and it promises giant pizza...what's not to like.  Well, the name does not lie. Giant is GIANT. The one minus star I had to give was the last time I ordered in, I clearly said we only wanted the 14 inch pie, not the huge 20 inch. Girl on the phone repeated, 14 inches...we received the house-sized pizza. Not a huge problem, because...I mean, it's a ton of pizza. What a "problem" to have.  I love GRP's large list of ingredients and toppings. Our most recent order had sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms and caramelized onions. Tasty-city! The crust is really the start here. It's *SO* good.  We also always get the California Dreamin' salad. Rolled up deli mozzarella slices, tomatoes, peppers, arti hearts, roasted red peppers and black olives make up a great salad for sharing. Oh, and the BREAD they serve with the salad! So delicious! (and worth it to top your carbs on carbs on carbs.)  Such a great option for take-out pizza!

I don't love giving "meh" reviews, but the customer service I've received in the past few weeks from Neil's has been frustrating.  We're moving and I needed to repair the cabinets in our garage that I managed to run into (Ugh, driving.) a while ago. I took out a chunk of one of the cabinets and after calling around, Neil's seemed to be one of the only companies who actually does repairs on something like this.  I called at the end of September and booked an appointment for a repairman to come out a few weeks later to looked at it, take some measurements, make sure they had a paint match, etc. I was told this consultation would be $65, and that our job total looked like it would be about $255. The repairman was set to come at 1:00 p.m. on a Wednesday afternoon.  I called the day before and was told he'd be there "between 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m." I updated my fiance (he'd be at home at that time)...2:30 p.m. on Wednesday rolled around and fiance let me know no one was there yet. I called Neil's and asked for an update. They said they'd call me back once they got a hold of the repairman. They call back, saying he couldn't find our place on GPS. They said I should call him to give him directions, and gave me the name Rocky along with a phone number. I called. No one answered. I left Rocky a voicemail. I walk into a meeting and a number that ISN'T the number Neil's gave me (i.e., not Rocky) calls and leaves a voicemail. I forward it to my fiance, who calls the guy and gives him directions. He comes out, takes the $65 check I'd left for the consultation, looks over our cabinet and says we'll get an update next week with what the job will cost, when to schedule, etc. Now, I don't really care that the guy couldn't find us on shoddy GPS. Things happen. I DO care that the front office gave me the wrong name and number to call and give him directions.   A week rolls around and I haven't heard back. I call them on Wednesday, so exactly one week from the consultation, and am told since the repairman who came out to us was out of town, they'd have to look through files and give me a call back that afternoon. No call. I call the next day and explain that we're in the process of moving and that I wanted to get this scheduled. Woman I talk to says that since two people are out of town, it's hard to move ahead with scheduling. I ask her to please call me back that afternoon with at least an update. I actually get a call back! Final repair is scheduled between 8:00 - 9:00 on the day I've taken off work for moving things.  I hear nothing that whole morning, and call the front office at 9:08 asking for an update. The woman who answers puts me on hold and checks in. "It looks like his first stop ran over, so he's running about an hour late."  So, look. I get that things happen, especially when you're building and repairing big items in someone's garage. But no one at the office could clue me in? I don't understand why, if I'm the one paying you for a service, I have to also be the one hounding people to call me back and get me some basic information. I don't like to be a griper and a nag. But I felt like I had to do it in order for someone from Neil's to communicate with me.   To be honest, the guy doing the work was AWESOME. He was very friendly and worked around some weird stuff he found in our cabinets. You can't even tell I mowed my car into the side of them last year. And it cost us $70 less than quoted. 5 stars for his handywork! 2 star for everything else. Maybe I am a one-off bad experience, seeing as everyone else is leaving flowing reviews. I wish I could.

Virtu has been on my radar since it opened, and I decided to finally bite the bullet and shell out some big (but not big as usual, thank you Restaurant Week!) bucks for dinner last weekend. It was. so. worth. it.  We had a 7:00 p.m. reservation on Saturday and arrived a few minutes early. We passed the time at the bar and I ordered a glass of wine. Bartender followed us out holding my drink to help us navigate to our patio seat. It's little above-and-beyond gestures like this that separate the rookies from the pros, people.  We lucked out with the mid-May weather this evening: GORGEOUS. The quaint background of Bespoke's courtyard and twinkle lights that created the most amazing early-summer atmosphere. As the sun went down, I decided wanted to move in and never leave.  Onto the important stuff: DINNER. Our server Stacey (I think that's her name!) was so friendly and helpful. Our restaurant week choices were:  -Simple salad for me: fresh arugula, sliced peaches, radish, crushed hazelnuts and a parmesan vinaigrette. Lots of textures intertwining here. A perfectly balanced and refreshing start to my meal.  -Sausage polpette for him: 3 sausage meatballs tossed in an AMAZING red sauce that seemed like it had been simmering all day, accompanied with a dollop of ricotta and grilled crostini. Fiance: "I just want to eat a gigantic bowl of this."   -Brown butter gnudi for me: Oh my sweet weeping infant mercy soul. Ricotta pillows sauteed in brown butter, tossed with English peas and mushrooms, some more of those crushed hazelnuts and topped with shaved pecorino. This. Was. Life. Affirming. I ate the entire bowl. I do not regret.  -Grilled pork rib chop for him: I was told this was the best pork in the history of mankind. It came with roasted carrots/asparagus and was served on top of a rosemary/goat cheese fondue. I KNOW!!! A gentleman sitting next to us spied the chop and immediately declared his order the same. A good game-time-decision, sir!  ...and onto DESSERT. We shared the strawberry olive oil cake (the most amazing, summery, juicy strawberries you have ever eaten, accompanied by pistachios and vanilla whipped cream draped over a perfect, not too sweet cake), and the chocolate peanut butter cup, which was basically out of control. A small, RICH portion of peanut butter mousse layered with chocolate mousse layered with crunchy chocolatey toffee. Two words: TO DIE.   So yes, Virtu is basically perfection. If I had a larger bank account, we would have much more frequent meals here. It is now my "special events" dinner default. There is no other choice.

Five stars is explained as "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" and there's basically no other way I can explain Pomo.  Pomo has been on our radar for a while; we were heartbroken when we tried to visit the downtown location and they were in that weird "closed for the afternoon" timeframe. (Don't feel bad for us, we ate at Cibo as a consolation.) I heard that they "reopened" their Scottsdale location in this space and we've been on a mission to get here ASAP!  Apparently everyone else has as well. We arrived around 4:30 on Friday for a "woohoo we both got off work early" celebraish and our only options were to sit outside (a little chilly for that, even by the beautiful fire/heaters. Yes, I'm a wimp.) or one of what I could see only two tables inside that didn't already have a "Reserved" sign.  Our server was Marie and she swooped right over, even though we came in the weird "in-between-meals-time" and the front of the house team was clearly having their line-up/pump-up schpeel. She told us about how the massive pizza oven (looked like it was covered in gilded pennies!) and it's owner were imported straight from Italy, recommended some of her favorites, and left us to peruse the menu.  We went with two of her recs: the Romano salad, Pomo's take on the classic Caesar. The dressing is veg-friendly and doesn't include anchovies, but is light and lemony and refreshing. Topped with perfectly crunch croutons and piles of freshly-shaved parm, this was definitely big enough for two to split as an appetizer. I also went with the Regina Margherita, a FRESH take on the classic. The fior di latte, the San Marzanos, the fresh basil...it was everything. My boyfriend went with the Pomo, which had Italian sausage, red bells, sauteed mushrooms and onions. Both pizzas were perfectly wood-fired, and the chili oil offered to drizzle over the top was DIE-vine!!! We were both stuffed after two pieces but both made ourselves eat a third!  Overall--a perfect addition to the hood. So glad it's close so we can visit again and again!

We love Mexican food. In a bad way. Why does a place with amazing food (espinaca queso, crispy potato tacos, steak tacos) less than 10 minutes away from our house with a beautiful (albeit overlooking Gold's Gym) patio get 2 stars?  No water. Requested multiple times from both server and food runner. Server clearly remembered I had asked for water about 10 minutes before and got really weird. Just apologize and bring water! Don't stay silent and awkward and avoid us!  I'm a habitual 20% tipper to a fault...not this time. This place lost me as a potential regular.

Welp, Yelp lied to me while I was on a mission to find juice. I searched for the new-to-Scottsdale Nekter, which curiously has 3 reviews, only to find the doors locked and signs of "opening soon" laughing in my place. Ugh! Internet, who knew you were full of lies!  Then I realized I was just a quick jaunt away from Juby True and decided to complete my trifecta of dbag (yoga-shopping-green juice) and off I went!  First, I love how cute this little stand is. It looks like a cozy, sunny beach house. In addition to juices, they have smoothies, coffee, tea and scrumptious looking baked goods. I grabbed a "pressed kale-aid" and loved it! It contains cucumber, kale, lemon, ginger, apple and celery. Ginger is a MUST for me in juices and this drink didn't disappoint with its spice-y kick. It was a delicious and incredibly refreshing addition to my day.  I have to take a star off for paying almost $10 for a bottle of juice. I know, I know, the location pretty much all but mandates high prices but come on! However, their one-day juice cleanse was listed as $50, which is lower than I've seen at other juice locations and for that, they shall stay on my radar!

We've been on a bit of a Fox binge lately, and I think I can sum up our feelings on The Henry in one word: Yup.  That's really all you need to know. It is outstanding.  First, the decor and ambiance is so glorious. You're sitting in someone's fancy mansion living room, except there's a gigantic kitchen in there so you can watch the action. It's such a unique environment, one that I haven't experienced in any other restaurant, and I LOVED IT.   I started with a delicious glass of Sangiovese blend, while boyfriend ordered a pinapple passion fruit from their homemade soda list. (LOVE this trend.) It was tart and refreshing!  We started with the kale and roasted garlic dip, because obviously this is what one does when they see such a thing of beauty on the menu. I'll now dream of that cheesy, bubbly dip and how to replicate it at home, but I'll know it's a lost cause and have to head back there to order it again and again. (Kale means it's low-cal.)  I decided to keep with the gluttonous theme for the night and go with the black truffle lasagna. Two more words: COME ON. Your own (deceptively) tiny skillet comes out of the oven in a glory of pasta, cheese, mushrooms and brussels. Those shaved brussels really made it. I had to pump myself up to finish the entire thing (because I am fat), but it was worth it. So, so worth it.  Boyfriend had been waffling between the roasted chicken and burger. Our server quickly assured him the burger was amazing, and he kept it classic with a side of fries. He said it was easily one of the best burgers of his life. (Remember that fat thing I said up there? I used some of his fries to finish off the lasagna sauce left in my plate. Told you.)  The Henry really did live up to the hype for us. The only downside was that I don't get to live next door. Many return visits await!

If I were to write a movie about my experience at Fired Pie, it would be a complete comedy of errors titled "Is Anyone Here Listening To Me?"  Fired Pie has been on my radar since it's close to where I live and I could basically live off pizza if I had to (and even if I didn't have to). The glowing Yelp reviews helped make our choice to go in for an early dinner on Friday.  The experience of making your own pizza and choosing your own toppings is awesome...if the people behind the counter are actually listening to you. Here is, verbatim, how it went when it was my turn:  Guy: "What can I get started for you?" Me: "I'll have the veggie pizza, but with pesto instead of red sauce" Guy: "Sure" *immediately picks up red sauce and puts all over my pizza* Me: "...can I have some pesto on there too?" Guy: "Yeah. What kind of cheese?" Me: "...um. Mozzerella." Guy: *Puts mozz on my pizza, slides it down to toppings area* Me: "Can I please have some pesto on there too?" Guy: "Oh, sure" *drizzles small spiral of pesto over cheese*  So. That's how that started.   The girl who handled my toppings seemed to have no idea what went on their menu-standard veggie. We both kept having to look back at the one menu on the side wall (they should definitely invest in an over-the-back-counter menu ala every other fast/casual food joint for ease) and check to make sure she got it correct. She wasn't sure what went on my boyfriend's pesto chicken pie either.   Speaking of boyfriend, he also handled to ordering for the field greens and roasted veggie salad we wanted. First guy lined up two salad bowls, so it looks like they split them there with no problem. Great! He also asked that they sub the balsamic out for italian dressing, which guy said would be no problem.  Once our pizzas rode the struggle bus out of the toppings area, we were asked for our names to write on the paper that our pizza slid onto in the oven, to keep everyone straight. We told them our order was for there, ordered drinks from the woman at the end of the line and sat down at a booth, after we picked up our own silverware and parm/red pepper shakers. Hopefully we could get over our ordering disaster and eat some delicious pizza!  I heard my name called and looked to the counter to see two pizza boxes and a boxed salad sitting on top (complete with a side of...you guessed it...balsamic dressing.) I couldn't do anything but laugh; it was the perfect ending to this nightmare of an order. First guy behind the counter had even taken out two bowls for our salad TO EAT THERE! Boyfriend was about to have a stress embolism so I scooped up our food and got the hell out of there. "We would literally have to order the opposite of what we wanted for it to come out right the first time," he said in the car. Basically.  Why the second star? I have to be fair, the food was absolutely delicious. The pizza's crust was really on point and the salad was completely filled with roasted veggie toppings (and even better once I added my own dressing from our fridge.) But it was downright insulting to have NO ONE working there listening to us. I don't understand at all. Was it an off night? Was it an off team working? Did they hate us for some reason? I doubt I can convince the boyfriend to go back, so maybe I'll never know. Dang.

One of the owners of Fired Pie reached out to me after reading my initial review. He apologized for our bad experience, said it was not up to their standards and offered to send me a gift card to try them out again. I accepted, and was really happy to see someone higher up caring about customers.  We called in an order last night, exactly the same as before. One veggie pie with pesto instead of red sauce, one pesto chicken pie and a roasted veggie salad with Italian instead of balsamic. My boyfriend had the call on speaker and I heard the girl repeat our order back to him just as we wanted it. Great!  Apparently all did not go as smooth as it sounded when he went to go pick up our food. First, the girl at the register didn't know how to run the gift card. Then, when our order was 10 cents over the gift card's $25 amount, she gave my boyfriend back the wrong change. (He only had a $20 on him and she initially gave him back $19.10 instead of $19.90)   THEN we get home and all looks well...except my pie has red sauce on it. Fired Pie, do you have a personal vendetta against me eating pesto or what?! I started cracking up, and boyfriend vowed that he'll never go there again. It SUCKS, because the food is so great! We received the correct dressing this time for the salad, which was delish! It just goes to show how little service details can really make or break a place for us. Luckily for Fired Pie, it looks like basically everyone else going there has four or five star experiences...I guess we're just outta luck.

I love checking out new dining ideas and I definitely welcomed the casual/healthy approach to everything I read about Foosia.  We came early on a Friday evening (about 5:45) and were one of only 2 occupied tables at the time. The crowd grew as we ate; people in line were pretty interested in learning about this new concept.  I assembled my meal with brown rice, tofu, the wok-glazed veggie mix (you can also sub just regular steamed vegetables), their peanut sauce, toasted peanuts, herb mix, bean sprouts and two lime wedges for squeezing.  The good:  -Tasty ingredients. The brown rice was fluffy perfection. We both agreed we were wary that it might be stale/chewy based on appearance, but it was ideal in taste and texture. All vegetables and toppings were super fresh!  -My fried-to-order tofu cubes were abundant in amount and seasoned perfectly.  -The sauces were absolutely delicious. I tried a sample of their peanut sauce and knew it would make it's way to my bowl. Their website says it contains peanuts, dark soy sauce and coconut milk. Boyfriend used the BBQ sauce on his bowl and it was incredibly flavorful as well.   -Ample toppings of extras. The herb mix gave the PERFECT minty/basily pop throughout the bowl. The lime wedges gave the perfect amount of final bright flavor. Protip: Don't try to add TOO many selections, as tempting as they look.  The "needs work" section:  -I can see this ordering system getting really slow during peak times. I like that I got my tofu made right as I ordered, but it took a few minutes and I wonder if a busy lunch line would get backed up?  -It would be great if the menu gave descriptions of what's all in the sauces. Their peanut sauce is labeled "Two nuts walk into a bar..." which is cute and obviously their peanut sauce, but listing out the ingredients as it's shown on their website could probably save both staff and customer some time.  -Girl forgot to top boyfriend's bowl with his sauce. Not a huge deal, but I did have to go up and get a ramekin for pouring. We'd be out of luck had we taken our order to go.  All in all, I liked Foosia. We will definitely be back, but will probably give them a few weeks in between trips in order for them to work some kinks out. A great addition to the area!

Yelp, you did not let me down. After perusing Dose Moving's mountain of 5 stars, I decided to contact them for our recent move.  We didn't have a TON of stuff to move, seeing as how we had new furniture delivered to our new place, but we DID have lots of kitchen stuff, a queen sized bed/mattress, a dresser and some other various boxes to take care of. After deciding our sanity was worth paying for, rather than renting a U-Haul and torturing ourselves, Dose was my first choice. And they were AWESOME. I was even able to call the night before our movers were scheduled, and add on some extra packing supplies. (I was OVER IT by then.)  Three guys showed up a little early the morning of our appointment, and set to work. And even though they were a little early, they didn't start charging me until my set appointment time. Because they are the best. Everything was taken apart, loaded up, hauled over and put perfectly in our new place in like...not even an hour. Worth every single dollar I spent. (And I spent WAY less dollars than I thought I would!) Dose, I hate moving, but I am absolutely using you for any other moves in the future!

I've established a tradition in the past few weeks called "Pizza Friday." Pizza Friday is where I've worked out all week, stayed mindful of my nutrition and decide that Friday evening calls for a celebration. Of pizza!   We've been watching this space for a while, checking in the windows when visiting Pita Jungle and hoping it would be good, as it's pretty close to home. Verdict: We have a winner!  We arrived a little early on a (Pizza) Friday evening, and JUST beat a rush. Not sure what the deal was, but the place became PAAAACKED with families with small children. Our server cracked a joke about Chuck E. Cheese, so apparently it's not the norm (yet?), but just know that if tons of strollers/kiddos surround you, the place can get loud. Even so, nothing could ruin the delicious meal we had!  We started splitting the Chopped Salad, which the kitchen portioned onto two separate plates for us without our asking. The salad of mixed greens, corn, tomatoes, cukes, red onion, ricotta salata and a refreshing basil vin was a great summery starter. All ingredients were uniformly chopped and it was lightly dressed to perfection. Add a slice of crusty bread and I could eat a whole portion of this for an ideal solo meal.  But who wants just salad with there's pizza involved!? We chose a classic Margherita and a Patate (roasted fingerlings, gorgonzola, mozz, onions, pancetta on half) to split. The Margherita was dreamy, with perfectly browned fior di latte and a delicious red sauce. The Patate was next-level. Those onions? They were amazingly caramelized and sweet and provided an excellent contrast to the sharp gorgonzola (my love) and roasty potatoes. Boyfriend said the pancetta was a great smoky/crispy addition. The crust on both was a classic combo of charred/chewy/chrispy that we love about wood-fired pies.  We were stuffed. Server described their gelatos, which included a sea salt caramel choice. We immediately surrendered and ordered that as an affogato. A huge scoop was drowned in delicious espresso, and I pretty much don't know what life was before I ate it. It was AMAZING.  So, all in all? We want to try every single menu item. Our food was glorious, but we couldn't stop looking at all the other table's choices as well. Il Capo, I'll see you again and again for more Pizza Fridays!

Plus-a-star-to-five-stars update!  Il Capo is just seriously dreamy. The service is great. The food is phenomenal. I'm officially a fangirl for life.  We visited this past Saturday for an early (5:00 I think?) dinner. I had passed out for 2 hours after a HOT and HILLY half marathon (never again) and woke up ravenous. I wanted something to re-fill that calorie deficit. I wanted IL CAPO!  It was hard to decide on something other than pizza, since our first visit's pizza choices were so outstanding. But we explored the rest of the menu (we are so brave) and landed on: happy hour bruschetta (3 pieces for $2.95...delish!), eggplant parm for me, chicken parm for boyfriend. There was not even a crumb or swipe of sauce left on any plates. WIN.  Both our mains were outstanding but we both RAVED and fell in deep, real love with the side of pasta and marinara our dinners came with. Perfectly al dente pasta with homemade sauce topped with parsley and Parmesan...I know it sounds so simple but when it's done so perfectly words escape you, you know? Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. My wine was great. I slept like a bambino that night.  Il Capo, I've said it before, but thanks for being alive!

This place is state of the art and fantastic! This coming from a girl who definitely doesn't golf and has only attempted the driving range once in her life. (That resulted in me being really sore for like 3 days.) My boyfriend works in the golf biz and we'd been watching the construction on this place like hawks for months. So glad it's finally open and so close to where we live!  We went during their soft opening last night. I know the first few days of a business being open can come with dealing with kinks, but all staff/service/amenities were completely up to par (GOLF PUNS!) and beyond. We were never left wanting for anything. Our gal came around plenty of times for food orders, drinks, refills and was awesome. She was also really knowledgeable about what they didn't quite have available on the menu, since they aren't 100% fully open to the public yet. A great touch. (Also? The bathrooms were PRISTINE.)  The food was pleasantly and surprisingly great. I had the nachos, which consisted of individual tortilla chips covered in "drunken beans" and topped with multiple cheeses (yes, queso dip is involved) and green and red jalapenos with servings of guac and pico for dipping. It was completely delicious. Boyfriend ordered the "mushi" (think mexican pin-wheel/sushi remix) that he said was outstanding and way more filling than it looked. I had two glasses of delicious and surprisingly strong strawberry/mint sangria that set us back $5 apiece. WHAT?  So, onto the actual reason of Topgolf: Golf games! Like I said, I don't participate but boyfriend and guys we were with loved it. It seemed glorious. You can either bring your clubs or used the standard ones they provide (for both men and ladies!) and choose between different games, i.e., hitting 5 balls in a row into each massive lit-up target on the range, hitting 1 ball into each target, distance competitions, etc. Each bay is fitted with a TV that follows your score and tracks your balls.  An aside: The view is freaking ridiculous. Camelback behind you, Talking Stick in front of you (which is all lit up in dancing neon lights now--I'm guessing they realized they have to make it look sweet with all the people staring right at the place while they hit balls.) All in all, this is such a fun place, and different than anything else available in the area for an afternoon/night out. Will it become super crowded/overrun with drunks during spring training? Absolutely! Will we totally enjoy ourselves during all other times of the year? Yes!

First things first: Make a reservation. I decided to play it safe and reserve a table for 6:00 p.m. on Saturday evening. At first I thought I was probably over-cautious with a reservation so early, but the dining room was packed! I think the only available seating was around the bar, which was humming.  As everyone else says, the space is open, colorful, breezy and beautiful. I loved every little detail--the vases, lights, knick-knacks, intricate metal candle holders, all with a heavy dose of bright magenta pink and orange. It was trendy and welcoming and just right. The open garage door walls made for perfect summer dinner ambiance.  Our server was sweet and explained the menu thoroughly, and gave us some recommendations. Our haul:  -Sake sangria for me: sake, cucumber vodka, ginger, other assortment of flavors to make for an absolutely refreshing cocktail  -Traditional guacamole (I'm eyeballing the pomegranate/dried fruit gauc for next time) and house-fried chips. This was magnificent. The queso fresco and citrus notes of the chunky guac made it some of the best I've ever had in a restaurant. To be honest, I think it's a little silly that you only receive 5 chips in total (and they are amazing--crispy and perfectly seasoned) and another order of chips is $1. But I don't want that to take away from how delicious this dish was.  -Mushroom tacos: Perfect little street tacos with AMAZING smoky-grilled mushrooms. These were perfection. I could eat about 10 of these, if left to my own devices. I put a little leftover guacamole on mine---tastebud party.  -Shishito peppers: Shishitos have become a personal obsession of mine over the past year and if they are on the menu, you can bet I will order them. The ample portion came tossed in a delicious soy caramel glaze. Word to the wise, these are marked as Vegetarian on their menu, but are topped with bonito flake (dried fish flakes). Seeing as I'm becoming increasingly "meh" in my vegetarianism, I just ate the ones on the bottom. I wasn't passing up these beauts!  Finally, I chose the sumo green roll to round out the meal. A perfect portion of a veggie roll, topped with a tasty tomatillo salsa. Boyfriend had the lamb chop, which I thought was a teensy bit tiny for $12, but he said it was absolutely delicious.   We thought we couldn't handle any other food, but then our gal ran through the dessert list. HOLY. We ended up on their take of a tres leches cake, topped with toasted whipped cream, drenched in what seemed like melted ice cream (I'm sure there is a more fancy word for this) with a side of chocolate crispies (again, I'm sure something fancier than what I'm describing). It was honestly? Life changing. The other desserts sounded just as amazing. Mexican chocolate lava cake with a horchata drizzle? Trio of paletas?!  All in all, what a perfect addition to the neighborhood. If I'm feeling like a special occasion dinner, I'm probably choosing Sumo Maya!

Oh man. Not all aspects of planning a wedding are fun and exciting, but from the moment we walked into A Bakeshop for our tasting, I knew we were in for a treat! (Or many bite-sized treats!)  We went with a three-tier cake with various flavors for our wedding. I wanted to have a variety for our guests, so we went with strawberry, chocolate peanut butter, and what seems to be their house-specialty: CASSATA. We'd never heard of this flavor, but when we read the description (Italian cream, chocolate chips, cinnamon, OMG I'm dying about it right now), we decided we HAD to have it on our cake. It wasn't one of the tasting flavors Andrea had pulled out, but she grabbed the last piece they had on display just for us. It was insanely delicious. SOLD!  I had our florist drop off some sprigs of baby's breath to decorate our cake when it was delivered, and it turned out so gorgeous! It ended up being so much more beautiful than my inspiration picture I had send Andrea.  If I'm being honest, I spent more money on wedding cake than I ever DREAMED I would. BUT, the quality, customer service, and tastiness made me know I made the right decision to work them into our budget! We don't live close to A Bakeshop, but whenever we are in the area we will absolutely stop in for a sweet!

We had an 8:00 reservation this past Friday for our first dinner at The Upton. I always forget what a shitshow parking in Old Town can be (It's like I've blacked out the memories of living near there like a PTSD victim) so word to the wise: take advantage of their valet.  First impression: This place is tiny and CUTE! As a few other reviews have mentioned, the majority of seating options are outdoors. I hope this doesn't deter business in the blazing hot months that are just weeks away (sob), but with ample tree coverage, tons of umbrellas and hopefully a strong mister system, I think evenings out on this back patio will still be pleasant in the summer.  We started off splitting the farro salad, which was a tasty mixture of perfectly-cooked farro, roasted cauliflower, diced tomatoes and arugula/herbs all tossed together. It comes with a charred lemon half for squeezing over the whole thing, which is a refreshing touch. The menu doesn't mention cauliflower and tomatoes at all, so just an FYI. (Fiance doesn't LOVE cauliflower, so it would have been nice to know about.)  For mains we chose the vegan ramen with tofu (for me, obviously) and the Little Havana sandwich. The ramen bowl was outstanding! Deliciously spiced tofu, a variety of mushrooms and a ton of other veggie mix-ins all made for a tasty (and huge; I tried my hardest but I think there was still half left) bowl. The "Little" Havana was a not-so-little take on the Cuban that got rave reviews. We decided to split a side of fries...because who cares?! They were hand-cut and I couldn't stop dipping into the bowl long after I was full. Clearly, portions are great here.   (That's code for: Maybe don't be so fat like us and order like it's your last meal on earth.)  All in all, a tasty-face visit!

So my fiance doesn't drink and I very rarely drink beer (card-carrying member of the wino club here), so while we've thrown around the idea of heading to SBC for dinner for a while now, we just never got around to it.  Well, 2016 has started off as a special sort of dumpster fire and on Saturday we found ourselves NEEDING to get out of the house after being cooped up in there with about 20 fans blowing on our carpet/baseboards to counteract our water heater flooding all over the place. That's neither here nor there (and I'm sure I'll write some strongly worded Yelps regarding a few contractors...) and we found ourselves STARVING this past Saturday evening. It's just down the street, so why not? We headed down and snagged a table on the twinkle-light-adorned patio and perused the menu.  One thing I'm apt to order about 99% of the time if it's on any menu is any sort of soft pretzels/cheese/mustard situation. We decided on those as an app and they arrived to our table HOT. Awesome! The beer cheese had a very tasty and nuanced beer undertone, and the mustard was grainy and perfectly spicy.   I decided to keep my meal in the theme of health and went for a "small" (generous for most non-giants) portion of mac and cheese and a side salad. The mac was a cheesy mess topped with toasty Panko. It was comfort food times a million. My side salad came with, honestly? One of the best Italian dressings I've ever had. I'm stupidly picky about salad dressing and don't love most, but this was herby and dreamy. Fiance went with their special of BBQ chicken drumsticks, potato salad (the mustardy kind), baked beans and a buttermilk roll. He wasn't expecting to find some of the best BBQ chicken he'd ever had at Scottsdale Beer Company, but he did and the few bites I snagged were life-affirming. And the buttermilk roll? Get out of here. This is unfortunately a special and not on their regular menu, but if you see this dish on their specials list...GET IT.   I did decide to peruse their drink menu and got some sort of seasonal pomegranate cider. This was the perfect balance of tart (not too sweet at all!) and refreshing. All in all, SBC has shot itself up to one of our favorite spots in just one trip. Bravo!

Sometimes I think there is no middle ground in Old Town between hole-in-the-wall-dive and rave-til-you-puke. Happily, I think The Montauk has achieved this balanced nirvana! Bungalow was fun and fine for game day, but The Montauk is such an upgrade!   I've been here twice now--once for just drinks out on their back patio, and once for dinner on the front patio this past weekend. Our evening here was the perfect kickoff for my bachelorette party weekend!  It's the perfect mix of casual, breezy and fun. (The beach-house aesthetic is on point.) After waiting a few minutes for an outdoor table and grabbing some drinks, we perused the menu. I went with the chicken kabobs, which come with a kale salad and fries. The best of both worlds!! Last year I started eating meat after almost 11 years of vegetarianism, and seafood is one of the foods I still generally side-eye. I tried a bite of my friend's fish taco and it was DELICIOUS! I can see why people rave.   Our server was friendly and cute and after dinner my friends and I had an impromptu dance party in the bathroom. Success!

Yes to everything!  I had a good feeling our inaugural visit to Twisted Grove would be stellar, seeing as how Grassroots is one of our favorite haunts. We were not disappointed!   We stopped in pretty early on Friday (5:45ish) and snagged one of the very last open tables available without a reservation. We weren't sat on the patio, but right next to one of the open doors so I got to pretend we were out there. Happy hour is available until 6:00 p.m., so we last-minute-snagged specialty priced bruschetta and I took advantage of their awesome HH wine special: ANY wine by the glass for $7! I had a glass of Predator "Old Vine" Zinfandel, which was a perfect accompaniment to my food.  Our bruschettas were the avocado/pickled onion/cilantro/jalapeno (2, since it sounded so good to both of us), and one of the goat cheese/dates/candied walnuts/honey. Both were outstanding. The bread was perfect and the toppings were fresh and worked so well together. The avocado's bread was SLATHERED in butter...or maybe it was very soft cheese? Or something. It was something that tasted delicious and unhealthy and I definitely did not care what the calorie count was.  For mains, I went with the mushroom & boursin cheese flatbread while my fiance had the tri tip sandwich with parmesan-garlic frittes. Word on the frittes: GET THEM. PARMESAN. GARLIC. YES. I devoured my flatbread. There was a moment with a few pieces left where I knew I could quit eating and be fine, but the garlicky spread of cheese and sauteed mushrooms topped arugula made me know feeling stuffed would be worth it. Tri tip was amazing/tender and like I said...those fries.  I lied, I did feel a twinge of remorse for cashing my whole flatbread, when I realized I was so full I wouldn't be able to sample the MONKEYBREAD for dessert. Pictures of that dish put Twisted Grove on our radar in the first place. But don't you worry, because now it is permanently on our "regular" rotation. Instant classic!

We have been legit STALKING this space ever since the banners went up that a Flower Child was taking over the old crappy Applebee's location. I spent months salivating over the fact that Flower Child would be within WALKING DISTANCE FROM HOME. All that build-up would have to lead to some sort of disappointment, right?  WRONG.  It's perfect--if you can go at a time where there isn't a balls-long line out the door.  Our first visit was a Friday for early dinner. We arrived around 5:30 p.m. (I'd been sick all week so I just wanted to eat early and sleep early--lay off my grandparent dinner-time, OK?!) Even at the early hour, there were several tables filled in the dining room, and the patio was about half-full as well. A good, good sign.  The inside is so cute. You're sitting in someone's open, breezy, sunny, clean room and waiting for food perfection. The decor is clean and cute.  I decided on the Thai Dye wrap: tofu, Thai basil (my FAVORITE), avo, carrot, radish, cilantro, snap peas. Their homemade wheat/flax/chia wraps are the absolute best. Fiance went with the Flying Avocado wrap: chicken, smoked Gouda, romaine, tomato, avocado hummus(!). We were both enamored with our fresh our wraps were and how tasty everything was. We also decided to split the Thai cashew quinoa bowl. This was absolutely outstanding. Perfectly cooked and amazingly seasoned red quinoa tossed with a variety of "Asian-y" vegetables (Shiitakes and snap peas stood out), mixed with cashews for the perfect crunch. Add a protein onto this and you're golden for a meal.  Oh, and the flavored iced teas/lemonade/not a soda to be found? Refreshment-face.  Sounds good, right? Well, good enough to RETURN FOR TAKE-OUT LUNCH THE NEXT DAY! Hey, when we find something we love, we love it. At 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon there was a line to the door, so we called in our order while we ran some errands to take up the 35 minute wait time. We returned 25 minutes later to find our food packaged up and ready to go.  2nd round: Chopped vegetable salad with added tofu for me. Probably my new favorite salad. Everything is so dang FRESH, and the miso vinaigrette packed such a lovely punch. Hippie Chick wrap for him. Apparently FC's version of the chicken salad is the best he's ever had. We tried a side of sesame soba noodles for kicks. So tasty, and perfectly portioned!  Do you think we're obsessed enough? Well, we're planning on picking up dinner after I get out of a late meeting tomorrow. So yes, we are three-trips-in-one-week happy that Flower Child has arrived!

This place!!  I very randomly found Freshbox while running some errands over my Friday lunch break. I HATE the vortex of doom that is driving around the FLLW/Hayden area, but that's where I was when I ventured onto Yelp with a hope and a prayer that I could find lunch close, but not there.  Enter: Freshbox. I quick jaunt down Bell and I was in bizness. I opted for a Primal Warrior salad, add shredded chicken. The salad had some of my absolute favorite ingredients: kale, spinach, roasted beets, tomato, avocado (a whole half!), sunflower seeds. (I left the roasted brussels off, but it usually comes with those, too). My salad bowl was on a food scale the whole time the gal was adding each ingredient, which I actually appreciate. It means portions are consistent and their calorie counts are closer to what they display on the menu. The chicken was perfect and when I tossed it with a little of their cilantro dressing, it was outstanding!   The prices on their online menu are higher than what I paid, so I'm not sure if prices have gone down or if chicken is that much cheaper than steak, but I paid less than $10 for an awesome, fresh, filling salad. So happy to have stumbled upon Freshbox!

We've been into Maverick a few times, and I definitely dig it.  I'd never think a cute/comfortable coffee shop where I'd actually want to hang out a while would be in this plaza, but Maverick proved me wrong! We're usually grab and go coffee drinkers, but both visits we've hung out and relaxed while we finished our drinks. There are a few high-top tables, a long, larger table for bigger groups in the middle of the room, a few nooks of comfy couches and chairs for a couple, and a semi-private room in the back. Really, you can come here with almost any amount of people and find a place to hang! The decor is neat, and whatever the contraption hanging from the ceiling making drip coffee (I'm sure I'm screwing up this terminology terribly) is, it's awesome!  Both visits we nabbed iced coffees, and once we shared a pastry as well. All delish! I do think it's a tad on the pricey side to swoop in for a coffee, but I know that comes with the territory for an independent shop. Employees we've encountered have ranged from incredibly friendly to "meh," which, again, comes with the territory.  All in all, it's a fine place for a caffeine fix!

A few weeks ago I Googled "Lululemon Outlets" on a whim to see where the few chosen locations in the country were. I figured my best bet to catch one would be on a future road trip out to California or something. Imagine my immediate HEART ATTACK when I saw Lululemon Westgate "opening soon"...WHAT!  You better believe I hauled my cookies way out yonder to check out the location. There's not many things that prompt me to drive 40 minutes to Glendale, but yes, the Lulu outlet is definitely one of them.  I love that it's organized by size. Makes hunting down your styles super easy. I've read a few people on their Facebook complaining about the selection of shorts, but I thought they easily made up for it in the pants section, at least in the 6 and 8 sections I fall into. Employees were super friendly as usual. If anything, I'd say the store went a little overboard in stocking outerwear, but I'm sure they can't pick and choose what they receive from HQ's "We Made Too Much." Not necessarily a huge need in the Valley, but I can see how this would be an insane find for people visiting from colder climates.  I walked out with a pair of full-length Wunder Unders and two tanks for about $60 less than I've paid for at a regular Lulu. Absolutely worth the trek! Yay!

Usually when I rate a place 4 stars I'm definitely going to become a return customer. However, I seriously will never make it back to Snooze again any time soon. Not that it wasn't great--it was! But it was a Thursday morning at 8:00 a.m. We both happened to have the day off work to run some wedding-related errands and this during-the-week-early-morning time is the ONLY time I've cruised by Snooze without an hour-plus wait.   And I mean, I get it. It's amazing and delicious and has a great following from Colorado, yadda yadda. But there are seriously no places worth waiting that long on the weekends when there are millions of other breakfast patios to grace in Scottsdale.   That being said, our first trip was glorious! We snagged a table out on the patio and our friendly server was prompt with iced coffee and menu recommendations. I went with the breakfast burrito, sans cheese, add chicken sausage and green chili sauce. THAT SAUCE! Some of the best verde ever, and TONS of it...but without making the burrito soaked? Not sure how, but so delicious. Fiance went with a BYO omlette, with some of what he said was the tastiest bacon of life. Corn tortillas on the side instead of toast. (LOVE this option.)   Of course, we'd have been remiss to not sample at least one pancake option at Snooze. Our server recommended the cinnamon roll pancake, and it did NOT disappoint. The cinnamon butter served atop. OMG. The candied pecans, the icing glaze, the vanilla chips...everything.  The portions are huge here, and try as we might, we definitely couldn't finish any one plate. We will definitely try to be back...but it will have to be for a random weekday experience.

What gets five stars at Southern Rail? Absolutely everything. If anything, I'd fault them for being such a drive from my house. If we lived closer, we'd be here WEEKLY.  I made a Saturday reservation on a whim last week, and it was basically the best decision I've made all year. The space is Southern-classic-sleek (we found it reminiscent of The Henry) and very inviting. Service (we had Seth watching over us) was perfection. Wine and herbal iced tea was delicious. Food was transcendent.  The cornbread muffins with black pepper/honey butter (!!!) were perfect little bites. The kale and barley salad came with collard green pesto, roasted grapes (IMMEDIATE FAVORITE THAT I MUST RE-CREATE), orange segments and toasted candied pecans. So delicious; the texture contrasts were awesome. The edamame/corn/tomato/green bean/pepper/pea succotash was basically everything I need in my life. I believe I detected a sautee in white wine as the mysterious flavor undertone that made it SO. VERY. GOOD. Fiance had to go with the fried chicken and yes, this $20 fried chicken is worth it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied the four gigantic pieces were what dreams are made of.  If anything, my only regret is that we were too stuffed for dessert. I spied a brioche bread pudding (with *bourbon*sauce*!?) that we will absolutely get on our next visit. And there will be PLENTY of next visits!   Cheers, Southern Rail!

SO HAPPY this place underwent a reno and has new owners. We live right across the street but didn't come here as much as you would think, due to really spotty service and just a general "grimey" feeling. The food was always great, but everything else was so blah. We came in for breakfast this past Saturday and this place has improved, immensely!  Gone is the general frantic feeling at the host desk, the hit-or-miss service and the gigantic menu. In their place is a well-oiled breakfast machine with a streamlined menu (keeping the favorites and adding a few dishes/fresh juices/etc.) and great staff.   The new owner stopped by our table and others throughout the dining room and made sure everything was great. And it was! It seems like this place is going through the First Watch-ish transition that a few Good Eggs have gone through, and it is a major upgrade!
