We went to Little Saigon a few months ago, with the expectation that this is gonna be one of the few places with great Vietnamese food we can fall back on when we crave it due to all the great reviews on Yelp. However, just like another one in Cave Creek, it blew away my expectations, and not in a good way. I dunno what it is, but maybe since I'm Asian and I go to Vietnamese restaurants you can give us crap food and crap service? Hell, I don't even care about the service, all I really care about is the food.  Service - ok. barely. nobody bothered to refill our drinks, even though we were right outside the kitchen, with NOBODY else there dining at the time. The girl took forever to come take our order, messed up our order, and had trouble with the credit card machine afterwards as well. Damn. If you were new (don't know for sure) at least let us know what to expect.  Food: We ordered spring rolls, chicken pho, cold noodles, and the infamous #55 spare ribs that many people raved about via quick tips at the time.  Spring rolls: Ok, but the peanut sauce tasted like...well...let's just say water would've had more flavor. How can you mess up peanut sauce?  Pho: not bad, but nothing great to write home about.  Cold noodles: see above   infamous #55 spare ribs: Well, I don't really know. When we got this thing in a clay pot, we opened it, and there were pieces of fish. We were like WTF? We asked the waitress, to which she replied, yes, that's #55. We asked if #55 was fish, and not spare ribs, to which the waitress replied yes. She then goes back into the kitchen, and moments later, the cook comes out, asks us if we wanted spare ribs, which we confirmed. He then said he would cook us the spare ribs, and took away the clay pot full of fish. It wouldn't have been so bad if the spare ribs were amazing, but what came back was a few lumps of meat on bone that was submerged in black pepper. Of course, there were no apologies. If you go to their website and look at their menu, #55 is clearly NOT fish.  After we finished what barely passed as dinner, we got our bill, and gave our dedit card to the waitress. She seemed to have a lot of trouble with the credit card machine, and apparently entered in the wrong amount the first time, so she had to do a refund and start a new transaction. Normally, not a big deal. However, she was fumbling around, not saying anything, then going in and out the kitchen with our debit card, then finally someone showed her what to do. In the meantime, we were starting to wonder if they had taken down our debit card number, and if our checking account was going to be wiped out by the time we got home (did not, thank god).   Needless to say, we won't be back...

Once again, we find ourselves duped by the high reviews on Yelp on yet another Asian restaurant. We were on our way to Yu's Chinese Express but made a detour since a friend had mentioned this place, not to mention it had four stars on Yelp.  We go in, get seated, and after reading through the menu we are excited. Lots of traditional Chinese dishes, some of which we haven't had in a long time, so our hopes were high.  First thing we ordered was the hot and sour soup. A steal at $3.50 for a small portion, which was enough to feed 3-4. Unfortunately, it was neither hot (spicy) nor sour. It wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't live up to its name.  Besides the soup, we ordered the House Special Lo Mein, Sizzling Hot Plate Beef, Szechuan Green Beans, and Yui Shan Eggplant. We were expecting a feast, but was severely disappointed.  The Sizzling Hot Plate Beef arrived first. Interestingly enough, the beef was on a regular plate (not sizzling), which the waitress then dumped on to a hot plate (sizzled maybe just a bit). Then, she put a spoonful of what looked like rice wine over the dish, then attempted to set it on fire. That was a big FAIL, and then she tried to do it again, without success. We basically ended up with a non sizzling plate of beef that was drenched with rice wine. The Szechuan Green Beans were next, but it had a sweet taste to it. This was definitely another first...normally they are supposed to be salty and a bit spicy. The Yui Shan Eggplant was alright, which was probably the best part of the meal just above the white rice.  The kicker of course, was the House Special Lo Mein. When we ordered it the waitress made sure that we wanted crunchy noodles (cake noodle, or so we thought) and not soft noodles. We said yes, we want crunchy noodles. What we got was a plate of vegetables and meat with a side of fried won ton strips. Seriously? Normally I would've taken a few pictures, but I think I was in so much shock it didn't register in my head.   While the service wasn't bad (drinks refilled consistently) the food was blasphemous. Never again.

We haven't been back in a while due to their friendly but not so good service. They offer free refills on sodas and teas but usually don't bother to refill them during the meal, maybe only when they come to clean up, which they do as soon as they sense that you're about finished.  I do have to say they've got one of the best egg rolls I've tasted anywhere, and their spring rolls were pretty good too. Plus they have actually have good tasting peanut sauce for the spring rolls.  I always order either chicken or beef pho, while the g/f usually gets the vermicelli noodle bowls. I'd have to say their pho/broth is probably the best tasting and flavorful in the west valley for me. I ordered their Bun Bo Hue once though, and that was super oily so order at your own risk.  After sampling a few other places, it looks like we'll be back to Pholicious before long.

We have stopped coming to Pholicious since the last time we came in I received super oily chicken pho (I uploaded a pic). It was difficult to eat,  and whereas I usually drink a good portion of the broth after I finish the noodles, I couldn't stand it this time. It seems like there's different staff every time we come in as well. The rolls and other items we order are still really good, but you can't call yourself Pholicious if your pho sucks. What a shame.

Wow. After seeing all the great reviews on Yelp we decided to try out Viet Kitchen, since it's right next to the Costco we go to all the time. We've had our share of Vietnamese food, so there were high hopes going in. Obviously, it didn't turn out so great. It all started when the lady took two separate parties' orders first even though they came after us...  We ordered fresh spring rolls, which usually comes with an awesome peanut sauce to dip in. However, when the rolls came, the wrapper was so thin it ripped, it was mostly lettuce and hardly any pork/shrimp inside, and the worst part was the peanut sauce tasted like nothing. Not a hint of peanut. Had to add some hoisin sauce to give it taste.   I ordered the spicy beef noodle soup (similar to bun bo hue), and the lady asked to make sure I wanted it hot and spicy. I answered with an enthusiastic yes, and the g/f ordered the pork combo sandwich. The food took a while, and the sandwich actually came much after the noodle soup. How long does it take to make a sandwich? What's even worse, there was hardly anything stuffed between each bun (see picture posted). I wish I took a picture of my "spicy" soup...normally with a spicy soup the soup is red, but mine was clear with a dab of redness here and there. I had to supplement it with a LOT of sriracha sauce...definitely not impressed.   On top of it all, the servers (different from the one that took the order) who brought the food were not friendly at all. They didn't say a word when putting our food on the table, and when we thanked them they didn't reply. This is definitely not a place we will be going back to; if there's ever a pho or noodle soup craving I'd rather drive down to Central Phoenix to Maxim Restaurant.

I grew up in Hawaii (lived there for 20 years) and after moving to the mainland a few years ago, the only good Hawaiian/Korean style BBQ I've had was in Vegas, which the kama'aina refer to as the 9th island due to the many people from Hawaii who've moved there.   Since moving to AZ a year ago, we've only had our cravings satisfied when we go to Vegas, that is, until we found out about Leo's. Granted, it's not 100% authentic, but then again, there's nothing like it out here, especially in the west valley.   The bbq chicken is super tender and tasty, mac salad is superb, and the katsu curry is ono-licious! Musubi's are pretty good, though there's too much rice. The broccoli and the occasional romaine lettuce used to soak up the oils is a bit odd, but it doesn't detract from the flavors at all...most of the time the usual cabbage is still used.   Our first visit there they were playing some uh..."interesting" music, but subsequent visits have yielded better results, and it finally has more of a local flavor. Add that to the friendly employees/owner and their awesome food, and they've got a regular customer in me. Until of course, when they add spicy chicken or pork to their menu, which means I'm gonna have to go more often!

Actually, I wish I could give this place 3 1/2 stars, since it's certainly not a 3 star, but it definitely isn't 4, at least not yet. It supposedly is under new management (according to a quick tip a week ago) but we didn't see any signs of that. We have not been here prior to new ownership/management, so I can't say if things have changed.   Service - Excellent. Lady was very attentive, kept my drink filled constantly, even after the bill was paid (big kudos).   Food - Well, this is where it was somewhat lacking. Reading the other reviews I thought this place would have pretty authentic stuff, but I was wrong. Maybe it was prior to new management/ownership, but certainly not now. We ordered:  Won ton soup with noodles: while the noodle soup wasn't too shabby (a bit bland for me), the won tons were disappointing. The skin was too thick, and it really ended up tasting more like dumplings than won tons.   Lemon chicken: pretty good stuff. Chicken was moist and thinly battered, and not too oily from the deep frying. Lots of lemon sauce, would definitely order again.  Ma-po tofu: extremely disappointing, didn't taste like your traditional ma-po tofu at all. It was bland, without any meat in it, and with huge chunks of tofu. Basically looked (and tasted) like hot and sour soup on a plate, but with less soup and spice.  Singapore rice noodles: Surprisingly good. Had a slightly spicy curry taste to it, would definitely order again.  Location is a bit off, but not hard to find. Nice ambiance inside. Not too busy when we went (Sat night...but it was starting to storm) but lots of take outs. Will probably be back to try other items.

This place certainly surprised me. While their selection isn't as vast as other buffets, it felt like the quality of cooked food was better and not as oily. They even had one of my favorite dishes, the "fish fragrant eggplant" (direct translation)! I've tried a lot of different chinese restaurants and buffets, and this is probably the best I've had in AZ. Another thing that surprised me was how fresh and sweet the fruits were...it certainly tastes a lot better than the fruits I normally get at Costco!  We went around 7 pm and the place probably had no more than 20 customers. Service was good, drinks were filled consistently, and the staff even apologized that some food wasn't as fresh due to lack of customers. When they ran out of the eggplant dish we requested some more, and within ten minutes a fresh batch was put out!   I think it'll be just a matter of time before more people discover this place. I have already become a regular!  minus one star for not having green tea ice cream :p

It doesn't get any easier or better working with such a great team. I emailed to set up an appointment to get a quote on rewiring our office. Mike the owner responded within a few hours, arrived on time for our appointment, was very pleasant, and gave me a very competitive estimate for the job, even before the military discount.   After we scheduled the work, we met up with Mike #2 (master electrician) and his crew of 1 (can't remember his name) but both were a pleasure to work with. Master Mike (as we call him to differentiate between Owner Mike) knew exactly how we wanted things done almost even before we told him, and really blew our expectations away. Not only did our project get done within the estimated price they finished ahead of schedule. It doesn't get better than this. Too bad Owner Mike only does electricity as I need a contractor for other jobs, and most of them don't even come close to how good Mike and his team are.

We had been anticipating the opening of this restaurant for a few months now. We went last Sunday, apparently two days after their doors were open to the public.  We went in around 3 for a late lunch, and as we were greeted the server informed us that they wouldn't have any pho for another hour. Since that's what I usually get at a Vietnamese restaurant we decided to come back another time. As we turned to leave someone told the waitress that it would be ready in half an hour. We decided to give this place a shot.  We ordered egg rolls and their BBQ spring rolls. It took forever for the egg rolls to come, and when we tasted it, it seemed like mystery meat to us. I took a picture and uploaded it. The BBQ spring rolls also took forever to come, but were pretty good. Don't know why food took so long, since there were hardly anyone else there.  Finally the pho was ready so the server came to take our entree orders. We ordered chicken pho and combo grill with chicken, pork, and shrimp on vermicelli noodles (choice of noodles or rice). There were a bunch of dishes that were not available (beef pho, for example) due to their "soft opening". Once again, the food took forever to come out. Normally with pho you get a side dish of basil, bean sprouts, and sometimes cilantro, but nothing came with my pho here. The grilled meat would've tasted good, if only they didn't over cook everything, not to mention that it came with rice (see pic). I inquired with someone there and I think they didn't understand english, so they brought out who we assume was the owner. She said that because it's a soft opening they didn't have noodles. I guess if we were warned that this was a "soft opening" and that they were not fully prepared at all, at least we'd have lower expectations.  We tried to order dessert, and whaddya know, it's not available. Highly likely that we won't be back, even though this is the closest Vietnamese restaurant to us. My first thought was how can they run out of food when the Asian market is a few doors down? Too expensive for what you get, and the dining experience is horrific. The server told us that when they have their grand opening in two weeks or so that things will be much better. I'm not sure I believe that...
