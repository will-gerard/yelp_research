Nina has been doing my nails for well over a year & had never had any issues-  UNTIL YOU TELL HER "Nina" THAT SHE HAS TO FIX SOME THING THAT IS WRONG WITH THE NAILS- my nails were lifting from the underside of my nails less than a week of just having them done- she never removed the old SNS product - HER EXCUSE WAS THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO SAVE ME MONEY -SAVE ME $5.00  not saving  me money if I had pay for replacing  Like I can control the way that the product is applied-  I started out by giving her a call and letting her know that I needed to get in to get them fixed she did not want to talk -she said she was very busy & I said sure I'll call back or she can call me when she was done -she never called me back so before the end of the day I called her made an appointment & came in for my appointment & that's when the problem began-  Nina had proceeded to verbally give me a hard time while she was fixing my nails for all to hear in the shop & she complained the whole time I felt trapped!! She had my nails off  & I didn't want any problems she said she was going to charge me full price & that was fine with me I told her to do whatever she had to do (Mind you I just have them done &paid full price for them less than a week ago) & I was willing to pay that price again so we went on and she fixed the nails & her husband Jerry notice that I was not happy & he asked me what was wrong & I just shook my head as to not start any problems  FYI * I TIP NINA $10.00 EVERY TIME and had GIVEN HER A XMAS BONUS AS WELL  I WILL NEVER BE RETURNING  *First of all when you get your nails done you want to be relaxed not have any tension or any kind of issues with the process *Second of all I don't pay for someone to treat me badly and then TIP them $10 I'll take my business elsewhere don't value her regular long time customers  I suggest you don't use this nail salon

I would give it less than one star if there was an option!! I had an appointment with Dolores and she totally ruined my hair! I had a Kera-Straight put in my hair and she did highlights as well two days later  & she left chemicals in too long resulting in burnt off my hair one inch from my scalp & had massive breakage on right side of my head & along the frame of my face.and I've got pictures to prove it also after color she did not clean off the color that was left around my ears. She did very messy job and I have pictures of that too. My appointment was early in the afternoon didn't leave till two hours after closing and when we did she literally ran to her car so I couldn't ask her what was going on and had the nerve ask me to come back the next day so she can finish up the job!!! My hair was just below my shoulder and now I have chin length hair she does not know what she's doing ! Be warned do not go to Dolores... I will never go again she does not know what she's doing and come to find out they get paid on commission for the services that they do so the more services the more she will get paid that's why she keeps adding on more!
