Fast good quality ingredients with restaurant prices. Typical selection of beers and drinks. The food here deserves a no stars but the the atmosphere is deserving of the star.   I order the Cuban Sandwich which came with a choice of two sides. I choose the fries and the Nightmare Chili. The sandwich was definitely not what I was expecting... I almost want to say they have me the wrong food, but I am not willing to go back to check it out.  The sandwich was much more like a grilled chicken sandwich with poor quality lettuce and tomato. It was  an extremely disappointing dining experience. The sides weren't bad but were also very small portions.  The beer was served in a plastic cup which is not ideal for any situation that isn't poolside.  The atmosphere was the most interesting part of coming here. It is a shame that Alice Cooper would let his restaurant stoop this low. This is definitely a busy model focused around profits and not quality or satisfaction. This restaurant would never survive without its namesake.

Great pizza that is very affordable and they deliver!  Being from Chicago I was hesitant to try New York style pizza again. When I visited the Big Apple all the pizza I had was complete garbage, but Streets of New York has the right stuff. They have a great variety of menu options that could please any pizza lover. Streets of New York just jumped up to the top of my go-to list of places I will order in for pizza. I have been riding the pizza struggle bus ever since I moved out to Phoenix a year and half ago. Until now I had only found solace in very high end pizza restaurants.   This evening we ordered a thin crust pepperoni pizza and the "Flagship Pizza". Both pizzas were great! Streets of New York uses really fresh ingredients to make their pizzas that are quality and it is reflected in the taste of the pizza.  I will definitely be ordering from here again.

Pane Bianco doubles as a fantastic bakery and restaurant. The menu items are made with the freshest of ingredients and delicious. The price is moderately high for lunch but definitely worth it. The decor and interior work wonderfully together to give you a very pleasurable dining experience. The most unique part of the interior is the bar which I was told was salvaged and was formerly an alter. Staff is friendly and knowledgable about the menu, ingredients, and specials.  A little known secret is that Pane Bianco is owned and operated by the same family who owns Pizzeria Bianco and you can get the same exact pizzas here even though they are not listed in the menu. All the same great taste, without any of the downtown wait for a table.  A must try location for anyone in the uptown area.

Jamba Juice. Here is a company whose stock cost me a pretty penny on the market a couple years ago.  Even though this company stock burned me I still come in from time to time to relive the glory days when Jamba was opening up a few new stores around the country every week. The menu has gotten a whole lot bigger since then but it was nice to see they still have a lot of the classics. I found it interesting how similar some of the smoothies taste from menu to menu, but as the prices went up the ingredients became much healthier. I wish I could remember the two smoothies that I am referring to specifically but oh well...  I am giving this Jamba Juice two stars because it is a great representation of why this company will never be great. There is a huge lack in management here. The employees are all super causal and in no way embody Jamba Juice's company character of being a healthy, intelligent and delicious choice. In my experience the employees here have not necessarily been rude, but just unpleasant. The pleasantries go a long way with costumer satisfaction. I have already mentioned how I feel about the smoothie menu above and now its time to tackle the baked goods. Wow. These are just plan bad. The baked goods section is full of wraps, pretzels, etc. that are all pre made from corporate just waiting to be heated up as the costumer come in. Clearly a huge smudge on image of Jamba being a healthy alternative.

Fry's Take-N-Bake pizzas are better than these bad boys and only a 1/4 of the cost.  Last night a good buddy of mine and I had just finished up a long year of teaching and we wanted to celebrate by staying in, stuffing our faces with pizza, having a few beers and watching a movie. The beer was good, the movie was terrible, but the pizza might have been even worse! After ordering a single medium Veggie pizza using the EAT 23 online ordering service the pizza arrived about an hour after placing the order (not bad). The pizza + 10% tip was very pricey, $20 for a single medium pizza.  Most of the veggies on the pizza tasted undercooked and were still dripping water as if they were not properly dried out during prep and through the oven bake. As if the pizza wasn't bad enough, to add insult to injury, my friend had made a Fry's pizza for himself that tasted much better than the pizza I had just dropped $20 on.  I will not be returning here anytime soon.

Traveling through Phoenix Sky Harbor has been one of the best airports I have visited in the US. The airport is very clean, the staff members friendly, there are great food options throughout the airport, and going through security is never a hassle.  Lets face it, no one likes going to the airport, but throughout all of my visits to Sky Harbor I have always had a pleasurable experience. The airport is located very close to downtown and only takes minutes to get to. Since it is so close it is not a hassle for friends to do a quick drop-off or pick-up from the airport. Additionally, a cab fare does not cost very much to get there and if cabs are out of your price range then you can always take the Light Rail to the 44th St. stop. From that stop that Sky Rail takes you straight to your terminal (T5 coming in 2015). I love the location of Sky Harbor and how easy it is to get there.  My favorite part about SH has to be the short wait times at security. Only once have I ever had to wait more than 15 minutes to make it through the entire line. These TSA agents mean business and do their jobs very efficiently. For those with worse luck than me or less patients I would recommend getting TSA Pre-Check approval. This allows you to cut the majority of the line while going through security. Another perk is that you do not have to remove and items from your bag (including laptops, liquids) and you do not have to remove your shoes, belts, or jackets. It is the BEST! If you apply and are approved it is good for 5 years. The app is $85 and you give them permission to do a background cheek and finger printing.  The only reason will not give SH the full five star rating is because I have visited some pretty extravagant airports before in the Middle East that made me realize that most airports in the US are missing a cultural and artistic value. SH does have a number of great artist that have contributed to its design but nothing that was breath taking like I have seen elsewhere.  Great airport! Four stars!

Farm At South Mountain is such a gift to the city of Phoenix. As a public school teacher, I often stress to my students the importance of eating healthier and more sustainable local foods. It is wonderful to have such a great farm so close to town so that children can see that food should be grown from the ground and that it doesn't just come from packaging. I would love to take my students here one day for a field trip to walk the grounds.  I came here with a large group of friends for brunch. The wait for our large group was a little over an hour but the time went by quickly as we walked around the many shops and fields. The restaurant also has plenty of water and iced tea available for patrons as they waited for their table.  I really enjoyed roaming the grounds here and dining with my friends. Most of us really enjoyed our meals, but the waffle I had was not worth it. Everyone else's entrees looked much better than mine. I cannot wait to come back here to try other dishes.

I was so happy to find an Asian market nearby that had a true selection of products to choose from. This place is the real deal! They have everything you would expect from a traditional Asian market, bakery, butcher, produce, frozen, dairy, seafood, household items and more! The place is huge and is actually kept pretty nice - unlike many Asian markets in the US. Almost all the checkout lanes were open which made for a speed exit once we had finished our shopping.  I will definitely be coming back to Lee Lee's in the future!

I came out to Casino Arizona for the first time this weekend and I had a great time with my friends playing midnight BINGO, eating and drinking. The midnight BINGO was a pretty solid time. The cards are very affordable and give you plenty of opportunity to win a few hundred dollars on each card you buy. If you come out for BINGO be sure to keep your receipt! As an unknowing first time player I threw mine and my SO's away. Thankfully the manager working, Monica, was super accommodating and offered to reissue our receipts. She even sent me back to my table so I could continue playing my first card and delivered the receipts herself. Thanks again Monica!! BINGO was a great deal of fun but there was also a decent amount of down time between rounds that would allow you to go to the bathroom, grab a fresh drink or even a bite to eat. All of the food and drinks were very affordable (most under $5). There is also a dance floor in room so you and your friends can go out there and bust a move!  I would love to come back another time to play BINGO again and try my hand at a few card games.

Yes! This place was awesome! It is hard to find great asian food in Phoenix but this place does it right. They had fantastic Vietnamese crepes and macarons. If you check in on yelp you get a free drink that is good for up to $4. This place is a great deal. A hearty meal for two is under $30.

Char's Has the Blues is a Central Phoenix gem! One of the only places in town you can go to to find find great live music and a hopping dance floor any night of the week. Mondays are open for anyone who is brave enough to step up to the mic with the band. Often on the weekend the place is packed! Lots of great music and good times on the dance floor.  To improve the seen I would love to see a few different beers offered on tap or even in bottle for a better price. ~$5 basic drinks on a Monday are a little steep.  I am excited to come here more often to get to know the bands better. This place is all about the music.

Not your average take-out joint!  The Burger Factory has a large menu with lots of variety choose from. Although their are burgers are delicious, and come in many forms, they also have many other delicious menu items that are worth trying. They have everything from burgers, burritos, gyros, and everything in between. I would recommend guacamole burger.   The staff members are very friendly and want to make sure that you have a pleasurable dining experience.  The interior is typical of a fast food restaurant and probably below average but does not detract at all from the experience as a whole.

This was by far the greasiest pizza I've ever come across in my life. The grease is literally pooled onto the slices of pizza.  Given that this restaurant has a four star rating I would assume the other food is pretty good, but I will not be returning to find out.   Not recommended for anyone that is into Midwestern pizza.

Methinks not... but the employees were awesome and they do serve $1 PBRs.   Mill is not known for having great food options and Fatburger lives up to that reputation. The burger patty was very surprising thin. This chain must have gone down hill pretty fast after their rapid expansion. The prices are a little much for what you get. I would at least expect the bun and other ingredients to have been fresh, but I was disappointed.  Try eating elsewhere!

Classic Vine. I found great solace here at the Vine as an alumni from the University of Iowa who moved out to Phoenix shortly after graduation. There are only 4 Vines that I know of any where around the country. Two located in the Iowa City area and two in the Great Phoenix region. I lived on ASU's campus for training during the first two months when I moved here. I was so happy to find a great local Iowa City bar's sister to be located right across the street. It really took me back to my college days since the atmosphere, food and drinks are all so similar.  This Vine location even has the upper hand on the Iowa City location since it is such a bigger venue. The food here is all your typical bar food and everything taste good and is very affordable. I personally am a huge fan of the wings here. They have such a great variety of sauces for you to try from.   Pro-tip: Come Thursdays for Karaoke Night. The host has a huge selection, but he loves playing the classics more than anything.

Jerry's is all about convenience. It might not be the nicest store in town, or have the greatest selection, but it is close to campus and they even offer a drive thru assistance for costumes that are in a hurry. Yelpers should know that when you shop at Jerry's you are paying for convenience over all else.

Holy Smokes! This place sets the bar high for what is cool. Any other establishment would be suffering from a major identity crisis if they tried to simultaneously function as a coffee shop, bakery, restaurant, and bar but Lux somehow does it all and does it right! If you are someone who likes working at a table with strangers (as most tables or couches will be full by the time you get there), loud music and the temptation to drink booze rather than coffee, Lux is the place for you!!  I love showing my friends from out of town this place in hopes they will fall in love with Lux, quit their jobs, leave their families and move into Phoenix!  Personally, I am nowheres cool enough to hangout here on a regular basis. The DJ plays his music too loud, I can never find an open table, and I always fall a fool to the temptation of to sipping down the nectar of me people, Templeton Rye. Iowa Represent!! But even with all that up against me, I still stop by at the Lux very so often to remind me how much of a basic b*tch I actually am. LOVE THIS PLACE!

The interior design of FEZ is in poor taste and trying of a very modern restaurant. The whole design felt very forced and was completely lost on the patio. Several tables on the patio have no proper lighting whatsoever and are extremely ill placed. The dinner menu does seem to have some interesting options.  I ordered the curry and was not disappointed, however, of course there are much better options for curry in the area for half the price.  The most disappointing part of the meal was the margaritas drink special. The drinks were cheap but also the worst margaritas I've ever ordered. I would be very skeptical of order another mix drink from this restaurant.  Several friends have suggested this restaurant is much better for brunch than dinner.

Tasteless and bland foods that will send you to an early grave. The food here is so bad that it completely detracts from the romanticism behind the idea of dining out and watching a movie at the same time. The food here is seriously bad and expensive. As if paying for bad food with your wallet wasn't bad enough you will also be paying for this food on the treadmill because just about every dish is within a short range of 1000 calories! Keep a careful eye out for the calorie listings on the menu if you go in. Terrible and unhealthy foods aside, I must say it wouldn't be a bad place to go for a dessert. I would not recommend going here for drinks though, since they are so expensive.  Friendly and attentive employees and waitstaff.

Lenny's does a great job paying homage to the classic 1950's American diner. Lenny's is an old-fashioned burger joint complete with countertop bar and the classic red booths and seating. I am giving Lenny's a 2/5 stars because I have tried several of their locations and I have been underwhelmed each time. I think there are several better burger joints nearby in town that have a competitive price and better quality.  In my experiences here the service has been fairly slow for the level of quality that is delivered... The atmosphere is class and should never change but I think it's time Lenny's reconsiders their ingredients and recipe.

This Fry's Food & Drug Store has to be one of the worst in the valley. This part of town does not have very many options as far as grocery stores go. This neighborhood has been striving to make improvements to keep with with the rest of the down town area but this Fry's stands a a testament that we still have a long way to go as a community. Most grocery stores to do not want to have business in neighborhoods with as high of crime rates as this part of town has so it makes competition far and few between. With so few choices most people in town are forced to shop at this location, which is a shame because so few of the costumer or employees treat it with any respect. One can find a much nicer Fry's Store just a few minutes away across from Whole Foods and Trader Joes. A clear sign that Fry's Stores does not care about this location because the people in this part of town do not have any other choice. We deserve better. A shake up in management and reinvesting profits back into the store would do wonders for this location.

Quite literally the worst experience I've ever had taking my car into a shop.  A few weeks ago I found myself desperate for an oil change. This was the first place I called that could get me in the same day and it is fairly close to my office. As I pulled up I had a feeling that I should've just immediately left  - the place looks scary from the outside and the barbed wire fence is extremely uninviting. I went against my gut feeling and I decided to take my appointment as scheduled and boy do I regret it!  After giving them the keys to my car and waiting patiently for 45 minutes one of the "technicians" came out to the waiting area and asked for my assistance in the back to take a look at my hood. After changing my oil he must have tried closing the hood while there was something blocking it from shutting. My hood no longer closed properly and was roughly a 1/4" off. To fix this cost me $200 at the Infiniti body-shop.  As if that wasn't bad enough, less than a day after my oil change I noticed my car was leaking oil! I took it in the Infiniti maintenance center for an inspection and they told me that my oil pan has been punctured. Another $200 repair.  In total their poorly done oil change ended up costing me over $430 for their fee and the repairs.  Do not trust these people with your car!

One of the best restaurants I have been to in the Valley! Conveniently located in uptown Phoenix, St. Francis is a very attractive destination for any couple or group looking for a nice restaurant to spend the evening. I enjoyed the drinks and suggested wine pairings for the three course meal they were serving during the Restaurant Week celebration here in town. Everyone on staff is extremely knowledgable and friendly. I love going to a restaurant with waiters that are knowledgable and who are invested in the success of the restaurant.  The cheesy bruschetta, chilled potato and leek soup, roman hearts salad are all excellent appetizers that I would recommend. The green pork chili verde is a savory and spicy entree. I have also tried the marinated flank steak, which was served a little over cooked and just okay at best. I am sure there are better, more affordable options on the menu.  As for desserts, I have enjoyed both the strawberry shortcake and the sticky toffy pudding. Both were extremely pleasant and the perfect way to end a great dining experience.

Affordable and delicious bubble tea!!  I was so happy to have finally found a milk tea restaurant in town that I actually enjoy. The milk tea has plenty of boba and was very milky and sweet. I loved it! The inside of Boba Tea House is also pretty nice. It is not over crowded with tables and couches like some other boba restaurants. It is a very comfortable place to come to hangout and kill an hour of your time. The employees all seemed super nice and were very prompt to greet us upon our arrival. The service was also very speedy. I will for sure be back the next time I find myself in Chandler.

Great location, staff, atmosphere, specials, and service.  All of my visits to this restaurant have been pleasurable experiences. It is a great place to go with friends after work, with family or even take a date. The patio atmosphere and the inside make for a very versatile restaurant. It is conveniently located in uptown Phoenix and is easy to hit from the lightrail. The staff is very young, fun and knowledgable.

Yum!!  I love running to this place for lunch. Two Hippies Beach House is one of many treasures unique to Central Phoenix. This restaurant is easy to miss as you drive by on Camelback but you will never forget how lovely the atmosphere is once you stop in. The place is very well decorated in a unique fashion that supports the theme of the restaurant. The prices are cheap and the food is great! This place really can make a mean quesadilla. I love the quesadillas here because they offer a wide variety of toppings and meats. My favorite topping is the cabbage. Cabbage on a quesadilla?!?! Yep! It's fantastic! You gotta try it.  Two Hippies is a must!

This Walmart location currently holds the award for worst Walmart in America. This store not only is a horrible place to shop and work (I will have to imagine), but it is also a total poison for the surrounding community. So many disgusting people are attracted to this Walmart location. Shopping here makes me feel really good about myself. I have never felt so beautiful before I started shopping here. The Wal-Creatures at this store are real and they are scary! I would highly recommend not shopping here after dark or ever for that matter. There is a Target on the other side of the complex that you won't be murdered at.

Why would I go anywhere else for wine and bruschetta?  Tuesday. You. Me. And all the wine and cheesy & bread goodness you can imagine. Postinos is the place to be during the week. This place offers a great ambience that is perfect for any celebration or casual evening out with good friends. The wine is selection is great and the food even better. On Tuesday evenings the deal is $20 for a board of 4 types of bruschetta and a bottle of wine. The deal equates to huge savings over any other night of the week. You will not be disappointed!  Postinos is a must try for anyone is the Central or downtown Phoenix area.

Very cool people work at this Dutch brothers location. The staff members friendliness and kindness is better than the actual coffee. The coffee and drinks themselves are not bad by any means, but any emotional attachment to this location is derived from the staff members only.  They are great at making you feel like a special and welcome customer each time you come for your morning or afternoon cup of coffee. I would highly recommend stopping here if this is on your way to work.

Best selection of wines, beers, and liquors out of anywhere in town. They also have the best prices! I am a huge fan of this place and hate buying liquor from anywhere else. They have a great selection, very friendly and helpful staff members, and constantly have tasting going on.  If you have not been to Total Wine before you have to check them out.

I am very saddened by the fact that they have moved locations. This was a great and convenient location for my commute home from work. I'll be stopping in every now and then at the new location but I'll be missing my (almost) weekly stop.     Very friendly and welcoming staff members coupled with a nice indoor and patio dining area make for a very enjoyable dining experience.  The food is very reasonably priced and delicious. The portion sizes are a little smaller than I am used to, but preferred to the unnecessarily huge portions found at other nearby Mexican restaurants.  I would highly recommend the carne asada torta sandwich. I tried it after reading another user's review and I was not disappointed. The horchata is also some of the best I've had in town.  I have never enjoyed their happy hour specials but it seems like great deal with Mexican beers available for just $2.

I am giving this Subway a 5-Star rating based on the experience that I had here based on the staff and the cleanliness of the store. These guys and gals on staff do a great job of taking care of the lunch rush and making sure everyone gets through the line within a reasonable amount of time. This is greatly appreciated by someone who has a strict 45 minutes lunch break.  A lot of people have said some pretty terrible things about this shopping center and this Subway in particular, but I think they are a little extreme. It is true that this Subway is located in a rougher part of town, but I have never been harassed in the parking lot by beggars on my way in and out of Subway. If it is something that you are that worried about I would suggest parking right next to the door. The store itself has always been very clean. Subway management does a pretty good job of making sure the back rooms and the dining area remain well attended to.  For a Subway, this place isn't all bad. It is a quick, cheap, and friendly way to grab lunch on the go.

They made me a lifelong customer today! Such great service and knowledgeable and friendly technicians.  I called in this afternoon to have my muffler looked at because it has been making a very loud rattling noise. They said I could bring it in anytime and they would take a look at it. Upon my arrival they promptly took my keys and drove my car to the lift. After a quick welding job the problem was taken care of.  The technician was very nice and said there'd be no charge for his services today since it was such a quick fix. I will definitely be back in the future. Thank you so much!

Pretty dirty place, but drunk food is drunk food. I was very excited to see that they say they offer Kingfisher Beer, a classic Indian beer, on the menu, but I was super disappointed to find out they did not have any in stock.

Most pretzels from Auntie Ann's are very greasy and over salted. The aroma coming from the store location is overpowering and unappealing.  However, there is one pretzel that I do thoroughly enjoy from Auntie Ann's. That pretzel would be the sour cream and onion pretzel with the hot salsa cheese. The two make for a great combo! I would highly recommend giving it a try.  If you're ordering a specialty pretzel, ask for a pretzel that is unsalted. This will ensure that they make you a fresh pretzel! You can then salt the pretzel yourself if you desire.  The pretzel bites are good for a group, however, not the best value.

I had a very unfortunate experience here at La Petite France. I came here for restaurant week and I was really looking forward to my meal after reading all these reviews. I have only traveled in France briefly in my time but it was enough to know that I love French cuisine. Unfortunately I was meet with disappointment while eating here.  After placing a reservation for our meal we arrived early only to find that all of the inside tables were being occupied by two large parties. As compensation we were offered an extremely small and awkward table that is located immediately next to the main entrance of the restaurant or a table on the patio. Given the awkwardness of the remaining in-house table we choose to bear the evening chill and sit outdoors. It was evident that the staff had made a mistake and felt badly for it but they danced around the subject for the remainder of the evening rather than apologize. As the odds would have it I ordered the three smallest dishes on the menu. I could not actually believe how small these plates were. I ordered the Le Panier de Tomatoes Rouge, Escargot, the Scallops, and the Red Fruit Sabayon for dessert (all photos of these can be found above courtesy of Mary F). The only dish of these that was memorable was the escargot. The others were truly lacking in flavor and had nothing to savor.  I paid $40 to be cold and hungry.

What a treat to have such a fantastic Cambodian restaurant in the heart of downtown Phoenix! A must try for anyone in town that as a palate for eastern cuisine.  I would highly recommend the curry soup. The broth is savory with a hint of coconut milk and a few other delicious spices. The dish contains chicken, carrots, potatoes, green beans, and a few other veggies. The dish comes with rice but I needed to order a second bowl in order to properly enjoy this meal. A must try!

Another great restaurant from the Upwards Projects team. I had been to Churn multiple times and always wanted to check out the food and patio next-door over at the Windsor. They have a great patio and happy hour special. The ambience of this place is very relaxing and welcoming. It is a perfect place to come after work with friends or co-workers to grab a beer and chill. They have plenty of beers and mixed drinks to choose from and menu options.  I started with an order of the Russian Roulettes. The menu description reads, "Seasonal peppers sautéed in lemon & olive oil. Some are hot & some are not!" My table loved the appetizer. Delicious peppers with just the right about of seasoning and spice. The rest of the menu consists of sandwiches and burgers. I had The Berkeley black bean burger and it was great.   I cannot wait to come back here again to explore more of the menu and enjoy that beautiful patio.

Going to Churn is always such a treat! (no pun intended). This desert/ice cream parlor has all the right stuff to make it a grade-A establishment. The staff members are very welcoming upon your arrival, they are happy to let you sample any flavor, or give you a recommendation. Having a great staff who are happy to be at work is key to an establishments success! These guys really pull it off well. Enough about them, let's talk about the good stuff. I have never had a flavor of ice cream here that I did not enjoy, or a treat that did not satisfy. Their homemade ice cream is some of the best in town! I personally love getting their chocolate malts.  5-Stars. You will not be disappointed.

No equipment upkeep and most of the boats need maintenance.  I have been here twice in the past, once for paddle boarding and once for what would have been a very romantic date had the row boat we rented been operational.   The paddle boarding equipment was completely fine and not a bad deal at $20 for an hour and a half ride.  The row boats however are in serious need of maintenance. The affixed oars are hardly attached and nearly impossible to use. This made moving around in the water extremely difficult, especially when navigating up stream. Upon returning the boat to the dock I informed the docker of the boat's need of repairs. He replied, "They are much more concerned with Greenbacks here than costumer satisfaction..." He didn't seem happy about it either and it was disheartening to see the docker care more about costumer satisfaction that the management.

Food: The food I have had here was fantastic! I was here just the other night and had the shrimp pizza. It was delicious! Great pizza dough and high quality ingredients. I had never come to Copper Blues before for the food but I was very pleasantly surprised to see that they actually had a very extensive food menu and the kitchen is open LATE! I will have to come back here in the future to try more of their food. I have also tried the fries with ketchup and sriracha ranch sauce. These were killer!  Service: I was disappointed to see so many Yelpers who have had terrible costumer service here. Every time I have been here the staff has been nothing but helpful and accommodating. The bar is always packed, no matter which of the three you are at, but I seem to always be served in a timely manner. Last time I was here I had placed an order for pizza and then almost immediately changed my mind on what toppings I wanted and as soon as I told the waitress she ran to go change the order. She was awesome! I wish I would have gotten her name so I could give her a shout out. I also really appreciate the staff's commitment to the themed parties that are held here. I have been around several times when everyone on staff is dressed in costume to go along with the night's party theme. The entire bar is also very well staffed. bartenders and waiters everywhere to help serve you.  Atmosphere: On friday night this place is rocking! There are always tons of people that come out to chill and watch the live music on that iconic stage behind the bar. Copper Blues also has a pretty awesome selection of beers on draft for you to choose from. Anyone can come here and have a good time!

My friends and I frequent the Crescent Ballroom because of all the great shows that come in here to play and the great atmosphere in the front room and patio.  This is a great place to come for a show or just to hang out and grab some food or drinks. There is always something awesome to check out here no matter what day of the week. Most of the shows do have some sort of cost, but it is usually worth the price. I have seen tons of shows here in the past and had a wonderful time. The venue is very personal and offers a wide array of options for you to enjoy the show, including lots of standing room, high table tops, and stadium blenchers in the back. Inside the venue there are conveniently located bathrooms, the merch table and a bar.  Drinks - The bottled beer selection here is pretty decent but the draft selection of beers is very limited. I would recommend sticking to hard liquor here. The Vodka Sodas here are some of the best and strongest in town. After just three of these drinks you will be feeling very good. They also carry a personal favorite of mine, Templeton Rye whiskey. A glass on the rocks will run you $10, but it is well worth it.  Food - I have heard many good things about the food from the Crescent, but I have only ever ordered the nachos.  These nachos are awesome though! They are delicious but expensive at ~$13. However, they can easily feed 2-4 people so the cost is not that bad unless you are the one treating the table. I am very interested in coming here during the day to try other food. Most of the menu is extremely affordable and sounds delicious, especially for a concert venue.  Staff/Service - I have only been here at night, but it is pretty typical not to receive any sort of table service if you are at the front room or on the patio. I would recommend ordering all drinks and food up at the bar. The bar staff are super nice and work quickly to get everyone's order taken care of. If you are ordering food they will give you a card to bring back to your table so someone else can deliver your food.  I love the Crescent Ballroom and it is by far one of my favorite spots in town. If you like live music you have to give this place a try. The staff, drinks, food or music will not disappoint you. This concert venue and bar has a great vibe!

I love coming into N-Counter for brunch on the weekends. The food is great and there are a lot of menu options to choose from. I have only tried the poached eggs dish and the scrabbled eggs with potatoes, toast, and bacon. Both dishes are great and simple. I am excited to go back and try something a little more adventurous on the menu the next time I am in town.   I have been to a couple other breakfast spots on Mill Ave and N-Counter is by far the best. They have a great menu to choose from, a bar with decent drinks, speedy service, and a beautiful interior. You walk in and place your order at the counter, so this is not a traditional sit down restaurant. I would suggest having someone in your dining party grab a table while someone else places the order.  Tip: I would highly recommend trying the Arizona Gunslinger hot sauce they have. It is awesome!

This place is pretty average for a Chinese restaurants in Phoenix. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but when you go in the dining area itself is very nice. The hostess and other staff members were very welcoming. The food itself was nothing special. I had the Yu-chan chicken. The dish was very spicy - I nice surprise! The dish was okay, but I could tell that very poor ingredients were used in its making.  When I originally called to place my order they notified me that it would be a 50 minutes for delivery. This was very surprising because my order only included 2 dishes and I live just 5 blocks away.... I was even more surprised when I went into pick up my order and found that I was the only person there. The driver must have already been out when I called.   The menu doesn't seem to have anything enticing or unique to the restaurant. Even though it was an enjoyable dining experience, I do not see myself coming back here anytime soon. There are just so many other options in the area to try before I would give this place another try.

Great juicy burgers and amazing fries at a great value! Five Guys is the standard I set for any burger or fries I eat elsewhere. The staff is friendly and quick with your order. The place is clean, with lots of wooden tables for seating. There's also tables and umbrellas outside for additional seating. This store also has fancy Coke machines.   The food here is delicious and reasonably priced. I will definitely be back for more!

I just came back from my first massage from Snapp Therapeutics and I will definitely be recommending this place to my friends! Not only was it a great, very relaxing massage, but it was also SUPER affordable. Check out the Yelp Check-in Offer when you arrive! I was able to have a 50 minutes massage for just $25. It was a great deal! James did a wonderful job of greeting me at the door and asking me exactly what areas I would like him to focus on and the kind of massage I was looking to receive.  There is a beautiful and warm waiting room to greet guests as they enter. Complete with various magazines and a few big comfy couches. The entire building is very well designed and visually appealing. I especially enjoyed the room I had my massage in. The room has great blinds to keep most natural light out and only a very dim lamp was on in the room. This absence of light combined with the soothing sounds of relaxing music made for a great environment to receive a massage.  I will definitely be coming back in the future.

Another great burger chain! I love seeing quality fast food burger joints pop up all around the city and the country. These establishments have a cornered out a great segment in the market and have tons of potential for growth in the coming years.   I tried The Habit after reading an article online that surveyed costumers from all around the country as to which high-end burger joints would they most want to move into a city near them. To my surprise is was not In-N-Out or Five Guys at the top of the list - it was The Habit. Having never heard of them before I was delighted to find that we here in Phoenix are lucky enough to have one in out downtown area. As soon as I got my food I could clearly see what all the fuss online was about. This burger rocks! Most notably The Habit uses really fresh ingredients, the cheese is perfect and tasty, and the onions are grilled to perfection and plentiful. I order a side of fries and a chocolate malt to accompany my burger. The fries were nothing special. I was really expecting a whole lot more and was disappointed to find how basic they were. However, the chocolate malt was the best I have had all summer! I would highly recommend giving The Habit a try the next time you are downtown.

What a great addition to the uptown community! Twirl is a frozen yogurt restaurant in uptown Phoenix that really knows how to deliver a great froyo experience. They have a rotating "tap" on what flavors of froyo they offer and a wide variety of fresh fruits and candies to sprinkle on the top of your delicious treat. Twirl, like most other froyo restaurants, is a self-service restaurant that charges by the ounce. I love their products and the atmosphere of the restaurant. It is very comforting and welcoming. A great place to go kill an hour on a weeknight!

Great place to come and have a beer during the week. They have a fantastic selection of beers and a decent happy hour special. This place has a pretty unique vibe that lets it stand out from most of the other bars that are downtown on Mill Ave. The patio area is a perfect spot to grab a beer and relax with friends no matter what time of year. The place gets pretty rowdy on the weekends but its still a pretty cool joint.

Zookz is a fantastic untraditional sandwich and salad restaurant in uptown Phoenix.  I have had several of their breakfast & lunch sandwiches and salads from here before and I just keep on coming back for more. This place rocks! The inside is extremely well kept and visually appealing. The staff members are all friendly and are prompt to help you with any questions you may have about the menu. These guys work pretty quickly too in order to get you your food in a timely manner. The menu itself is pretty extensive too. Sometimes I would prefer shops like this to specialize in one type of product but their business model works (and taste) great! So much so that they close pretty early around 3 o'clock on the daily. I have loved all the menu items I have tried here.  If you find yourself in uptown for lunch you have to give Zookz a try!

One of the best dinning and takeout options in uptown. Federal Pizza has a beautiful interior and patio. Unsurprisingly the menu is mostly pizza but they also offer some variety in the form of pastas, sandwiches and salads. Dining in is a great experience and the take out is quick and just as delicious. I prefer dining in because they have a great happy hour special.   The Big Star pizza is a must try for anyone who looking for something completely unique. It is my favorite menu item complete with all the veggies and meats one could ask for. Perfection! I have also had the Manifesto and Casanova. Both of which were also very good. As far as appetizers the green olives and the avocado are also great choices.

That's a spicy meatball! Or in Gadzooks' case an enchilada. They do enchiladas and they do them very well. There are tons of different combinations of mixings and ingredients you can choose from to build your own enchilada. Tons of different meats, sauces, and veggies to choose from. You could really try a new flavor combination every time you go in. The atmosphere here and the patio make for a great time. They also have several bottled beers available for purchase that would compliment your meal very well. The staff members here were also very nice and helpful to my friends and I when we told them this was our first visit. The cashier even brought us over samples of the various meets so we could try each type.   I really enjoyed this place and I am looking forward to trying more of their food in the future.

Very simple and clean menu. This place specializes in a handful of items and them do them all very well. I had driven past here a million times and always wanted to go in and I regret waiting this long. I tried the cheese burger, chocolate shake, and fries. Each item was great. The shake was much better than most I have tried around town. The burger was fantastic! perfect ingredients and meat all served on a fresh bun (which might have been a Hawaiian bun). My only complaint would be that it took me 15 minutes to get through the drive thru even though there were only 2 cars ahead of mine.  I will definitely be back and go inside sometime!

Shabby restaurant, basic food, and poor service. A group of a friends and I came here after being turned off of two very popular breakfast joints in town because of the hour long wait. We decided to head back to central Phoenix where we live and give this old shack a try. The Melrose Kitchen looks like it was furnished by one of the many surrounding "antique" stores. The tables and chairs are cramped and uncomfortable. The menu is uninspired and built around what is easy to prepare rather than the quality expertise of the chefs and owners. I tried a few bites from everyone's entree and was disappointed all around. The french fries were over cooked and very greasy. When someone asked for the mayo on their sandwich to be put on the side the server some how thought my friend wanted a double serving of mayo on the sandwich. The biscuits  from the biscuits and gravy were more like dried bread made from pancake batter. The omelets do have a wide variety of ingredients to choose from, however, the eggs were very over cooked and made the dish very over cooked and unenjoyable. The service was very awkward. Often the servers did not understand what we were saying or what we were trying to order. There were several little annoyances that occurred throughout the meal but the worst was how they brought out our 5 meals. Each dish came out one at a time. This always is a little annoying but Melrose Kitchen made it so much worse. There was a good 7 minutes between when the first dish was brought out from when the last guest got their food.  I will not be coming back.

Do they play country music most of the time? Yes. Do they have a mechanical bull? Yes. Do they have two-step dancing? Yes. But are they a country bar? Not exactly...  Moonshine is definitely a country bar with a college town twist. They have a great dance floor and most people are doing the two-step and doing it well. Makes me wish I learned more as a kid. The bar also has plenty of bar staff to help you get a drink in a timely manner. This is the best place to go just off Mill to have a good time. They are also open on the weekend till 3 am.  Check it out!

Chick-Fil-A always seems to have some of the best costumer service anywhere in town. I recently came in here with my pops for a quick bite to eat and we were greeted the moment we walked into the door. The cashier was super patient with us, being that we had no idea what to order. He was so nice to use the entire time we were there. I wish I would have gotten his name and given him a compliment to his manager.  Our food was served to us very shortly after placing our order, which was almost troubling since I did not think they had time to make it properly, but it was fantastic. I would love to go here more often.

Very friendly staff with a great drink selection!  I am definitely a fan of this location. The staff members and atmosphere of this place are great. Everyone I have meet on staff has been really kind and knowledgeable of the products they brew and whatever is on tap. I love being able to talk beer and coffee with these guys. The business also has lots of great and unique items on sale around the shop. The Refuge owes its name this artwork and crafts on sale. They are products made from local refuges that are looking to showcase their skills and culture with the Phoenix community in hopes of making a little extra cash for themselves. Depending on what they have to showcase you can find some really great items for sale.  The Refuge is a great place to go for a coffee or a drink to get some work done. They have a large meeting room in the back that you can book with the guys up front that is perfect for accommodating a meeting of +10. They also have lots of fun board games available to sit and play with your pals.  A great location to go for work or to kill a few hours of time.

Best sushi in Phoenix! I have been let down by several sushi restaurants here in the valley before but Harumi will definitely not disappoint! It is a very casual restaurant that is great for lunch and dinner. Several reviews here suggested that the food here is far superior to the casual atmosphere, which may have some merit behind it, however, I think the casual ambience is one of the best aspects of this restaurant. Remaining a casual restaurant allows anyone to come in for a casual lunch or singles or couples to stop in for dinner without having to make a whole night out of it.   Chef Juno and his team are very skilled at their craft. As for the wait staff, I think they could use a little more training and a refresher on their knowledge of menu.  Tonight we checked-in on Yelp and received a free order of miso soup and edamame. Both were delicious! For our entires we ordered the H3 roll and the Oh My God roll. The H3 had a great spicy kick. The Oh My God roll is served on a flaming plate and wrapped in tinfoil. It is quite a sight to see! This is a must try for anyone who has not been here before. It is very savory and smokey roll that will satisfy any craving.  For dessert I was considering the green tea ice cream tempura, but before we could order Juno sent an order of the green tea mochi on the house. He is so nice to his costumers! The mochi was good, but I would have liked to have tried it without the chocolate sauce.  I would highly recommend Harumi for anyone who is looking for a great casual sushi restaurant.

I had a great time here hanging out with my friends. We came here over the weekend to enjoy the $20 all you can play Labor Day deal. The package came with unlimited bowling, laser tag, pool, shuffle board, and the ropes course. The laser tag here is awesome! No basic troubles with the guns or vests working properly and the course is two levels! The scheduling staff was very helpful and mad ensure that my party had something to do the entire time we were there. In addition to the previously mentioned this Main Event location also has a ton of new arcade games, a full bar, kitchen and a pizza restaurant. Although I personally did not eat anything while we were there the food all looked pretty typically of what I would expect from an establishment like the Main Event.  Pretty cool place. I wish this location also had the rock climb wall and the mini golf that is listed on their main website.

Edit: This location has now been open for several months and my previous grievances has been resolved.  It's now a pleasure to come here in the mornings and my order is always filled in a timely manner.   I was delighted when I found out this Starbucks location was opening. I work down the street so I thought this would become a regular stop for me on my morning commute.  The employees of this location have all been very nice and welcoming, however, the morning crew really needs a stronger manager to be working with them. I stopped frequenting this location because of the snail like pace of the service. No matter if I go through the drive thru or walk into the store the team can never complete my order in a timely manner.  The order I am having trouble with consists of a medium coffee and a breakfast sandwich. Obviously the coffee is given to me immediately, but the breakfast sandwich has always taken at least 15 minutes to get to me and usually cold. Somehow my order always seems to get lost amongst the employees.

This looks like a great addition to uptown Phoenix! As an educator, it warms my heart to have a bookstore open up so close to the school I work at. I will for sure be informing my students about any future upcoming events going on here in the year to come. Once this location is fully operational they will also be accepting used books and selling them on the shelves. There is nothing I love more than sharing a great book with friends and community members. It is so important to have a great, fully stocked book store in town.  This location also double as a coffee and drink bar. In the coming months they will be greatly expanding the available seating area so you own't just have to work at the bar. I am very excited to see what becomes of this store and the other available retail space at the Newton Shopping Center.

I was very happy when the first two Portilo's store locations opened up in Phoenix. I am a Chicagoland native who loves to share a great causal meal with friends at these restaurants.  The following will be borrowed from a previous location that I have reviewed. It will be several of my favorite foods from the menu. Enjoy!   Roast Beef Sandwich. One of the best roast beefs in town. I would recommend getting it with mozzarella cheese, hot peppers, double dipped in gravy. It's a fantastic meal! For those with a serious appetite, try ordering the Big Beef. It's twice the sandwich for only a little more.   Jumbo Hotdog with everything on it. A Jumbo all beef hotdog with onion, relish, tomato, hot peppers, mustard, and a speared pickle. This is the epitome of the Chicago Hotdog! A must try! I recommend ordering two.  Fresh Chopped Salad. Ditalini pasta, crumbled bacon, romaine and iceberg lettuce, red cabbage, tomatoes, onion, gorgonzola cheese, chopped chicken, with a great blend of spices.  Now a few things that I would stay clear of... The Cake Shake and the Malts. The Cake Shake take a piece of their famous chocolate cake and blends it with a chocolate shake. It is WAY too much chocolate for a desert. I would only order this if you have a serious sweet tooth. As for the Malts, they are seriously lacking with the malt power and you can get a better Malt elsewhere in town.
