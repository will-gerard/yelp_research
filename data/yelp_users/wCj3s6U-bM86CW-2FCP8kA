1.5 Stars  I don't understand why this place has good reviews.  I usually trust YELP but this place was horrible.  The food was very blan and overcooked.  I had a tamale and chili relleno combo with rice and beans.  There was no texture to the food and everything had the same taste.  I would head to Frank and Lupes for some decent Mexican food.  I will not be going back to Los Olivos.

I don't understand how this place only has 3 stars.  I went for the first time last night and it was delicious.  Plus the atmosphere is very cool and trendy.  The specialty rolls are really unique and tasty.  The only thing I could complain about is that some rolls only have 4 pieces.  I'll definitely go back here again.  Get the Viva Las Vegas Roll.  It's amazing!

Absolutely Delicious!  My husband and I went this past weekend with friends.  We started off with the cornbread and artichoke appetizers.  the cornbread is to die for!  Hands down the best corn bread I've ever had with little jalapeño bits to add just a little spiciness.  I had the Tuna as my entrée and was not disappointed.  For dessert we had the oreo cookie sandwiches.  Amazing!  I left feel stuffed but satisfied.  It was worth ever calorie.  =)         Also, my husband didn't order any wine but our friends who are total "wine-os" informed us that they barely mark up their wines.  Awesome food.  Awesome Deal!

I just moved to Scottsdale and found Salon Ami on Yelp.  I made an appointment with Ashley Scott and she was Great!  I really like my haircut and color and she was super friendly.  The salon is really cute, conveniently located, and not pretentious at all.

Pearl hits the spot.  They have an all day happy hour menu with $2 beers, $4 rolls (CA roll, spicy tuna roll, etc) and $6 specialty rolls.  The sushi is good, not spectacular, but for the price its a great sushi restaurant.
