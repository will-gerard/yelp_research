The bruschetta was good as always, but the artichoke and bean dips were blah and the bread was hard enough to tear up my mouth. We asked for softer French bread they say sure and brought us 3 slices! When asked for more they brought us a bowl of the hard stuff, it was quite frustrating since the service overall was bad for us. We had a server who left right after taking our initial drink order and no new server took us on. We had to flag someone new every time we needed or wanted something since no one came to check on us and that was including our food order.  I plan to stick to the one in central from now on. I've always had excellent service there.

Horrible service. Very disorganized.   It first started in the parking lot which cannot accommodate the number of customers for the plaza. So show up early and expect to have parking wars. Took me close to 20 mins and settled for an illegal spot by the dumpster. We made a reservation for 7:30 and weren't seated until 8:30. Finally ate around 9. When we asked initially when we would be seated no one could give us a time and the manager dismissed our complaint.   To top it off a bartender asked why the other was miffed and she said "it's nothing, just that bitch wants water" as I saw her to deliver it to my cousin. I confronted her about it and she tried to play it off saying "oh I wasn't talking about her", uh huh. Horrible horrible experience for overpriced okay teppanyaki

I walked in this week as it was really time for me to get adjusted. They were able to squeeze me in for an adjustment/new patient exam.   Dr. Shriner was attentive and thorough. She was able to adjust my neck with no problem. This is often an area I have a hard time finding someone who can adjust it properly, so I was very happy.  Fair pricing I feel. $35 for adjustments with the new pt exam being an additional $35.

I love this mechanic shop and have gone here forever. Good work. Fair prices. Honest! Everything you want in a mechanic. The shop has been here since I can remember plus some.   There's also a bike shop inside with bikes and bike parts. They also build and repair bikes. They make keys too.

I love their pizza. It's flavorful with a crisp crust. The staff is friendly and service is fast. I also love the hot sandwiches. Prices are decent and they deliver too!

Summary-only go to this place for happy hour drinks and food (HH food is only available mon-fri).   For the drinks and happy hour I'd give a 4 star rating, but our overall experience wasn't so great. We were given a menu and were quite happy with our appetizer choices only to find out those weren't served on Saturdays and the same with the dinner menu. If you are there for lunch on the weekend there is a separate small menu on the last page so don't get excited by anything on the 1st 3 pages because you probably can't order them and they won't tell you this until you try. They really need to have different menus for different days and times. Plus our salad wasn't very good and way over priced. The ceviche was good, but again way over priced if it isn't happy hour.   P.S. They had only 2 umbrellas for the entire patio which covered 1.5 tables leaving the remaining 10ish tables uncovered. Kinda lame for Phoenix

After leaving my bad review Dana was gracious enough to contact me, which to me goes a long way. So I wanted to add this bonus review that I do love Hula's for happy hour. I will go back someday for actual dining and try it again.

Great prices and very nice staff my car always looks nice after I have them clean it for me. I also often just run through with the $3 quick wash and utilize the free vacuums.   The offer a full menu of choices from the very basic to the ultra detailed hand wash.

I really wanted to like this place for dinner it seemed to have such promise but our party left disappointed.   We sat on the patio since it was such a nice night out. Half of the tables were plastic card tables and chairs with table clothes. It was a strange contrast to the other patio furniture and indoor decor. Our service was ok. We had to request a refill of the water bottle twice and the waitress just seem to agree with is but not really know the ins and outs.   As for the food our party had the lemon chicken, braised short ribs, crab cakes and lasagne with sausage. Only the lemon chicken got a somewhat thumbs up. It only had some slightly burnt areas and was a little too lemony. The braised short ribs were moderately burnt not that it mattered because it was so salty there was no taste beyond that. I sent mine home with my friend to give to her husband, maybe he could eat it. The lasagna had potential if the entire top layer wasn't a piece of charcoal. It was nice to discover that under the excess sauce and sausage. Inedible. My friend then asked for the crab cake appetizer. That got an ok as well with only slightly burnt edges. Because we were still hungry we decided to order dessert, chocolate creme brûlée with brandies cherries. It was good I think but over half was made of cherries. I thought they would be on top or on the side, but we're in the dish. The side of bread was delicious, which made us think we should have stuck with pizza.   Doubtful any of us will return since there are so many other options to try.

Delicious! Fresh toppings. Great yogurt flavors. You can try any of them too. I had the cake batter with a brownie bite, strawberries, blackberries ( so good) and small cheesecake bites ( I should have gone with a dollop of the cheesecake yogurt instead). Overall really good. The guy was a little aggressive on his sales according to my friend. The treats really speak for themselves after trying them. I felt the prices were fair for what I got. It's by weight not size.

Love Dutch Bros! This location is my favorite by far, and I've been to quite a few around the valley. Great people working here, fast and friendly.

My review is based off their chorizo and egg burrito, which is what I always get. Its not super greasy and it's delicious.

I love this place for lunch and dinner. Fresh ingredients with its own flavor. The cilantro-lime dressing is super good, I always ask for some on the side to use.   I'm not a big fan if the breakfast burritos which is why I gave it 4 stars but they are passable.

While I'm starting low because my experience hasn't been that great, I'm still willing to come back and try it again.   Walking in the decor is modern hip diner with wood flooring, dark cabinetry, paper fixtures, and an appeasing green/orange/brown color scheme. I didn't have to wait as I went straight to the bar to sit. The noise level is a little loud with techno type music playing. This is a little random but the silverware was bulky and hard to use.   I ordered 1 scrambled egg. Side of hash browns. Soyrizo. Tortilla. Coffee. The total was $11.37. The egg was cooked well and the hash browns was a healthy portion. However, both were very bland. I didn't even eat the soyrizo as the spices gave it a horrible taste, so I didn't touch it past the first bite. I'm spoiled by the Trader Joes soyrizo I think. The coffee was also bland, but I drank it because I needed my caffeine. I was never offered a refill or top off. The bartender was prompt enough but no personality. Never asked how everything was etc.   I've heard so many good things about this place, so I was disappointed. Next time I will try those pancakes everyone talks about, and partake of the bar menu.
