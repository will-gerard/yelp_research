My bird-eating wife got the chilaquiles last time and I stole some of the meatless parts. Amazing and spicy! Next time we're on Van Buren, I'm asking for chilaquiles plus a fried egg, minus the chicken.  Best thing? Try the potato tacos. That's right. Potato. Tacos. Yum.  La Tolteca is fantastic. Every time I go in, I'm tempted to walk out with a (paid-for) molcajete. Instead, I walk out too-full because I wanted to try so many things.

They make a decent pizza with ample toppings and a chewy crust. Better, their sauce is sweet!

A great family-owned and operated neighborhood pizza place, Spinato's has a really sweet sauce on their pies that I cant get enough of. Square cut pizza is always easier to share with the family too. Eat-in or takeout service is always top-notch.

Stopped in tonight, a Sunday, right at closing to get some crickets for our new family gecko. Surprisingly, they invited us in for a $1 sale after closing time. It's service like that that will bring us back and keep us from the big chains!

Nice guys here sold me my family's first pet--a leopard gecko. Seemed like a good deal and they offered to help me out with any questions post-purchase.

Don't waste your time at the trendy yogurt shops. Go old school. Support the little guys.   Any flavor is good, just make sure to ask for bahama rama mama.

For a movie place, the food is pretty good, even for vegetarians! They even mix a decent drink. Now, if I could only remember what I had and liked...   Ironically, it's the popcorn that we're always tempted to order but never end up too fond of.

Anyone can clean clothes. Not everyone gets customer service.   Showed up at 6:05 tonight (they close at 6 on Saturdays) and the door was locked. Normally okay, but my wife needed her clothes for 8 am flight tomorrow. Young lady inside wouldn't even acknowledge me even after we made eye contact. Another woman inside completely ignored my knock on the glass door. Neither picked up the phone (calling from parking lot).  Dry cleaning is a prepaid service, so grqbbing our clothes would have taken all of three minutes. To acknowledge that we needed help, even to reply with, "sorry, but i cant help..." would have made us feel better.  That's bad service. And a reason to go elsewhere.    Never doing business here again -- so much for supporting the little guys.

Unless it's dishonest and uneducated salespeople and sticky counters you're looking for, go someplace else. Their staff is all slimy used car salespeople-in-training.  If someone's helpful, it's because they're getting commission. And take a close look at that slip you take to the register -- they're known for secretly sneaking in additional items or the next-level-up product.  Here's some things I've experienced:   -Man in memory section told me I couldn't grab an OEM box of Windows 7 from the shelf (just a few aisles away) and had to include it on his commission slip --sneaky -Man in home a/v had never heard of Roku Player.  --uninformed/uneducated salespeople -Man in Apple section (where they have the new Apple TV) excused the fact that they're not demoing one with "Yeah, Apple doesn't let us set them up." --tacky

Best house margarita in Phoenix.   Their ingredients are standard, but something makes them tangy and I can't figure it out to duplicate at home. Keeps me coming back I guess.   We'd be back more if they offered better vegetarian selections...

Best House Margarita in town, hands down. Honestly, I've tried to duplicate their tangy concoction a few times--the waitstaff says it's the standard stuff--I'm convinced they let the lime juice go a little bad to make it tangy. Call me crazy. Doesn't matter how they make it though, cause that shit's fantastic and it keeps me coming back.   Can't remember their food too much. I mostly just remember that their vegetarian options are sparse or less-than-exciting.  If you've not been to OTTF, make sure to sit outside; you're wasting your time if you end up inside.  BTW, I've only dumped ice from the margarita tumbler all over the table once. Woohoo!

Love this place! Since becoming vegetarian I've missed chicken wings; Green has a tasty, vegan alternative! For an appetizer, Chili Fries are tasty too!  I've had the No Harm Chicken Parm and the "Meatball Po-Boy; both were pretty good, but the Thai Peanut Bowl is my favorite.

Nice enough to propose at and casual enough to see stray cats, House of Tricks is an old-school Tempe treat. If the weather's nice, you should sit outside. That's what my wife and I did last night, by the fire (TWSS). If you're into sitting at the bar, there's none better (when it's cool) and their wine selection is outstanding.  We shared: Fried Fromage Dauphinoise with Homemade Strawberry Preserves, Arugula and Grilled Ciabatta (intimidating name, right?). Think chewy bread with warm brie and strawberry jam. Yeah. Good.  She had: Vegetarian Fall Harvest Lasagna with Four Cheeses, San Marzano Tomatoes and Sage Béchamel. I just had a couple bites (and the mushroom), but her lasagna was fantastic; not mushy-eggplanty like a lot of veggie lasagnes.  I had: Roasted Baby Beets with Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese, Toasted Almond Pesto and Verjus Vinaigrette. It was fantastic and filling, with a large portion of cheese. Beets are so trendy right now and it'd hard to prepare them poorly, but these were exceptional.   We shared: Flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel something. Tasted exactly like it sounds. Rich and tasty and sweet and salty and good with coffee.

My family's been going here for years. Ask for the spicier chunky salsa! If you eat meat, get the Mini Macho (I think it's been renamed). Otherwise, their Green Corn Tamale is awesome too!

One star for:  Great tasking House Margarita, however expensive ($10.50) and small (maybe 5 oz.). Patio seating on the roof was great for fall.  But: My "Vegetarian Chile Relleno" was stuffed with chicken. Our waitress didn't bring a drink to my kid after he asked for water. Slow service on the roof.  Food is overpriced by about 20%. (I know it's Carefree, but it's silly.)

I'm not gay. I love Amsterdam. See what I did there?  The ambience and staff at Amsterdam are pretentious-less and anxiety-inhibiting. The drinks are well-mixed and appropriately priced. The bar itself is inspiring and the seating, comfortable.

There is no better old school-style Mexican food in the valley. The wait is never as long as your friends have complained that it is and the food is great! Get a pitcher (or two) of sangria and the enchiladas (red) with a fried egg!

Always great. Always hip. Moscow Mule is my favorite drink and my girl likes the Caramel Apple Martini--always served to the brim. Hell's Fire Chips are fantastic too, with extra AZ Gunslinger sauce.

Loving this place since I was a kid. Stopped eating meat three years ago, so I miss the Jerk Fried Rice and Carnitas and Emerald Chicken, BUT the Veggie Quesadilla with black beans and white rice is amazing with their tasty red salsa.  Always amazing customer service and it's great that they let you taste everything before you commit.   They should lighten their footprint and reduce food packaging. I always feel guilty when I leave with all that aluminum and styrofoam.  BTW, don't be swayed by offers of other cookies; snickerdoodles are where it's at.

The ambience is great and just shy of being too hip. Waitstaff was super friendly--felt like I was eating at a friend's house, but guess that's the point.  Limoncello and chocolate desserts were great. Our waitress suggested we get the chocolate one over ice cream. You should try it.  Didn't try the pizza. We'll be back.

I've been here twice for brunch and it's great! My carnivorous son got the steak and eggs and it looked pretty high quality. My girl likes the Chilaquiles and I've enjoyed the vegetarian omelet and I totally vouch for the Huevos Rancheros.  I'm excited to head there for lunch or dinner to try the margaritas and something that's not on the brunch menu.

No better slice of cheese pizza in town. But only go for the cheese--the rest is just pizza.   Eat it right out of the oven with a sprinkle of salt, another of garlic powder and an accompanying Jones soda.

Overrated, trying too hard and wifi too slow to use. Copper Star is like if Lux and Long John Silver's (what's with the front-lit, cartoony menus on the wall?) had a baby.   At least they serve Oregon Chai.

Nice vegetrian section on the menu that reproduces all the options that could come with meat (instead of just implying you could sub tofu).   Good stuff; got take-out tonight of (Vegetarian) Spicy Noodle and had a Thai Iced Tea while I waited. I asked for in-between medium and hot on the former and it came out just right. The Thai Iced Tea was standard issue. 12 bucks for the dinner and drink. Very happy with that I had.

Not sure where to start. Poor service, food and drinks.  My wife and I went there today for lunch. Our waiter made our cocktails because "the bartender sucks." Well, the waiter sucked at making ours too. At a slow time (like 3pm), tables were messy and service was slow.   Their salsa is like spicy, smoky ketchup. I had the spinach enchiladas and they were bland. My wife had the fish tacos and I think the fish was kids' fish sticks.   Blue Agave is that bad. Don't waste your time.

Almost as ghetto as the original, Carolina's (North [as we call it]) offers amazing and cheap Mexican food-the greasy, cheesy kind-and their tortillas are the best in town. Their signature (red) hot sauce is great, but not many people know you can get tasty green hot sauce or tastier pico for a small fee.

As Mayor on @foursquare, I'm obligated to review this place. Favorite is the Veggie Mixto burrito. I add pico and green salsa and salt to the inside though, as I think they're salsas are bland.

It's always nice when the owner of the restaurant asks how you're doing. That's the service you get every time from Jalapeño Inferno in North Scottsdale.  The lighting is better in the bar, so I prefer to sit there. We shared the green corn tamales, always a treat, but I don't think they need the cheese in them.   My wife got some kind of fried mexican pizza that was huge and delicious (most of it is in my fridge this morning). I tried the Goat Cheese and Mushroom Enchiladas and they were super tasty, as were the black beans on the side.  The *Princess Margarita was good, but she said it was little too tart. I had The Boss and the Top Shelf, each unique and tasty, but I'll stick with the Top Shelf Margarita only next time.  Overall, this place is great! I thought I remembered it having fewer vegetarian options, but I was good-to-go. I do, however, wish they added something meatless to the spicy section of the menu. I know how good that inferno sauce is ;)  Turns out the owners opened a new place recently for American food, wine and rock-and-roll, Rhythm and Wine. Looking forward to trying that too.

I really, really want to like this place. It's in an area of town that needs a little of what Bomberos tries to bring. It's not cutting it. They just don't get that it's all about service.   I've been here twice; once for wine and bruschetta and once for breakfast. And, I can't overlook that the food has been stellar both times. But the service, OMG, it's out-of-control. And, it's so bad it's not even snobby, we're-too-good-to-help bad which, now that I think about it, would actually make me respect them *more.   The first night we came to this place, my wife and I ordered a couple glasses of wine. When we asked the waitress about the wine and food, she couldn't answer even the most basic of questions. It's like not only had she not eaten the food, she hadn't even been briefed on how to answer customers' questions intelligently. It was okay though; a fluke, we thought.   Today, my wife and I met a friend for breakfast. The friend was there for five minutes, sitting at a chair waiting, without being offered a glass of water. Because the couches are hard to come by, we moved to an open one right away when it was available and bussed the table ourselves. We sat for probably 10 minutes until someone came by to take the plates and check from the previous couple. After taking our order, we didn't get water, water!, for 10 minutes, let alone our orange juice, mimosas and tea. Remember how their waitstaff doesn't know their product? Yeah, this lady didn't know if they had black tea. "I know we have breakfast tea," she said.  When our food arrived, it was beautifully presented and tasted great, but it seemed to put our waitress out when we asked for butter knives for, well, our butter and napkins, etc.  Halfway through eating, we finally got that OJ and mimosa. Oh, and the waitress came back with a box with a choice of teas for the high-maintenance of us that asked for black tea ;)  So, if you've got some time on your hands to wait around and enjoy the ambience (which is actually quite good with mature mesquite trees and classical guitar music), this is a decent place. If you're looking for service, go someplace else, like Lola's.

This is my new favorite Phoenix restaurant. I'm not good at commitment (don't tell my wife), so I'm the guy who asks waitstaff for recommendations. When I couldn't decide, she offered me two half portions of a salad and some curry thing. Loved both! The lemonade is tasty too!

LOVE IT! Share a church pew with another family and grab an Irish car bomb. Can't remember all the pasties I've had, but I know I like the one with curry and fake chicken! Also try the garlic fries, but make sure your woman has some too so you don't sacrifice any kisses. If you're into beans, get the white beans in the tomato sauce, extra spicy; it's great, but I'm going to ask for it without cheese next time.  If you're not a drinker, the lemonade is tasty too!

This is the best Pita Jungle and it's not just because they have a full bar. The waitstaff seems to care more about your experience much more than the other valley locations.  I recommend the Lentil Fetoosh Salad and the Lavosh Pizza (?--may have the name wrong, but it's not to be confused with the Lavosh Pita, which isn't nearly as good).  Even the cheap House Margaritas are good.

Big fat meh!   No alcohol and (at keast some) soda was served from bottles. Wife liked the ketchupy red salsa; I enjoyed the green. Chips were chewy and greasy, not bad, but different. I had the chiles rellenos -- the green sauce was bland and the chile, very mild. My wife has the chicken enchiladas with the same bland sauce. Kid one had a red tamale that had mushrooms, etc. in it? Wasn't expecting that! Kid two had scrambled eggs.   This place just isn't worth it. There's way better Mexican in town and Spinato's is right across the street.

Took my girl to @localbreeze for her birthday last night (not that it's a celebration-type restaurant, more that it's a quaint downtown spot without a wait and decent outdoor seating). It was our second time there and we had a great time.  They're pretty light on vegetarian faire :(, but I enjoyed the hummus and lavash (minus the bacon). They make a decent margarita too.   Our guests enjoyed the spicy shrimp appetizer. A peach-flavored, creamy cocktail was delivered to our table by the bartender(?) along with an apology (apparently many order it and expect something else), but the drinker said it was great.   The outdoor seating is very casual and southern-feeling; misters were appreciated.

Lola is Lux without the pretentious atmosphere of staff and clientelle. It's gorgeous inside and the barista (looks familiar, is he from Lux?) took pride in his work despite the busy rush on a couple of drinks for my son and me. The peach muffin was fantastic too.   Keep it up, Lola.

Love this little pizza place. Came with my wife on a busy night and had some muddled, old-school drinks in the bar. Pizza and service were both fantastic, but I don't remember the details. Highly recommended and, if you're feeling the muddled, go with the drink with bourbon and cherries.

Odd place, Rochelli's... Stopped in here one night on my way home to a hungry family. Decor is typical low budget, new shop hodge-podge. Got garlic bread, some pasta and a large pizza. Bread and pasta were meh, but the pizza, in it's out-of-roundness was quite good, however small.   We'll be back, but it wont be for their ambience or garlic bread. It'll be for those funky looking pizzas--and to support the little guys.

Yay, a hole-in-the-wall mexican joint that's vegetarian-friendly!   My kid and I loved the (homemade?) horchata, sediment and all--even better that its served punchbowl (punchbucket?)-style.   I had the bean and cheese burrito, served some special style with raw onions and Tapatio sauce inside. Tasty! Because we don't hit that area of town much and I didn't know when we'd be back, I tried the corn as well, with all the fixin's, that is, lime, cheese, cream(?) and Tapatio. Not really my taste, but it was the most elaborate corn-on-the-cob I've seen.   My kid was happy with the bean burrito too, sans the onions and sauce. My wife had a quesadilla with grilled onions. It was a little small, but looked good and she seemed to like it. She loved one of their flavored margaritas, the maroon one with a funny name that starts with a j.  We also all shared the chips, salsa and guac. Not a fan of creamy guac, I stuck with the salsa, which i loved, but my wife, a guacamole connoisseur, really liked it.   We'll be back...
