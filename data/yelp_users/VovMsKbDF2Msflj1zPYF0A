mmm.... I am so happy that I can't make it to Panne Bianco every day.  If I could, I'd be spoiled and unable to eat relatively crappy sandwiches and salads.    Must must try the fresh mozzarella (salad or sandwich form).    Did I say... mmmmmm.........

I used to be a huge huge fan of this place.  But, recently they seem to have quality control issues.  One issue has been the bread---which used to be nothing short of awesome.  One a couple of recent visits (off the lunch time rush) the bread tasted like it had been sitting around (in one case, the sandwich was inedible).  A second issue has been seasoning, which used to be perfect.  In one case, the sandwich lacked any taste and in another case, the moz was unevenly salted.  All of these are "sins" that are excusable from an ordinary sandwich shop with ordinary prices.  (Well, the inedible sandwich isn't excusable...)  But, I expect much better from PB.

One word for my late: Water.  Not really sure what went wrong.  On the other hand, right next to the Gelato Spot, which is worth something...

Oh, how I dislike this store.  What does a girl have to do to get someone to find her a macbook battery?  Seriously.  How many people do I have to ask.  And, then, finally someone goes to look, only to come back saying that they don't have any.  The mac store has no macbook batteries?

I never knew I was an ice cream snob, until this evening.   I had such high hopes for this place.  I love diners.  I love ice cream.  Perfect location (well, almost perfect, for me).  Number one in Phoenix-Yelp Ice Cream.  How can this go wrong?    Well, unfortunately, the ice cream just didn't cut muster.  I mean, I'm sure its not the worst I've ever tasted.  (But, I am struggling to think of worse ice cream.)  There's just something that's off and I can't pinpoint it.    Maybe they were just having a bad night.  Or maybe I ordered incorrectly....

Yes, Julia T's review may be boring.  But, it didn't stop me from heading over to someburros.  Good thing!  She was spot on!    Nothing more I can say above what J said... Take a look at her review!

I am shocked----could it really be the case that service here was once less than friendly?  I've only been going here for about a month, but everyone is super friendly, in the everyone knows your name sort of way.  This place deserves somewhere between 4-5 stars.  I just can't bear to give a coffee shop five stars---the coffee itself must be absolutely perfect for five (which it is not).    My one complaint is that it is slightly too uber-cool for me.  Definitely bring your laptops if you want to fit in.  PS: I find some of the pastries dry.  But, the pies are quite yummy.

I really like this place.  Nice friendly atmosphere.  Drive through.  Oh, and, small point, good coffee.  (Only good---not great, but I'm a coffee snob.)  When their wireless shifts from spotty to stable, I'll be there all the time.   PS: Get there at an insanely early hour, i.e., 6:30am, and you'll have yummy muffins just out of the oven.  mmmm.......

I like this place.  There's nothing particularly outstanding about it.  I'd rate any dimension "fine."  But, somehow, all together, it works.  Homey and relaxed feel to it.

I like this place.  I never know what to get and just end up staring at the counter for like ten minutes. My favorites are the Olive Bread, focaccia (best eaten heated), baggettes, and, yes, the pumpkin bread.    The negatives are obvious.  It is expensive.  Their hours are limited.  And, the bread should REALLY be eaten that day.    Yes, this last point seems obvious.  Shouldn't any bread be eaten that day?  But, sometimes you just wanna cheat and eat the bread the next day.  That doesn't really work for SB.

Really, who finds their locksmith off of Yelp?  Let me tell you---great idea!  Jeff went above and beyond to deal with my lock issue.  (Including, coming back a second time, so that I could gather info before he added a lock.)  And his prices were completely reasonable.   Side note: He didn't know that he had a good yelp review out there and seemed quite touched by it.

So, i've been in this area many many times, just wanting a sandwich and not knowing where to go.  See scratch on Yelp and get excited---finally a place for that sandwich---and a place where i can pull out that laptop.   Well, when my sandwich arrived I just knew it would not be good.  Don't get me wrong---it is presented quite nicely, but it was obvious that the bread was all wrong.  And, indeed, upon taste, the bread was just awful.  I expected much better from a french pastry-type shop.   The pastries looked (in size) like those you'd find in france.  But, if you know french pastries well, you can look at them and again tell it wasn't quite right.  Taste-wise, however, they were fine.  I've had much better---but I'd eat these again.   Its a bit difficult to find.  Its on the north side of the street, in the strip mall with the huge grocery store.

Fresh, crisp, nice flavors.  Very clean and prompt.  My one complaint is that it is small and feels a bit aloof.  (So, i prefer take-out.)  But really good food.

so i'm a chocoholic.  love good chocolate.  well, okay, love bad chocolate too.  have been even known to walk around cities on a chocolate-ice cream-tasting exhibition.  (you know: try ten different chocolate ice creams---to see which is the best...)  but, i go to sweet republic and consistently find myself **not** ordering the chocolate ice cream!  yes, the other flavors are just that good---to make me give up chocolate!  i've even been known to order the basil lime sorbet.  sorbet?  really?  i feel like such an ice cream fake... but, its just that good....   the one disappointment is the cheese ice cream.  it sounds so crazy that, you think, its got to be awesome.  plus, its cheese, and who doesn't like cheese, right?  but, i just can't get into it....   after writing this review, i feel like i've let down my two favorite food groups: chocolate and cheese...

Really 2.5 stars:  For no particular reason, I was walking, and walking, and walking.  Hours.  At some point, I realize that I am exhausted and hungry.  Just there is Hob Nob.  Great!  Exactly what I need---just someplace to crash.  At its entirely cute.  Things were totally stacked in their favor---I really wanted to (and still do!) want to like them!  How in the world can this go wrong?    First, there seemed to be like fifty zillion employees tumbling over each other, so disorganized.  (Seriously---there were, what, two customers in the store.  Not sure what the disorganization was about.)  Second, the coffee.  The second they pulled out the cup they were going to put the coffee in, I just knew there would be a problem.  I mean, coffee really does taste better/worse in particular types of cups.  On top of that, the coffee was rather watery.  Okay, food comes.  On a plate that reminds me of big hair and shoulder pads.  But that's being picky.  And, I taste the salad---really quite awesome!!!!  So, I'm now thinking to myself, just don't think of it as a coffee shop, and its really quite likable.  Until I bite into that crouton.  Burnt.  And another one---burnt again!  ......  Seems like this can be a really great place, with some tiny twists.  They have a great base----great atmosphere and the knowledge to make food.  But, until then....  PS: Owners, please don't write to me asking me to come back, etc and rewrite my review.  I hate when owners do that after you've given a less than stellar review.

I always thought of myself as a calm, laid back gal... But, it turns out that the waitstaff at a certain restaurant can get me **really** riled up.  Some highlights:  Picture a waiter walking up to your table and instead of saying "welcome... what would you like..." just walking up and saying, well,  nothing!  Yes, nothing.  Just staring. Eventually, you get said waiter to talk. Turns out its probably better when he doesn't talk.  Completely unhelpful in helping us understand how many pizzas to get for the group.  Fast forward... pizzas arrive ... only not quite what we ordered.  We say "its no big deal" but clearly in an "I'm being polite" sort of way.  There is a clear reaction that any decent waitstaff would have---"sorry!  we'll fix this."  Instead just utter rudeness throughout the rest of the meal.    The pizzas themselves were fine.  Probably 3.5-4 fine.  But, the waitstaff....   One word of caution: Its rather hard to find.  You might not find it and circle the block two or three times.  Or, you might find it at the last second and want to make a sharp right turn.  Please be nice to the cars behind you!

It happens every season of top chef.  Some perfectly amazing chef forgets to salt his dish (or over/undercooks it, etc..) and we go from an awesome idea to getting booted off the show.   That's how I felt at THBJ.  A breakfast bowl that grossly lacked salt.  Potatoes where half were cooked perfectly and half were undercooked.  And, oh yeah, putting hot oily food in a plastic container so that the oil eats through the plastic and you don't realize that half your food is essentially touching the (not terribly clean) table.  YUCK!!!!   After reading that last line, you might wonder: Why in the world did she give it two whole stars?  What can I say, i'm a sucker for a place called a breakfast joint.  (But, who creates a breakfast joint that doesn't serve breakfast all day?  Really?)

I always struggled to understand this place.  I really like the idea of a wrap---and a veggie friendly wrap is even better.  But, there were some real roadblocks that left me confused.  Tonight, I finally figured out the trick to That's a Wrap.   First my problem: I like wraps for lunch.  But, it seems to me that many (if not all?) the wraps are pretty heavy.  Flavor wise, they were awesome.  But so much food---filled with rice---that they put me to sleep. The wraps would work for dinner.  But, somehow, I am never up for a wrap come dinner time.   The trick: Dump the wrap and get the bowl.  Solves the dinner problem!  (And, yes, the flavors are awesome.)  Now, the whole lunch/heavy wrap issue still remains.  Please please develop light wraps! I'll then be there everyday.   One minor complaint on the bowl: The eggplant was sort of rubbery.

Poblano's makes me happy.    Some highlights:   1. Really good and fresh food.   2. Extremely clean: Both the store and the kitchen.  (Its an open kitchen.)  3. They are open late: Now they are only open to 10.  (An hour later than the average phx place.)  But they say that after their grand opening the store will be open till midnight and the drive-through will be open 24 hours.   4. They are in my hood.  (Yes, you should care that they are in my hood!)  These last two points are really important: It means no more eribertos or pizza hut for me, when I am searching for food at 11pm.  Finally a good food option!   I really hope they make it.  Once they begin their late night hours, I'll be there every night...
