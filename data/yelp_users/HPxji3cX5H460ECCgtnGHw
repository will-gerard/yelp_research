I have been lucky enough to visit some amazing zoos in my life.  That being said, the Phoenix Zoo did not disappoint!  Make sure you wear your walking shoes; the open concept layout lends itself to long, meandering strolls through the exhibits.  The place is huge!  I also found this zoo, more so than any other, to be very child oriented.  There are splash pads, paddle boats, a carousel, petting zoo, a hands-on stingray exhibit....the list goes on.  The animal enclosures, or lack-thereof, are a refreshing change to those seen in many older zoos.  The exhibits are expansive and the animals seem happy and well cared for.  If you have kids, this is an absolute must see in Phoenix. If you don't have kids yet...get busy.  You need a good excuse to hit this spot more often!

I could have eaten at least million million mini crab and lobster burgers, each with a side of the unbelievably delicious spicy calamari...oh, and don't forget the truffle fries.     Those were my favorite items, but the beef tenderloin burgers, mini lobster rolls and red pepper soup weren't far behind.  I was too full to try to dessert, and it sounds like I missed out on something really special.  What I did not miss out on was the drinks.  In fact, I tried one of everything (possibly more than one of a couple).  The red wine was remarkable and the cocktails were out of this world.    I felt like I had just left the Oscar's when I got home and checked out the contents of my swag bag.  Two free lunches...what??  And two free Stoli Dolis to go with those lunches.  Hell yeah!  Don't forget about the golf tees, chocolates, mints and pen.  To top it all off, my favorite thing about elite events, I had the pleasure of meeting new Yelpers and catching up with those I already know.  Robert L. and Shaina T. and Maggie F., you guys rock!    Also...can I just say that the ice sculpture kicked ass!  A huge thanks to Lindsey and Gabi for putting together this amazing event.  Lots of love to Nader for capturing it all on film so we can remember just how good we Elites have it for years and years to come.  And last but certainly not least, hats off the the Capital Grille staff.  They wined us and dined us from the moment we set foot in their house, and treated us as honored guests until the last of us departed.  Thank you!!

When most people think "toy store"  the first thing that comes to mind is Toys 'R Us, or something similar.  If you are like me, and lucky enough to have visited Toy Anxiety, it is surely the new standard for toy stores.  The place is packed full of toys; old, new, pre-loved, collectible, classic...you name it and they have it.  When you enter the stores' jam packed full of toys location, you can't help but be overwhelmed.  After orienting yourself with the layout and "zones" it turns in to a real life treasure hunt.  There is something for everyone here.   One of the things I love most about this place; There are a few plastic chests of drawers full of $1 toys, the perfect distraction for a toddler that would otherwise be tearing apart originally packaged, extremely expensive action figures or "riding" an AT-AT, thus allowing the adults to enjoy Toy Anxiety to the fullest.

I have been here a few times and I will continue to return. Here are the key reasons:  -The staff is friendly and fun -There is a price list posted. (is it weird that this is important to me?) -The shop is super clean -There TVs are usually tuned to the Food Network! -Lastly, the prices are great, but be warned; there is a $1.50 charge to use debit or credit card.  Next time I come, and I will be back, I will be sure to have cash handy.

Pet Food Depot is great!  They only carry high quality feed in this joint.  The staff is knowledgeable and willing to make recommendations.  More often that not, these guys even load the ginormous bags of food in to my car for me! The food and treat selection is amazing and the prices can't be beat.  If you are looking for Kibbles 'n Bits, you won't find it here, but if you want the best for your pet, come check out everything Pet Food Depot has to offer.

I arrived at 8:55a, five minutes before my oil change reservation.  A gentleman at the service counter said he would be right with me and when he finished up he asked how he could help.  I told him I had a reservation for an oil change at 9.  He got all my info and directed me to the waiting room.  I asked how long it would take.  He said that they would be pulling may car into the garage and that it should be done in "no time."  After waiting 45 minutes my vehicle still had not been moved from spot I parked in when I arrived at the shop.  Work had, however, begun on the vehicles belonging to the two gentleman that arrived after me.  I questioned the manager about the situation and assure me it was a mistake and apologized.  Whatever.  Since I knew I would still be there for a while, I cruised around the store to pass the time.  I had a question about some of the car wash/wax products, so I asked an associate for help.  He had no product knowledge and was unable to explain the differences between the products despite the significant price difference.  He realized I was annoyed with his lack of useful information and explained that he had a "crappy car" so he didn't use and of the wash and wax products.  Whatever.  Finally, at 1030a, my vehicle was ready.  They get two starts for completing the service, but that is it.  I will not return to this location.

The staff at Hubbard is wonderful!  They are patient with the kids and know how to deal with moms-that-are-frustrated-because-their-18-month-old-child-turns-into-a-crazed-lunatic-each-time-they-arrive-for-swim-lessons...not that I would know.    Their method of teaching the children is very repetitive.  At first, I disliked the idea doing the same exercises at nearly every lesson, but after a few weeks i noticed that my daughter was really responding to their style of teaching.  Their use of songs in the lesson is clever and helped keep toddlers focused.    I agree with others, in that the early classes are more about survival skills than actual swimming, but after a short time my little one was floating on her back and pulling herself out of the pool unassisted. These skills are priceless and make the slight lack of organization at the school and over crowded lobby completely tolerable.

Fatso's is great!  It is a small pizza joint, and while it isn't fancy or glamorous by any stretch of the imagination, it is the perfect place to grab some wings, pizza and beer.    We live close by and come to Fatso's often.  There are several things that keep us coming back.  The Gus....so simple, yet so delicious.  The perfectly crusty bread loaded with sharp cheddar, lean roast beef and fresh jalapenos is undeniably one of favorite sandwiches of all time (check it out Nader!).  Their honey barbecue wings are awesome.  The sauce is made in-house and it is remarkable.  Think sweet, smokey barbecue with a spicy kick.  The wings are baked, an added bonus for me.  The thin crust pizza is good, but don't go in expecting a New York Style pie.  Add fresh garlic to your pizza of choice and you will never want to eat a garlic-less pizza again!  Fatso's has a surprisingly large selection of beers on tap and a number of bottled craft beers (Stone, Rogue, etc.).    Lastly, treat yourself to a Fat Cookie.  It is100% worth the thousands of crunches you'll need to do to work it off!

So far I have only been to Chompie's for breakfast, but everything I have tried has been great.  The fitness omelet is amazing!  I also thoroughly enjoyed the potato latkes and on a third visit I treated myself to scrambled eggs and bacon with fruit.  I have also managed to snag bites of the eggs benedict, corned beef hash, french toast, chicken and waffles and pancakes.  They have yet to disappoint.  Now I need to come back closer to lunch time so I can finally try their mazah ball soup.  It looks delish!

I could not be more thrilled with our first visit to see Dr. Sotelo at Papago Buttes.  From the initial phone call, until we left the office, I was pleased with every interaction I had we had.     It started with a phone call to see if Dr. Sotelo, who came highly recommended, was accepting new patients.  To my excitement he was.  I wanted to make an appointment for the same week, and they were able to accommodate my request.  Before we hung up the call I was told that I would receive a call before my appointment to get all of my information entered into their system.  I loved this!  Someone from the office took all of our information over the phone so when we arrived at the office, we had no paperwork to fill out!  Three signatures (privacy policy, permission to treat, agreement to pay for services), all on the same sheet of paper, and we were free to enjoy the lobby entertainment until our name was called.    The parking lot was large and not crowded.  The waiting area provided ample seating for adults, a bookshelf filled with children's books, a play table and a few small chairs or little ones.  One of the walls was an activity wall with interactive games for the kids while they waited.    After a few minutes, our name was called and we were led back to a room.  Just outside the room was a large toy box. The nursed encouraged us to grab some entertainment on our way in.  My initial thought was, "I guess that means it will be a while."  Wrong!  The nurse took our measurements right away and said the doctor would be right with us.    Within five minutes Dr. Sotelo entered the room.  He spoke to me like I was his equal and explained what he was doing as he did it.  My daughter appreciated this, as did I.  I had chosen to delay certain vaccines. Dr. Sotelo took the time to hear my reasoning behind the decision.  Instead of pushing me to move forward with them, he answered my questions and let me choose how to proceed. After the doctor left, the nurse returned and administered the injections we had decide to go forward with.  When she was done she led us to Dr. Sotelos office.    Dr. Sotelo met us in his there, offered my daughter a sugar-free sucker (which she devoured in minutes), and we sat and discussed milestones, development, etc.  On the way out, a friendly staff member set up our next two (!) appointments, and we were on our way...well, almost on our way.  My daughter insisted on a few more minutes of play time in the lobby before we headed out.  Yes, that is right, she didn't want to leave.  Never did I feel rushed or forgotten.  My daughter had a blast.  The staff was professional, respectful, friendly and courteous.  What more could you ask for in a pediatrician?

Blue Adobe Grill, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways.   I love you every day of the the week, but especially on Thursdays!  I love the way you greet me with a plate of tricolor chips, And the jar of chipotle salsa to pour into a bowl so I may dip.  I love to hear Ivan sing and strum his guitar away, As I savor every bite of my free caesar salad and creme brulee. (Thursday night special if you order a Blue plate)  I love you as I devour your salmon, rellenos, tacos or tamales, But don't forget those delicious beans, they also make me jolly.  I love that you have great specials everyday of the week, Of delicious New Mexican fare does the menu bespeak.  I also love your kids menu and your exceptional staff. One last tip, don't forget to order sangria by the carafe.

I have so much appreciation for the shopping experience that Nordstrom provides.  I showed up right as they opened on Saturday, in a mad rush.  I, being the procrastinator that I am, needed to find the perfect pair of shoes in a hurry.  I walked in, found Christopher (or was it Michael?) and explained that I had no time to browse.  I gave him some preferences (size, price, style, color, etc.) and he was off in a hurry.  Less than five minutes later he returned with a mound of shoes for me to try.  He brought lots that met all of my parameters, but he also brought a few others that he thought I might like.  I tried every pair he brought out and, much to my surprise, I ended up loving one of the pairs that I would never have chosen for myself.  He rang up my purchase and I was on my way.  I checked my watch and I had only spent 15 minutes in the shoe department!  I had budgeted an hour for my trip so I decided to run upstairs and see if I would hit the jackpot twice in one day.  I ran through the dresses, hurdling racks at record speeds.  A lovely associate, whose name escapes me, saw that I was in a hurry and offered to start a room for me.  I obliged, and continued rummaging racks for THE dress.  When all was said and done, I had nine dresses waiting for me in my dressing room.  I started marathon dressing and was checked up on continually.  I was delivered alternate sizes, honest opinions and good conversation by the associate.  She was awesome!  Together we found just the right dress for the occasion.  I left feeling like I had struck gold.  In the end, Nordstrom kept every last drop of that gold, but was it worth it?  Hell yes!

Raintree Pet Resort was accommodating when we had an situation with another pet hotel and had to get set up to board our large dog at the last minute.  They offer several sizes of rooms, suites and runs, have a nice selection of pet toys and accessories in the lobby shop and we were treated with the utmost respect by everyone.  The front desk staff was polite and answered all of my (millions of) questions without making me feel as though I was a bother.  They were happy to take our calls for updates on our pet while we were away, and they had a few fun photos to commemorate his stay when we picked him up.  All in all we were pleased with the services offered and we will return.

I stopped by Apparel Pro this morning to pick up some new scrubs, and I was pleasantly surprised with the quantity of stock they had on hand (although they were out of tops in the size/color/style I was looking for), and the level of service they provided.    When I entered the store a young lady greeted me and asked what I was looking for.  She walked me to the product and showed me the different options available.  She also asked where I worked and told me that they offered a discount (a great one!) to people who work from my employer.   There is an awesome selection of petite and tall scrub bottoms.  They had every brand of scrubs I know of and any color you could possibly want.  There were fewer prints available than I anticipated, but I can't wear prints anyway, so I didn't mind.  There also is a clearance section and everything is $5!

Oh my dear!  Like Mexico, Jamacia and China did the tango on my tongue.  Being a first timer,  I was guided through the menu by a Chino Bandido expert.  I was intrigued by the unorthodox flavor combinations.  Honestly,  I'm not sure how fried rice, emerald chicken (ginger, green onion,  salt) and cuban beans could work together on a plate, but they do!  And those cookies....so yummy.  I'll be back soon to try something completely different.

I love Eden's Grill Inn.  The food, the owners, the lunch special's....everything!  It is, without a doubt, some of the best Mediterranean food in town.  Their gyros are the real deal. A perfectly prepared pita, lots of seasoned beef and lamb, fresh onion and tomato. A side of creamy goodness and some of the best rice I have laid my lips upon and you've got yourself one mighty fine meal.  The gyros, chicken and beef kebab combination ($33) says it feeds two, but I think it would be more than enough for six NFL players or eight midgets...I mean, little people ( approximately seven average sized humans).  What a smokin' deal!    Trust me when I tell you that you are doing your self a disservice if you don't check out Eden's.  They will not disapoint!

We generally do take out because Yasu is very small and very busy, but if you are able to snag a table before it gets too crowded, check out their $5 happy hour menu.  I have only tried a few of the items, but they were great and you can't beat the price!    The nigiri sushi at Yasu is wonderful.  My absolute favorite is the albacore.  It is to-die-for!  The albacore slices are topped with dried (or fried?) garlic and onion then a light sauce is poured over the top.  You have to try it to understand.  The spicy tuna hand rolls are another winner.  Plenty of fishy goodness, and some rice, bursting out of the nori cone.   If you like Tobiko order the "premium" spicy tuna, but be sure to nix the romaine lettuce.  It overpowers and adulterates the tuna and Tobiko flavors I love so much. The specialty rolls are good, but there aren't many to choose from.  Also, the roll ingredients aren't listed on the sushi order sheet...or anywhere else for that matter.  It is a pain to have to flag down a server to ask what's in a Phoenix or Sun roll.    My major disappointment here is lack of a real sushi bar.  There is a bar, but you can't really see what the chefs are making nor can you call out your order to the chefs.  One of my favorite things about sushi restaurants is drinking and getting chummy with the chefs at the bar.  Not gonna happen here...  All in all, a great place to grab some sushi.

MADE is going to be my new stop for unique gifts and the occasional treat for myself.  The shop if filled to the brim with an eclectic selection of books, cards, jewelry, art, children's toys, pet toys, decorations, clothing and accessories.  If you have a few minutes to browse the wares offered in this adorable shop, you are guaranteed to find a gift for just about anyone!  Don't miss the gallery attached to the back of the shop.  It is small, but has some amazing pieces to ponder.

I've visited Butterfield's on several occasions, and while I am never let down by the food or the service, I always feel a bit rushed.  Yes, I understand that there are people waiting for tables, and the quicker you can get me out of there and the next table in, the more money you will make, but what happened today was a real disappointment.    My daughter and I stopped in for breakfast at 9:15 this morning.  The restaurant was only about 3/4 full so we were seated immediately.  We placed our drink order moments after we were seated, and as soon as our server returned with our drinks we ordered our breakfast.  Our food was served within five minutes.  Everything was prepared exactly as we had requested.    We were still enjoying our meal when the bus person stopped by to clear some dishes.  He attempted to take my (two year old) daughter's plate because she was not actively eating it.  I stopped him and said she was still working on it.  He also asked if he could clear my side order of pancakes.  There was still half of the order of on my plate and we had only been eating for about seven minutes.  I told him I was not finished, and he left our table empty handed.    About seven more minutes passed before he returned.  My daughter had eaten every last drop of her kid's chocolate chip pancakes and strip of bacon so he cleared her plate.  He again tried to clear my pancakes plate, despite the fact that I was holding my fork in my hand.  I told him, once more, that we were still working on them.    Our server came by and offered me another iced tea.  I accepted and asked that she bring the check and a small box for my leftovers.  She returned with the tea, check and take out box moments later.  I told her I needed to take my daughter to the restroom, but that we would be coming back right back to finish up as I handed her my debit card to pay.  When we returned to the table it had been completely cleared.  My daughter's orange juice ($3.29 for a kid's size) which was nearly full was gone, as was the untouched iced tea my server had just brought and my side of pancakes.  The take out box with the remainder of my corned beef hash and eggs was sitting on the edge if the table with my check waiting to be signed.  The table had already been set for the next guests.  Unbelievable...We had only been in the restaurant for 31 minutes (from the time we entered the door until we came back to our cleared table)!  If you removed the obnoxious, overzealous busser from this equation our meal would have been four stars.  It was delicious.  Our server was friendly enough.  She made sure our needs were met and checked on us often.    I will likely return to give Butterfield's another chance, but if I am EVER rushed like I was today, you can rest assured I will not return.  I hope to be able to update this review with a couple extra stars soon!

I'll be honest...I had little faith that the staff at Team Arizona could transform me from a passenger that had never operated a motorcycle (or any other vehicle with a clutch), to a licensed motorcycle operator in a matter of two short days.  I'll be damned, they did it!  I took the Motorcycle Safety Course at the Go AZ location in Scottsdale and could not have been more impressed with instructors (Nick and Kevin), the course or the location.  Five hours in the classroom and ten hours on the range provided me with knowledge and skills to safely operate a motorcycle.  Of course I am not going to head off on a 1000 mile ride this weekend, but I feel confident and ready to hop on a bike and cruise around town to get some more practice in.  If you have ever considered getting your motorcycle endorsement, I highly encourage you to contact Team Arizona.  They will provide you with a solid foundation on which to begin your motorcycling adventure.

I love everything about Elite Nails!  To begin with, the location is perfect for me (super close to home).  From the street/parking lot, it looks like you are waking in to a run-of-the-mill little nail shop, but it is actually open, spacious and modern looking.  Instruments are sterilized and individually packaged between each use and the place is immaculate.  The staff is always friendly and accommodating, and they go above and beyond to make sure you are happy with the results of the services you are receiving.  The prices are right on par with the other shops in the area, but the level of service and quality of products used are far superior.  I have to agree with the others...without a doubt, best pedi I have EVER had!

Urban Outfitters is a pretty cool place to pick up some new threads.  The staff at this particular location is great.  They smiled, made eye contact, offered to help me without being annoying.  The gal in the fitting room was uber friendly and willing to offer an honest opinion on the fit and style of different items.    They offer a wide variety of casual to dressy items for women and men, shoes, accessories and some trinkets and do-dads.  I find that the sizes run a bit larger than many other places.  I like that because if I wear a smaller size, I must have lost weight...just admit it, you like that, too!  The store is organized and easy to navigate.  The clearance section usually has some great stuff and the prices are reasonable to downright great.

I can not speak to the quality or quantity of the organic basket, because I have always gotten the conventional, but I am going to have to disagree with other reviewers saying you can get the same quantity and quality produce at the supermarket for the same price.  I, being the nerdy gal that I am, inventoried my baskets for weeks and compared prices at several different markets. BB beat the supermarket prices EVERY time.  It is true, there are certain items that I get time and time again.  Yes, there is occasionally something in my basket that needs to be used right away.  No, the produce is not all local (hello, we live in the middle of the desert).  Overall, this is a great deal.  A large quantity of produce at a great price.  I would pay double what they are charging for the convenience alone.  Add in the "what am I making for dinner this week" surprise factor and the fun of meeting some new people each week and....we have ourselves a winner here, folks!  TIP: For a good time, come to the Grover's Park pickup location! The volunteers are friendly, the line moves fast and there is always fun to be had.

Super quick update.  Today's basket contained:  1 head iceberg lettuce 9 roma tomatoes 3 yellow onions 3 red peppers 3 bell peppers 2 cucumbers 6 green apples 3 Asian Pears 10 bananas 6 nectarines 1 pineapple ~2 lbs grapes  All for only $16.50 ($15 for basket + 1.50 coop fee)!  Everything looks great, although the tomatoes could be a bit more ripe.  I stand by the fact there there is no place in town to get a deal like this on produce...and if there is, you better tell me about it!

After living out west for ages, I moved to San Antonio.  Home to ZERO In-N-Out Burgers!  It was a long few years, but now I am here in Phoenix, and I have been reunited with my old flame.    We picked up just where we left off.  You would never know we hadn't seen or heard from one another in four years.  I took hold of the hot, fresh, juiciness and went to town.  After a few short minutes, it was over.  I wiped the remaining secret sauce from my face.  All I could think about was when we would do it again.....  It will be soon, I assure you it will.  Here are a few of the reasons why In-N-Out gets a solid for stars from me. -There are no microwaves, heat lamps or freezers -They use additive, preservative and filler free beef -The fries are fresh cut all day long -The shakes are made from real ice cream -This is a private, family owned company, with no plans to go public or franchise -The employees smile and make you feel like your business is appreciated.    It is always packed, so be prepared to wait a few minutes.  If you like crispy fries, be sure to order them well done.  If you don't eat meat, order a grilled cheese (prepared on meat-free cooking surface).  Learn the secret In-N-Out lingo, or just order your burger animal style...

Anyone who knows me, knows I do not like to shop.  Not at the mall, not at the outlet center...but especially not at the grocery store.  I can't stand the screaming kids (I already have one of my own, thank you), the long lines, and shopping cart obstacle course.     But......in general, Fresh & Easy is my kind of grocery store.  It is never busy.  The aisles are wide and free of clutter.  Each week they have different $0.98 produce specials. They have great coupons (5 off 25 regularly). Their pre-prepared items are convenient and tasty when I am in a pinch and need something quick. Last but not least, they regularly serve samples of their own F&E branded foods and beverages.  It serves as the *perfect* keep-princess-quiet-so-that-everyone-can-shop-in-peace pit stop.  At this particular location of Fresh & Easy, the parking lot is clean, well-lit and offers plenty of parking stalls.  The shelves are well stocked and the staff is friendly.  There are enough checkout lanes/stands that I have yet to see a line form.  Oh yeah, don't forget to check out the "Up to 50% Off" seciton. It is always full of goodies!

What a great discovery!  Luu's Chicken Bowl is a current favorite for our family.  We had driven by the location several times without even noticing it was there, but I could not be more happy we stumbled across it.   For those of you who don't like to read a page long review, here are some of the things I love most about Luu's....  Homemade, amazingly delicious sauces Fresh, high quality ingredients Fast, friendly service Great prices and generous servings They have a drive through  These guys know how to pack a to-go sack! ...and last but not least.......the CRAB WONTONS!  Oh, you want to know more?  Well, let me elaborate a bit :)  Upon entering Luu's, I always know I will be greeted by a smiling friendly face and an immaculately clean dining area.  There is a white board near the register listing the daily specials (try the teriyaki chicken and yakisoba) and a small counter housing homemade condiments, plastic utensils and a soda fountain.  After I place my order, I always hear a fresh batch of wontons get dropped in the fryer as they prepare our chicken bowls.  After just a few minutes, my order is on the counter perfectly parceled with everything I could need; extra teriyaki sauce, hot sauce, sweet and sour, and if we get a ginger chicken bowl (another must try item) there is also extra ginger sauce.  There are napkins and utensils included in the bag, as well.  If you decide to go through the drive through, keep in mind that they fry the wontons and egg rolls to order so there will be a few minutes of waiting at the window if you order these items.  The crab wontons are the crabbiest I have had.  Ever. They are delish with a double dip into the sweet and sour and then the hot sauce.  Trust me, it will be the best $2.59 +tax you have spent in a long time   **For a nominal fee you can substitute white meat chicken and/or brown rice, both of which I highly recommend

We made a trip back to Vegas for Thanksgiving.  The weather was so nice, we had no choice but to head out for a few hours on the Harley.  Despite living in Vegas for years, no visit is complete without a cruise down the Strip, so that was how we ended our ride.  I wish I could give the Las Vegas sign a five star rating, but for me this iconic spot isn't the same as it used to be.  It is just too accessible now.  There is always a massive crowd.  Long gone are the days of parking on the side of the road in the middle of the night, running across the six lane mega street to get a photo.  No longer do party buses park illegally in the turn lane and let the crazies jump off the bus for a quick snapshot  to memorialize an awesome night (not that I would know).  Now there is a parking lot....The ease of access has increased sign traffic  immensely.  Useful?  Yes, but the lack of the Frogger-esque challenge of getting to the sign, and that fact that you have to wait in a line to take a picture, have diminished the fun and coolness factors exponentially.

Dr. DiNucci is fantastic!  My husband broke his foot and was referred to the Foot and Ankle Center of Arizona by several people.  We met with a few doctors and decided that Dr. DiNucci was definitely the right man for the job.  I, being the lovely chauffeur, joined my husband at every appointment.   The ladies at the front desk are on the ball.  I love that!  Every time we walked in, even the first time, they knew who we were before we said a word.  There was never longer than a 5 minute wait to get back to to a room.  After the nurse did her thing, Dr. DiNucci would appear in a matter of minutes.  His friendly demeanor and willingness to answer even the craziest questions was refreshing.  He had a great sense of humor, but remained professional.  All around a great doctor to work with.  Surgery and recovery have gone well.  We will return to the Foot and Ankle Center of Arizona for all of our future foot care needs!

We have been in to Snip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah twice over the last few months to get my daughter's hair cut, and we will return.  Prior to finding this spot, I cut her hair myself.   While I feel my cuts turned out equally as well, I will gladly pay $15 to have someone else suffer through the painstaking process of cutting my two year old's hair!    The place a barrel of fun each time we come.  A play kitchen, train table and a big bucket of toys greet you as you enter the quaint location.  There are two chairs shaped like cars that my daughter can't wait to jump into for her cut.  There are also three regular chairs for big kids (or adults).  They have a huge selection of DVDs and will gladly pop in whatever tickles your toddlers fancy.  Last but definitely not least, after each cut they style her hair and she loves it!  The first time she got a ponytail with a small flower and some glitter.  This last time she got an adorable 'do with colorful barrettes and lots of glitter.    Treat you little prince of princess to a fun time and support a local business, all in one shot...no that's a win-win situation!

4.5 stars, but if I have to choose four or five, they deserve the benefit of the doubt.    After a rocking party at Mamie P.'s, and far too little sleep, we decided to hit up Bar + Bistro and put their Hangover Brunch to the test.  Right in the middle of the downtown Las Vegas art district, the brick building housing B + B is bursting with character.  It is the perfect backdrop to serve their delicious, unique and artfully prepared food.    The breakfast selection was limited, but it was rounded out with a great selection of Spanish tapas.  I had the Cangrejo Benedict Mofongo.  It was amazing!  The serving was on the small side, but, oh man, did they pack in the flavor. I tasted he pancakes as well. They were delicious, but the presentation left a bit to be desired.  Three pancakes slapped on a barren plate was not doing it for me, but once I took a bite of the sweet, crispy (yes...crispy!) goodness, I forgave the lack of effort to make the plate look pretty.  If you end up ordering the pancakes, add some bacon to cut the sweetness of the dish and pretty up the plate a bit.    On top of the fact that you are getting to enjoy delicious food, in a fun, hip area of Vegas, you are also treated to an awesome display of artwork by local artists.  Many of the pieces are available for purchase.    If you are in the area on a weekend, you must stop by B + B and indulge in the Hangover Brunch.  While you are at it, support a local artist by taking one of their pieces home to adorn your pad.  Then you will forever have a reminder of the goodness that is Bar + Bistro.

Love this place!  Bonus points 'cause it's in my hood.  What's not to love about a 32 Shea?  Not just anyone can turn a vacant fast food restaurant in a strip mall parking lot into a top notch coffee shop.  But the awesome doesn't end there.  By day, they are a coffee shop that serves delicious food, has a full bar and some of the coolest, most fun baristas in the city.  By night, 32 Shea is the perfect place to grab a glass of wine and some amazing bruschetta, or the dinner of the day with an delicious craft beer or even a lavosh pizza and a mint lemon drop martini (holy yumminess).   The homemade green salsa and bloody mary mix are not to be missed!  **Friend 32 Shea on Facebook or follow them on Twitter to make sure you never miss out on the awesome daily deals they offer.  Another bonus is that you will always know what the dinner of the day is!

This is a lovely baby furniture store tucked away in an unassuming location in a strip mall.  To be honest, if I hadn't looked up the place on line, I would never have noticed it from the street.  The store is immaculate, organized and easy to maneuver.  They offer a wide variety of baby furniture, strollers, car seats and the like.  I walked in and was instantly greeted by a friendly employee. He asked what I was looking for and led me directly to the item.  The service was great, as was the selection.  Now they just need to find a way to get more people in the door.  I will definitely return.

When I think of Asian Island, many things come to mind... Delicious, and I mean everything.  Fresh ingredients that are prepared-to-order.  Great service.  Many menu options.  Forever.  As in, it takes FOREVER to get your food here.  If you are in a pinch and need lunch quickly, call ahead or plan to take your meal to-go.  This kind of deliciousness doesn't happen fast.  Dine in customers (and often customers waiting for takeout orders) are treated to crispy wonton strips and dipping sauce to prevent them from eating one another during the extended wait for food.  But fret not, my friend, for once the goods are placed before you, you can't help but forget the agony you endured waiting for it.  This is top notch fast-casual dining.  Sadly, I have to deduct a star for the slow food service.  If they can get moving in the kitchen and start turning tables over a bit more quickly, they'd have no trouble getting a five star rating out of me.

Growing up, when we wanted to have a special family dinner out, we went to a local Chinese buffet. Although my memories of the place are through the eyes of a child, I know it was a real gem.  Fast forward twenty something years and you find me still searching for the elusive, but oh-so-desirable, "perfect" Chinese buffet.  Let me tell you, E-Z buffet was not that place.  The service was good, but beyond that they had little going for them. The food was either too bland or too salty and it all tasted overly processed.  There was not a single dish that I enjoyed.  The corner of the restaurant I was seated in felt dark and cave like. It is highly unlikely I will return, but if I do, I will be sure to update you on my findings.  Now, I must venture on, in search of the ultimate Chinese buffet.

If I were judging visual appeal and ambiance I'd be hard pressed to award Taste  of Greek even a single star.  Thankfully I'm not, and the delicious food and speedy service here earn a solid four stars.  The ingredients are fresh and the food is served hot.  The fries are always perfectly crispy without being burnt.  The gyro meat is a bit greasy, but it is freaking delicious!  The servings sizes are generous, and the gyro special is a killer deal.    Don't judge a book by it's cover.  Give Taste of Greek a chance to earn your business; you'll be glad you did!

**I originally wrote this review on 11/30/11 but it was removed because I included personal information about the instructor (her first and last name).  I am reposting it sans any personal information or other questionable content.**  I called Heart Savers to schedule a BLS for healthcare providers course and spoke to a polite female on the phone. She confirmed there was space available on the date I requested to attend the course, and took my information.   Fast forward a couple of days...As luck would have it, there was a terrible accident on the 202 on my way to the class. Ten minutes before class was scheduled to start I phoned Heart Savers to inform them that I would be a few minutes late, but there was no answer. I called sever time over the next 10 minutes to no avail.   I pulled into a parking spot in front of Heart Savers at 6:09 PM. I entered the location, and there was a woman sitting at one of the desks in the front room. She looked down her nose at me without so much as a greeting. I informed her that I was there for the CPR class. She said that the video had just started and that I could not enter the classroom. I explained that there was a serious accident (as it turns out it was a deadly roll-over) on the highway that had caused the delay. Stared at me as if I was speaking a different language. I then read the telephone number I had been calling aloud to verify that I had been dialing the right number. She confirmed the number was correct, but said she didn't answer the phone because she was teaching the class. The problem with this was that I had called several times between 5:50 and 6:00 PM, before class was scheduled to begin. She maintained that she was teaching and could not answer the phones. I went on to explain that I had a job interview the following day and that I needed to have my new CPR card in order to be considered for the position. She shrugged her shoulders and stared. Frustrated with the situation I headed to the door and muttering under my breath. I asked the woman for her name and exited the building in shambles.   Once outside, I called the location again. Despite the fact that she was sitting in the front room where the phone was ringing, she did not answer. She just looked at the phone and then continued to do whatever it was that she was doing. I was furious! I sat in my car fuming trying to figure out what to do.  I decided that I needed to get the heck out of there, and make sure the world knows that Heart Savers treats paying customers like imbeciles? Yes! That was the perfect solution.   So here I sit, writing to say that if you value small things, like good customer service, and being treated with respect, you may want to take your business elsewhere. If this instructor is any indication of what the rest of the Heart Savers staff is like you can expect to be treated as if you are a lesser life form.  I understand that rules are rules. If the policy is that no one may enter the class once the video starts, so be it. But is it really that that hard to greet a customer when they enter your establishment? And, God forbid, treating that customer with a little respect, compassion and understanding. A simple, "I am sorry but..." would have gone a long, long way in this situation.  I assure you that Heart Savers will never receive a cent from me. Ever.

After a terrible experience with another local company that provides CPR classes, a co-worker recommended that I contact "her guy," Larry, at BLS Services.  I called him midday today and asked if I could attend his class tonight.  Despite the fact that the class was only a few hours later, he invited me to join and confirmed the location and time of the class.    Larry offers the classes out of his home.  He has the front room (formal living/dining area) converted into a classroom, and it works perfectly.  There are a couple of sofas and and several chairs lining the perimeter of the room, leaving plenty of floor space open for the hands-on portion of the course.  Music  played while we filled out our paper work and got situated.  There's even a table with ice cold bottles of water and a bowl of chocolates (awesome!) for student to enjoy during the class.    There are enough mannequins for each of the students to have their own (unlike MANY other classes I have attended) allowing the class to move along quickly.  Larry is patient and adept working with students of all skill levels and backgrounds.  Larry offers private lessons and classes for groups.  He has been teaching CPR classes for over 20 years, and it shows.    The class was concise but extremely informative.  The classroom was comfortable and welcoming.  The instructor was fun, experienced and kept the class moving.  I would highly recommend BLS Services to anyone in need of a CPR or First Aid course!  I will definitely be back in two years when it is time to renew!

We stopped by Fate Brewing for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner and weren't surprised to find it quite busy.  We put our names on the list to wait for a table.  While we waited, we enjoyed a beer on the patio.  Unfortunately, there was little space between the outdoor seating and the high top counter surrounding the patio.  We had enough room to stand and drink our beers but felt that we were intruding on other patrons dining experience.  I'd love to see a little reorganization on the patio to make the counter area more usable, perhaps even some bar stools.    We were seated, brought menus and a cute little jug of water for the table.  We looked over the menu and decided on the house salad, Rustica pizza and a Capicola pizza.  We also enjoyed a flight of the four Fate brews available.    All in all the food was great.  The salad was fresh, the pizzas were unique, delicious and cooked to perfection.  We thoroughly enjoyed the beers.  I loved the Pale Ale and my husband would have sipped on Smoked Porter all night long.  Next to the host stand, there is a cooler housing some of the best cake pops I have ever eaten.  They were more like cookie dough pops than cake pops, if you ask me, but they were amazing!  Snickerdoodle was killer!  There were a few issues with the attentiveness of the servers when it was busy, and our servers menu knowledge was iffy.  Serious five star potential, for the next visit, but until they work out a few minor kinks, I'm sticking with a solid four star rating.
