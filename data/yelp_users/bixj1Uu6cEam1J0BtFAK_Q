I went here on a first date the other day. I've already been here before, but I just got the standard Pad Thai. I know that's just an American thing, so I wanted to try something a bit more Thai. I ordered the Beef Panang, and it was AMAZING. I wanted to eat the whole darn thing, but my stomach wouldn't allow me. That made me so sad, so I'll just have to go back and get some more.  The service was great. We ordered our first drinks from the menu, but our server said he'd just made some fancy shmancy new cocktails the night before, so we just ordered from him and had him give us whatever he'd like. And it was great. The server was super helpful and personable, but he also gave us enough space to chit chat and be on our own.  All in all, a great vibe, great service, great food, and great drinks. I'm going to make this a regular spot for me.

Do not go to this venue. I'm telling you. I repeat...do not go to this venue.  I've been here periodically. I like music. I like shows. I like seeing the bands I enjoy listening to at home.  What I don't like is grumpy girls elbowing me and security guards asking me to leave the audience to discuss the situation.  Yes, I was asked to leave the audience to discuss my apparently hostile situation. What was my hostile situation? Well...trying to move to the front of the audience. Is this some sort of new situation? I don't think so. And this girl was mean. And I'm telling you, mean. I even tried to ask her to just scootch aside so we could both be up front, but apparently she had a Marquee Posse.   All I can say is screw you Marquee. I know I'm not a regular. I know I don't attend regularly. But I also am not a jerk. I simply wanted to watch Chromeo. I love Chromeo. I saw them a couple years ago in California and was looking forward to seeing them in Arizona, but apparently Arizona has favoritism. Screw that and screw you, Marquee. I will personally write Chromeo a grievance letter. I don't expect that I'll get any resolution, but screw your behavior. For as long as I will live in Arizona, which has been the entirety of my life and now forward, I will speak disdain. Screw you.

There's really nothing bad to say about Tammie Coe. The staff is very nice and everything I eat and drink from there is amazing. I often go there for a mocha latte and a muffin. That's just how I roll. But I just got a bundt cake for my mom for Mother's Day, and it was delicious. It was chocolatey goodness and everyone loved it.  The prices can be a little rough and deter me from buying some of their food items, but when it comes to coffee shops, prices are generally typical with regard to coffees and pastries. The thing with Tammie Coe, though, is that I always like what I get. And they're great at making suggestions if you're clueless and indecisive like me.   And here's a plus...they're open on Sundays, now!!! Such good news.

Bartenders are assholes. The short, blonde one in particular thinks he is the the most amazing person in the world because he controls your booze, but screw that rude jerk. I still tip, but they didn't deserve it. Bad service. Rude attitude. I didn't do anything to warrant anything. The cook started taking my order, and the guy got mad at me. My friend was waiting forever for an order that was already poured and I get "you know it takes longer to serve" these orders. No shit. I know what a stout is. It doesn't take 5+ minutes. My lord. ..from start to finish....incompetence.

My friend wanted to come here, because it's cheap and has a variety of options on the conveyer belt. Cheap, it is. Variety, well, maybe not so much.   My issue with these types of sushi places is that the sushi seems to get old on the conveyer belt. It's lukewarm and just not great. Luckily for the price, it ends up being okay. If it were more expensive, I'd be very upset with the quality. All in all, it's okay, but I've had better.   Also, the employees hover over you. It's really weird. And when the lady was determining how much we owed, she was leaning over us and rearranging the plates and making a mess. So, we're left watching her and waiting and not paying attention to each other. It was just weird. Another lady hovered when she wanted to grab something in front of us. Just odd behavior and not very restaurant-like.  Will I jump at the chance to come to this place again? Not at all. There are worse options, though, I suppose.

I've been to this bar before and was neither impressed nor turned off. It did it's job, and I was fine with that.  I ventured back today with a friend for some breakfast and drinks. I was very excited about this breakfast concept, as I was not aware that they served breakfast. Well, we missed breakfast (our fault!) and decided to stay and get some lunch. I got a turkey wrap with coleslaw and it was delicious (which is always a huge relief with regard to bar food in general, for me). The beers were perfectly fine, as always. You can't really go wrong there.  What makes this place a go-to for me is the relaxed, yet helpful service. They're not going to hover over you, yet they come around enough to get you what you need when you need it. And actually before you need it. They seem to work as a team, too, because I'm fairly positive we had at least 3 people serving us. Normally this would be annoying to me, but they were all so helpful and friendly that it just helped to add to the good company I was there with. I haven't been a regular patron of this bar, but I'm thinking it's about time to step it up a notch.

This place is great for Happy Hour. Otherwise, the prices are ridiculous. My friend and I arrived 10 minutes after Happy Hour ended and decide to forget that idea and go somewhere else.  What I can say for the place even during non-Happy Hour times is that they have delicious (and STRONG) drinks. Also, the food is adequate. Certainly not terrible, but not enough to pay more than 10 bucks for a roll. Nope. Sorry.

It's a trainer's world, and you're just living in it. The people here, with the exception of what're beginning to feel like very fake receptionists, are completely rude. It's their space, and they want you to know it. Some girl even fell when she stepped onto a treadmill that was poorly blocked off and going FULL SPEED. And then SHE was more apologetic than the trainer. It's their responsibility to keep people safe, and they FAILED.  Not only that, but good lord, I'm sorry I don't walk as fast as you. Do you REALLY need to creep up behind me and be so obviously waiting for me to move? So sorry to be in your precious little way, trainer. Because I'm obviously always in some trainer's way, whether I'm on a bike, trying to use a treadmill, walking up the stairs or just walking through the dang door. They're like the cool kids in school that just need to feel honored. Please, you're just a trainer and it's a business, get over yourself! In fact, if you want to make more money, be a little nice. Maybe I'd actually buy some trainings. And after talking to some people, I found out that I'm not the only one. But certainly not with this obvious pretension in this wanna-be high school situation. I bet they have cliques amongst their staff.  Beyond the awful staff, machines are always breaking. Unlike LA Fitness, they didn't even give me a complimentary training to show me how to use the machines. If you're there close to their closing time, they start pushing you to leave well before their closing time (music is turned off about 10 minutes prior to closing). Also, don't sit near a cleaning person, because you just might get sprayed!! There's so much more to say about this gym, it's tough to get it all in one comment.  The only reasons I continue to go are location and hours.

This place is pretty much one of my go-to brunch spots and why I can justify 4 stars. You can't beat their mimosa specials, and they've got a great brunch menu.  Many items on their menu are great, but I'm often not blown away by it and I'm often left staring at the menu hoping something will spark my interest a bit more than, "meh, that looks okay." I used to love their macaroni, but the last time I had it, it was soupy. I thought I remembered it being creamy and wonderful...  I know when they opened up they were not trying to be another gay bar, but ultimately this is what reBAR is. It would be awesome to have eye candy of the hetero persuasion, but I guess the cute gay boys will have to do. Maybe down the road the crowd will even out, but I doubt it.   All in all, it's great for weekend brunch, good for some specials during weekdays, and okay when it comes to consistency of their drinks and food.

I am a huge fan of Urban Outfitters clothing in general. They sometimes have questionable business practices and can be quite culturally insensitive, but purely based on clothing, I love them.  With regard to this location, I felt compelled to write about their great customer service. Every time I have gone in here, I have felt very welcomed and supported in my purchases and returns. And I am not an easy customer. I shop online a lot and am always returning/exchanging items. But they are always so helpful and nice, I just love them. This is very unlike the Scottsdale Urban Outfitters experience where it seems like they want nothing to do with you and are too cool for school. This location, though, 5 stars for service. Thanks, guys!!

Let me be clear on one thing: I love this place. The DJ's they have make it a lot of fun and the movie selections are great. In addition, their beer and wine selections are quite tasty.   So, why not 5 stars? I think that the crowd just has to pick up, really. I know they're currently working on adding new menu items and movie selections to the place, but right now, it can just be dead. I went in there most recently last Friday. There was literally only one other group of people there. And I use the term "group of people" loosely, considering it was a group of two. We ended up leaving, because I can spend time with just my group of friends at my house if I wanted to and we were looking more to have an outing. However, I wanted the FilmBar atmosphere and experience that I certainly get on Saturday nights and it just was not there on Friday.   DO go on Saturday nights. DJentrification is great and the vibe is wonderful. BUT...more importantly...go on other days!!! This place needs to fill up. Go see a movie, the theater is great! Get some drinks for happy hour. Go on Friday night and Sunday night! It's a nice bar that really has more of a hip lounge kind of feel.   And the great part is that they're improving every day. I think they're only about a year old and it sometimes takes time. But the staff is great, the drinks are perfectly chosen, and the music is generally pretty amazing.

As far as I can recall, I liked going to this restaurant. I've only been about 3 or 4 times, but when I was in the area and hungry for lunch, this place definitely came to mind.  However, moving forward after my most recent experience, today, I will not be coming back.  To be sure, I was HANGRY, so I was already in need of food and good service. The food did it's job, but the service was lacking.  The service is really necessary at a place like this, too, because the Pho is NOT the best in town. It's adequate, and like I said, it does it's job when you're hungry, but it is NOT the best.  Unfortunately, the service didn't make up for it. I did a lot of soul searching in the 20 minutes it took to get my water, the time it took for me to provide my own place setting, the time it took to wait and wait and wait for condiments (after requesting) before asking a neighboring table for theirs (they were finished, I think), and the time it took to get our check (by this time, the place was empty). Oh, and of course the time it took to wait for the appetizer our server clearly forgot to place an order for until after our meals were served. I think she mentioned the woman making it was backed up (great excuse)...before asking us what we ordered, again. Shady. So, what did my soul searching get me? Yes, I was definitely HANGRY and possibly easily ticked off, but it was just relentlessly bad service. I started wondering if our server knew me and hated me, for some reason. And of course I don't want to say anything about the service while there, because we all know what can happen there (cough cough, spit spit).  What a disappointment. My recommendation is to find another Vietnamese place in town or just go somewhere else, in general. I used to think this place was neat, cute, and just a nice place to go...but oh my gosh...when your entire conversation during lunch is how bad the service is, please...go somewhere else.   To be fair, the girl bussing tables seemed to be on top of things, but almost too on top of things. Is it kosher to interrupt people to clean their table? This fad needs to change. I don't mind messiness on my table. I mind having your arm in my face while I'm talking, though. That I mind.

My friend and I came here for brunch. It was delicious. We opted for the mimosas instead of beers with the $10 brunch specials. The food was amazing. The breakfast burrito was delicious. Made me fall in love with pork all over again. And the breakfast flatbread was also really good. The crust was amazing. I probably could have just had the crust and been happy as can be.  We sat on the patio, even though it is super hot outside. It didn't even matter, because it didn't feel bad at all. With the misters and the swamp cooler, it was pretty comfortable. I like the feel of their patio, and it's obviously dog friendly. My friend and I are going to return with my dog in tow.

I love the concept. It is wonderful, especially with the loss of the Phoenix Public Market, recently. And while I'd love to give it 5 stars because I want them to do well, I have to give it what is realistic to me, right now. Quite frankly, the prices are just too high to help this place last. I could be wrong, but that's just my feeling. I can't ever see myself spending $7 on a tiny thing of ice-cream (especially when this is considered the larger size). Sure, the convenience of guitar strings and smokes work for local musicians and hardcore smokers who need a fix, but I don't exactly fall into either category. I fall into the category of local resident who needs salt, groceries and/or toilet paper, at times. I'm still just more likely to go somewhere else, at this point. At least until the price situation gets sorted out.

My roommate and I stopped by here  on a Saturday night with my groupon to see how this Fuego is holding up. I've been to Fuego Bistro before, and it was amazing, so this one at CityScape had a lot to live up to.  I'd say this place gets less than 5 stars based on atmosphere. The place kind of feels like a cafeteria and the vibe from the entire patron situation is just bleh. The best part about the atmosphere was my own company and that of our server, Brandon, who was really helpful and chatty.  Also, while my roommate got the Chile Relleno, which was okay in my opinion, I had the Fuego Tacos with pernil (which apparently is pork), and they were delicious. I absolutely loved and devoured them.   Some other key points: The drinks were very tasty and parking is very easy. We parked at a meter (which is free after 5p), and I'm told they can validate the parking ticket for the underground parking.  Overall, I'd come back here. I wouldn't go here for a sexy date or if looking for something fancy, but definitely for a tasty dinner with great service.

I'm going to preface this by saying that my friends really loved this place. They defended it over and over again as I complained like a b*tchy baby until I got my way to first move our seat to the outside area and then to another location.  What I did enjoy was the outside area and that there are many good options of beer.  What I absolutely hated was the inside. It is bright. It is ridiculously loud with absolutely every patron's conversation smushed into one loud, mush of a noise. It just has a cold, harsh feeling to it. I felt like I was in a cafeteria. Or Ikea.   Ultimately, I think I'll return with friends from time to time, but only if we sit outside. Luckily, the weather is going to be great very soon, so that shouldn't be a problem.
