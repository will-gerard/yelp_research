Great service! Mike is a great bartender and Joey is top notch! Reverse happy hour is unbeatable with half off drinks and good!

THIS STORE IS GREAT! They truly have all your basic hardware needs, free popcorn upon arrival if you're hungry! And the customers service is fast, helpful and effective. The paint department was able to do a custom batch so that my house could all match and didn't charge us extra! Thanks again, I'll be returning when I need anything hardware related!

This place is Hit or Miss, every time I have come here I have asked to rush the food because they are always so slow! I've only have had one fast experience when it was completely empty. Their food is very average unless you want to spend $15 for a quality roll that doesn't fill you up at all. The only thing positive would be the reverse happy hour from 10-close. If you are looking for quality sushi at a decent price I would travel somewhere else.  Also make sure you make a reservation ahead of time because they tend to take 10 minutes to "set up a table" for you in the back when it's not even busy!

Only 1 man can touch my hair, Roman! He is simply the best. In today's world you want speed and quality, he does both. Great cuts in no time at all. Also the man knows how to style hair with his specialized line on the side that is hands down the best

Great family owned restaurant, food was amazing, but service was a little slow. It's the only place I go to get an authentic Mediterranean food! If you're not on a time crunch and want quality food, then stop by here! I personally enjoyed the Chicken Shawarma Plate, it can with the ability to get two sides. I decided on rice and tabouli and to top it I got 1 baklava and it was amazing!

This place can be described in 1 word "trash" their were cockroaches all over the place and the food was cold as if they tried to reheat it with a microwave! The server was yelling at customers and was very rude! I won't be returning here.

My experience here was absolutely terrible, I came in with a coupon for a free regular sub with purchase of drink and they declined my coupon when it was acceptable at all locations. The worker refused to let me speak to the manager and said I had to pay or leave! Never returning here again. No respect for the customer

Wow just had a burrito bowl! What a delicious meal but a little pricey to add guac for $1.50! Still not a bad deal, would come back and maybe not get guac this time

Stopped by for lunch today, I was immediately greeted by bartender Mike Babin who recommended I try their "SuperMacho Bowl". It was a great choice, very healthy and tasted great! I also then tried the House Margarita which went very well with the meal he recommended I try. Overall I would definitely come back again to this place! Thanks for the great service Mike!

Absolutely love this place! When I come here in person not only is it fast service but it's quality food! Also when ordering over the phone or mobile app I get my food "freaky fast"! Defiantly continuing to eat here!

I usually come here for the breakfast buzz shake and the California club. The service and food is great, I just wish the drive thru would go faster!

The server came and said she would be back in 1 minute, 10 minutes later we told her we were ready and we still never got served. After 20 minutes went got up and  left, never coming back here again if they treat their customers like that

Wow what a great place to grab a bucket for only $5 our bartender Josh made fantastic drinks! Must come back! Our server Kelly really was such a nice down to earth girl that helped me in choosing the amazing Mac and cheese burrito!

Wow! First time here and I was very impressed. Normally when I think of a "country bar" I think of very dirty dive bars with decent food but this place blew me away! They add a night life aspect to this upbeat country bar that really makes it stand out!   Also to add to their amazing concept, I tried the food and it was TO DIE FOR!!! Their Country Fries were gone in 1 minute because my group enjoyed them so much. Also our server Kassie was amazing and helpful with choosing one of their IPA Beers on tap!  I will be returning here again!

WOW! This place is packed on a Monday! Make sure to get here early or make a reservation, but you cannot beat their $20 plate of bruschetta and bottle of wine! Nick was a fantastic server! I will definitely be returning because of his amazing service!

This place is somewhat hidden so make sure you're looking for it but the food is delicious, it may take a while to make but if you have the time it's worth the wait. thinking about returning here again

I've been here at night and during the day. Their Friday night party with DJ Thomas James really knows how to throw a party with music to fit any crowd. I found the food to be a little salty and greasy but the home beer Red, White and Boom was a great choice. The place has a great layout and fun games in the back!

If I could do 0 stars I would, this place has terrible customer service! The room wasn't made and I was charged for a movie I accidentally pressed buy on and canceled and told them I wasn't watching it on the phone right after! I waited for over 1 hours for my food and never received it at the restaurant
