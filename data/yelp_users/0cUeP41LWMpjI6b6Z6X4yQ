I have never had worse service in my life!!! From the lady at the front counter to waiting for 15 min at the snack bar, only to be greeted by someone who did not say a word to me and acted like I was bothering her. I told the manager he said he would give me some coupons.. Never did. It's crazy I've been here before and it was always fine this time seriously the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!

This place ugh. Allow you to book appt online and typically that is great but I've been sitting here for an hour past the time they told me to come in and still have not been seen. Very frustrating to hear nurses talking about their meals when there are people waiting. Grrr

I love love this place! It's not too often you can find really spicy green chile here and it's delicious! The red chile is also fantastic, lately I've been getting the red chile burrito smothered with the hot green chili! Yum! Oh and I love the white salsa also. This place rocks!

This place was a blast. We played bingo and the drinks were poured well and the service was great! Had a blast and will be back. It's a dive so if you don't like dives don't come here. I love dive bars:-)

This place is yum and a many steps up from filiberteos.  There carne asada fries, nachos, and rolled tacos are delicious.   Plus they are open 24 hours so it's perfect.

This place is going downhill fast. Always out of something you want to order. The food is great after you actually get it. It's such a shame I used to love this place. Took almost an hour to get yogurt and salad and ALL the waitstaff and managers look miserable. I guess it would be tough telling people you are out of something 50 times a day:/

This place has the best bagels I've ever had! The everything bagel with jalepeno cream cheese and ham toasted is amazing. Also they sometimes have a jalepeno cheddar bagel that will knock your socks off. The BEST in the valley.

This is a very nice movie theater. It has comfy seats and it's not too packed. It's a little more pricey than other theaters but I'd pay for the atmosphere.

So all I have to say is get the creme brûlée! I will often go somewhere else for dinner and finish here with a glass of wine and the creme brûlée. It's made in house and so yummy get it!

This is a gourmet pizza place so Completely different than most. They don't have some traditional toppings and no ranch. You don't need it though, it's delicious wood fired pizza. They use good meats which is why its a bit pricier. Their pesto pizza is really good too!

This place has really good gyros. The main reason I give this place three stars is because it's the only gyro place that does not have sriracha sauce, which is a must for gyros. The owners are nice too and they give the kids chocolate too:)

This place has the best chilaquiles I've had in a long long time. Best with fried eggs on top. The service was a little slow but good and I also like that they make michaladas. I've tried a couple other things on the menu but the chilaquiles are the best.

This place is awesome! I had the Italian on wheat, my husband had the chicken bacon avocado and my daughter had the meatball. everything I tasted was delicious. The bread was soft and the meat was amazing! The meatball was covered in cheese and oregano and parmesan.    This place had super fresh ingredients. I will definitely return!

After reading the reviews I was so excited to try this place. We ordered the basil chicken, the mango chicken, the orange chicken and teriyaki chicken. We were not impressed with any of it. The chicken tasted watered down with no flavor. The orange and teriyaki were ok nothing amazing though. After spending 42 dollars for an ok meal. I'm not returning here anytime soon.

I've been a regular client for years now. Alycia the owner and my stylist is the absolute best! She has lots of experience and always has the latest fashion accessories. Bling strands are awesome. The salon has a boutique feel and the others girls that work in the salon are fun too! They are always running specials check this place out!

This place is yummy! I had the everything bagel with jalepeno  cream cheese. It was delicious and the owner is really cool too. The only reason I gave this place 4 out of 5 stars is because it's my second favorite bagel shop in the valley. Definitely the best on that side of town. My favorite is all the way east kokobelli :)

This place says it's open till 9pm, the waitress started by telling us all the things that were unavailable on the menu. We got here at 7:45 and ordered bruschetta to start,the waitress said the kitchen was closing so she would "see if they could make it", she said yes, but they would have to cut everything up from scratch. Um okay. They started putting up the chairs around us, it's now 8:20 mind you they close at 9, another couple came in and were told the kitchen was closed that the only thing they could have was pizza. Bad business, making your customers walk out and rushing the ones that were there.

Today was my 1st time eating here. After reading all the 5 star reviews we decided to try this place instead of going to fuddruckers. I'm sad we did. My husband and I both had burgers and were completely unimpressed. They were bland and we both had jalepenos on ours. The bread tasted stale. The fries were pretty good but the apple fries every was raving about. Meh. I left full but definitely not satisfied. I will choose fuddruckers next time for sure. No desire to return here. Oh and everyone also said the owner was really nice, not today. Who knows maybe he was having a bad day.

I was NOT a fan of this place. At 1st I thought hey cool place but quickly changed my mind. The bowling sucks because you have to pay for the hour and then you get kicked off your lane. The drinks were terrible I guess the waitress said something was wrong with the lines. Nope nope not coming back here. Waste of money.

They have the old pretzels that Cadillac ranch used to have! They are so good with that cream cheese fondue. Actually everything I've had here is great. The service rocks too! Glad I'm close to this place. The owner is super cool too. Go here.
