I've been coming to Dr. Zittel for many many years (as has my family) and you will not find a more gentle, kind, competent dentist in AZ. Appointments run on schedule, and the entire staff is friendly and are pros at what they do. Love everything about this practice!

We have been taking our kids here since our first was born in 2009. We absolutely love Dr. Salek. He's patient, doesn't rush you, and genuinely cares about your kids. Definitely qualities everyone should look for in a pediatrician! The only tiny complaints I have is that 1) The exam rooms could be a bit more kid friendly with the decorations, etc. and 2) Certain nurses are not the happiest people to deal with but that's it! We love both locations.

A new date night spot! Me and my husband were looking for a good Italian restaurant besides Olive Garden and we were VERY happy we found Floridino's. We ordered the breadsticks with cheese and they were some of the best I've ever had. For our entree's we both ordered calzones and like a previous reviewer, we too thought they were "understuffed" but still very good.   The prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly. We'll definitely try them again and hope our calzone's are a little more stuffed next time!

My husband surprised me with a beautiful wedding set from Shane when we got engaged. I guess I'm in the minority since I am the only girl in my circle of friends who DIDN'T choose her engagement ring, but my husband did a a great job finding something I still love today, with a little help from a sales associate ;)   The thing I love most about this company is their friendliness and amazing free warranty plan. I can take my ring in whenever I want to get in inspected, cleaned, re-dipped, etc. It's a wonderful perk and definitely gives me peace of mind when it comes to the most important piece of jewelry I'll wear the rest of my life. I now own several pieces of jewelery from them and everything is beautiful.

Love this place! No other wings come close (at least for boneless in my opinion) to what is offered here. And trust me, get the cheese curds. You won't be disappointed. Service is usually good and it's a great place for kids as well. Good choices on the menu for them and ours love that they each get a tablet to play games on. Take-out is hit or miss...sometimes the food isn't very warm and pick up times are often inaccurate.

This location does well with kids and they are quick doing the cut. Wait times can get long but just aim to go during off hours and it shouldn't be a problem.

I hate having to give them 2 stars but the quality of service has changed drastically in the last year or so and I've been going to them since I was in High School! I'm not sure what's happened but the technicians seem to be not very experienced and do sloppy work. The last 2 times I have been in for a pedi, I have had to have them completely re-do the polish. I really do love the atmosphere and the cleanliness but I hope they improve their quality soon!!

Don't believe anyone who rates this establishment under a 4 star review. My husband and I have been going here for anniversaries/special occasions since we have been married (in 2008), and every experience has been amazing. It really is the best food I have ever eaten. We both start with the Caesar salads which include the most delicious croutons and shaved Parmesan ever. My husband always orders a ribeye which is perfect and I get the stuffed chicken breast with lemon butter and garlic herb cheese. AMAZING. The huge sides are always delicious as well. Our favorites include the potatoes au gratin, shoestring fries, and green beans or garlic mashed potatoes. For dessert you can't go wrong with their homemade cheesecake and chocolate almond bark. We always look forward to our next visit!

When my husband's computer completely crashed, we took it right in to RedSeven. They took care of everything and before we knew it, they called back and told us the computer was up and running and functioning perfectly and to come anytime to pick it up! Their work was excellent, the staff is courteous, and the turn around time for the repair was exceptional.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

The location and atmosphere are fun but the food is just mediocre to me. I'm not sure what all the buzz is about and why there is a line out the door almost constantly. Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong things but the food really doesn't seem to be something extra special that I couldn't make at home.

I'll first say that I love Ulta's coupons but really, that's the only reason. I always, always find that they're out of popular products I need, especially when coupons are out. It's extremely irritating especially when they are the only place that carries a certain product I use daily. This location in particular has extremely rude sales associates. If you ask them a question, don't be surprised if you get a cold shoulder and feel like you've asked them to run a marathon or something. I purposely avoid this location when I have to go to ULTA.

LOVE this place. So many good options on the menu and the kid's menu is one of the best around. Salad bar is amazing and staff and service is always great. We like the patio outside and free ice cream :)

Great place to let kids burn some energy for a few hours. I like that there are plenty of bouncer/interactive options for all ages. They just added gated toddler zones in each room as well. We've attended a few birthday parties here as well and they seem very well run and the kids always have a blast.

We tried Firehouse a few weeks ago and are telling all our friends and family to check them out! The subs are SO good and the variety on their menu is much more extensive than most places. The staff is friendly and I love the atmosphere.  Another huge plus is that they are one of the few restaurants I have been to that has the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine which is AMAZING!!  The only reason I couldn't give them 5 stars is because the service is a bit slow and they have forgotten things both times we have been there for the kids meals (the fire hat and Oreo cookie). Not a huge a deal, of course :)  We will be returning very soon!

Does anyone involved in higher up management read these reviews? Believe what everyone else is saying. Went there this morning with my 2 kids and was never greeted...no one even acknowledged us until I tried to track someone down behind the counter to take our order. We then had to proceed to a dirty table which I had to wipe down myself...we also had a great view of the overflowing trash can. Our bagels came out and I kid you not, the guy basically threw the baskets down at us. I couldn't believe it. Horrible, horrible service here.

This is one of the best Dollar Tree locations around. It's bigger than many other ones with more selection and very organized and clean. Staff is super friendly as well. I love coming here for party supplies, greeting cards, seasonal stuff like pool noodles/swim gear, and of course cleaning supplies.

I think Sub Zero is definitely a hidden secret not many know about. I LOVE their ice cream. It's fun to watch, the choices are endless and the staff is super friendly. I just wish they had more locations! Oh, and if you're looking for a safe bet, order the cake batter flavor and add in cookie dough. It's amazing!

This place is a family favorite. If I were to compare it to Subway I don't think they'd even be in the same world. It's THAT good. Everything is extremely fresh and you can tell. They have numerous sandwich choices you can order hot or cold but their toasted subs are what they're known for. I'm always impressed when we come here. So happy they're expanding to new locations!! The kids meals are also a great deal, so inexpensive!!

I'll update my rating once they fix the horrendous bee problem they have!!! We couldn't even enjoy ourselves without worrying about getting stung everywhere we went. Bees at the train station, during the ride, at the playground, and especially around the trash cans. It was miserable. Such a shame because it is a beautiful park and the playground is one of the best in AZ.

I hate giving two stars to one of our favorite sub places but this location just cannot get it together! Yesterday marked our 3rd awful experience in less than 8 months. We chose to dine in and watched as several customers behind us received their food to go before us. Not something that's fun to deal with when you have young children who are hungry and waiting. 3 out of our 4 subs were made incorrectly and it was very obvious the staff was lacking any sort of management or direction. It was not a pleasant experience and was quite frankly annoying. We won't be back to this location.

After speaking with management, it is obvious they care about customer feedback and I'm glad they seem to be getting on top of things.

Ate there last night with my husband and outside of the exceptional customer service and good prices (hence the two stars), I will never be back. I ordered the mild boneless wings with fries and was completely disappointed. The sauce had way too much of a "buttery" taste and one of the ingredients the fries were seasoned with was SUGAR! So disgusting. Is this a new thing?? About an hour and a half eating there I got mild food poisoning. Although it's hard to 100% blame them as the cause...I would bet a lot of money my wings weren't cooked properly. I'll be sticking with Buffalo Wild Wings.

Not much to say. I was very underwhelmed with this place. The customer service was pretty good and flavor choices were also a plus. However, my ice cream had significant amounts of ice chunks in it and my children's did too...almost as if it was old or freezer burned. Just inexcusable at an ice cream parlor that charges you over $3 for a single scoop. We'll be sticking to Baskin Robbins or Coldstone. I really wanted to like this place!
