Everybody who thinks about coming here should go to the real Giuseppe's, in Scottsdale.  I grew up eating at this location pretty much my whole life. So many great memories of the spot but unfortunately the change in ownership left this place with shoddy food.   Everyone who rates this place above a two, please do yourselves a favor and try the location in Scottsdale (13610 N Scottsdale Rd). The difference is stark.

I grew up eating Pasquale's food along with, when I had saved room, his wife's incredible desserts. The charm of the owner and the conviviality that is found in his restaurant always made it a real treat to eat there. Most of these happy memories occurred while he was at the location on 28th St. and Indian School... Which is no longer under his control. This location is where the talent that originated 'Giuseppe's on 28th' ended up.   The food here is absolutely delicious. Not a fancy, pretentious place, just consistently great food. BYOB with no fancy interior, this place defies so many Scottsdale norms it should seemingly fail. It's usually got a good many people in it, because I'm not the only one that knows, I'm just sharing the knowledge with all my Yelpin' peeps :]  I'm yelping this here restaurant because I feel I have to right a wrong. You see, the Giuseppe's on 28th [why did they let them keep the name? I'll never know] was featured the Food TV show "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives." Cashing in on the reputation built by Pasquale, these guys overcharge for crappy renditions of the dishes I grew up loving.   If you really want to see the difference, try the eggplant parmesan sandwich at both locations. Really there can be no comparison. Or the rich, artery-clogging Alfredo sauce... Oh god just writing about it is making me realize I need to go back soon.  So, I put it to you, my fellow yelpers... Can you give this place a try and tell me if I'm right? I admit there's a chance I could be over-romanticizing due to my childhood experiences... But everyone I've brought here has been equally enamored with the food and with Pasquale.

Amazing food. Top two in AZ for Indian [other being Star of India in Ahwatukee]. I love that they have paneer tikka masala on the buffet every day. Butter/Tomato sauce and you get to enjoy it if you're a vegetarian! Sooo good. They also usually have delicious renditions oif Saag Paneer, Daal Mahrani[sp] Chicken Vindaloo and Chicken Tikka Masala. I try not to eat commodity meat so I tend to avoid the chicken. Sometimes I cannot help myself and I go for the Vindaloo sauce which has sad-chicken juices in it... So tasty :\  The biggest drawback to the place is the service. Don't get me wrong, it's very friendly and well intentioned. But it totally lacks in that fluid, excellent service that can elevate a restaurant experience. The owners handle the service [as well as seemingly everything else] and this can lead to occasional long waits to get your check, or have your card run. There's also a language gap, which would make it difficult for somebody who doesn't know Indian cuisine to get informed answers to questions about the menu.  It's also, as other have mentioned, a bit of a bummer to me that they have a FULL bar, and yet I cannot imagine that if I ordered a drink other than a rum and coke they'd possibly get it right. I know most people don't go to Indian food to get sauced but it's always nice to have the option, particularly if they're going to have the full bar.  Despite all these negatives, I still rate the place tops, second only to Star of India [where the food is at least as good, if not slightly better, and everybody speaks English fluently]  I recently moved very close to this place, which has been a real trial of temptation. So far I've limited myself to no more than twice a month but I'm not sure how long I can keep up that level of restraint :]

Lux, lux, lux. What can be said that hasn't been said by *checks the count* haha, 1000+ folks!?   Well, not much I suppose. It is not a coffee shop you go to for \just\ coffee. The ambiance and quality of the place seeps into every choice made here. They serve hot food, amazing pastries, great coffee and bespoke adult beverages. The staff are friendly [though admittedly some don't come across that way; more a consequence of the insane business and crushing throng they have to deal with].

So happy to be the first to review this wonderful new Thai spot!  As I am the first I'm going to be a bit... verbose. That is my nature by default and here I feel it is somewhat justified, so pardon the upcoming lack of concision.   I'm one of those who rates Thai food right after sushi as far as favorite cuisines go. As such, I have tried just about every Thai restaurant in the valley [and have many favorite dishes at varying places]. Thai Paradise is newcomer but it does a stellar job of living up to its name.   The decor is pleasant, bright and vibrant. The chairs are the weakest link comfort-wise, but they're not major enough of a hindrance to prevent enjoying the food. It's pretty small and as such there aren't very many tables [I didn't count but I'd guess it wouldn't seat more than 20 at a time].   Went there to eat dinner with six other hungry [or, four hungry, two starving] yogis after a heated yoga class at the always excellent Inner Vision Yoga [just one mile west of this restaurant]. Upon arrival we ordered drinks and apps [Thai Iced Tea, Iced Coffee, "Thai Lemonade," crab puffs and egg rolls]. Drinks came out immediately, and were all delicious. I am not much of a coffee drinker but I would down one of those Thai Coffees any day of the week. VERY tasty [same for the Iced Tea]. The lemonade is homemade and tasted like it had lime and also some salt in it. I wasn't really crazy about the salt to be honest, as I LIKE the puckery sourness of lemonade. One diner said it tasted like a virgin margarita, and that's pretty right on.  The apps arrived and this was our first indication that we were in for really excellent service. The orders come with six to an order, which we knew would leave one person wanting in our party of seven... Not so! As the owner added an extra of each with no charge so we could all enjoy. The crab puffs and egg rolls were fantastic, but the real star of the appetizer course was the dipping sauce. Unexpectedly subtle and complex in flavor, clearly not a throwaway. Not that plasticy sweet n sour garbage you get at a lot of places, this was delicate but flavorful and perfect for balancing the richness of the fried food.  The entr√©es arrived very promptly and all were delicious. I am a fan of a lot of heat in my Thai food, but we were doing it family style so I couldn't order anything 'thai hot.' I'll be back very soon to try that level of spice so I can comment on it. As they were, everything was very tasty. We tried several old standbys: Pad Thai, [Tofu] Red Curry and Pad see ew. All were fabulous [though I wish we could've ordered them hotter]. We also ordered some of the place's special dishes that are definitely not Thai standards.   "Rama shrimp" is fried shrimp in a panang-ish curry on top of fresh spinach and served with crispy noodles. Pretty great, unlike anything I've had before.   My favorite though was the "Seafood Spaghetti" Ridiculous amount of flavor in this dish. Scallops, mussels, shrimp and actual spaghetti with some kind of INSANE sauce.   Didn't get a chance to try their mango sticky rice dessert, which is my favorite dessert in all of dessert-dom, but will definitely do so next time.   The value of this place is phenomenal, great portion sizes for very reasonable prices. Clearly the owners recognize that serving amazing food at a great price is a recipe for success.  All in all I can't wait to eat here again and try more of the menu. Like, all of it.  edit: I just wanted to elaborate, as I've had some messages inquiring about the value... When I say value, I mean it! Seven of us ate for $67 dollars. That's including drinks and appetizers. Ridiculous, given the tastiness of it all.

THE BEST salsa bar in AZ. Amazing everything else, but the salsa bar alone is worth the price of admission.  Expansive menu, the kind that normally would be cause for concern. Yet, everything on it comes out perfect.   I love the fried shrimp tacos and the carne sandwich thing [I forget what they call it now but it's NOT a torta]  The horchata is diabetes in a glass and absolutely worth it [share with a friend, or bring your insulin]

Believe the hype.   Delicious Oaxacan Mexican food, most especially the fish tacos [which I pretty much always and sometimes exclusively get]. The guacamole sauce and the fish tacos are all I need. But their horchata and churros also frequently get my attention.   You can't really go wrong here, I have never had a bad thing. Service is friendly [doubly so if you're patient, and sarcastic] and the decor is like an upscale prison. But it hardly matters, because the food is good enough that you'll be back again and again.  Biggest complaints:   1] The baggies of onions and peppers [serranos?] that accompany every order are fried in the oil rather than roasted [which would draw out their flavor more in my opinion]  2] They aren't open Sun/Mon :D

Feels weird to review something other than a restaurant so positively but I felt compelled after my recent experiences with AccountingProse.  As a small business owner [computer janitor], I was not unhappy with the bookkeeper I was already using when I heard about AccountingProse. A friend who runs a few businesses suggested I look at their services and pricing and see if it might be worth switching. This is a person who I trust implicitly about food, drink and music, so why not business services?  Upon my first meeting with Cristina [the boss? I think, not sure. She has the air of a boss if that makes sense :p] I knew instantly I would switch over for one very simple reason:  Passion.  That's right, passion. This lady is just plain nutty about numbers and hell bent on doing the best possible job she can. And it is clear how this impacts her work. I always try and bring this level of service to my customers, and I never felt this level of give-a-shit from previous bookkeepers. It has been extremely refreshing working with her. In the past three months I have:  *Paid less for my bookkeeping services *Gotten vastly better service *Reduced overhead [a.k.a. increased profits] with a few cool tricks she brought to my attention [details that never seemed to catch the eye of my former firm]  I have also recommended AccountingProse to just about everybody I know. The person who recommended to me is one of those extremely finicky people whose opinion I knew I could trust. Most of my friends see me the same way.    I cannot suggest highly enough that you contact them and determine for yourself if you feel like you are being fully served by your present bookkeeper.

I'm never eating here again! Food is by no means abominable, sometimes it's even \quite\ good [soups especially], but the service is just not there. I am tired of being made to feel like I'm inconveniencing people whose job it is to provide a service.   This might be my most frustrated yelp review ever.  I like the people but constantly feel like customer service is the last priority here. Today was the last straw. Last time I was there [before today], I ordered a BBQ sandwich and the bottom bun was so soaked through and drippy that there was no eating it as a sandwich. I raised this complaint to the barkeep, who registered that I'd spoken words, but did nothing further to acknowledge the situation. Literally imagine "Um, this isn't quite right, the bottom is completely soaked through" met with a half interested "Oh?" and then nothing. Moved on. ...Ok.   So today I finally got over my frustration f to check out their "WTF Wednesday" special, a muffuletta. I asked whether it was grilled, told it wasn't, I asked that it be grilled [my preference being for some crusty bread to go with all that mush in the middle].   Barkeep heard and confirmed my ask. Sandwich is ready, and given my past experiences here, I check the food before leaving [I'm so not that person usually]... and the bread is plain and dry, not grilled, not toasted [despite the cook claiming it was].   I ask "Was it not possible to grill the bread?" to the barkeep.   So here's what kills me and why I wont be back [for food]: Rather than being asked how the problem can be fixed, I get an explanation from the cook about how what I wanted was wrong.   ...  I'm paying money for food. That means it has to be better than something I can make myself. And, it has to be to my liking. That's just a fact of the market; if you're in a service industry, the food has to be UNGODLY good to be the 'no modifications/substitutions' type of place. This is not that place. So being told how things 'should be' in the face of twice expressing an unmet preference is just shitty shitty shitty service. Especially when I'm asking for something as simple as grilling a sandwich. It's not busy, I'm the only one in the place... yet I'm being told why I shouldn't want what I want, rather than being asked how things can be fixed.   Terrible service instincts abide at this place and it will prevent me from recommending it to people, especially when there are so many superior options in the surrounding area.   As I mentioned, I do genuinely like the people at this spot; they're overall nice and I support their success. But I feel like every time I raise a concern I am met with indifference, so why bother raising concerns if they fall on deaf ears?  Sincerely hope a focus on service can turn things around here; it's a great space with some positive attributes and I hope it thrives. I just wont support it like I normally would prefer because I don't send my friends to places with bad service.
