Cool diner in the middle of my changing neighborhood. Lots of wild conversations , no space inside and the kitchen is Right in ur face! My friend Olivia was drinkin something sweet lol, and I'm not sure what it was called but good mix! Enjoyed the bumble bee chicken sandwich , dijon mustard and honey on top of the bread was bomb!  I didn't sit outside but it looked nice , but I did dig the inside and enjoyed myself. This place is hipsterific and I'm fine with that, come here for a different taste of Phx...  4 STARS

I walked in a few Saturday's ago and needed a nice cut, I went to Mike. He was very professional and gave me the cut I wanted and more. My other barber bailed on me at the last minute and I wasn't sure how my experience would go here. Its an older more established barbershop, I'm glad i walked in, because its a comfortable environment inside and close to my place in dtwn.. Wasn't too crowded on a Saturday either and gives you a down home barbershop vibe and def less big headed about there styles here...   WILL BE BACK!  5 STARS

I came here tonight with my sister for My Mom's birthday. Our waitress was on her ish and had a lot of spunk and personality. I appreciate that these days...   The food was delicious and all of us ordered something different to all sample as one. I had Steak and Shrimp along with the Spicy Hibachi Chicken. My mom had colossal shrimp and my sister had the seaside trio.   It can get pricey if you just order what looks good w/o looking at its price, however sometimes you have to spend a little to EAT GOOD! lol.  The fried rice and our chefs vegetables also hit the spot ! Overall really impressive place to eat for a birthday or special occasion.  4 STARS

I can only call it for Friday nights w/Soul Power, but It's definitely one of the most entertaining live music venues in Phoenix Period! The place has a good vibration about it...hard to describe unless you've actually been inside this crawl space..lol   Literally it's small and not much space to move around, but the spot is live, has great drinks and service. Come for the good time and leave the snobbery at the doe!  5 STARS

This my fix when I want cheap and easy mexican food quick!   open 24 hours, so if your hungry and leaving the club in Scottsdale its nothing to take a cab down the street and get a burrito from this spot I have only tried the breakfast burrito and the California both are delicious..  cant go wrong with 24 hr Mexican food especially this spot..

This is pretty good place to workout overall. You have a lot of different machines and free weights. I usually go in the mid afternoons when it is less crowded. It can get annoying with the crowds of people late at night, but that just tells me that people are trying to get back in shape and they are doing so at this establishment.   Keep in mind you are not there to worry about others, but there to get the body you want and feel better after your done.   Its a gym, a nice large and spacious one, never heard a DJ, they play top 40 music, but most people wear headsets or just focus on the workout. The staff is real cool people, they work with you if you allow them too, and people are cool overall too.  4 Stars

not the best pizza in the world, but not the torture chamber many our describing on Yelp.. lol. The pizza is very greasy and it feels almost undercooked most of the time, I am usually faded beyond belief whenever I eat at Gus's otherwise I would make a more logical decision never to come here. So if your just that wasted and need to consume some food before AM, come here and full up. Its convenient AF so I can't complain, but its pretty Shitty pizza smh.

After coming to Vegas the previous week for my birthday and staying at the palms, I was a little less impressed with the idea of coming to vegas to party and enjoying yourself like a king. Fast-Forward to 3/20/11, I arrive with the fam around from PHX after a long 5 hour drive we step into this compound of a hotel, with gold everywhere. Lavish interior, pretty females, and tons of bars and great food made me change my outlook on LV in just a few minutes.   The room was big enough to hold four of us, and the hotel gave us a deal on some lion king tickets, and free drinks #Winning !   We only stayed for one night, but we spent the rest of the day gambling, drinking lol, and checking out some of the sights and other hotels (Luxor) wasn't impressed lol..  Anyways this hotel is bomb, with great views, big rooms, nice casino floor, doesn't smell like smoke and his great service. Definitely would stay here again!  4 STARS

I ate at this buffet on 3/20-3/21 for dinner and brunch. Basically all the food was on point, and they had all types to offer for dinner. I had steak chops, potatoes, shrimp Alfredo pasta, coconut shrimp and crabs legs. I splurged lol! I also enjoyed the brunch, tons of choices but i stuck with the omelette, french toast, corn beef hash, and has browns. It is on the expensive side, but the food is worth the price you pay. Come Hungry and give yourself plenty of time to rest after smashing down that food !

this review is for the BAR not the nightclub.   I purchased two drinks worth $10 each, and i gave 3 dollar tip. I awake the next morning to see text messages from my bank saying i was low in funds and near overdrawing. I was confused because I had ample funds the previous day. I check my statement and see my account has been charged $100 by the idiot bartenders trying to slick out ppls hard earned money...   so basically, word of advice is bring cash, and check your accounts the next day because these fools have nothing better to do than to rip folksk off.. FAIL

gotta try the carmel chicken just once, its bomb!   I don't have any major complaints but the interior was really big and spacious, I was sort of surprised by this. The amount of food you get for the price is good , I don't think it was price unreasonably at all.   Oh props for their drink machines they have over 107 different flavors of beverages. LOL   4 STARS

5 Stars is saying a lot about the quality of your dining experience at Pappadeaux.  -I've been here probably over five times since I've lived in AZ and every experience is top notch!  Our server was really chill, laid back and even though very busy always checked to see if we needed anything. Most people these days even if the place is dead will not even check on you unless they are looking to drop off the bill.   -The food is bomb, I had Stuffed Jumbo Shrimp wrapped in bacon over dirty rice (recommended).  Atmosphere is fun and poppin all on a Sunday at that! I was really surprised.   -Beast Seafood in AZ hands down for the reasons above, I would definitely check it out if your in town and want some good food and southern hospitality in the desert.   5 STARS

I came a while back maybe in November, and was craving some chicken. I knew the name sounded familiar, because I went to a Louisiana Fried Chicken out in California. I knew the menu was gonna be different because they are separately owned franchises. However, the food was still on point.   I got the chicken tenders, fries and a drink REAL SIMPLE.  The chicken was hot and spicy very good, and the service was pretty quick took less than 10 minutes there was a good amount of ppl waiting inside as well as outside chilling outside.   I def would go back here over popeyes or churches!   4 STARS

wow! what an upgrade from LA Fitness.. with that being said, you can already tell this review will be positive.   I recently re-joined 24 hour fitness, after breaking off my membership back in early 2010 after moving away from home. I join LA fitness last January, and was less than satisfied with the broken equipment and that meatheads that seemed to frequent the south Scottsdale location.   Man what a nice ass gym, It's free weights and machines are all located next to each other and not scattered around everywhere. The cardio machines are in great condition and It was not super crowded where you felt the need to shorten up your workout.  Staff was friendly and not pushy like LA Fitness.. and Lockerrooms are clean.  Basically, this is a nice new facility that anybody would be comfortable working out at and its close to my school so thats also a MAJOR plus!  4 STARS

I stayed here with my lady last night and it didn't disappoint! I had the sixth floor suite with a nice view of the airport and the city lights. The bed was comfortable and had plenty of leg room for my 6-2 self LOL   The bartender helped me add an extra star to the review , very strong drinks and friendly attentive service enjoying the other guest having a good time.   The overall look of the hotel is very modern, and hip I would recommend it to someone on business or pleasure as the room has a desk and plenty of comfort for just a few nights stay.  4 STARS

Every time i come here my experience is less than satisfying.. I don't know if its the fact that this place is trying to be urban and hip, but instead it's a bunch of overpriced stores and pretentious restaurants.   The parking -1, I mean what the hell was the person thinking who design this place, parking is confusing and people try run down the back of your ass to get passed you to park.. I mean why are u in such a hurry though? calm all the way down!  The vibe. -1 . umm there wasn't a vibe to speak of, yeah some people were dinning and out and about walking around but most of the mall seemed dead.   People -1 Pretentious.. like let me valet my honda accord so I look super cool kind of pretentious LOL ..   Honestly the only good thing here is the Apple Store, I love the design and the customer service is friendly whenever I've been there. H&M's men section sucks, and The Nike Store is overpriced like SHIT..  yup I will try to avoid coming here in the future.. Fashion Square, hell even Kierland is a better option. MUCH BETTER VIBES  2 LONELY STARS.

I came in here today for the first time at this location. I had to philly chicken pita and they made it spicy for me by request. The pita was bomb with tons of flavor. I had some pita chips on the side, definitely puts any fries I've had in the past to shame.   Another thing I liked is that the whole place was Live and packed with people, who were on lunch break and just relaxing enjoying the weather outside in the patio area. The service is great, and I like the vibe   I Would Def come back again !

Great and attentive service on a Sunday for Brunch!   I had the breakfast sandwich with a side of home fries....slayed!   Bottomless mimosas is a star in itself, and the waitress was always on it when it came to refills for the group.   Music was bumping, and it feel like a club on a Sunday, I definitely enjoyed myself, maybe a little too much with the mimosas but all in all i give this place 4 solid stars..   ILL BE BACK.

Took my girl here for Valentines and had a genuinely excellent time here. There was live  music and the place was pretty bumpin but it didn't slow down the service or make me feel overly anxious to order.   I had the spicy noddles with chicken.. Medium was hot as hell to me but the flavor was bomb! My lady had the honey chicken with rice and we ordered spring rolls and crab wontons for appetizers, everything was hot and cooked perfectly.  The prices are good for what you get and ha drinks were both 6.99 which made my heart smile even more.  I def will be back to get a drink or order a quick lunch and will recommend it to others!   5 stars

This a review for 8/21/2011  I saw the 945PM Show With Bruce Bruce with my lady friend and overall had a good time with the people around me.  WHAT I LIKED 1). The first thing I liked about "Stand Up Live" is how everyone sits together, and there is no individual tables. Its people enjoying the energy and taking in the night as one.. DOPE  2). I like that it's small and not some huge overwhelming theater that you feel you can't stand up and move around in, its personal and the audience was in conversation with Bruce Bruce throughout the night.. nice LAYOUT.  3.) Food was good, all we had were chicken tenders but sometimes food at entertainment venues can be disappointing so that's a PLUS.    WHAT NEEDS WORK  1). Service is slow at times, I know its a busy weekend for "Stand Up Live" but ultimately its about getting orders correct, and making sure the guest are being checked on every once in a while. NEEDS WORK.  2.) prices were kinda high for just drinks and an appetizer.. damn Bottle of Water was 5.00 a piece like SMDH...to high for water im sorry no excuse.  other than the bottom two compliants I think the venue is Unique, dope and relaxed. Crowd was nice, food was good, Entertainment was excellent, host was on point, and The tickets were affordable..   Definitely coming back downtown for another show soon!   4 STARS

I came here this afternoon because I was feenin for some sushi and heard good things about this place.   I parked on the street to create less stress for myself so I can't talk to much about the parking situation..so.. lets get over that lol!  I had a shrimp roll with crunchy tempura on top with 3 side sauces, sweet chilli, a peanut flavored one ( wasn't feeling this) and the Spicy mayo (My favorite). The workers are really dope and friendly, and walked me through the whole process of choosing veggies, wraps, meat etc. I was pretty full after my meal and would def be back whenever I'm in the area.. too bad I don't work downtown anymore, this place would be real convenient and has a great return factor  4 STARS**

Good option versus Autozone and I like the service of the young dude on the night shift while I had issues with a dead battery. They tested it and it came back completely drained, I got a good price for my accord and was set back on the road within 20 mns. They have good service, and they helped me out.. good looks!  5 STARS

So Good!!! deliciously flavored Mexican food in North Scottsdale...a rare find.   This place is right by the Gun Club lol.. anyways lets just say i called up in advance to pick up my order and glad I did so.. Ordered a carne asada burrito with a fried fish taco, along with 2 tostadas and the pork carnitas enchiladas for mom dukes.   Everything had flavor and sauce was spicy not bland and mild like some places are in strip malls. The service was pleasant and very attentive to the customer didn't just eyeball me or stare when i asked for extra napkins lol.   Ill continue to drop by... but won't eat here every week just due to my good health ha.  5 STARS

Came here with a date last night, it was my first dinning experience downtown on a friday night, and Blue Hound definitely lived up to its reputation.  We sat in the outside patio, and it was nice and cool out and more private than the main floor.   This place has a hip vibe, and was nicely packed at the time, the food menu was way different than I expected, but most of the items we ordered were SMASHING.  -Ribs fell off the bone, and tasted rich and actually mixed pretty damn well with blue cheese grits..who woulda thought that?   -Corn on the Cob, (mexican street style as my waiter said) were my favorite though, you gotta try this one time, the taste is explosive lol...   -Tater Tots- bomb-tastic, better than I've had in a minute, which is saying a lot. ha  Service was strange, but attentive. Not all in your face, which could be a good thing or bad thing for some people. Our waiter was chill though.   drinks wre str8, but not strong which was probably a good thing in my case, lol.   Would love to support a local business like this more on the regular, and recommend it to everyone.  4 STARS.

Great Steak!!!   I was excited to try it out and it didn't dissapoint, I got four nice sized tacos with plain flour tortilla and carne... you gotta prepare it yourself and get everything you need which I DIG! The flavor in the steak rivals someplace you pay $$ for but its a little cut place off Buckeye and its hard to see if your not paying attention lol.   I will be back, cuz I owe the nice miss at the cashier $0.25 since i didn't have change to break even on my purchase. Mucho Amor!

Service is sketchy , didn't feel welcome here and I was so ready to get my to go order. I'm not threatening in any way shape or form, but from the bouncer to the dude taking my order I felt like my business was not appreciated.   The tacos were also way too spicy, and my ex girl is from Mexico so I know you can make street tacos without the fire and still be flavorful.   Beer was nasty!  The whole place it just seemed really like an awkward display of bro macho and fake transplant that decided to make Mexican food at an open air bar with a Scottsdale touch of snobbery.  I will not comeback  1 STARS

Diverse crowd , strong drinks and amazing happy hour prices .. Tequila sunrise 3 rounds =$15 !!! Dope!   Nice space outside, great weather yesterday so took advantage of the patio. I heard Sundays are live with a DJ, I def want to go back then. My bartender was accommodating and always made sure I had a full drink! The place was clean and made me feel at home.. Will be back!   5 stars

This place has awesome service, experienced bartenders and good vibes...  My visit today is worth a 4 Star review alone for the happy hour special $5 Jose Cuervo Margaritas. I ordered a few just to be honest with y'all, and each drink was smooth and strong. They have a heavy poor which i dig, plus they have some great chips and salsa   To eat I had the pastor chicken tacos, hmmm I probably would get another type next time, lots of flavor but I should stick to what I know lol.   Oh and this place is clean, employees didn't feel rushed or panicked and has a diverse crowd of ages 17-55 pretty cool to see!   4 STARS

good service, nice size carne asada tacos!  magarita was okay not amazing, could've used less juice and more alcohol..but I'm not the bartender here.   Didn't see the price, but $2 tacos on Tuesday and a $8 degree Margarita in the middle of downtown tempe is alright w/me!  Ill come back here and continued to bring outta-town friends.. 4 STARS

Stopped in here yesterday evening because I was curious as to the set-up since it looked identical to something I saw in Memphis. The service is moderate not fast, but the people are friendly and help you out. Everything is laid out in front of you which is dope... Loved the minced garlic and basil! $10 for an 11 inch pepperoni and bacon with drink, good bet I'll be back through here soon!

I'm Glad we have First Fridays here in Phoenix. It brings in a lot of the diversity, worldly remedies and most interesting art scene known to the Southwest. When i first walked up to the side of Desoto, my friend Drey opened the back door and we entered into what felt like a an art museum mixed with a food court and full bar. The DJ was fire, had a lot of great alternative, r&b (feel good) type tracks blazing. Minimal wait time at the bar, my guy (cant recall name) but cop me a tequila sunrise because the first was made too spicy for my liking! $5.47 for my 1st drink, can you say leggo!  The service was awesome at The YardBird, i recommend the Catfish...super bomb! Sit outside on the patio if the weather allows, this past weekend was fall like for Phoenix ;-)   Definitely visit worthy, and has great retention value. 4 STARS
