Worst customer service EVER.  This is a repeat offense with the car audio install bay.    The rep Anthony has a really offensive sales tactic of treating customers like idiots.  He must have some kind of super power because he told me (over the phone) that what I had in my car currently sounded "okay" but not as good as it could if I bought some new speakers in addition to the deck I was inquiring about having installed.    You know what Anthony, I'll go to Fry's or better yet order from Crutchfield.

Rude staff, incompetent nurse practitioner.  I have been coming here for about 6 years and used to love it when Heather Leazure was here. Now I have had to deal with incorrectly written scripts every time which require me to revisit the office to have them rewritten.  This time, their lack of experience and skill have left me without my medication for over two weeks now.   When I attempt to get someone to adjust the script I get nothing but attitude from the front desk including being mocked and laughed at.  Go elsewhere unless you want to have to micromanage your prescriptions and deal with the overworked (and probably underpaid) staff's snarky and impatient demeanor.

The car I got was awesome, 2015 Camry SE - I'm pretty sure the girl at the counter hooked me up because I signed up for economy = sweet!   I only used half a tank of gas and they wanted to charge me $59!!!  Thank goodness the guy who took my car in advised me to go fill up to avoid the charge.  I saved myself $47 thanks to him.  The price was the lowest I found $17/day  (not bad), the car was really nice and the customer service is what sells me on this company.  I will definitely look at Hertz for my next car rental experience.

Italian grocery - you can find what you need here for your next authentic Italian meal and they have the BEST sandwiches!  Cheesesteaks and cold Italian subs to die for. Get it on a sub roll!  I love that I can acquire obscure ingredients and enjoy a delicious pesto gnocchi, Italian sub and rich dessert that is noteworthy here.  Pro tip: call ahead.

So this place delivers - that's nice.  A co-worker of mine ordered a round of breakfast for us and I'm already full of regret.  Veggie Omelet - $8 + $1 for cheese. Choice of 3 veggies, the eggs are definitely egg beaters and taste like sugar was added. The provolone cheese was placed neatly atop the omelet and melted into a gelatinous blanket. This omelet is tasteless and has an oily feel in my mouth. Gross.  This came with a side of cold, soggy potatoes, also flavorless.   Cheese Danish - $1-$2 for a danish that clearly came from some crappy Costco. It was dry and had a minuscule amount of cheese filing.  GROSS unless you have extremely low standards and don't mind dropping 12 bucks for a breakfast that may as well have come from a low income middle school cafeteria.

What I like about Lux is the open inviting space for people to co-work while enjoying a brew of the alcoholic or the coffee variety, order some tantalizing grub.  Great place to get some work done, and bump into some friendly like minded individuals.    The reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the coffee that I got on my second round was not the best and there is no cover on the patio.    Today it rained all day and as rare as that is, I feel a covered patio is even more coveted in the hot summer months.  I believe a coffee shop should have a covered patio.  As a coffee bar, I wish the coffee was better, not saying it is bad, just not the best.    Overall, liked Lux and will definitely work here again as I just relocated to the Downtown Phoenix area.

Best burger in the valley if you ask me. The service is sometimes hit or miss, but the food is amazing!   They now have a "To Go" half of the restaurant that has a more casual vibe than the main dining area/bar. They always have nice beer on tap, Ballast Point's Sculpin IPA is there right  meow, need I say more?  Fries - get the mixed basket of sweet potato and regular shoe string.  The creamy dipping sauce (CRanch?) is zingy and addicting - you've been warned! Delux Burger - Nieman Ranch beef definitely fresh, juicy, flavorful and the bread is so soft and perfectly toasted with complimenting sauteed onions.   This place has other yum things on the menu, but if it's your first time go with my recommendation. You won't be sorry.

Restaurant Mexico is Mexican food for people who don't like spice, or warm food.   I've tried several items here and I always feel the same, like I'm eating air. Everything seems watered down and flavorless. What I do love about this place is it is a family owned spot and their food is very simple and some people probably love that.  For me, I want to taste the garlic and I don't want my guac to consist of basically squashed avocados and tomatoes.   My usual suspect is the Clare Burro. It has lovely whole cooked beans and is topped with a tomatillo salsa. Sounds good right? Well, it always seems cold, the salsa is thin and I just never feel satisfied by the flavor.  The quesadillas are very unique in that they are Mexico City style so it is a bunch of corn meal that has been deep fried and the meat is inside. NO CHEESE! HA! It is very good if you're interested in sort of a fried tamale sans cheese.   The one thing on the menu that IS really good is the flan! Oh the flan is the silkiest and smoothest flan I've ever had with little caramel crunchies on the edges. ! Interesting fact ! They don't make it in house!!! That's right, the one thing on the menu that is good is brought in by a local baker lady who makes flan deliveries once a week. Put that in your chalupa and smoke it.

As someone who has traveled extensively throughout India and sampled various regions of authentic Indian cuisine, I find that Udupi keeps the best parts of traditional Indian fare and omits the overwhelming amount of oil that is often used heavily in preparation.  The items I tried were the Palaak Paneer, Cauliflower Gobi Manchurian, Lentil Soup and Spinach Dosai. We went for dinner and the buffet was not available so we ordered a la carte.  Every single thing including the rice that was delicately flavored with spices, was 100% without a doubt some of the most flavorful, fresh and well-balanced Indian food I've ever put in my mouth.   The balance of the intense and unique spices used in Indian food was exquisite.   Most of the time, Indian food is over powered by one of the flavors or is too high on the scoville scale.   In spite of this modest strip-mall restaurant being nestled in between the Motel 6, a laundromat and Jim's Coney Island Grill, it is without a doubt my favorite Indian restaurant in the valley.

Since when does a tall peppermint mocha get rung up with an extra shot?  When I asked why she was ringing it in, my salt and peppered, rotund barista replied that's just how they ring it in. Is this true? Why am I paying extra?  When I asked for a receipt she said they were out of tape. Really???  The drink isn't even good. Ordered it "skinny" and it tastes like they poured the entire bottle of peppermint syrup in there. I realize the peppermint isn't sugar free but come on guys...  I realize this is Starbucks and one bad review isn't going to stop the masses from suckling on the sugary, caffeine teat, but it I was managing this location, I'd evaluate my current staff.

So this place was open late and we swung through for a burro and some nachos. Everything was pretty standard and comparable to a Filiberto's or a Roliberto's or one of those 'berto's taco shops.  Everything was pretty basic and standard, had a nice garlic flavor in the beans, but maybe nachos isn't the thing to get. They were just bad. Poorly proportioned and the cheese was just a cold glob shook on the sides. The chips were all soggy in the center and there were hardly any toppings.   I might give it another try, but probably not. I guess it's better than 'berto's!  Can't expect much from a place like this I suppose but hey, it's a good spot for a bean burro!

Do you enjoy cutting the roof of your mouth on burnt spring rolls?   Slicing into my delicate palate is typically a cherished experience that lasts for days as I run my tongue over the loose flaps of skin left behind by the sharp edges of over-toasted sandwich bread; today my adoration for mouth injuries seems to be on a hiatus.  My fickle love affair with Pei Wei ended the moment I discovered they discontinued the green coconut curry dish, however, I do occasionally break down for some tofu Pad Thai and the occasional crab won ton.  The location on 7th Ave and McDowell is conveniently located and has become a place where I make emergency dining decisions.   A mere month ago a friend of mine and I dined in for a business meeting and the service was so horrible and inconsistent with the menu description that the manager, Anthony, gave us a $10 gift card credit to use the next time we came in in addition to a comp of the dish in question.  I appreciate that the management was willing to save a couple of potential repeat customers, kudos for that.  Anthony, if you are still managing this location; please stop doing so many lines of cocaine during your break. Perhaps drinking on the job and soliciting young, impressionable cashiers is not the best use of your time.   Whatever it is that you are doing Mr. or Ms. manager of Pei Wei Downtown Phoenix, please stop it at once and focus on the piss poor quality of food that you are cranking out on the regular.   My Pad Thai was soggy, overcooked and flavorless. Unless they have recently updated their recipes, I would wager to say that this was sent back by an in-house patron and re-heated for my enjoyment.  The potstickers were blackened around the edges and cooked to the point where the insides had shriveled to the size of a nickel.    No matter how hungry I get, I will never in all of my days spend another dime in this establishment.  Kthxbai xo

This place has pretty fresh sushi and an interesting cocktail and beer list, however the service is absolute shite.   We did come in at 10 when closing time was 11, but when we noticed no one else in the restaurant and they were sweeping the floor, we offered to come back another time. The staff insisted we are welcome and proceeded to wait on us.   We ordered quickly, and ate equally as fast but the guys working there continued to clean up around us (which is fine) and dim the lights. I felt like this was a signal to get out which - I get, but it wasn't even 11 (closing time) RUDE!  The music was blaring and at first it was okay (Drum and Bass) but then it kept going with high pitched Skrillex style EDM and was killing the vibe. I guess I should have asked them to change it, but come on man . . .

That svelt, man bun wielding wealth of beer & music knowledge: Issa was kind enough to introduce me to Founders Mosaic Promise on Cask ! ! !   I believe one of the many descriptors he used for this refreshing palate pleaser was "herbaceous".   Rock on TOT, rock on Issa.

John Fagundes needs to hire a few more staff, or maybe he should take a course in customer service.   This company took two weeks to respond to an inquiry about a townhouse for rent and when they finally did, the woman was rude and impatient over the phone. She iterated that the owner John was extremely busy and simply didn't have the time to deal with this.  This place is awesome if you want to sign a lease agreement on a place you've never seen with your own eyes and if you will never need anything from them throughout your lease term.

So, I am not a vegan, nor am I vegetarian, however, this place rocks my world! Super friendsly (and not overly cheesy) staff, BOMB food, fresh juice, smoothies, espresso and yes, even alcohol.   Raw food options that will blow your mind. The flavor profiles in their dishes are phenomenal. Whoever this chef is knows what's up!  Even if you're not into the whole vegetarian/raw/vegan lifestyle, you will be surprised at how good this place is.   I am currently pregnant and unable to have caffeine and I really miss and crave coffee. The always friendly staff is eager to recommend something new and on my last visit I was turned on to Jnantik. This is a Mayan superfood coffee substitute that actually tastes/smells similar to coffee! They mix it right in with their Pom milk (a blend of various nut and soy milks) and serve it as a latte. So not only did this satisfy my coffee craving, but it is packed with vitamins and minerals to give me a natural energy boost!

I recently purchased a brand new 2015 VW GTI and was given Clean Freak as a recommendation by the sales manager since my car has dark paint.   At first, I really enjoyed being able to take my vehicle in for a wash as often as I liked and I had access to detailing air hoses and vacuums.    My last wash at the Grand Ave / 7th Ave location and I distinctly remember a loud sound and my wheel jerking. I was horrified since I have low profile wheels.  I noticed some gashes in my wheel prior to this date but was assured by the staff at Clean Freak that it was impossible for their wheel mechanism to cause this damage.   I gave them the benefit of the doubt since it was a possibility that I could have done it myself as it was a very small section (2-3 inches) and I didn't notice it right away.   This time, I noticed, and when I inspected my wheel there was at least 10-12 inches of vertical scraping and gashes embedded into my previously pristine wheel. I contacted the manager who wasn't on duty that evening and he assured me that there was no way it was their equipment.   He offered to do these things:  Run the car through the wash to prove to me that it was fine.  Watch the surveillance video. Come in so that he can see it and there is no way he can advise me if he hasn't seen it.  I drove in immediately. He said based on the looks of it that there is no way it was the car wash and it was clearly curb rash... I brought up the fact that the direction of the scraping is not congruent with a forward movement, he still denied responsibility. I realized he wasn't going to take any so I offered for me to file a claim if he would pay my deductible which he refused flatly.   Upon inspecting the entrance to the wash, there is a dual metal railing that is the exact height of my wheel, I asked him if it was possible for that to have caused the damage and he said, no way. He admitted that he would not assume any responsibility for the damages to my wheel; period. Unles the footage was done from every angle and clearly shows the area in the beginning of the railing, I didn't see how spending another waking second with this joke of a "manager" so I thanked him for his time, snapped some photos and asked to cancel my membership. He did so, but definitely didn't offer to refund me, so I will be billed for the month.   I am pretty upset that now I have to file a claim with my insurance company and pay $500 out of my pocket to have my wheels replaced.   Unless you have a crappy car, I would stay away from this place. If you have low profile wheels, DEFINITELY do not use this service unless you want your wheels mangled.  Do not use #CleanFreakCarWash

Since my very first journey into the bosom of JoBot over a decade ago, much has changed.  They added more delicious food options, traded their cash register for an iPad and opened up the indoor dining space. I must say that I do miss the cozy, homey vibe that came with nestling into the labyrinth-like wooden dining space but I'm happy to see them growing  These crepes are the best! My favorite has fresh spinach, basil, black bean, sun dried tomatoes and the PESTO! I could write an ode to their pesto. It has me dreaming about it, salivating and fantasizing about it...really.  Good coffee, amazing food, cool chill space indoors and out. I also hear they are getting their liquor license - can't wait!

My first visit to this joint was an unexpected delight.  The space is comfy and tastefully hip. My favorite part is the cassette tape lined wall leading into the hall to Churn and the shared unisex bathrooms.  This place is very much a come as you are yet slightly fancy mix of fine dining flare and gastro pub in terms of decor and menu.  We ordered the Windsor Burger, Roulette Peppers and the Kale Caesar.  The burger was delicious (medium rare) and one of the best I've had. It was moist and flavorful; very well done on a soft pretzel style bun.  The sweet potato fries were okay; a bit on the soggy side and I would have preferred some more salt.  The salad was excellent and was not over dressed. The croutons were cheesy and they added avocado and celery which was unique and added something special. The only thing I'd do differently is to slice the celery thinner as it was awkward to get a small enough bite with the other ingredients.   The peppers were also fantastic and were done in some lemon juice olive oil and the right amount of salt.  I'm excited to come back for brunch!

You know how you crave something absolutely disgustingly greasy when you are hungover sometimes? Don't ask me why biscuits and gravy became a hot topic of conversation waking up in bed but it led us to Mark's Cafe.  The place is a tiny family owned restaurant and everyone was very sweet and the service was decent.  As for the food, we ordered Chicken Fried Steak and it was "okay" but nothing special. The potatoes had a rubbery texture like they had been previously frozen. Coffee is standard diner coffee and my poached eggs were cooked perfectly and served in a side dish.  All that I can say is that the staff was very friendly and sweet. Otherwise, you're better off making your own breakfast at home.

I found Serene Dental by accident since I lived literally around the corner. Immediately, I knew I would fall in love with this woman owned and operated dental clinic.   The office is comfortable and inviting and Dr. Hangalay is extremely gentle, knowledgeable and friendly. Griselda, the office manager, is also super sweet and the dental assistant is the most adorable person you will meet!   All this is great in terms of making me feel comfortable but what really sticks out is the way that I do not feel like I am being taken advantage of. I feel like Dr. Hangalay really cares and wants to provide me with only what I need and not to over charge me for extra services that I may not need. In fact, the first visit I had was an out of pocket visit. She cleaned my teeth and filled my cavity at an extremely low price. I remember paying just over a couple hundred dollars (4 years ago).  Currently, I am getting a night guard for my night grinding and I've come back into the office for readjustment due to an uncomfortable fit. She finally took a bite impression and a mold for my bottom jaw in addition to the top she previously did. I am confident that I will eventually get the correct guard for my mouth and prevent the erosion of my enamel and cracking of my teeth. She is doing this all at no cost to me and I feel like she is going above and beyond to ensure that my initial investment is worth it to me and my dental health.  Thanks ladies!

Gross as gross can be you'll never catch me!  - Eating here ever again!!!  Airports are not all notorious for their gourmet, reasonably priced restaurants, but this place made me feel taken advantage of.    As the only place to grab a drink while waiting an hour and a half to board my flight I excitedly headed toward Jackalope Flats.  It's walls are peppered with vintage household items and of course that adorable little jackalope we all know and love.    The menu is pretty basic, chili, salads, nachos, burgers and sandwiches.  I ordered the Turkey Club - Sliced Turkey, Swiss Cheese, Crispy Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato and Spicy Chipotle Honey Mayo on Sourdough Bread - sounds good!  WRONG!  The meat is the worst quality, water pressed "turkey" and the cheese was Swiss American ( a couple sparse holes and little flavor ).  The mayo tasted more sweet than spicy and the bread was so hard it cut the roof of my mouth.  I couldn't even eat the sandwich, it was so horrible.    I guess the beer is the only good thing here because I ordered a mimosa that my server recommended to me.  The champagne was flat and warm.  When I asked the bar if they could remake it since it was flat and showed them the absence of all bubbles he offered to pour some soda water in it to add some "fizz".    Honestly, this place isn't worth the money I'm spending.  If this places wasn't in the airport, there is zero chance it would survive.

Skee Ball, Shuffleboard, Darts, Foosball, board games, etch-a-sketch and a neighborhood feel.  Always a good time at the Little Woody. The cocktails are imaginative and typically the bartenders ensure the pour is nice :)  The only complaint I have about this joint is the overwhelming sulfuric scent emanating from the women's bathroom in the front of the bar.  Not sure if this is like this always but the last few times I've been here it was almost enough to make me ralph.

So, I'm confused. Is this place or is this place NOT the same as Pizzeria Bianco? Same place or no? It seemed like the same place with very similar if not the same items on the menu and a nice fancy but down-to-Earth vibe.   We came in on a stop at the plaza to shop a bit and were kinda excited to see it here!   Pizza at 2 in the afternoon? Why the heck not! So we sat down in the courtyard to enjoy some delightful spring weather and a yummy sausage pizza. We received our warm olives and drinks and just hung out until our food arrived. The edges were very burnt but we just ate around it, wood fire oven, it happens. I do wish that the toppings were cut up a bit more, the sausage was so big that it was kind of awkward to split up the pieces so all had some.   For the price I feel like it wasn't really very flavorful and the crust was a bit too black for my liking. I would much rather spend my money at The Parlor across the street on Camelback.

Matt's Big Breakfast is good. Not like St. Francis good, but like the best diner food without the transients and lard that one would come to expect from traditional breakfast joints.  They mostly local and farm fresh, quality ingredients and although there isn't much variety, they do standard breakfast well.   If you want a fresh American breakfast with freshly squeezed juice, come here. Be prepared for a long wait if you snooze.

It's not that this place is bad, it has a charm that comes with the cool outdoor patio dining area and the open structure with it's hip staff, but the food is meh.  Good coffee (Cartel) and dog friendly.  I've dined here only twice, so maybe I'm missing something.   Chorizo Burrito - pretty darn good. Egg & Bacon Sandwich with Avocado - not bad but the bacon was slimy and hardly cooked at all. Potatoes - these were steamed and flavorless. Lox Bagel - Good but $15 really?  This place is pretty good for brunching with some mimosas at the bar with the bartender dressed like Edward Sharpe. Come chill and kick it with your amigos on the patio and enjoy your drinks during the cool Arizona winter, but don't be expecting to be blown away by the food.

I just had the most amazing acupressure treatment by Kari-Ann! I am 37 weeks pregnant and have been experiencing tightness in my pelvic area. I feel loose and relaxed. I feel rejuvenated similarly to how I feel after an acupuncture treatment but without needles. Her hands are magic people!

I feel really bad leaving this review because the owner was very sweet. My nail tech was named Kaitlyn (I think) and she was also very nice.   I haven't had a proper mani/pedi in years since I've been traveling and was really looking forward to this. I would normally visit Salon D' Shayn but it was later in the evening and this was the closest salon that was open.  The reason why I am leaving this poor review is because I paid close to $56 + tip for my House Pedicure and a manicure - no gel. It was the worst that I've ever had.  Pedicure - The chairs have some weird vibration setting instead of the normal massage chairs most nail salons have (this would not have been that big of a deal if the pedi was good).  The nail tech scrubbed my dry feet with a callous remover (dry) She pushed my dry cuticles back with the end of an emery board and filed my nails down a bit. She did not clean underneath my nail or trim my cuticles. She did correct an ingrown/cracked nail I had on one of my big toes, but otherwise, she just pushed back my dry cuticles.  She then had me put my feet in the water and washed them with sugar scrub and rubbed the scrub into my legs, she did this for less than 1 min each leg. Washed off the scrub and then no lotion - she proceeded to paint my nails. She did have a good idea to use white underneath yellow polish.   Manicure - She did not soak my nails in water before she filed my nails into a square shape and pushed my dry cuticles back with the emery board. She had me soak one hand in the water while she picked the cuticles from the center of the nail bed and not all around the nail. She did put lotion on my hands but no massage.   I added a picture of my dirty nails and here it is three days later and all of my cuticles are peeling back. I would have rather just painted my nails myself.

I have to say that this place really surprised me.   I appreciate that the owner, Barbara, personally reached out to me to get my feedback and to ask for a second chance to make a first impression.  My nail artist was Marissa. She did a fantastic job on my tips and toes.  She was very laid back and sweet. She was thorough and although she had acrylic claw-like nails, she had a nice touch with the mini massage on the feet and hands and didn't scratch me!  I feel like this always happens when getting massaged at other nail salons even when the person has short nails; when the massage begins, they dig their nails into the tender bottom of my foot - not Marissa!  She really did a fantastic job, my nails are perfect and my gel looks great and I left feeling pretty, oh so pretty!  Thank you :)

Lunching with the folks is typically restricted to a few choice restaurants in the valley. They are vegan/vegetarian and prefer Mexican, True Food Kitchen or Pita Jungle. I can't tell you how many times we've dined at Restaurant Mexico, Serrano's etc. In an attempt to sway them toward some Mexican food that is above the mediocre requirements of some of the aforementioned names, we came to La Casa De Juana.   I must say that everyone was pleasantly greeted, our service was prompt and the food was quite good.   Carne Asada Burro Taco Salad w/Carne Asada Guacamole & Chips Tacos (all kinds)  The carne was well prepared and not full of gristle.  Taco salad shell was pretty burnt and dark brown, but everything inside was very fresh and had a nice balance (not overdressed). Guac had a nice flavor and the salsa was tomatillo and very good.  Tacos were done properly and had a good flavor.   Overall everything went well, they have cute glassware and the vibe is very Mexico! Flags, color and art even embedded into the booths. I'd say this is an excellent choice if you want some basic flavorful Mexican. This place is a family owned and operated establishment so I definitely support that!

The search for my go-to Mexican restaurant has finally ended!   4 different kinds of salsa, all flavorful, spicy and not watered down. When you dine in, you get chips and all of these delicious salsas in fancy bowls.  We had the tamale plate with tacos, carne asada and chicken, and a bean & cheese burrito.  All of this was amazing minus the grizzle in the carne. The tamale sauce (red) was phenomenal and the tortillas were all very fresh so the beans didn't spill out of the burrito and the tacos remained intact.   Dinner and lunch plates came with a pineapple and orange slice and shredded lettuce.  Our server, Irma's daughter was super sweet and very friendly.

This place has potential in that it looks cool and is in a great location. The patio is open and modern and they have bike racks and neat planters in front.   There are multiple vendors within this open warehouse type space (all of which close around 8pm) that serve various types of food and one main bar area.   The drinks were actually quite divine, I had The Diplomat and a 1928 (or something like that). Each cocktail was very well balanced and although they were expensive ($50 for 4 drinks) they were good and strong.  We were there for a birthday party and with all of the various vendors closing up, sweeping, taking out trash and just the general drab vibe and strange layout it was to say the least; uninviting.  Kitchens close early so be there before 8:30pm. I've tried appetizers from the burger bar, fries and fried veggies. All decent. The Asian ramen restaurant is good if you like your ramen bland.   Overall, this place is "okay" for the drink quality, but overpriced and lacking in the welcoming vibe department.   I doubt I'll ever pay another visit.
