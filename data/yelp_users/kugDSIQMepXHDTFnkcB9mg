This negative review is for Apple the company not necessarily this store.  We drove all the way to this store to purchase a case for a new ipod touch that was ordered online through Apple.  I spent several hundred dollars on this 64meg engraved product and was excited to give it as a gift, but wanted to protect the device in the event it was dropped.  Here's the kicker.....after a 20 minutes drive to get to the Apple store, I'm told by 2 associates that Apple doesn't even sell protective cases for  THEIR own product!  One wall was a sea of cases for their phones.  Another was a sea of other accessories, BUT no cases for the ipod touch. How could you offer a product for sale that cost so much and then don't even offer cases to your consumers? Unbelievable

I walked in today to order my veggie sub and this young man Garth was behind the counter by himself for a small period of time.....pumping out subs for a long line of people.  He didn't skip a beat, had a smile, polite demeanor and friendliness under pressure, plus he was super cleanly.  Thank you Garth.

I was referred to Four Legged Friends and was amazed on my first visit! The staff was so kind, the atmosphere was great too!  My dog Thor was calm and happy the entire time.  As a matter of fact every other dog I saw there was happy.  Not a common sight in a veterinary clinic. No pressure and maximum efficiency was a plus. Thank you Dr. Ferguson and your staff! Lisa R

I love this place!  Amazing true Italian food.  Try the Mama's Signature Calzone with spinach, tomatoes, garlic & mozzarella.  Add ricotta, artichoke hearts, mushroom, and roasted red peppers!   It's to die for!  If you are Italian or from back east and you miss the good stuff, you will appreciate this place.  They always have fresh ingredients & great service.

This is a cute little mom and pop place.  I w asn't impressed and it isn't anything I would try again.  Thank God For the Hot sauce.  Even then it still wasn't good.  The fish did not taste fresh, and I've never had tuna that tasted fishy.   I think reviews are very important, & I definitely do not like to leave any type of a bad review for a company especially when it is a mom and pop shop. Two stars is pushing it on this one.

I love this target because it's close to home, super clean, and a friendly staff. They have a great variety but it would be nice if it was a Super Target! Having a Starbucks inside is always a plus!

I have been going to this Pei Wei for 4 years and until last year I would say I was happy with their food and service. I am not sure if management or cooks have changed but their quality of food is below par and their take-out orders have been wrong several times. This time they forgot my sushi and my shrimp was battered instead of steamed...again! I am extremely disappointed as this is the 4th time my take out order was wrong and my sweet n sour shrimp tasted like old oil and vinegar. Unfortunately, management is wishy washy too in dealing with these reoccuring problems. Last time I was told I would recieve a gift card in the mail. Never happened. This time I was comped for my soup..I am taking my food back today after one bite and expect a full refund. I will go elsewhere from now on, as 4 times is no charm.

Mario serviced my refrigerator for me this week.  He was amazing.   Not only were they extremely accommodating to the very tight schedule that I have but the friendliness and professionalism was above and beyond what I expected!  What a great staff they have. Right from the initial phone call to scheduling my appointment, to the service being completed this company was excellent! Thank you and I look forward to doing business with you in the future.

Let's face it, we all have our favorite sushi restaurant and we hate to waiver from what we "know".  Trust me, there is green grass on the other side.  This place has an amazing staff and sushi with a flare.  Hayley my server was the best.  Thank you!

I've been to several chiropractors over the years and I have to say this doctor is top notch. Dr. Blankenbaker has an amazing facility offering various types of physical therapy as well as chiropractic care, plus they also have an amazing line of weight management supplements. He and his manager Emily have amazing business ethics, flexible hours and are always accommodating. You definitely aren't just another number when getting care at Spine and Disc! Thank you for making a difference in my daily life!

This is my first time at this location, and it seems like a pretty well staffed and organized store. I especially loved their 50% off Hanukkah sale today.  Not many people around town carry Hanukkah items, so thank you Michaels for recognizing the needs of the Jewish people.  This made my holiday experience so much better and shopping easier.

I've been seeing Dr. Bhallah and his assistant Brady Nelson for a few years now.  If it wasn't for them, the pain I suffer from fibro would be unbearable. Yes at times they are busy, but the staff is always kind.  It would be nice if you weren't on hold for a long time but they do have a patient portal which they respond to quickly.  It can be used for prescription refills, scheduling appointments, billing questions, messages to the doctor....etc. Thank you for your continued efforts to give me the proper care I require.

I have had my share of a Greek food and this is amazing!  Fresh, flavorful and affordable.   If you are in Scottsdale you must check them out.  Indoor and outdoor seating is a plus, and it's not loud inside at all.
