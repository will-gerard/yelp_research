Horrendous customer service and golf course.  I arrived right at the start of the day trying to get a quick round in.  We purchased carts so we could play faster and they made us wait behind everyone that were walking.  We agreed to start at hole 3.  By the time we got to 9, they told us the back 9 was closed so we could only play 9.  We then played 1 and 2, but they sent a cart ranger to ride alongside of us the entire time to ensure we didn't play any longer.  As we were coming back, we saw groups playing hole 10.  The whole staff, from club house to rangers had no service and no class.  I hope none of you reading this ever play this dog track again.

A+++   This was the best and most responsive locksmith call I have ever worked with.   It was pouring rain with lightning,  and Joseph came instantly and got me in within seconds.   He was upfront with me and provided a very good rate for the service.   I will definitely be asking for him when I call in the future,  and would recommend this team to anyone.
