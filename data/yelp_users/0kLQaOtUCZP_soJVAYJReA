Absolutely disgusting! Our family had to check in to this over-priced roach motel because our air conditioner broke last night and this was closest to the house. We were charged $95 after our AAA discount and I wish we had just gone to the Wigwam for that price! The room was left in a disgusting state. I didn't want to touch the sink, as it had not been wiped down prior to our check in. There were stains all around it and on the counter, and a suspicious-looking curly hair by the mirror. *shudders* Seriously, I think I have PTSD from the horrendous conditions. The shower had someone else's hair on the wall, a crack on the floor and both towels looked as though someone had not bothered to wash nor change them. One of the lamps was unusable because someone broke the switch off. (Was Bruce Banner staying here before us and the state of the room just made him really angry?) Then you go outside the room to the parking lot, only to have to dodge puddles of old vomit and overflowing trash bins. Yuck! Then to top it all off, the customer service is sorely lacking. The clerks are apathetic at best. No one asked how our stay was. I guess they knew better than to ask such a loaded question.  If our AC ever breaks down again, we will surely go the extra mileage and stay somewhere else that would be worth nearly $100 a night. This place is a joke that I just don't get.

Oh my goodness, I love love LOVE this place!  They have officially earned my business for life!    I live all the way out in the West Valley.  Many of you who are familiar with this part of town, know that we are sorely lacking in a lovely knit shop all our own.   I was working on my first ever lace project and discovered it was not looking right.  So, the hubby, the baby and I took a trek to another yarn shop closer to us.  When I asked for help at this other store, the lady gave me a hard look, told me she did not have time to help me because she was preparing to teach a class and then asked if I bought the yarn I was working with in her shop!  She further explained that the help would be free if the yarn was purchased from her, and it was $8 otherwise!  Well we drove ALL THE WAY to her just for the help, so I was actually willing to plink down my 8 bucks just to figure out what I was doing wrong!  She maintained she could not help and to come back Thursday.  I left fuming, frustrated and angry.  I have bought yarn from her in the past, but this was NOT the first time she was so rude.  She lost my business that day!  Well, I have been to Tempe Yarn and Fiber in the past while working on a project for my husband (they were the closest yarn shop that had a merino wool/silk blend - the OTHER lady didn't carry wool in the Summer!), and thought I'd give them a call.  The sweetest lady answered the phone and told me that we were a mere hour away from their "drop in help" session with one of their instructors... FREE OF CHARGE to boot!  I popped in, sat at a table filled with the sweetest kindred spirit knitters, who allowed me to jump the queue because me husband and baby were in the car waiting for me (she decided to take a nap just before we got into Tempe).  The instructor was thorough and helpful.  The staff was warm and inviting.  Even though my stash was pretty full, I just bought more yarn to show my support of their business.  They have a loyal customer in me from here on out!

Oh my stars!! Super delish food here. This morning, the hubby and I decided we would go out for breakfast, and since we both have restarted the Paleo diet, we had to make a quick getaway from our first choice: a bakery with some sinful looking pastries and no protein-only dishes. We thought we would have a sad 2nd choice for breakfast with some boring eggs and bacon. So not true! We had been to Park Cafe for lunch once and had some amazing burgers and that was where we hosted our gender reveal party last September, so we thought we'd give them a try for breakfast. Oh boy are we glad we did! We both ordered the South of the Border omelet, omitting the sour cream and cheese topper. It was an explosion of flavor! The seasoned steak and grilled veggies were complimented by both the red and tomatillo sauces. It was amazeballs!! Seriously, my new fave omelet. (A side note: we can't be 100% sure we had no gluten or dairy, since we did not ask what was in the sauces nor how they prepared their omelet batter, but we don't have allergies - we are merely trying to shed some post baby weight.) Our waitress was super sweet and attentive. She even accommodated my request for honey to sweeten my coffee. The manager, Gilbert, really makes his guests feel welcome and he was amazing to work with for our private party. We highly recommend Park Cafe for lunch or breakfast and will be back soon!

This is a quaint little cafe with absolutely scrumptious Sammies and Sweets. We happened to be in the Tempe area and were looking for a place for our family of 4 to have lunch. Being our first time, we were going to order 4 sandwiches to try, but the owner suggested we get two kids croissants for our daughter (aged 3) and son (17 months) to save money and it would be the perfect size for their small appetites. I ordered the Pizza Panini and the Beef Pastrami to split with my husband. The service was a little sluggish, but the staff are so friendly and the food itself was worth the wait! Tried the pizza panini first and the focaccia texture was astounding! Crisp, flakey exterior and an airy, fluffy interior, it was perfectly toasted and paired well with the rich tomato sauce, mozzarella and pepperoni. This one was hands down our favorite between the two. The beef pastrami was good and had a very green, herb-y flavor and with your choice of cheese and veggies, was definitely a hearty sandwich. We ordered their ice blended mocha and salted caramel coffees, and they were just perfect. Sweet, creamy and almost a dessert in themselves! Their flavor was on point!  We ended our meal with a chewy, fudgy brownie topped with vanilla ice cream and, like piranha, we devoted it in seconds! My few notes for improvement would be that the high top pub tables were not the easiest to seat two small kids. One of us had to eat with the little guy on our lap since they didn't offer high chair seating, which makes sense since the tables were too tall for a high chair to meet up to anyhow.  The other critical note is that they do not offer sides with their sandwiches, so if you are super hungry, plan accordingly. Other than that, this is my new fave eatery in Tempe!
