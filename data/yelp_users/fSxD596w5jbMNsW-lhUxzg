This pizza just saved my life!!!  Thanks Zack!  Always a great night a Papago!  Yelp keeps telling me that my review is too short.  But too many words just screws up great beer.  Simply perfect!

I recently had a few scratches put on my new Camaro.  I have only had the car a couple weeks and some unsightly marks on the front from some friends messing around just didn't appeal to me.  I looked around on Yelp for a decent body shop that wouldn't break my pocket!  THANK GOD I went to see these guys!  Jeremy is AMAZING took such good care of me that I will ONLY go see these guys from now on! Trust all these reviews, they are TOP NOTCH.    Don't let the exterior of the place fool you.  They do a lot of business and it kinda looks like you are pulling into a cheap lot, but the SERVICE and CRAFTSMANSHIP are the best!  Thanks Again Guys!  Steve

I've been coming to BS West for over five years now! More importantly I've been there almost every Sunday for the last four years! The bartenders are amazing, sexy, and the one that doesn't wear shirt all the time lets me pinch his nipples and feel up on his giant pecks! Oh yeah, it's also karaoke! Normally when I go to a karaoke bar I am just appalled by the caliber of singers that I encounter. BsWest always seems to have amazing vocalists and Tommy the host always makes sure everyone gets the chance to rock out to their favorite song! Back to that sexy bartender though, I almost melt when he sings "Lightning Crashes", Gives me a giant lady Boner!  drinks are always amazing, the atmosphere is super fun and very laid-back! If you have not been to BS West on a Sunday, I definitely recommend coming to see what all of the hype is about! Occasionally you will find the stunning female and male impersonator's shows usually starting at 6 or 7 PM which make a great transition to the awesome evening that you will for sure encounter!  I hope I will see all of you there soon!

Flying Delta out of Phoenix today.  The desk clerk might have been the most annoying person I've come across all month.  Literally every 4 minutes he got on the overhead with an annoying anecdote about how people need to check their carry on bags. Just make people check them if the plane is full. I don't need to hear about how Santa wants me to be on the nice list. Just get these people on the damn plane.  Boarding has been going on for 30 min on this not very busy airplane!   Ugh!
