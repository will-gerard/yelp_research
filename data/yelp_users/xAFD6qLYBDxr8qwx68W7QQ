I love the Coronado Cafe.  They offer fresh ingredients and a seasonal menu.  The service is phenomenal.  I was but a lonely two top in a sea of large parties, but was paid attention to nonetheless.  My buddy and I made many substitutions and our order came out perfectly; our check was below forty dollars, cocktails included.  I wish I lived closer by because I'd be there every Saturday when I wake up in dire need of eggs and cocktails.

It's difficult to find good bagels in Scottsdale, so my roommate and I ventured to Tempe to satiate our cravings.  We both got the open-faced bagel, cream cheese and lox.  It was excellent and fresh.  The bagel was chewy without being too bread-like.  The lox was fresh and high quality.  I will definitely be back.

What a little gem of a place.  If you are afraid of harsh lighting, stay away from this place.  I'm serious; the lighting is fluorescent and it will enhance every flaw you have.  Don't go here on a first date; just sayin'.  Apart from that, though, this place is really cool.  It's cheap, there are plenty of pool tables, a cute little patio for smokers, and the bartender on weekends (Angela?  Andrea?  Something like that) is pretty awesome.  For whatever reason, there is a twelve inch Urkel doll behind the bar, which is amazing.  They also offer an Irish tequila (?!?!) that's two bucks a shot.  Can't beat that, right?

This place is the worst.  I went around ten on Saturday night and it was packed.  It seems the place is intended to cater to rapey, Nickelback-loving, popped-collar misogynists and the women who love them.    There is no place to sit, no place to talk (because it is LOUD) and zero ambience.  To its credit, though, I was served quickly (because there were like 3000 bartenders) and it wasn't that expensive, but it would take much, much more than that for me to ever return to rape-central again.

Hi, I really like to drink!  Top's is pretty much the best liquor store ever.  They have nice employees and a bitching selection.  I'm pro-any place that is pro-drinking.  They also recognize that ball-point pens don't write very well on hard counters, and they have set up a taped area that allows one to sign a credit card slip in peace.  Top's is tops in my book.

A great place to have a small meal and tie one on.  The service is always attentive and genuine.  I appreciate that they let their servers wear their own clothes, and I think it's cool that the staff is mostly (entirely?) female in such a male-dominated industry.  I'm pissed that they got rid of their Malbec, though.  That shit was tasty!  And they have such a nice patio...but it's non-smoking.  Ew.

They've got PBR!  And organic cucumber vodka!  A rooftop-view and a competent staff.   Everything a downtown patron could ever ask for!  Except it's not the Emerald Lounge.  Not even close.

I was excited for Daily Dose to open because of the lack of breakfast options in oldtown.  I mean, if I want to spend two hours or more having breakfast, I'll go to the Orange Table, if I want flavorless, overpriced options, I'll go to the Breakfast Club, if I want mediocrity and middle America, I'll go to US Egg, if I want still-drunk patrons from Axis-Radius, I'll go to Cafe Carumba, but I digress...  I'd love a good breakfast place, and I was hoping that Daily Dose would deliver.  I loved that they put cucumber slices in the water.  The service was attentive, at first.  I think the place was wildly understaffed, as it later took a turn for the worse.  The food took FOREVER to come, and my dish (some kind of egg sandwich) was waaay over-cooked and sort of disgusting as a result.  The table next to me had an omelet and the eggs looked burned as well.   The side options are confusing (they offer squash as a side in lieu of potatoes, but they call it "hash", like um, hash browns) and the coffee is weak.  Good ingredients, decent menu, but the kitchen needs to step it up and they should either consider more servers or staff the place with more competent people.  I'll probably be back because I have a bad habit of frequenting places I dislike.
