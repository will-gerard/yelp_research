I went there with a group of friends to try their happy hour menu but that was only available at the bar. We didn't really cared about it so we say at one of the tables. I got a guava mojito and the 'big-ass' burger. I thought the guava mojito was very delicious but the burger was not so great. The burger was very dry. I heard great things about this place but the food was just okay. To top it off, the service wAs bad. Our server was an A-hole and he kept on pushing us to order appetizers even though we already said we were going to wait for our friend. Was he thinking that we were not going to get any food??

The food was very fresh and juicy. My fianc√© and I ordered a shrimp salad and a 3 course dinner which was not on the menu. All of the dishes were good but it was not a 'wow' type of dishes. I brought my dog and sat out on the patio, they were very nice and gave him a water bowl.
