My BMW was making a strange noise a few months ago.  Took to Chapman BMW on Camelback and was told my car needed a new radiator, mechatronics sealing sleve, upper strout mounts, etc.  Total quoted was $3200 in "required repairs."  Same day I took my car to Bavarian Motors - told radiator was fine, just leak in hose. Same with sealing sleeve -- no leaking transmission fluid.  Replaced strut mounts and hoses and price was $470 -- a lot better than my $3200 price given to me at Chapman.  This has happened several other times too with Chapman where I was given very high costs for repairs only later to learn items weren't broken or needing service.

I learned several years ago to stop going to Chapman BWM and use German Auto Service.  This place is fantastic and has saved me a great deal of $$$ and aggravation.  Their service techs take the time to go over everything with you and have always been able to answer all of my questions.

I generally like Best Buy and have always had very good luck with them.  I recently moved just a few blocks away from the 20th St and Camelback store -- This has got to be the nastiest and most disorganized Best Buy I have ever been to.   Last week I was there to purchase a tv bracket -- 70% of the items were out of stock.  The next day I went to purchase a simple cable for my phone -- out of stock.  Last night I went to return an item -- no one was in line, however it took close to 20 minutes for someone to come to the customer service desk.  Once she was there, she didn't know how to use the register, then register ran out of paper once she was ready to process my return and took another 10 minutes for her to find a manger to change the receipt paper.  Employees are rude and mostly brain dead at this store.  I'd rather drive 20-30 minutes to Fry's Electronics in Tempe than ever return to this store again. The manager of this store needs to be fired.

Ok has been 7 months since my 1 star rating.  I thought I'd stop in to buy a new camcorder.  BIG MISTAKE.  One guy working in the department while the store manager and other employees talked at the customer service counter about what they watched on TV last night.  After asking 3 times for the camera guy to request some help, I gave up after waiting 40+ minutes.  I have now sworn to never go back to this store.  I have no idea how they even stay in business.

I wish I would have checked this company's Yelp reviews before wasting $200 on a "detail package".  I came in for a simple car wash for my older BWM car.  Service person then suggested he could make my car look "brand new" for $499 and for an extra $100 buff out a few scratches.  I told him I wasn't interested and then he dropped the price to $400, then $300 and then finally $200.  Told me it would take 6 hours with a few of his best employees working on it.  I was in the area 2-3 hours later and stopped by and they had not even started on the car.  When I finally did show up 6 hours later, they were still not finished.  The car did look a bit better but not $200 worth.  Scratches were still there and when I drove away, I noticed dog slobber all over the passenger and back windows.  I do own dogs and knew is was from there, but to pay $200 to have your car "detailed" and to have them forget to even clean the windows is totally unacceptable.  I later checked online and see other local detail places with prices of around $159 for the same service and 4-5 star reviews.  I now know to NEVER go back to to this place again.

I have had too many issues in the past with Discount Tire installing my tires and wheels incorrectly and then not standing behind their work.  A friend recommended this place -- WOW, what a difference and their prices are pretty much the same as Discount Tire - but with professional employees and work.  I have recommended them to a number of friends and they are all happy.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.

I have eaten at this place at least 40-50 times over the past 2-3 years and the place has always been one of my top restaurants in town.  However the last 4 times I have been there, service and quality has really gone downhill.    After last night's dinner experience, I probably won't be going back for some time. Prices have always been on the high side, but I didn't have an issue with that when the quality was good.  However last night dinner came to $148 for 2 people -- with no dessert.  Drinks were small and $14 for an average margarita.   My friend and I each had 2 margaritas.  Dirty dishes and glasses were never removed from the table.  My chicken dish was way over cooked -- almost like rubber.  The dish was served with cold unseasoned steamed zucchini and bland mashed potatoes which looked burned.  My friend ordered a steak medium-well.  It came out almost raw on the inside.  When this was brought to the attention of the server, he never apologized and simply grabbed the plate away and later returned with the meat cooked to something that looked medium-rare.  We didn't feel like complaining again.  During the entire dinner I asked 3 times to the server to have our water glasses filled, but it never happened.  I know some places can have an off night, but again this was the 4th time in a row for poor food and service.  I am sad to say that Barrio Cafe is officially off my list.

Probably one of my favorite places in town to eat.  I have been here 75+ times over the years and have never once had a single bad experience.  Buttermilk Chicken with sweet potatoes is out of this world.

Since I just hit 100 check ins at this restaurant, I felt I should update my review.  This is probably one of my favorite places in town to eat.  I have never had a bad experience.  Always excellent service and excellent food. Buttermilk Chicken with sweet potatoes is out of this world. Also the Jack Daniel's Bread Pudding is to die for.

I made the mistake of going to this branch on a Friday at 4:30 pm. They had 2 teller windows open and I counted 23 people in line, with 4 greeters. I had a simple check deposit and I didn't require a receipt. I asked 2 of the greeters if they could handle the deposit for me, as greeters do at their other branches, but was told I would need to stand in line. I will not make the same mistake twice and won't be returning to this branch.

Probably my worst dining experience ever. Waited over 10 minutes after being seated for waiter to come over. We decided on breakfast buffet -- BIG mistake.  Boring items -- undercooked eggs, cold pan cakes, bacon, sausage, fruit, oatmeal, yogurt parfait and omelets to order.  No bowls were out for the oatmeal -- had to ask 2 different people to get me one. Then discovered were out of oatmeal and were making more. Then no yogurt parfait -- asked to have some more made to the waiter.  Waited over 15 minutes and still nothing.  Waiter then just came to our table and without saying a word, placed the bill for $58 on our table.  Never came to fill our empty water and juice glasses and never apologized for them being out of the oatmeal and parfait. As we were leaving, overheard couple in front saying they too would never return.

Excellent spicy food and excellent service.  I am so excited to have this place now so close to my home.
