Authentic Mexican fast-food chain, WITH cold beer, friendly employees and sustainable, great tasting fish?  YES!!  It's a delight every time I go.  The food is fresh and made to order, the service is always top notch and for me, the commitment to sustainable fishing practices goes a long way.  I recommend Rubio's every time someone from back east comes out to visit.

Hands down the most bland food I've ever had.   Greek Meatballs were room temp, all drinks were accompanied by a sticky glass, and the side salad was basically an onion or two.  The Grilled Chicken Wrap contained overcooked chicken, more balsamic vinegar than I've ever seen and the tiniest sprinkling of feta.  All other parties at the table were disappointed as well.  They had also described the food as bland and we we all felt like we were in the twilight zone with the bizarre  music that was playing.  The manager took $10 off the bill, but that hardly made up for it.
