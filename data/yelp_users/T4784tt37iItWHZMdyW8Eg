I went there for a second quote on tires as mine had blown out. Jason was great. He helped me get a much better price, was very pleasant and the service was great. I ended up bringing my daughters car for a new battery and a check up too.

5 stars for James D.  Came in for take out after driving for 7 hrs, accident/heavy traffic delays, frustrated and James totally just made me laugh, was patient and very pleasant. I'm very glad I walked in to this Dennis. My mood is much better to continue on my road trip. :)

Fajita Salad is amazing!!!! The decor is very well done and the service was good.  Nice area to sit outside watching people go by at the Strip with music playing. Heaters and fan on outside area.

Dive thru has gotten my order wrong a few times. There is one female staff that's always grumpy when taking ur order inside. Definitely not impressed.

Dr Macri is very knowledgeable and has been treating my back problems for a few months now. My back pain is much more manageable since I've been going to see her. I've been getting acupuncture as well there for my difficulties falling asleep. I'm quite impressed with that, as I did not think it was going to help much but I've been sleeping much better.  I definitely recommend this business.  Professional environment and pleasant staff.

Excellent service. The food was very good. The best apple pie I've had in a long time. The fajitas Appetizer was a good portion, carne assada cooked just right. I really enjoyed both times I've gone there.

Casual place, greeted with a smile as I walked in. The girl on the counter was very pleasant and answered all questions I had on the menu. She brought the food to us at our table with a smile.  I had the gyro sandwich which was delicious :) a lot of meat in it and the sauce was very tasty.  I will be returning to try their other items ( salads, soups, kabobs, and other sandwiches)

My first time here. We had the grilled chicken sandwich and the cheeseburger.  They were both juicy and tender. The waitress was very pleasant. Lots of TVs. I will definitely come back.

Always greeted well here. Love their fish tacos but I ask on flour tortillas; they usually come on corn tortillas. The tilapia, chicken and shrimp tacos are also good. Tilapia taco has a slight spicy sauce.  They have inside and outside seating.  This is my favorite location as the staff is very friendly.

I was very insulted by the girl behind the counter when I brought back a pair of scrub pants I wanted to exchange for a size bigger.   I lost some weight and purchased a smaller size pants. When I got home I tried it on with my  scrub top to see if they matched and noticed the pants felt a bit too tight.   I took it back to the store a few days later to exchange to a size bigger and the lady at the counter told me the pants were wrinkled and u had wire it and couldn't return. I explained I tried it at home for about 5 minutes and realized it was a bit tight.   She would not let me exchange it (I did not have my receipt but the tags were on) and I left the store feeling very insulted for something I didn't do.  I will never go back to this store and a few of my friends go else where now since I told them what happened.

Got seated within 3 minutes on a Wednesday night pie night. That's pretty good especially with all the snowbirds in town. Waitress Joanne greeted my daughter and I with a smile and was very courteous. She checked on us often and was back to ask which free pie we would like with a smile again. I could see she was very busy with other tables but took her time to come back often. The manager stopped by and asked how our food tasted which was nice.  I mostly order breakfast here.  My omelette with pancake and hash brown tasted very good and so did the VIB meal my daughter ordered.  I definitely give  5 gold stars for the waitress Joanne tonight!!!!!!

I've tried the pizza, pasta and sandwiches. I have dine in, to go and delivery. This place is family owned and the food is tasty with flavor. The service has always been good every time; friendly, polite, knew about the menu items, checked on our table often and always pleasant. I definitely continue to come back here.

I've been coming here since they open and love the original AÃ§ai bowl. It's refreshing and the honey drizzle over the fruit and granola makes it just the perfect sweetness.  Sometimes I have it with oatmeal on the bottom and it really feels me up. I wish they were open on Sunday's too.

I would give zero stars if that were an option. I have had multiple malfunction with the sliding door device that set the alarm off and police showed up at my house. I received a fine from the city every time ( since u used their services for malfunction)and Vivint won't pay for it.  For the first 6 months they were charging my account( which u r obligated to have automatic payments) more than the contract rate. I have to call their billing department multiple times and every time they said they fixed the problem but I would still be charged more. This occurred for 6 months.  The window brake unit was malfunctioning and while they were over to fix it the police showed up because the tech didn't put the system on test mode. Again I got stuck with another $100 fine from the city that they didn't pay.  I don't turn on the alarm system anymore since something always malfunction and I get charged $100 from the city. I'm paying for something that does not work.  After all this I still have to wait 2 more years for the contract to be done. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY

Amazing food for being a bar. I go there with my kids for lunch and we have tried almost the entire menu. Karaoke us s lot of fun on the weekend there as well. Staff smiles when serving you and seem to like to work there. Lots of TVs. This is my first pick to watch sports events since there's not a bad seat with so many TVs around.  Nov/2015 Continue to enjoy this place. Took a friend that had never been there before. The food again was very tasty; fish tacos, boneless wings, tilapia. The waitress was attentive and checked in us often despite being very busy. They had a vendor raffling football jerseys and a bike. I won a jersey which made my experience even better.

Been here a couple times. Both times was greeted with a smile. Staff was friendly and explained about the menu and different choices. Kind of like a Subway where u choose what to put inside the pita. Food was actually very good. Definitely one of my places to go eat at.
