I had the cordon bleu burger and it was delicious.... as was the bread pudding. My partner had the fennel and sausage pizza and it was also delicious. I love the atmosphere of the building & how dog friendly it was. I'm definitely a fan and can't wait to go back.

I have been hearing about Barrio Cafe for a few years now, but had never made it down to try for myself. I seriously question my life choices that I had not been graced with that food earlier in my life.  We ordered Queso Fundido to start. I am somewhat of a queso fundido expert, ordering it every chance I get, but let me tell you, this one blew all the other ones I've had out of the water! The sauce was creamy and smooth, the additional ingredients were thoughtful and full of flavor; the chorizo added the perfect compliment of earthiness and savory to cut through some of the richness. Superb. I'd go back just for that. My partner got the Enchiladas Suizas, which I've also had at numerous places (being quite a popular dish in Tucson, where I'm from) and again; these were in a class of their own. The tomatillo cream sauce was heavenly, the grilled chicken's char was a lovely addition. Delicious I ordered the Pollo Poblano. I didn't know what to expect but man; I have no words. The chicken was crispy and juicy, the poblano sauce has the right amount of heat and sweet, the veggies were cooked perfectly (a bit soft, like my Nana would make), the potatoes had a crispy edge and the rest smooth and buttery. Perfection.  I've eaten a lot in my years here in Phoenix, and lord does it show; but I will say that, without a shadow of a doubt, this was the best food I've had in the area. A bit pricey, but so worth it.

As Yelp says, "Meh. I've experienced better." I was expecting some bomb Mexican food based on the yelp reviews I've seen, but dang!  I know authentic Mexican. I grew up eating it & can make it myself, and this was completely subpar. I've pretty much lost faith in Mexican food in the Phoenix area. :(. The cleanliness of the service was questionable. (Maybe invest in multiple spoons for serving meats. I'd hate to have a pork allergy flare up after having you grab my carne asada [beef] with the spoon in the pork container). The food itself was just meh... Very little flavor and no sass. I'm disappointed. :(

It's few times in [my] life that you/I find a breakfast place that is just in one word: everything. The decor is cute as fuck, the food was amazing & we got 3 complimentary snacks and a dessert. The service was stellar, the food was.... Phenomenal. I will definitely come back. My boyfriend and I are on this mission to try as many new restaurants as we can in 2015, & this place is the first I've been absolutely enamored with. I will DEFINITELY be coming back super soon!

We were looking for something sweet after a meal of heavy carbs and decided to try melt. The portion sizes were good, not stingy for the price, and the ice cream flavors were unique, which I appreciated. I tend to prefer ice cream that has more of the crystal formation, which this did not have (complete personal preference), but it was creamy and delicious. I tried the Trix ice cream, which was an 8/10. The ice cream tasted like cereal milk, which I'm always down for, but the pieces of cereal were this weird amount of encapsulated soggy, which I wasn't a fan of. I'd have omitted the cereal and let the flavor of the ice cream stand for itself. I got a second flavor, but I can't remember what it was; so I'm guessing it wasn't that memorable?

Only come here if you want cold food with nowhere to sit. 45 minute wait for a freaking milkshake

I've had my share of really good, slap your nana good Mexican food. This wasn't it. Granted, I only had a fried ice cream and horchata, but the chips and salsa lacked flavor and the icecream was far overpriced for what you got. The whole reason I'm actually writing a review, however, isn't because of the flavor of the food, but rather the atrocious service we received. First off, when we walked in, we didn't know that it was essentially an open seating, so we stood at the cashier looking like schmucks. It took about 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge us, and we still were never greeted. Our server was the cherry on the pie. Took 10 minutes to get us our drink (order) & once he realized we were only getting dessert, he quickly turned rude & short with us. I get that as a server you are working for tips, so a smaller bill would be less important, but you never know how much you could actually get from someone.  Suffice to say, I don't plan on going back, at least (for damn sure) not to this location.

I LOVE Fired Pie. The food was excellent, completely customizable (which I'm obsessed with) and the ingredients are well cooked. DEF recommend!

For the price and for the flavor I give them a thumbs down. Flavor isn't what I expected, & the spring rolls at Costco are even better. I don't think I'd be back.

Delicious Tikka Masala. Super friendly service. Reasonable price. Only gripe:  not enough rice.  I'd definitely recommend!
