Stayed here because I was in town for a wedding. Hadn't stayed here in years. It could use some updating but the rooms are still nice and comfy. But, the staff are what make this hotel awesome. Everyone was so nice. They know your name and take care of your every need. The location is also great. You can walk anywhere you need to go. I've always hated the entrance to the hotel but again, this is where the wonderful staff make this hotel with a strange entrance a great experience.   Parking is $15 a day. Valet parking is $22 a day.   Also know that it's location is great for eating and hanging out. The epicenter along with many other places are close by. One thing you must remember when staying here, it is uptown so it can be very noisy outside and you will hear it in your room.

The food was good and the waitress was nice. But this restaurant was not clean. We were the first and only people in the restaurant on a Saturday morning and the tables were nasty. The floors had trash all over them. There was dust around the windows and possible old ketchup. I won't come back to this location. The one on east blvd is much cleaner.

The customer service was terrible. I flew from Dallas and we had a layover. Some woman working at the counter name Jessica M was horrible. Her attitude was so nasty. She tried to charge me $270 because of an error another person at US Air made.  Needless to say, I didn't pay it and I got on my flight.   I just can't believe the customer service here. I will avoid US Air from now on because I just can't do poor customer service when I'm spending my hard earned money. There is too much competition out there to deal with that.
