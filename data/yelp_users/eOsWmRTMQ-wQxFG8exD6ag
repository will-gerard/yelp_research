Eddie is great!!! He resized two of my watches as I waited, only $10 and ever took the time to polish and shine them up. Took less than 20 minutes. Remember, it's cash only. Great service!

Accidentally bough this groupon in my sleep (sleep shopping issss such a problem ) but so glad I did! Got a great, very technical asymmetrical bob with an undercut that two other stylist in the valley had screwed up. Callie got the job done in under an hour---she's new to the salon but very sweet and super experience clearly. Will be back to see her for sure!

This place is amazing!!! You'd never known it from the outside---it's a little hole in the wall on Calle 16 right in the middle of Mexican mercados y paleterias. It's tiny so expect at least a 30 minute wait at peak hours. They have a serve yourself salsa bar with some of the most unique salsas I have ever tasted---from strawberry to pecan to habanero. The menu is not your typical Mexican food but there isn't a single bad thing on it. Don't bother with rice and beans on the side-- not needed. Try the mole quesa-- its my absolute favorite. The horchata is a family recipe with fruit and pecans in it and its amazingggg and a great big size option. You won't be disappointed in this incredible spot.

Jen is wonderful! As a crazy cat mom, she makes me feel totally at ease. My kitties love her and she sends me daily photo updates and notices unique traits of my critters. Jen takes exceptional care of my kitties and I swear the house is cleaner when I come home than when I left it. She is responsive and provides excellent service at a great rate. She is an absolute professional and we will be using her again and again in the future!

I use to love this place but the last few times the customer service has been the worst. Just tonight, we walked in at least 15 minutes before closing and there was a line if people waiting for ice cream. Randomly, the lady walks out and says "we're not taking any more orders" after we've been waiting for 5 minutes looking at a menu. She was so rude, not even a sorry...I can take my money elsewhere! We walked out and it wasn't even their closing time yet. Rude rude rude and poor customer service all around. Serve the people standing in line, close the door at closing time.

I come from a fitness background and spent the year before joining Crossfit DTP with a personal trainer 4 days a week. After just one open workwork with Crossfit DTP on a Saturday morning, I was completely hooked. Not just on Crossfit, but on this particular gym. The Coaches, Tom and Aly, are some of the most supportive I've met in the industry and come with a wealth of knowledge and infinite patience in training everyone from beginners to advanced atheletes.They make you feel welcomed and comfortable, even if crossfit is way out of your comfort zone.  This is not your average crossfit gym. This is a place you can come every single day and work on your fitness goals, whatever they may be. DTP offers crossfit workouts as well as customized work out options and nutritional counseling. I think that the monthly membership price is very fair and certainly comparable to most other boxes in the area. You get so so much more for your money though.  If the price and the expert coaching isn't good enough reason to give DTP a try, the community within the box certainly is. While the skill level varies greatly, everyone is super down to earth and friendly. Everyone offers encouraging words and high fives, everyone is there through your best workouts and the ones you struggle though. Whatever your skill level is, you can come to DTP and get an awesome work out. I love that I feel safe enough to push myself to do things I didn't think I could do athletically ever before.  Crossfit DTP offers an environment for anyone looking to better themselves. Tom and Aly are excellent coaches who focus on doing things the RIGHT way, instead of just doing them any old way. This prevents many of the typical crossfit injuries you hear so much about. I trust these coaches to guide me and push me. I couldn't ask for a better staff.   If you're looking for a challenge in a supportive arena, come play with us on a Saturday morning at 9am. I promise it won't take long to get hooked. :)

This is one of our go to spots for a quick dinner during the week. Nino is super cool and usually there cooking. The young lady at the cashier is always so cute, bubbly and friendly. Try the Greek salad with chicken or the gyro platter. The spanakopita is also AMAZING and yummy. The portions are very generous and usually have plenty of leftovers. Just be sure to check your to go orders before you go for accuracy--we had a couple times where we had some forgotten parts of our meal but I believe that was due to newer staff members-- we haven't had an really recent issues.

I was so impressed with this office. From the decor to the technology to Dr. Lasee to my "personal shopper" Sydonna--everything was top notch. They got me in same day for an appointment. Dr. Lasee was gentle, knowledgable and so funny! She is the first doctor to change my contact lense type in like a decade or more! Very impressed overall-- I will be back to buy my dream Prada glasses! Highly recommended to anyone with VSP insurance as well.

This is a wonderful and quaint neighborhood restaurant. My husband and I dined several times here since it opened and have been nothing but impressed by the friendly staff and great menu recommendations! The vegetarian combo platter is HUGE and delicious. Perfect way to sample a variety of flavor. We have also tried several of the meat dishes and all were delicious and so flavorful. The injera is freshly made and wonderful as well. We come home with a heap of leftovers every time! This place is so welcomed to our neighborhood--I encourage everyone to try it out!
