Although I do love this place, I guess I can understand some of the "condescending" remarks. If you are looking for a homey, down-to-earth place, this probably isn't it. I love it here - does that make me a snob? Perhaps. Oh well. The food is delicious. My first meal was the simple chicken which is usually a shoe-in for boring and it was not. Juicy, flavorful, perfectly paired with the suggested wine. The next couple times I opted for cheese platters with the wines (again) suggested by server. Yes, our server informed us which wine would go best and why we were wrong with our first choice, and that's fine. Worked out great - and we became educated! Nonstop James Bond movies are pretty cool too. If you're not a Bond fan, look away, and get over it. Cutie waiters might be a good place to look. Trendy "downtown" atmosphere with delicious cheeses and wines galore. Do it.

Says it's Kosher, but apparently only sometimes.   I Googled "kosher bakery phoenix" and Karsh's popped up. So I made the visit to the shop, preparing to find something suitable for passover. I arrived and was met at the door by the sign, "Sorry. Our products are not suitable for passover. Everything is made with flour, bla bla bla" I'm paraphrasing. So I went inside, wondering if it was an April Fool's joke. Although the store was COMPLETELY empty, I mean, barren of all lifeforms, the surly girl behind the counter took her time asking if she could help me. Our exchange proved that it was no joke. They could not help me. No yummy kosher flourless chocolate cake would be in my immediate future. They were kosher - just not for Passover. Lovely. I should've Googled "kosher bakery Scottsdale."

This review is for the historical tour only (they also offer a tour-and-lunch deal, we did the tour alone). The Sunday brunch deserves its own review and is another 5-star in my opinion, if anyone is interested.   To begin, our group of four, averaging age 50, were the youngest whipper snappers in the bunch, by a decade at least.  Which is fine, in this setting, a reserved older crowd was just lovely!  The mansion (or, as we learned, the "winter cottage") is a marvel and just beautiful to behold and to discover all the hidden gems within. But the high points really were brought to our attention by the knowledgeable and personable tour guide, who I assumed has a background in history and/or anthropology. I really don't know, unfortunately, I didn't ask but she was terrific!  Tour patrons are allowed to take any photos they want and I'll attach a few here. A great experience if you are interested in local history, or even moderately curious, and the views from the mansion truly can't be beat.

Insanely good food paired with top-notch service, ambiance and the loveliest hostess! Sima, Marcellino and the entire staff make this restaurant our favorite location for special occasions. Homemade everything - the pasta is always a favorite for us. We had our wedding dinner here, 5 years ago, with a small group of family and close friends and it was wonderful. Amazing servers really know their business and can recommend wine pairings and their favorite dishes.   The new location in Old Town Scottsdale is more convenient to where we live, though we were just as happy to drive a bit further to the original location. I've chosen "dressy" and "not" good for kids, only based on how we like to experience Marcellino's, though they are so welcoming and comfortable I'm sure casual dress and (well behaved!) kids would be just as welcome... if you tend to spoil your kids, that is.

Honest, straightforward, great workers! These are not usually adjectives to describe most repair services, but it describes Reliance. Thank you Dalen for the great service you provided. Two years ago another company suggested we needed to buy a new unit and you saved the day. It's still going strong two years later (a 15 year old unit) and your honesty and great service are much appreciated.

Three words: Sweet. Potato. Fries. Burgers are amazing also, but I'm not a big beefy fan. Hubby is though, and he can't shut up about this place. I'll admit, the cute shopping cart in which the fries arrive is adorable. Yes, that's important. But if the fries weren't to-die-for, it wouldn't matter as much. But they are! Atmosphere is cool/trendy/fun - but not pretentious. Chef Matt is super cool - Hi Matt! :)   I've only been once, so maybe we'll move up to 5 stars after further visits. I believe it was a Friday afternoon, and it was packed. Word is out and they are busy for a reason, so plan on patience or plan accordingly for your visit here. But do visit! It's worth it.

Decent food, family type restaurant. Dining room is jam-packed - a bit snug, elbow to elbow. Meal was fine but nothing to rave about; server seemed very nice but just awful. Very slow and inattentive. Not sure why this place is super popular when it's only so-so.

My husband and I are regulars at Phil's so we are always treated with spectacular service (except for that one waitress...) We heart Rachel! She's an awesome server. When Nate is working in the bar he always takes great care of us, but all the bartenders pour lovely drinks and aren't shy about tipping the bottle. And they know what we drink.   We both tend to stick to our favorites - for me it's the Sonoran Chicken and Pasta. It's quite delicious with a generous portion. And hubby loves pretty much any of the chicken wraps, with a side of the delicious corn chowder.   They have some decent happy hour specials if the dollars are what's keeping you away. It's worth stopping in!   Thanks to Nate and the crew, we continue to frequent Phil's. We kind of feel like everyone knows our name. And how can we not when our regular drinks are poured before we even sit down.

This update is only because our favorite servers / bartenders have changed. Scotty is a top-notch server, as is the lovely Sam! "Salt n pepper Scott" rocks behind the bar, as does our beloved Scotty, for that matter - like Manhattans? Ask for Scotty! I do wish the menu would change a bit, but we come here so often, the lack of variety is kind of our own fault. Scotty DOES know!

Had a lovely ladies lunch here. Was a crazy hot mid-summer day, only available seating was outside. (yikes!) We were expecting 2 of our ladies with small children and this would not fly. After being notified that it would be a 30 minute wait, we were about to go elsewhere and the waiter told us to sit tight and they were cleaning off a table for us, that was just leaving. Very nice!   Prices are about what you'd expect for DC Ranch so I can't complain. Food was fresh, light, good. Had a yummy salad. Everyone in my group loved their food and 2 are big complainers, so I guess that says a lot!   I did not partake, but my companions had some sort of champagne/mango treat that they raved over. Looked scrumptious too!

I was pleasantly surprised at this sports bar. Not your typical bar-food menu - though plenty of those staples as well. The menu was a bit longer than most sports bar type establishments, and varied. I had the grilled shrimp w/ rice and broccoli which sounds incredibly boring and possibly bland - it was neither. Grilled shrimp can easily come out dry and/or rubbery and this dish was tender, flavorful and the rice was flavored with a cilantro lime sauce. So yummy! My husband had Buffalo chicken sandwich that he ooohed and aahed over, so I guess he loved it.   I was pleased to be able to get a decent wine by the glass! They also offer many specialty cocktails in addition to beer (of course).   Spacious, modern decor. Lots of big booths, plenty of seating and many large TVs for those of you specifically looking for a place to watch the game.   Also, the server was a new trainee who clearly had worked in restaurants before because she displayed absolutely no "Newness" and her trainer was helpful and attentive as well.

I was excited that (yet) another restaurant opened in this location. It's convenient and a beautiful spot, yet it seems to have an invisible revolving door, so you never know what will be there from month to month (or so it seems).   Since West Addison is so new, I have to give a lot of leniency for working out the kinks. It's inevitable and forgivable. That being said, I promise to return and give them a second shot down the road... if they are still open.  I agree with most of the kid-related comments below. What are you? Bar or family restaurant? Even if you are a family restaurant, come on people, wrangle your offspring. Our generation was not brought up that way. If we were lucky enough to be taken out to eat, we were expected to behave properly. So true, Nick S., this is not Chuck E Cheese.   But I digress. As of this writing, the restaurant is just OK. The food was fine. The wine was over-priced, tiny pours (though I do like the stemless glasses), and the waitress had zero ZERO! personality. We observed some of the other servers around us and they all were personable, friendly, helpful... we were jealous. Ours sucked. I don't remember her name but she had short blonde hair and never smiled once. Not once.    The environment is super loud. Perhaps because of the low-ceiling area in the back, where we sat. (Up front has high, vaulted ceilings.) Perhaps because of the drunken cougars at the next table. Or because of the maniacal children running around, screaming. Hard to say. If I give this place another shot, I'll bring a jacket (it was chilly that night) and sit on the patio. Less rugrats, cooler, quieter. And the nice waitress was working the patio!

Amazing French macarons! Such lovely cupcakes lined up in the cases, I wanted one of each! Will have to add to review after I've had a cupcake. For now, I will certainly return for the macarons!

Really disappointed in this place. Thought it was a cool local place with yummy burgers but really just a health scare with very poor service (unless you sit at the bar - the bartenders are always great service). The table servers we've had were slow, unapologetic and surly. And the food was just not worth it. I like a spot of grease when I'm craving it, but the food was overly greasy-fried, and the burger buns were dry. Not very tasty. If you want to have a junk food splurge, I can think of dozens of places where I'd line up first. Each time I've eaten there, I've left feeling nauseated. I've given Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers a 2nd and even 3rd chance because it's right near my house and my hubby seems to like it, but today broke me: they just posted something on Facebook that involved not only one of their greasy little burgers but topped with bacon and egg... with a side of doughnut. I kid you not! There's a photo!

Absolutely my favorite "in-town" place to stay (we're from Scottsdale). Stylish, comfortable, perfect downtown location, insanely friendly and helpful staff. Gorgeous room and amenities. Daily wine hour. Free gym next door. Pet friendly! Youuuuge walk-in tub/shower in the upgraded room. Can't say enough. It's my birthday weekend and they greeted me 1) knowing it, 2) with kind greetings, and 3) a nice card and "raid the bar" $10 card. Love this place.
