I am not a "cyclist," I am just a bike rider.  I became obsessed with Electra Townies after riding one.  I am a nerdy, middle-aged mom who just wanted a fun bike to ride with my kid.  I don't know from mountain bikes or road bikes.  After calling all over town and looking on the internet, a friend told me about Slippery Pig and how nice and helpful they were.  I called and they had my dream bike in stock, and at more than $100 less than I'd been able to find on the 'net.  When I went in to see the bike, the little store was packed with hard-core cycling enthusiasts, talking about races and the virtues of various bike parts I had never heard of.  The lone guy running the store was courteous and took his time with each customer.  Did I mention I know nothing about bikes?  Sometimes I hate going into specialty shops because the "experts" there are just socially maladjusted snobs with their little corner of knowledge, and they lord that over you to assert their superiority.  I was a little nervous, because the Pig was definitely a "real" bike shop.  But when it was my turn for assistance, my man Eli was nothing but nice.  Maybe the nicest guy ever.  Even though it was past closing, he took his time going over the bike, gave me a beverage, offered me a discount, told me about the three free tune-ups I get for the next year, and gave me 20% off all accessories (because you know you have to trick out the new bike).  When I went back a week later to get my basket attached, again at closing time, he remembered my name and seemed genuinely interested in what I thought of my bike.  George attached my basket, and I agree with the previous reviewer: he's great, too.  I went in again last night to get a flat fixed, and this latest experience prompted me to write this review.  Again, I rolled in minutes to closing, and they fixed my flat right away, staying until well after closing.  But while I waited, Eli offered me my choice of delicious microbrews (!) and I sipped a lovely Four Peaks Kiltlifter Scottish Ale while they fixed my flat and attached a new saddle!  Where does that happen anymore?  For context, I had taken my daughter's bike in to another LBS a year ago, and they took two days to fix the flat.  They were also nice guys, but two days to fix a flat?  (And no beer.  I think I am going to make free beer a prerequisite for service providers from now on.)  These guys are just the best, and reminded me why it is almost always worth it to seek out small, independent businesses.  Thanks, Slippery Pig!

Believe the hype.    I was skeptical, but it's true: after a week, the haircut and color Amina gave me at Ide Mania looks and feels incredible.  I am a bit of a salon whore.  For the last year or so, I've been playing the field, looking for "the one," and I think I am ready for a committed relationship.  Don't get me wrong, I liked all my previous stylists, but if I am paying more than 60 a haircut, I don't want lectures about all the things I (and my previous hairdresser) am doing wrong, constant product sales pitches, and strained conversation.  It's really the reason I don't go to the salon as often as I should.  I feel like I am being held captive.  Amina was refreshing.  She was so smart and fun to talk to that I am actually looking forward to my next visit.  And although it is true that she is expensive, I would rather pay more for a great haircut and just go a little less often.  And it is so worth it not to have to endure the constant badgering about what products I use and how whatever products they are hawking at the front desk are so much better.  Thanks for the tip, yelpsters!

Noah cut and colored my hair last night on very short notice. I think I love him.  Pure excellence, from his warm, welcoming demeanor to his conversational eloquence; he made me feel like he was there FOR ME. Oh yeah, and my hair? Fabulous.  The best stylists listen to you, then tell you what they think. It's a collaborative effort, and I like someone who has knowledge and opinions and vision.  I usually dread going to spend a couple of hours in a stylist's chair, but with Noah it was a treat.

So not good.    Most things were substandard.  My potato soup with chorizo was delicious.  But other than that, so off the mark.  For instance, my salad was swimming in vinaigrette.  So sour!  That's a Denny's mistake.  My crab fried rice had decent pieces of snow crab, but a strange, off-putting tang that lingered.  When I factor in prices, I start feeling anger and regret over my dinner choice.  Service started off slow (on a slow night), and then ended up downright dismissive.  Elements does have a beautiful view, and I would whole-heartedly recommend it for drinks with out-of-towners.  But if you care at all about food, keep going.

Much respect to Copper Star Coffee.  I am almost always in my p.j.s when I am driving my sweet ,second-grade scholars to school, and I am always jonesing for some good powerful cafe.  But I can't really get out of the car.  I like the cofee brought out to me presto! by some of the most laid-back, friendly people.  Drive through coffee is so American.     Any a sort of bagel/breakfast sandwich situation will cost you, about 15 minutes of your life.  Good and hearty.  The car hops are so wonderful.  They make procuring coffee (the most daunting task in my pre-coffee morning ritual) sort of pleasant.  I don't know anything about the Wi-Fi or the pastries, though.

Unlike some other Yelpers who expressed their reservations at the spare, communist-style decor, I immediately knew this to be a good sign.  Every great, modestly-priced Chinese restaurant I have been to in NYC and San Francisco had similarly sparse regard to "flair."  I found the dearth of tchotchkes and laquered dragons to be reassuring.  These people are about the food.  Best chow fun I have ever had.  Rendolent with that slightly smoky wok-fired flavor, with rich bits of beef, chicken and shrimp.  The broccoli and bok choy were firm and tasty, and there were nice little pieces of fresh ginger.  Also deserving mention are the Mongolian chicken and the beef with grean beans, all with that special wok-seared flavor.  The roast duck was densely-flavored, crispy-skinned with a delicious fatty finish, just like duck should be.  We got take-out, and were shocked by the sheer volume of the food.  Their portion sizes were generous enough to provide leftovers for two more days, and the owner threw in a giant container of egg rolls.  On it was written: "FREE! Thank you very much."  What a sweet, customer-loving touch!

I wanted to love PastaBAR, as I love all of it's selling points (downtown, late night, fresh local ingedients, small plates).  But I didn't.  In a word: underwhelming.  The portions are elegant.  The prices would be perfectly fair if the food rocked.  But everything seemed underseasoned, stark and lacked depth of flavor.  There is simple food, which I dig, but this seemed austere.  I will go back and sample other dishes: I need this place!

Best movers I ever worked with.  There is nothing I dread more than moving, but these guys actually made both of my moves (one an office, and one an apartment) easy.  The owner is as professional as they come, the movers are courteous and good-natured, and both moves were stress-free.
