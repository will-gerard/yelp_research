A year before we married, my husband and I had the distinct pleasure of visiting with Mary Lou a few months before her death in 2010.  We toured her lovely castle and had distinct images of her life as a child on the stone floors, looking at the stone walls, covered with eclectic mis-matched pieces of her life.  I admired her for the child like wonder that was still in her eyes.  Unfortunately, 3 years later when we took my son to the castle, he couldn't meet this wondrous soul for himself.  I highly recommend making this a "must see" stop if you are ever in the area.  It is an artist's play land and being a poet, I could find the beautiful imagery in every nook and cranny.  I look forward to going back again some day soon!

This place is always packed!!!!  The food is absolutely delicious and the service is second to none.  The atmosphere is very cozy and they also have outside seating.  I always get the Eggs Benedict here and it is by far my favorite.  We used to live right down the street, so it was an easy walk for breakfast!

I will be a lifelong customer of this business.  They took a very negative experience from the Gilbert location, corrected it, and made me feel like a valued friend in the process.  Don knows the true meaning of customer service and creates interpersonal relationships with every person that walks through the door.  It doesn't matter how busy he is, he will take the time to address you and recognize that you are valuable to him as well.

We celebrated both our 2nd and 5th Anniversary onboard the Dolly for a twilight dinner cruise.  The experience is absolutely magical and Jeff, the Captain, makes every memory so special.  All the team members are so polite and you can tell that they love what they do.  The food is 5 star, and the drink prices are very reasonable.  We will go back again and again.

This is our favorite "lunch date" place!  My husband and I love to stop in and indulge in their food whenever we are in the area.  The choices are just as good as sit down Mexican, and far better than the average take out place.  (The only thing missing is the wheelchair back to the car after such indulgence!)  It is extremely affordable too!  This particular location is in a nice area, very clean, and the employees are polite!  We have also been to the location on Alma School further north, but much rather prefer this one.

My husband and I had a breakfast date here and loved every second of it.  The place was very busy, but someone was waiting to show us a table immediately.  I ordered the traditional Eggs Benedict and they were cooked to perfection for me.  I ate every bite!  My husband ordered Eggs over medium and they came over easy, too runny for his liking.  He also had the biscuits and gravy which were delicious.  The plates were full and the food was fabulous.  We will go back!

I will give my honest opinion, as I always do.  I came here on the recommendation of my SIL as she said they had in house financing for repairs.  I now regret that decision, but my hands were tied at the time.  My first impression was most excellent as Liz, the district manager was in the store, so everyone was on their best behavior.  I was treated with utmost respect that day.  This was all between March 26-29, 2015.  The AC issue on my car was diagnosed and I had them check the oil leak as well.  They diagnosed an additional Power Steering leak.  I was quoted a specific dollar amount and decided to have the AC and PS repaired.  I contacted the lender they suggested for the repairs and got approved, so I made an appointment to come back first thing in the morning 2 days later, stating that I had to have my car back by the end of that day.  I figured that if they had the entire day that would be just fine.  How wrong I was!!    During the day of the repairs I was called with various different dollar amounts for the PS fix that were several hundred dollars more than originally quoted, so I declined those repairs.  I went to pick up my car that Friday night and it wasn't done.  Needless to say, I was not a happy camper.  Ricardo didn't know if it would be ready the following day or Monday.     The team at AAMCO had ALL day from open to close to complete ONE job.  They knew the job needed to be completed in that time period, as Liz reminded them on Wednesday while I was there for the diagnoses.  After not hearing anything from Ricardo for several hours on the day of the repairs, I called at 3:40 to see if my car was done, he said no, but that it was CLOSE and he would call when it was on the floor.    I got there just before 5 and it still was not ready.  Apparently a wrong part was the culprit, a part that they only opened at 3:30, mind you, this is BEFORE I called.  That means that Ricardo knew when I called that my car wouldn't be ready Friday at all.  I really hate being lied to.  Regardless of the intent, waiting for a miracle of the part to make it on the day of the repairs, or knowingly holding off the inevitable, that is not good customer service.  I have been in the Customer Service field my entire adult life.    When you order parts for a specific job, especially a job that you know must be completed on the same day, isn't it simple common sense to make sure that you have the RIGHT product immediately after receipt?  If that had been done, my opinion might have been a little better.  I don't know when the facility actually received the part, but I am assuming it was the day prior, since Liz stated that she was ordering it herself on Thursday.  Ricardo's "reason" for the mix up was that they didn't check the part until they were ready to use it.  On one hand, I understand, but from the consumers point of view, it is just an excuse, not a reason.    The gentleman from ARL was there for me to sign the loan documents and he and Ricardo were speaking in Spanish in the background.  I understood bits and pieces of what they were saying.  The guy kept saying Lunes, Lunes, which is Monday, Monday.  I didn't know what they were referring to at the time, but found out later that they had no intention of returning my car to me until Monday.    After hearing Ricardo out about waiting until the warehouse called him on Saturday about the part, I showed restraint, turned around, and walked out.  My husband was much more gracious, thanked him, and shook his hand.  It was well after closing the following day that we actually got the car back in our possession.  I have no idea if the delay was truly due to the wrong part not being there or if it had to do with the ARL agreement and the GPS unit they installed to track my car for the loan.  Either way, the Customer Service sucked.  I had Liz on their tails all day long to make sure I got my car back THAT DAY.  Now, to top it all off, a little more than 75 days after having my AC system replaced, it is only blowing out HOT air.  I have no Air Conditioning during an excessive heat week in Phoenix and a 23 mile commute for work each way.  I will be paying on the repairs (or lack there of) for the next 2 years.  I am more than just a little bit pissed about it.    I wouldn't recommend taking your vehicle to this location for any reason.  It isn't worth the headaches and frustration.  I am disappointed that I have to deal with them again to fix what they already fixed.  Wish me luck.

My husband and I had a Steak Salad from 1130 at the Festival of Arts last weekend.  I have to say, it was absolutely the best Steak Salad I have had in my life.  We have yet to try the restaurant itself, but if their catering was any indication, we look forward to the opportunity.

My husband took me to the San Marcos for the weekend as a birthday gift.  We stopped in to AJ's for dinner just after they opened.  I was a little concerned because of the prices for the food, but that was dispelled as soon as I got my burger.  The serving was really large and every bite was scrumptious.  The cup-o-salad was even awesome!  Caleb and John made a very special night even more special with their excellent service.  Caleb was incredibly polite, it was so refreshing.  Even the chef came out to make sure we were happy with the meal, and we complimented him immensely.  We had a wonderful time.  Thank you so much!!!  The following morning we had the breakfast buffet and were very pleased with the service and options as well.

I have only ever taken my 2003 Ford Taurus to the Baseline SD in Mesa. Everyone there has treated me with respect, every time. The transmission went out a month after I bought the car in December of 2005. They repaired her perfectly in January 2006! Nothing major has happened since that time until I took her back in mid September 2013 when the fuel pump went out. This past week when the check engine light came on had me very concerned, so I took her back to the shop on 10/12/13. My concerns were addressed immediately and the repairs were completed at no charge because of the warranty from the prior service. My husband and I heard more "I am so sorry for the inconvenience," (because we had to come back within a month of the original service), but we were just incredibly grateful that they were able to fix the problem. I won't ever take my car anywhere else! Thank you Chuck, for a job well done!

I will never go back, unless it is free, and then I will still think twice.  I joined staff from the company I work for at an End of Summer Celebration on 9/6/13 from 3-6PM.  The food was excellent, the atmosphere on the patio was acceptable.  It was still a tad too warm out to be on the patio IMHO.  I asked our very inattentive server for an ice water with my beer when I first got there.  They brought the beer pretty quickly but I had to ask again almost 45 minutes later for the water.  When I ordered a second frothy beverage shortly after finally getting my glass of water, it took forever and they brought me the wrong brand.  (The place wasn't that busy) By that time I was hot, tired, and pissed, so I decided to take the opportunity to go home just before 5PM.  The company was good, but the service sucked beyond words.  It isn't worth the chips and salsa to be virtually ignored, especially when you are there with a moderate sized group.

We order a bunch of pizza, usually from Costco....I have to say, this pie was one of the best we have ever had!  The delivery was really quick, the pizza and wings came pipping hot and were crowd pleasers.  I also had a House Salad, it is big enough for 2 people.  Every bite was absolutely delicious and the delivery guy was very polite and professional.  I would highly recommend this spot to anyone.  Next time we will eat in and enjoy some ice cream too!

Installers aren't as well versed as they think they are on the modern technology they are selling.  I had a horrifying experience with this company and ended up with no Air Conditioning for 7 hours.  An emergency 24/7 professional had to come out and repair what Prolink messed up.  Do yourself a favor and don't open the door if they come calling.

Prolink eventually made good on all the mistakes that were made.  It took several emails, and a few months, but the long term issue was completely resolved by December 2014.  It is my honest opinion as a consumer that everything should have been resolved immediately in August, but I will give them credit for at least being professional and making it right.

We took our sons and a friend for a 16th Birthday dinner by request from the Birthday Boy.  My son really wanted to go because they are the only place that serves Faygo that we have found in the area.  We all walked in to a very packed whole in the wall.  The place has a great atmosphere and the gal at the register greeted us immediately.  She was very patient as three teenagers and two adults ordered half the menu.  We had a great time, the food was delicious, and everyone was completely satisfied when we left.  The boys even got to take home extra empty Faygo bottles.  Don't ask me why, I didn't bother asking them why....lol

Pizza joints are all over the place and it is very difficult to find one that truly stands out.  Look no further.  My husband and I started our date night out here and it was literally a food-gasm.  The pizza is made right in front of you, exactly as you order it, and placed in an open fire oven.  I am not at all a fan of thin crust pizza, but I totally ate my words last night.  The price is so affordable that you can bring the entire family.  I also indulged in a side salad and was very pleasantly surprised in the size for the price.  Colin was exceptional with his Customer service and excitement for our first experience there.  Job well done Pieology.  We will be regular patrons.
