Inexpensive, good, and great service make this place a must. We decided to try Blue Fin for lunch, and found the place pretty packed. It's small to begin with so its doesn't take much. I ordered sweet and sour chicken, my girlfriend had Panko chicken.  Prices can't really be lower without being on the dollar menu.  The chicken was decent, not really the best I've had but certainly not the worst. For the price I'm not complaining. 3 maybe 4 stars... but then the service. As we sat outside one of the owners came out to greet us, chatted a bit and took our large cup to refill it for us. Her smile was pleasant enough but her warm inviting attitude and complete joy to hear we tried her restaurant for the first time was wonderful.  I'm big on service, so when she thanked us over and over for coming by for lunch and encouraged us to come back, well that just sealed it for me.

Excellent BBQ at excellent prices. Been driving passed this for months and finally stopped in with my girl and some friends. The pulled pork sandwich was about the best I've had in Phoenix. The sauce is good with a bit of spice. Clean environment, if not a little older. Definitely recommend.

Best donuts in town.  These locations are all great, but this one on McDowell is the best. Everything is clearly labeled, service is fast, and of course the donuts are great.  Stop by before the morning rush and grab a frosted cake donut. Beats the competition hands down any day!

The decor is less vintage and more just hasn't been cleaned or changed in a few decades. The portions were smaller than you'd expect, which my girlfriend suggested might be a harken back to the day. Problem is the prices aren't proportionate.  My pastrami and Swiss on marble rye was pretty burnt and fairly bland. The potato salad hardly had any flavor. I thought perhaps my taste buds were off except the root Beer float was pretty tasty.  Watching a waitress pickup spilled food off the floor with her bare hands, throw it away, then turn around and serve two plates to other customers did it for me.  The ice cream was good, but other places know how to scoop from a carton too...

Came here for dinner and we were starving! I found the general experience to be similar to Chipotle but honestly the food was better.  I had a burrito with chicken and guacamole that didn't come with and extra charge.  Chips and salsa, great environment, I've found a new favorite!

As good as it gets. No seriously. From the overwhelming delicious smell when you walk in the door, to the friendly service this little gem has it all. They have a small menu and we followed the suggestion of getting the #12. Perfect. It's large enough to share but you won't want to.  Make sure to bring CASH but not too much. Prices are fair and you will end up spending it all on their amazing meats.  Definitely worth stopping in.

A small small cafe about as large as a living room, but the food is exceptional and the service is great. It's a little hole in the wall that's almost literally in a hole in a wall.  They cater especially to service members; military, fire and police. A very patriotic place which in my opinion makes it shine a little more.  Definitely worth the visit.

No coffee brewed for 30 minutes before they they a moment to get ONE carafe going. Then it was out before I could get to it thanks to the 30 people who were also waiting for it.  Bagels were dry, even for bagels, on both my bagel sandwiches. And somehow they confused "ham and Swiss" for "egg and cheddar". Sounds the same I guess?? Go to Starbucks across the parking lot instead. We did.

We arrived on a Friday night 10 minutes after the doors opened, the place was already PACKED! We waited for a minute before we were sat. The waitress took our drink orders and we were ready to order by the time she came back.   Our sushi took maybe 10 minutes before it was in front of us, and it was some of the best sushi I've had in Phoenix. I've been all over the valley and sushi is hit or miss. Definitely a hit here.   The staff was great, service was excellent, and the food was spectacular. We will most definitely be coming back again. I cannot recommend this place highly enough.

The menu keeps getting smaller, the prices keep getting higher, and the service hasn't gotten any better.   We called ahead for 11am and walked in at 1050. They didn't seat us until 1120 and we didn't see a waitress for a little over 10 minutes and we ordered right away for fear we wouldn't see her again in a while.   Food was good but took 40 minutes to come out. Overall not impressed.

Good food, better service.   Tucked away in an industrial complex is a little restaurant worthy of praise. The food was excellent, not super greasy like most diner type places, and the service was excellent. The waitresses were especially friendly and even laughed with us after I managed to spill my water all over the place.   I don't make it out here often but when I do I'll make sure to come back.

Good sushi at a decent price. To clarify I'd have to say this is this best sushi I've had on the strip, at a very decent price. Service wasn't bad considering we came around lunch time. We ordered several rolls and some crab cakes. The crab cakes were different than i have had before but enjoyable. The sushi was far better than two other locations I have been to on the Las Vegas strip. All in all a good experience.

A really good, of the strip place for breakfast.  I've found there's not a lot of places to grab breakfast on the strip, unless you're talking a buffet. Too many people still asleep I guess. But if you stay off the strip and are looking for a non-cookie cutter restaurant Jamms is it.  I had the eggs Benedict, which was perfect, and my girlfriend had the steak and eggs. We split a strawberries  and cream pot of bread which is really a must if you go here.   Service was friendly and fast. Prices were reasonable. We'll definitely come back on our next Vegas trip. Highly recommended.

I've been coming to El Encanto for 20 years. It's a beautiful place with pretty good food. I've always expected to wait, but on my first time back in years with family from out of town we waited 90 minutes to sit while others have come and gone.   We tried calling in to make reservations but were told they weren't taking reservations. Upon arriving and putting our name down we were asked why we hadn't called in a reservation. After explaining the situation we were told it would be 30 minutes. Not a bad wait but 90 is uncalled for.   It's sad to see service suffer so badly but I have to say this will be my last trip here. Not worth the drive, not worth waiting this long.

Ok so getting the obvious out of the way...the cakes are amazing. Since you eat with your eyes first, presentation matters. Tammy Coe has that down to an art. Then there's the flavors which can't be praised enough. Their bakery items are excellent too, and even their breakfast items are wonderful.  Coffee and tea earn high marks as well. All around great. Incredibly though that isn't what makes this tony shop click.  The people.  From the moment you walk in the door you are met by people that seem to love working there and they share that joy with you. Always friendly faces, smiles, and impeccable service. While you wait for a pour-over coffee they make sure you have a few minutes and are prompt letting you know when it's ready. In 2 years of going here for morning meetings or First Friday sweets I have yet to have a bad experience.  Bottom line, if you want something sweet and service is important this place is worth the trip.

I visited Daphne's on my birthday after receiving a free birthday meal in my email. They were extremely courteous and even sang me happy birthday. The manager Scott was friendly and of course the food is great.  Not too expensive on any day, and I always find Greek food to be filling. Highly recommend.

One of the best contemporary mexican food restaurants around. The staff is friendly and fun, the food is filling and delicious. A must for mexican food lovers. Love their fresh guacamole and house margaritas.

By far one of my favorite coffee shops in the area. The light rail is across the street so it's super easy to get to. Plenty of parking too if you're driving.  The atmosphere is artistic and relaxed, the coffee is good and the food is wonderful.  Downtown Phoenix is not lacking in great little hangouts like this, but Fair Trade might just be my favorite.

Having worked for Starbucks years ago I know what it's like behind the bar. What frustrates me about this particular store is it never really seems to be "busy" but they are consistently slow! I've been coming here since they built it and I've seen staff come and go. Still one of the slowest Starbucks locations I have ever been to!  I'm not sure why exactly but nobody ever seems to be in any kind of hurry behind the bar. It's aggravating knowing I used to be timed at how fast my crew could crank out drinks at some of the busiest stores in Arizona.   I am a loyalist, and I'll keep drinking the coffee, but I think I'm done here and ready to find another location to visit. If you're in a hurry, STAY AWAY from this one.

Great prices, incredible food, fresh ingredients. My girlfriend and I tried this place since it's close to her house, and we were so amazingly surprised. The atmosphere is that of a mini-sports bar, with arcade games in the back for kids and TVs around the walls.  The pizza was incredible. The wings were amazing. And the cook came out to introduce himself and chat with us about the food and what we liked or disliked about it. We will most definitely be returning in the future.

The view is amazing, and that's where it ends.  The selection of sushi really disappointed my girlfriend and I, so we decided to try two of the signature rolls and one old favorite. All of it was bland, over-priced, and just really not worth the time and effort to go there.  The only other upside besides the view was the house Sake was pretty decent. Other than that, spend your money elsewhere.

Came in early on Saturday morning and got seated right away. Eduard cut my hair and was very friendly while he took right to my mop of hair. I've been to several V's over the past few years and go there almost exclusively anymore. This was a great experience, I would highly recommend.

Good tea, horrible service.   I've been here several times with my girlfriend, and after the last time we've decided not to come back. Once you walk in the door you're never greeted by any of the people behind the counter, which every time we've been seem to be teenage girls more interested in their own conversations than the paying customers. Eventually we were asked if we would like something, and after we received out tea and sandwiches we never saw or heard from anyone again.  I tried several times in a loud but polite voice to get someone's attention so I could buy some tea for Christmas presents. No avail. After waiting at the counter for 10 minutes while the girls chatted I was finally able to pay for our cup of tea and sandwiches and head out the door.   Sorry, but I absolutely cannot recommend this place.

To start I love the location. We sat outside on a beautiful cool evening. The food was really good, of course it helped that I was hungry. I would recommend the Sangria and the sweet potato fries any day.  That's where it ends. The hostess was rude, the waiter hardly paid us any attention. My girlfriend and I even noticed that he seemed to deliberately walk past our table looking over our heads but never once stopped to see if we needed anything. He didn't bring our food, someone else did. He didn't refill our waters, or ask if we needed more alcohol...  We had to flag him down by shouting loudly to get his attention, which I never, ever do in a restaurant. He finally came to see if we wanted our check without asking if we would like dessert our how the meal was. Funny thing, they weren't even that busy.   If I go back, I will hope for better service. If you don't mind bad service then go for the food.

They give a good haircut, but what's the point of making an appointment if they won't keep it? I come here often, and I think this will be my last trip to tis location. They always take forever so I started making appointments which they recommend.   They still don't keep to the appointment times so I have to block an hour or more just for a simple trim.  Morning noon or night doesn't matter. If I come early there's only one barber cutting. And any other time they're too busy so I'm going to wait no matter what.   Maybe I'll luck out with another place instead.

Haven't been here in a while due to poor service, so we thought we'd try this morning.  Staff was cleaning up from a large party that had just left so our table was clean. We were the only ones in the place at the time but it still took 10 minutes to take our coffee order. We knew what we wanted and ordered right away, then waited about 40 minutes to get our food, which wasn't worth the wait.  One coffee refill, lackluster service. We left and will not be back.

Well we've been coming here a while. We even moved into the apartment next door and thought this would be our regular place.  Then this morning we decided to try breakfast there. Mistake. After ordering a breakfast sandwich to go we sat and waited while plate after plate passed the handoff plane. One to-go order came up but it clearly wasn't mine. After 15 minutes I decided to ask what was going on. Politely since I know accidents happen. The girl behind the bar told me I need to wait 10 minutes and they'll call my name. End.  Now I'm hungry and peeved. So we wait longer. Another 15 minutes go by and I ask a different girl if my order fell through the cracks. She actually goes to check with the cook who has no recollection of my order at all and says someone else probably took it.  She offers a refund, I decline saying I don't mind waiting if they make it right. She says it'll be done in 5 minutes.  Another 15 minutes go by, (45 since I ordered) and a to-go item pops up in the window. I immediately check it out and ask if it's my breakfast sandwich. The cook tells me she's not sure what it is even though SHE just put it there. She asks my name and checks the tickets then explains she turned my sandwich into an omelet instead.  I take it and we leave.  Looks like we'll be finding a different place for local breakfast. I understand accidents happen but lack of communication and organization when dealing with people's food is just irresponsible.

Read the fine print. If you spend the money for a suite, but have more than 4 people in it at one time, they'll ask you to clear out.  My brothers wedding was this weekend and he and his new wife paid for a wrap around one bedroom suite. Drinks and cupcakes were offered, minus any loud music or shenanigans. About an hour into it two security showed up explaining that they weren't allowed to have more than 4 persons in the room at any given time.  I thought this was Las Vegas!! Security suggested everyone go downstairs to the Vesper bar or Chandelier bar... To spend money on THEIR drinks or in their casino.  Everyone complained.  Nothing was done. We come to Vegas several times each year, and will not be coming to the Cosmopolitan anymore.

Having had to use several storage facilities over the last three years I can say I am a fan of this location. The staff have always been supremely friendly and helpful, even when I fell behind on payments. The unit I have is in a climate controlled building so I never have to worry about the extreme Arizona heat destroying my property. And with two electronically controlled entrances plus the requirement of an extra secure lock on my unit, I feel safe storing my property here.   4 stars instead of 5... only because the location is a little hard to access given the proximity to the light rail. Not their fault, but still. I would recommend storing here.

An absolute must. My girlfriend and I found this place almost by accident, and because of her addiction to chocolate we decided to give it a try. We shard a pizza and it was well big enough for the both of us. Then came my amazing cappuccino followed by the most incredible chocolate gelato sundae.   Incredible decor and style throughout makes you feel like you're sitting in an old pub. Highly recommend.

A fantastic, inexpensive diner setting on the edge of an old shopping center. I tried the breakfast burrito with meat, bacon, and was amazed at the size of it when they brought it quickly and promptly.   Delicious food, fast and friendly service, warm inviting atmosphere. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back myself.   Excellent prices make this a must.

Found by accident or perhaps divine intervention. Truly this is what Phoenix has been missing in the independent film circuit. Good drinks at very reasonable prices and a single spacious theater where they screen local as well as international independent films. Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. A must for the art community. Highly recommended.

Excellent idea! Cheap and delicious ice cream and ice cream sandwiches. Haven't tried their milkshakes yet but a homemade ice cream sandwich made with two fresh cookies for $2 is awesome.   Great for kids. Great for adults. So glad to see this place on Mill Ave.

Came here by chance one weekday evening. Nice casual atmosphere, friendly service. The salsa is hot, the menu is small and concise.   I ordered the carnitas tacos, my girlfriend had the carne asada tacos. Both orders came out quickly. The rice was especially good. My pork was a little tough but had a really good flavor. Her steak was also tough but had a good flavor as well.   Not much to complain about. Very reasonable prices, good service. Good food. Not stellar but worth a trip for sure.

Absolutely amazing. Think Chipotle for enchiladas. Nice patio, plenty of room inside. The food is really amazing. The prices are great. If you're not in the area it's actually worth the trip.   I ordered 2 chicken enchiladas. I'll be back to try the tacos!

The inside isn't much to write home about, but the food and service are Amazing. I order the "San Francisco style" French toast, which have a hint of lemon and are flash fried after being cooked the normal way. So they've got a mildly crisp outside and tender on the inside. Incredible.  The service was wonderful, we were checked up on often and never ran out of coffee.  Tucked away and almost easy to miss, I have to highly recommend a stop here. The place was busy when we arrived and busy when we left. I can see why.

Our second visit to this place. Their sushi is good and tastes fresh which is definitely a plus when ordering raw fish in the desert (Phoenix). We love the patio and the service has been great both times.  Bento boxes are great for lunch. Las Vegas rolls are great anytime.

A little on the pricey side for "gourmet" hot dogs, so that takes away a star. However overall I really can't complain. Their food is unique, to say the least, and is definitely a niche. They're located right on Roosevelt Row in downtown Phoenix so given the amount of regular foot traffic it is tricky to stay in business there.  On our visit I was stunned how silly and goofy the waitress was. Maybe it was just me and the long trip we just returned from but it was refreshing that she was just as interested in chatting with my girlfriend and I as she was in taking our orders.  Honestly we ended up getting the appetizer, dinner, and dessert for that very reason.  Service is big for me, having worked in the food service industry myself in the past. So I can't speak highly enough about great service.  Again it's a unique joint but worth the drive into downtown and certainly worth the price.

A new and refreshing venue with good coffee and a relaxing laid back environment. Inside offers a warm and inviting atmosphere, and the patio faces east, away from the afternoon sun; which is a big plus in Phoenix. Plenty of space inside to sit and enjoy or do a little work. Owner was extremely friendly and courteous. Definitely recommend stopping by.

I never thought a food court food stop could be so good. Even the low price makes it seem sketchy but the food is actually incredible.  The chicken katsu is by far my favorite but their teriaki chicken and yes even sushi is wonderful.  Its worth going out of the way to park at the mall, head indoors and find the place. Dont let the location fool you!

Excellent atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff, good food.   The burgers are great, from presentation to taste I have zero complaints.   It's mildly noisy on the patio with Tatum Blvd right there but the ambiance is great and it's in the shade (keep in mind for summers).   When were recommended a blueberry cookie, ice cream dessert and tried it. Absolutely amazing. Prices were very reasonable, so all around I can highly suggest this place and will return for sure.

I had a craving for tacos, good homemade street tacos, so we found this place and made the drive into downtown Phoenix. The atmosphere was wonderful, the service was great, the chef even came out to greet us himself.  The Tacos. Oh the Tacos. Everything is small portion and made fresh. I had two Carne Asada and one Pork Belly. My girlfriend had two fish tacos. They were all amazing.  The price is very reasonable as well. I absolutely recommend this place, whether it's tacos, flautas, or margaritas you're in the mood for.

I was wary when Paradise Bakery got bought out, but I thought what could go wrong? Everything. Everything went wrong.   All my favorite reasons for coming to this location were gone. The atmosphere and cafe completely changed, somehow reducing the amount of seating in what was once a large, vast dining area that could accommodate the heavy lunch crowds this location received.   then the food. they have completely revamped the menu to fit the Panera Bread MO. In other words when I asked for Fire Roasted Tomato Soup I heard "that was unhealthy so we don't offer it anymore". When I asked for the tortellini, "We've been out of that since yesterday".  I settled on a blonde, tasteless turkey something-or-other that was advertised as "New and Fresh!" Tasteless.   I won't be coming back. Ever. I will instead have to find a new and fresh salad soup and sandwich dining experience elsewhere.
