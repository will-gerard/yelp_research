If I could rate this place 0 I would....watch every bite of your food closely you may find a little creature in your food...and they will do nothing about it except take your food back and not refund you and tell you to get lost...RUDEST PEOPLE EVER!!

I don't think I have anything bad to say about this place. I really like it and I love that it's big enough that we really never have to wait 45 min to get a table. The servers are very friendly. The food is yum always gets me stuffed and satisfied. I am sure there are other dim sum places but I think this one is usually my first choice restaurant is clean and I love that the owner is always there helping out his employees.

I have been here a few times it's always been good. I went there Friday and got my usual number 8 Pho special... Well as I was eating I saw a piece of hair in my bowl I was done.. I let the waiter know and I love that they did just brush it off. He told the manager and they took the bowl off my bill and offered me a new one togo. Most places will just have a oh well that sucks attitude, but the way they handled it I will still go there and eat. Thank You!!!

I like classic car spa because they do everything by hand don't have to worry about anything scratching your car. I have been coming here for years and after being to other places don't think I will ever go anywhere else. The staff is very friendly. The employees do a great job all the time.

Mmmmm this place was yum. We usually go to yogurtland but wanted to try something new. I have driven by orange leaf a lot but never a second did i think about stoping. Walked in and i love how much room there is and very clean. Friendly customer service also. Glad I finally decided to go in and try it.  I like the pineapple flavored yogurt. It's hidden back in the corner and I will definitely go here again.

Well what to say....I was driving around and yelped somewhere to get a mani for my daughter and me. I found Nail Lux Bar on yelp with 5 stars and was like hmm lets try this place. I wish I never had wasted my time and money. I went on Saturday the 1st and today is Tuesday the 4th my nail are already peeling. I knew they would because I seriously paid $15 for a 5 min mani and only one clear coat. No base coat or anything. Oh and I forgot to mention that I waited 45 min for a 5 min mani. .I was very disappointed and have never been this disappointed in a long time. ..

I had this for the first time. ..drove by it all the time but never stopped to try it.  Finally we tried it. .I have to say it was pretty good. I had the pho special and the Bahn con I ate it all.. the only thing was that they needed some more help. 1 guy running around like crazy with a full house.  I will definitely be back again!

Over all this place was pretty good. The wait sucked but food made up for it. I had the chilaquiles it had lots of flavor. It was a little pricey for the portions you get. I am not sure if I would ever come back here again though.

I yelped this place because I wanted to come close to home.  Last time I yelped a nail place I was disappointed. Not this time! I got some tips done and I love them! Staff is friendly and everyone seems happy to be here. I will definitely be returning soon!

I love this place I am so glad we finally got one closer to the east valley. We have probably tried almost all the combos of the Snow... I don't think I haven't like any of them yet... this is the place to go to especially on a hot day in Arizona. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are great... :)

I live about 2 miles from this place always drove by it, but never tried it. So we finally tried it! It was really good. I wasn't disappointed at all. Every dish had lots of flavor we had about 7 diffteny dishes. (Beef Chow fun,eggplant &tofu, generals tso chicken, house fried rice, egg Rolls, walnut prawns and Mo Pa tofu) can't wait to try more off the menu.

I used to go to European Wax and I have to say ever since I have been going to Waxing the City I will never go back there.  Waxing the City doesn't rush they take their time and get everything. European Wax rushes your done in 15 min. Waxing the City spends the time. My waxer Melinda is amazing. Try this place you will love it

I have no idea what to say about this place. It has honestly taken me a few days to even think of something to say. Where do I begin.... first it was very unorganized, everyone was running around. People standing waiting in the front with no one greeting. I stood there at first and was confused if someone was going to take our name down. There was an older couple that had already been waiting prior to us arriving who left. My husband asked me if i just wanted to go somewhere else. I said no I want to try this place. So we ended up sitting at the bar. Our waitress was very nice. We ordered Chicken Karaage, Nishikawa Black, and the Spicy Miso. The broth literately tasted like powder and was so thick and I just cant even describe it. It was starting to turn into gelatin . My Pork on the top of my Spicy Miso was nothing but a big piece of fat I couldn't even eat it. The noodles where hard and could have been boiled a lot longer. The appetizer was probably the only good think oh and the house Green Tea. I also thought that it was really unusual that they were putting dirty dishes on the back bar where they put the food that was ready to go to a customer. I don't think I will be returning. My cup of ramen the next day was better....
