The food here is really good here. The staff is friendly and the place has a nice ambiance. The Chicken Sish Kabob is recommended. You can have your food with saffron rice or salad or half and half (both). The salad is absolutely delicious!  A little warning about the Persian ice cream though. It is vanilla with pistachio bits, saffron and rose wash so it will taste like you're eating perfume. If you are not into unusual tasting food, then don't order this.   If you have an adventurous side and want to try this, I can say that after 3-4 bites of this ice cream, the perfume taste gradually becomes less noticeable.   Cheers!

I can't say the food here is great. Their pho is good though. Smoothie (with boba) is not always available. I went there a few weeks back, their blender was broken. The next time they didn't have the flavor I wanted. So I don't recommend ordering the smoothie boba.   The chicken fried rice wasn't great. The chicken pieces were tough and the rice was a little hard to chew. It was almost like they just got it out of the fridge and heated it up in the microwave. Or maybe they let it sit in the frying pan for too long.   But when it comes to food presentation, they do a nice job at it. But I've had better.

The food is alright but the portions are great, especially if you order the combo meal. There must have been 5 sides that came with my food and I paid less than $10. Occasionally there may be a fly or two that will circle around your food. But who doesn't have those right? The servers are your typical Asian servers, indifferent yet friendly. Apparently it has a new name and now has cooking tables where you can grill your food. It's somewhat disappointing to say that this new and improved restaurant is still the same as it once was.

Everytime I come here I'm always treated nicely by the staff. They're friendly and do an excellent job. The food is good too. I ordered the strawberry lemonade and it was delightfully tasty. But honestly I've had better. Same goes with their coffee as well.   I had the red, white and blue slam yesterday and it was okay. It's not as good as they advertise it on tv. It's a good thing they only offer it for a limited time.
