Service was good and so was food. Got pink eye and can almost guarantee I can trace it back to this place by the activities I did and the lack of company hygiene paid to equipment throughout the day.

Great place run by a fantastic lady. Handles all the family's hair needs no matter the cut.

The food was good but not deserving of the price on the menu. The bartender and server were not attentive at all making the experience even worse.

This place doesn't know what it wants to be but I can tell you what it is: WEAK. From the management sitting on it's ass at the bar to the out of stock draft selections. Do me a favor you're in downtown chandler please accept that fact and embrace the average bar scene or the family restaurant crowd, you can't have both. Oh and PS thanks for the flat/room temperature 4th beer choice I made.

Just stopped in for lunch and enjoyed the "stacked italian". Service was attentive and quick with answers. Can't wait to come back for a pie in the pizza oven.
