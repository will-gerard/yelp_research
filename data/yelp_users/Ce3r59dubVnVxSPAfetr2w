I used to love this place  but now I change my mind.  CRAZY ANNOYING RACING IN THE PARKING LOT AND MOTORCYLEs being revved up at 5:30am...the units are nice and there are some great neighbors but it's always a few bad neighbors.

DEAR Manager in the store... I just saw an elderly woman doing carts runs and loading it so sad...Don't you guys have young man's that does the job for cart runs not a grandma.... Customer service can't even say hello or sorry I'm busy at this moment doing western union but instead I'm busy right now with a bad tone okayyyyy then won't be back....

Nice cozy place but don't let that fool you. Me and my husband went for our anniversary dinner waitress was nice at first. Then the meat keep coming but after 20 minutes its stop and the waitress forget about you. I was really pissed was so hungry i didnt want the salad bar. I wanted the meat but was only good for 20 minutes even if my sign said green...horrible service and will not ever come back here.
