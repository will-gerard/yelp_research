I really enjoyed this place.  I've seen it a hundred times when going to the library and I finally was in the area right about lunch time.  I got the coconut shrimp plate which has the shrimp, salad, and white rice.  Add a massively large drink (with free refills) and the total was just over $10.  More than filling.  If you don't want the drink and get a smaller rice bowl instead of a plate then you can probably grab a fresh lunch for under $7.  Everything just kind of works together.  I saw the salad on top of warm rice and my mind wasn't too excited, but there is something about the way they make it where it just mixes together well.  The dressing really makes it all come together.  The shrimp is hot, fresh, and isn't overly greasy; no oil splotches on the plate.  The dipping sauce is, like the dressing, a really good compliment to the shrimp.  Everything on the plate was good and a nice change of pace.  Really friendly workers, nice mix of guests, very convenient parking.  It looks small but it can handle a lot of people and there is even a drive-thru window.  One minor negative, and this is kind of strange, but it's the fork size.  It's a small plastic fork and you can't really get rice and lettuce on it.  I asked for a spoon after a few minutes of trying to balance everything.

Did the Yelp check in coupon for $2 off.  The guy looks at the screen and says "Yeah we don't take those anymore."  No prob...I just walked out and did the one star review from the parking lot.  The good news is that you saved $2...hope it was worth it.

Places like this seem to have a really difficult staffing problem.  They just don't hire enough people to handle situations that can come up, and with printing and shipping it can happen a lot.  When I was there one lady was having trouble tracking a package and one employee was with her for about 15 minutes.    I had a color print job that I tried on the self service machines but it was smudging, so the guy guy offered to do it for me behind the counter and it took him a few minutes.  Again, that caused a longer wait for others at the counter.  The next time I went straight to the counter to get my prints, and the lady was obviously stressed out.  She aligned my pdf then helped someone else, then started my print job then helped someone else, then answered the phone, then cut my prints in half.  We all just got lucky that someone didn't need anything time intensive or else the whole process would have broken down.

I enjoyed this place.  It's a throwback to places you might have eaten at as a kid.  I got the lunch special which is 2 hot dogs, fries, and a drink for $5.99 ($6.55 inc. tax).  The dogs were great with the fixings.  The fries are the shoestring kind (not thick cut steak fries) which is what I like.  The food is served in a basket and the ketchup comes out of the old school squeeze bottles.  I was in and out in less than 20 minutes and spent less than $7.  Nice place to pop into if you want to go old school for a change.

They've just finished a major refurbishment.  Looks pretty good.  The food is typical Denny's, the servers are friendly.

I went in at 11:30 AM to beat the rush and got seated quickly and had my order placed within a couple of minutes.  Not more than 5 minutes later my food was ready.  I ordered the chimichanga with ground beef.  Nice mix of spices, but not too heavy which is what I like.  Some places tend to add too much to ground beef and it dominates the taste.  The rice has a pepper mix added to it which wasn't to my liking, but to each his own.  The beans could use more flavor or maybe some cheese on top to mix in.  The server and bus boy were both friendly and came around very often.  Overall the chimi was great, the place was clean, and the service was good.

Overall, good experience, but could have been a hair better.  I ordered the #6 Chicken Tamale Deluxe Combo because of what other people have written.  The chicken green corn tamale is just as everyone said said, a unique flavor that really satisfies.  If you can get one or two unique things out of a Mexican restaurant then you've done well, and this was it.  A close second was the ground beef flour taco.  I usually don't spend much time ordering tacos at restaurants but this one had a shell that was hard enough to hold it's form but soft enough to bend a little when you took a bite.  The bottom of the shell mixed with the juices from the beef and created a texture that I'd not had in a taco before.  Delicious.  One disappointment was the shredded beef flauta. Nothing to write home about and without a knife I ended up stabbing it and taking bites off of it.  One other disappointment was the salsa and hot sauce, but I chalk this up to personal preference so I don't really downgrade restaurants because of it. The salsa had chunks of fresh veggies but the flavor wasn't to my liking, and it had quite a bit of juice in it.  You ended up getting some veggies on top and then juice which ran off of the chip.  The hot sauce has an earthy flavor to it that just didn't do it for me, but others seem to enjoy it so to each his own.  Last point, the rice and beans were excellent.  Some places try to do too much or too little, but El Bravo found the perfect balance of spices and natural flavor.  Really enjoyed it.  As for the extras, the restaurant is easy to find and there is plenty of parking.  The wait staff was very friendly and the food came fast.  Not much ambiance but you're kind of looking for that from time to time.

Good place overall.  The sesame beef (see picture) had nice texture and the sauce had a tangy kick to it.  The pork friend rice was excellent overall, they use the cubes of red pork instead of the nondescript strips.  Overall quality was a step above the average Chinese take out.

Really friendly place and good food overall.  I ordered the baked ziti and it was just how I like it.  I'm not a huge fan of any red sauce but they mix in a lot of cheeses which gives it more of a blended flavor.  Usually when I see "baked" and "pasta" I expect a soft, mushy mess, but the ziti had a lot of firmness to it which is what I want.  I didn't get around to eating the garlic bread until an hour after I ordered and I was expecting a brick, but somehow it managed to say soft.  Nice bonus.  I got a slice as well to try it out.  They serve thin pizza, but I'm more of a thick crust person, but it was good overall.  The crumbled sausage is just what I like.  The staff was friendly and they seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Nice place to take a family.

I really enjoy this place.  It can be whatever you want it to be.  I've been there and had nothing but tofu, salad, edamame, and sushi.  And I've been there other times and got my fill of the standard heart attack items as well.  It's a $10 buffet so don't expect the world when it comes to flavor, but I've tried most of the dishes and they're passable.  I generally don't go to buffets since I like quality over quantity but this one is the exception, especially since I can get as much sushi and tofu as I want.

Good enough place.  About what you'd expect on the inside.  Easy to find, easy parking.  Fast with the refills.  The Kung Pao is pretty good.  They use a selection of vegetables that *snap* when you bite into them which is nice, makes it taste fresh.  Sometimes stir fry kills the texture of the veggies but they do a good job here.  Very reasonably priced.  You can get the lunch special which is more than enough for 1 and have some left over, then be out the door for a total of $10 including tax and tip.

I just didn't have the same experience that other people did.  I ordered the link, the brisket, and the ribs.  All three were dry.  I'm enclosing a picture.  I saw DDD and Guy holds up one of the links to the camera to show the juices coming out but mine was nothing like that.  Most reviews say the food is moist so I'm guessing that I got a bad batch.  A couple of less than average reviews say the meat was dry so maybe I was one of the unlucky ones.  One thing I noticed right off the bat was that the food is kept in warming bins, which was surprising.  When the server took off the lid to the links they just didn't look very appetizing.  I noticed from other reviews is that a lot of other people ordered items that had sauce in it, like the pulled pork or the cut links.  Maybe if you get 3 items that have no sauce there's nothing there to give it moisture.  The mac & cheese was good; I don't usually like since it never really lives up to the promise, but this serving did.  Very good overall.  The staff were friendly.  I arrived at 11:30 and avoided most of the rush.  I was the 2nd person in line when I ordered, but when I got outside the line was out the door.  I arrived earlier to try to get more "fresh" product but that's just not what I got.

Really great place for carne asada.  Asadero Toro takes the minimalist approach and it works well.  The carne asada tacos and burritos just come with two things:  carne asada and a tortilla.  From there you can go to the salsa bar and add what you want to taste.  To get away with this you have to have good carne asada and this place does.  It has a nice balance of spices.  Most places either add too much or too little.  The salsa and pico are fresh.  If you order the rice and beans you can get them inside the burrito if you want.  One thing that I didn't like:  can sodas.  I tend to drink a lot of fluids when I eat and going through cans kinda sucks.  Other than that it's a place worth checking out.  Really easy access, easy parking, fresh, and cheap (under $10).

Disclaimer:  I love "retro" places; it makes my overall experience better.  I stopped by to get my yearly fix for ice cream.  I really don't seek it out or have too much of a sweet tooth, but when the mood strikes....  I ordered a scoop of chocolate and a scoop of butter pecan.  Both were excellent.  The butter pecan is incredibly creamy.  Do you know how you put some ice cream on a spoon and take several runs at it, taking off a layer at a time?  It was so creamy that when I did that, the ice cream would form a little tail off the spoon that would hang over the edge.  I've never had ice cream like that before.  I didn't try the food, no comment there.  The waitresses are super friendly.  One recommendation that I'd make would be to have a counter.  I was just there to get some ice cream but you have to go through the restaurant experience of waiting to be seated, getting a booth, reading a menu, etc.  I was mostly looking for a quick in and out.  Also, as some people noted, it's not cheap.  My two scoops totaled $4.28, and with waitress service I ended up leaving $6 to cover a tip.  It's not a place that you go to weekly but if you want a fun experience with the family every now and then it hits the spot.

I was hesitant to go to Mi Patio, but I'm glad I did.  If you scroll down through most of the reviews you'll see a pattern.  The people who rate it high usually comment, "You can't beat $2 margaritas!" or you have a handful of comments from vegans who are happy to have found a Mexican option.  Reviewers who stuck to talking about the food generally had lower ratings, so I had my reservations.  But in the end I was just down the street so I decided to give it a try.  I got the gyro chimi and it just worked.  The flavor of the Greek classic came through perfectly inside of the Mexican wrapping.  The cucumber sauce, lamb, and fried shell matched up perfectly.  The zucchini side was an interesting change of pace and the rice was excellent.  I enjoyed everything on the plate.  One knock against it:  It's oily.  The contents of the chimi (lamb, peppers, onions) can't be as densely packed as a regular chimi so you start to notice some pockets of oil that form on the plate.  Yes, I know a chimi is oily, but you usually it's absorbed by the food inside of it so you don't see it to the same extent.  Give the chimi a shot and you won't regret it.  I was there on a Saturday afternoon and the place has a nice mix of people enjoying some Mexican with others socializing at the bar.  Good options for a wide range of people.

I found an old menu off on the internet and used that to make my selections.  Perhaps it was a very, very old menu because what I calculated to be about $17 and change ended up being $23 and change once I ordered.  Sesame Beef (quart size):  Had a cheap feel to it and the sauce was a bit sweet for my liking.  I'm used to beef with a lite coating but this was more heavily breaded.  House Special Friend Rice:  Very, very dry.  The rice could easily be separated into individual pieces.  The beef, chicken, and shrimp were skimpy.  Egg Rolls:  Overall very good, much larger than typical.  Service:  Easy to order on the phone, polite delivery driver.  One big negative was that they brought no soy sauce and no hot mustard even though I asked for them on the phone.  I only received a very small container of sweet & sour sauce.  The average quality of the food was magnified since I wasn't able to season it to taste.  Most of these issues can be chalked up to my own person taste, so to each his own.  I've found a lot of Chinese restaurants have dry fried rice.  Others might like the sweeter, breaded sesame beef.  The combo prices (include extras like 1 egg roll, rice, etc) are very cheap so if I give this place another try I'll go that route.  I can handle average Chinese food like I can handle average pizza, but only if the price makes up for the difference.  At $23 (not including tip) it just wasn't worth it.

Standard Office Max store in terms of products, but the staff is great and the store usually doesn't have many customers.  When I had to wait behind people in line they opened up a new register.  Parking is a breeze.  Very friendly and convenient overall.

I was excited about this place after doing a search for "best chimichanga in Phoenix" on Google, but it didn't live up to my expectations.  I ordered the carne asada chimi but part of me wonders if that's what I got.  I couldn't taste much of the spices, especially the cumin.  There were also some sauteed onions inside so part of me wonders if I got the fajita chimi on accident.  There just wasn't much taste to the meat which made the chimi average overall.  The rice looked fine, but it had a burnt taste to it.  Maybe something happened with the broth?  I love beans smothered in cheese but there just wasn't much taste to either of them.  After a few minutes on the plate it hardened up and needed to be cut into sections by a fork.  A couple of bright spots....  The salsa is good, both the regular and the hot.  They bring you a massive bowl of chips to snack on.  The waiter, I can't remember his name, was friendly and outgoing.  Also, I tend to like to overall feel of these kinds of places.  Not too fancy and looks old school.  One last thing....  I went there on a Saturday mid-afternoon and the bar section was completely hopping.  I'm not sure what that was about but my guess is that if you're looking for a place to put back a few on a Saturday then try Tee Pee.  I just can't recommend the food.

The Flamingo has evolved into a decent mid-sized option for Vegas.  It won't have all of the bells and whistles of the megaresorts, but it has a lot more to offer than the budget hotels.  Call it a nice medium.  I've been to Vegas maybe 30 times and I've grown into a more relaxing pace, which the Flamingo is good for.  It's big enough to offer a lot of services but not too big where you're walking 5 minutes to get from place to place.  The casino, elevators, and restaurants are all close by.  The staff are friendly and the people are relaxed.  It's probably not the best option if you're looking for amazing nightlife or a wild weekend, but it's centrally located so all of those things are close by if that's why you want.  Great access to the beautiful Paris and Bellagio, and City Center is a couple of walkways away.  The rooms are the same, much better than the budget hotels but obviously a bit older.  The renovations are nice and the size is good, and so is the bed.  The bathroom is small if that's important to you.  I went mid-week during the slow season so the price was $26.  Definitely worth the price considering you'll be paying the same for Excalibur or the Stratosphere.  It's a big step up from those places if those are your options.

I often go to this shop and I enjoy it.  It's a bit larger than usual so you can do work at the tables or relax in the large chairs.  The staff is friendly and by now they usually know my order.  Lots of parking and the drive-thru is fast.  One con is that the large chairs tend to have crumbs in them.  You have to do a brush down before you sit.

Overall it's a different change of pace.  I've read a few reviews and people who complain about the food or the story are missing the point.  The show depends on audience participation.  That makes it work or not work.  We had a good crowd of willing participants and people cheered others on.  Our "Big Daddy" character from the audience just killed it.  There was a dance scene with 5 or 6 guests on stage and one guy just took over the dancing and was funny as hell. If your show doesn't have a few people like that then the mood probably takes a pretty big dive.  The cast seems genuinely interested in what they are doing.

I usually take the car to the dealership for everything, but since I've moved and it's far away and I wanted to get a quick oil change to turn off that damn warning light....  Usually I'm pretty skeptical of places like these because I don't want to do the upselling dance.  That being said, this was a great shop to go to.  I had been to the dealership about 6 months before and got a new air filter and kind of knew where I stood on the car.  The guy I worked with, Nivaro (sorry if I spelled that wrong) gave me a run-down on the car and what he said basically matched up with the dealership.  Professional, young guy.  Air filter had some dust, but no need to change it yet, fluids were good, etc.  I was waiting for a pitch on something I didn't need but it didn't come.  He threw in a headlight defogging service which I need but passed on, but that was pretty much it.  In and out fast, easy to get to, can't really think of anything I didn't like.

Really nice local restaurant, give them a try if you're looking for good Mexican.  I ordered the carne asada burrito, enchilada style, with a large soda, the total was $10.85.  I left another $2 at the table bringing the total to $12.85.  Good bargain since I still have half the burrito left.  And free chips and salsa.  The carne asada has good flavor, and they mixed in chopped up peppers and cilantro which gave it that extra level of flavor.  I love me some carne asada but too many restaurants just put meat into a tortilla and call it a day.  This one struck a nice "freshness" balance with just that small addition.  Very friendly staff, plenty of parking in the rear, free refills on sodas.  Order at the counter, then get table service after.  Good place for families.

I've been going to the gym for a couple of months.  It's the first gym I've been to in Phoenix so I can't compare it to others.  My initial introduction was done by Beau and he was polite and professional.  No rush and no pressure.  The staff makes a point to welcome you by your first name and say goodbye when you leave.  I've asked a couple of questions and they were helpful.  The place is large and there are plenty of machines.  I've been at different times of the day/night and I haven't had any problems, except for the ab machine.  It seems that everyone likes the same machine so you have to keep your eye out for it.  Other than that you won't have a problem finding the machines you need.  The pool and jacuzzi are nice and clean.  I read a comment about the locker room and I can understand.  They need to devote one area to people who are leaving the pool or shower.  The tile floors can create puddles that are hard to work around when you are trying to change clothes.  Some indoor/outdoor carpeting in the right areas could probably solve the problem.  Other than that, the place is clean, has plenty of parking, plenty of machines, great location for me, and good staff.

It's strange that I'm writing a 2-star review for the place I frequent so much....  I've been going here for a couple of years and I've gotten to know the staff and they're friendly.  The problems I have aren't with them or the taste of the food, it's just the system that they have set up at Paradise.  I go in the mornings and nearly everyone stops at the bagels/coffee cashier.  The line can be 5 or 6 people deep at times.  They usually just have 2 people handling the area which isn't that bad, but if you look to your right you see an army of employees doing prep work in the salad/lunch area.  Why not give one employee the ability to hop over and help out the area that's busy during a rush?  It's frustrating to see 90% of the customers in one area and 90% of the employees in another area.  Unless you're the first one to use a table/booth in the morning, be prepared to bus and wipe down your own table before using it.  The place is kid friendly, so if you get a booth be prepared to wipe the crumbs off the seat, too.  Like with the other things, it appears it's a management issue and not an employee choice.  Parking....  It's as bad as everyone says.  The center is severely under parked and trucks will often clog up the rear alley for deliveries.  If you go during a busy time it's not surprising to find no parking available....at all.  Those are the negatives and they can sometimes hit you all at once.  It takes a while to find a parking spot, you get inside and have to wait for a simple coffee, then you have to clean your own table before using it. Not good.    That being said, if you know when to go and what to do then it's a great option....heh.  I go in the very early morning so everything is clean and there aren't any lines.  Parking is a breeze.  Every booth has a power outlet so you can bring your laptop, get comfortable, and spread out.  Free refills on coffee and soda and you can choose your own, plus the cream/milk are always filled.  The bagels are great, so are the sweets.  Really friendly staff, free wifi.  The odd thing is that if you show up 2 hours later you might have a completely different experience....

I decided to give this place 5 stars not because it's the best breakfast I've ever had, but their style and food really make it an overall nice experience.  We arrived on a Saturday morning and there was a small line at the door.  The place is big with plenty of tables so we probably waited less than 10 minutes.  Lots of open space, plenty of tables, TVs, seems really modern for a breakfast joint.  I ordered the breakfast burrito which was excellent.  Very unique and didn't depend on a lot of grease for flavor.  My sister got the Eggs Benedict which she also enjoyed.  Had this been a lunch place I would have given it 4 stars, but it just stood out as a unique place to me for breakfast.  Very good menu choices, friendly staff, easy parking, reasonably priced.  If you're looking for something different from the typical breakfast place then give it a try.

One of the best pizzas I've ever had.  I read a lot of the reviews so I was worried about the service, but I had no problems.  I was the only one in the "eating area" so maybe it's hit and miss depending on how busy they are, but the waitress came fast, the food came fast, and she came back often.  I ordered a Wee pepperoni/sausage and it was exactly the type of pizza I like.  The cheese stretches out, the crust has a crispy outer texture but is softer inside, and the sausage is the crumbled kind, not the Domino's type nuggets.  I'm not a huge red sauce fan but I didn't even notice it.  I got the wings (naked) with the suicide sauce on the side.  People are right when they say it's spicy but it doesn't stay with you.  I'm guessing it's habenero.     The total for the pizza, 10 wings, and a soda was $22.  I managed to get through about half of it and I'm a pretty big eater.  I'm definitely going to go back when I return to Vegas in the future.  Everyone has different tastes in pizza, and if this is the style you like, you're going to love it.

Big disclaimer about this review.....  I was finishing up my meal when I saw the waitress bring a bottle of red sauce and a bottle of green sauce to the condiment area.  Apparently, they have 4 bottles for the entire restaurant and a couple of customers decided to bring them to their table.  I didn't know that.  Chips/salsa are $2.49 and they charge for pico so I passed on both.  That being said, you're about to read a review for a Mexican food with no pico, no salsa, no red sauce, and no green sauce.    I ordered the "Choose 3" meal and got one asada, one carnitas, and one fish taco.  The meal option adds rice and beans.  All 3 were a bit dry (see above).  They just don't naturally come with a lot of wetness.  They have jalapenos and lime in the condiment area, but they are stored uncovered and they were dry as well.  The tacos were a little too bland for my taste, especially the fish taco.  The rice and beans are average.  The total was $7.12 but I did not get a drink.  I'm a "sauce whore" at Mexican restaurants so you can take or leave my opinion on the food.  I'm used to having plenty to spread around and it's a bit of a turn-off to have to pay extra for it.  Overall, the place is nice.  The service is friendly.  The food comes fast.  But it seems they need to choose whether they want to be a "street taco" kind of place or a regular Mexican restaurant.  If you order a 3-taco set, plus the chips/salsa, plus the pico, plus a drink, you're going to be close to $15 for your meal served on plastic plates.  For that price I'd probably go to more of a sit-down restaurant with a full menu.  I'll give them another try when they have their "taco Tuesday" special where you can get them for $1 each.  And hopefully the sauce bottles will be available....

I don't have any chronic pain but I do have a foot that swings out to the side when I walk so a friend recommended that I try a chiropractor.  The staff and the doc were friendly.  He listened to what I had to say then made some stretching recommendations to correct my foot.  His recommendations were in line with what my masseuse said as well.  He did the adjustment and was professional.  I told him that I wanted to see how I felt the next day so I didn't want to purchase the package and there was absolutely no pressure to upsell.  In the end I decided to just stick with massage, but the professional recommendations and the lack of pressure to upsell should be noted.  Good service overall for those who want to check out a new chiropractor.

I don't expect much from buffets but there is a kind of minimum standard that you need to be above.  That being said, Mandarin didn't cut it.  The place does have freshness issues.  I made a decent enough taco but the salsa was obviously old.  When that's one of the first things you taste, it makes you a bit skeptical about everything else.  No rice cooker?  The white rice is put into a smallish bin that's usually low in supply.  The fried rice has an artificial look about it (bright colors?) and doesn't have much in the way of taste.  You don't have to have the best fried rice in the world but in the buffet game you have to make sure you don't have the worst.    Lots of chicken dishes, but I made the mistake of biting into a big piece that had lost most of it's coating, and it was a bland experience.  The kind of bland where it makes you think about how processed this food is.  Not a good reminder while eating.  The pizza just looks bad, the kind where the red sauce is just drying away.  I have such a low threshold on pizza quality that Totino's gets me excited, but what I saw at Mandarin didn't make me want to allocate calories to it.  I did try the famous tamale and it reminded me of the Hormel canned tamales.  Just reminder after reminder of the processed food....  Clean place, nice staff, fast seating, parking kind of sucks if the spots right out front are all taken.  At the end of the day there weren't those 1 or 2 go-to dishes that would make me want to return.

I really like this place.  It's a nice, old-fashioned local pizza shop.  I got the slice special which is big enough to feed 2.  It comes with a handy pizza cutter.  All of the ingredients have a lot of flavor.  They use the crumbled sausage instead of the little nuggets that the national companies use.    The crust is thinner under the pizza, but thicker on the edges.  They coat it with a garlic butter that makes it taste like garlic bread.  Very good texture, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  It really adds a nice touch.  Easy to find, really easy parking, free refills on soda, very friendly staff.  It's one of those local shops you want to see succeed so give them a try if you're in the area.

You just have to meet a certain minimum standard to get me in the door to a buffet, and this one didn't live up to it.  It has an old, tired feel to it and it doesn't reflect well on the food.  The restaurant had a kind of humidity to it which again just didn't make anything feel fresh.  The taste wasn't bad, the selection wasn't bad, they just need to do more with the presentation and atmosphere.

Everyone knows about Rudy's, but a lot of people don't know they are open for breakfast at 7 AM.  They have rows of prepared breakfast tacos, no waiting at all.  Just grab the ones you want, pay, and eat there or take it with you.  They have brisket tacos, jalapeno sausage tacos, plus the regulars like sausage/bacon and even fresh green and red salsa to add.  The flour tortillas stay soft and warm and melt into the taste of the meats.

I've been here a half dozen times but I've never had a problem with the service.  Overall your typical bagel shop.  It's attached to Capriotti's with an opening between the two stores.  The bagels are a bit smaller in diameter but they are thick for their size.  You don't have to worry about getting a scrawny end of batch bagel that is an inch thick on one side and paper thin on another (looking at you, Paradise Cafe).  You also get more of the chewiness of the bagel.  The place could probably stand to add a few more cheeses to the mix, preferably a chive option.  I've really only tried their regular bagels and the sausage/egg/cheese breakfast bagel (see enclosed pic).  The pork could have used more flavor; I'm not sure the sandwich really stands up on it's own.  Since it's rare I order things like this my review is mostly for the regular bagels.  I go there at odd times so no problems waiting in line, ordering, or parking.    Quick Tip:  The bagel part of the shop closes at 11 AM and you can buy "end of day bagels" from a rack in Capriotti's.  Stop by at 11:30 AM and you can get a half-dozen bagels for $2.50 and they aren't nearly as old as other end of day bagel shops.

Great place to grab a burger with the family or alone.  The Good:  Easy to find, good parking.  Inside is clean and cute.  Lots of staff there to help with anything you need.  It's one of those classic, limited menus that stood the test of time.    The food has a really nice presentation to it.  See my pic and others.  Everything looks fresh and the burger is carefully wrapped.  Lot's of attention to detail.  There is a SNAP when you bite through the fresh veggies.  The taco is a nice change, try it once.  A burger, taco, and large drink is $11 and change.  The bad:  Well, unfortunately, I just didn't like the taste of the burger that much.  It's not bad by any means, just not on my tops list.  The combination of spices just didn't hit me the right way, and I didn't get as much veggie taste as I would have liked.  The bun was dry, cracking up a little as I got more into the burger.  That being said, it's still a nice place.  Everyone else seems to like it so maybe it's just my palette.  Everything else about the place is good so I have no problem recommending it.

Food with flair and flavor, good atmosphere, easy parking, overall a good experience.  First of all, it's a very comfortable place.  Lots of natural lighting, an open design, large booths, and plenty of space.  I brought my tablet with me and ended up staying for quite a while.  The staff were friendly and attentive.    I ordered the half serving of the guac and chips.  Really nice flavor overall and the chips are the harder, fresh kind that I usually get at a local Mexican grocery.  The ice tea (can't remember the name, but similar to passion fruit) had a subtle taste to it which I like.  Sometimes people go overboard with flavoring tea....  I got the carne asada taco and the carnitas taco.  The carnitas came with pineapple which had a nice balance to it.  The carne asada was good as well and the fresh, hot tortilla made everything kind of melt in your mouth.  One note:  The meats weren't particularly hot so I'm guessing it was scooped from a bin.  It probably could have used 30 seconds on the flat top.   I went during Happy Hour and each item was reduced by $1 so the total damage was $12.06, or $15 with tip.  Plenty of food (and refills) for a very lazy lunch day.

This place has a bit of an awkward branding, but I really enjoyed it.  If you're not in the mood for the $12 "gourmet" burgers at the other places then give this one a try.  It's more like an old school diner with smallish burgers that are $2.65 each.  Nothing fancy, just basic, and really good taste.  I also got the gyro which was the same.  Very good, classic taste overall.    The gyro, cheeseburger, and free refill drink (no fries or extras) came to $11.07.  Friendly staff, easy parking, big tables.  Give this place a try if you want a simple lunch or dinner that's tasty but won't break the bank.

Nice down-home place.  I got the sampler and chose the sausage link, brisket, and ribs.  I'm a big brisket fan but the sausage stole the show here.  It had a softer, more uniform texture inside and it falls apart in your mouth.  Juicy without being greasy.  Really well done.    The brisket was good and the ribs were really, really tender.  When I left I didn't have the usual "heavy" feeling that you get from BBQ.    One thing I didn't try (but wanted to) was the cheesecake jar.  I included a picture of it.  Very friendly staff, clean, easy to order, fast, and the tax is included.  They also have drive-thru.

Loved it.  FYI, the food really can be spicy which I enjoy.  If it's your first time here you might want to go lower than you normally do.  I like it extra spicy so it was fine for me.  Excellent flavor overall.  I was really looking to fill the need for some red curry and it hit the spot.

Great place overall.  It's hard to go to a pizza shop when I'm eating alone (usually $20, 3000+ calories), but they have a good system in place.  Tons of space inside.  Very easy parking.  It's in the center where you'll find Starbucks, The Good Egg, etc.  To be honest I was going to the Good Egg and saw your sign and realized you were one of my bookmarks.  The restaurant can't be seen from the street or even the parking lot.  I'm glad I changed my mind and went here.  The service was very friendly from all of the staff.  The pizza was $7.95 and it's more than enough for one person.  It could feed two and it's a great price if you choose that route.  I'll take my nieces here and have them split one and feed 2 hungry kids for $4 each plus drinks.  I ordered the Meaty Italian (pic enclosed).  I ordered, got my drink, went to the little island to grab some parm and peppers, say down, took out my tablet, and by then the pizza was ready.  Probably under 5 minutes.  Very fresh and hard to believe it was that fast.  Despite the low price they offered to put anything else on it that I wanted so I chose the sweet peppers.  Same price, which is nice because I hate it when you order a pizza and the toppings double the price.  The place was clean, they serve fountain drinks so you can refill, and the decor was modern.  If you want to grab a pizza and not break the bank and maybe get 2 meals out of it, check out this place.

Trinity was what I was looking for so I was very happy with the experience overall.  Her office is a really unique, peaceful place.  Good parking and shady trees all around.  It helps you get into a good mood to help the massage.  I've enclosed a picture. The inside of her studio is nice and professional.  She did a good job of listening to what I wanted before the massage and then working it into her routine.  One thing that will get a masseuse off my list in a hurry is when they ask what areas I want, then just give me the regular all body massage.  The oil is very light and non-scented.  She puts it on the areas she is working on which is nice since the others just tend to oil everything up just for the sake of it.  There's no wipe-down after, and I had the massage about 2 hours ago and I can only feel minimal oil still on my body.  I asked for very hard pressure and she has great technique.  I've had so many massages and I've learned how I like to feel pressure.  She used the technique with her elbow/forearm which is my favorite.  She's also good at kind of circling in on an area and then increasing the pressure when she starts to focus in on one specific spot.  It eases you into the harder pressure and raises your tolerance a bit.  When you get deep tissue massages it's a fine line between not enough pressure and too much and she found my level pretty quickly.  Overall she's a great balance between personalization and professionalism.  It's hard to find that.  If you go to a shop you get set hours and it's run like a business which is good, but it's hard to keep the same masseuse since they leave so often.  I like the more personal approach with people that work out of their homes but they can be flaky and work only when they want to.  Trinity gives you the best of both!

Great place and great food overall.  I usually don't hand out 5 starts but the sandwich was pretty damn good.  Really easy parking and access off the 60, friendly staff, massive menu, good seating, free refills, etc.  The bread I chose was the Dutch crunch which has a crunchy, buttery top that meshes well with the sandwich.  I chose the Barry B which has turkey, bacon, and Swiss cheese.  Really nice balance to everything.  The bread had a nice crunch on top but if soft on the inside so it doesn't feel hard.    The sandwich and drink were $11 and change, plus I threw in a $1 tip.  I skipped the chips to save money and the sandwich was be enough to just eat half if you aren't very hungry.  I ended up eating the whole thing.  Like I said the menu is massive so you might want to take a look before going in there.  They also gave out a free caramel/apple sucker which was also damn good.

It's a 5-star concept and execution with 3.5-star food.  If you have a bad meal at this place it's likely that it's your own fault.  They have 7 or 8 different proteins that you can choose for a base and you can try all of them before you decide.  I picked 3 for the tacos and after a couple of minutes of grill work we were on to the toppings.  You can choose from the staples of Mexican food:  cilantro, onion, tomato, guac, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, tomatoes, etc.  After that you can try 3 different salsas from the bar plus some limes and jalapenos.  What this place has is balance.  It doesn't overwhelm you with so many choices that you never know if you got the best choice, but it has enough choice where you can get variety.  Granted, it probably won't be the best taco you've ever had in Phoenix.  But you can choose what you want based on your mood, and it will be good.  I love salsa but some places go overboard by giving you so many salsa choices that you just end of trying all of them and deciding after-the-fact which one you liked best.  It's also a great place for a lot of different people, important if you have a diverse crowd.  You can get veggie options, meat options, salads, burritos or tacos, big or small.   Now for the other stuff...  The booth probably had the softest and most comfortable seat I've ever had in a booth.  I don't go around rating seats but it was so comfy I actually noticed it.  The table was very clean, and so was the salsa bar.  Free drink refills.  Napkins at the table.  Open seating area that's set apart from the grill area.  Clean floors, clean everything.  Very easy parking and very easy to find.  Friendly service.  Mostly middle class people eating at 5:30 PM.  You can pull tables together for a larger group or have a somewhat intimate conversation in a booth.  Prep is fast.  If you need to recommend a place for lunch with a larger group of people then this is a great choice.  Or just stop by yourself, grab 3 tacos, and make them how you want.

I've seen some reviews from New Yorkers who say this is what they are used to.  The concept is difficult for me to get so I'll defer to their experience.  This place might be a good indicator about what the 7th Street corridor is becoming.  Lots of good places to eat with most of them being unique.  It's hard to think of this little strip center being a destination for food, but with Chen Wok and The Italian Spoon you can make a case that it's at least a great option for lunch.  LaBella is a pretty big step up so it will be interesting to see how it does.  Nice, open design which feels more upscale.  At the register you are hit with fresh slice pizzas, fresh sushi, and fresh baked items.  I went in for a couple of slices but had to backtrack for a bit and take a look at what they had to offer.  It definitely puts you in the mood for eating.  As for the food....  I got a slice of stuffed (cheese) crust cheese and a slice of the pesto.  Both are good, adding a kind of uniqueness to the typical pizza experience.  The bread on the stuffed crust is fresh and they add spices that mix well with the cheese inside.  I enclosed a picture; the pizza is a bit darker because I asked the guy to heat it for a couple of extra minutes.  The thin pesto was good but I'm just not much of a thin crust guy and this was one of the thinnest pizzas I've ever had.  The flavor was unique so I could appreciate that.  I just need a little something more to bite my teeth into.  Two slices and a coke was just under $10.  I get the feeling that this place will have quite a few more hits than misses so check it out if you get the chance.  Review the menu before you go because they have a very large selection catering to a lot of moods.  You can have a simple slice of cheese all the way up to $20 grilled fish.

I kind of oscillated between 3 and 4 stars, and decided on 4 stars for the overall experience.  The food overall was probably 3 stars.  Very nice shop.  Nice and clean, modern, and a very friendly lady working at the counter.  Free WiFi, too.  I asked a couple of questions about the menu and she gave me the info I needed, then I ordered.  I got the gyro with a side salad and a drink, all for $10.77.  Good price.  Free refills on sodas with a self-serve fountain station.  Plenty of extra parking behind the store with a rear entrance.  One thing I wish it had more of was sauce, both for the salad and the cucumber sauce for the gyro.  Everything tasted fine but I did wish I had asked for some extra on the side.  The gyro itself is typical, but I'm a bit spoiled.  My favorite place has large, soft strips of meat so I'm a bit disappointed by the places that serve the thinner, harder strips.  It tends to make the dish feel a bit average.  If you want to stand out you have to do something different.  But like I said, the place and experience was good overall.  I enjoyed eating there and I'll return.

I was surprised that I hadn't written a review for this place.  I've been here at least a dozen times in the last year or so.  It's a great place, friendly staff, easy parking, convenient location, free refills on sodas.  I've really only had the Barry B which is a turkey/swiss/bacon sandwich because I ordered it the first time I came in and never changed.    Their menu selection is just huge with lots of unique sandwiches.  Get the Dutch crunch bread with the crunchy, buttery top.  I think it's probably the best sandwich bread I've ever had.  Expect to pay about $10-$15 for a sandwich, chips and a drink.  Forgot to add:  I went in recently for their breakfast sandwiches.  Try The Hangover.  Eggs, your choice of meat, cheese, tater tots, and a really spicy hot sauce.

Just a quickie here....  This is a new option that's worth checking out.  I got the caprese sandwich.  I tend to like a stronger pesto/motz combo.  I've ordered a caprese salad probably a hundred times and I've learned that my own personal preference is for a very strong taste.  I don't hold stuff like this against a restaurant because it really does come down to personal preference.  It's fresh and well prepared.  Easy parking, easy to find, has a nice little couch area if you want to relax a bit, and it also has some tables outside under shady trees.  Seems like a nice place to get lost in for an hour or so.

Finally I can get kaiten sushi and not have to drive 15 miles to the outskirts of Phoenix....  I used to live in Japan so this is a bit like going home for me.  This place could easily be dropped in a Japanese city and would fit in.    I ended up getting the fried rice and tried a couple of plates of sushi.  Both were good, and the last time I was here the sushi was good as well.  The ebi (shrimp) is exactly like I used to have it in Japan.  I opted for the California roll this time around (easy way out) since I was doing some reading and didn't much feel like prepping each piece of sushi with wasabi and ginger.  The food was more than enough, plus a large drink put the total at $11.34.  Very, very friendly staff, easy location, easy parking, easy ordering and eating.

I'll give it 4 stars.  It seems there's not really an Asian market to satisfy everyone, but this is probably the closest that it gets.  It's a huge store.  Large enough to find the little things that you might want, plus you can browse for something new to try.  They also have a section with traditional American grocery items if you need to pick up some Prego with your Pokki.  I'm a bit picky about my fresh meat and vegetables so I might stay with the other shops for those items.  Really convenient location, endless parking, clean store.
