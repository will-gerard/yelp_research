Typical prepared, previously frozen bar food. There's absolutely NOTHING about this place that's even close to above average. I think the lack of options in Anthem is the sole reason this place is open. Keep up the Mediocre work guys. Mediocre food. Mediocre service. Mediocre decor and atmosphere. If the new owners are striving for 2 out of 5 stars.... They're  nailing it!!

Good pricing. Good service. Good food. This is a great little neighborhood restaurant and we will definitely be back. The spicy Alfredo with sausage pasta was VERY good. Just the right amount of spice.

Ok.. So I had to call one of my African American friends and ask him "What the HELL is so goddam special about Lo-Los?!!" To which he Literally laughed out loud and said "NOTHING!!"  I knew he would have been and have some type of input. He had, and he did. No! I am not racist or stereotyping anyone! I know he loves Fried chicken and would give me an honest opinion.  He and I both unanimously decided that this place SUCKS. He told me "you should have called me from the parking lot, I would have saved you a bunch of time and aggravation."   This is definitely one of those cases in which you should NEVER believe the hype.    Over priced. $3 for KOOL AID! (Anybody that orders Kool aid for $3... I have some real estate I want to discuss with you) $16 for dry flavorless chicken and cinnamon waffles. Gimme a break. I can get an entire family meal of chicken at KFC for less than that! And the KFC actually is juicy and has flavor!  The fried chicken is flavorless. Seriously. Its like flour and a dash of salt. Thats it. NO seasonings at all. They talk about passing down recipes for generations and generation...? WHaaaaaa?  I wonder if while the recipe was being passed down, they deleted the spices to save money on the overpriced food they are selling to us bamboozled people out there... It honestly tastes like fried chicken from a Lubys cafeteria thats specifically cooked to cater to the older folks on restricted diets.   The waffles were yummy. I will give em that. Cornbread was dry.   It took over 30 minutes to get a burger. The rest of the meal came out in parts. They forgot some of it altogether till we asked for it.   This place sucks. Seriously. Its much to do about NOTHING.   I recommend a name change. Lo-Lo's Hi-Hi. Low low quality and high high prices.

I have been using one body shop for the last 20 years. (Yes, I wreck cars like most people have home-cooked breakfasts... its my cross to bear.) When that body shop owner made it pretty clear by his "customer service" that he was on his last leg in the business, I was actually pretty stressed out knowing that I needed to find another shop to use as the likely-hood of me wrecking more cars in addition to my already busted ass Acura was a virtual certainty and my 20 year relationship with one body shop was just flushed down the toilet. (Yes, I know, run on sentence. What are you a grammar Nazi?!) I looked to Yelp, found that Scott's Coach works looked pretty good... tried them, BAD DEAL, (see other review) so I went to Select Auto Body.  I am SOOO happy with Bud (Owner) and the service at Select Auto Body so far. He has been awesome. Fixed my car. Fixed what I wanted and nothing I didn't want, has been helpful. Has been excellent with communication.   Very happy and I know that I have a new body shop to take my cars to going forward. Thanks so Much Bud!

I took my car to Scotts because of the yelp reviews. I am shocked at how they do business. Appalled actually.  I made the mistake of calling the day before to ask if they do any type of deductible waiving like so many body shops are advertising. They made it perfectly clear that thats NOT an option.Because getting my car fixed was the most important, I brought them my car anyways. My insurance company came out and wrote an estimate to include a few repairs to the A pillar and roof of my car. Damage as a result of the accident that I didn't even see. I went in to discuss the estimate with Matt (estimator) and thats when all hell broke loose.  I further made a mistake in asking why I was being charged full retail for all the parts when they were available all over the internet at wholesale prices. DO NOT DARE ASK THESE GUYS FOR ANY BREAKS.   When I informed Matt that I had no desire to repair the VERY minor damage to my cars roof because of the nature of the use of my car, they refused my wishes saying that they are going to fix everything on the estimate despite me, the OWNER and CUSTOMER requesting those items NOT to be fixed. I didn't see the point in fixing very minor, almost unnoticeable damage to a 9 year old 100k mile car that I plan on driving till 200k miles when the car will be near worthless, irrelevant of how perfect the body is. My request was simply unacceptable to them. The manager came in to continue to argue with me that they were not going to fix what I ASKED THEM TO FIX and that they were going to fix everything THEY wanted. (Note. I own the car outright. Dont have a lien holder that required the asset to be repaired at all.)   Scotts is ALL ABOUT THE MONEY. They want to milk every dime out of an estimate and even told me immediately upon arrival that they were going to need to supplement my insurance company stating "this estimate isn't even close to whats needed."   When I realized that no matter what I said, and no matter what I wanted as the owner of the car and customer, that they were going to fight to squeeze every dollar out of the estimate including fix damage I didnt want touched, I requested to remove my car from their possession.   I took my car out of there, drove it across the street to Select Auto Body. (VERY HIGH reviews on Yelp) where I talked to Bud. He said he would be happy to work with my insurance company to fix everything that I WANTED FIXED the right way and nothing I didn't want fixed.   Appalling at how this company does NOT listen to what a customer wants at all. It was Scotts Coach Works way or NO WAY. Well, thats not how I do business and thats not how I treat the customers that I have in my career.    In response to Stephanies attempt to cover up their crap customer service.... My car is a 2005 Acura RL. Its 9 years old and has almost 100k miles on it. I own it outright.    1. I asked why ACURA parts sold by an ACURA dealership online for 20% less couldn't be used. Not no-name untrusted parts from shady sources like she leads to believe. Their guy explained they make money buying parts wholesale and selling retail. I dropped the subject. We moved on.  2. I had minor scratches on the roof of my car and slightly rippled metal near the moonroof. NOT something that needs to be repaired for the value of the car, the drive-ability, the looks etc etc. I didnt even see them initially. It wasnt even till I saw the insurance adjusters estimate with some roof repairs on it that I asked to see them and then after determining that repairing them wasn't worthwhile due to the age of the car and the value I requested that  SCW NOT fix them and thats when the problem began.   3. When you own a car outright, and file an insurance claim, the insurance company is required to return you to "pre accident condition" financially. Meaning.... If your car has $5000 worth of damage done to it, and you find somebody to fix it for $4000, then you get to keep the change. Legally. So again, Stephanie saying that the customer doesnt get to "keep the profit" is a lie. Her trying to make excuses for CRAP customer service.   After arguing with the service writer, telling him that I don't care what he says, I didnt want the minor scratches removed and roof repairs done, and then he went and got his boss to come in and tell me the same BS , i demanded my car be removed from SCW as I am the customer, the owner of the car and I am the one that tells a body shop what to fix, not the other way around.   Bottom line... Scotts will repair your car THEIR way, or no way. Dont DARE ask them for a discount or request them to repair or not to repair ANYTHING. Simply go in to SCW with your head bowed and your checkbook open and ask them nicely if they would be so kind as to work on your car pretty please, and you will get along with them just fine.

1988 called, they want their old ass, outdated, cheap garbage pretend brick sheet paneling and pathetic NY Plastic covered art work that wouldn't look good in a garage back.   Seriously. This place is dark. Musty. STILL Smells from when smoking inside was legal. The exterior is worn. The landscape is tired and needs help. Theres NOTHING inviting about the exterior of this restaurant at all. The interior is WORSE. Deep fried breaded wings that turn to mush. Yummmmm.. (I think I just threw up a little in my mouth)  The owner needs to wake up. The hey day of NNY is OVER.   DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. Travel another 500 feet to Santisi brothers in the same parking lot by the sticky floor cinemas and walk into a place with like 400 TVs all streaming everything you could imagine. Cute friendly waitresses. GREAT food. NON breaded wings. And NO. I dont work for Santisi. Its just a much better place. Seriously. Its actually what NNY wishes it was.

This place reminds me of a push up bra.   A lot of hype and build up only to find just boobs underneath. Or in this case, JUST Mexican food. I mean... The food is good. Like all Mexican food places. It's all cooked by Mexicans so how Much better can one place be over another?   Tiny tables. Loud as hell. Dated decor. Decent value on the food unless you ask for a side of sour cream. HOLY BALLS!! $2.75 for a side of sour cream?! Really!!!?   I don't give a rats ass if every president that's still burning oxygen has eaten there... It really is like..."meh" if you ask me.

Disgusting.    All of the print ads this "resort" has is totally misleading and false advertising.   We went on 4th of July weekend. The place was packed and gross. The grounds weren't kept up. Our room had roaches. The pool area was ICK!   The place is extremely dated. Needs rehab. The food at their on site restaurants is sub standard at best. Frozen food thats cooked. Tasteless. Service was blah at best.   The Hilton name would be ashamed if they knew how this dump was being run. Shame on management.

October of 2013 I brought home a baby Yorkie. I knew going forward that I was going to be getting her groomed roughly every 7-8 weeks for the rest Of her life. After trying Petsmart, Petco, My veterinarians grooming department, and another place that was grinding her nails down to the point of bleeding, I finally found this place. Thank god almighty. The lady that owns this joint is a real class act. Not only did she make my tiny little dog look soooo cute, but she actually took the time to talk to me and reassure me that she would do a great job. She effing nailed it. Love this place. Love their work. Will not only go back but I will refer this place every chance I get. Yelp reviews is why I tried this groomer in the first place and I am so happy I did! You will be too!

Seriously!! $6.25 for two slices of paper thin cheese pizza that's godonlyknowshowold and a soda? You can get two slices of specialty pizza at barros for $2.00 less. Get real Rays. It's not a steak sandwich. I bought my daughter and her friend a combo and another single slice and the charge was $16.50!!! Wtf?! I will never be back ever.

I bought a car from the a man that I was told is a PART OWNER  of this shop, NOT an employee. The car had a salvaged title and was rebuilt after the collision by this body shop. While I LOVE THIS CAR and have ZERO buyers remorse as mentioned by the tirade of excuses published below by the owner of this place. KK bought the car from an insurance auction. Rebuilt it, drove it for 2 years and sold it to me. Part of the conditions of this sale was they were to remedy some damage on the vehicle on the rear right door. When KK took the car in to do this contractually obligated repair, they did a shitty job. Spot fixed it. It stood out like a sore thumb.  After I bought the car I further  found out that the car will never be able to be aligned because the sub frame is bent and should have been replaced from the major collision that totaled it. I had TWO other body shops confirm this. Below I am accused of wrecking it myself. The truth is, I thought the car needed alignment and I would handle it when I put new tires on the car. When I did, the tire shop showed me from underneath how the car subframe was shifted so I took it to the body shops to confirm. Bottom line, corners were cut to repair the vehicle from the original collision. then when further paint repairs were to be done per the deal, they cut more corners by attempting to repair the work the cheapest way humanly possible and then lying about how the work was done and making excuses for the poor quality work.  Instead of bringing the car back AGAIN, I took it to another shop. ASK YOURSELF THIS..... HOW MANY OTHER REPAIR JOBS, EVEN YOUR OWN, WILL BE DONE HALF ASSED BECAUSE YOU WONT EVER FIND OUT UNTIL MUCH LATER OR AT ALL.  THE OWNERS BULLSHIT EXCUSES FURTHER SOLIDIFY HIS ATTITUDE THAT HES RIGHT, AND CUSTOMERS ARE WRONG. Seriously I would pick another body shop. Plenty out there to choose from. Hell, even plenty within a 3 minute walk from this place. This shop simply doesn't believe in doing it right the first time. Save yourself the drama. ***** IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SHITTY WORK THIS PLACE PUSHES OUT, GET IN TOUCH, IM HAPPY TO SHOW YOU THE PAINTWORK ON THE FRONT END OF MY CAR. *********

Ok.... So the only reason I even went to this place was because I didn't want to re-park my car after I found out "Cartel" was a breakfast joint.... In hindsight, I should have re parked my car.   This place is so very amazingly and exceptionally average. As in like, my stomach was full but not because the food was so good I couldn't help but to eat every last bite, as much it was because I only had an hour for lunch. Wife ordered a "tortilla soup" and some type of healthy rice and grilled veggie meal. The soup was barely edible (salty, over spiced and FULL of corn) and the rice was reheated from cold storage and the grilled veggies were soggy. My Reuben was edible. That's about where that stops but for full disclosure purposes, I'm a bit of a Reuben snob. (See former reviews of the Reuben at Windsor) My daughters burger was meh. Fries and tater toys were deep fried in the same grease that was not only old and badly needed to be changed but also used to fry the fish they were serving for the fish and chips. Gross!! Fishy tasting fries!    Service was below average. Waitress not only had a huge case of the "idontgivadamns" but wasn't anywhere to be found except to drop off food and take Initial order.  Decor was dated. I could go on and on. I won't return and I highly recommend going anywhere else downtown besides this place. Hell, the hot dog guy on the corner of Jefferson and central is a 100% improvement from this joint.

I wonder if the reason why this theater is about 60% empty (less than half of the 30 theaters being used) is because of the offensive ticket and concession prices. Harkins  is always busy and this place is always dead. If it wasn't for IMAX, this place would be out of business.

Very cool place. My kids love it. Lots of climbing options.   A bit of a note to the owner.... Your place is filthy. There's no reason why you couldn't have clean bathrooms and sweep and throw away garbage that's laying around. It's really bad. Clean glass. Sweep up. Throw away garbage. Dust a little. Get rid of cob webs you have. Show a little pride in your business.

Went for lunch yesterday..... As far as the food was concerned, it was average. Nothing special at all. The Fruit-ke-bob was a cool idea as a side, and the seasoned waffle frys were yummy, but neither were very innovative and amazing. The Reuben was thick sliced corned beef and thousand Island on Marble rye. Big whoop. (Couldn't carry the lunchbox of the Rueben at Windsor, see my review of that)  Atmosphere.. dark and closed off. Could let more light in for the lunch crowd. Service, my waiter acted like he would prefer to be anywhere else in the world. Common for servers, as I was one once myself way back when I was a little girl, but he did a poor job of hiding his true sentiment to his job.  What REALLY took me back about this place was that there was a patron that literally passed out on the floor (unrelated medical issue) and the restaurant staff did NOTHING to help her. Absolutely NOTHING. The bartender dropped off a glass of OJ with simple syrup in it and walked away. No cold rag, no offer of assistance, no compassion or concern whatsoever. Heres your glass of OJ, good luck with that...type attitude. I really couldn't believe that.   As a result of that alone, I would never spend another dollar in an establishment that shows ZERO level of concern for a patron that passes out and is laying on the floor and the staff does nothing.

1. Service is adequate. Not great mind you, just adequate. 2. Food is tasty.  3. Prices are stupid. Its pizza and sandwiches folks. Give me a break with some of these prices! 4. If you go, go during happy hour. Then the prices wont bother you.  I have gone a couple times and each time I go, I ask myself, why. I guess Norterra area needs more options.

I have used Todd on at least a dozen occasions. I am a property investor and I buy multiple homes. I need Todd for EVERY house I do and he is ALWAYS there for me. He even got me into my own car once. At the drop of a hat, he is there for me. His knowledge is excellent, his demeanor is fantastic and his service and workmanship is excellent. I would NEVER use another locksmith unless he was dead or out of town. In which case I would probably ask him to come home. :) Use this guy. Hes great.

Yeah.. .I read a few of the reviews and while I certainly am in no position to validate them, some seem pretty far fetched....  As for me... I am VERY happy with this place. Shawn the GM always takes great care of me. I am able to get things done quickly and efficiantly. They have sold me tires and warranted them when needed. They have done oil changes and tire rotations etc etc on all my cars and I have 4 of them.   Never an issue.   Thanks Guys!

I went with a friend today. We had our girls and thought we would try a small family place instead of the Subway in the same strip mall. Support local businesses right? Mistake.  Ordered chicken fingers off kids menu for my little ones to split. Eating too much at 3pm spoils dinner. For $5.95 I got two previously frozen processed chicken finger planks and some crinkle cut fries. Pathetic. Buddy ordered a $4.50 bowl of Kraft Mac and cheese for his kid. Absurd.   I ordered a cheeseburger. Cant possibly go wrong with that right? What I got was a previously frozen pattie of tasteless meat that had two slices of barely melted processed cheese on it. Took three bites and sent it back. Waitress seemed offended personally when I said it tasted like garbage. $9.70 for a garbage cheeseburger. Honestly, a Whopper is a better tasting burger. The lettuce was shredded and browned limp iceburg the bun was soggy, etc etc. It was a train-wreck.   My friend ordered the chicken fajitas and said they were VERY good. I didn't taste them, but Ill take his word for it.   Terrible value.  Service was mediocre. (I watched a blonde haired waitress literally twirling her pony tail while she was talking to a table. You cant make this crap up)  Their receipts say "Best Mexican food in Anthem." Bullshit.   Tighten up your act 8 Crazies. Your food is crap. Your prices are ABSURD. Your reviews here should be a wake up call.

OMG. Soooooooo good.  Things you must try while here.... 1. Table side mozzarella. Appetizer for 2. Divine. Seriously, really effing good. I'm not kidding.  2. The grilled bone in pork chop. It's a meal for two unless you're VERY hungry. Now I for one am a guy that likes chunks of meat with a bone sticking out of it. This chop nails it.   Beautiful restaurant. Fantastic food. Server was AMAZEBALLS. He had a brain fart tho. (Wrote that in there for his benefit, good job Tyler. Thanks for the oranges)   All in all, go here. Eat. Then tell me I was right.

The Rueben.   Seriously. If you like Reubens.... Let me say this. This sandwich is like sex in your mouth. And not just regular sex. GREAT sex. Seriously.   The cassette tapes are cool as well. Like taking a walk down musical memory lane every time I need to pee.

One star is too many.   I brought my Yorkie here for grooming. Once. When I returned to get her, the groomer was in the process of finishing up. My dog was screaming at the top of her lungs in pain because he was grinding her nails down. When I asked him "wtf?" His response was "all dogs hate this... It's normal." When he stopped he handed her to me... And she was bleeding from her paws all over my shirt. He had ground her nails down to the quick and she wasn't screaming from "hating" the process... She was screaming in actual agony from getting her nails ground down.   I asked for the manager. She wasn't available. When I asked for a phone call, that never happened. When I called back... Still not available.   Accidents happen. I get it. But when a dog is screaming , that means they are in pain and you should stop what you're doing.   Sooooo pissed. Wouldn't recommend this place. There's another place across the street next to Valle' Luna. MUCH BETTER.   Regarding the patronizing response below.....  You should have called me when I requested it months ago. Trying to save face after the fact on yelp is cowardly.   Seriously folks..... Hot Dogs and Cool Cats is across the street next to Valle Luna. They are 1000% more professional and talented than these hacks.

Ok... So today I went in with my 4lb Yorkie to see the shop and see if there was anything that I had to have for my dog. Initially, the gentleman behind the counter was awesome. Friendly, courteous, engaging and interested in my business and my dog.  We talked about Yorkies and how great they are. He apparently has one and we were talking with another patron about her Yorkie she had as well. It was going very well. I decided to get my dog a doggy cupcake and go on about my day.    At the same time I was checking out another guy walked in with a small dog off the leash. Immediately the guy helping me yelled out "theres a little puppy in here!" at which that instant, that dog rushed in and literally attacked my dog. My dog was bitten on her back and I had to hit the dog to stop it from chewing on mine.   As it turns out, the dog was the owners dog and the guy that walked in was a business partner/owner. My tiny dog was off leash, their dog was off leash. After their dog stopped biting mine one of the guys scooped it up and put it in the back behind a baby gate and I got a "Oh sorry about that, hes just soooo dominant!"   The problem I have is this... If you're aware that your dog is an asshole, why would you have it off the leash?! Especially in a freaking pet shop! And secondly, the best you got is "sorry hes so dominant?"   I was so turned off by this event that I wanted to pay and get the hell out of there. Oh yeah, that kinda pissed me off too... right after this guys little asshole dog just finished biting mine, and shes now trembling in my arms, he hands me a debit card slip to sign for $3.59.  Advice to this new shop... Dont let your little asshole/dominant dog run freely if hes going to attack other peoples little dogs that are smaller than him. People tend not to like it when their little dog gets attacked.   This business gets 2 stars only because its a cute place and right up until the dog fight and the owners lack of what I like to call "give-a-shit-ism" he was very friendly and seemed to care.

I think the food is great. The service I experienced when I went was wonderful. (sat at the bar.) The pork sliders are amaze-balls!  The building, while new is VERY blah. It looks like the owner ran out of money and didnt budget for decor.

After giving this small place my typical 3 at bats before ruling them out, I have had it. Im done. The management is non-existent and when they are around, they dont give a damn about running a restaurant or customer service. The bartender I had last time was a snotty little b**** that acted like I was an inconvenience. Too bad.. the food has been decent each time I went. Its a shame to see a small local place open then start losing it over customer service. The easiest thing to fix. I think the only reason why this place is even still open is lack of options for locals.

Went here last night. I'll review on a few different points.   1.  Service. My guy Nathan was fantastic. He was very attentive and on it. A small delay happened and before I could even bring it to his attention, he noticed and came to the table with a refresh on wine and brought me an amazing cocktail prepared table side. On the house because of the food delay. Fantastic.   2.  Food. Superb. Great tastes and textures. Fantastic mashes of flavors in my entree. I ordered the special. A 18ounce ribeye with a habenero risotto with white beans and homemade sausage and grilled asparagus. Seriously. De-frickin-licious. Spicy but fantastic.   3. Decor/restaurant design. Meh. They tried to be new and hip and trendy but the decor lacks depth and texture. The wall with the painted bookshelves and painted wall sconces on it is awkward and out of place and reminds me of an Olan Mills back set of the cheesy mid 80's family portrait we have all tried so hard to forget ever happened. (Yes, I know. Run on sentance. What are you? THe Yelp grammar police?)  In conclusion, add some design to the building. Change NOTHING else. LOVE this place. Will go back.

Whos got two thumbs and really likes this place.. This guy!  I didnt give it a 5 star because it really takes alot to.... wait. I dont have to justify my Yelps to you or anybody! ;0)  Went with the kiddies. Yummy Guacamole.... (could be a slightly bigger dish.)  Its great place. We had fast service. Pricing is reasonable. Atmosphere was cool. Im a big fan of places that dont have uniforms on the staff. This is one such place.
