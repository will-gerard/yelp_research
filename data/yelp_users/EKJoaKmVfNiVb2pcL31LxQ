I have lived in the valley for 23 years and this was my first time at Rustler's Roost.  I have heard about many times over the years as it is somewhat of a tourist landmark restaurant but never had the opportunity to try it.  The perfect opportunity arose last night when we had family in town and decided to give it a try.  This restaurant is situated at the top of a hill at the Arizona Grand Hotel.  The views are incredible and the feel and theme are really fun especially since we are right of the I-10.  It feels like you are in a small cowboy area in the middle of the city.  This is a family friendly place that is actually really good for kids as it is loud and your little ones won't be bothering anyone.  There is music 7 nights a week and it can be very crowded, despite the fact that the restaurant seats at least 500 not including the patio.  We were able to get a reservation as we were a larger group of 10 so that was nice.  The restaurant is very dim and we needed our smartphone flashlights in order to read them.  Thank goodness for technology.  The menu is what you would expect from a theme steak house.  The usual fare; steaks, chicken and some seafood with the typical side dishes.  I decided on the mixed grill which was very tender filet medallions and you had a choice of another meat and I chose the ribs.  They were also very good and tender.  The side veggie were carrots that were tasty but some were not cooked enough so they were tough.  We also all got cowboy beans (eh) and salad for the table as well as rolls that were kind of yucky.  For dessert, we opted to try the cowpie (how could you not?) which was basically chocolate covered coffee ice cream.  The description definitely sounded better than it tasted but it was ok to satisfy our sweet tooths.  The meals that my family had they enjoyed as well.    This is definitely a place that I would come back to.  I would say it is a place to enjoy with friends or out of town guests if you are looking for something different.

I have been going to Contemporary Care for Women for many years. My Doctor is Dr. Lepetich and I really like him.  I have also seen a couple other docs and PA's there as well over the years.  I will say, I much prefer the Gilbert location over the Tempe location.  I seem to wait a lot longer at the Tempe location.  I would not hesitate to refer anyone to this practice and especially Dr. Lepetich.

I went to this Apple Store because the San Tan location was full with appointments.  I usually prefer the San Tan location as this location is usually EXTREMELY busy.  And it was again.  I had a genius appointment at 5:45 and didn't leave until almost 8pm.  That shows you the kind of problems I was having.    The genius, Dennis, was so nice and really wanted to help me.  He spent well over the alotted time he was supposed to have.  He did need to take a few other appointments while we were working with him but he always came back.  The fix he made on my computer did subsequently cause me further problems but I was able to work most of those out with Apple care today via phone.    This location is very large and somewhat frenzied.  While I still prefer the San Tan location, I have no problem going here as well.  Now let's hope I like my new iPhone....

I like the Cheesecake factory.  It is always good for a substantial, good meal.  Is it phenomenal, no?  Is it bad, no. It's good and for the most part, consistent.  We came in around 8 pm on a Tuesday night so needless to say, it was pretty quiet.  There were lots of servers standing around so when it came to get my iced tea refreshed, I was surprised I had to track someone down.  The bartender, who was also our server, was engrossed in a convo with a male customer (perhaps she thought he'd be a better tipper? ;) ) so we were invisible to her.  Too bad too, as she seemed promising.  One of my staple dishes I get at the Cheesecake Factory is the Tomato Basil pasta.  It is always an ample serving that I can usually get 2 meals out of.  I also love a good old slice of Original Cheesecake.  Keep it simple and you won't be disappointed.

I really can't find any reason to not give Fleming's 5 stars.  Is it absolutely the best meal I have ever had, no, but pretty darn good.  We have been going to Fleming's for years and will continue to do so.  Yes, it is expensive for a typical night out so it's not a go-to that often for us but we still really enjoy the little splurge every now and again.  Fleming's is a great date night or special occasion place with friends.  I typically get the petite filet with the 3oz add-on shelled lobster tail.  The filet is always cooked to perfection and extremely tasty.  The lobster looks small when it is served but is always the right amount for me.  We almost always get a few sides and last night was no different.  We had our standard creamed spinach (my fav), Fleming's potatoes and creamed corn (I wasn't a huge fan of the creamed corn as it was a little spicy and that's not my thing).  The service is always excellent.  Almost forgot to mention that I love the Farmer's Daughter Martini...Delicious!  But beware, they go down quickly!  It's always a nice night out at Fleming's.  Just writing this review is making me hungry!!

Had a really good meal at this Cheesecake Factory last night.  We went with a large group of ten and our server did a FANTASTIC job of being attentive and keeping everything straight; even keeping track of 4 different checks without a hitch.  I had the miso salmon which I tend to enjoy at most Cheesecake Factorys but last nights was especially good.  The salmon was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  Most of our party enjoyed their meals.  There was a small hiccup when one of our meals had what looked like brillo in it but it turned out to be charred corn silk.  The server and manager were very professional and took care of it by quickly expediting a new one as well as taking it off the bill.  Other than that, another good time and meal at the Cheesecake Factory.

This is an extremely caring group of doctors. We have been coming here for 10 years now and they have been caring for my Bichon through all of her illnesses and problems. Whenever she needs to be seen, they make sure they get us in.  They are patient and kind. I have seen every doc in the practice and I really like them all but I am partial to Dr Patterson. She is so completely loving and patient with us and I really feel her empathy for us. I highly recommend this group to anyone who is looking for a great veterinary clinic.

I can't say enough about Dr Lewis. He is extremely kind and knowledgable. Although we are having a really difficult time finding the source of my dogs allergies, Dr Lewis is patient and sympathetic. Highly recommend if you are are looking for a dermatologist for your animal that is very educated and caring.

I can't say enough about E & J Appliance Service.  Ernie has been to my house for two separate issues and was easily able to diagnose the problems as well as tell me what things I might need to avoid further problems.  Not only is Ernie the owner, but I feel that he is 100% honest and reliable.  For one of my repairs, he needed to order a part and it only took a day for them to get it in and do the repair.  No waiting a week like I have with other companies.    I always like to support good, local businesses and this is one I highly recommend you do.  No big chain center, this is an ethical, homegrown company that cares about its customers.  I feel the service is honest and fair and that is all I can ask for.  I will use E & J again for all my future appliance repairs.

My husband and I went to Lupo during our stay at the Mandalay Bay.  We were able to get a reservation the same night and called ahead just 30 minutes prior.  The restaurant is nice enough, nothing too fancy.  We chose to sit on the "Patio" so that we could people watch.  Our server was excellent.  Completely attentive and was able to make suggestions.  He knew the menu well and when I advised him of a potential food allergy, he made sure to talk to the chef with my concerns.  I wish all servers were this attentive.  We ordered the calamari appetizer and it was good.  Not the best I've ever had but good.  We especially loved the bread sticks they provide to all tables.  The olive tapanade dipping sauce was amazing!!  I actually wound up dipping the calamari into it and that was really good!  I chose the chicken picatta for my meal and my husband had the lasagna.  I thought my picatta was very bland and would not choose that again.  My husband loved his lasagna, however.  We enjoyed a couple of glasses of wine and the list was nice.  I would come back to Lupo again.

I really liked the Burger Bar.  This was my first experience and I will definitely love to go back.  I am extremely picky about my burgers.  The worst thing for me is to get a burger with cheap meat or gristle.  I did not have this problem at Burger Bar.    There are many options to choose from on the menu.  There are specialty burgers already designed or you can make your own.  You can choose your bread, kind of burger, toppings and condiments.  I chose an angus burger on ciabatta roll with saut√©ed mushrooms and caramelized onions.  It was delicious!  We also shared the fries and they were good too.  My daughter had a mint chocolate chip shake and that was yummy too.    The only downfall to the Burger Bar is that it is pricey.  I guess that what you can expect in Vegas now so it's no surprise.  The service was good but a little rushed.  All in all, I would definitely come back.  I'd love to try the Kobe burger next time; I just need to wrap my head around a $17 burger!

My first time at U of P stadium was for the One Direction concert (ehem, my Daughter is the fan, cough) and man, is it HUGE!  I was worried about how it was going to be for viewing and it was really good.  The acoustics were great and the view ability of the stage was amazing.  It helped that we had fairly good seats in section 132, row 6 but even then, I never felt like we couldn't see.  The seats are comfortable and I never felt cramped.  There seemed to be many food options to choose from.  They really had the parking situation down as well.  For such a large event, traffic out moved really well.  Next time I will remember to park there instead of outside in a lot that took way more time for us to get out of.  It was a very nice experience at this stadium and I will not be hesitant to see another concert here.

Our go to BBQ place. Cafeteria style and when busy, it's hard to find tables. Other than that, great food, great prices, great people. An AZ tradition.  Some of my favorites include the ham and turkey combo plate, beans (not just beans but also meat), the buttery corn, the mac and cheese (such a guilty pleasure) and the homemade apple sauce.  Really, you can't go too wrong with anything from Joe's.  It's good stuff!

I am normally a real fan of VinciTorio's.  I don't get over there much as it is a bit of a hike for us.  We decided it had been too long since we had been there so we gave it a go on Saturday night.    The food is very good here.   I will say that the sauce was a bit tasteless on this night and I was surprised.  It is normally nice and tangy but it was a bit bland which is not the norm here.  We started with the bruschetta which is always very tasty.  My husband had the veal tortellini which was delicious and I opted for the chicken parm.  In the past, they have always been able to accommodate me with doing veal parm instead of chicken but I was a bit disappointed to find out they can't do that anymore.  I understand why but I wish they would put it on the menu because it is so good.  The chicken farm was tasty but the penne was a bit watery so there was a lot of water on my plate.  The wine list is nice and there are some nice options to choose from.  Service is pretty good but the nicest thing is to see the owner is always there.  This is a nice restaurant for a date night or a meal with friends.

This buffet is completely disappointing on so many levels.  There are WAY better buffets in Vegas so avoid this one.  I am going to list the reasons why:  1. The food was terrible.  The peel and eat shrimp was mushy and slimy.  Even the fried shrimp was mushy.    2. They did not restock the food often enough.  The entire time I was there, there were things that were not restocked.  Essentially, it felt like many items were sitting too long.  3. The service was just ok.  The cashiers were not friendly and the server we had disappeared a lot.  4. Silverware was dirty.  5. Relatively small amount of menu items.  Most buffets I have been to in Vegas offer much more, especially for the price.  6.  Now this part is the worst....I GOT FOOD POISONING.  I believe it was probably from the buffet but I can't say that with 100% certainty (that is why I am putting it at the bottom of my list when it really should be at the top).  I do know that I did get the food poisoning from somewhere in the Mandalay Bay as that is the only place I ate all weekend.  I am pretty sure it was the buffet.  Overall, hated it and I will never go back!

Chandler Fashion Center is my go to mall when needing to do some serious shopping.  The mall has a nice assortment of stores at varying levels and tastes.  Lately, there has been some revitalization being done to the mall and there have been a lot of stores closing, moving and opening.  There is a nice assortment of restaurants and the food court has pretty much everything anyone would want.  Typical anchor stores are present and in many ways, I prefer the Chandler Macy's to the Scottsdale Macy's so that's a plus.  This mall draws in the teen population but I always feel safe there.

Let me start of by saying that I normally LOVE Firebirds. This visit,however, was just "off". I am still giving it 4 stars because I believe that mistakes happen and sometimes restaurants have an off night.   We went to Firebirds to celebrate Mother's Day. It wasn't an incredibly busy night which surprised me. There were 6 people in our party. We were seated a little ahead of our reservation time which was nice. When we got to our table, I noticed all kinds of food and dirty linens underneath the table. They did bus the table but never bothered to look down. We ordered drinks and had to ask for straws...all of us. I asked and she gave me one but didn't bother to give any to the rest of my party. Then my mom asked and she still only gave one...I thought that was weird. Is this a new rule to only give straws to the people who ask?  We ordered our meals after some time and salads were brought promptly. We were advised that bread was in the oven but shortly thereafter, I noticed others getting bread so we needed to ask again. After receiving our salads, all of us needed more salad dressing. That has never happened before. I normally love the mixed green salads but they just weren't great this time. I'd think it is pretty hard to not get that right...  Our main courses arrived in a good amount of time and right away I had to send mine back. I ordered the special filet medallions with lobster meat with hollandaise on the side. Of course, it came slathered in hollandaise. The server knew it too and realized it the minute I looked at it. Everyone else's food came and all else was as it should be. I received my food about 5 minutes after everyone else which was ok. Manager came over and apologized but that was it.   I am not sure what was going on last night and I am hoping it was just a fluke. The regular manager that we normally see there wasn't there and I am wondering if that's why things were off. Either way, we will be back...as I said, I normally love Firebirds so I am willing to give it another go.

I am very happy to revise my previous review.  I am also very happy to say that the Firebird's that I normally love is back!  I knew my last less than stellar visit was a fluke and I was right.  This time, Firebird's lived up to my expectations and exceeded them.  We took my grandmother for her 86th birthday as she is also a fan.  We had a table for 8 people.  I am mad at myself for not remembering our servers name as I would love to give her kudos.  She got all 8 orders right and they were to perfection.  She had a great attitude and was super friendly.  Our food was  really good and the restaurant was clean.  All the things that were not right last time, we right on this time.  I am so happy that things are the way they should be!

Dr Oswald has been my dentist for many years. I have complete trust and faith in Dr Oswald. He is thorough, patient and explains everything. He is very calm and mild mannered which is something I appreciate in a dentist. He puts you at ease from the moment you get in the chair. The office staff is super friendly. One thing that Dr Oswald does that is rare these days is calls you the night of any procedure. I find this very comforting. I completely recommend Dr Oswald and Red Canyon Dentistry!

Nick's is always a stopping point for us when we are in Scottsdale.  We have been going to Nick's for years.  Great Italian food at very affordable prices.  Nick is almost always there when we go so it is always nice to say hello.  Staff is great but we do miss our favorite server, Terry, as she has retired.  Weekends can be pretty busy, especially in season so go early to avoid a wait.  They will take reservations for parties of 6 or more only.  Looking forward to many more years to come at Nick's!

I absolutely love Sprinkles.  I can't get enough.  It is like crack for me.    I just don't get the negative reviews.  The cupcakes are extremely tasty, moist and rich and the toppings are absolutely some of the best I have ever had.  And I try a lot of cupcakes.  The prices are perhaps just a smudge over some other retailers but not too bad and in my opinion, are worth it.  The red velvet is my favorite but I also love the chocolate banana (when they have it) and the carrot cake.  Wait, I actually really love them all.  I have never had a bad Sprinkles cupcake.  Oh how I wish there would be a Sprinkles closer to me...oh wait, maybe they are doing me a favor....

I haven't been to a BJ's in a while so much has changed...for the better.  The menu is very large now and offers some really nice lunch options.  The lunch portions are very large and well priced.  I was pleasantly surprised as I have never been a real BJ's fan in the past but I would definitely come back.  The restaurant was cuter than I remember.  I had the the shrimp scampi and tomato and mozzarella salad lunch combo.  Both were very good.  The tropical ice tea is delicious as well.  Our server could have been friendlier and more attentive but it wasn't a problem.  Can't wait to come back and give it another try.

I am seriously disappointed in this Margaritaville.  We stopped in for dinner before a concert and it was fairly busy but nothing they couldn't handle based on the size of the place.  There were 4 adults and 4 kids in our party.  We all ordered fairly quickly and food arrived in an appropriate amount of time.  1 of the meals came out completely wrong, like not even the right dish.  Our server took it away and then brought the right dish out.  Then, 2 of our meals tasted so bad, we couldn't eat them.  They just tasted like they were off, almost spoiled.  They did offer to make new items and we had them make one other dish for my friend and I decided to pass and just get dessert so I ordered a piece of cheesecake.  It then took another 20 minutes to get my cheesecake.  I do want to give props to the manager who handled it correctly but overall, I am giving 1 star purely on the fact that the food was completely generic and not good.   The food tasted and looked like mass, cafeteria food.  There are better restaurants at Westgate so next time I will go elsewhere.

As an RCI exchange member, I had points that were unused and needed to use them or lose them so we decided to take a trip to Vegas.  By the time we decided, most places near the strip were sold out so we decided to give Grandview a try as the photos looked nice.  We were driving in so while it wasn't close to the strip, we had transportation so it wasn't a problem.    We rented a 2 bedroom unit.  We asked for a newer building and were placed in the Rosemary building.  The unit was very nice and clean as well.  The decor was very pleasing, the bathrooms were large and the beds were comfortable.  The kitchens were nicely appointed although we didn't really use them.  I did feel as though there could have been a few more amenities such as a makeup mirror, more toiletries, etc.  Also, parking is very annoying at this property.  There were never any spaces near our building so we were always forced to park in the garage near another building.  We did have a little bit of a snafu during our stay.  We returned back to our unit after a day of sightseeing and couldn't get into our room.  We had checked in earlier and spent a few hours there before leaving.  We thought maybe the keys were demagnified and called the front desk.  They told us we were at the wrong room.  What? They told us we were supposed to be on the 6th floor, not the 8th floor.  We thought for a second that maybe we just got it wrong and didn't remember the floor right so we went down to the room they said was ours.  We couldn't get in there either.  Called again and they sent security and he opened the door and none of our stuff was there.  I told the guard that this wasn't our room and we are supposed to be on the 8th floor and the front desk has it wrong.  I asked him to take us up to the 8th floor again and that I would show him that all our stuff was in there and that they wrote the 8th floor room on our paperwork.  He wouldn't do that with out talking to the front desk so we had to call them again from this vacant 6th floor room at which point they told us we needed to move all our stuff down from he 8th floor to the 6th floor.  WHAT?!!! WHY????!!!  We were given that room first and this was not our problem.  They finally, after being placed on hold for a long time, agreed to rekey our original room and let us in.  GEEZ!!!  I'm sorry, but its not rocket science.  Stop looking the computer and think like a human!  Finally we got in our room again and went to bed.  The next day, I called to speak to the main manager of the hotel to make sure we wouldn't go through this again and he said that he got an email and that all was fixed.  Thats it.  He barely managed an "I'm sorry".  It's sad because the room was actually really nice but the customer service is very lacking.  I won't be back.

Brio is a good chain italian food restaurant. Food is consistent, service is good and has nice environment. It is not the same as going to your neighborhood italian spot but does a nice job.  Brio is always willing to make modifications to dishes as long as they are able.  I usually order the Penne Mediterranean and change out the sauce and cheese they are always willing and able.  The dish the way I choose to do it is so good and I have even had servers tell me that it should be on the menu that way.  Brio can get pretty busy, especially on weekends so get there early or wait.  The dining room is very large and there is a pretty large patio as well.  There is also dinner service in the bar area.  Brio offers a solid menu and service therefore making it one our favorites.

I love La Calabria.  It is a locally owned restaurant and right away that is a nice change from the chain food haven we live in here in AZ.  La Calabria's head chef is actually the owner who was born and raised in Italy so you can't get more authentic than that.  The owners are very friendly and they will remember you if you take the time to talk to them.   The ambiance is simple and reminds me of a lot of restaurants I was raised on on the East Coast.  The sauce is just the way I like and that is not an easy task as I somewhat consider myself an Italian food snob.  I love the Veal Parmigiana as it, again, is just what I am used to.    In this day of chain restaurants, it is nice to see a mom and pop establishment make it through.  I hope they will be around for a long time to come.

I just love Mandarin Chef. One thing that puts it above the rest is the fact that they will deliver to my house.  The food is good and the prices are definitely right.  They even have a nice website portal so that you can order directly from their website.  It is user friendly and the delivery is very prompt.  We usually order quite a few dishes and they are always very good.  I am a really picky Fried Rice eater and like mine a certain way;  lots of veggies, egg and cooked darker brown.  So many places don't do it the way I like it and the way that I grew up used to it.  Mandarin chef is one of the closest I have found.  Today, I ordered a lunch special of Honey Chicken (usually an entree we order for dinner) and it came with fried rice (not the usual with stuff in it), a crab puff, a vegetable egg roll, and soup.  The price is right for $5.99.  You just can't get all that somewhere else.  The food is always tasty and I will always go back to Mandarin Chef.

We are fans of the Keg and last night we went with some friends.  It was a party of six and it was a very busy night between homecoming and it just being a Saturday night.  We were initially told it would be about an hour wait so we headed straight for the bar.  We ordered drinks and within 20-30 minutes our buzzer rand to tell us our table was ready.  We were surprised.  We sat in the dining room and had a really nice server.  I can't remember her name but she was good and friendly.  We ordered our food and then had salads shortly there after.  A while later, our food came.  All was as it was supposed to be and very good.  We were then informed by the manager who came by to talk to us, that the food took way longer than it should have and that she'd like to give us all dessert.  Here is the thing, we barely noticed, nor did we complain.  We were having great conversation and didn't even notice that it took a while.  I thought that was excellent customer service.  To offer us free desserts without us even making a peep was very nice.  We got our desserts which were all very good as well.  The food has always been good any time we have been to this Keg.  The steaks are tender and flavorful.  The service has always been good and despite the fact that it took a little longer than usual last night, the service was excellent.  I am a fan of The Keg.

Love, Love , LOVE Grimaldi's.  Now being that I am a native NY'er, this is not the pizza I grew up eating.  That's ok though...Grimaldi's is different but great.  This San Tan location is the only one I will go to as well.  They do the pizza just the way I like it; the perfect amount of sauce (other locations have lacked in this area), the cheese is ample and bubbly and the whole pizza is always cooked to perfection.   Salads are always good and plentiful and the calzones are enormous!!  This location can be VERY busy so go early, but not too early as they stoke the ovens late afternoon.  There is a nice patio that I love to sit at during lunch hours.  The only downside to Grimaldi's is that they are very limited in the reservations that they will take; only 1 per hour.  Yes, you read that right.  Not sure what the logic is there but it has caused some problems for my parties in the past.  Ultimately though, Grimaldi's is worth the wait!

This place is just ok. I really, really wanted to like Jimmy's but I just couldn't.  Perhaps it's due to the Chicago vs New York food war that has been waged for decades and me being a native NY'er made me dislike it.  But IMO, there are definitely better italian restaurants. It is edible but that's about it. Service was spotty, food was mediocre.  It's even funny when you read previous reviews from native Chicago-ans who didn't like it....that should tell you something.

I am very pleased with The Men's Wearhouse and how they treated my son. My 17 year old went, on his on, to pick out his tux for his prom. They were very helpful to him making recommendations to ensure a close match for his date's dress.  My son wanted to handle all the details himself and me being the nervous and slightly neurotic mom that I am, I was unsure how successful he would be.  The salesperson selected a nice dark gray Vera Wang tux instead of the typical black one. He matched a nice salmon color vest and tie to match his girlfriends dress. While it wasn't a perfect match, it was as close as they could come. When he picked up the tux, it was a perfect fit and all pieces were clean and perfectly pressed. While I thought the rental might have been a a little pricey, it was really nice and they looked like a beautiful couple at the prom.

Decided to give Epic a try after driving by it so many times.  I had been going somewhere else that was really close to my house but I just wasn't receiving the results I was looking for with my previous stylist.  It is really important for me to have a  salon close to home and not have to travel too far.  Just making the time to get there is hard enough so it needs to be close and Epic is close enough for me.  I wasn't at all familiar with any of the stylists so I read many reviews.  Breanne's name kept popping up so I thought I'd give her a try.  She is a level 3 stylist which gave me confidence.  Upon meeting Breanne, I showed her what I didn't like in my hair and also showed her a couple pics of some color and style that I like.  I will say, I was kind of nervous not knowing what to expect but she really did achieve the look I was going for.  While the color is much lighter than I have ever gone before, I really like it.  The cut is absolutely fabulous.  I can tell she really knows her stuff.  She is quick too.  Sometimes I am stuck in the salon for hours and she was definitely on the quicker side but I never felt like she skimped on me.  Breanne is somewhat reserved at first but once we got to talking, I felt like we connected.  I also found out she is my neighbor and we have another friend in common.  I will definitely be going back to Breanne and Epic.  I will also be bringing my daughter there next time as well.  I think I found a keeper!

This is always our go-to place for a fun night out.  The staff is always friendly and fun, the atmosphere is upbeat yet not too overpowering.  The food is limited but really good, too.  Try the cheese fondue and the sliders.  Yummy!  Also, a nice casual lunch spot as well.

I have bought 3 BMW's from Chapman BMW and have been very pleased each time.  I have never had a problem with anyone there, in fact, everyone is very friendly and treat me well as they know I am a loyal customer.  Sales, service and finance are all very professional and friendly.  I have referred a lot of people to Chapman and they have all been happy as well.  Of course cars can have problems but Chapman has always treated me well.  I think I am a lifer at Chapman BMW; I just don't think it gets much better.

I come to this Walgreens quite a bit and just recently, transferred my scripts here as well. The service is good and friendly. The store is well stocked with lots of variety. The pharmacy seems to open a few minutes later than posted hours but maybe it was a rare circumstance. Overall, a good, clean Walgreens.

I really like this Sams Club. It is clean, the staff is friendly and willing to help and there is a decent selection. I will say that while I prefer Costco, I really do like Sams. They also have some things at Sams that Costco doesn't offer so that makes it a nice alternative. The food selection here is really nice as well. There are often deals to join that give you some free items so look for those. A good shopping experience.

When it came time for my daughter to get braces, we were given many referrals from friends. I checked out a few but at the end of the day, I knew Aspen was the place for us.  The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming.  Dr. Hunsaker made us feel right at home.  We really liked his personality and he didn't give us the hard sell like some others did.  My daughter feels very at home with him, as well as his assistants.  The office is very pleasant and clean.  They do offer tokens for children to collect as a reward system for many things from wearing the practice t-shirt, to good maintenance of the braces, etc.  That makes it fun for the kids.  They also have the colored bands that kids get to choose each time they are switched out.  That adds even more fun and makes my daughter happy.  The prices are the best part.  Not only did they give us a great price (braces are not cheap! lol) but they will work with you on interest free payments.  I do believe they will also work with you if you find a better price elsewhere but we didn't have to worry about that as Dr Hunsaker was the most affordable from what we found.  I am very happy the we chose Apsen Orthodontics and have full faith that anyone who goes there will  be happy!

I love Aspen so much that I, too, decided to come here for braces for myself!  I am three months in and I am very happy.

During a stay at Mandalay Bay, we got yogurt and a crepe here.  I ordered the caramel apple crepe and it WAS NOT what I expected.  I thought I was going to get real apples with caramel and instead, it was APPLESAUCE inside a crepe with caramel drizzled on top.  Not at all what I would have ordered if I would have known.  A very expensive applesauce might I add.  I would not eat here again.  Ever.

Smaller than most Harkins and maybe that is why it tends to be cleaner.  It feels like there are more smaller theaters at this one but I like it for its cleanliness and proximity to home.  It also is a lot less crowded which is a huge plus!

We have been coming here since my son was two and he is now 17. This office feels like family after such a long time with them. They are so warm and great with kids of all ages. I can't bear to leave as my kids are almost too old to come here! I really trust the docs here and they have always been great with my kids.

This particular Fry's is my grocery of choice.  It is still fairly new and has a large offering of all kinds of food, housewares, pharmacy, etc.  The staff at this location is helpful and friendly.  As of late, the produce has been less than good and that is why I am deducting a star.  Other than that, the store is very clean and bright.  Fry's Marketplace is definitely my favorite of the chains and I will continue to shop there often.  Tip: Avoid this store like the plague on the first Wednesday of every month.  That is senior discount day and it is extremely crowded.

It's so nice to see the Downtown Chandler area revitalized and one restaurant that contributes to this is DC Steakhouse.  I have been to DCS numerous times now and each time has been very enjoyable.  I usually get a filet and lobster tail combo which is always perfectly cooked.  The wait staff is always professional and knowledgable.  The ambiance is very nice; a little urban chic.  DCS has a nice bar area and a nice selection of wines and spirits.  DCS is a great place for a romantic dinner or a night out with friends.  You really can't go wrong.

Love this locally owned boutique!  Clothes are super cute and prices are great.  I love the personal service I get here as well.  Not sure how someone found them rude in a prior review...I have never experienced that there, in fact, they are always very welcoming.  They are always eager to help you find what you may look best in.  I do a large majority of my shopping here for both myself and my daughter.  Katybug Faye is a great place for everyday wardrobe additions or if you need a cute outfit for a night out.  I am glad to see the store doing so well and that they have opened up a second location.  Great clothes, affordable, and close to home.  What else could a girl want?

Eh.  Just eh.  I have been going to this car wash since it opened and boy, have I seen it decline.  I choose to get my car washed professionally as I don't have time or inclination to do it myself.  Now, I know that it's not the same thing as getting a detail, but I don't think it is too unreasonable to expect that side mirrors be wiped down now, is it?  They miss many major details and I know I could do a better job.  I'm not sure what is going on here; if they've had new management but this isn't the Danny's I used to love. I only hope that they read the reviews are someone in corporate cares enough to try to correct the problems and lack of workmanship that is going on over here.

I agree with the other reviewer.  These people call me, tell me they have worked on my vehicle (even had the make and model which they obviously have gotten off some list as they have NEVER worked on my vehicle before) and then went to tell me that they aren't selling anything and then proceeded to try to sell me something.  Unbelievable.  SCAM!!!!!!!!!

What an adorable place.  I've always knows it's been there for the last few years but had never had an opportunity to go.  Urban chic right in the heart of Downtown Chandler.   The inside is really cute and comfortable.  Exposed brick, comfy chairs and tables all set in intimate conversation spaces.  There was a piece live band singing contemporary ballads adding to the ambiance.  We chose to sit outside on the back patio (there is a small front patio as well).  The back patio is really nice and comfortable as well.  Big fire pits surrounded by comfortable couches and other seating areas as well.  Twinkle lights adorn the entire outside and again, more exposed brick add to the vintage urban flair.    There is an EXTENSIVE wine list as well as some really interesting cocktails and beers.  We were only in for drinks but asked to see a food menu and that looked interesting as well.  I can't speak to how well we liked the food but we will try some next time.    The only reason I am not going for the full 5 stars here is that the staff seemed a little stiff.  The hostess who greeted us was somewhat curt and our server was good but no-nonsense.  There wasn't anything wrong with them at all, they just weren't as welcoming to us first timers as I would have thought.  As we were leaving, we passed many wait staff and not one of them cracked a smile or said good-bye.  Really, none of this is a very big deal nor will it stop me from coming back, I just wanted to explain why I didn't give the full 5 stars.  I definitely look forward to giving Vintage 95 another try, and another try, and so on and so on....

Apparently I didn't realize what a big deal it is that Chandler has a Rudy's.  I guess it is located in other states and is kind of a big deal.  Who knew?  I am a fan of Joe's in Gilbert so I was skeptical I would like Rudy's as much but I was surprised at how good it was.    The ambiance is really cute.  It is cafeteria style and they will let you sample the meats to help with your decision which is a nice touch.  I got the smoked turkey and it was very tasty.  I would have liked to see some more sides offered.  That was the only thing I thought Joes was better in.  The service was very good, the restaurant is very clean and the food is good.  There are lots of sauce options offered at the table.  I can't wait to try some more meats here!

Finally!  The nail salon of my dreams!  This salon is top notch; gorgeous, clean and comfortable.  I had a gel manicure and pedi and was not disappointed.  Clean is almost an understatement.  I have never been to a cleaner salon, ever!  I love that they use liners on their pedi chairs and I never have to worry that the bowl has been cleaned properly.  In the past, I would try not to touch the bowl with my feet for fear of catching something but I do not have to worry here.  The nail technicians are also top notch.  Very detailed with their work, not a rush job to get you in and out. My daughter even commented on how it smelled so nice in there and she didn't smell any overwhelming chemicals.  I am so happy that this salon has opened and will not go anywhere else. Clean, comfortable, friendly.... I'm a customer for life!

KY-KO not only sealed my home after two massive bee infestations where bees literally got up, inside our walls, but I now also use them for my monthly pest prevention.  While sealing up my home was not an inexpensive venture, it was well worth the money we spent to keep those darned bees (and other pests) out.  Getting bees out of my walls was no small task and to have to do it twice, was really annoying.  Bees leave a pheromone so that they know where to return to and once the pheromone is there, they will come back over and over.  And since about 90% of the bees in AZ are now Africanized, it is not fun to know they are trying to co-habitate with you.  KY-KO sealed my home and they have never returned.  At the time, I was using another exterminating company, had been for years) but always still had many 4 legged friends in my home and outside.  While the sealing did keep the majority out, I still needed to exterminate as there are always doors, windows and ways flying things can get in.  Once I made the switch to KY-KO for my monthly prevention, the bugs virtually stopped.  It is a rare occasion I have a bug in my home other than the occasional Flies.  The nice thing about it too, is they check my seal and make repairs to it as necessary for free and they also remove cobwebs and bug debris around my home.  I am completely happy with KY-KO's service!

I am so impressed with Seville Veterinary.  After a year of mourning the loss of our previous fur baby, we have decided to get a new puppy.  I chose Seville based on some recommendations I received from a group on Facebook.  It is also very close to my home so that was a plus.  From the moment we walked in, we were pleasantly greeted by the from office staff.  The clinic was very clean and I was impressed with that.  We first met with tech Amber who was so incredibly welcoming.  A side note, before we found our current puppy, we were almost going to adopt another puppy that we thought was the breed we wanted.  I was unsure that the foster was correct on the breed he was, however, and called this office to take a look at his picture to verify the breed.  Amber was the one who discussed it with me and was so nice to look at the pic and take it to the vet for a consult on what breed they thought he was.  Turned out, they didn't think he was the breed that the rescuer was telling me it was and saved us from having too much heartbreak.  I really appreciated that.  We then met with Dr Collins.  She was also very loving and knowledgable.  I feel so good knowing that we have such a caring vet who takes time to answer questions and is patient with me.  I am so happy to have found this clinic and we will be going there for many years to come!

Do you need to be from Chicago to understand what makes Portillo's a cult favorite?  Perhaps.  Even so, Portillo's is good.  Portillo's is really big and as crowded as it gets, and it does get crowded, there is always a place to sit.  Lines can be long at times but move swiftly.  The staff is courteous and efficient.  Portillo's is set up with an order counter, a pick up counter and general seating.  The menu is large.  I had the Italian beef sandwich with a generous dunk of gravy.  I was surprised to find the spices I did on the meat; I did get red pepper flakes and wish I would have known as I am allergic.  It was still tasty though.    Do I crave Portillos'?  No.  Would I make the drive just to go get Portillo's?  No.  Would I eat here again.  Sure, when in the area.

Kiwi Loco is currently my favorite yogurt shop.  It is clean, the staff is very friendly and it is close to home for those quick trips.  They have tons of toppings and I am a bit of a sprinkle snob (yes, there are some sprinkles that are just wrong) and they have the kind I like which for me, makes or breaks my yogurt experience.  They always have good and interesting flavors and often offer some sort of special.  Very yummy!

My mom and I bought a groupon for Brazilian Blowout for Fancy That salon. We decided to give it a go after trying numerous other straightening systems and stylists. Kim was extremely knowledgable and very sweet. We felt very at home with her and she thoroughly explained any questions we had. I was unsure how I would like the Brazilian since most of the other straighteners haven't worked great for me but so far, I am thrilled! After my first wash, I already saw an immediate difference imbue long it took me to style my hair and how easy it was to get it straight. Bye bye frizz! I will totally use Kim again!!

Omg, omg, omg. If you are from the east coast like I am, you will understand all the omg's. East coasters are always on the eternal search for food that is "just like home".  I am from NY and so are the owners of Basil and Garlic Bistro. There was an immediate connection. To say the food was "just like home" is an understatement. Fugettabouit.   Now don't go in expecting anything fancy. This is a tiny little joint pizzeria style. Just a few tables with extremely minimal decor. In my opinion, that is part of the charm. No airs about so the food needs to stand on its own. I had the linguine and clams and it is just like I used to get in queens. Just right. My mother had the chicken parm dinner, which is not actually on the menu but they advised me that most heros (sandwiches for people who don't speak NY) can be made into dinners. To say it was excellent is also an understatement. Dad had the meatball hero which was perfection and we took pizzas home which are exactly what we are used and long for. All heros are served on their delicious bread which is also given to the table when you first sit. Amazing.  For dessert we ordered the cannolis as you can't fully judge a place without having their cannolis. Did I say OMG? Oh yeah, I did.   I can't wait to come back to Basil and Garlic Bistro. I will be dreaming about it until then.

While on a trip to Vegas, I decided to stop in to get my nails done as it had been a while since seeing my regular tech at home.  The salon is large and pretty nice.  There was a funky smell in there that smelled like sewage but other than that it was nice.  My daughter and I both asked for gel manicures.  My daughters tech was so fast, I'm not sure how she got a complete manicure.  It literally took less than half an hour which is very unusual.  My tech took longer and was almost an hour.  She did skip a couple of the normal steps that I am used to but every the has their own style.  She did mention that she was new to this salon so maybe she hasn't found her groove yet.  She did do a good job, however and I was pleased with the outcome of how both of our nails looked.  I would go back if I were in the area again.

I like Paradise Bakery. They have a nice breakfast variety as well as lunch/dinner menu of salads, sandwiches and soups. I particularly like the tuna salad and often pair  a half sandwich with a half salad. The nice touch is also the chocolate chop cookie they give you. I know it's always a welcome sweet treat after every meal there.  They have a nice assortment of baked goods as well. One of my favorites is the banana chocolate chip muffin. It is delicious. I feel like Paradise Bakery is well run and almost every one I go to is very similar in taste and quality which makes it nice that you can expect a good, consistent meal every time.

Slate Bistro and Bar is located inside of Trilogy Golf Club at Power Ranch.  It is, despite the guard gate, open to the public.  They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I have eaten all three meals there and they do them all well.  In fact, Slate has been nominated for the Best Breakfast in Gilbert 2014.  The prices are some of the best I have seen for both food and drinks.   There is a full bar as well.  Slate has a very nice ambiance and feels as though you are in a nice restaurant without the stuffy air.  It is a great place to grab a meal after a round, get a few drinks for affordable prices or have a long meal.  The menu has a little bit of everything to hit all tastes and they do offer specials on certain nights.  There is even live music on certain nights, usually Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Make sure to call ahead on weekends as they do sometimes close for weddings.  They also do offer reservations and while in snowbird season helps.   Slate is a really good, consistent non-chain restaurant in an area lacking restaurants.  Definitely a good find.

I was really excited when I heard we were getting a WinCo.  It is a huge store with all kinds of items.  One of the things I especially like about WinCo is the bulk foods area.  Think Sprouts; these are loose, bulk foods that you decide how much you want and put in a bag yourself.  It is a large area offering everything from grains and pastas to candy.    The store is extremely clean and did I mention large??  There is a huge deli department, large produce and everything in between.  The one negative is that they don't carry all the varieties and brands that I normally get at my local supermarket and when you are used to something, you want to get that and not a substitution.  The staff is very helpful and friendly.  The prices are mostly good with some hit or miss.  I have found that while most of the prices are better, there are a few items that are higher and that may just be due to those items being outside of our regional offerings.  You will bag your own groceries so be prepared to do that and cash or debit is king.

I'm not really sure why this place is getting bad reviews. I've had the honey chicken here twice now and both times it was good and tasty. It is quick Chinese food and nicer than a Chinese takeout. I definitely think it blows Panda out of the water as far as taste and quality. The chicken was white meat and not fatty. Overall I like it and would come back.

Do you want to have a great time with friends and have something to show for it? Then this is the place. Gave it a try on a Tuesday night with my friend and our daughters. The picture looked hard but intriguing so we gave it a go. The instructor was friendly and took time to show you step by step. She also offered help when not instructing. I must say, all of our pictures turned out better than I had even hoped. This is a BYOB place so you can bring in your own beverages and food, even alcohol! Tuesday nights are a really good deal too as they are only $20! Definitely check this out if you want to channel your inner artist and even if you think you don't have one, you will be better than you think!!

I've been to Kneaders twice now and both times for breakfast.  It is a cutely decorated store with lots of goodies to look at while in line.  The lines both times were fairly long; there were even lines out the door.  It takes a while to order but once you do, the food comes quickly.  The first time I was there, I had a breakfast sandwich.  It felt and tasted like it was made int he microwave.  It wasn't great.  At that time, I also ordered a mint chocolate brownie and I was thoroughly disappointed as it was very dry.  This is a case where it LOOKED better than it tasted.  The second time in, I ordered the french toast.  It was delicious.  It seems to be a popular item for them and I can see why.  That will definitely be my choice for breakfast there from now on.  I have yet to try Kneaders for lunch and as soon as I do, I may amend my rating.  I will also try a different bakery item so that I can see if it was just a fluke or if their baked goods just aren't any good.

Rita's, where have you been all my life? Oh wait, I know, back east. I am so glad you finally arrived in AZ. Ices and frozen custard. Have one or both, it's up to you. The custard is super rich. Tonight, I chose a gelati which is custard layered with ices. I chose the Swedish fish ices and they were yummy. Just like eating the candy. My husband had a strawberry starburst and that tasted just like the candy as well.  The customer service was excellent. The two gals behind the counter were very helpful when I told them that this was our first time in. They explained the options, gave us a few suggestions and let is try a couple samples. I am excited to come back after June 21 when a new flavor is coming; watermelon with chocolate "pits". Sounds like it's going to be great!!!

I couldn't wait to try High Tide after reading lots of reviews here and hearing a general buzz in the community.  Upon arrival, when getting out of our cars in the parking lot, we immediately smelled the seafood smell.  Now, I am not bothered by that.  I grew up in a fishing village on the east coast and am used to the smell but I can understand how someone not used to it might be a little nervous.    Upon entering, we immediately noticed how nice the restaurant was.  Very nicely done; color scheme was pretty and felt nautical, finishings were high end and tasteful.  We found it very comfortable.  We asked to sit closer to the bar at a table on that side as that is where is seems like more of the action is happening.  The bar is very large and the boil pots are there manned with a chef for some of the dishes.  We decided to try a few different appetizers instead of entrees.  An added bonus was that we found out they had just started a happy hour deal that included most (excluding a few exceptions) of the appetizers at the rate of half off.  What a deal!!  I had a cup of lobster bisque which was some of the best I have ever had.  There were bits of lobster in almost every bite.   It wasn't too heavy like a lot of bisque's tend to be.  It was pretty much perfection.  We also tried to cajun shrimp boil, crab cake and lobster mac and cheese.  All dishes were quite large and very ample.  The shrimp boil was chock full of shrimp.  There was no skimping here.  All the food was very good, although I thought that the lobster mac and cheese was a tad bit bland and could have used a little more flavor.  It would definitely not stop me from trying it again, however.    Service was ok; our food, which was just appetizers, took about 40 minutes which I thought was long.  Yes, it was our meal but what if it wasn't?  40 minutes for appetizers would mean a 2 hour dinner if we had entrees. I'm not sure if this is standard timing and I would tend to think not.  It will not stop me from coming back, that is for sure.  We really enjoyed ourselves at High Tide and can't wait to come back with friends and family.

SO excited about the new Ice Den Chandler.  This is now our home rink and it is beautiful!!  The renovations are going great and it will be so nice when it is done.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars yet is that it is not fully completed.  I will amend my review when it is done.  There are quite a few things I am looking forward to: a nice cafe, a great restaurant to be able to sit and eat and watch my daughter, awesome classes, organized scheduling and ice monitoring, a well stocked pro shop, a workout facility and more!  This is going to be a premier facility when it is done with top notch coaches, classes and training offerings.  I am so excited for the future!

You've never eaten at anything like Fractured Prune unless you've eaten at a Fractured Prune.  The concept is new and fresh. Warm plain cake donuts done many ways. There are many glazes and toppings to choose from.    We tried three different kinds; the blueberry, OC sand, and the peppermint patty. All were  good and warm. I have a feeling these May be better when warm. I'd like to go back and try a bunch of the others.  There are recommended combinations so if you are unsure what to make, try one of those. I did like the OC Sand best out of the ones we tried. It is also the most popular selection. The staff was helpful and courteous.

A friend suggest Original Chop Shop for lunch and I had never heard of it before so I agreed as I am always up to try something new.  The Original Chop Shop is located in Downtown Chandler in what was the old Kokopelli Winery.  While it is sad to see one business go, it is so nice to see a new, trendy place open up as a continuing part of the Downtown Chandler revitalization.  Original Chop Shop is really cute.  I would call it a shabby chic design with historical details.  It is light and bright and really comfortable as a lunch or breakfast place.  This is their third and l have heard, largest location.  There is a walk up counter to order and then they bring you your food.  There is also a small grocery area in which to get some healthy snacks, mostly assorted chips and popcorns.  Now this isn't your typical menu; the Original Chop Chop has a menu designed with freshness and healthy foods in mind.  I decided, after some deliberation, to go for the Tuna salad sandwich on low carb wheat bread.  The tuna was really good and the vegetables were really fresh.  The added little bonus was that they put an olive tapanade spread o the sandwich which gives it a little tang and that was really good.  The sandwich also comes with a little side of field greens with a good vinaigrette.  I also decided to order a side of the sweet potato hash with kale and onion.  I have never had anything quite like that before but I really liked it.  It had a little sweetness to it and It was way more healthy than fries!!  I also had the blackberry black iced tea and that was delicious.  I wanted to try a protein bowl and I will try that the next time as I will definitely be back!  I am a fan of the Original Chop Shop!!!

AZ ICE Gilbert is the new name of what once was Polar Ice Gilbert.  It is under new ownership.  AZ ICE is our home rink and we have been skating there for many years with our kids either figure skating and playing hockey.  I am very excited about the changes we have seen so far for the betterment of the rink and the community.  I know that they are continuing to make changes and I am very hopeful about all the good things that we are seeing.  The ice conditions have already improved, the cleanliness of the facility is noticeably improved and the cafe seems to be headed in the right direction.    The grand opening was a nice event.  There was free food, games, music and face painting.  The mayor of Gilbert was in attendance as well as, the new owner and many from the Gilbert Parks and Rec department.  It was nice to see everyone all there together, unified, as this was a long process to get to this point.    Business transitions are hard and take time and I am willing to take time and evaluate those changes as they happen.  I hope to be able to come back after some time and amend my review and make it 5 stars!

Really cute place for a kids birthday party or just to go play.  I had a birthday party here for my daughter many years ago and just attended my nephews party as well.  The place seems to be well kept and the staff is attentive.  It seems pretty clean but it is also very dark in there so who knows what lurks when the lights are on.  Overall, a good place to take the little ones for playtime or birthday.  They will enjoy it.

I am impressed with MOD pizza.  I want to say that the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is for the seating and comfort of the restaurant, but more about that later.  MOD is a design your own pizza restaurant with just a few other offerings such as salads and milk shakes.  Think of it as a subway or Chipotle of pizza.  The menu is limited so if you don't want pizza, go elsewhere.  When we were there, the line was long and out the door so come at off times if you don't want to wait.  There is pretty much every type of topping you can think of.  The only topping they didn't have was green olives, which I would love if they added.  There are suggested pizzas but you are free to pick your own as well; just pick a sauce, a cheese, veggies, meats and finishes.  You are free to pick as much or little as you want and you pay the same price depending on what size you choose.  The prices are very affordable.  The pizza moves downy he line with you and then gets fired in a (coal, I believe) oven.  It takes about 5-7 minutes to complete and then voila, your pizza is ready.  The crust is a little bit like a lavosh crust, not a typical pizza crust, but still tasty.  I really enjoyed the pizza I made; red sauce with mozzarella, artichokes, mushrooms, black olives, basil and spinach with a pesto drizzle.  It was delicious.  We also shared a caesar salad which was good too.  As far as seating, this is where I would love an improvement.  The seating areas are small with some high top tables and a few booths.  The problem is the boots are smack where the line is so you have people on either side of you watching you eat while they are standing on line.  It is pretty uncomfortable.  There is a patio outside with misters and wire patio furniture as well.  Not exactly comfortable, especially in the summer.  I just wish this restaurant was bigger with better seating.  This is not the kind of place I will bring my parents or grandmother for that matter as they won't find it comfortable.  I can't wait to come back and try all the different combinations of pizza I can think of.

Was super excited to see a wokbox opened up at this location.  I decided to do a quick take out order of honey chicken for lunch. The staff was friendly but it was completely empty when I went in. The decor seems exactly the same as the Gilbert location and was clean. I got my meal home and it was nothing like the way I get it at the Gilbert location. There was practically no sauce at all on the chicken and the white rice was old and dried out tasting. It also had lots of black flakes all over that indicated that it was cooked a burnt, not well cleaned wok. Overall, I am very disappointed with this location and either I will only go to the Gilbert San tan location or will wait for this location to improve. Sad day.

There are so many new and exciting restaurants coming to Gilbert and Zinburger is just one of them.  For so long, there was a limited amount of restaurants in this downtown area and now, there are a bunch to choose from.    Zinburger is a lovely decorated restaurant with a shabby chic feel.  It is an open air concept with a nice outdoor patio and a large dining room that has windows that can completely open to the outside for that open air feel so even if you aren't outside, you feel as though you are.  The bar is nice and large and I can see coming here to spend time at the bar as well.    The burgers here are what I would call a gourmet burger without being stuffy.  I am really picky about my burgers but these are really good.  The taste is just right and there isn't any gristle.  The fries are hand cut and tasty as well and can be shared.  The only thing I thought it lacked was a little presentation.  The burger was literally on the plate with nothing else.  It looked lonely.  Service was very good and we were able to spend some time without feeling like we were being rushed.  I will definitely be back to Zinburger.  It is a nice place to meet up with friends!

I absolutely love this place.  Such a great place for meeting with friends, having drinks and their food is really tasty and well priced too!  The building is beautiful.  They really did a nice job with it.  The service was very good both in the restaurant and on the golf side.  I will say it gets VERY crowded so come early as you could wait a while for a bay.  The price for golf is a tad bit spendy...but they also offer memberships that could be an option.  It is a great place for families, couples or just about anyone.  I really enjoyed my first visit and can't wait to go back!

Gave Local Eats a try on their opening day; well almost opening day...they have been open for about a week for dinner with the same menu but this was the first day they were open for lunch as well.  Located in the same strip mall as their sister restaurant Blue 32, this is a much smaller and cuter spot that seems to be more aimed at a lunch crowd.  The decor is pleasing with a bit if a shabby chic theme and the restaurant is set up with an order counter at the front and food will be delivered to you when it is ready.  I was surprised that it wasn't crowded but I am not sure how much advertising they have done to announce that they are now open.  Staff is friendly although I can tell that they are still learning.  The menu is a really great one for lunch or a light dinner.  From pizzas made to order, fresh sandwiches and salads, this menu is sure to please all tastes.  From what I understand, they are willing to even customize most things as well for the pickier eater. I chose the Mozzarella caprese sandwich.  It was served on a ciabatta roll and had lots of flavor including pesto and balsamic.  The only complaint I had was that the ciabatta was very soft, almost soggy.  I would have liked a little more crispness of the roll.  my friends ordered salads and they were very hearty and fresh and they enjoyed them.  I am really excited that this place has opened so close to home. It is also good for take out so I will definitely give that a try as well.

Went to promo on a Saturday night with another couple for dinner. We had a little bit of a wait so we decided to get some drinks and an appetizer at the bar. The bar is very large and very comfortable.  The restaurant itself is fairly small and there is a decent size patio as well. The bartender on duty was very knowledgeable as well as friendly. We got four glasses of wine and a bruschetta plate and it was very good.  Shortly thereafter, we were called to our table.   Once seated, we were promptly greeted by a very friendly and upbeat server. She was also very knowledgeable about the menu and made some good suggestions. We decided to get two pasta dishes and two pizzas for the four of us to share. My husband and I decided on the tagliatelle with meat and peas and a margarita pizza. Both were absolutely delicious. Our friends enjoyed their selections as well. After our main entrees, we did opt for dessert although I probably shouldn't have because my hips felt it the next day. We had the creme br√ªl√©e and our friends had the cannolis and both were very good. A few more glasses of wine were also had as well. When we were finished, we walked away saying what a great night it was. Food, atmosphere and friends.

You want a tattoo? You should come here. I found this shop because my favorite artist, Bryan O'Keefe, moved here. The shop is new and clean. The nicest thing about this shop is that everyone who works here is really nice and welcoming.  For this latest tattoo, I brought my son in for his first. Bryan spent time explaining to him the procedure and really worked with him on his design. I knew going in that he would do an amazing job and he just killed it! He is a true artist with an amazing vision. He has tattooed me, my brother, other friends and even my mom. Now I can add my son to that list. Social Ink is a nice shop and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a great tattoo!

So excited to have this new bar so close to my "hood".  There aren't a ton of options in this part of the valley so when The Wild Vine opened, we were super excited to welcome it.  The atmosphere is very comfortable and inviting.  There are comfortable seating areas with leather chairs and sofas.  The customers are mostly people that are from this area and was pleasantly surprised to see some friendly faces I knew.  Think "Cheers" but nicer.  There is often live music which adds a nice touch.  The patio is nice as well.  The menu has some nice offerings but we did not have a chance to sample anything on this night.   I do look forward to going back to try some items.  The beer and wine offerings were nice.  I can't wait to go back and try some more!

I am a huge fan of Blue 32, especially now, as it is so close to home.  The original location was one that I frequented but this new location will be my primary from now on.    Blue 32 has an extensive menu and my go to food choices include the chicken mushroom flatbread and the Blue 32 steak sandwich.  Food is always good, hot and plentiful.  Staff so far has been very good.  Extensive bar and drink options.  Blue 32 is primarily a sports bar and has lots of TVs to choose from.  Blue 32 is great for food and drinks.  This will be our new neighborhood hang out.
