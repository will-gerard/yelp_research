This is a litle long, but worth reading..... After my last experience here I am never shopping at this or any Best Buy store ever again. I came here in September looking for a TV. The associate helping me convinced me to purchase a TV that was an "open box" model and told me that there was nothing wrong with it and they had simply taken this TV out of the box thinking they needed it for display but later realized they didn't. Looking back, that sounds ridiculous but at the time I just wanted to buy a stupid TV so I didn't have to continue shopping for one and I got an extra 10% discount so it seemed like a good deal so I decided to purchase it. I brought the Tv and all the parts that came with it back home. A few weeks later I moved into my new place and when I went to assemble the TV before my cable person was supposed to come over to set up my service I realized that I was missing part of the stand, so basically I had to lean the TV up against the wall. I called best buy and explained what happened. I asked if I could have the part that went with the TV they currently have on display at the store. I was told they throw all those things away, which I knew that was a lie bc that makes no sense whatsoever. I was then told that I could purchase a wall mount or pay for the part myself and they would order it for me. After arguing and being put on hold several times i was told that they would order the part for me and pay for it. Ok great. I was told it might take several weeks to come in. So flash forward 3 weeks and of course I have heard nothing. I call the store and the associate tells me that he will call me back because he didn't want me to wait on hold while he looked up my information. About 3 hours go by and of course I haven't gotten a call back. So I called again and the same associate answers the phone and I told him that I was waiting for him to call me back and he  tells me that there was a problem with the shipment so they will need to reorder it which basically tells me that they never ordered it in the first place. Awesome. So he proceeds to promise to me that he will "reorder" it and it should be there in a week. One week goes by and I have heard nothing. I call the store again. The associate I speak with tells me that he is going to discuss this with the person that helped the last time and find out what's going on as he "doesn't see a record" of my order and that he will call me back. About  7 hours later I of course haven't gotten a call back. So I call the store and am told that that employee had gone home for the day. I asked to speak to the manager which is apparently what I should have done the first time I called but I guess I didn't realize until this point that all of their associates are apparently incapable of doing anything they say they are going to do. I finally get the manager on the phone. I tell him the whole ordeal and he tells me that he will order the part for me. I said "will you really order it because you are the 3rd person who has told me that" and he said "of course. I'm the manager." About 20 minutes later he calls me back and says that he has a better idea and why don't I come in and pick up the part that belongs to the floor model (so yes the first person lied to me when he said they throw them away). I was so happy and he told me that he would leave it at customer services and gave me the name of the supervisor on duty to ask for. The next day I go in there to pick it up. Of course the person I was supposed to ask for didn't know what I was talking about and the part was not waiting at customer service like I was promised BY THE MANAGER. So some other person gets called over and I explain the situation to him and about 10 minutes later he finally appears with the part. I'm happy that I finally have the part and that my TV is no longer leaning against my wall but I'm truly appalled that every single person I encountered there blatantly lied to me. I could see if one or two people did, but even the manager told me he would do something and did not do it. This was beyond poor customer service. If I am ever forced to by another TV or any electronic device in the future it will most certainly not be at Best Buy.

My sister suggested El Charro last night for dinner. I had never been and after looking at some reviews I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, the interior is a little dark and dated, but I found it somewhat charming as I don't like cookie cutter restaurants. Our service was great. Our server was very sweet and attentive. Never had to wait for drink or chip refills. During our meal 2 other employees also came to check on us and see if we needed anything. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food so I ordered a cheese quesadilla which was delicious. The tortilla tasted and appeared to be homemade. My sister had the sour cream enchiladas which she really enjoyed. Prices were very reasonable. For our 2 meals and drinks we paid around $19. I would definitely go back.

Came here yesterday for dinner. We got there around 5:20 and were told it was a 20 minute wait to sit on the patio. There were several empty tables but I assumed they had a wait because there were not enough servers. After 20 minutes we were seated at one of the tables that was empty the entire time we waited. Once we were seated we continued to wait about 5 minutes to be greeted by our server. We almost got up and left but for some reason decided to stick it out. The food was good- we had the table side guacamole, chicken avocado sandwich and enchiladas. The red sangria and margarita were also good but it took 20 minutes to get them. Overall just slow service and I couldn't really figure out why as they weren't that busy. I hadn't been here in several years and do not think I will be back anytime soon.

I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, so I usually order a quesadilla of some sort. I came here for lunch today and ordered a cheese quesadilla. The server asked if I wanted it crispy or soft. I was a little confused and told him I wanted a folded quesadilla, not a cheese crisp. He then told me that unless I order the quesadilla with meat, that all they do is put cheese on the tortilla and put it in the microwave. I was even more confused. Why would I come to a restaurant to order food that has been prepared in the microwave? And why would a restaurant admit to microwaving their food? Anyways, my friend and I decided to split an order of mediocre nachos. Needless to say, I will not be back.

I love this place. Have been several times during the week for lunch and always order the grilled cheese sandwich. It is so yummy!! Service has always been good too.

This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I wish I lived closer to it so I could go more often. And I wish the sangria wasn't so good and so strong so that I could actually come here and be able to drive myself home. All of the food is amazing. I've never had anything that wasn't and I've been here countless times. One of my favorites is the Very Berry Turkey sandwich. It is so good. And the portions are huge so I always have half to eat the next day. The red Sangria is also amazing, and again the serving size is incredibly generous. Prices are reasonable, atmosphere is great, service is always wonderful and the food is awesome! I you haven't tried this place you are missing out and I feel sorry for you.

I came here during the week around 11am so the place wasn't too busy. My friend and I each ordered the 2 egg breakfast and decided to get an order of French toast to split since we were both starving. Our service was pretty good and our server was very friendly. I thought the food was great. My hashbrowns were cooked perfectly. They were crispy and delicious. The French toast was also good- nothing too exciting but it was good. The only things I didn't like was that it seemed a little cramped in there and they use the menus as placemats which I think is kind of gross. Obviously they wipe them off after each guest but it just seemed a little gross to me for some reason. I would definitely return and try something new.

I love this place. They have a great selection of sugar free flavors, prices are reasonable, staff is always super friendly, and I would much rather spend my money supporting a local business than a huge chain. If you haven't tried this place check it out. You won't be disappointed!
