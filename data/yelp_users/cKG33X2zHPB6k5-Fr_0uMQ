Had the Tekka Don and Korean Spicy Beef Noodles. The Tekka don was a bowl of rice, cucumbers, and fresh tuna. Cost 8 bucks, but great contrast to the the noodles. The noodles were stir fried with bell plenty of bell pepper, onions, and sliced ribeye (i believe); for 10 bucks you get just the right amount of heat.

Everything here is on point. Chicken shawarma number one. Ask for extra sauce toooo. Baklava is fresh and addicting! Not dry and generous on the nuts. they also have a trendy market with a traditional flare; food is fast and quality.

specifically ordered salt and pepper squid. we brought it to their attention and they kept forcing we ordered "fish",  instead of salt and pepper squid. um sorry no,  plus it was the fried catfish they serve at cheap buffets. we asked how much for this dish and was met with "around the same price"...... it was. 50 cents more and not even a sorry. my friend is allergic to catfish and he left itching lol.  plus even their tax was .40 cents more and you can't argue with them because the whole tab is written in Chinese. sigh, we're regulars too.

love going here. the $4.95 bulggogi lunch special is the cheapest and most satisfying lunch special I've ever found at a restaurant.

Where do I start? I've been meaning to try this place earlier, but the sketchy (not so appealing) appeal kept stalling my visit. The place is small. When I went, there were no customers. I knew what I wanted from the get-go and I shan't order anything else except for CHEESESTEAK. Upon entering you're greeted with a long buffet bar, which at the time was empty. There was a female host and she was very polite, energetic, and friendly. Good first impression. I ordered a philly cheesteak with provolone, but I had to have cheez whiz on the side. Once the sandwich was delivered-it was gone in probably 3 minutes. Really good- closest thing to a philly here in suburban Avondale. The meat was packed, no frozen taste whatsoever and the onions had a lovely caramelization. Best thing about it was that it wasn't heavy in the tummy. No "ughh why did I just eat that junk" feeling. I've been craving to go back, prices are decent too! Will opt for the hot dog next time. Very casual dining, almost too casual that I'd rather have eaten at home, but maybe it was only because we came at dead time.

came in at 10:30 waited 10 minutes for someone from the talkative crew in the back to take our order.  a pissed off manager by the name of Alicia comes to the front insisting they've stopped cooking and I insisted we came in 10 minutes ago but no one was willing to even acknowledge us.... while profanity is heard from the kitchen regarding their teenage angst.   honey I've ordered from pizza Hut five minutes before they close,  I'm familiar with the drill.  after a brief argument which she lost  she was the utmost reluctant to take my order. bad service and rude faces.

chill hangout spot over a hot bowl of pho. prices are good, boba is good. always satisfies the Pho craving/hangover. #11, #61 is the way to go.

after reading reviews, i was SO excited to be impressed by this restaurant, but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I live nearby and stalled on trying this place but my recent lunch here was bland.   chicken wings were unseasoned and undercooked( frozen then flash fried), their pad thai had the basics but was lacking more tamarind/tart flavor by a longshot- asked for extraextra peanuts as well, their mongolian beef was a clear stir fry with the general cut vegetables(more than the beef) for their other dishes and lacking flavor as well. We both agreed not to come back.

Came at 1 am , STARVING.  They close at 2 am; clearly the signs says it as well.  There must not have been any customers tonight because as we were pulling up and entering, they turned off the open sign and saw their feet shuffling away. I scoffed in dismay, they looked like they were hiding from the cops lol.  The door was open so we peeked our heads in and asked if they were open. They were pissed and the cook forcefully  waved his hand in ANNOYANCE.  The girl asked us "how many" ... If it'll be worth it for them to stay and serve us.  Horrible treatment to their customers. This is not the first time we've received attitude from them for eating late. Will not be back, no grilling anyways.

Came in here and it was pretty busy. Two customers in front of me were upset at the service. I understand why. These ladies were on their phone, making fun of their customer's with complaints in clear sight- i had ordered two spicy chicken and they gave me plain. I came up to tell them and they were on their cellphones. LOL management where art thou? Unprofessionalism to it's finest, talking ish in spanish.

YAS, convenient place for an ice cream stop! They have a lot of other treats as well, very kind lady running the shop. There's so many flavors for shaved ice; this place is neat and well maintained.

My absolute favorite Raspados place. So underrated, they deserve more attention for the quality, taste, and love they put in their raspados :) every flavor is good. Wont disappoint. He carefully layers and packs the ice, syrup, fruit, etc for you. It's not the typical Raspados that taste like snowcones. Each syrup flavor has been cooked perfectly with real bits and chunks of whatever fruit/nut flavor you get. Clean environment, great hosts; will never get tored of this place.

Place is lovely, got a great gel mani from sabrina. The first time. Was ecstatic to find a good place near Central.    Today i returned for the third time, excited once again. They close at 7, but I came in amd there was only one girl who was taking her last client- at 5:30pm, was borderline rude. I think she just wanted to go home early.   This place is not good for walk-ins at all. They'll give you looks if you don't have an appointment- i know because i came back three times and each time there was always a reason why the couldn't take me.

Went with a friend, and got two entrees- Bulgogi and Dduk gook. Rang about 30 bucks, we had a $15 dollar gift certificate.  Served on a sizzling plate and in big*ss bowl, extra rice was $1.50. Ample amount of meat, the rice cakes in the soup were a good consistency of chewy and soft; wish the broth had more flavor. We were the only ones in the restaurant and it was past lunch time, right before dinner. Hard to get the attention of the server, probably better service when there's more people eating.

Came in for some odd piercings...a fellow by the name of Dwayne was kind enough to help me. He was so calming, as i was a nervous wreck. These were not my first piercings but they were more personal ones, so I was literally about to poop my pants.   Halfway through the procedure, I passed out with the needle still in me. Dwayne woke me up, reassured me with water and a jolly rancher, took the time with me. hours of no eating and no sleep + pain = lights out.   I was thankful Dwayne was quick and very professional. I've had my nose and ears pierced here before with no pain at all; plus everyone is truly talented tattoo-wise. Great experience! Thanks Dwayne!
