This place is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. It's a hidden gem that is LOCALLY OWNED and the service and food is absolutely WONDERFUL!!! The prices are really reasonable and the dish I keep coming back for is their garden of eden salad and/or side of hummus. My boyfriend is a big fan of the falafels and malawach cheese crisp. I highly recommend this eatery and think you'll love it as well!

While at the restaurant, I overheard management speaking to one of their employees extremely disrespectful. I was appalled at the disrespect of this establishment at the San tan location. I would never speak to someone in this manner. This should be looked into.

I was very pleased with the teachers and friendly staff at this studio. Times are also good.

Joann Cohen is a dream come true when it comes to matchmaking! She knows the business and is extremely knowledgeable at the dating scene. She has the "gift" and knew from the beginning she had a perfect match for my girlfriend! Boy, was she right...my girlfriend married that mystery man!!! That's what I call success! Thanks to Joann for being the best in the industry.
