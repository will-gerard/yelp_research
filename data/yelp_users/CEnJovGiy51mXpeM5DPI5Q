This is my favorite Thai restaurant! The curries, the noodles, the amazing salad dressing, I just can't rave enough about the food.  My friends will drive 30 minutes from North Phoenix just to eat here.  Definitely a must try.

If you're looking for a good bowl of pho in Central Phoenix, look no further.  We eat here several times a month and the entire family just can't get enough of the pho, even my extremely picky children.  That being said the shaken beef is a lovely sizzling platter of beef and onions with a nice salad and the broken rice is a fun adventure too. The spring rolls leave a bit to be desired but they're not bad.   The only warning I'd give is don't expect amazingly friendly customer service.  The goal here is to get people in and get them food.  Don't drag your feet on placing your order or it might be a while till they come back.  However, once your order has been placed expect your food to be out in short order.    Overall I'd definitely say it's worth the trip for yummy food at a great price!

Tried this place for the first time with some friends in a Friday evening and really enjoyed it.  Friendly staff,  nice feel,  and the chai tea latte was yummy.

Craving Thai food in North Phoenix and tried this place to go. Tried the red and peanut curries.. Extremely dissapointed in both. Very salty and the coconut flavor was sorely lacking. Next time we'll drive the extra few miles south for good Thai at Thai Basil.

Tried the greek salad with gyro. The regular was a very generous portion and came with pita and tatziki. Not fancy but good food.  We will definitely be back!

First time here.  Brought my 14 year old son who hates hair cuts. Chris did a great job.  He knew how to get him to relax and gave him a great cut.  We'll defintely be back.
