They close down their prepared food section way too early, like 6 or 7 PM, which is very annoying.  I've come here a few times with the intention of getting some warm pre-made food and if I get there by 5 I'll be lucky to get something that's been sitting under the heat lamp since noon.  Boo.  They have a completely unnecessary Starbucks counter to complement the Starbucks store across the parking lot, and the other one just down the street.  I once saw a bunch of homeless guys from the park across the street, stand in the driveway and harass someone in a car trying to pull out of the parking lot.  The security guy just stood there and watched for far too long.  I was harassed by some shady looking individual and then followed all the way home.  Super scary.  The cashier's are often super slow and not very friendly.  But it's closer to my place than the 7th Ave and Osborn store which is significantly nicer so I only go here to pick up something quick.  Luckily, the Osborne store is across the street from the Superstar Video so we can kill two birds at one intersection.

The menu has changed substantially in the past year or two.  I was pretty impressed with the new menu when my husband and I moved back downtown after a year in Tempe.  Back downtown, we rekindled our habit of getting tickets at the AMC then sitting around for a couple hours next door at Pizzeria Uno before the movie.  This isn't just pizza anymore.  They have a variety of healthier options, salads, pastas, burgers, and just about anything that you can think of getting at any typical American chain restaurant.  I'm not a big fan of chains, but I'm excited to see the changes made to their menu.  We decided to get an appetizer of wings (because we're from Buffalo, and that is the way of our people) to start off the meal.  When the waiter said they only had one type of sauce, "Buffalo," I had my reservations about how authentic or even decent these wings would be.  So we ordered the smallest size of 8 wings figuring that even if they were not what we expected that we wouldn't feel to hosed with 8 wings.  They were actually good!  The hubby even said if he knew how good they were going to be, he would have just ordered a large order for himself.    Don't get me wrong, these are not the best wings, but they are more than adequate and at the very least good.  The sauce is not Frank's and Butter, but it was a reasonable facsimile: a little hot, a little vinegary.  We asked for them to be cooked crispy and they did, but I can't confirm if that's how they would come if you don't ask.  The rest of our meal was tasty, quick and as ordered as it has been every other time we've eaten here.  The service is consistently friendly and good.

I haven't been to Coach and Willie's in a few years, and I was delightfully surprised at all of the things I forgot about.  The decor is way nice for a sports bar. Dark wood, marble topped bar.  It's just so pretty.  A great selection of draught beer and bottles.  They even have Rogue Hazelnut Brown on Tap!! YAY!  And, the last time I was here I was still a vegetarian and hooked on the garlic and spinach cheese sticks which are actually wrapped and fried like an egg roll.  We had them as an appetizer and they are as good as I remember.  Also served with two dipping sauces - ranch and a heavy marinara.  I wish they had some imagination inspired sauce, but they definitely did the trick.  And then I had the burger.  I ordered the Three Alarm burger with fries.  When the waitress brought it out, I was astounded by the amount of food on the plate.  It was HUMONGOUS.  I barely made a dent in the fresh cut french fries which were yummy, but not crispy enough for my taste.  The burger was so huge I actually had to open it up and eat it with a knife and fork sans bun and accoutrements.  It wasn't even barely spicy, but I didn't mind because it was such a good burger perfectly grilled to order.  I felt horrible for eating so little of what was on my plate.  However, there was no way I was going to put the not-crispy-enough-for-me fries in a styrofoam box to take home.  And I ate what I wanted off the burger, the rest was extraneous.  Next time: I'll ask for a plain burger and 1/4 of the normal amount of fries or some other side.

Wow. I've been reading the other reviews and I'm honestly shocked.  I've been coming here since it first opened and no one knew anything about it.  I liked it better when it was small and unknown, but that's because I could enjoy it at my leisure.  The owner would often come out and chat up the customers and the business in a house was a fairly new phenomenon.  The food has been consistently tasty and fairly priced. The only thing to change over the years is the architecture and decor.  I've taken all sorts of people here to eat and no one has ever disagreed that it was the best Chinese food.  I have always had at least adequate service on First Fridays.  The rest of the time, the service is as wonderful as the food.

I moved away from downtown for a bit and I forgot all about Tom's, but I never forgot the tasty veggie melt I would always get as a vegetarian.  We're back downtown and decided that we would head over there to enjoy some tasty food.  The husband ordered the pulled chicken plate with mustard marinade.  He took one bite and said "I didn't know it until right now, but this is exactly what I needed."  It came with a ton of veggies and he substituted the rice for cottage cheese.    I ordered my veggie melt that wasn't exactly how I remembered it, but still pretty good.  The rye bread was a tad greasy, but perfectly crispy.  The veggies were the same combo and flavor as before, but they used to be chopped up very fine.  Maybe the cook was having an off day.    Davey ordered a Margarita which only comes on the rocks but in a pint glass and the extra in a short glass.  He described the drink itself as "adequate."  There were very few other customers and our server was quick and attentive.  Toms deserves 4 stars based mostly on numerous visits over years.  If today was my only experience though, I might slide down to 3.  And, now that I curbed my veggie melt jones, I'm definitely branching out to the rest of the menu at my next visit.

I went here despite Yelpers telling me not to bother.  What did I get?  An overpriced, bland sandwich, confusion at the menu, and feeling awkward in the location.    It's an uppity cafeteria that makes you want to believe that their food is good for you, but it's not. Don't make the same mistake I did!

About once a week, the husband convinces me that we need pizza.  Ideally, we would get a real one made by people and not a chain.  But, this is often motivated by laziness and downtown Phoenix is the black hole of good pizza.  We would have to drive somewhere to get a good pie, and we're just not having that.  I have a confession to make.  Even though I'm from Buffalo, NY, a city with as many pizza joints as Phoenix has Circle K's, I like Pizza Hut.  It was always the excursion for us growing up.  Sure, we could get a $5 large delivered from the place down the street, but Pizza Hut was an evening out.  A restaurant for pizza, complete with the low-hung light fixtures and the red plastic glasses, it was a special occasion.  And although their pizza was nothing like normal pizza, I developed a special fondness in my tummy for the pan pizza.  And, I'm about to write a review for Domino's as a comparison to this debacle.  We ordered online + 1 star. The website said that it would take 90 minutes - 1 star.  They have blue cheese + 1 star.  The restaurant called to say that they no longer carry blue cheese - 1 star.  We ordered wings that were actually pretty spicy +1 star. They were breaded and had something sweet and sticky on it - 1 star.  The marinara sauce was watered down - 1 star  The delivery guy got lost, forgot the credit card slip and forgot the soda we ordered.  Then he had the nerve to ask me if we still wanted it.  Then he said it would take him an HOUR to return with the pop. -1 stars.  The order was delivered in less than the estimated 90 minutes (minus the pop), he did come back to deliver the 2 liter in less than 30 minutes, and the food was as mediocre as I expected it to be. + 2 stars  I would give a zero if I had to leave the house for this kind of service, but since dinner was delivered they earn 1 star.

This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in all of Phoenix.  I'm never dissappointed with their food regardless of what I order.  It's inexpensive, clean, bright, and delicious.    It's a restaurant, market and bakery all in one building with a large seating area to enjoy the food on location.  You can buy a beer at the market and drink it along with the food you order which is cool.  And the salsa bar has shades of heat to please everyone.    The chile rellenos are awesome and I often ordered them when I was a vegetarian.  But, if you're the type who won't eat beans with lard or rice with chicken stock, then you won't be happy here.  Now that I gave up the vegetarianism, I am thoroughly happy with the variety of flavors in the meat items.  The meat is always moist and flavorful.

I went somewhere tonight that I wish was George & Dragon, which made me realize that I had never written a review for one of my favorite standby restaurants.  So I wanted to give my 100th review to a place so deserving of recognition.  I've been to G&D dozens of times in the past 8 years, and I can honestly say that I've never had a bad meal or bad service.  As a vegetarian, my favorite meal was always the Cornish Pasty. Mmm. Just thinking about it makes my mouth salivate.  A beautifully flaky pastry filled with potatoes and vegetables.  And peas, I love peas.  So yummy, I can't really remember many other meals there, although I do remember having a very good roast beef recently.  The booths are awesome. The owner is incredibly British, and it shows.  There is a ton of authentic paraphernalia decorating these walls.  Plenty of British ales as well.  It's the standard to which I compare all British pubs in the valley.

Not my favorite strip club by a long shot.  It's too crowded; there are too many chairs for this tiny club.  Seriously, the girls can't even do a proper lap dance without kicking some poor schmuck in the head with her big hooker shoes.  And, the few times that I have been here I have been bombarded by dancers.  I know that some might not think this is a bad thing, but before you even get a chance to fight your way to a seat and settle in to your tiny little section, 10 girls have already asked you if you want a dance.

I realized my faux pas with the last review.  Downtown Phoenix is the black hole of convenient delivery pizza.  Yes, there is Pizzeria Bianco but I have yet to find the time, motivation, and dinner companions to accompany me on a 3 hour wait for pizza.  So, we usually order from Domino's.  Partially because their Brooklyn style is pretty good and partially because ordering reminds me of a blog that had me laughing/giggling/snorting for hours: http://www.thesneeze.com/mt-archives/000707.php.  I occasionally find ridiculous stuff way funnier than most people would, and the thought of beef nuggets without footing is making me laugh at this very moment.  *wipes tears from eyes and takes a minute to calm down*  So the ordering is incredibly easy once I stop laughing about whether or not I want the toppings on the right or the left.  And they have the "Pizza Tracker" which tells you what stage your pizza is in and who is completing the task.  I have to say that Wade has done a damn fine job and I'm disappointed if we order on a night that he isn't working.  Not because other Domino's employees mess it up, we have just become fond of seeing his name.  Domino's no longer has the policy of delivering in less than 30 minutes or your pizza is free, but they do come damn close.  Our pizza is almost always here in a half hour (another joy of the pizza tracker).  My only recommendation is to never order the baked dessert thingies; they always taste like garlic because they're made in the same oven.

Reliably good breakfast that is a step up quality-wise from the average greasy spoon, more flavorful than Denny's et al, and has good service.  Yes, it is a diner and a chain, but when I'm looking for a good, uncomplicated, non-fancyschmancy breakfast, this is where I go.  No waiting in lines forever for the newest trendy breakfast spot, we get seated here almost immediately because we sit outside.    I like the skillets, the omelets, and an uncomplicated egg breakfast.  I've also come here later in the day and enjoyed their burgers, while my friends have tried the meatloaf and other entrees without complaint.  This isn't fancy cuisine, it's diner food, and for diner food I have yet to be disappointed.

I finally get back to town after my month-long trip and head out to eat, only to be underwhelmed by a restaurant that everyone on this site loves.  Day two back from vacation: I've gotta make up the debacle from the night before to the hubby.  So, despite an inch of rain falling during the time it took us to drive from Van Buren to Bethany Home, we decided to keep going up to the Phoenix City Grille.  And I'm so glad we did.  I had been here a few times, thanks to the corporate overlords of the funeral home I worked at just up the street.  But, at the time I was a vegetarian and not astounded by the menu (embalming and meat eating just don't mix in my eyes).  Thankfully, I gave up my veggie tendencies, because the food here is incredibly delicious.  The husband loved his burger sans bun and claims that it was the best burger ever.  SCORE!    Oh yeah, and my meal was phenomenal too.  Super juicy pan-fried chicken and horseradish mashed potatoes.  The horseradish had no kick to it, but the flavor was definitely there.  I suppose if I could offer advice to the awesome chefs at PCG, I would suggest adding a splash of horseradish on top.  But I really love that sinus-clearing sensation of good, fresh horseradish.  Regardless, the meal was fantabulous.  The service was wonderful and the atmosphere is calm and cozy.  The menu is a smidge pricey, I won't be making a habit out of PCG, but it will be one of my reward restaurants.

This was the second time I've been to a Village Inn, but the first time I have actually ordered food.  Both trips involved bad service or at least service that was understaffed for the crowd.  My husband had seen a commercial for a breakfast skillet on TV that was apparently very enticing.  So we mapped out our chores for the day and found a Village Inn along our path.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful, but obviously frazzled.  He helped me narrow down our choices by answering our questions about the menu.  I ordered 2 eggs, hash browns, sausage and rye toast.  The husband ordered a sausage skillet.  To our amazement, the plates that were presented to us a short time later, LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE THE PICTURES ON THE MENU.   This is the first time in Arizona that I received hash browns that were actually brown.  What a concept!! And not just brown on the top. Nooo, these babies were browned on both sides. Crispy, yummy and BROWN hash browns.  And I didn't ask for them to be cooked that way.  Every other restaurant in Arizona does such a pisspoor job of browning hash browns, that I've completely given up on asking for my potatoes to be done "dark."  I usually end up with a plate of mushy potato shreds dripping with butter substitute.  Gross. I've come to the point that I ignore that the potatoes are even there.  But before my very eyes is a plate with the potatoes cooked just right, eggs exactly how I asked them to be cooked, tasty sausage links and two thick pieces of marble rye.  That's a lot of food when you plan on actually eating the potatoes.  My husband was equally pleased with his skillet.  We both couldn't believe that there was a chain in Arizona that actually had a decent breakfast, and that we failed to realize it until 5 months before we leave the state.  :(

I've heard a million bad stories about Best Buy since I bought my computer there and added the 3 year warranty about 2 years ago.  Needless to say, the last thing in the world I wanted to do was hand over my baby for who knows how long.  But the connector between the screen and the computer on my lap top had slowly become looser and more broken until no amount of jiggling could make the screen work.  Ugh.  And to top it all off, I only have two weeks until the end of the quarter.  Two Weeks!  But my precious laptop that is always with me at school, clinic and home, wouldn't work any more, so I had no choice.  So I went to the Best Buy that I purchased my computer at because I wanted no problems/excuses, with my closely guarded warranty receipt in hand.  I went to the "Geek Squad" desk and had Keith as my geek (I really hate the name regardless of how apropos).  He was helpful and quick.  It took about 2 minutes for him to take my information, look up my warranty and explain that it would take about 3 weeks to get my baby back.  3 WEEKS!  Does my warranty include a loaner? NO?!? But, Keith quickly calmed my fears of being computerless for the last two weeks of summer quarter.  With a manager's approval, I could "purchase" an open-box computer and return it when I was done and not have to pay a restocking fee.  That's fair.  I am taking a fairly expensive piece of equipment from them.  I head over to the computer department where I explain my situation to Eric.  I need the cheapest open-box computer because I only need it for 2 weeks.  Things weren't looking good, but Eric remembered about a computer that recently came back from service. $450 later and I was walking out the door.    I think it took about 30 minutes from entering the door to leaving on a Saturday afternoon.  Both Eric and Keith were extremely helpful, informative and quick.  I would definitely go back to this Best Buy despite how far it is from where I live now.  I'll update when I get my computer back, which will hopefully be near the estimated time.

Two weeks after I dropped off my computer for service with the Geek Squad I got it back with a new screen and hand rest.  They said 3 weeks and I got it in two!!!  And the open-box computer I purchased to use while mine was in the shop was returned with no problems.   I was so happy we purchased a new Toshiba DVD player for $40. Who knew that DVD players could be so cheap?  I've been using it all day and it works beatifully.

It didn't make me vomit and the waitstaff was okay.    Actually, the wings were adequate tasting but when they came out they were merely warm.  I'm not sure if they were reheated and sauced or if they were left to sit around for far too long after they were cooked.    This place is probably full of mall-bar jagoffs on Friday night thanks to their rather large selection of beers.  But we were there at 11 AM Sunday morning because TC Eggington's was ridiculously busy.  Which means that we got everything that was leftover from Saturday night.  Every bit of my food was dehydrated like it was sitting in a fridge overnight, even the lemon in my iced tea.  Needless to say, I was not impressed.

I went here for the UYE tonight and realized I had been here about 1.5 years ago. I had a great time when I paid for a day spa for my BFF/Bride-to-be and myself.  I thought that the location was well organized, relaxing and complete.  I felt very well taken care of both during the services we received and the down time between services.  Tonight I was priveleged to see the outcome of the renovations they had been doing at the time I was here last.  The area doubled in size and a few new services were added such as a hair salon.  The staff was super friendly, so gracious, and many of them were very curious about Yelp.  Heidi Lamar, the owner, was there to make sure that our every need and question was answered.  Our spa tasting included: hand paraffin dip, eyebrow waxing, chair massage, and makeup application.  Each one of the employees is very skilled in their trade as well as friendly and social.  I will definitely go back for these and other services.  The prices are a little expensive, but well worth it and not outrageous.  For example, a 55-minute massage will run about $100.  I've seen cheaper elsewhere, but you get what you pay for.

I love the food, maybe not a 5-star love, but I do really enjoy the burrito bowl and salads with naturally-raised meat and a big scoop of guacamole (for an extra $1.50).  It's right up my alley.  I particularly love this location because it's the only place I can find to eat in this retardedly far part of suburbia.  I'm working in a clinic one day a week that is 25 miles from my home in downtown Phoenix where real houses and real restaurants exist.  WHY? Why people? Why must you move so far out just to build your houses so close? Why must you live in a neighborhood that is so maddeningly beige and cookie-cutter?  All of this blandness has caused your neighborhood to become as interesting and flavorful as a saltine cracker.  Your starter castle/McMansion/Garage Mahal/Tract Mansion community has sucked all the individuality and creativity out of your life.  Ugh.  Thank god I can at least get a fairly tasty, chain fast food meal, that isn't horribly unhealthy while I watch another square mile of our precious desert get bulldozed.

Oh Xtreme Bean, our time is coming to an end.  We have spent many hours together fretting over exams and the basic science boards.  And, I just want to take this moment to let you know how much I appreciate you.  I love your employees.  Consistently nice, sometimes funny, and always quick to fulfill my order.  Their music selection is pretty awesome too.  Sometimes classic rock, sometimes a blend of old and new indie, but always good enough that I rarely put on headphones unless it's to cover up people talking.  I love your coffee, your ginormous selection of herbal teas, your jalapeno-cheddar cream cheese on a bagel, and so much more that I've tried.  I love the smell of beans roasting in the corner.  I love the comfy desk chair that my heiny is planted in at this very moment.  I love the study cubicles in the vault.  I love the ability to sit here for hours when I have to and not feel as if I'm a hinderance to your business. You are a student's dream.  And your drive-thru window is fabulous.  Except... ugh, I hesitate to even bring it up.  It's not you, it's me.  Sometimes it's so busy I can't get a seat.  And, sometimes your wifi doesn't have enough oomph to satisfy.  But your goods far outweigh your bads and I'm sure that you will make other students very happy in the future.  I will always treasure the time we have already shared and looked forward to these last few months that we have in our future.  Love Always, Jen

I had heard really good things about Nello's and how great their pizza is.  I should have considered the source: a Mexican who was born in Alaska, and grew up in New Mexico.  I love the guy, but what does he know about pizza?  The service was good though.  Our waiter was totally on the ball with refills and separating our checks before we even asked.  If I could remember his name I would give him a shout out right here.  But I'll forgive bad service for good pizza, and this pizza was just mediocre. For $10 I got a 10-inch 4 cheese thin crust pizza.  It was thin and crispy and cut into little bite size pizzas.  It was more like a pizza flavored quesadilla than an actual pizza.  It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't rush back for more.

A must for all Buffalonians in the valley!  I haven't been here in a few years, so I'll have to update this the next time I go.  But the pizza tastes as if you just had it delivered from the local pizza joint.  Thicker dough than NY-style, sauce that tastes a bit heavier on the tomato paste, and Sorrento's cheese.  Wings are authentic and made with the perfect combination of Frank's and butter.  They also make Beef on Kimmelweck rolls and have Buffalo's favorite beer: Labatt's Blue.    And, the restaurant is completely decorated in Buffalo paraphernalia such as a "We're talking proud" pennant and a snow shovel hanging on the wall.

Awesome wings!  They're big and meaty, cooked to our specifications of crispy and with a really good spicy/vinegary sauce.  Actually I don't think I've ever had a bad meal at Seamus's.  It's not fancy, it's just a bar with a sampling of American and Irish food.  Service is always good.  They have a variety of booze and beer from Ireland, as well as crap beer for lame people who would dare step foot in an Irish pub and order something that isn't a Guiness/Harp/Smithwick's.  And I've had many good times at this place over the years.

O      M         G         !  Tonight there was an actual clip about how the moon was big looking.  And, to show how the moon was big looking the newscaster stood outside the local studio.  Great right?  No. He basically showed the Sandra Day O'Connor building with the moon BEHIND IT.  Yes, that's right, not in front of it, not next to it, but behind it.  Then he talked about how if you hold a dime up to the moon it still is the same size regardless of how close it is to the horizon.  Great information, right?  No.  Have I mentioned that you couldn't see the moon in his newscast?  I seriously thought that Phoenix news couldn't get any worse with the clips about rain puddles when rain occurred earlier or the 8 minutes of reviews about how the 27 degree day affected Phoenicians.  But, this was the worst news ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!   And, yes, I really did mean to add that many exclamation points.

A philosophical elder of my profession commonly says "Everyone needs three vices.  Sex and chocolate don't count."    If I still lived in Phoenix, LoLo's Chicken and Waffles would definitely be one of my vices.  The chicken is pure fried goodness. The mac n'cheese is creamy and crispy goodness. The waffles are BEYOND DELICIOUS.    If I could give any future LoLo's consumers a hint it would be this: if you are sensitive to too much sugar like I am, don't waste your precious pancreatic islets on the beverages.  I succumbed to the peer-pressure and got an Arnold Palmer, which of course comes in a quart-sized Mason jar.  I reached my sugar capacity before the meal even started.  I can only imagine the explosion of flavor in my mouth I would have experienced had I not wasted all my buds on sweetened tea and lemonade.

Considering the lack of dive bars left in downtown Phoenix, the Bikini gets 5 stars, otherwise it would get 4.  We started going there about 6 years ago when we lived in the FQ Story district.  We love dive bars, and the best time to go is during the week or on a Sunday afternoon if you really want to get a feel for the typical clientele.  I love the wackiness of this place and believe it or not, they have cleaned up the place a bit.  This was the very first bar that anyone ever bought us a drink for no reason.  The owner was hanging out with her CSI buddies and her boyfriend brought us over two beers.  In Buffalo, regulars and bartenders often buy drinks for other clientele, but we had not yet experienced this in Phoenix.  This man renewed our faith in bar etiquette.  More recently, we spent NYE here and even though I was the designated driver, I had a great time.  We walked in and before my cohort could decide what they wanted to drink, we noticed that a gentleman had left his dentures in his hat on the bar while he was about 10 feet away playing video crack.  Where else does this happen but the Bikini?  Later, my husband was outside smoking and some guy with no shoes came up to him to ask "Are you down for whatever?"  Again, where else would this happen?  And, we managed to entertain ourselves throughout the night by sending boys into the restroom to purchase postage stamp sized porn from the porn and wierd condom machine. Hilarious.  Then the bar owner started handing out fringed squakers, hats and noise makers at about 11, which meant that for an hour people were making tons of noise.  I had a blast.

***Although I'm sure that their services are wonderful, this review is about the architecture of the building.***  On our tour of Phoenix for my friend's visit, we decided to swing by the church designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.  I never expected to have access to such a beautiful structure, but after taking numerous pictures of the outside, I decided to go inside to see if it was possible to get a glimpse inside.  The church was empty but when I stepped into the nave, I saw someone sitting up on the stage.  I asked if we could come in and look around and he said yes.  Brian started taking pictures of everything and the guy never stopped us and actually moved out of the way so that Brian could take pictures of the saguaro-like stained glass behind the pulpit.  It's a gorgeous church that needs to be seen to be truly appreciated.  The church contains many of FLW's architectural signatures, such as beautiful stained glass, compress and release entrances, and many angular shapes.  It's wonderful and the people of the church were very pleasant with us.

I know everyone is going the way of Netflix these days, but I still really love Superstar Video.  They have a great selection of indie films and blockbusters, new releases and older movies.  And I love the 5 movies for 5 days for 5 bucks deal on the older videos.  It makes it so easy to rent an entire season of a TV show.  Their new releases aren't too expensive, somewhere around $3.  No cards to remember to take with you either, you just give them your name.  And, you get to support a local business that deserves your patronage.

It's a neighborhood dive bar. Cash only.  Despite its location, if you are looking for some hipster joint, this ain't it.  However, I have spent many nights in here for one reason only: Aurora.  If you ever frequented Newman's before it closed, this is the same bartender, the one with the bell and the Macho Man tip jar.  She is the best bartender of all time as long as you are respectful toward her.  And, she makes great drinks.  They have 2 pool tables, but usually one is out of order.  And they just got a fancy-schmancy jukebox.  The bathrooms are small, one toilet rooms, but it's more than enough to serve the crowd.

I have a special place in my heart for My Mother's because it was where I broke my 15 year streak of vegetarianism.  And I never had any of the alleged gastrointestinal repercussions that I anticipated.  The roast turkey is better than my mom ever made, not that it means much because my mom never cooked.  But it's still good.  The salad bar is pretty awesome too.  It's small, but they manage to fit almost every thing I could possibly want into a four foot long space.  And, they have real homeade bleu cheese dressing that tastes like bleu cheese throughout.  Not like the crappy version that tastes like ranch with bleu cheese lumps in it.  I had the pizza once and was incredibly underwhelmed.  Maybe it's better when you get it at the restaurant and not as take-out, but I'll never try it again.  It reminded me of a frozen pizza.  Today, because we're on a mission to find awesome wings, ordered some wings as our appetizer.  Our entrees came out before our appetizer.  But when we told the waiter they immediately put them in to cook to our specifications.  Then they didn't charge us for it.  Nice!  Bad service?  No, just an honest mistake that they immediately corrected.  The wings however were not that good.  They were cooked crispy like we like it and the sauce had the right ingredients, but the ratio of butter:vinegar:heat was off.  Too much butter!  I felt like I was eating wings in cream sauce it was so buttery.  It coated my mouth with an oily gunk for far too long.  Maybe I wouldn't have noticed if it actually came as an appetizer.  I still love My Mother's, particularly for the stuff that my mother should have made: turkey, chicken, meat loaf, turkey pot pie, etc.  But I would stay away from the wings and pizza.

DING DING DING!!!! We have a winner!  Yes, Phoenicians, you heard me right, I am hereby declaring a winner of the best wings in Phoenix even though I haven't been to all the restaurants that other people recommended.  There is no need. The best that another restaurant could do is come close to the yumminess available at Angie & Jimmie's, and I'm pretty sure that's not possible.  I've had plenty of adequate and good wings in P-town, but these wings are EXCELLENT!  The wings are huge and meaty, covered in a mouth-watering Frank's RedHot-based sauce, and crispy.  Just the way they should be.  I haven't had wings this good since August, when I went to Duff's while I was visiting Buffalo.  I have one teeny-tiny complaint though, A&J's sprinkles some seasoning on top of the hot wings that tastes like meat tenderizer.  I'll make a point of asking them not to put it on the wings next time.  It didn't make the wings bad, but it was a little distracting from everything else they did right.  Other things I loved: - 5 pictures of Elvis in the dining room, 2 are on velvet - The counter is a 2x4 frame covered with lattice, the exposed lights from a beam, mismatched garden chairs, inch-thick layer of dirt on the windowsill - Just like in Buffalo! - The squeeze bottle of dressing that they give you with your wings, although I'm not sure if blue cheese is available.  I'll check next time. - The place reeks of yummy-smelling pizza. I didn't have any out of kindness to the gluten-sensitive husband, but I might have to go back and buy myself a small. - The menu is simple and perfect: pizza, wings and subs - Again, just like in Buffalo!  Improvements that A&J's could make: - Kick out my neighbors and open up a second restaurant here that is only open to me. - Free food

Finally had some pizza and it was as good as I was told it would be.  Thin crust, cheesy cheese - like a good NYC slice.    Their wings didn't have any meat tenderizer sprinkled on it this time. And they are still the Best in Phoenix.

I saw Christine's review and had to throw in my 2 cents.  I love the Humane Society.  I found my first dog at the 13th and Hatcher campus and couldn't have been happier with the service and the dog.  When we adopted our second dog from a sick friend, we knew that we had to get this little girl fixed.  When she was old enough, we took her to the Dobbins campus and had her spayed.  The employees were incredibly nice and comforting and our little Layla recovered pretty quickly from the surgery.  And it only cost $60 which is phenomenal if you check with private vets.  They do it all the time, so they are pros at it.

Ignore the fact that this restaurant is in a crappy little strip mall.  Once you step inside, you are instantly transported to a beautiful, upscale Asian fusion restaurant.  My eyes were mesmerized by the hanging crystal dragon sculpture.  Our waitress was top notch.  We were all kind of iffy about what we would order, but when she described the green curry to one of my co-diners, who was about to order the red curry, we all changed our order.  And she was right on.  The green curry was delicious, probably one of the best I have ever personally consumed.  Full of vegetables, more so than the red according to our waitress, and a delicious creamy and spicy sauce.  I chose the shrimp to accompany my meal, which was perfect: large enough to not feel hosed, yet small enough to be bite-size.  I even enjoyed the to-go container, which was a reusable plastic quart.  I'm not a fan of plastic, unless it is the reusable kind, and I definitely prefer this to the horrific styrofoam containers that some places use.  The waitress was also nice enough to send us home with some extra rice (something that a lot of restaurants don't think of doing).  Only 4 weeks left at the clinic, so I'm not sure I'll have time to go back, but I'm definitely glad I went at least once.

The second time I went back to this restaurant was peculiar.  The waitress started out clingy and constantly complimenting my friend, then she became very pushy about wanting us to leave.  She brought our check with 2 fortune cookies on top, came back 2 minutes later, then tossed the cookies onto the table and wiggled the check at us.  I was willing to write off this occasion since my first was so good.  I went back for a 3rd try and actually had to walk out because the service was so bad.    Our group of 4 came in and said that we needed a table for 4.  The hostess showed us to a table with only 3 seats at it, then looked confused when we pointed out that we needed another chair.  She then showed us to another table with 3 seats, then started to walk away.  When we got her attention to point out that 3 seats are never adequate for 4 people regardless which side of the room it is on, she told us to go "wait in line" again.    Technically there was no line, but we went back up to the front to wait for a 4th chair at either table.  While we were waiting for them to get their sh!t together, I noticed that the hostess was grabbing chairs from all over the restaurant and putting it at a table that did not have all of their dining partners.  I'm no restaurant owner, but it seems to me that it would be more important to seat people WHO ARE ACTUALLY THERE!  My blood was starting to boil, but we were seated and I was willing to forgive.  We had our menus and we were ready to order, but we waited and waited.  I think it was 15 minutes before the waitress (the weird clingy one from my second trip) came to our table, we had no drinks, no nothing.  We realized how much time we were wasting and discussed getting our food to go before the waitress finally appeared at our table.  When we mentioned getting our food to go, she gave us THE NASTIEST LOOK then told us that we would have to go tell the hostess what we wanted.  I lost it.  I told the waitress that everything that we had experienced thus far was completely unacceptable and I wouldn't tolerate it.  I stood up to leave and she stood where she was (in my way), ignored me, and tried to take my dining companion's orders.  She finally backed off without even a glimmer of apology after my companion's realized that I really was leaving.   I will not go back here ever again, no food is worth this treatment.

I had the Chicken Salad which was a lovely blend of shredded cabbage, white meat chicken, peanuts, scallions, chow mein noodles, and a completely unobtrusive dressing with a sesame cracker.  It was such a great blend of textures and flavors that I thought about it all day after I ate it and can't wait to try more of their salads.  I used to get the bowls, but every one that I tried had too much overly sweet teriyaki.  I almost gave up on this restaurant, but I'm glad I didn't.  Plus one star!

I've been thinking about checking out Taliesin West for years, but I never made a point to driving out that far just to see a house.  Thanks to my friend Brian coming into town, I finally decided it was time.    We did the Insight tour which took us into Frank Lloyd Wright's office, living room, bedroom and various theaters.  It was a great tour and our guide, Betty was very knowledgeable on all things Wright.  She invited questions and never hesitated with the answers.  On the tour we even had the opportunity to sit in the furniture that FLW designed and made.  It's awesome because the site is not considered a museum, so we were able to take pictures and touch everything.  The foundation offers a variety of tours, so I will definitely be back to check out some of the other ones.  The only downside is that the tours are a little pricey, but not outlandish considering the amount of information and access you get.  Our tour was about $30 and took 90 minutes.  The longer tours cost more, but based on this one, I think it was well worth it.

Back before I was a Yelper, I lived in Tempe right around the corner from Four Peaks, and I would head over there at least weekly.  I can honestly say that I have never had a bad meal there, and that I've tried nearly the entire menu.    It's a sports bar and a brewery so it's not high-falutin' cuisine, but it is good. The burgers are big and tasty, the fries are seasoned, lightly battered and crispy.  The veggies, whether in a salad or cooked are always fresh and not overdone.  The enchiladas are delicious, the wings are good, and the pizzas are tasty but not average.  And the Sunday brunch is definitely worth heading over there to enjoy.  And the beer is oh so yummy.  A former professor of mine was the microbiologist on staff and he highly enjoyed and recommended their brew.  The building itself is pretty cool too.  It used to be a dairy back in the day, and the park next door is aptly named Creamery Park.  The jukebox plays an eclectic mix of alternative music; I've often heard They Might Be Giants, Pixies and other bands that get rare radio play.  And, it's a sports bar with plenty of TVs without being obnoxious for those of us who came for the food and brew.  The staff is ever changing, except for a few familiar faces, but always helpful and excellent.  I'd give it 4.5 stars if it were possible, but it's not.  And I can't give them 5 stars because of parking and seating issues.  This place is often too busy to handle the crowd, but in the past year they have added a host station to fairly find a seat when it's incredibly crowded.

Excellent selection of beer, wine, and booze.  It's the local mom-n-pop shop version of the BevMo less than a mile away.  Actually, my husband went to BevMo and one of the employees highly recommended T's.  But, the people working at T's are ridiculously knowledgeable about their selection.    It's small, but they pack a huge variety of alcoholic beverages into this tiny little store.  Microbrews, foreign beers from every country you can imagine, and the American staples.  A large wine selection that is varied in quality, price and regions.  And a liquor selection that goes from bottom shelf to the highest of high-end.  Are you looking for a decent tequila that isn't too pricey to thank someone for watching your cats, but you know that Jose Cuervo is much too standard to show your gratitude?  They'll help you select one that matches your budget and your needs.  You just found a bottle of wine with a cool name like "Irony" and you want to know if it's good.  The employees will let you know that it is an excellent selection without breaking the bank.  Today we were looking for wheat-free beer.  The cashier took 15 minutes to help us out, and even called his boss for his expertise on the ingredients of each beer.  They also have a good selection of well-priced kegs, a humidor, large selection of cigarettes and convenience store items such as pop, candybars and other necessities.  This place honestly deserves 5 stars.  Excellent location, excellent selection, and excellent employees.

I never would have even considered eating at this bar, but my friend tried it out first and said they had awesome burgers.  I trusted her judgement and off my classmates and I went to celebrate finishing our final final of med school.  I had the Royale with bacon.  This is one of those places you don't feel hosed for buying an $8 burger; it was huge and tasty.  The fries were definitely from real potatoes and overcooked a little so they were crispy the way I like them.  And our server was very nice and on the ball, although I think we were the only people eating or at the bar area for that matter.  I've also been here for libations, to celebrate with a bunch of friends while there was a band playing and I had a pretty good time.  They have a variety of beers on tap which is always nice.    They have some betting thing going on that keeps a bunch of regulars down on the lower level by the stage.  They have a separate pool room and a smoking room.  I definitely liked the separate sections of the bar.   I will definitely go back if I have the opportunity!

The place is so huge I've never had to wait for a seat ever.  But, I have become a little lost in the place because it is so big.  Steaks are delicious and cooked well.  I also like the fact that they are priced very reasonably.  It's cheaper to go here than one of those chain steak restaurants.  Sides are good as well.  The server's are incredibly nice and very attentive.  It's casual, yet proper.    There is plenty of free parking on a regular basis too.

I had a hankering for a sub and didn't want to visit the ubiquitous Subway.  I racked my brain trying to think of any non-chain sub shop between East Mesa and South Scottsdale.  Luckily, I remembered the Sub Factory.  If you've never been to this location before, the entrance is a bit peculiar.  From University the shop is obvious with it's two-story window and neon sign.  But the entrance isn't on the University side.  Walk towards the tattoo shop and the door is actually under the staircase and behind you.  The menu is fairly simple, as is the atmosphere.  While I was waiting for my sub, I noticed that they also have beer and happy hour specials.  I don't know if people make this a regular hang-out for libations, but if I came her in the evening, I would definitely appreciate the option.  The subs are good in a way that I can appreciate being from the East Coast.  The bread is flaky on  the outside and fluffy on the inside.  Then they bake it to give it that little extra crisp. The bread actually looked quite mangled when I got it, but the taste was awesome.  I find Subway bread to be too rubbery and chewy.  The toppings are simple and tasty. Except for the tuna, but I blame that on the fact that I haven't had tuna in 20 years.  I won't hold it against the Sub Factory, but I will definitely stick with the other sub options from now on.

I do the usual checking of every travel website to find that every one of them has a deal at the Carefree Resort and Villas for $47 per night during Labor Day Weekend.  Whoopeee!! I hit the jackpot.  This place looked nice from the pictures, the reviews on Yelp were mostly positive, and we had never been to Carefree/Cave Creek.  Pack the bags, put the puppies in a kennel and away we go.  Check in: No problems here after the guy in front of us quit hogging the desk-clerk's attention for 15 minutes or more. During this wait, we realize that the main dining room is closed and our options are narrowed down to the saloon and the Mesquite Room.  Our actual check-in took maybe a total of 2 minutes.  Awesome. Now it's time to get some grub at the "Saloon." Except the saloon is bright and clean and nice, unlike any saloon I've ever been in.  And the food? $25 per plate buffet.  At this point we were feeling a bit hosed.  Day 1: Husband uses the bathroom and the toilet won't flush so we head down to let the front desk know and go over to the Mesquite Room to get some breakfast. ANOTHER FRIGGIN' BUFFET! My husband, who eats very small meals, and even smaller breakfasts, refused to even eat.  Minus the sad excuse for a bagel, the breakfast was okay and only cost $15.  We go back to the room, and the toilet is fixed. Yay!  I use it, and again it won't flush. Boo.  Another call to the front desk, in which the clerk says that they will send someone up to fix it again.  Two minutes later, the clerk calls back to say that there is a part missing on it and that they'll switch us to a new room.  Why the runaround?  Why didn't they just do that after the first visit from maintenance revealed that the toilet was broken? But we get a new room that is allegedly bigger (by millimeters if at all) and with the upgrade of a flushing toilet.  woohoo.  Time for my long awaited, much anticipated, call to the spa to schedule a pedicure and massage.  $115 for a 50 minute massage, $70 for a spa pedicure.  I was so bummed about the outrageous prices, I took a nap watching our 15 inch television.  In an attempt to feel a little better, we head down to the pool to find it full of families and children. Eh. But the pool bar is open and serving burgers and other food.  Yay!  The turkey burger was awesome and almost helped me to forget the lame time we had been having. Few more drinks, time for a nap, you get the idea.  This is pretty much how the rest of the weekend went.  Eat, drink, nap, repeat.  One final complaint.  The room service breakfast was HORRIBLE!!!  My $14 breakfast burrito was mostly lettuce, a little bit of canned refried beans, and some unidentifiable piece of protein.  The semi-tasty guacamole helped a little, but I would have needed buckets to make it good.  Overall: If you feel like hanging out at a schticky, wild west themed hotel that has overpriced amenities, then please go here.  $47 is not a deal, it's about what this place is worth at any time of the year.

I had been really looking forward to eating at Pizzeria Bianco as my last restaurant in Phoenix.  In my 8 years here as a Phoenician, I had never set aside an evening to devote to getting a pizza here.  So for my last evening here, I made a point of going.  It was okay.  I don't think it's the best pizza in Arizona, let alone America.  It definitely wasn't worth the 2 1/2 hour wait. And it absolutely was not worth the attitude from the bitchy hostess.  I didn't like the charred bread that covered my hands and face with soot and gave the pizza a bitter and burnt flavor. And the pizza with salami we ordered was limp and soggy.  Ignoring those things, the pizza was pretty good.  And I did ignore those things because I was starving.  Maybe that's why so many people love this place - being taunted with the idea of good pizza for hours kind of skews ones perception.

Unfortunately, my birthday always falls right around Mother's Day.  Which means that every time I want to go out to eat for my birthday it is packed.  We thought we'd celebrate early by going on Saturday, but it was still packed.  We called ahead and the earliest reservation was 9 PM, but the person on the phone said that if we just came down, they would fit us in.  So we sat at the bar for maybe 20 minutes (IN YOUR FACE CHAIN RESTAURANTS!!!) and our beers came with a small appetizer of cheese and salami.  These people think of everything. And the wait staff is pretty damn attentive.  The hostess heard me say something about my birthday, which was passed on to the waitress so my super huge and yummy meal ended with a delicious dessert of my choosing.    The bread and relish tray would have been more than enough of an appetizer for me, but my partners in crime also wanted the spinach artichoke dip, which was soooo tasty.  My steak was SOFT but cooked exactly how I like it.  These are true professionals.  Asparagus was cooked perfectly.  The chicken pot pie soup was exactly what I expected and so yummy.  And the dessert?  Triple creme brulee - kahlua which tasted like a caucasian, chocolate which managed to be super chocolately but not too rich, and a mixed berry that would have been fabulous if I was a normal rasberry eating human.  Yes, it's a little pricey, but you easily get 2 meals if not more out of one dish.  Especially with the yummy bread and relish tray that is also presented before the meal.  The atmosphere is cozy and a little crowded.  If you are wierd about personal space, this is probably not the place to go.  Overall: I love this place and go every time I get the opportunity.

I wish 6 stars was an option for places like this.   Awesome decor - gorgeous cherry wood mixed with shiny diamond-plate steel everywhere, comfy and relaxing patio furniture on the patio, comfy bar stools, and even a beautiful bathroom!   Friendly patrons and super friendly staff! Our first visit there on a Tuesday afternoon one of the regulars bought my husband and I both a drink, the bartender chatted us up for awhile and really made us feel welcome, and the owner (Renee) made a point of coming over, shaking our hands, and introducing herself. I have never, ever felt so welcome at a bar before.   Renee let us know that she has open-mic nights, as well as full bands playing regularly. She has been in and around music for many years and we even had an opportunity to hear one of her songs during our short visit!   I'm so sad that I didn't venture into this place long before my departure from Phoenix. Despite this place not being walking or short-bike-riding distance from home, I would have made a point of cabbing it for the pleasure of hanging out here for real.

This was the first place that I tried wings post-vegetarianism and I loved them.  Hundreds of wings and a few years later, I still think they are pretty awesome.  Meaty wings, soaked in Harp, covered in sauce very similar to Franks - mmm, so tasty.  Everything else is good too, but I go back for the wings.    Irish beers on tap - Harp, Smithwick's (Shmittick's) and the obligatory Guiness - as well as a plethora of other libations.  I adore the waitress who always seems to serve us, with her m'love's and Irish mom ways.  She accidentally gave us our drink bill, without the food included.  When we pointed out the mistake, she brought back a bill sans wings.  Maybe she forgot about the wings, maybe she was repaying our honesty, but either way we tipped well and were grateful.

I had to up my review a star because I realized that their Huevos Con Chorizo Skillet is one of my favorite breakfasts of all times.  And we went on a Tuesday at mid-morning so it wasn't packed and the service was good.

I really wish 3.5 was an option.  Red Owl doesn't quite deserve the esteem of 4 stars, yet it is definitely not as mediocre as 3 stars.  The first time I went here I definitely enjoyed the crowd and the vibe. Punk rockers, head bangers, and the like all hanging out and having a great time together.  When I bragged to a friend of mine about how awesome this place was, she replied that she would never go there because of the lobster claw machine.  I had no idea what she was talking about, but the second time I went to the Red Owl, I saw it.  And all the horror stories that she told me (that I brushed off) came rushing back... "dead lobsters"...  "floating"...  "dirty water"...   Ugh.  This contraption is like the game where you use a joystick or buttons to move a claw around with the purpose of winning a stuffed animal.  Only this machine's purpose is to win a live (hopefully) lobster in a huge tank of murky water.  It's disgusting and cruel and they really should get rid of it.  However, I am a fan of the bar, the music and the clientele.  I stopped by for a quick visit during Metalfest and it brought back all of my childhood memories of hanging out at the SkyRoom in South Buffalo.  Death Metal, Hardcore... I felt so at home it reminds me of one of my favorite quotes.  "As if that blind rage had washed me clean, rid me of hope; for the first time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world. Finding it so much like myself -- so like a brother, really -- I felt that I had been happy and that I was happy again." Albert Camus

The food is so good.  The menu is HUGE so I always get the sample platter thing because I can never decide on one thing.  Or, I go there at lunch time to get the buffet.  The buffet is always different every time I go.  And, its vegetarian/vegan, so its always an option for the veg-heads.  I love this place despite the violations that it received last year.  I heard about it from a friend who lived in India for awhile and she said "eh, it makes it more authentic."  And seriously, what restaurant in Phoenix doesn't have roaches?  As long as I don't see them while I'm dining I don't care.  And, it's still open, so I assume that they have rectified the situation.

I was a vegetarian for 15 years, so I'm not afraid to enter a restaurant that is vegetarian or vegan.  My husband, however, is a different story.  He is not a fan of vegetables in general.  So I used my friend Brian's trip to Phoenix as an excuse to check out the place that I heard really great things about.  I ordered a tea with orange and licorice.  It was very yummy and I had a hard time choosing between all of the options.  I was very happy with the drink as well as the timer that accompanied it to insure that it was perfectly brewed.  The appetizer was so good it's hard to explain.  We ordered the crumpets which were pieces of perfectly toasted rosemary foccacia covered in 3 different spreads: white bean hummus, tomato and fennel, and garlic/artichoke.    I went with the macrobiotic platter as my entree, and Brian ordered the Jerked Tempeh.  My meal was absolutely macrobiotic, which I have dabbled in from time to time, so I wasn't surprised at the lack of spices.  The only complaint was that there are too many beans.  There is no need for anyone to consume 2 cups of adzuki beans.  No one.  The platter was otherwise delicious.  Brian loved his Jerked Tempeh.  Then there were the desserts.  I'm always willing to try desserts, but Brian was a little more discriminatory.  He asked the waitress if she was a vegan, she answered that she was a vegetarian, to which Brian said "Good, I don't trust vegans telling me that vegan desserts are good."  I found this hilarious, but so true.  She assured us that the desserts did not taste like cardboard and talked us into the blueberry cake with tofu icing and the tiramisu.    I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to tiramisu.  It's my favorite dessert, but again, I'm always willing to try dessert.  For a vegan dessert, it was phenomenal... rum flavored icing, super moist cake-y bottom.  But it is not anything like real tiramisu.   The service was great.  Our waitress was super informative and extremely helpful.  She even knew the amount of time that it would take for our appetizers to be finished.  It's a little pricey, but it was very good.  I'll definitely be back.

I really wanted to love Tradiciones.  Really.  But I didn't.   After weaving my way through the perplexing plaza that is in front of the patio in front of the restaurant (I saw a sign that said this NOT the entrance, but not one that said this IS the entrance), I finally found the entrance.  The smallish entranceway opens into a grand space that is incredibly lovely with tons of bent steel and bright colors.  I couldn't believe that I was in the same building as the Ranch Market.  I was so mesmerized by the beauty of the location, and the display of a gajillion tequilas, and the music of the roving mariachis, that almost any food set before me would have been forgiven.  Almost.  The chips and salsa were okay, but my entree was really disappointing.  I ordered the spinach enchiladas and got a bland enchilada with barely cooked button mushrooms and hardly a shred of spinach! Seriously. I expected to bust into my little rolls to find a plethora of greens, but actually had to dig and search for a mere shriggle.  And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.  But, I must confess, my partners pollo looked incredibly tasty and he said it was.  I'll have to take his word for it, because I won't be going back to try again when I could just as easily go to La Tolteca for much better food.

One night, after a particularly difficult shift at the Southwest Naturopathic Medical Center, a fellow student and I decided to let loose and head over to the bar next door, Mardi Gras.  We were just looking for a drink to wind down and possibly an appetizer.    We walked in, not knowing what to expect.  The bar is rather open and not at all crowded.  Actually, I think there were half a dozen people in there, not including the bartender Breeana.  And someone was painting the ceiling (that was a little odd at 10 PM).  After a minute to peruse the specials listed on signs all over the place, we decided on our beverages and an order of chicken wings.  Let me preface the rest of this review with the fact that I was born and raised in Buffalo, New York, home of the original chicken wings.  The wings are fantastic.  They're fried to a perfect crispiness, not overcooked and dry, nor undercooked and gummy, and definitely not breaded.  The sauce is not the original Buffalo sauce of Frank's and butter, but it is really good.  It is a perfect combo of vinegar-y-ness and spiciness.  I guess they have other flavors, but that would be heresy for me to even try.  My only complaint is that they have ranch and not bleu cheese.  Not that I often use the bleu cheese, but it's comforting to know that it's there if I want it.  And there is only carrot sticks, not carrots and celery like I'm used to.  The guy who makes the wings is super friendly and comes out to check if they were cooked right (note to self: learn this guy's name).  And the bartender Breeana (I have no idea how to spell her name) is friendly and used to work at Houston's.  This week she was making a mojito for another customer and let us try a straw-full.  It was very yummy from the bit I tasted, but I think I'm going to try it next week.    The Mardi Gras quickly became our Wednesday night ritual, and I'm going to miss the trend at the end of this quarter.  But I'm still at the clinic on other nights, so I'll just have to make it over there on a new night.

Great little bar right off of Roosevelt in a beautifully renovated home.  The walls are covered with some pretty awesome artwork too.    It's small and cozy, so if they are really busy it's not really my favorite place to be.  And, it's not a good idea to show up at the end of the night because the variety of beers is staggering and incredibly difficult to read on their menu if you've already tipped back a few.  I personally like it when it's a little slower earlier in the evening so that I can peruse the menu and try a bunch of different beers.  Overall, this place is a fabulous addition to the downtown scene.

I loved Black Hearts Bazaar Noir but they had a fire and have been closed for awhile.  Vyle, the owner, opened up this new shop farther up on 7th Ave.  It's just as awesome as Black Hearts thanks to Vyle's interest in the strange and unusual.  The store is packed with all sorts of stuff, from beautiful antiques to peculiar bric-a-brac to fun little items like Koop playing cards and a Jesus themed toiletries.  You must go here and check this place out, you will not be disappointed!

Thursday night happy hour is half off certain appetizers and drinks.  I managed to get a real margarita (NO MARGARITA MIX) and a plate full of tacos al pastor for $8.25 before tax and tip.  I was hugely impressed by being able to do this in North Scottsdale and am willing to drive back up there for a second try.

It's big and open with tons of stuff that is fairly decent.  It's clean and bright too.  The best part?  Clothing is organized by both size and color!!! I love when thrift stores take the time to do this, it makes my shopping experience so much more enjoyable.

The husband was so excited about the gluten-free pizza we had last week, that he asked me daily ever since to get another one.  I finaly relented.  So we called and ordered the exact same pizzas: one large SAUSAGE and mushroom and one large gluten-free pepperoni.  The girl on the phone informed us that gluten-free only comes medium. What?!?!?  Then she tells us that the order totals $4 dollars more than last week. ???  Then we start wondering, who was wrong? Was it the guy last week who allegedly gave us a large gluten-free that my husband loved and somehow didn't get sick from, and a onion and mushroom instead of a sausage and mushroom?  Or, the chick who seemed to be on the ball this week?  The order came rather quickly, which was nice.  My pizza was correct this time, and it was just as mediocre as the one last week but with the right ingredients.  The husband's pizza was indeed a medium and it only took one bite for him to realize that the pizza last week was NOT gluten-free.  This pizza had the crust that he anticipated last week, not good.  Not good to the point that he stopped eating the whole slice, pulled off the cheese and pepperoni and fed the crust to the dogs.  We are extremely pleased and incredibly surprised that the gluten-full pizza did not make him sick.  But, the pizza is dissappointing and not worth the $20 for a large pie.  At least now he has realized this, and we will not order from them again.

When I first moved to Phoenix, I was told that I should never eat at a restaurant that ends in -berto's unless it's Filiberto's.  And, thankfully, sticking to that rule has always ensured that I didn't get sick from a bad burrito.  But it never prevented me from getting the wrong thing on a regular basis.  I order a beef, I get pork.  I order a burrito anticipating veggies, rice and meat, and get a brick-size amount of chicken cubes in a tortilla.  I order a drink and have to finangle to receive it.  Service sucks. This location's atmosphere is parking lot full of yuppy cars from the people going to Pita Jungle or getting vegan pizza.  But the food, regardless of how different from the actual or anticipated order, is always good.

Brendan McCarthy, ND, LAc was my acupuncturist before he graduated from SCNM, and now he's my husband's doctor as well.  He's phenomenally friendly and super cool.  He'll take an extraordinary amount of time researching your case, answering your questions, and making you feel better.  He does acupuncture, herbs, hormone balancing, environmental medicine, physical medicine and a ton of IVs for any disease process you may have going on.  I'm currently doing a rotation here and have had the opportunity to see   Dr. McCarthy work with a variety of patients.  They all love him.  Today one of them even said "He's so great because he makes me feel as if I'm the only patient."   He also has a colon hydrotherapist here doing colonics and Garrett Wdowin, ND just joined the practice as well.  And, he's really good with fitting people into his schedule.  No waiting for weeks for an appointment here.

I loathe Wells Fargo.  Long lines, huge hassles, and employees not fit to be working at a fast food joint.  I had a nice employee once.  Literally, once.  Every other time, my transactions are brutally trying.  I closed my personal account years ago after getting the run-around at their downtown Glendale location.  When I opened an account for my class at this particular location (only because I had to), the business accounts employee looked mortified when I handed her a couple hundred dollars in cash to deposit.  And she almost wouldn't take the change because it wasn't in rolls until I explained the idiocy of asking me to do this when there wasn't enough of each coin to make a complete roll.  Then, she kept miscounting the amount and telling me my deposit number was wrong because she couldn't understand the concept of a $2 bill.  Thankfully, she's not there anymore because she got promoted. Yup, promoted.  I had to call the 800-number to try to get an untrustworthy person's credit cards canceled on one of our accounts.  Guess what they told me?  That they couldn't cancel him unless they had the number on the card, but we didn't have the cards with the numbers on them in our possession, thus the reason behind wanting them canceled.  After I pointed out the ridiculousness of this policy all I got was "I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do."  Grrrr! I could go on and on because every transaction at Wells Fargo has been somewhere between aggravating and enraging.

I've been here a bajillion times because I used to live up the street. I've tried every type of meat and all of the vegetable dishes.    The falafel is a little bland, but if you cover it in their garlic dip it doesn't matter.  Other than that, everything is fabulous.  The first thing I ever ate was the baked lamb sandwich and it was divine.  I just had lunch there yesterday and I'm salivating writing this review and thinking about it.  The restaurant is very nicely decorated and the family that runs the place is super nice and friendly.  I can't believe how empty this place usually is, especially since Pita Jungle is across the street and parking is impossible over there.  They have a lunch buffet but I've never partaken.

I was far too embarassed about my first visit to the Morning Glory Cafe to do a proper yelp.  My advice: don't take vitamins on a empty hangover stomach then allow your breakfast buddy to order really jiggly Eggs Benedict.  Every bump to the table was pure torture for hypersensitive gag reflex. But despite my unflattering visit to restroom trailer, I absolutely loved the food and knew I would be back.  Today I managed to convince my husband to go to the Farm for breakfast, which is a minor feat in and of itself.  But I am happy to report that the breakfast was just as awesome as I promised my hubby that it would be. - The setting is beautiful, green, and soothing - The beverages are far above average.  Coffee that doesn't get bitter as it cools and freshly squeezed orange juice. - The staff is friendly and wonderful. - The meal comes out ridiculously quick.  It makes me wonder what takes so long at other breakfast joints.   - The food is divine.  The omelets are the best omelets I have ever eaten with fresh ingredients from the farm within sight of our table.  We even heard the chickens while we were sitting there because it was early and the restaurant was nearly empty.  The rosemary potatoes are perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The hubby was equally impressed with his simple breakfast of eggs, bacon and pancakes with real maple syrup.  He even noticed that the portion size was perfect and that substandard breakfast restaurants compensate for mediocre meals with a greater quantity of food. - The meal is a bit pricey for breakfast, but I didn't mind one bit.  I can't afford regular visits but I really wish I could.  We paid $37 for two meals, two coffees and 1 screwdriver (not on the menu, but they have the ingredients). - I do have one complaint, but I'm not sure if it's really a complaint or just a personal preference.  I hate biscuits.  They taste like dehydrated unbaked dough and I have no idea why any human would willingly eat one.  Morning Glory Cafe's biscuit is as horrible as any other I have tried.  Maybe for you biscuit-eaters out there it may actually be decent. - I felt like a humungous dork for doing this, but we talked about the breakfast for hours.  It was incredibly tasty and we kept discussing it to verify that we both experienced this perfect breakfast and to reinforce our experience.

Thanks to all of the other Yelpers I was aware of the long line and busy-ness of Sunday brunch at Palatte, but I wanted to try it anyways.  The waiters were extremely helpful at guiding us through the process of ordering our food and finding a seat.  The sign in front said that there was a 45 minute wait, but I think we made it through the line in about 20 minutes.  There were no more empty tables outside, so we sat inside which was very nice as well.  Our food probably took another 20-30 minutes which actually went by rather quickly.    The food was phenomenal.  I got the Potato mish-mash and the Yoda tea iced, both were delicious.  My cohorts got the lemon curd french toast  and the Egg mish-mash and everyone was happy.  Sunday morning is probably not the best time to try it if you are a high-maintenance customer or hate waiting, but my group was aware of the situation and perfectly happy with the service.  The wait staff only delivers the drink and food orders, but ours did stop by after our food was delivered to make sure that everything was to our liking.    It's delicious and not too spendy.  I will definitely be back to try some of the other options.

Hole in the Rock: the quickest, easiest sightseeing possible in Phoenix.  A friend came to visit and was just staying overnight until lunch the next day.  We were going to be in the Scottsday/Tempe area so I figured at the very least I should take her over to Papago Park to see some of the native plants and the cool looking, bumpy red mountains.  I had never been to Hole in a Rock, but I had always seen people standing up there every time I drive by the park.  I had no idea how they got up there though.  So I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is ridiculously easy.  Half hour  to get up to and down from the hole, stairs carved into the mountain the whole way up and a beautiful view from either side.    We went at 10:30 in the morning so we were all alone up there, which was even better.

I hate capitalism. HATE!!! This place is the epitome of all things that disgust me about living in a capitalist country.  It's huge and full of everything outdoorsy, including a whole table of long-sleeve, button-down shirts with tractors all over them.   At the entrance you have to pass through an amusement park-like turnstile.  Are you kidding me?  Sections are divided by activity: boating, camping, fishing, hunting.  Ugh.  A city girl like me is completely out of her element here.  And, yes, it is as extravagant as a Las Vegas Casino.  The condescending jerk in the camping section treated me like an idiot for asking if there were any Kleen Kanteens still available.  When I pointed the label on the empty shelf that clearly designated this steel water bottle, he changed his attitude, but they still didn't have any.  Next: shoes.  I needed Teva-ish sandals for walking through rivers in NC.  Flip-flops: $30+, Sandals: $40+. Luckily I found a salesperson who was nice enough to point me to the sandals on sale for $20.  Checkout - they ask for your phone number.  Grr.  By the way, if your interested in "culture" they have a 4th Friday Artwalk notice listed at the mini-stripmall behind this monstrosity.

Wireless internet in the Destination!   A tea house in front of a fountain that people bring their kids to, specifically to play in it! Boba!  I went here for a meeting and enjoyed the place, despite its location in a mall.  The server was even nice enough to give me just a little bit of boba so that I could try it.  I could definitely see myself hanging out at this place, studying or whatever, if it weren't in a mall.  But it's still cool.

I love the porch.  They have an inside, but I've never sat in there.    The food is pretty good and the beer is awesome.  The music is from a jukebox and can be hit or miss.  One evening I was there it played 14 U2 songs in a row, which was fine with me but not my friends.

This has to be the friendliest dive bar I've ever entered.  The husband HATES Karaoke, and we still had fun here.  We saw no drama, no show-offs, no meanness, just a bunch of people on a Saturday night having a good time.  The people here were absolutely gracious and friendly.  I felt completely welcomed and encouraged to have the best time possible during my visit.  I almost never sing Karaoke, because I'm bad, but I sang two songs and received a ton of applause after both songs.  If you're a singing god/goddess, come and have fun, but this isn't a talent showcase.  The patrons were dancing to the songs and having a good time regardless of the ability of the singer.  And, I was patiently waiting to use the ladies room when a gentleman asked if I would feel comfortable using the men's room because it was open.  I told him I wouldn't mind if I could lock the door or have someone stand outside to prevent someone from walking in.  He stayed outside and waited for me to finish.  SO NICE!  I will be back to this bar.

Finally back in Phoenix with the hubby for a week or two and I have to drive up north to visit with a friend in from Buffalo to talk about networking and marketing. I need some dinner and a beer before I head to my little schmoozefest and remember that the recent Yelp Elite event (that I missed because I was out of town) was held at this place.   We find Tim Finnegans and decide that we want to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful night air after my month in the frigid northeast.  We walked in to get menus and I noticed that the place seemed huge, but I walked through and went outside so I didn't get to see much.  Outside there are numerous shiny new wooden tables with benches at which to sit.  Our waitress meets us outside and quickly takes our drink orders.  We peruse the menu for our choices, and by the time she comes back are ready to order.  We chose chicken wings as an appetizer, because that's how we roll.  The wings were meaty and pretty good.  If I were reviewing only them, I would probably give them 3.5 stars.  No Franks, but the sauce was a good combination of hot and vinegary.  They could have been a little crispier.  I ordered the Shepherds Pie, which claims to be the only authentic pie in the valley.  I'm not sure what makes it authentic, but my guess is the lamb.  I've never seen it offered as a lamb dish before.  Unfortunately, I was too full from the wings and couldn't take more than a few bites.  I'll eat the leftovers later, because from what I tasted this meat and potato dish was pretty yummy.  I'd give the whole restaurant 3.5 stars and round it up to 4 for the willingness of the owners to open an original restaurant in the land of chains.  I would definitely go back and try it again if I have time while I'm here.

A friend of mine kept telling me how wonderful Cary is, and I didn't believe her until I finally took my car to him for some repairs.    He's efficient, friendly and a great mechanic.  But most of all, he is honest.  He is the most honest mechanic I have ever dealt with.  He will not fix something without calling you first and getting your approval, he will not fix anything unnecessary, and he will tell you when and where it is best for you to spend your money.  For example, I have a 1987 Honda CRX with 270,000 miles.  It has some issues, but overall is a decent car.  I had been told by many people, friends and mechanics, that I needed a new transmission and that to rebuild the transmission would easily cost over $1000.  Cary looked at it and told me that it would cost $700 to fix a couple of different issues, including the clutch, but not the transmission.  He recommended for me to not get the transmission rebuilt on a car with so many miles, because it would probably cause more harm than good.  The CRX has been running great ever since.  Everyone has come to expect that mechanics are shady, yet Cary is almost honest to a fault.  So I tell everyone how great he is so that he can get more business to make up for the fact that he doesn't screw anyone over.

Thanks to Yelp, my BFF found this place by typing "vegan".  I'm so glad she did, it was VERY GOOD!  While we were ordering our drinks, Turbo Dog for me and Purple Haze for my cohort, the obviously Louisiana-born chef came out and asked if we had ever been there before.  I'm glad he did, because my friend is a pretty hard-core vegan and she wanted to know all of the details.  Stinky's Vegan Gumbo is not automatically vegan.  The veggie chicken isn't but the veggie sausage is, and the side of potato salad isn't, but they can substitute black-eyed peas which are. So she ordered the Stinky Gumbo without chicken, and substituted black-eyed peas for the side, which normally costs $1 extra, but the chef said we could do it, so the waitress waived the extra fee.  Whew!  It was a bit of work, but my friend was very happy to get exactly what she was expecting, and the chef was incredibly knowledgeable and courteous about her questions.  Apparently he was vegan for a bunch of years, vegetarian for a bunch more, and now just has the occasional meat to check out the quality in the restaurant. Perfect!  He even mentioned that he was trying to find a source for vegan chicken so that eventually there would be no substitutions necessary.  In our group we additionally ordered the seafood gumbo, chicken and sausage gumbo, chicken fricasee and hush puppies.  I'm no expert on what is authentic Cajun cuisine, but I do know what I like, and I liked my food a lot.  Everyone else in the group was equally pleased with their dishes.  My big bowl of chicken and sausage gumbo (which I've never had before) was full of chicken, andouille sausage and okra in a spicy soup base with rice.  The okra wasn't even slightly slimy, which was what I was expecting after years of hearing about this much maligned vegetable.  The black-eyed peas were equally spiced and delicious.  My husbands fricasee was a chicken and potato stew with rice and had a slower, but equally significant amount of heat.    There was a poker tournament going on, so we were really the only diners at the time.  I'm sure that accounts for the level of attention we received from the chef, but it was definitely appreciated.  He came out after we had a chance to sample our meals to make sure that we were happy, and we were.  He also let us know about other social events that he would bring to the location: a variety of bands from metal to country as well as poker tournaments and the like.  The beer was awesome too.  The two brews that my cohort ordered, TurboDog and Purple Haze are both made in Louisiana.  TurboDog is frighteningly dark-looking, without the heavy dark beer taste, think Amberbock if it was actually a good beer.  The Purple Haze is a lighter beer with a slightly peculiar aftertaste, but I only had a sip so I'm not sure what a whole glass would taste like.  The menu contained 3-4 other entrees that I would love to go back and try.  I can't wait to go back!

I have to admit, I had my doubts about another chain coffee shop moving into the Phoenix area.  But this shop has alleviated my fear.  I met the guy who runs the place at a networking event and he gave me a handful of free beverage cards.  Of course I used them to check the place out and was very impressed with the good service and good coffee.  I visited recently for the first time as a paying customer and I was twice as impressed.  I asked the barista if they had iced tea.  They only have Yerba Mate, which is not really my fave, but I was willing to try again.  They have a ton of flavors and can make it for you or they have it for sale in bottles.  I chose the freshly brewed chai flavor.  While I waited for my tea to steep for a minute the barista cashed me out and then said "Do you want one of the bottles for free just so you can try it?"  I love you Dutch Bros.  And, they revived my faith in Yerba Mate.  The bottled stuff was sweetened but not too much and pretty tasty.  The brewed beverage was much tastier to my buds.  They have a very convenient and quick drive-thru at the corner of Lemon and Rural.  Or you can walk up to the window to order and sit at the outside tables.  They do not have indoor seating.  I'm not saying that they always give away free stuff either.  But they do have excellent service and good products.

While my husband was unemployed, we decided to head to a bar for an early morning beverage.  Actually, it's not as bad as it sounds.  Our friend Dave, formerly a bartender at Newman's downtown, works at this bar from 6 to 10 AM.  So we decided to check it out while we both had a morning free.  We headed to 59th and Missouri because we knew that it was near that intersection.  Dave and I had a few chats because one of my funeral homes was across the street from a trailer park, and these people were also frequent customers of his bar.  However, we couldn't remember the name of the bar.  But, all of Larry's (the owner) bars exude a bit of seediness (Garnett's Rite Inn, Newman's) so it wasn't hard to figure out.  From the outside, it looks like a typical dive bar: plain brick building, aging sign, no windows.  We drove around the back and saw that the door was open, so we parked back there instead of out front.  Before our eyes even had a chance to adjust to the darkness we heard "What the hell are you guys doing here?"  Ah, Dave and his demeanor.  I miss that East Coast smartassitude.  Once our eyes did adjust, I was pleasantly surprised by our surroundings. This place is fairly big for a dive bar with multiple pool tables and a rather long bar.  We weren't there long enough for me to check out the bathrooms though.  Sorry, if I was thinking about Yelping while I was there, I would have.  But the rest of the bar seemed pretty clean and not scary.  The husband and I ordered a cup of coffee and chatted with Dave about the idiosyncrasies of this bar.  Apparently the building is big enough that they are going to build a smoking room on the north side of the building.  And, they just got a fancy new contraption that makes Guiness cans taste like Guiness draught.    It was interesting enough during the day that we are considering a trip over to the west side for an evening.  We're thinking the Friday after the first of the month will bring out all of the locals, then we'll get to see this bar in all of it's diveyness.

Really cute little cafe and espresso bar with beer, wine, and booze.  I just went to grab lunch real quick, but I decided to stay and eat since I had a few extra minutes.  The iced tea was really good, unsweetened with a hint of some fruit, maybe peach.  I ordered the portobello sandwich and substituted a side salad for the fries or pasta.  The sandwich was a grilled mushroom with cheese and pesto on grilled bread.  The salad was a garden salad with romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, shredded carrots, shredded cheese, croutons and my requested balsamic vinaigrette.  Simple yet tasty.  I enjoyed my meal but I would make one suggestion: put a piece of lettuce between the mushroom and bread. My bottom piece of bread got a bit soggy.  It still tasted good, but if I took it back to the clinic like I planned, it would have become mush.

Salad Creations is the bastard child of Cold Stone Creamery and Sweet Tomatoes.  They even have a crazy spatula-esque contraption to chop up the meat into more bite-sized pieces within your salad.  I'll admit, I was slightly overwhelmed at first, but it wasn't too confusing and the employees are incredibly patient and helpful.  So I decided to have the full sized salad, which ended up being much bigger than I could actually handle.  Next you choose the greens from four different bins hanging behind the the employees: mixed greens, romaine, spinach, and ugh, iceburg.    The employee puts the chosen greens into a large mixing bowl, and adds as many options as you choose.  I believe the menu said there were 40 options, but I'm not sure if that included the meats and dressings, or if it was just the vegetables.  Meat costs extra and they have handful of varieties of them.  Shrimp and Wild Alaskan Salmon cost extra. **record screech** Did I just see Wild Alaskan Salmon? Not that crappy farm-raised garbage that is full of pesticides and other toxins?  Whoa!  Now I'm impressed.  I take my lovely salad down to the register and decide to splurge on a cookie.  The cashier points out to me that the cookie is outdated, but says that if I still want it, it's free. BONUS!  And even though that cookie was dated the day before I bought it, it was a moist and incredibly delicious oatmeal raisin cookie.  Maybe eventually I'll tire of this place for salads, but with so many possible combinations of veggies, meat and dressings, I'm guessing it won't be for awhile.

I've heard so much about the Waffle House from my husband who was formerly a truck driver, and my friends from the south.  That's it.  No one else raves about it because it's not good.  No offense to my friends with all the melanin, I'm sure if I actually liked waffles or pancakes, I might enjoy this place.  But the idea of liquified sugar on an empty stomach makes me want to gag.  Actually syrup at any time of the day is gross.  And the rest of the food is bland.  Blander than Denny's and way worse than IHOP.  You would think that eggs and hash browns wouldn't be so hard to make, but I've never tasted anything with so little flavor.  That must be why they offer it smothered, covered, etc. because the actual vehicle/food has so little taste that it actually sucks the ability of tasting anything out of your tastebuds.  There are so many decent breakfast joints around, I have no idea why anyone would purposely go here.  Except for the fact that it's in front of the Red Owl and you might be able to go here after you drank way too much and wouldn't know the difference anyways.

Overpriced, dirty, and bad service.  But they have a semi-decent booze section.  If I'm renting a movie at Superstar, my husband often talks me in to stopping at Basha's instead of Safeway.  I often argue against it.    I've never had a decent experience here and it's not like I'm looking for much.  Give me what I'm looking for, at a decent price, with a minimal amount of hassle and I'm happy.  But everytime I go to this place it's a f'in travesty.

This is a great facility and completely trustworthy.  The first time we had to board our two poopie-monsters I was extremely nervous about it.  So my husband went down to the place to check it out.  The owner eased both of our minds and assured us that our dogs would be well taken care of.  They have individual cages for the dogs that allow them to move freely between the indoor cooled area and the outdoor yet shaded area.  Someone takes them out a couple times each day to play in a bigger fenced in area.  They also have someone staying there at night and on Sunday when they are closed so that the dogs are never alone.    The owner highly recommends bringing some blankets and toys from home so that they can have the familiar smell around them.  We chose to keep both our dogs in the same cage because they are never apart.  He also suggests bringing your own food if your dog is picky.  In addition, he informed us that they only use non-beef dog food at their facility because the switch between beef and non-beef is what gives them diarrhea (Good to know!!).  Elite is also a grooming facility and they will wave the fee for the day of pick-up if you choose to have your puppy groomed.  I highly recommend this facility, my dogs came home clean and happy from their first and second visit to this location.

The service was good. It was clean. And it was very, Very, VERY full of a ton of really old people.  I haven't seen this many old people in the same place at once since my last trek to Sun City.  But I didn't hold the old people factor against One Eyed Dog. I like old people. I had a minor in gerontology in undergrad.  It was just a little peculiar.  On a Friday night, I felt a little like I was sitting in a nursing home cafeteria.  Then I noticed that this place was supposed to be a British pub.  And their decorations seemed a bit, um, TGIBritain.  But I'm no expert on what is an authentic British look, so I didn't hold that against them either.  But the food was unimpressive.  I wasn't really hungry, and I joined my guests late, so I just sampled what my husband ordered.  The wings were peculiar.  I wasn't there when he ordered, but I'm sure that he asked for the wings to be crispy.  This is the first time that I ever had wings that were too crispy.  They were dessicated.  And the sauce was adequately hot, but too vinegary, and with a peculiarly flavored vinegar.  Maybe they used malted vinegar?  I've never tasted an octogenarian, but I imagine this is what they might taste like.  The few fries I tasted were like frozen french fries that I could easily make at home.  Our friend ordered the fish fry sandwich, Walleye, which he seemed pleased with.  The waitress told us that the fish fry dinner was even better with the sides.  I'll take her word for it, she was very nice and efficient.  It's near our friend's place, so if he suggested it again, I wouldn't say no and I would definitely stick with the fish fry dinner.  But I won't be rushing back.

I haven't been to a Ruby Tuesday's since the early 90's, back when a bunch of restaurants that all looked and sounded the same opened(TGIFridays, et al).  You know, the kind of restaurants that make the servers wear "flair," has a bunch of obnoxious crap on the wall, and has gimmicky sounding food.  I wasn't really impressed then, which is probably why I haven't been back in 15+ years.  But, I have this friend who is a really picky eater and ends up eating at the same restaurant 80 times in a row, finally tires of it, then moves on to the next restaurant where he repeats the process.  His current fave is the newest addition to the corporate monstrosity that is the Tempe Marketplace.  Because he's the picky one, and he's usually driving, we let him pick the place.  I wasn't thrilled to go to Ruby Tuesday's.  I kept having Office Space flashbacks of that dorky kid at Chotchkie's doing the finger-as-a-gun shooting thing.  Ugh.  So when I walked into the tastefully decorated restaurant with a rather large and decent salad bar, I was surprised. Our group of 5 was seated at a nice dining table that was off to the side a little bit instead of being crammed into a booth or in the middle of the dining room.  Our waitress was nice and accommodating to our needs, especially when it came to paying the bill, which they do with great efficiency.  And, I'm a huge fan of salad bars. Especially when they have a selection of vegetables that is not limited to iceberg lettuce and dehydrated cucumbers.  I made myself a beautiful salad with mixed baby greens and a variety of colored vegetables. No offense to the staff, but my friend ordered a salad from the menu, and my concoction was wwwwwaaaaaaayyyyyy better looking.  I could easily have been satisfied with my vegetable artistry, but the lunch special entree included the salad bar.  So for $15 (tax and tip included) I had 2 turkey "sliders", french fries, a gorgeous salad and an iced tea.  Thankfully, one of our cohort helped me out with the meal, because there was no way I could finish all of it.  I admit I was wrong to be so judgemental. I'm sorry Ruby Tuesday, you deserve more credit than I gave you.  And to make it up to you, I promise to return and lay down more of my husband's hard earned cash.

So the husband has taken my yelping as a mission to find new and better places recently. Going to the Copper Door was his idea, but I won't hold it against him.  On a Sunday night for dinner this place was EMPTY. Well, not completely empty, there was one other couple in the entire restaurant.  The atmosphere is beautiful: wonderful photographs of old Phoenix, a baby grand piano, and the most beautiful ceiling tiles I've ever seen (not that I make a habit out of looking at the ceiling).  We both ordered the iced tea, and it was incredibly delicious.  I have a feeling that they add just a shriggle of sugar to cut down on the typical bitter flavor of tea, without making it sweet.  As Maria F. states, the menu does claim to have vegan options.  I saw three that were labled vegan, although one contained honey.  I would doubt their understanding of what is vegan food.  Then came our meals.  Mine was the artichoke and cheese stuffed ravioli with shrimp, or at least it was supposed to be.  When the waiter brought out my dish, it was just  plate of raviolis.  I thought at first that I misunderstood, and that maybe the shrimp was inside the pasta.  So I tried to cut open the pasta and I had to put muscle into it.  To my dismay, no shrimp.  I told the waiter that I ordered shrimp, he looked confused and said he would be back.  He came back 3-5 minutes later to say that he would take my plate and be back.  About 10 minutes later I get the same dried-out, hard pasta raviolis with 4 shrimp.  The waiter said he put extra on.  Extra what?    The husband's well-done burger was medium at best.  While I was waiting for my food, he said that he had eaten better and larger burgers at Seamus's next door.  Luckily, the waiter didn't charge us the full $17 for the man's undercooked meat patty and a side of cottage cheese, just $10.  And he didn't add the $5 to my $17 dish for the shrimp, not even the extra one.  And the hostess saw us at Seamus's afterwards and was dissappointed about our experience.  She was very helpful, nice and gave us a 15% off coupon for lunch which she said was very good and not as pricey.  I might give them another chance, but it won't be at dinnertime.

The Williamson Gang is a band of gypsies, so it's no wonder that we tend to move a lot: it's the way of our people.  I lived at this complex a few years back, and I did not have the best experience.  It's nearly impossible to get cell phone reception probably due to the parking monstrosities next to the apartments.  The office people intentionally mislead us about the security insurance policy - it is not the equivalent of a security deposit - so that when we left we owed them a ton of cash because they claimed that we ruined their crappy shag carpet.  No amount of contact with the local office staff or their corporate overlords ever rectified the situation, so we paid the fee to avoid having a blemish on our renting history.  I regularly curse at the building as I'm going by the convenient location.  I would never recommend this complex to anyone, but my friend, who was my roommate at the time that we lived at Camden, decided to give them another try.  Cell phone reception is still horrible, he has to leave his phone on the window sill.  His $800-a-month one-bedroom turned into nearly $1000 per month due to all of their mandatory fees.  Fees include valet garbage even though he has to walk by a dumpster to get to his car, mandatory $45 basic cable and so on.  Oh yeah, and when he moved in his apartment had ants, something that should have been inspected and cleared before he moved in.  This place gets two stars because of location and a very nice clubhouse with an adequate gym.  But the service is HORRIBLE!
