This place is great! Let's start with the food.. I began with the springrolls which were awesome. The marinated beef added in is a great touch. I then had the chicken soup, the broth was bursting with flavors. Just enough cilantro and green onion. The pho here is what I have been looking for around ASU.  Don't forget about the employees! Great people with in hearts.. with great food ad welcoming staff I want to run back right now! Thanks for making my first visit enjoyable, I will be back soon!

For the 40$ a head you pay for all the meat and salad you can eat, this is a heaven for a 20 year old guy!! I have been coming to this location for a few years now during birthdays and special occasions with family. One thing I have voiced is how the employees have remained the same throughout the years!  Since working in the reasturant for about 3 years I have witnessed constant overturn at my job, but Fogo has kept the same hard working people hustling and bustling to please the customers needs. This also falls on management! Employees enjoy being there, whenever that happens, food will have more love and quality to it.   All in all I love going to Fogo for the culture I feel I am absorbing by talking with the staff and indulging in the food.

Do not ever come to this AJ's for dinner after 6:30 pm...... Yes 6:30 people...  Pizza looked as if it had been sitting out for 3 hours under a heat lamp (dry and disgusting)   Entree station had nothing!! The heat lamps were off and there was literally nothing there.  Soups were on their last stand with little to nothing left, unless you wanted the Italian wedding soup which tastes like nothing more than a chef boyardee canned delight.  After realizing there were no options for already prepared food, I decided to get cheese, crackers, and........ Oh to my amazement the olive station had already been closed down too! They had all been taken away and covered with metal baking sheets...   All of the other AJ's in the valley are always keeping the food fresh and presentable. The employees at this location just worry about what time they can leave for the day..  I will never return to this location ever again for dinner.. Off to the pinnacle peak location!!

Great hip spot to throw back some cold local beers with the boys. With the weather getting better, take advantage of the cool patio.  I normally get the turkey burger and love it. Sweet potato fries are crispy hot succulent and overall bomb.com!  I'm not married but if I was this would be a great local spot to get away from the wife and watch the game

Great food.  Great people.  Great drinks. Great tunes.  I cannot tell you how many great nights I have had here with friends!  There is a live band on Fridays at 7:30 rocking out to classics.  The whole staff is fun and energetic!  I enjoy hanging out on the patio and enjoying the purple mountains majesty during sunsets.
