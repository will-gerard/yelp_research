I've been to the phoenix symphony a handful of times now and I always leave wanting to go back. There are no bad seats in the hall.The staff is completely professional and generally very friendly.   Here's a couple of tips if you want to go.  1) Bring cash for parking. I'm not even sure where you would go if you didn't have any cash to park. It'll cost roughly $12 to park in any of the nearby structures.  2) Keep an eye out for discounted tickets.  the 2013-2014 season has been exceptional in regards to special offering for tickets.  This is probably because of their lack of real musical direction while they search for a new Music Director/Conductor. Try the symphony's website or living social for deals. 3) Take a coat. It can be cold in the hall. If you're a guy, you should especially bring one for your girlfriend who will inevitably get cold and take it.

I love this place!  Overall, their food is great and the lunch specials are a real bargain. The staff is polite and attentive and won't leave you waiting for much, The complimentary hot tea is excellent. I make it to dragon palace for lunch whenever I can.  The interior of this place is something else.  the walls are red and turquoise with gigantic  reliefs of Chinese themes scenes.  Its a family run business and not everybody speaks English, so be prepared to order by letter on the men

KO's is a north Scottsdale staple at this point. Its located in the same lot as the Scottsdale Gun Club tucked away on Northsight just north of Raintree. There aren't a lot of options for sports bars in that neck of the woods and I'm happy to report that their food is better than average. I'm a huge fan of their chicken pesto sandwich. French fries, onion rings and chicken tenders are always fried to perfection and served with cold ranch dressing. The atmosphere is pretty casual but still maintains some class with its somewhat eclectic industrial decor.   Overall, Its a pretty good place to grab lunch and a couple of drinks.

I love Four Peaks. The Grill in North Scottsdale is much closer to my house than the Tempe Brewery and it is air conditioned. It's the best place to go in the summer to get your Kilt Lifter.

It's hard to believe that 3 great places to eat inhabit the intersection of 15th avenue and McDowell, but along with The Original Hamburger works and Persian Garden, this place is really good.   They serve sandwiches mostly and they are very good. The Bread and the Meat taste fresh and you get the feeling these guys are have been doing this along time.  the restaurant itself is small but not uncomfortable. Vintage newspaper and political advertising adorn the walls. This and the abundance of wood trim give the place an aged atmosphere in the best kind of way.   I would gripe that you have to go to the back of the restaurant to order from the counter. There's no signs indicating that, so don't just sit down and wait for service.

Cibo is a cozy little gourmet pizzeria hidden away in an old neighborhood. The pizza is excellent. I would encourage you to try anything on the menu, even if it doesn't sound appealing.  They really know what their doing and if they've put pear on a pizza, you better believe it was for a good reason. The ambiance is great, especially outside when weather permits. they have a respectable wine selection and this is a great place to take a date.

If you're sitting around browsing yelp on your phone and think you're just going to give these guys a call to have them bring you a little something... DON'T DO IT!!!  Stop right now and go to their actual website to get the real prices since they're almost twice what is list in the in the yelp app. Second, be aware that I ended up paying an additional 5 dollars on my order to use a credit card after they tacked on some fees for credit processing. If you were wondering, that practice used to be disallowed by the Credit card companies, but they recently changed policy.  The lady rushed us through our order and didn't verify what we wanted. We ended up with a huge regular pizza at our door instead of the gluten free pizza we had wanted. She didn't give us our total over the phone and she failed to mention all the extra fees which added up to $ 7 after the deliver fee.    Fees were roughly 20% of our bill just to have some pizza delivered that wasn't even what we wanted and came out to twice the expected price of our total order.That's something that should have been communicated to me before there's a guy standing at my door wanting to get paid.  If Mamma Mia wants to stay in business, they need to be much more honest in their business practices.

We came here as our splurge meal on a Christmas visit to the Strip.  The view is as incredible as you would expect and the service is excellent.  We started with the lobster bisque which I am still drooling over a month later.  We ordered from their limited menu and the food was well prepared, though not the best I've ever had.  The restaurant itself wasn't very lively and dimly lit making for a romantic setting. The staff was willing to take our picture and there was a professional photographer about to sell you quality prints at a not very modest price.  If you're looking for an elegant quiet dinner with a great view of the strip, this is the place you are looking for.

I go here almost weekly for lunch with co-workers. It's everything you want in a Mexican restaurant: bottomless fresh chips and salsa before your food comes, enormous portions of delicious Mexican dishes, and a very attentive and polite staff. I've tried every lunch special on the menu and they will all leave you satisfies and ready for a siesta.

I was un-impressed. I had reserved a non smoking suite with a king bed. When I arrived, I was told they did not have any available (hooray for making reservations) ... I was offered a King in a smoking room or 2 queens in a non-smoking room. I settled on the 2 queen option and hustled along outside to get in my car and told to follow some guy. Along the way he pointed at the elevator I was supposed to take and he guided me to a parking space that was a pretty decent walk from the aforementioned elevator.  Once I parked and retrieved my own luggage, he shouted at me from his car asking if "I even wanted a hand..." I told him I could probably manage. After he left, I realized he never gave me a the map I asked for.   The room was underwhelming. There was no refrigerator or safe which forced me to walk back to my car to secure my valuables and settle for less than chilled beverages for the evening.  I later found that some of my friends who bought the same package as me were provided with vouchers for breakfast ( I wasn't) and they even got the room they reserved... Lucky them.    I had a fabulous view of another room's balcony the was probably about 25 feet directly across from mine. So much for those award winning views...  Frankly I'm not sure how they justify charging so much. There are plenty of great hotels in the valley that will provide you with more amenities for less money. I won't be staying here again.

Overall, I think Caesars is beginning to show its age. We were comped a few rooms here and reversed a single King room non-smoking.  When we arrived, we were told they didn't have a king room that was non-smoking. I was told that the comped rooms just have to take what we could get and we were given the choice of a smoking king or a non-smoking double queen.  But we didn't let the fact they didn't actually reserve a room spoil our good time and took the double queen.   The room was pretty standard for Vegas: Wildly overpriced minibar, missing do not disturb sign, and room service only mistakenly barged into our room once. That last one gave me a pretty scare.  On the plus side, Caesars has great water pressure, a central location on the strip and the absinthe show there is incredible. Unfortunately for them, I spent most of my time enjoying other casinos and restaurants that belonged to other hotels.  If I were paying, I would stay elsewhere.

I've been coming here for plants since i bought my house in 2009. The staff here is super knowledgeable and are very eager to share their experience. The plants I've bought here have always been healthy and they provide plastic and trays to transport your plants if you don't have a pickup or an SUV.  Their prices are competitive with the big box home improvement store and they have a rewards program to boot.

Great food, terrible dining room.    Carolina's has excellent, cheap and very filling food.  Their Carne asada is done right and flavorful and their tamales are the best readily available options in an area saturated with fast Mexican food.  The interior of this place looks exactly how you would expect a place that churns our a ton of delicious and super cheap food.  It's packed and dirty.  I'd almost suggest they give up on trying to keep everything clean themselves and just leave out a bucket full of bleach water for everyone to use.  Maybe someone with some crazy OCD would wander in every so often and wipe the tables down.    I suggest you call ahead. The lines can get long and there's a separate register for people who called where the food is distributed away from where the masses order.

If you would like a decadent breakfast but don't want to wait in the line for the buffet, you won't go wrong coming here.  We split a quiche and apple crepe and a chocolate croissant and they were all delicious.  The staff could have been a little more attentive as I had to return  to the counter for the water I had asked for with my order and to fetch some silverware which was out.   If this were a local cafe, I would probably find myself here on occasion getting breakfast.

This place has everything you want in a first class dining experience. the atmosphere is classy and refined.  The building is enormous but the tables are spread far apart for an intimate dining experience even if seated in the middle of the restaurant. Our server Eugine was not only knowledgeable but excited about the options on the menu and very attentive.  This is hands down the best fish I've had in phoenix.  The Sashimi is fresh and served on a bed of crushed ice to ensure you get a crisp and delicious serving.  Being a sochu house, I tried some of their namesake.  My Sochu came with one large crystal clear ice cube that kept my beverage cold until it was finished.   Clearly no attention detail has been spared and they will ensure you enjoy your dining experience.  I only wish i could eat here more often.

We went to Salty senorita after a cousin's graduation. The atmosphere is nice and the place is huge. The food was just ok. the menu is a limited selection of tacos and burritos. the service was mediocre at best. They need to talk to someone about supply chain. they didn't have any Tonic for my vodka tonic or any Captain Morgan for a capt and coke. It seems outrageous to me that a huge bar could be out of such staples on a Thursday night.

Pretty decent sushi and a lively atmosphere.   It's kind of surreal being served hot tea and sake in what essentially feels like a night club, but it works here.  We went on a Saturday night and there was a short wait for a table for 2. Having sampled a few rolls, I would peg this place as a good option for sushi if your in the area. The fish was fresh and our tea cape out piping hot.  Service was excellent and I was never left looking for some one.  Our waitress was knowledgeable on the menu items and made some good recommendations. I will definitely make my way back here in the future.

My girlfriend and I stayed in the Clarendon for a little staycation and managed to have both dinner and breakfast here.  Dinner: We were there during happy hour. We both got cocktails and tacos. The "El Julio" was delicious, like a little alcoholic key lime pie in a glass. The carne asada tacos were good, but nowhere near as good as the grilled shrimp tacos. We split a lime tart which was both way bigger than I expected and very tasty.  Breakfast: They serve Lux coffee which is always good. I got the Chilaquiles and it was simply a mountain of crunchy tortilla, perfectly frilled chicken, cheese and the perfect amount of heat from the green sauce.  Overall I would call this place a little Gem and a good place to take some visitors for a bit of Arizona chic.

I came here because this place is within walking distance of my house and it had good yelp reviews. Unfortunately, they did nothing to earn my continued business.  I took a road bike in here that belonged to my girlfriend's dad that hadn't been used in a couple of years. Due to the neglect, I wanted to have it checked out and tuned up and have the tires replaced so I could start riding it.   I'm not sure where all these alleged friendly staff were to greet me when I walked in, but they didn't find me.  I was directed to the back of the store to talk to the guy about having my bike fixed. and he took it. and gave it a glance. It was going to be $65, which was a little more than everyone else quoted me, but I would prefer to support businesses in my area and not drive to Tempe.   I went back and Picked up my bike 2 days later.  Good thing too, the store would have been closed the next day for some annual employee thing and if I had waited I wouldn't have had my bike for the weekend.  I mentioned I was lucky I made it in, and the guy assured me they let everyone know they were going to be closed.  Apparently I wasn't included in "everyone."  My total bill was something like $135 after they replaced both the tubes and tires as well.   After riding for about a week, i noticed the bike wouldn't stay in gear properly because of some weird tension on the cable.  Upon closer inspection, the gearing linkage was improperly reinstalled. At this point, I can't say I would recommend this place to anyone. Their service is disappointing and their prices are a little high.

My Girlfriend and I eat here occasionally and the food is consistently good. The chicken Satay is tender and the Papaya salad tastes fresh.  The servings are large and filling.  We typically order our meals carryout and we can usually pick up the order in 15-20 minutes. The interior looks clean and modern and you can see the kitchen if you look, which is always nice.  If your in the mood for some Thai, you won't find anything better nearby.

This is everything you want in a Vegas show. You have a raunchy comedy duo, acrobatic insanity, a sultry female singer and some.... suggestive themes.  The tent set out outside of Caesar's is actually as small as it looks so you can't get far from the action. The back section is elevated to don't skip this one if you are looking to save a little money by getting some discounted tickets. If you get too close to the front, be prepared to be part of the act and you better have a good sense of humor.   If you're like me and went to yelp to decide which show to see, this is definitely the one you want.

I was super excited when I saw a groupon come up for this place. I had heard it was really good from more than one person. Man, was I mislead.  My Girlfriend and I started out with some edamame and miso soup. Both of those were pretty good, but not what I came for. We ordered 4 rolls: spicy tuna, avocado eel,  a deep fried one with peanuts and a samurai roll which consisted of a bunch of fish wrapped in seaweed. They ranged from bland to average.  The Samurai roll was the worst offender and I'm sorry to say that we didn't even bother to eat all of it.  I don't think I'll be finding my way back here for sushi any time soon.

There's finally a place to have some good breakfast that isn't a chain in north Phoenix.   I've been here a few times now and I'll admit that everything I've tried is really good. But, if you really want to get your money's worth, come with a sweet tooth. Their pancakes and french toast are amazing.  When the menu says you get 2 slices of french toast, it doesn't mention that they cut the loaf of bread the long way and you're going to get a literal pound of delightful fried bread goodness.  Get some orange juice while you are at it. A lot of places claim to have fresh squeezed orange juice, but here you see the squeeze it and you can really taste the difference.  I urge everyone to come here, I'll risk a wait to make sure this place stays open!

These are some messy fish taco's so leave your dignity at the door.   The food taste fresh and is very wholesome.   The mango salsa paired with the wasabi make for a great flavor. Definitely the best fish tacos in the area.

Oh man, that was some good pizza.   My buddy and I picked up a veggie pie for the Cardinals game and these guys make a serious pizza.  at 16 bucks for an extra large it's not super expensive either.  Their cheese was authentic and delicious.  The sauce was rich and flavorful and their crust was just the right amount of crunchy and doughy.   We called ahead and our order was done in the promised 15 minutes when we arrived to pick it up.  I will definitely be getting more pizza from here.

I made reservations at The Gladly for Valentines Day and I regret nothing.  The restaurant was very busy but did not feel crowded. There were balloons and flower petals on the table.  The Prix Fixe menu feature a selection of their dishes for what I thought was a pretty reasonable price.   I had the Chopped salad and it was amazing. The salmon was fresh and finely chopped and there was some freeze dried corn which provided a great texture to compliment the otherwise mushy conglomeration.  The Steak was superb. It was grilled to perfection with an herb butter.  The mashed potatoes and other accoutrement were equally delicious.  We tried both the available desserts.  One was a coffee brownie and the other was a bread pudding.  Personally, I'm a huge fan of brownies, but in this case i would say the Bread pudding stole the show.    I honestly can't wait to find an excuse to splurge just a little and come back here

So I was super excited when a new middle eastern restaurant opened up within walking distance. Unfortunately, I'm left pretty disappointed.  To the staff's credit they were incredibly polite and the service was great. Unfortunately the food was simply bland, especially the hummus. I'm pretty sure they just ground up some chickpeas and called it a day.  Also the food took way longer than it should have.  The cook must be pretty new to this whole restaurant thing because they only cooked one meal at a time. I had to watch them cook and serve the 2 other people who arrived before me one by one in order.  Given that pretty much everything served here is either already prepared or grilled, they should be able to prepare multiple orders at once.  I'll try them again in a couple months just to be fair, so I hope some garlic and spices finds it way in to their food.

A buddy and I came here for lunch after a weekend project.  I ordered the signature hammered hog sandwich with the macaroni and cheese.  The pork on the sandwich was dry and a little tough.  There are only 2 barbecue sauces to choose from and I wasn't particularly impressed with either. The sandwich had a ranch slaw that was OK and the bun was grilled. Unfortunately I had to disassemble the whole thing to put sauce on the meat and by the time I was done trying to reconstruct it, it was a soggy mess. The macaroni and cheese was home made but not especially good.   The waitress left me with an empty glass of Dr. Pepper for quite a while and it took a longer than I would have liked to get our check taken care of.  Overall I'd say mediocre service and mediocre food.

Finally! A fox-con that lives up to the hype.  My girlfriend and I came here new year's eve before making our way to a party later in the evening. The Henry is spacious and its classy interior is eclectic without being whimsical.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and didn't hesitate to recommend only the most expensive items on the menu. So I wouldn't recommend just saying yes to whatever they recommend to drink or you might end up with a $200 bottle of sparkling rose.   Everything we tried on the limited New Year's Menu was fantastic.  The Cheese popover with the ham butter was unique. I would highly recommend the short rib. It's a true short rib in a delicious bourbon sauce that you can cut with your fork. Try the cauliflower polenta too. It was bright and buttery.   This place is going to be a mainstay of the area and perhaps the most successful of the Fox concepts in the city.

There's a little gem tucked away in "downtown" Litchfield Park.   Brewery is a little bit of a misnomer here as it's actually a tap-room and there isn't any beer being brewed in the modest space.(EDIT: I've been informed they actually do brew the beer here so the batches must be pretty small)  The interior is spartan, with high top tables that are just slightly too close together and a couple of chalk boards to give you the low down.  I tried the "Red Ale", "Pale Ale" and the "Chocolate Oatmeal Stout".  Clever names to come, I'm sure.  They were all very good.  The stout was rich, the Pale was malty, and the Red was flavorful.  This place doesn't have a restaurant attached to it, but the ladies who work here will happily make \ a sandwich or provide a meat and cheese tray at a moderate price.   Too bad the beer is so good, as I was hoping I wouldn't have to make the long drive more than once. I guess I'll have to make the pilgrimage on occasion to make sure they stay in business.

We came here for lunch on a Thursday. The place wasn't very busy but service was so slow. it took nearly 45 minutes from when we arrived until we received our food.  otherwise the service was pretty good.  My drink was never empty and the staff punched our lunch cards extra and apologized for the wait.  I got the boneless wings and they were just mediocre. My fries were a little cooler than I would have liked.  Overall, it's not the worst place to go for lunch.
