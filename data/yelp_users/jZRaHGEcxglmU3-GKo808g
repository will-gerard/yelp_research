This was my first time going to a barber. I have also gone to corporate places and I now see why barbers are so much better. This place uses vacuums with their trimmers and they take their time on their cuts. Nick did a great job. Plus they give back massages too. I was a little intimidated going into a barber but after leaving here I was comfortable. You now have a regular customer.

Great service and even better food! This place is a hidden gem. Iv tried several different entrees and haven't been disappointed yet. The only thing that sucks are their hours. Sometimes they close pretty early. But I guess family is important to them so you can't be too upset about it. Try it, you'll like it.

Good food as well as good service. Nothing fancy but the facility is clean and inviting. Glad to have found a fast laid back Chinese place near my new house.

Been to this location many times and have always had a good experience. I was skeptical about them having 'the lowest prices' so I asked my friend who use to work for the company. He assured me they have the lowest prices and they don't offer any coupons or discounts because it is the lowest. My contractor also told me they have great prices. I recommend Floor and Decor. So many options too.

First time going to this location. Took over an hour to get appetizers. Service was terrible. An hour and 5 minutes for wings and oysters is ridiculous. Plates were dirty, silverware had dried food on it still. Wrote the corporate office and didn't get a response. Great customer service.. Not.

Excited to finally find a place in the west valley for happy hour besides West Gate, we looked on the online menu to see if it was worth checking out. And we've been to the one in old town Scottsdale so we thought it was going to be similar. Man were we wrong. Though this place has so much potential to thrive based on their location and set up, somewhere down the chain of command this place fails. The menu wasn't what was online. And when I asked for an item that was on the printed menu, they said even that menu was incorrect. So there has been 3 revisions of the menu and they still don't have an updated one. Their happy hour is not impressive at all. They just a few drinks on happy hour. The margaritas are served in small clear plastic solo cups. This caused all the salt to fall inside the drink before it was served. Not a good setup there. Though their food was good, the service was severely lacking. I wish they would get their act together as its a great location, but unless I see things change and they actually put effort to make this place good, I won't be back and I don't recommend anyone else going. I don't know how this place continues to stay in business.   These place needs to be on Bar Rescue. It's that bad.

My new build home was installed with this company's equipment. Since I have moved in, they constantly solicit their services to me. They come to my door and call me. At first I accepted their pamphlets so when I'm ready to call them I will, but they keep calling me once a week. After nicely telling them for the past 4 month I am not interested, I just got a call and very nicely and respectfully asked the guy to please not call, I will call when I'm interested. He hung up on me. This is extremely unprofessional and that move right there just turned me off to this company. It doesn't matter if their equipment is installed in my home, I will not use them. I will also be contacting my home builder to let them know of my dissatisfaction of this company.  My development is Travata, 85382.

I started going to Lenny's Barber Shop when I moved to the area and very glad I ventured in. The facility is very nice and kept up well. Top notch furnishing, service, and competitive prices. Michael has been cutting my hair and he does a great job. He remembers how I want it cut and takes his time to ensure perfection. Props to Lenny for a great job running a professional business with excellent customer service. Check them out, you won't be disappointed. Support local!

My friend and I are dancing when a bouncer said, "My manager wants to talk to you outside." We immediately knew what they were up to, but we complied and followed the bouncer outside. They were wanting to kick us out. We literally had less than 4 drinks all night and as we go to the exit the 'manager' said, 'you've had too much to drink and you have to leave.'  What? We had 4 drinks all night. We were dancing minding our own business all night in their club and got kicked out. We didn't do anything bad at all. I was teaching my friend how to country dance and we got kicked out. That's the last time I'll go into that place. I have a Groupon for their place. I'll let it expire before I go there again. We got kicked out for literally nothing. Don't go to that club, they abuse their power and will kick you out for nothing at all.

A nice club... If you ever get in. We went once on a Sunday night and had no problem getting in but we went one day on a weekend and that was another story...We were in the GA line a few minutes before they opened the doors. Since we were in line first we expected to be let in soon after they opened. This was a joke. We we waited in line for an hour and 50 minutes after they opened. Once the doors opened, they only let in groups through the exit doors. We were like ok maybe they have table/bottle service that's cool we will wait a little longer.  We continued to wait for 45 minutes. They would only let the "promoters" guests in only, or if you were a group of girls. They said they were full but let us know if they have more room. Meanwhile they were allowing girls, and other people bypass the line. It was a horrible experience. We kept asking the bouncer at the door when we will be let in and he said "soon". After waiting almost two hours we finally asked what we have to do to get in. He said because their "Guy to girl ratio is too high" which is BS because they kept letting guys in, we would have to pay $50 to get on plus a minimum of a $50 bar tab per person. This would have not been as bad IF THEY WOULD HAVE SAID THIS TWO HOURS AGO! Horrible service. Skip this place and go to somewhere where they actually care about others than the bottle/table service customers. If you don't pay $1500 for a table $250 for a bottle, then you won't be treated with dignity or respect. Go elsewhere.

I just stayed here for 5 days for the weekend of April 9th. We wanted something cheap but yet something centrally located and somewhere we won't get pregnant just from sleeping on the bed. Checked in on Thursday and out on Monday.   After booking the room I read the reviews in this place. I immediately regretted not reading the reviews first. But It was too late to cancel so I said f it and said we will try it for ourselves.   I originally booked the cheapest room, which I think was the deluxe room. When we checked in the lady was very nice and highly encouraged us to upgrade to the next room... Then she very easily persuaded us by saying the next rook up is only $10 more a night and the she told us the room I booked was remodeled about 18-20 years ago () but the next room up was only $10 extra a night and was remodeled 8-10 years ago. We were immediately sold.  She then asked if we wanted the noisy side (facing the strip) or that quiet side. Us two being there to party, we requested the noisy side. I asked if there was a refrigerator in the room. She said they are $10 extra a night but she said she will throw it I'm since we upgraded. That was very impressive.   We got to the 10th floor and found our room. Going into this with a bad taste after reading the yelp reviews I expected to be disgusted. I was pleasantly surprised by the room. It was actually decent. Nothing like staying at a fancy hotel but it got the job done.   Now we go to the bad things: All sinks drained very slow  Parking was kinda scarce The elevators smelled like weed ALL DAY EVERY DAY.  The entire building smelt like cigarette smoke.  The carpet in the hallways/rooms needed to be quarantined.   Overall, our stay was pleasant and I'd stay there again based on the value.   Give this place a chance unless you're a princess, then stay at the Palazzo. Hope this info helps.   Btw, if you like to party, go to the pool at the Flamingo.  It's 21+ and a blast!

Great food! I am really happy this location opened. Though I understand it's still their first week open, I have been three times since they opened and every time the line to order is really long and slow moving. It wouldn't be a huge problem if it was long and moved fast but it moves so slow. Granted the employees are still new and learning. I hope they figure it out so the ordering process will be faster. But overall , the food is excellent and priced well. I was sad to see so many people walk in and then walk out once they saw the slow moving ordering line.

Update: since them opening a few weeks ago, I have been here at least 7 times. I love the food however they really need to better train their staff.   First- The guy at the meat station yelling the order to the assembly line (which is unnecessary because the assembly line staff have to ask at least two more times what you ordered). Not only is the meat guy yelling unnecessary, but it also creates an uncomfortable dining experience.   Second- they are always out of product. I understand they may be out of meats because they only cook so much and they are still tying to get a gauge on the business levels, but running out of sides/ sauce seems a little like bad planning. The last 5 out of 7 times I have been there they have been out of something. That's a little frustrating.   Third- they need better training. It's a very simple operation but I feel bad management is causing the staff to fail. The staff are trying but they look very confused by the whole operation.   I don't know if this is why the other locations like Norterra didn't last, but I hope they figure something out before they go out of business too.

Great cleaner! I started coming here to get my suits dry cleaned. The older gentleman (possibly the owner) is usually the cashier. He is very friendly, polite, and professional. Their quality of cleaning is great and never had an issue with them damaging my clothes. It's good to have a cleaner so close to home that I can trust. Give them a try, you'll be satisfied.

Was at this location today to get some tile since the Glendale store was out. Silvana and Tim both helped me. They were excellent. They went above and beyond to ensure I was taken care of and satisfied. Though I wish they had a local store to store transfer program, it worked out in the end and I got my tile shipped from the Tucson store. These employees spent extra time to answer my questions and didn't make me feel like an inconvenience. Love this company and the quality of their employees.

Excellent food and great service. I have been there once since it opened and definitely plan to be back soon.   I have been back several times since my first visit and have been really happy each time. The food is excellent, service is top notch, and I really like how they offer substitutions for the lunch (drink, soup, or egg roll).
