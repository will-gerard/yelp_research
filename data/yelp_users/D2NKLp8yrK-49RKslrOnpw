This place has an interesting layout with multiple little areas to eat drink and overall be merry.  The patio is nice and I loved the little downstairs bar/cellar.  I had an array of appetizers for dinner that were all excellent.  Spicy and flavorful.  I'm really looking forward to returning!

Breakfast of filet mignon eggs benedict???  Are you kidding me? This breakfast is no joke.  Had to take half home, and it made a great dinner too.  I have never had a bad meal here, my only complaint is it's too far from my house.

Best place for lunch!  Five dollar glasses off their wonderful wine menu, plus the brushetta is off the charts, and the chicken salad is the best I've ever had!  Would eat there everyday if I lived closer.

Love ladies night!  Plus it's two nights a week not just one (Tuesdays and Fridays)!  This place is great for experienced marksman or the novice alike.  Their Range masters are happy to take the time to explain how to use your or their guns.  Great shooting tips and friendly staff.  Happy to return week after week!

Enjoyed the class I took here.  Competent and educated teachers.  My only complaint, I left my flip flops and I think someone accidentally took mine and left theirs, which were the same shoes, but a different size.  Weird.

OMG!  I want to live here!  Can they set me up a cot in the back?  Seems pricey but I bought a deal on Travelzoo and got a great deal.  They service was amazing and the spa itself was clean, comfy and quiet!

Great fresh salads and fresh new flavors for their slice of the day.  Perfect for lunch inside or outside on the nice shaded patio.  Plus I love it when you tell your server you're splitting something and they do the work for you and bring it on two plates.

What a gem!  Hidden in an industrial area of Tempe I sought out this place for some local Raw honey.  A lot of stores either carry Crockett's regular honey, or Raw honey from Canada or Vermont or somewhere, but I wanted the best of both worlds!  As soon as you walk in the ridiculous smell of sweet honey hits you in the face!  It's awesome!  Their skilled and well educated staff will lead you to the perfect honey choice for you.  They also have some other bee related products like wax and pollen.  All your local honey needs right down the street, who knew?  Plus the honey is delicious, so glad I made the trip.

I wish this place wasn't so busy!  It is always packed!  If I didn't have to worry about things like cholesterol, or trans fat, I would eat here more often.  Great hot dogs, on a real grill with real hand dipped onion rings.

Love this place!  Went for a stay-cation with the girls for a spa day and stayed the night.  I can't wait to go back!  You are in the city but feels miles away!  The spa is amazing!  Wonderful adults only pool with great refreshing food and drinks.  Then our rooms were clean and comfortable.  Dinner at Kai was nothing short of superb, and breakfast the next morning on the patio over looking the golf course and pool area was also very good.  Overall a wonderful night away.

I can't believe the other reviews I have read, it's like I went to a completely different restaurant. Lets start from the beginning, as we walked into the restaurant I was greeted by our soon to be waitress smoking a cigarette two feet from the door. Appetizing. Then after being seated and getting some pretty tasty bread I went to the salad bar.  YIKES!  Can you say e-coli?  This also brings me to the word of the night was luke-warm.  This applied to my husbands beers, to the salad bar and to the food that took an hour to be served.  Did I mention that I was served the wrong food.  And not just a little wrong but completely a different dish.  After I recieved what I actually ordered I decided to stick with the bread.  The beef was a salt lick, and the dumpling was as solid as a brick.  This place was such a disappointment.  I felt sick after leaving and needless to say I will not be back.

WOOO HOO!  Halliluja I think someone anwsered my prayers and hired all new wait staff!   I had previously stopped coming here despite the great food, the service was just SSOOO slow and crappy!  But low and behold I went to breakfast, on a Saturday morning none the less and had refills brought over before my glass was empty, got the check delivered before I had to ask, and got out of there within an hour!  A new Orange Table record.  Not to mention the expresso was delish, and the Catlan scramble was an amazing blend of salty briney olives with spicy chorizo, mixed with ripe tomato and melty manchego cheese.  Loved it.

Man, I thought that they had turned a corner when it came to service, but apparently that was a fluke.  I came in for lunch one busy Saturday, gave them my name and no preference for indoor or outdoor, was then ignored for the next 15 minutes as the five top and a three top that came in after me got seated.  The servers passing by wouldn't even make eye contact and the girl checking out customers seemed to forget why we were there.  Ended up leaving and going to AZ 88 instead.  Disappointing.

I had my rehersal dinner here for my wedding.  I had a lot of people coming in from out of town and staying at the Vally Ho so we chose this place because it was within walking distance.  I must say I was hesitant because I went with my then fiance (now husband) for dinner one night just to check it out and I was not impressed with the food.  However my very large group was so well accomodated, I couldn't have asked for more.  I would hightly recommend getting the hors d'oeurves packages that they offer.  A great price and something for everyone, they can get a plate and munch at bar tops with drinks while talking to everyone.  It was like having a bar with drinks and food just for my wedding party and family.  A truly great experience and I look forward to using this restaurant in the future for any event that requires a great atmosphere with great food and great service, for a large party.

A great place for a date night.  I don't normally appreciate it when a restaurant charges  a split plate fee, but this was actually worth the charge.  We started with the cheese plate, very good, but the server wasn't as knowledgeable as I like.  Maybe I ask too many questions, but I expect them to know not just the type of cheese, but where it's from, what kind animal the milk came from and if it's pasteurized or not.  And she did not.  Next was the lobster bisque for me and a salad for my hubby.  Both good, we shared a steak which is when we got charged the split plate fee, but the servings we each got we're larger than expected and I didn't feel irked by the up charge.

The bar chairs are surprisingly comfortable here, the bartenders are very friendly and the crowds are attractive, yet not as pretentious as some bars in Scottsdale.  I've come here for New Year's before and had a great time, plus it was not as expensive as most in this area.  I've only tried a few of the appetizers and a salad which were tasty and fresh.

What a wonderful dining experience.  After having to cut out dairy, soy, nuts, eggs and gluten from my diet because of some allergies I thought eating out would forever be painful and tasteless.  However Atlas Bistro saved the day!  The server actually took the menu and highlighted the items that were compatible with my diet.  Then once the food arrived it was delicious!  I didn't feel like I was missing out on a thing.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to those who are looking for a vegan, or lactose free, or gluten free dining experience.  Not to mention my husband has none of these restrictions and enjoyed his food just as much.

Love this place! The meatball sub is out of this world! Homemade meatballs swimming in homemade marinara sauce on a crusty baguette. Don't forget the pizza, the crust alone is so tasty, buttery and herbacious, then add all the tasty creative toppings and you've got a pizza masterpiece! I love getting fresh cannoli's for desert or a couple of Baci which mean 'kiss' and are little dark chocolate hazelnut truffles.  No matter what you choose, I'm betting it is all good!

I wish I had only eaten what I ordered! The special Thai basil with chicken, it was was awsome! Fresh veggies in a perfectly spicy sauce with lots of white meat chicken with perfectly cooked jasmine rice. Unfortunately I tried what my hubby ordered too. The pad Thai was inedible it was so sweet. Way too much sugar and the noodles were gummy and yuck. Luckily there was enough of mine to satisfy us both. We also tried the Thai iced tea and Thai iced coffee, as well as the sticky desert rice pudding with mango. Interesting texture and good flavor. I will be back and I will never eat the pad Thai again.

I do love restaurants that are in converted houses, don't ask me why.  The patio is great because in the winter they have heaters and on the weekends a guy sitting outside playing guitar and singing in Spanish, making for great ambiance.   But this is tough because I've been to this place and gotten 5 star service and meal, and then I've gone and gotten 2 star service and meals.  So I've settled for in between.   As for the menu they do have excellent, authentic mole which is hard to come by.  I personally adore the lamb dish  which is fall off the bone delicious as well as the rib-eye if you are looking for a nice protein.  If you are more in the mood for something in a tortilla their shrimp and fish tacos or seafood enchiladas are both stuffed with fresh seafood and dressed with homemade sauces.  They serve healthful sides like black beans, brown rice and fresh veggies.  To end the night I highly recommend the chocolate pie which has a toasted almond crust and creamy, chocolate mouse filling.  On a side note you can buy tamales in the winter months full of fun flavors, like chocolate and pineapple.

A great place to come watch UFC fights if you don't want to pay for the paper-view at home.  Super croweded though so get there early if you want a seat.  Good bar food, and the service has been good, even when it's standing room only.

I love this place for breakfast.  Everything I have ever ordered has been good.  I normally stick to my Eggs Benedict (I get the California style w/ avocado and tomato) and call it good.  But here I have tried the breakfast burrito, the whole wheat pancakes, the protein pancakes, the huevos rancheros, the veggie omlette, chocolate chip pancakes, and it was all good!  Yeserday I saw they have a pumpkin pancake, I think I'll wait for the holiday spirit to hit me before I try that one, but I'm sure it will be awsome.  If I had to gripe, I wish they had a bar for mimosa's and Bloody Mary's, but I should probably cut down on my morning drinking anyway.

I enjoyed the prime rib, and I thought it was reasonably priced. We sat in the bar which was noisy, but we still got good service from the waitress. The trout and cous cous was also very good. We split the banana cream pie for desert and it was so fresh with real banana's. Would definitely go back.

I got married here a few years ago and I still hear about how great it was. I agree! Five star service all the way. We were married on the roof and had champagne and hors d' oeuvres there, then the reception downstairs, in a ballroom that had break-away doors, open to the spacious patio. Outside they had a bar and comfy couches for people to lounge and talk. Inside they arranged food stations instead of a buffet or a sit down dinner. This way there were no lines and people could custom order. There was a carving station with prime rib, a seafood station with tiger shrimp and scallops, then a pasta and salad bar station as well. The best wedding food I have ever had! The wedding coordinator Melanie was so great to work with, it was the least stressful thing I booked. If I could afford it I think I would book this place again, just to have another great party that I could have time to actually enjoy!

Had to find a new lawn service after the one I was using closed up shop.  Where to look but Yelp!  Saw the good review and called up Marcy to have her come and give me an estimate.  What a great experience.  Nice, friendly, punctual!  They did a great job.  The shrubs and bushes were done as  I requested (I hate it when they trim them so short, I lose the shade over my bedroom window), they hand pulled weeds, and they even went above and beyond and cleaned up the dog poop!  The price was reasonable and they worked with me on my schedule (I work nights) and even got it all done before my company arrived the next day.  So glad I found them, with a little help from yelp, ofcourse.

These guys did about as good of a job as I could expect.  Didn't work any miracles, my carpet still has some spots that didn't come up completely so I can't give them five stars.  I was impressed with how hard Farhad worked, he really was busting his butt.  They did a good job on my rooms and couch.  Would use them again in the future.

Let me start by saying the food was great.  Having made a bit of a drive to get there we went all out and ordered a little smorgasbord of items.  A dark chocolate shake, strawberry lemonade, onion rings, a Thai chicken salad, ribs and a fontina burger.  Wow, it was a lot of food.  The salad was really the only thing I found a little lacking and that may have been because everything else was SO good.  The onion rings were hand dipped and fried in panko breadcrumbs, crispy and hot.  The ribs were fall off the bone and so lean!  The burger was melt in your mouth.   The only issue I did  have was that seating was hard to come by for us and the other couple we came with.  Their son needed a highchair, so we ended up outside.  Which seemed to be nice, even cool, (in June)  but as soon as the boys brought the food out there was a swarm of nasty flies!  They were everywhere, I literally couldn't eat without having to move my arms around my plate to keep them at bay.  We had to take the party inside.  It was croweded and difficult to get the highchair to the table.  So maybe not the greatest if you've got kids.  Otherwise, worth the trip.

Came in to watch the game after we moved and didn't have the dish hooked up yet!  Lot's of ASU fans, which is always a plus!  The patio area is great and it's open to the rest of the bar.  The only problem with this is when someone is smoking it comes right into the main dinning area.  Yuck.  The beer selection is good though and the kettle chips were awesome, could've ordered seconds.

So disappointing! Went to the tasting menu they had back around x-mas and it was bad! The chef started the meal announcing to everyone that they had changed the menu three times before preparing it for that night, believe me it showed! It just seemed so amateur and thrown together at the last minute.  Could've been so much better.  I had been in before and had some of their regular menu items, this just really assured that I will not be back.

Here's a thought, don't post on the door to your restaraunt "Up scale Mexican Food" unless you can prove it.  This was not upscale, it was barely pass-able  as decent.  Didn't help that the waitress got both of our orders wrong.  Will not return.

Took my husband for our anniversary and it was great.  I loved their little amuse bouche that kept us interested between each dish.  Plus I've never been served cotton candy for desert, what a great idea.  The deserts were the best part of the meal.  My hubby got the gelato and it was amazing.  Can't wait to return.  The only problem, we made reservations and still had to wait for a table.

I came here for breakfast after working a LONG shift at the hospital and I have to say I really was not impressed.  The drink I ordered the "Antioxidant" seemed watered down and flavorless.  The hollandaise on my Eggs Benedict seemed watered down and flavorless.  Overall the food just seemed uninspired. Maybe it was just my crummy mood after such a long night. I'll have to go back and give them another try. Just in case...

Came here for a birthday dinner and found it average. Nice decor and fun seating and bathrooms. But for the price I just wasn't blown away. It kind of annoyed me that our server when asked about something kept saying, "It's so great, it's my favorite!" Really? The whole menu is your favorite? Every wine on the wine list is your favorite? My father order a ribeye that looked like a NY strip and said something to the waiter.  He argued with him for like ten minutes.  My father worked as a butcher for many years.  Trust me if he said it wasn't a ribeye, it wasnt.  I wont be back.

As the wonderful sister and daughter I am I brought my mother and sister here for a girls spa day.  I chose this place 'cause they were offering discounted prices for the summer, big mistake!  I did not go to Yelp first to read reviews!  What was I thinking?!?  First my sister and I showed up early to take the oppertunity to enjoy the pool and possibly a drink.  We checked in at the spa thinking we would drop off our purses, change, get a tour...no such luck!  Turns out they don't have a locker room... or a tour for that matter.  I was shown the bathroom and told I could change there.  Nice, thanks.  Second once at the pool it took a half an hour for one of the three waitress to bring us a drink, even though they passed by us multiple times, without making eye contact.  Then after finally re-hydrating I found out I had to walk out of the pool area, past the restaurant, through the lobby to get to the bathroom!  No bathroom outside by the pool, or the bar?  What a joke.  Third, I showed up to my facial in my wet bathingsuit, sweaty (it's 106 outside!) covered in sunscreen and chlorine.  No shower in the treatment room.  No robe.  Gross.  Then I payed extra for a eye treatment that I was told was great.  Thirty seconds each eye.  Yes half a minute was the EXTRA I payed for.  On top of that I finnished before both my mother and my sister were done with their treatments.  Even though we all started at the SAME time!  WTF??    I don't care the discount, I will NEVER go back, you couldn't pay me.

I have had the oppertunity to work with these jewlers a couple of times, whether picking out my wedding ring or returning a pearl necklace that my parents bought me they are always five star!  The service is excellent.  I never feel pressured when trying on the same ring for the third year in a row...(still waiting on my hubby to come around on that one!) or guilty for returning something I got as a gift and just didn't like.  They returned it, no questions asked and gave me store credit on the balance. I love going to their x-mas parties which always have great food and a fun enviroment, plus you can win free stuff!

What a great place!  Came in before a wedding while the baby was sleeping...wasn't sure I'd have time to get both my nails and toes done before the dredded awakening!  They were nice enough to do both at the same time.  And when the baby woke up the girl doing my nails rushed so that I could hold him.  Since my hands were occupied she gave me a shoulder rub instead of a hand massage.  They did a great job and the service was excellent.  Glad to make it a regular spot.

I received a call from this company one day, used to be called Al's tree and yard service, and they were following up on previous customers wondering if I needed to have my trees and bushes trimmed. In fact I did, because I had contacted two other companies, arranged for estimates and then they never showed up. Chip Off the Old Block gave me a time and date they would be here and they were on time! They gave a very reasonable estimate and finished the work shortly after. Quick, clean and efficient. Will use them again.

Wow what a great experience!  So thankful that SRP referred me to these guys.  They were punctual, well spoken (in that they could explain things to me in a language I could understand), knowledgeable and reasonably priced.  They removed our old swamp cooler, repaired the duct systems and when they suspected our dryer vent wasn't connected right they fixed that too, all in one visit.  Awesome.  I will be using them for all my A/C needs from now on.

Once I found the place (tucked into a corner in a condo center, weird) I enjoyed the place.  Really caters to those trying to avoid certain foods for whatever reason, vegan, gluten free, ect, and does it incredibly well.  The menu clearly lays out which each selection has in it, whether that be eggs, gluten or whatever.  Since it was our first time we started with the air baked sweet potato fries which had cinnamon and nutmeg and was served with a sweet/spicy dipping sauce, then came the green chili chicken soup which was a little thin as far as consistency, but the flavors were good .  For the entree I had the mango, black bean salad with chicken.  It had sweet juicy mango with white meat chicken, black beans, raspberries and served with a tasty lime dressing.  It was so delicious!  To top it off I ended with a vegan/gluten free brownie, I have no idea they got the flavor and texture so right without all the ingredients I would normally associate with a brownie.  Truly a mystery.  Can't wait to return.  Like some previous yelpers, I did have a slight problem with the seemingly dis-interested wait staff.  Had to ask for refills repeatedly.

Tried a couple of their frozen coctails one night, not good.  To be fair after trying the first one and gagging it back into the glass I asked the bartender to make it again with less sugar, he did, and it was still bad.  I don't think it was the sugar that was the problem.  If I'm there again I think I'll stick to beer.

Had a heck of a time finding a box that has flexible schedules, great coaches and get this CHILDCARE!  And not the, "heres a room to lock your kid in while you workout" childcare, but the OMG this is like my son staying with grandma for an hour childcare.  The community here truly wants you to succeed, not just by being able to lift heavy things, but also eat better, feel better and include your family and friends while doing it.  Thats right, I said community, because its not just a box!

Went for this place with a fellow yelper who had good things to say.  I agree, good burger!  The bread was soft, the bacon crispy and the fries hot!  Burger was cooked just right and I liked the way the menu was set up so you could build your own.  Looking forward to going back.

Apparently my babysitter doesn't return my text anymore...so I had to find an alternative!  This is a great place if you need somewhere in a pinch, or if 4 hrs is all your need for a sitter.  My son is always eager to go back so they must be doing something right.

Mike was such a great teacher and presenter! It is not easy keeping the attention of 15, 5 year olds but he did, and they even learned something! I was so impressed and the kids were inthralled. All the reptiles seemed well taken care of and seemed used to being pet by little hands! Best birthday ever!

So excited this place is open!  Being picky about the food you eat can sometimes leave you limited on options.  But not anymore!  Organic, fresh and grass fed meats, yum!  They make all their dressings from scratch and the serving sizes were huge!  The staff was SO friendly and open.  They are talking about expanding the menu to include breakfast too, can't wait!
