Yay: The outdoor bar is cute, although 105 degrees and humid prohibits actually *sitting* outside and enjoying a drink.  Yay: Despite the uber-bitchy hostess, we were actually able to get seated on a Friday night at 8 pm right away, although there were inklings of staff resistance.  Yay: Very cute decor.  Boo: It's eight hundred degrees outside, and you know what? When you're a cheap ass with the AC, it's eight hundred degrees INSIDE too.  Boo: The thai spring rolls are like nothing I've ever had, and not in a good way. Kind of cold and flaccid, yet sticky, and filled with little white noodles. Huh? No. Even if it tasted good, it's too close to fellating a cadaver for my taste.  Boo: NO substitutions. NO sauce on the side. Especially -- according to the wide eyed server -- because the owner was there that night. I do not give a rat's ass. I am the customer. If I want a side of sauce, who the hell cares? Pretentious jackass.  Boo/Yay: I am picky about curry. I like it very very very thick, which Fate's was. However, it was actually quite flavorless, a surprise given that the empty takeout container stunk my kitchen up so bad you'd think it would have flavor for days. The tofu was good, though, crispy and not gooey.  Boo: Service? Sucked out loud, especially after we got our entrees. Literally abandoned, we had to get up and actually get a server, any server, so we could get takeaway boxes and the check. The same server never came by twice.  So, you have mediocre food and a staff with the deadly combination of clueless and pretentious. No thank you. I know everyone seems to love Fate, and I wanted to too, but we will not be back.

A car wash is a car wash is a car wash. No matter how much you pay for it, there's usually still some goopy tar or a speck of dried up bird shit stuck on your car and water spots where it didn't get dried well.  It always costs a little more than it should, and takes too much damn time out of a precious Saturday morning.  So why bother to go to Los Olivos? It's an independent small business in a sea of Danny's-type mega-places. They actually do a decent job, and while it's certainly no screaming bargain, it's reasonable. They have a buy-10-get-1-free punch card deal, which would be cool if I didn't keep losing the cards. Oh, and they love the gays, just like I do.  Now if they would only re-open their little coffee stand...

No matter your persuasion, there are good times to be had here.  The people watching is spectacular and everyone is super friendly... just watch out for the 70+ year old (!) tranny who looks just amazing, because she will drag your unwilling ass onto the dance floor to teach you to two-step!

Despite my penchant for $1000 handbags, I am a cheap bastard.  I endure the chaos, misery, and dregs of humanity snarfing samples like pigs at the trough that populate Costco for cheap gas, paper towels, toilet paper, Kirkland ibuprofen, toothpaste, and tequila, and more. The thought of wasting cash by paying retail on stupid shit like Ziploc baggies is horrifying.  This particular location is a little ghetto, but not as much so as the one at Christown (my choice of absolute last resort). I recently got new tires here -- you order them online, and then the tires get shipped to the location you want, and then you just show up and they install them at no extra charge. Now, the bummer was that they don't take appointments for this, but if you plan accordingly you can just walk down to Target, and/or slowly consume a delicious strawberry frozen yogurt sundae from the Costco snack bar outside with a good book.  And their house pizza at the snack bar? Killer. There was a stupid Chuck-e-cheese type place back in Chicago my parents used to take me to when I was a kid, and I swear this pizza is identical, so maybe my fondness for it is rooted in nostalgia. I don't care. It is scrumptious.

So, a meal at the Macayo's in north Scottsdale, for whatever reason, always was a one-way ticket to Diarrheaville in my experience. Maybe the employees were angry and washing their dirty hands in the salsa buckets. Don't know, don't care.  The Macayo's on Central (of ugly Mayan-themed building and President-dining fame) is different. This is the Denny's of Mexican food - always good, always middle America, lots of screaming kids, lame attempts at kitsch. I find that takeout is a much safer way to indulge in the artery-hardening goodness Macayo's has to offer.  There are many, many much enjoyed references to dear God, as well as the Mother Mary and her revered child on Yelp. Well, if the sweet baby Jesus was ever to ejaculate, it might taste like Macayo's Baja sauce, and I mean that in the most flattering manner, i.e., SBJ might also spout forth with Cinnabon frosting. Baja sauce is this cream-cheese based, vaguely sweet, vaguely spicy green chili-tinted fatty goopy sauce that can be ladled on virtually any plain Jane item... thus turning water into wine, or some business like that. The green corn tamale slathered in Baja sauce is a most guilty pleasure that always leaves me feeling fulfilled, but slightly unsettled and a tick guilty mixed with a dash of naughty. It's the one-night stand of condiments, no doubt.  So on nights like these, where my weekend's diet has already been ravaged by Harlow's, Delux, and the pseudo-red velvet cupcakes I made at home (chocolate cake mix + red food coloring), I just gotta say WTF -- Macayo's takeout it is.

Even though the weekend morning pandemonium at the coffee bar/bakery area practically gives me hives, I keep coming back... again and again. The plain old school straight up coffee is surprisingly mellow and palatable. The baked goods are downright irresistible. The cinnamon muffins and scones are out of this world, and I'm clearly not the only one who feels that way since they were already out of both last few times I was in. You greedy bastards!   The flowers are gorgeous, unique, and high-quality. The beer selection is excellent and I love that you can buy singles (although I worry that Total Wine is going to have them beat in no time, both in selection and price). The soup and salad bar are predictably satisfying, and their cheese selection is fab. Oh, and they have my beloved Fage Greek yogurt -- the only vendor in central Phoenix, that I am aware of.   Only minus one teensy tiny bit of a star because it's pricey; but do remember, you get what you pay for. The remainder of that star comes off because the patrons are completely insufferable. I practically have to elbow bitches out of the way to get my number at the bakery. This ain't Last Chance, you crazy hos! Calm down, we will all be caffeinated in turn. Sheesh!

The Eggery is the exact same franchise as the Good Egg down at Park Central, just fussied up with a different name. Exact. Same. Menu. Bleh. Had I known, I would have just taken a stroll through the gayborhood to get to the Good Egg, where there is outdoor seating, the people watching is superior, and the pigeons have balls the size of grape tomatoes.  Alas, the Eggery is the Good Egg's fat, dorky older sister. The service is completely adequate -- nothing horrific, nothing staggering. The food is average, but somehow always arrives cold. At our last visit, there was a metric shit ton of people waiting (including a sweet aging tranny in a muumuu, chartreuse ankle socks, and chunky black heels) but the restaurant proper was only half full, if that. Why?   Needless to say, I won't be back. There's too many other amazing breakfast places in Phoenix and way too few precious available weekend mornings...

I hate this fucking stinky ghetto shithole. My car was broken into here in broad daylight. There's always unsavory characters lolling about, and that's just the people that work there. They roll one distrustful eye up towards you (the other obscured by emo fringe) and glare at you for even daring to disturb them. As for the people that shop here, if you stand too close, you will probably catch lice and get exposed to tuberculosis in one shot. Every time I come here, without fail, there is some sorry sack of shit at the pharmacist counter, trying to convince them they just "lost" their written prescription for Vicodin, or their Percocets got "stolen", all with Emmy-award winning shows of anguish and pain. So you're asking now why I even come here, and I don't blame you. I work long hours, and this is the closest 24-hour pharmacy to my humble abode. Sometimes, a girl doesn't have time to  drive to a first-world facility. What can I do, except clutch my bag extra close, scared-old-lady style, and take an extra long shower with extra disinfecting soap when I get home.

Standard American-ized Chinese food. Will sub tofu for any meat of any dish. Huge, HUGE menu. Super fast service. EXTREMELY strong cocktails. My father and SO both openly love it.  Sold.

Even though I can feel all the gay boys trying to figure me out when I come here, it's my go-to place for fabulous greeting cards, dry and sarcastic, with lots of emphasis on alcoholism and dysfunctional families. Perfect for me and mine.

Oregano's, you are vile, and I am baffled by your crowds of followers who seem willing to loiter about in 115 degree heat for over an hour for you. Everything tastes as if someone had an accident with the salt shaker in the kitchen. Bland, boring, and dehydrating. No thanks.

I have known about this place for years, but just went for the first time last week as a default when we discovered that the Big Fat whatchamacallit place across the street had closed. What a nice surprise. The staff was very friendly although they hovered a bit too much for my liking. The food was spectacular, and as a vegetarian I had a lot to choose from (although the menu needs some help; things marked with an asterisk are supposed to be vegetarian, but there were asterisks dotted all over fish dishes). The array of desserts was to die for. My main complaint? Pricey like woah. And it was sneaky pricey. There were three of us; our main dishes were $10-$12 each, with a $9 appetizer, 3 desserts, cocktails, etc. and the bill was over $160!!! I thought my poor boyfriend was going to crap himself.  I honestly don't know how it got that expensive. The drinks? The desserts? Were the baskets of pita $8 apiece? I mean, a Greek meal costing  more than a steak extravaganza at Cork and Cleaver? Come on. While all three of us just loved it (a rarity, as we are all differently picky), at that price, it's going to have to be reserved for special occasions. Sheesh!

It's a Vietnamese nail shop. It's not fancy. It's not particularly clean. The staff isn't particularly friendly, nor is the service anything amazing. Average, average, average -- and when there's an identical shop on every corner, average isn't good enough. I think I'll stick to the three shops on my regular rotation...

Poo poo on all the naysayers.   Rokerij is bad ass, which is why it is always wicked crowded. The ambiance is a teeny bit cowboy, some rustic Flagstaff, some Old-world European, and ALL sexy - grotto staircase leading to dim and plush with roaring fireplaces scattered about. The menu is diverse - plenty of funk and weirdness for the more adventuresome, but some more traditional favorites for your conservative friends. All I care about is that they still make me my beloved veggie quesadillas, bursting with roasted broccolini and corn and filled with just the right amount of cheese, served on a wooden cutting board with two kinds of fresh, flavorful, and just-enough-spicy salsa. It's so good, it keeps me from trying the small plates, which sound scrumptious.  I'm not sure where all the bitching and moaning about the service come from. Our last visit here was on a packed and swinging Saturday night where we had to wait an hour for a table. Our server was prompt, attentive, and competent, although some odd comments ("What a good looking table! Are you brother and sister?") left us scratching our heads.   The crowd is entertaining as well, although I don't think you'd find me scrounging around for a date. Lots of cougars and cougars-in-training with flashy jewelry and spray on tans. Despite this potentially stiff crowd, the place was lively and everyone seemed to be having a perfectly good time. The crowd may overlap somewhat with the 40th St/Campbell BMW- and Range Rover-driving MILF yuppie sect, but somehow it all seems a lot less pretentious here.   The word is that the neighboring DQ is going to be torn down to make room for the rebirthed Richardson's. Woo! Between Rokerij and Richardson's, this corner is going to rival 40th St & Campbell. I can't wait!

I totally forgot about Merc until the other night when my companion and I required additional alcoholic beverages after the bottle of wine we'd inhaled at True Foods. Quite an improvement since the days when we'd run across Camelback in heels, hoping a Beemer-driving drunk wasn't careening down the road at that exact time. The tunnel makes your transition into the dark sultriness of the Merc Bar that much easier.  OK, admittedly, I forgot how sexy it is. I suppose in my more actively drinking days we'd end up here on the weekends, when it was SRO and the music rendered all conversation impossible. On weeknights, it's a different scene. Quiet, but not awkwardly so. Our server? Super hot, wearing an extremely short dress, doing lots of bending over and squatting at inopportune times, thus sending my companion into a bit of a frenzy. In addition to being hot, she was actually nice. A rarity, no?   I know the drinks are expensive. What is the special ingredient they add behind the bar? Roofies? All I know is, I went in very mildly buzzed and left shitfaced. No, I'm not complaining.  Rad. It's going back on my weeknight rotation.

Look, I realize it's not cool to admit you like CPK. I'm OK with that, because they have one of the most crave-worthy salads ever: the tricolore salad, composed of spring mix and arugula with a light vinaigrette, huge pieces of shaved Parmesan, and chunks of tomato, all served on a warm Parmesan-encrusted pizza crust. I think the whole thing really defeats the purpose of a salad, but the hell with it. Finish off the gluttony with their flourless chocolate cake, served warm with vanilla bean goo on top. OMG heaven.

Tired of my vanilla stylist, I went here. I can't tell you who cut my hair, because he never introduced himself. I am (WAS) growing my hair out from a Victoria Beckham-ish short bob, and had some grown out mullety action that needed a little shaping up and pruning into something a little funky. THAT'S IT. I'm pretty sure I didn't leave that detail out when I was talking to Mystery Stylist before the cut. Oh yeah, and I expressly said NO MULLETS. You all may think they are cute and fun but I am too old for that shit even if I thought it was cute and fun.  How I ended up back to SQUARE FUCKING ONE with a super short cut with a FUCKING MULLET in the back is beyond me. Hello? Was it opposite day, and I missed the memo? This cut is a frightening blend of Kate Gosselin (that scary bitch with the thousand kids who's been on the cover of every tabloid for reasons I simply cannot comprehend) and grown-out skinbird. I have SUPER CURLY hair, and it's too short in the back to round brush and I can barely get a flat iron on it without burning myself.   I guess Mystery Stylist was too busy trying to hard-sell me a shitload of products I'd never heard of before to actually LISTEN to what I had asked for. I wanted to like you, I wanted to like the salon, I wanted to like the service. I even waited for a good deal of time after the actual cut to write this. I still hate it and I am still furious. I have not been this traumatized over a stupid haircut since junior high school. Thank you so much.

As a vegetarian and sporadic health nut, I just love TJ's. They have a nice array of inexpensive fresh produce, including my beloved broccolini, for 40% of what Safeway charges. Huge selection of frozen veggie-friendly dinners, good for my on-the-go household. Greek yogurt, cheap. Nice beer selection with lots of cheapo wine. I try to buy all my supplements here too, as they seem to be a lot less expensive. Yes, I'm all about saving cash on groceries and whatnot.  The downside? It's not one-stop-shopping; a trip always requires supplementation with another trip to a "regular" grocery store. This particular TJ's is teeny-tiny-small, and always chock-full of obnoxious and/or oblivious people who wield carts like weapons. My favorite is the woman who thinks it's an awesome time to teach little Jimmy how to push his own wee cart and comparison shop, and lets the little bastard cruise all over the store willy-nilly. I'm all for giving your kid responsibility, but a) you still have to, you know, keep an eye on the kid and b) a super-crowded claustrophobic nightmare like this place after work is not, repeat, NOT the time to do so.

OK... it's a chain. It's also one of the very few places where my dad, boyfriend, and I can go and everyone can get a meal that they genuinely like. It's a little pricey and their dessert menu leaves a lot to be desired, but their frigging veggie burger is the most delicious one in the Valley. BAR NONE. Yes, it falls apart. I don't care. I slather a bunch of BBQ sauce on it and oh my god..... and the crispy little shoestring fries on the side are perfection. I will have horrible heartburn after every time but that's because I eat, like, three times more than I usually do just because it is so so delicious.   My main tip is to park across the way in the Biltmore parking lot and walk through the tunnel, because the parking garage attached to that complex with Houston's is a total clusterfuck.

You'd think with its proximity to the chi-chi yuppieville that is Arcadia, this Target would be... well... not so ghetto. This one is actually worse than the one at Christown (oh, excuse me, "Spectrum") Mall, and that's saying something. We'll be saving this location for emergencies only.

I love our little neighborhood corner. AJ's, Wally's, Healy Bea, and little hidden gems like Taylor's. My only mistake is not trying Taylor's sooner -- not surprising, though, given the overabundance of breakfast choices in Arcadia.  We've been in three or four times now and each time has been excellent. Most notably awesome is the service: prompt, attentive, gracious, accommodating. My SO and I are used to picking off the same plate or awkwardly dumping half the meal onto another plate when we ask to share something. Not here -- our shares came out pre-split. Very nice touch.  The menu is ginormous and slightly overwhelming... even for a mushroom-phobic vegetarian. Everything I've had has been quite good - a solid 4/5. Servings are super sized (hence our sharing). Minus a wee part of a star because the coffee is very Starbucks-esque: dark, burnt, and puts hair on your chest. I just like my coffee like I like my men: pale, sweet, and weak. Heh. Minus another shred of a star for being a little pricey, and lastly, minus a tiny fraction of a star for the annoying car alarm that kept going off in the parking lot. EVERY. TIME. WE'RE. THERE. Same one.

RIP Taylor's! Somehow our friendly neighborhood breakfast spot morphed overnight into "The Daily Bistro". Gone is the impeccable service, unassuming but expansive menu, and outstanding food. Now we have a truncated, trendified menu, spotty service, and incorrectly cooked food. What used to be a beautiful relaxing patio is now tainted with unnecessarily loud techno dance music.   W. T. F.!!! No bueno. We are sad.

This place can salvage a couple of stars from me because there are a couple of booths here with spiffy shit -- unusual, quirky, one-of-a-kind type stuff.   The major turnoff at this place was the godawful exorbitant prices. Like, I think I actually laughed out loud once after flipping over a price tag. That, and the confusing, choppy layout, along with the unsmiling staff who kept giving me the side eye as if I was going to stuff an item in my purse. Just UGH.  No thanks.

You'll see more Hermes bags, flashy Rolexes, and giant glittering diamonds here on a Saturday afternoon than you may see in an entire weekend at the Chateau Marmont. Don't let the flashing jewels fool you: this place is just another run-of-the-mill Vietnamese salon, with young girls gossiping away in another language, lone hovering overseeing male figure (i.e., "the pimp"), dirty instruments, and all.   I came in with moderately grown out nails and one broken short nail, and wanted them all cut down to match the stumpy one. The answer I got? "Long nail pretty." No, really, I want them shorter. "Long nail pretty!" and so I got 9 long, ghetto-square nails and one short rounded nail. Shock of shocks, two of the long square ones chipped within 24 hours.   Even though this salon offers an array of 2-week gel polishes (Gelish and CNS Shellac), I doubt I'll be back. What's the point of paying $12+tip for a mani if you have to redo it yourself the following night?

No, we just stopped serving breakfast. The only vegetarian lunch item is the cold veggie sandwich. We're out of wheat bread. I *guess* we could toast the bread. All delivered in a forced-friendly-but-really-irritated manner by an extremely bored woman. OK, at $18 for lunch for two (1 full sandwich of the day, 1/2 veggie sandwich, two pops) I would hope that you are fully stocked, friendly, accommodating and apologetic, and don't intentionally assault my eardrums with shitty country music while I have to wait forever for very simple food.  The food was OK, but our conclusion was that something like Subway would have been faster, better, and less snotty at half the price.

Two callused and dirt-stained thumbs up! We had two separate orders of large river rock delivered to our abode, which involved elaborate maneuvering and backing up of trucks through a small gate. The truck drivers were great about it. The rock is exactly what we needed, and the price reasonable (although delivery costs more than the product, natch). My only complaint is that they were late delivering because of truck issues, but no one bothered to call us and let us know. Not the end of the world, but still. I would not hesitate to order rock from them again!

Hmmm.... shouldn't we be able to review the sales and service departments separately? Because they're kinda like night and day? Huh?  When I was in the market for a Rover, I naturally ended up here a couple of times sniffing around their pre-owned inventory. The salesman (whose name escapes me) spent a good chunk of time with us, but I really think he just wanted to play on the totally cool and bad ass off road course in the back, which takes the vehicle to completely nauseating angles and inclines. My SO had a big hard on from the experience, but the show was kind of unnecessary given that the only off-roading this girl is gonna do is going to involve curbs, bad traffic, and road rage.   After we diddled around for a few minutes on the street in the pre-owned vehicle I liked, I got a brief hard sell for a new one. Not surprising, but annoying nonetheless. I told them thanks, I'd think about it, blah blah blah. I really liked the one I drove although I wanted  to spend more time on the street with one. This is where the salespeople became MIA. Totally unhelpful. Completely worthless. And actually kind of snippy when pressed. So, screw them. I bought the exact used Rover I wanted from another dealership, fairly painlessly.  The tide turned when I brought my new Rover up there for service. The service staff are amazingly helpful and kind, and the service I have received there has been excellent, from a routine check up/maintenance to buffing to remove some surface scratches. The fees aren't astronomical; in fact, the buffing was over $100 less than other places. Even though it may cost a little more, I will definitely bring my Rover back here for the most routine of tasks, oil changes and all. I'm a convert. I'll just stay away from the sales side!

I don't know why, but the Mesa location is better than the Tempe one, and not just in that it actually seats more than fifteen people. The food is just better there (although Tempe is still tasty). The subs are killer, the selection of chips is excellent, and their goddamn Rice Krispie treats made with Fruity Pebbles are like crack cocaine (fuck the weed!). You just can't go there when you're in a hurry, as the employees don't exactly move with purpose... but are you surprised, really?

Oh, hell YES!   I am somewhat embarrassed to admit I have lived in the Valley since 1995, yet just today was my maiden voyage to the hidden gem known as Chizona's. As a Chicago girl through-and-through, I go through various stages of withdrawl for the culinary delights native to the city, including but not limited to pizza puffs and green and pink cookies shaped like leaves and dipped in chocolate, sold only at Jewel. (Although, apparently, not anymore, after I dashed in and out of no less than six Jewels looking for them during my most recent pilgrimage, eyes rolling back in my head from the tragedy of it all.)  So, yeah. Chizona's. Total hole in the wall... but you're not coming here for the ambiance. The "side" salad/"one" slice and pop combo, clocking in at a staggering $6, gives you a ginormous fresh salad with crisp Romaine lettuce, chunks of tomato, black olives, and a handful of shredded mozzarella, served in a Styrofoam bowl, natch. It's practically big enough to be a meal on its own... but then you face the "slice" of pizza, which is really a quarter of a huge pizza, cut perfectly into the beloved squares. Gooey and greasy, with a thin crust that grows delightfully cracker-y towards the edges... we are talking down-home, for real Chicago goodness. The pizza puff (which I had to sample for austerity's sake) is a delectable deep-fried gooey handful of cheesy and perfectly seasoned sausage-y joy. Oh, heaven.  The various hot sandwiches -- Italian beef, etc. -- are served on the Holy Grail of Chicagoland bread, Gonella bread, and they are humongous. The fries on the side are so-so, but you can bet your sweet ass I'm not wasting precious gastric space on fries when there's pizza perfection to be had.  Oh delicious and heavenly joyousness. Next time you're too busted to spring for a Southwest ticket to Midway and are feeling the sting of homesickness... just pop in here. These creature comforts will dull the pain... temporarily, at least. Now, if they would only sell the pink and green leaf cookies!

Ah, the go-to place for day drinking and ditching classes with my classmates in medical school. Future doctors of America, right here, baby! The menu offers standard Americanized Mexican food fare, but there's just enough variety to have something for everyone. On the days I thought it inappropriate to return to class smelling of beer, I would turn to the horchata -- fresh and delicious, every time. Like fricking clockwork. The food is fresh and, magically, not heavy. The salsa bar lets you dump on as much diarrheaogenic hot sauce as your asshole can tolerate, and the chips must be made fresh because nothing that good comes out of a bag.  Regretfully, I am virtually never in the northwest valley anymore, and have enjoyed the Caramba experience maybe once since graduation. This is tragic. Why can't Caramba force Mi Patio out and set up shop there?

For someone who has mixed feelings about zoos in general, I have to say that WWZ was pretty damn cool. I've lived in Phoenix since '95 and I just went for the first time. What is that nonsense! It's like a hidden gem that no one talks about.   Admittedly, the parking lot and area where you pay to get in are a little ghetto, but it gets so much better so quickly! The variety of critters is amazing and, for the most part, they do appear to have enough room and comfortable quarters (although I worry about them in the summer heat). The exhibits are such that you can get literally within touching distance to most of the animals, and in turn the animals are pretty mellow -- hanging out nice and close, not frightened of their admirers. So cool to see some of these gorgeous creatures so close!   The aquariums are pretty cool too, although in general things without fur or feathers freak me out. Lots of hands-on exhibits, where you can touch stingrays, starfish, crabs, and the like if you are so inclined (I was so not).   I'm a sucker for the petting zoo, where I thoroughly enjoyed being raped by twelve goats and two deer. Those bastards are aggressive and had no qualms about gnawing on my fingers, jacket, and rings when my little goat kibbles were all gone. Oh, but they're so cute. I wanted to take one of the twee little pygmy goats and stick it in my bag.   Feeding the giraffes was another highlight. It's just so much better to be able to get up so close and personal to the creatures.  The best part is that it wasn't very crowded, although the inclement weather probably helped with that. I hate battling all the overexcited bratty children at places like this, but really, it was mellow. The admission cost is about what I expected ($27 ish?), and same goes for the cost and quality of the food. The food is cash only, be 'ware!

I just freaking love this place, although I was skeptical! It's sparkling clean, never too crowded, it's cheap, huge locker room, the employees and patrons alike are amazingly polite, and the people watching is good.  The treadmills have TVs and iPod hookups. Nothing makes an hour go by faster than two back to back reruns of the Rachel Zoe show. Yes, for real.  Minus one half star for their shitty parking lot and the assholes who stalk you and maneuver to get the closest spot (hi, you're about to go inside to EXERCISE...? Would it kill you to walk fifteen feet more?), and minus one half star for the creepy Bible references sprinkled about.

OK, I've lived in downtown Phoenix walking distance from Sage for over four years now, and I'm embarrassed I've never been. There's always intriguing looking junk in front of the shop but I never stopped. Well, today was the day. I think my girl boner was at half-mast even before I got through the front door -- antique laundry baskets on rollers admixed with Buddha statues and old industrial storage baskets. Mind you, my taste in home decor is very odd -- I love industrial stuff but there is a good chunk of goth in there too, along with a smidge of high end snobbery competing with dirty hippie. It's real complicated, and as a result I have a hard time finding stores that really thrill me. Passport Imports on Indian School has some good shit, and sometimes stores for the masses like Cost Plus have some potential.  Sage simply just blew my mind. I about weed down my leg when I got inside and saw that a good 80% of the stuff is EXACTLY what I have in mind for my (future) house. Those people have my number. Old mausoleum markers in French from the 1800s -- squee!!! Oodles of beat up metal lockers -- squee!!! Old machine parts as votive candle holders -- squee!!! Humongous mirrors, framed in old ceiling tin -- squee!!! The caveat, of course, is that it's not exactly cheap.   There is a smattering of jewelry, which to be honest, doesn't match the rest of the store in terms of originality and flair. I saw some cute pieces, but nothing too different than what I already make, and certainly nothing I even wanted to see out of the case.   The owner is a little chatty, which generally turns me off, but I was so blown away and covered in my own drool I didn't even care.   This store has great potential. Personally, if it were my store, I would add a small selection of imported French toiletries and goodies like drawer sachets and dishwashing soap. People who are into the existing wares would happily pay $10 for a spiffy French lip balm they can't get here. I assure you. I am one of them. They've already got the jewelry and small knick-knacks in addition to the furniture -- it's foolish not to further expand.  I added my information to the email list to get notified of the next shipment, and I guarantee you I will be one of those fools lined up around the block as if they were giving the shit away. Mark my words.

I feel like I shouldn't even divulge this information, but they had one of their killer sales a couple weekends ago.... everything 40-50% off!!! I finally got the bank of old-school lockers I always dreamed of to use as a bookcase for my front room. My boyfriend was pissed because it was so freaking heavy, but it looks badass!!! LOVE!!!!

I'm a vegetarian, but even I still can't decide when I come to Lo-Lo's.  The food is just a big juicy heart attack waiting to happen, but by God, if you're gonna go, go out in style.  Love!

I wanted to like it.... but after $20 for two sundaes and a rip-roaring case of heartburn, I'll pass. Gah!

I wish I loved Mi Patio.  I could walk here from my house. It's cheap and has a big menu. The margaritas are yummy and cost the same as pop. It's cute, inside and out.  But the food...? It's just.... so.... blah. And there's so much amazing Mexican food in the area, why in God's name would you settle for blah?  Every time my SO and I go by it, we look at each other, shrug, and say, "I wish we liked that place!"  Maybe we'll give it another try sometime soon....

When I used to work across the street at St. Joe's, Pino's was the ultimate bad-day comfort food. Their Greek salad is humongous and amazing, with bursts of flavor from kalamata olives and feta. It's yummy with shredded pizza mozzarella on top too! The bread on the side is fresh and tasty. When I feel like a complete glutton, I go for the calzone, but be warned - it's about three meals' worth of food! The service is always good and everyone is super friendly. I'm not a huge fan of the pizza itself, but not because it's *bad", but because NY style isn't my bag. There's plenty of pasta and sandwiches available though, in addition to calzones and salads - so any discerning palate should be pleased! Oh, yeah - beer and wine only, and the hours can be a little sporadic.

With so many great shops in AZ, it's hard to pick one as "the best".  Immaculate, however, is seriously in the running for the top spot.  Aaron Coleman is one gifted motherfucker.  His work is instantly recognizable from afar, full of bold shapes and bursts of color. Aaron's charmingly demented mind can lead to some cray-cray shiz if you let him off his leash, but he also respects the less uninhibited souls such as myself. His Orienlal and old school work is flawless.   Plus - huge PLUS - everyone there is super nice and friendly. Including Aaron, whose degree of talent could let him get away with being a total diva asshole if he wanted to. Rest assured, he is the opposite.   Prices are perfectly reasonable and on par with comparable shops in the Valley.   There is usually a hairy wait list, involving booking months in advance with a cash deposit.  As others have said, this isn't all bad, as it gives you time to refine your idea and save up the cash. (and by cash, I mean it literally - no credit card machines here)

Timo does great work -- and, a major plus, he's actually nice!  Nothing is more offensive to me than my-shit-don't-stink tattoo shop staff and artists (ahem, no names).  Everyone here is very friendly and the artwork is gorgeous...

Okay. I get not all "antique" stores are going to be full of gems. i get that they often lean towards the thrift shop end of the scale. And you know what? I'm okay with that, especially when the prices are good. Here, I picked up a good-size glass jar, full of old matchbooks, and had myself a good LOL at the $45 price tag. The fact that the jar was hermetically sealed with clear tape (lest any hooligan snag a matchbook or two) should have been a heads up.   A truly disproportionate number of booths were full of crafty Michael's castoffs, including but not limited to cheap beading supplies and down-home faux-aged hand painted signs bearing cheesy phrases. Maybe this just reflects the location, as Chandler is a quasi-suburban post-apocalyptic wasteland. Last I checked, Chandler boasts both Michael's AND Hobby Lobby, so one would think the market is saturated.  Alas, perhaps I am spoiled by the richness of antique/junk store shopping "in the city", but I really fail to see how this qualifies as an antique store. There are way too many other wonderful spots in the Phoenix area, don't waste your time here.

This whole "concept" store layout needs to be just that... a concept somebody considered briefly while hungover, and then appropriately discarded. I've been here enough times now to know that the store is incredibly cramped, difficult to navigate, and at times downright claustrophobic. The kicker was yesterday, when I was trying to get through the twee little rooms without knocking any displays over with either my purse (not huge) or my shopping bags (not excessive in number or size). Impossible! I just wanted to get the F out of there, especially when some toddler started wheeling his own stroller around in a tight area, while his oblivious mother (using that term loosely, mind you) shopped one room over. Um, no thanks. And you know what the kicker is? I almost feel as is their selection got *smaller*. How is that possible?

After passing my boards (woot!) it was time to find a little reward for myself after years of agony and sacrifice. Nothing serves this purpose better than big honking diamond stud earrings. I scoured the Internet, not knowing diddly-squat about diamonds. I wasn't stoked about spending that kind of cash, sight unseen, so buying off the net was out of the question. So I headed off to the Mecca for those who worship at the altar of Consumption: Fashion Square.   Macy's? I was ignored, and then finally unenthusiastically "helped" by someone who barely spoke English. Kay's, being its bad ghetto self, didn't have any earrings large enough. Cartier... well, now, they were above and beyond stunning, but cost as much as the annual GDP of some small African countries. Plus, they had these weird spring loaded safety backs, which I could just imagine slipping out of my greasy little fingers and shooting down the drain, only to be replaced at a cost of $300 each or something. No. My rings are Cartier, but for earrings? No. Tiffany's was closed. Evidently people who have JOBS and can only get to the mall in the evening don't get to shop there.   I stumbled into Ben Bridge, fatigued and confused. There I met Matt, a young, only slightly user-car-salesmanish sales associate, who was very friendly and helpful, and never once treated me like I was stupid (which I am) or poor (which I am not). He absolutely bent over backwards to find the best set of stones at the best value, which ended up falling right in the middle of my price range. Because everything I do is high-maintenance and difficult, I needed to have the earrings within a day and a half for this fancy dinner, and one of the stones needed to be ordered, and then both set. Matt really went above and beyond, even offering to drop them off at my work so I would have them in time. He was at once friendly and professional, without fail, and the earrings are gorgeous, exactly what I wanted.  Thank you!  P.S. The stones are certified, and you can trade them in with BB should you decide you want something different in the future. Can't beat that!

Ben Bridge may not have the name recognition of Tiffany's or the designer panache of Cartier, but this jewelry store is top notch in my book. Matt, the fella who sold me my diamond studs a couple years ago, also helped me with my first big-girl watch recently. In the grand scheme of Rolex buyers, I am hardly a high roller -- no gold, no diamonds, no flashy flash bling bling a ling for me. Matt still treated me as if I was spending $20k on a watch, both during the sale and after -- he still remembers both my and my SO's names and treats us like their best customers.  BB will also clean and polish jewelry at no charge -- and they do a BETTER job on my Cartier pieces than Cartier does. And they are friendlier. Matt also helped me with a necklace that I hadn't bought there -- he identified the material, the stones, and cleaned it up lickety split. Where else are you going to get this kind of service? It's a rarity in this day and age, but it's made me a customer for life.

The economy is in the shitter and I KNOW NM is suffering. You would think that upper management would have spread the word that now is the time to be friendly to customers. I realize this is a foreign concept. I'm not a high roller or anything, but I do spend serious cash when provoked. I bought my first Balenciaga bag a couple years ago, and did get a nice thank-you card from the SA; however, when the tassels started to split six months later, I inquired about replacements. Crickets. No follow up. That is sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.   When I bought another Balenciaga, the guy working barely stopped checking out all the passersby long enough to ring me up. Barely a thank-you. No note. And this was just a few months ago, when we all knew for real what kind of economic shit the economy was in. Sloppy.  The straw was broken this past weekend, when I stopped by to redeem a frequent shopper gift card. The snotty blonde cow working at the Chanel counter looked outwardly irritated by my purchases. She made sure to make handwritten notes all over my receipt and the NM stickers on the products themselves that they were purchased with said gift card. What, so I don't sneak back and try to return a half-used $30 mascara? Seriously?   Now that bad-ass Barney's is in town, NM has got some serious competition. You'd think on opening weekend, NM would have been making an extra effort, not staffing the most popular cosmetics counters with angry cougars who act like their estrogen prescription ran out without refills. No thanks - I think I'm officially done.

OK, yes, the beer list is incredible. It's an amazing way to try new stuff and find new favorites to add to your drunky ass repertoire. The much-discussed Orange Blossom beer is pretty good, but not so good I would make a trip out of the way to get it.  The food is standard bar food. Well, despite the fabu beer list, this is just a bar when it comes down to it. Vegetarians, take warning - eat elsewhere, unless a overstuffed, not-entirely-melted cheese quesadilla is your idea of a kick ass meal. To be fair, my SO loved his brat and gobbled that sausage down like a pro. (I've always wanted to say that.) Our server was helpful and attentive. The ambiance is somewhat non-existent and, as someone else mentioned, the seating layout is fragmented.   My biggest beef is with the other customers! I've been to many a shithole bar and never have my eardrums been so bruised and battered, my throat raw from having to scream conversation over the relentless mating calls of the idiot Woo Girls at the dart boards. I mean, people were staring. The manager had to ask them to STFU multiple times. And this was before 9 p.m.  And they were not 18 with fake IDs; these ladies may have been older than me (gasp! shudder!).  If I wanted to listen to piercing screams while consuming a shitty quesadilla, I would have gone to a Filiberto's in Maryvale. Ugh. My SO will have to get his Papago fix on his own.

Schizophrenic fun at reasonable prices -- what else could you want from an antiques mall. Sure, there's some stalls full of what looks like garage sale leftovers, but most of the stuff is solid -- a nice blend of furniture and larger items admixed with the trinkets and collectibles. I never, ever, ever leave empty handed, even if it's just a few old Pyrex lab beakers or vintage liquor promo glasses. The only problem with this place is that it takes way too much time to really do it right!

Harlow's is worth the long haul from downtown Phoenix on a lazy weekend morning.  Yes, we could go to Matt's, but why wait for over half an hour with nothing to look at but the downtown see-and-be-seen art crowd and straggling suburbanites?  Or, I could go to Le Grande, but my breasts (and diamonds) aren't big enough.  No thanks.  Harlow's amazing (and reliable) food, good friendly service, the hot waitresses, the eclectic mix of patrons, and the four types of hot sauce on each and every table make this place my favorite.  Note: only 4 stars because it IS a little pricey for breakfast food ($9 for eggs Benedict), and because you will run into someone you know, not good if you are all tore up from the night before.

Carnivores and junk-foodies, don't be put off when your crunchy granola friends want to drag you to Green. This fare may be vegan, but it doesn't look it, taste it, or is healthy for you at all. Don't get me wrong: it is completely, totally, and utterly delicious. Their fries were far superior to many traditional burger joints'. But... they're still FRENCH FRIES, people. The jerk tofu salad was impressively spicy, but laden in too-many FRIED won ton strips and chunks of FRIED tofu. Do you see the theme? No wonder my SO nodded enthusiastically throughout the whole meal and offered to come back any time.   I had the G po-boy, buffalo "chicken" on a big spongy roll, dripping and oozing in spicy sauce and vegan mayo. The fake meat they use is really, really, really authentic. Like, so authentic, I'm not going to get it next time because I really don't like meat in the first place, hence my vegetarianism. Stringy fibers in my fake chicken grosses me out as much as the stringy fibers in real chicken. The sandwich was tasty -- the bread surprisingly excellent -- but greasy.   So yeah. Two hesitant thumbs up. I'll definitely go again, although I'll have to dig a little deeper on the menu to find something not quite so artery hardening.

This Tempe mainstay has the best selection of all things boozy in the entire city, and I would venture to suggest it's the best in the state. I'm not entirely sure how this pint size store manages to trump the warehouse liquor stores, but it does. Never have I come here with a specific esoteric item in mind and left empty-handed. The staff is comprised of dirty-scruffy-hippie boys that are actually kind of cute, and they know their biz. When I once demanded an unusual cheap sweet champagne, the dude immediately found three or four options in the disarray. The one I picked up sent my impossible-to-please daddy over the moon to the point of peeling the label off the bottle so he could go buy some himself.   Yes, it's crowded and gets warm in the summer. Yes, it's a little more expensive. It's worth it. They were the first ones to stock espresso vodka. They have a brand of brandy that comes in a huge glass container shaped like a machine gun. The have bottles of Gulden Draak that are economy-size. It's the only liquor store in the city that actually looks, feels, and smells like an old-school Chicago liquor store. What else do you need?

After a long and tumultuous affair with Buffalo Exchange (first visit, circa 1993), I've had it with them. I brought a bunch of OK stuff (neatly folded, clean, and wrinkle-free) in a laundry basket as well as a couple of worn but still very desirable and in fashion Tory Burch shoes. As soon as I saw the overweight rockabilly chick doing the buying, I knew I was screwed. Those girls, with the dyed black hair, Bettie bangs, red lipstick, and loss of sense of time, are universally angry and aggro.  Rockabilly went through all my shit and proceeded to wad it up into crumpled balls after she pissed on it as being too uncool or from the wrong store or whatever. She put her powdered nose waaay up in the air over the Tory Burch's, sniffing that they had soooo many already for sale. OK, I didn't see a single pair, but I did see all kinds of nasty Target and Old Navy items that would have probably been more appropriate for a Maryvale garage sale. I didn't even find a single thing that maybe I would consider trying on. Garbage.  So I go to the counter to get my ID back and collect my cash and I am so pissed that all the rejected stuff was now wrinkled all to hell. They gave me something like $80 for the stuff they deigned to take and they had to write me a check. Really? You don't have $80 in cash in the register? The giggling dingbat behind the counter said she had to find the manager to sign said check. While she's gone, I'm steaming and am ready to ask to speak to said manager about the shoddy way the rejects were tossed back into the laundry basket....  ....but the manager turned out to be Rockabilly.  Sigh.  So instead, pointing to the basket, I suggested to the Giggler that, should they ever have, like, a staff meeting, maybe they should discuss taking the extra three seconds to fold someone's things to resemble their original condition. She giggled and handed my check over and acted as if I hadn't said a word.  Unbelievable.  I don't care how young you are, how punk rock you think you are, or how badass you think you are. You treat your customers like CUSTOMERS.  Bye-bye, Buffalo... it's been a long and painful road.

Overpriced, overhyped, and completely underwhelming.   The much ballyhooed sangria is suspiciously reminiscent of the Livingston kind you can get by the 1.5 L bottle at Wal-mart for $5.97. Don't get me wrong: I am fond of said sangria, but cheap and voluminous is on its side. Caffe Boa sangria is $5 or $6 a glass, which is mostly ice, with an afterthought of an orange slice and a sorry maraschino cherry. (To be fair, the second glass we had at the dinner table had a few token blueberries and a strawberry chunk tossed in for good measure.)   The menu is kind of limited. Not an overabundance of options for your vegetarian friends. The pastas start at $13 and I saw something likely involving a steak at the $31 mark. Wooooo! I thought I was on Mill Avenue...? The crowd of extremely trashed and screaming college kids at the bar reaffirmed this, and I am really not so down with paying Scottsdale prices for a squealing co-ed experience.   I had a salad with sad, droopy leaves and too few chunks of feta and spicy pecans to break up the soggy monotony. The bread that comes out before was tasty, but the accompanying sauces disappointingly bland. The only partially saving grace was the bruschetta, although I could have done without the drizzle of syrupy balsamic, which overpowered the fresh tomatoes with sweetness.  We didn't even stay for dessert, and for us, that says a lot. Total mediocrity, across the board.

My favorite place to go when the weather becomes a tick cooler than the seventh circle of hell.  Best French onion soup on the planet, and a most fantastic variety of beer (plus good cocktails, if that's what the doctor calls for).    The best part has already been mentioned -- that there is a huge variety of people come here and everything goes.  There is nothing you could show up in that would raise eyebrows, as evidenced by Greg P.'s most amusing nut hugger shorts and vomit story.  Love!

Caveat: You totally gotta be in the mood for this place, and by in the mood I mean ready to fight the crowds, scream your conversations, and miss three-quarters of what your friend just said. However, the always-entertaining people watching, endless foo-foo drink menu, and give-a-shit atmosphere helps counteract that. Eye candy for everyone, really, and I love watching the outfits and makeup people pull off.  I think the staff is pretty friendly, and I'm so not a 21-year-old, totally built gay dude. We went there during Pride, and there was a $3 Smirnoff special going on. So I screamed my order to one of the cute bartenders who somehow misheard it and made two vodka-crans instead of one. No problem for me, as it actually would save me another trip to the bar, but the little cutie was actually embarrassed and wouldn't let me pay for both... and when I tried to leave him a fat tip he actually tossed it back at me.   The gross overconsumption of vodka led to the place of no return, the dance floor, where I embarrassed myself thoroughly with my shiteous white girl dancing. At Amsterdam, though, nobody gives a shit. That's pretty cool. The uber-techno remixes of Ke$ha songs I've never heard do get old, but hell, it's part of the scene.   So, in summary, a super fun place to hit up when you're in the mood to  hang out, get shitty, and let your freak flag fly without people giving you the snotty up-and-down look. Hell, we even ended up dancing here one night when we'd gone out right after work, and no one looked twice at a bunch of losers in scrubs. Nowhere else do you get that! Love.

So I think it's absurd to wait four hours and get treated like shit by a snotty, hipper-than-thou "hostess" for the sake of average pizza. So sue me. Even if their pizza was the second coming, I probably still wouldn't go in protest of their rude staff with pseudocelebrity attitudes. Unfortunately, they don't have to care -- thanks to dumbshit Oprah, the masses will continue to come. That's OK -- they can have my place in line.

One of my very favorite places on the planet, and one that I would miss from the bottom of my cold black soul if I ever moved away.  I've been going to Last Chance for 12 years now, and it has seen me through college, crappy jobs, graduate school, my first real job, and many pants sizes.  Even now that I can afford to pay retail -- I can't stop going.  Why pay $120 for those velour Juicy cargo pants, when I can pay 29.90?  And at that price, I can get them in three colors!   I haven't paid full price for sneakers in forever.   While there is much sifting through trashed, worn out stuff, enduring the shrill screaming of numerous poorly behaved children, and strategically avoiding the shriveled up batty old Last Chance hawks (who resell everything on eBay)  the $19 black cashmere long sleeve t shirt I got last time was worth every second.

God DAMN I just love this place. My visit last night was complete reaffirmation of why Last Chance is one of the best reasons to live in Phoenix. Two pairs of black Uggs, short and tall. Black over-the-knee flat suede boots. Black leather knee high slouchy boots with a cone heel that look quite similar to the totally-sold-out-and-unaffordable-anyway Balenciaga version. Theory tank top - basic white, not some garish color that didn't sell. Citizens of Humanity wide leg trouser jeans, with the tags still on, $9.99! Black "jeggings" (yes, jeans/leggings). Some Juicy velour pants, because I needed another pair like a hole in the head. ALL FOR $250. The stupid tall Uggs are $200 ALONE if you pay retail.   My main problem with Last Chance is that it COMPLETELY RUINS me from paying retail for anything. For real.

This place is the Pizzeria Bianco of the Phoenician Mexican food world -- excruciatingly long waits, questionably overpriced, occasionally brusque staff. Unlike PB (which represents a wildly successful marketing coup), Los Dos is a wonderful little oasis in the armpit of South Phoenix. My SO and I have been going for an embarrassing number of years (and, accordingly, the staff is super welcoming and we rarely wait). He occasionally demands a birthday dinner there, Los Dos style -- they turn the lights off, bang pots and pans, scream their heads off, and bring a festive dessert.  Yes, the food is hot. Do you not know this when you go? I mean, you don't drive by this place on your way to the mall and think 'gee, we should try that sometime'. You are going to be in pain at both ends, my friends, but it's delicious. Even their sour cream is special, tweaked by the addition of subtle flavors of mysterious spices.  The margaritas may have grown weaker over the years, or perhaps my liver has just ramped up to keep pace. I've gotten falling down sloppy shitfaced here many a time.   The haters are just pissed off that the staff served their bratty attitudes right back to them instead of kissing their plump asses as they are so accustomed to and/or they are transferring their embarrassment about being pussies about the hot food. Tough titty. More for us!

AZ88 defies categorization.   Location? Total suck. Tucked away behind an obnoxious parking garage in the middle of *shudder* Old Town Scottsdale. Completely and totally inconvenient for Phoenicians who don't want to drive half an hour home sloshed. I know, I'm such a party pooper. Watching the other sloshed drivers run their SUVs with rooftop cargo carriers into the supporting beams is pretty amusing, though. They were Canadian, eh.  Ambiance? Schizophrenic, much like the patrons. Lots of mirrors and sleek lines, but not IKEA modern... try Miami Vice modern. Seating is generally tight and uncomfortable, and it's loud as hell. The bathrooms certainly are infamous, being all unlabeled with semitransparent doors and shit. The individual stalls are completely lined with mirrors so you can admire yourself doing your business from all angles. However, either I've lost ten pounds without realizing it or those mirrors are slimming and elongating, like those circus ones. I'd like one at home, please.  Patrons? Well, I swear to you that every single time I've gone to AZ88, there has been a bachelorette party, resplendent with plastic tiaras and squealing girls in slutty Forever 21 dresses tipsy on champagne.  Next to them, though, is a couple in their 60s who practically have $100 bills oozing from their pores. Endless examples of plastic surgery, good and bad. Gay boys in tight jeans and spray tans with huge martinis, checking their iPhones. College kids. Cougars. Children. Really. It's like an endless parade of absurdity.   Drinks? Now we're talking. You'd think a place this cheesy would have lame watered down foo foo drinks. Au contraire! The drink menu is pages long and chock full of old favorites. Rusty Nail! Brandy Alexander! Bring! It! On! The beer list is manageable but contains obscure favorites such as Chimay (in practically gallon size bottles).  Food? Vegetarians, rejoice. AZ88 has a delicious roasted vegetable plate that is big enough to provide three more meals. If you're feeling a little lacto-ovo, go for the grilled cheese (minus the bacon), stuffed full with thick slices of tomato. Really, it's just an excuse to get my paws on those scrumptious, much-ballyhooed waffle fries. The burgers look incredible and both my dad and SO (two of the pickiest, whiniest people on the planet) love them. The desserts are amazing too. I swear their hot fudge is laced with a hint of cherry. Killer.  Service? Pretty damn good, given the circumstances. Our server even scared up some BBQ for my fries, even after telling me they didn't have any. Pretty cool.  So really? Good drinks, excellent people watching, and goddamn waffle fries? No contest. Now, if we could just relocate a little closer...

This place needs another good review like a hole in the head, but too bad. Any place that my uber-picky, easily disgruntled, vociferously opinionated tipsy father finds no fault with should be heralded with a choir.   The Deluxtini, which you feel like a dumbass ordering, is some concoction of orange vodka, pineapple juice, champagne, and peach nectar. $11 sounds like a lot until you see the shaker that comes out with it -- easily, there's three full martini glasses' worth in it. Okay, I was solidly buzzed. The beer list is huge, and they have my SO's Chimay, so bonus points there.  I love sweet potato fries, even these, which were a bit on the flaccid side. The much-heralded orange sauce is tasty as well. The roasted vegetable panini was excellent, but not quite cheesy enough; next time I will stick with the grilled cheese panini, which is a fatty bit of heaven. My dad and SO split a burger and the caprese panini, and again, both seemed relatively content, a rarity.  Dessert (chocolate cake and a vanilla malt) and coffee were generously portioned and delicious.   Our server was fabulous - very helpful, friendly, genuine, and never once tried to rush us out of there, even when it got super busy. Oh yeah, and we get to the minus-one-star area: it's fucking busy. The parking lot is a Range Rover disaster waiting to happen. The whole shopping center is really a trendy yuppie Mecca - pure chaos.  Getting there early, as we did, circumvented some of that, but in general - it's verging on a Xanax moment.

My darling SO just looooooves this place, supposedly because they have a BLT that comes with avocado and a half-cooked egg on it. Ummm... OK. When he finally dragged me here, I realized he probably likes it because the waitresses hit on him. (Honeybuns, if you're reading this, they'll do anything for a tip. ANYthing...!?)  I got a veggie egg white omelet, which had all my favorite components of caramelized onions and broccolini, but it tasted as if they had sauteed the veggies in the drippings from the burgers that just came off the grill. Uh, gross. This alone takes the rating to two stars, and I'm not even a super-strict vegetarian. It's just disgusting. The English muffin was this weird little hockey puck that really served no purpose other than to serve as a vehicle for the tasty, homemade apricot preserves that came on the side. The chocolate cherry scones were delish and the coffee quite good.  The booth next to us held three 20-somethings (two dudes and a chick) downing mimosas, still wasted from the night before, who thought it fun to play their cell phones and/or iPods at high volumes. Just annoying as shit. Later, when I visited the swanky bathrooms, I saw the girl out crying in the lobby. Guess the swordfight didn't end well.  I'll go back, so my SO can continue to get his ego stroked and his cholesterol raised, but I'm staying away from things from the grill...

Sometimes, I feel like I'm the only person in Phoenix who doesn't totally adore Tammie Coe.  The baked goods fall prey to the classic AJ's bakery syndrome: everything looks a helluva lot better than it tastes. It's not to say the products taste bad per se... but they're a little on the bland side, which is really a bummer because I feel like the ingredients are good quality and fresh, just not bursting with flavor.   This location is also really cramped and the staff are a little confused (albeit friendly). I had to explain what a cafe au lait was, before someone made it into a breve, which is totally disgusting to even think about.   The upsides are that many of the baked goods come in little bitty sizes, handy for those of us who don't want a muffin or scone the size of our heads. Also, they open at the ass-crack of dawn (read: 6:30 am), early enough for those of us who like to arrive at the office with a hot coffee by 7 am.

Four little words: Gulden Draak. On draft. FTW!  Because my SO was kind-hearted enough to come with me to Fashion Square on the Saturday after Thanksgiving DURING the ASU-U of Gay game, I thought it was only fair we make a pit stop at the YH to catch the last quarter. The 10.5% alcohol in said Gulden Draak was probably not the best thing for our rabid, violent Sun Devil fan to consume, in retrospect, but I had fun anyway, people watching on the outside patio in the gorgeous cool cloudy weather while my SO foamed at the mouth. The service was excellent and the neighboring tables' food looked and smelled quite tasty. We'll be back! No better way to recharge, mid-spending-spree (although post-cocktails drunky shopping may get you in a bit of trouble).

This place has become a vegetarian's wet dream. In addition to having a killer beer selection, they have incorporated faux meats into their menu, thus veggifying over a dozen selections. I've had the fake meat in a salad, and it's very realistic - almost too much so! However, the most amazing item on the menu has nothing to do with fake meat: the grilled cheese.   TO. DIE. FOR.   Seriously one of the top 5 grilled cheeses. The tomatoes inside are roasted so they're sweet, warm, soft, and flavorful (as opposed to the usual sad treatment tomatoes get: simply sliced and put in the middle, cold, thus ensuring the surrounding cheese will never get hot enough to melt). The accompanying tomato soup is delicious as well. I snarfed it all down and practically licked the plate clean.  The service is always prompt and friendly also.   Minus a wee fraction of a star because smoking is allowed on the patio.

Broccolini, spicy peppers, and thin crust pizza. You combine three of my favorite things and you get the Rocket Man. So very good. LGO manages to keep its wood fired crusts substantial and bready, yet never, ever flaccid (unlike other so-called wood fired pizza joints *ahem*Bianco*cough*Cibo).   I'm knocking off a star because the place is always yuppie pandemonium, and you have to watch your ass in the parking lot because it's full of Range Rovers driven by women who don't know how to maneuver a large vehicle. But, they get part of that star back for the adjacent gelato shop. Perfection.

OK, it's a travesty to not like this place. I get it. The concept of tapas is fabulous for grazers like myself, and I would be all over it if there wasn't a single thing on the menu not involving the flesh of dead creatures. OK, an exaggeration. But it's very meat-heavy.  This much-raved about sangria? We had the white. Yes, there were chunks of fruit in it - like most sangria. It wasn't knocking me out, especially for however much that was for the pitcher. It was a lot.  I was not aware of the "cozy" seating until too late. Maybe I'm an asshole, but in general I have no desire to be slammed up against a group of strangers, screaming to be heard in a conversation with my friends.   Well, no matter - this place seems to have plenty of followers. You guys can have my seat.

Roasted garlic plate: Orgasmic. Slow-roasted, sweet, smoky, soft spreadable ginormous cloves of stinky heaven, served with an array of mysterious dips and spreads, all warm and covered in melted cheese, ready for the spreadin'.   For the times when I expect to kiss my boyfriend again in the next five days, I forgo the garlicky goodness for veggie quesadillas (not on the menu, people): whatever veggies they have back there (broccolini, beets, Brussels sprouts, carrots, whatevs) folded into a delicious tortilla with just enough cheese. Served on a cutting board with amazing salsa on the side.... Nom nom nom.  No place else like it. Hands down. Eagerly awaiting Richardson's triumphant return....

What a weird little place. The "decor", if you will, is schizophrenic at best. The aforementioned white leather couches are odd, and everyone else gets to sit on Ace Hardware plastic folding chairs. Strangely, they're not too uncomfortable. The coffee is "eh". So-so. Even the so-called light roast stuff would put hair on my chest (not a good thing). The bakery items are bordering on stale and probably came from Safeway across the street. So why 4 stars?   Well, the place is pretty quiet, with unobtrusive, neutral rock playing at a pleasant, low volume. This is in stark comparison to other locales such as Lux (who doesn't love a DJ at 8 am?) and that something-Trade place down on Central (Lilith fair, anyone?). Seeing as I am cramming for board exams right now, I need unobtrusive. I also need space, for all my eighty thousand books and binders. There are plenty of generously sized tables here, plenty of room. And, perhaps most importantly, the owners don't have the A/C on FRIGID -- a rarity in AZ the second the mercury hits 90. I can sit here in a tank top and not freeze my ass off. Very important. The clientele is an interesting melange of people (at least during the day, when I'm here) who seem friendly and mellow.  The cooler has a very eclectic array of fancy waters, Mexican Coke in real glass bottles, and chi-chi designer sodas. Cool.  Oh, and yeah, and you don't have to ask the person working here for the damn bathroom key. I. HATE. THAT.  So, despite the unexciting coffee and bakery offerings, I think I will be back.... at least until my boards are over!

Went here for my birthday a couple weeks ago.  Who knew four people could eat and drink that much?  Cheese and wine heaven.... and that hot pretzel with the most spectacular mustard is stuff gastro dreams are made of.

Slightly pretentious, definitely pricey, but worth a trip for the macarons. They're not MACAROONS, people, those are the little cookie mountains of shredded coconut. Macarons are a French confection of two moist, flourless cookies flanking a filling or ganache. Essence's are just delicious - as are most of their baked goods, admittedly. Perfectly chewy with a crisp edge and just enough filling, all with a not-overly-sweet, almondy taste. I could easily consume one of each flavor over coffee and a book. And maybe I will. So there.

I got dragged here for a work outing by my co-workers, who think very highly of their bar and restaurant choices in general. Like, verging on snotty. That should have been my first red flag. Learning that we would be sitting outside in the dead of the Phoenix summer was the next. Who wants to sit outside sweating their ass off, trying to make chit-chat with the boss' husband? No, thank you.  Now, mind you, I am much more of a Bikini girl. PBR in a plastic pitcher is okey dokey dandy. Once in a while, I like to get dressed up and go suck down $12 martinis. That's cool. The Vig is in no-man's-land. A crappy part of town, on the fringes of the ghetto, with pricey drinks and food and a strange see-and-be-seen atmosphere that really belongs in Old Town. It doesn't vibe with the whole having to park my car across the street next to the check cashing place, hoping I don't get a ticket experience. The decor? OK. Nothing to write home about. Again, $12 martinis and heels are fine if the place is smokin. The Vig is not. It's not even really smoldering, despite the too cool for you attitudes of the staff.  No, thank you!

I managed to go years without going back to this overpriced joke of a bar, but as they say, time heals all wounds.  One trip back, though, and you can bet your ass it's the last. A mediocre burger, an adolescent grilled cheese (with American cheese, on white bread, with crusts cut off), a split side salad composed mostly of Iceberg lettuce, and a few drinks = $100+. Um.... NO.  The menu straight up sucks for vegetarians, despite the little "We can accommodate vegans, just ask!" blurb on the menu. I shudder to think what that might entail. Certainly, more Iceberg lettuce.   I hate that the parking is mostly monopolized by the valet service. Pretentious and unnecessary.  The drinks were meh and the last one that came out wasn't even what I ordered.   If you have fistfuls of cash and a desire to see and be seen, then by all means, go to the Vig. But if you're just average, neighborhood folk who want to sit outside, have some yummy chow and get your drink on for a reasonable sum... keep walkin'.

Qcumberz is a pretty cool place, despite the cheesy name. They have loads and loads of junk, intermixed with hidden gems. So it takes some searching and sifting to find the prizes... it's definitely not a 10-minute endeavor. You will get dirty, dusty, and, if it's May through October, hot and sweaty. Qcumberz is kind of like Sage for people without fistfuls of expendable income and with tons of time... I furnished (using that term loosely) much of my 1950s condo with items from Qcumberz on a grad student's pittances. The parking situation totally blows there, but you do get the opportunity to flip off the protestors at the neighboring Planned Parenthood clinic, so maybe it all balances out?

I am MORTIFIED to admit that I have just now been to Figs for the first time after living and shopping in CenPho for years. Honestly - the name put me off. "Figs" conjures up a mental image of chippy white painted iron pieces and gingham-lined jelly jars and back issues of Country Living. I realize it stands for "Fine Interior Garden Spaces" -- what can I say. However, a feverish quest for unique backyard planters drew me in recently, with the promising word "Garden" finally overpowering the adverse effect of "Figs".   The place is schizo, in a good way. Antique pieces, new stuff, knickknacks, gifts, furniture, jewelry, you name it, it's here. Figs is part Anthropologie, part Sage (RIP), part flea market, part European bazaar, and all fabulous. All the goodness is packed VERY tightly though, making it challenging to take it all in. Big and/or clumsy and/or claustrophobic peeps, not good for you. Price points appear to be fairly middle ground -- not inexpensive, but not angina inducing.  I found a massive (and relatively inexpensive) metal antique beverage cooler to serve as a planter, as well as an ancient steel Hoosier cabinet and a funky industrial mirror which I totally did not need but could not resist. Once he realized I was actually going to drop some change, the owner stopped following me around as if I was going to slip an item into my bag and became friendly and helpful. He wrapped my items up safely and put the cabinet in my car for me -- much appreciated.   I will definitely be back  -- Figs is an easy one-stop shop for gifts, and it's full of inspiration for the home -- and I would be back sooner rather than later if I could just find a damn place for that antique pie safe I was lusting after...

And, my dear friends, that's four stars based on takeaway ALONE -- I can imagine, when accompanied by the legendary array of British beers, this will easily make the coveted five star mark. Yummy, greasy, down-home comfort food goodness... and enough vegetarian selections to keep me going for quite a while. Looking forward to having a meal there!

My favorite Middle Eastern restaurant in all of eternity is Haji Baba in Tempe. Is it any wonder, then, why I am so deflatedly underwhelmed by MBFGR? If you want a real hamburger, you don't go to Denny's, you go to Chuck Box. My analogy stands. Totally bland and mediocre food, flavors distilled to barely detectable levels for the masses. The saginaki is good, but not bursting with tangy lemony sizzling energy like it should. The server's half-hearted "opa" was fitting. They don't even light it next to the table anymore, making me wonder if their liability insurance put the kibosh on such activities after a particular incident, maybe or maybe not involving the singing off of a customer's facial hair. The spinach salad was absolutely coated in a syrupy balsamic dressing that was practically cloying in its sweetness. The pita is good, although its thick, spongy, white-bread consistency isn't particularly what I expect in a good pita. The sangria was a tick superior to Boone's. Meh all around.

Most post offices are the embodiment of government inefficiency. Understaffed, bleary, grumpy workers, limited and inconvenient hours, zero point zero customer service effort, lines fifteen people deep, you know the drill.  The Van Buren post office is a small gift from God, because it's TOTALLY THE OPPOSITE. They have extended hours, rad for those of us with actual jobs that keep us occupied between 8 am and 5 pm. They are always fully staffed with real live, smiling, helpful people who seem to enjoy their jobs. More than once, they've helped me figure out a cheaper way to send stuff and have even helped me jam stuff into smaller boxes to save some cash. The self-serve kiosk is always fully stocked and functional.   Plus, my local Arcadia location is like a depressing United Nations gathering, full of depressed-looking people who appear wasted and/or haven't showered in four days. The Van Buren location is usually pretty empty, but once there were a couple of teenagers trying to send live chickens through the mail, which was pretty awesome.

Located prominently on Camelback just east of Rosie's, Urban Southwest is one of those places you drive past all the time but have never gone to. After finishing a 7th Ave. junk shop run one Saturday afternoon, we were heading home when my SO said, "What about that place? It looks kinda cool..." One quick illegal U-turn later, and we're parked on the side of the building. I can already see all kinds of cool shit made from scrap (okay, "reclaimed"/"salvaged") wood and I'm stoked!  The space is indeed made up of an old house with hodgepodge additions, and it's literally a maze of hidden surprises. The word "Southwest" had always put me off because it conjures up way too many mental images of turquoise kokopellis and Indian blankets and shit. It's really a misnomer in this case; nary a single cheesy touristy item is to be seen. There's so many finalists for my revered dining room table spot, I can barely narrow it down. I end up deciding on the perfect table, which I learn is made from wood salvaged from an old house demolished locally. The owner, Nick, steered us towards these really nice looking faux-leather chairs for the table and gave us a pretty good deal on them too. The only catch was that he only had two and so we had to wait.... and wait.... and wait.... for the others to come in. Sort of a pain in the ass but Nick offered to lend us other chairs till we had the full set of four.   Very fun and eclectic place with unique items at all price points -- from $25 picture frames to completely over the top but amazingly unique leather lounge chairs that may or may not cost the equivalent of the annual GDP of a small 3rd world country. Not that I would know anything about the latter. Nope.

Yay: good location -- close to me and easy to get to. Yay: free reliable WiFi.  Meh: the coffee. Not falling over good, but not burnt up, heartburn-inducing Starbucks style either.  Meh: the food. Now, granted, I haven't been for lunch, but the a.m. selection does not knock me out. I would think a place as hippie-dippie and crunchy granola as this would be somewhat into remotely healthy food. Instead there were lots of bagels, greasy croissants, etc. The only thing on my vegetarian, health-conscious radar was whole wheat banana bread, which was totally blah and not even really banana-y.  Boo: having to get a key to get into the bathroom. I understand the point, but as someone who will pee every hour for the entire duration of my stay, not cool. Boo: crappy LOUD Lilith Fair-esque music. Sorry, I left my strap-on at home. Maybe at night when people are just hanging the tunes would be ok, but in the morning I saw lots of poor downtrodden souls like me hunched over laptops, books, or in serious conversation with someone else in a business suit... people who were actually trying to, you know, WORK.  As much as I want to support independent businesses, I highly doubt I'll be back... there's just too many other great places to go.

The last time I actually seriously raised my voice in anger at another live human being was at some stupid twit at Cox. I despise this company, their brain-dead staff, their total lack of customer service, and their completely inane policy of constantly stalker-calling their CURRENT customers for telemarketing. Hate. Pure, unrequited HATE.

I dumped my last dentist because he talked to me like I was about five years old. As an adult, I take offense. As a physician, I take extra offense.   So my friend recommended Dr. Steen, citing a centrally located gorgeous office, modern facilities, and really hot office staff. I don't particularly care about the last part, but good to know.  From my first phone call to the check-out at the end of my visit, the office staff was endlessly patient and took the time to thoroughly explain everything. The facilities are very impressive, meticulously clean and spacious. Dr. Steen is very pleasant and was the happy medium between strong and silent and way too chatty. His exam was amazingly thorough, as were his comments throughout regarding what he saw. He didn't try to hard sell me any unnecessary procedures and didn't try to scare me into flossing with threats of periodontal disease, receding gums, or rotting teeth. The staff never looked at me funny when I arrived red-faced and huffing and puffing from hauling ass from the hospital to get to my appointment on time, which is always appreciated.   The cherry on top is their on-line service for patients that lets you view your appointment times and sign up to get reminders by text message, which is perfect for me.   My only complaint was that I had to make two separate appointments for the exam and the cleaning; however, once I realized how much time Dr. Steen spent during the examination, I understand! (Plus, we were working around a time crunch and my tight schedule.)

My family has been going to Allison for probably about 10 years now and have followed her from spa to spa. Her current location is small and inviting, albeit somewhat isolated in waaaaay north Scottsdale for someone coming from downtown -- and I mean Phoenix. The decor is gorgeous. Every massage I've ever had there -- from any therapist -- has been superior to my experiences at notoriously chi-chi locales such as the Camelback. Everyone is super friendly and services are top-notch. I certainly wouldn't go elsewhere for a massage, gas prices be damned.

It was like I tripped over a crack in the sidewalk, stumbled into a time warp, and emerged in suburban Chicago in 1985, when I still knew all the words to the Super Bowl Shuffle by heart.   Hard. Core. Chicago. This does not mean the pizza is, per se, good. It will probably come across repellent to those who think Uno's is all Chicago pizza represents. To the Chosen, though, it is excellent - sweet sauce, gooey cheese, thin-yet-chewy crust, all cut into the requisite squares, and infinitely better as leftovers the next day.  Oh, and a little secret: BYOB.

Hey, veggie friends: they will make any salad for you, sans poultry, and knock a bit off the price, without even being asked. That is pretty darn cool. The staple tomato soup is killer, and comes with a warm piece of garlic bread. The desserts? My god. So tempting. So delicious.   The seating isn't bad. It's like a regular restaurant, with nice booths, except you seat yourself after paying first at the cafeteria-style front. A nice man will then hover, refilling your diet Cokes and clearing your plates, and eventually will end your meal with a thank you card and minty chocolates. So nice!   Yes, it costs a little more, but it's a hell of a lot better than getting in a ponytail-pulling fistfight over a table in the food court downstairs. Total yum!

It's like a Hollywood movie -- a quickly shifting melange of love, hate, contempt, and indigestion. An apt analogy for a place that names the flavors in retarded LA fashion, such as "Rich and Famous", "Skinny Mini", and "Blondie", and even glazes the top of each cupcake with luminescent gold powder just as heavily as a PV girl piles on Orgasm blush (and is just as shimmery).   I'd had a big lunch, so thought the vegan lemon "Skinny Mini" was apropos. The first two or three bites? Heaven. Freaking heaven. Then some funky aftertaste set in and my pancreas curdled trying to squirt out enough insulin to get all that freaking sugar gone. My SO got the red velvet one, which was a LOT better than my vegan monstrosity, and he even generously declared it the best cupcake he'd ever had. I stared longingly as he gulped his all down, not offering to share more than the one initial taste. I tried to pawn off the remnants of the Mini on him, but even he couldn't stomach it. Sadly, we ended up pitching half of it. And at $3.50 or something per, that's a waste.   Will I try it again? If I'm in the neighborhood, and you can bet your taut, spray-tanned ass that I will be going for the full fat version this time.

As per usual, I find reviewing big chains a bit trite. And, not unlike previous reviewers, I once loved this Safeway, itself an urban legend of cleanliness and customer service. Weelllllll.....  .... the tide has turned. Once a spectacular bastion of people watching and friendliness in the Gayborhood has become a pit stop for all things ghetto, dirty, and angry. One of the new pharmacy staff is beyond clueless. The deli staff is completely put out by the fact you are standing there, hogging their oxygen. The pop machine by the deli is an explosion of soda water sans syrup. The poor woman working the Starbucks in the morning is always by herself (read: 10 minutes, at least, for the a.m. jolt) because her co-worker always comes in an hour late. The crusty people loitering and using the wifi look like they're just casing the joint (and/or your car).   It's really too bad, to watch a spiffy place like this start its descent. While I will admit watching the undercover security staff tackle some dude for trying to steal vodka is entertaining, it's not the sort of thing I wish to encounter every time I pick up milk. Suffice it to say I have this Unsafeway only for emergencies now.... RIP.

Yay! Two dirty, paint-covered and callused thumbs-up. Having recently purchased a bank-owned home, I have spent the last two months dutifully replacing every single stinking item the idiot prior owners stole. Some things are more fun to replace than others. New light fixtures? Okay, fun. Faucets? Sure, cool. But trim rings for recessed lights? Not so much. Especially when I found out they ran for $12 each... um, WHAT???  Almost eight hundred bucks on stupid metal rings just so my house will look less ghetto? And so commenced my search for reasonably priced trim rings. After finding them online somewhere for just over five bucks a pop, I ended up at Construction Lots one desperate afternoon. Lo and behold, they had boxes and boxes of the stupid little bastards... $8 each. Long story short, the attentive manager heard my plight and sold me all 65 kits for just over $5 each. Hell yes! I'd rather give my business to a local shop and save on shipping anyway. Construction Lots has made it to the top tier of my rotation for home improvement items, indeed. Many thanks to the awesome staff there and I'm sure I will see you all soon as I continue to knock the to-do items off my neverending list. One minor caveat, which is understandable given the close-out nature of their items: no returns. Make sure that faucet you buy actually fits. Not that I would buy a faucet without doing measurements or anything. Just sayin'.

This sorry shithole really could only survive in Touristville adjacent to the resort. Good God! I actually felt like my wallet got gang-raped for the experience: one dinner + one quesadilla appetizer + three margaritas = $60. What in the hell is that!? It would be one thing if the food was amazing.... but the so-called green chilis in my quesadilla were cut up raw mild boring jalapenos that added absolutely zero to the food (but cost an extra $2). The poor downtrodden quesadilla soon sweated an enormous pool of grease, which soaked its entire underside, rendering it inedible. One of my friends passed around a guac appetizer, and the raw onions in there would either put hair on your chest or singe it clean off, not sure which. Blech!  I will add a 1/2 star because the margaritas were tasty. Either they used high end tequila, or there was no booze at all in there. For the price, I would hope it was nice tequila. Clearly, since I can't really tell either way, there wasn't much in there. I could also go so far as to add a half star for the ambiance. Total old-school Arizona touristy kitsch, and the patio was very nice for our group gathering. However, with the preponderance of wonderful places with outdoor seating, I doubt the patio alone would ever lure me back. See ya at Los Dos!

So, I don't eat seafood. Nope. None of it, much less raw. So when an Orthodox colleague was coming to town, where the hell was I supposed to take him? It's almost the beginnings of a bad joke: "An Orthodox Jew and a vegetarian walk into a bar..."   I pre-gamed on Chex Mix before dinner because I was afraid there was going be very little for me to eat. That was just stupid. The menu was so huge, I had a hard time making a selection. I tried the grilled sweet potatoes, broccolini, and this avocado roll thing with asparagus. OMG. Heaven. The food was incredible. I would totally offer to eat crow at this point about my skepticism, but being veg and all, yeah.  The service was superb. The server had the patience of a saint as the three of us diddled over the menu and ordered a little of everything. The honey sochu and pineapple cocktails were like candy and I easily would have downed twice as many had I not been with, you know, visiting coworkers. And, yes, it's stupid expensive; my share of the bill was $45. For veggies and two drinks. Oh well. I'd be lying if I didn't say I'm already plotting my next trip. Takeout?

It's a neighborhood British pub, people. Nothing more, nothing less, and for this I love it. The food is predictably tasty, with especially delicious onion rings. Their BBQ sauce is tangy/spicy perfection. The beer and wine selection is, again, predictable but perfectly adequate. I have never once had bad service here, and in fact everyone who works there seems pretty rad, genuinely cool. Whenever I come here, I invariably run into someone I know - like frigging Cheers. Who can complain?  Minus part of a star because veggie options are limited (not that I'm completely complaining when I'm in the mood for a greasy grilled cheese) and it's one of those places where people think it's okay to bring children. It's a BAR.

Add another "meh" to the list. We went on a Sunday morning, and despite the crowds loitering about, were able to sit immediately at the counter. The crowd was extremely see-and-be-seen, but then I guess it is next door to the (ugh) Vig in (ugh) Arcadia. The service was slow, the server pissy, the order wrong (without an apology), the coffee cup unrefilled. The food was okay, and while there were many tempting things on the menu, I can't say I'm dying to go back. I'll stick to the tried-and-true favorites (read: Harlow's).

I am a makeup whore, and that's fine. I recently rediscovered the joys of MAC after being sucked into the way high-end makeup world for the past few years, and man, MAC is the shit. It's not expensive, it's good quality, the selection is incredible, they give samples, the fragrances are killer... I could go on and on.   The only weird thing is that I think the sales staff is told to compliment every customer on something. It feels disingenuous. The last time I was in, I was "helped" by a totally disinterested girl whose own makeup looked so awesome, she could have sold me hundreds of dollars' worth if she had offered to replicate it on me. When she was ringing me up, she seemed to suddenly remember to toss out a random compliment, and afterwards she looked like she had just taken a fabulous dump, she was so pleased with herself.

Many, many stars for the mild and delicately flavored (i.e., not burnt to hell, sbux style) coffee! Very refreshing to not have to temper the glass of acid indigestion with fifteen Splenda packets. The dude working there was really nice, although in no hurry. I was hoping for a bigger selection of food, but it looked like biscotti from Costco was it for me. Maybe I was too late (9 am)? No worries -- I'll be back, when I'm in this part of town. A very pleasant surprise!

Best. Karaoke. Ever.  For my boyfriend's birthday, I went balls to the wall with their uber-fancy, 20+ person private karaoke room with its own patio. At $150 an hour, I was cringing a little at the outset. However, after a number of surprisingly inexpensive vodka cranberries ($5 each.... and this is Scottsdale!), I found myself fondling my boyfriend's boss as he sat on my lap while watching my normally prim liquored-up friends work the conveniently provided stripper pole like pros. Plenty of Journey, AC/DC, and Black Sabbath provided the perfect backdrop for the shenangians. We made sure to keep the door open even though the staff kept trying to tell us to close it, and even those too-cool-for-you Scottsdale fuckers walking by the bar were stopping and checking out the mayhem. Fabulous. It's almost a week later and people are still talking about it. This will be an annual birthday tradition -- mark my words. Worth every last penny.

Yes. Tempe Marketplace is akin to the seventh circle of hell. I completely agree. That said, it's worth it to brave the confused old farts and aggro shopper moms, if afterwards you can dull the pain with my latest most favorite thing ever, Jamaican Weed Sweet Tea vodka.   The selection is fabulous, the prices good, and the huge display of airplane bottles by the checkout is the ideal way for the impulse shopper to have a taste-testing extravaganza. There is an impressive variety of Torani syrups, which we like in our coffee around my house. Even the snacks and cheeses look delish (although I am reticent to purchase cheese or chocolate in August, lest they melt instantaneously). Finally, Bevmo offers me the prized ONE STOP SHOPPING for holiday and birthday gifts. "One for them, one for me. One for them, two for me." Fab!

I despise moving down to the very depths of my cold soul. I hate the packing, the sorting of shit, the cleaning, the process, the unpacking, the mess. HATE. I must say, though, Camelback Moving made the physical move quick and painless. Everyone I interacted with was professional and friendly to the utmost degree. The confirmatory calls came when they said they would, and so did the two guys, Alex and Chance. Despite my extremely disgusting, cat-hair-coated condo and fondness for heavy steel industrial furniture and life-size plastic skeletons, they were both endlessly pleasant and efficient. Amazingly, the walls at the old and the new place are no worse for the wear and nothing - NOTHING! - got broken despite my SO's inability to pack breakables intelligently. I wouldn't hesitate to use them again and I wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone - making one step of the process this easy helped make the entire day less stressful. Thanks guys!

Like others, I too wanted to love Maizie's. The menu looks like it has great potential and the happy hour looked promising. After a couple visits, I haven't been dying to go back, despite my friends' enthusiasm. The staff is perfectly friendly and service is OK. The food is OK, not amazing. I did have some kind of Brie soup that was like salted butter in a bowl -- pretty much inedible. The restaurant is kind of small, and gets really crowded, and for whatever reason there have been screaming kids every time I've gone. No thank you.  Eh. I'll go again if my friends drag me there, but I probably won't go on my own.

How in God's name can ice cream be boring? I'm not sure, but this place manages to do it. I've had a few different flavors, and it's generic, flavorless, flat, monotonous, and blah all around. Oh yeah, and not super cheap either.... mmm no thanks.

After stalker-calling all the Sephoras in the area for a certain product, the Sephora at San Tan is the only one that had it in stock. Of course.   You take the contents of any average mall and lay it out in a bastardized version of the 3rd Street shopping district in Santa Monica and put it in the middle of BFE and you get San Tan Village. It's literally a suburban hell: tons of poorly behaved children, soccer moms who can't park their SUVs, and bleach blond hair everywhere. Oh God, it was horrifying. And this is when the weather was actually nice. This place in the summertime would literally be hellish.  I don't remember the last time I was so thrilled to cross back into the Phoenix city limits. Home sweet ghetto home.

After passing my boards (!!!) my darling SO gave me a gift certificate for a spa manicure/pedicure at the Nordstrom Spa. Expensive and over the top like woah!   I was able to get an appointment the day after I called. It was similar to those previously described -- a little odd sitting in a communal area with your feet in a bowl of water, but totally forgotten once supine in the fancy kicked back recliner. The mani/pedi took a mind-boggling two hours and was amazing. I fell asleep at least twice, twitching and drooling and all.   That's all fine and dandy, but the proof is in the pudding: the mani lasted TEN DAYS, and it's not like I sit around with my hands in the air. I use them. The polish was flawless for DAYS AND DAYS. My pedi is still incredible. I am beyond impressed, but that shit ain't cheap. Until I'm making big super duper bank, I think I'll need to stick with the cheapo little Vietnamese places.

Just a little update to say I indulged in a massage here yesterday and absolutely must rave about the pummeling and ass-kicking I got from a deceivingly compact  and smiley girl named Andrea. This is the way a massage should be: part pleasure, part pain, and all therapeutic. Upon complimenting her, she simply shrugged and replied that she used to work on pro athletes until she wrecked her shoulder. That explains it. When I left, I looked like I got ridden hard and put away wet -- makeup all smeared away, hair frizzy and askew, dazed look in eyes. So. Worth. It. I already prebooked another massage for my next day off...

F&E is the IKEA of the grocery store world: cheap, questionable quality, faux-modern theme. This is definitely not a place where I would do all my grocery shopping, and it barely suffices for a quick after-work run to pick up ingredients for dinner. Their fresh cakes and desserts are very much keeping with the IKEA theme -- all looks, no substance. Blech.  The best thing about this place is their little half-baked house brand loaves of French bread or ciabatta bread, the kind you bake yourself for a few minutes. They are very small and perfect for one or two people. Larger fresh bread loaves always get stale instantly here so it's nice not to have leftovers. There is a similar small version of fresh bread at AJ's, but it's almost $3, where this is 99 cents and very tasty.

Chi-chi and pricey... def not a place I would go to on my own, but went for a work event. As the token vegetarian, I was a little nervous, but the roasted veggie plate was, admittedly, amazing. AMAZING. The pre-appetizer soup spoon of chopped tomatoes and Pop-Rocks was lame. I'm sorry. That, plus the cotton candy schtick, is just Trying Too Hard. Do you know what happens when you eat purple cotton candy? Your mouth, lips, and hands are dyed purple. Really? At a place with $30 plates? A failed attempt at kitsch, at least in my eyes.  The staff was perfectly friendly and attentive and I can totally see how people love this place. It would be a really good place to take a date you really wanted to impress or for a fancy occasion.

Disclaimer: I didn't actually *go* to the store, but instead was the lucky recipient of a straggling vanilla cupcake, bestowed upon me by a coworker after all the good ones were gone.  Now, I love me a cupcake. Just like pizza, there is no bad cupcake.  This cupcake was smallish, and since I don't know how much they are, I can't comment on the so-important price-size ratio. There was not a ton of icing, which I prefer. Too many places try to cover up a mediocre cake with gobs and gobs of vile buttercream icing.   The icing wasn't too slimy or fatty as buttercreams often are. Nice, light vanilla flavor.  The cake...... amazing. It was a tick on the dry side (maybe a consequence of its travels to my work) but the flavor? Incredible. Rich, velvety vanilla, with hints of almond and caramel. I mean, KILLER.   If I ever find myself in that corner of the Valley, you can be certain I'll stop in, but I don't think it's worth a special drive from central Phoenix.

While I still mourn the passing of the most rad Coffee Plantation ever, its replacement, True Foods, is a quite acceptable substitute.   It's based on some cheesy anti-inflammatory diet by some doctor. Yeah - real helpful, I know. I'm sure there's plenty written about it, so why waste your time and mine rehashing it?  I have been to TF a few times. The decor is gorgeous, and I love the outdoor patio. I met a friend there the other night. He was late (tsk, tsk), leaving me sitting by my lonesome on the patio surrounded by cougars and Scottsdaleites. Some staff member - a supervisor, maybe, as he wasn't in uniform - took pity on me and brought a little kale salad for me to nibble on, gratis. How sweet, but..... kale? Um... OK... BUT... dressed in olive oil, lemon juice, toasted bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, and chili flakes, kale is KILLER! Who knew? Fresh, clean, and delicious. I'm getting the big version next time.  Our server, like all servers I've had there, was genuine, helpful, and friendly. She brought us a bit of the wine we were interested in, an AZ blend, to sample before committing to a whole bottle. We proceeded to suck down the said bottle, without much further ado.  The menu has a lot of options - and that's coming from a vegetarian with a fungus-phobia. I've had something different every time I've gone, and each has been so very tasty. My favorite is the tofu and brown rice - simple, yet flavorful, and generously portioned, allowing for lunchtime leftovers. My companion got some pasta thing with ahi, maybe? Come on, I was drunk. But he seemed to like it just fine.  So, is True Foods just slightly self-righteous with its sparkly clean offerings and slick decor? Well, OK. Maybe. If you can get past this and the crappy parking situation, you are gold. Your liver might thank you for the healthy meal, but you can go ahead and shush it up with one or four of their signature cocktails. Tons of yum! I will be back.

I'm bummed about all the poopy reviews of this place. Granted, we went on a rainy Sunday night, so the place was dead, but no complaints about the food or service. In fact, the pizza is awesome -- reminds me of Tuchetti's (R.I.P.) yummy thin crust/flatbread creation. The bruschetta consisted of big chunks of green and kalamata olives and fresh bread, not some crappy olive tampenade. Seriously delicious. The decor, as others have mentioned, is killer - so interesting and different. The upstairs, with its fun house of mirrors, is potentially confusing if you're shitfaced, but oh well. The bathrooms are unmarked and unisex and I did hear one of my female companions squealing about poop in one, but again, oh well.   I will definitely go here again, although I agree in that it's not exactly cheap -- save your binge drinking for the Bikini.

This is the place that took my tart fro-yo virginity, and despite my falling head over heels for it, I never wrote a review because I couldn't remember the stupid name of the place. I paid attention today.  Well, if you've been to one of these self-serve yogurt places, you've been to them all. This place is nothing incredibly delicious or horrifyingly atrocious compared to the others. I like it as it's next to my ghetto nail salon.   Four stars under normal circumstances, but today they get the coveted fifth because they have PUMPKIN!!! And oh...em... gee... it was delicious, complex and spicy like a silky cold pumpkin pie. Throw a little graham cracker crumbs on top and you're gold.

Random, but why is this HP so very very much better than its original Scottsdale counterpart? I have no idea, but the service is better and the food is better. The antipasto platter is delicious in its simplicity: slices of fresh bread, some weird salami stuff I can't pronounce, marinated grape tomatoes with basil, chunks of Parm and Cheddar cheeses, a small bowl of big weird spicy olives. That puppy didn't last five minutes at our table.  The pizza? Surprisingly good, crispy and coated with corn meal on its underbelly, bursting with fresh goat cheese and roasted red peppers on top. A tip for those of you who find the usually flaccid crusts associated with wood-fired pizzas distasteful: get it well done. Crispy and delicious.  The dessert? Oh sweet dear God in heaven. HP has its own version of a "Pizzookie", which is a half-baked cookie in a pizza-esque tin with ice cream on top, not some weird porn trick or Jersey Shore freak show. This is the single most perfect version of the Pizzookie on the planet: barely baked, hot melty chocolate chip cookie dough, hidden under three scoops of vanilla ice cream. The cookie dough is all hot and gooey and the juxtaposition against the frosty ice cream is just divine. Seriously, my mouth is watering even thinking about it. Yeah.  And perhaps HP's most incredible accomplishment of all: my SO, my father, and myself -- perhaps the three individually and collectively most picky, bitchy, and nitpicky people on the planet -- are ALL. HAPPY. THERE. Sold! We will be back, again and again.

Our visit certainly didn't start off well, standing ignored in the entryway until I literally flagged down a server to ask if we seat ourselves or what. We then escorted ourselves to a corner table where we sat ignored for over five minutes, to the point of deliberating leaving. But hell, we were hungry. Damn hungry. A frazzled server finally responded to my SO's desperate arm-waving tactics. I'm still not certain why she was frazzled - the place was reasonably busy, but not even full, and there was tons of staff wandering around.   One sip of the freshly juiced OJ and my SO was sold. It was delicious, fresh and velvety. The menu is basic, and the prices average. I ended up with four-cheese quiche and toast, my SO with bacon, eggs, and blueberry pancakes. The quiche was fluffy and cheesy at once, its texture a little odd but somewhat addictive. The wheat toast was light yet hearty and fatty here sucked down all of it. My SO's bacon looked quite lovely, and he concurred - delicious - and he was over the moon about the pancakes. The coffee was surprisingly good, not requiring three Splendas. tons of cream, and an ice cube to make it edible.   After we pretty much licked every crumb from the table, my SO went to the bathroom to beautify. The server stopped by and said, "You two are so cute and smiley, so not Scottsdale," in a sad, wistful way. "Nope," I replied, "we're from Phoenix". Poor thing. I tipped her extra for having to deal with snotty Scottsdale pricks all the time.  Downtrodden servers and questionable service aside, the food was delicious and I can bet we'll be back whenever we're back in the land of the cougars and $30K millionaires.

I almost hesitate to write an honest review about this place, lest the cat further escape from the bag.   The mani-pedi here beats the hell out of the one I had at the Camelback. No lie. They definitely spend an extra amount of time on the massage, even when they're busy. And the mani includes an extended neck and shoulder massage. My God. Heaven. Are they a few dollars more? I guess. I'm not sure, and I don't care.  Minus 1/4 star because even though it's heavenly, it's somewhat unsettling to be rubbed into oblivion by a smiling Vietnamese woman who keeps asking "You like? Feel good?", as it makes me feel a little pervy. Or maybe that's in my mind. I kind of like it either way. Minus 1/4 star because the services here do take a lot longer. This is not a quick stop you make while running errands on a Saturday. 1/2 star added back because of its proximity to AJ's, so you can get a giant iced coffee beforehand. If I could give an extra half star for nice facilities, sparkling cleanliness, and better-than-average English skills, I would.  Now go, let them rub you, and try not to think about where those hands have been.

As much as I like the service here, it's the unabashed lies and endless waiting amid gaggles of shrilly giggling Xavier girls that has chapped my ass to the point where I'm done with this place. They have a handy trick of popping you in the pedicure throne with your feet in the water without telling you how long the wait is, and by the time you've realized it's going to be forty minutes' wait, it seems like more of a hassle to get up and dry your feet. Clever me started asking how long the wait was as soon as I walked through the door, at which point someone inevitably looks around and lies through their teeth when they say "10 or 15 minutes". Multiply that by three and maybe you get the truth. Once I even made an appointment, trying to avert frustration, but my payoff was that I "only" waited 20 minutes. C'mon, people, it's plain old rude to lie, so as much as I love the neck and shoulder massages, I'm done...

After an unfortunate go-round with another shoe repair shop left me out $15 and with still-slippery heels (please reference http://www.yelp.com/biz/colonnade-shoe-shop-and-repair-phoenix#hrid:6-s_6CEptI5hsNspo_2tTg/src:self), I brought the culprits to Tony's Shoe Repair based on a recommendation from the Holiest Shoe Mecca on planet Earth, Nordstrom's. The guy at Tony's looked a little skeptical whilst I lamented the treacherous nature of the heels themselves, but he agreed to replace the heel tips with a different material without a single argument. Oh, and it took under an hour. Oh, and it was under $10. The next time I braved the skating-rink slick floors at work, the heels did not slip a single time. Woo!   More recently, upon deciding to dye a pair of suede boots, I visited Tony's once again to ask for advice. Once again, the guy looked skeptical (perhaps that's just his resting face?) but suggested a product that would do the trick. $7.50 later, I've got sweet black boots. Thanks, dude!

Hmmm.  PastaBAR struck me as oddly pretentious, filling its wine list with choices unrecognizable to the average person and batting about completely foreign Italian phrases on the menu. I'm not a total wine moron, yet I needed the server to translate for me. The safe-bet Syrah and Cabs were something ridiculous like $18 a glass. Huh? Luckily, the red I went with was perfectly tasty.   Vegetarians? You are shit out of luck here. I'm not even certain what a vegan would do. The only really vegetarian items on the menu were two noodles and butter dishes, which sounds as interesting as baby food. The twelve-ingredient streetwalker's pantry dish has anchovies in it, but since its description didn't put me to sleep, I gave it a shot, dead fish and all. The mix of textures with the pasta, sauce, and toasted bread crumbs was good, but the overall flavor simply didn't wow me. And, perhaps I am mistaken, but there were little sweet bits of mystery substance in there also... raisins? That's just Trying Too Hard. My SO got the butter and pepper noodles, which did indeed taste like an entire container of black pepper was dumped in the sauce. Spicy, but really one-dimensional.  He liked it very much, but he tends to choose pure heat over complexity in flavors.  The restaurant itself is cute but nothing extraordinary. The server was helpful, but slightly on the used-car-salesman side. Bread and butter, like someone else mentioned, does cost extra. WTF is that? The bread was good, but nothing special. Somehow, I kind of resent the idea of pasta dishes without pricey shrimp or fancy meats being expensive. It's frigging PASTA. I don't care if you make it in house. I just feel ripped off.

The first warning sign should have been the fact that this place was practically dead at 9 pm on a Saturday night. From previous Yelpers, I was prepared for the complete and total lack of authenticity for a so-called Irish pub... but I was not prepared for cold food and having to constantly fend off the drunk and/or homeless people who unabashedly walk right up to the table and brazenly harass you or ask for your leftovers. Some may find this kitschy. I do not.   Really, this place deserves less than one star. It gets a quarter-star for our poor server, who seemed sweet and somewhat embarrassed about the goings-on. It gets another quarter-star for the seasoned waffle fries, which were probably totally delicious when they were hot.  Bleh.

For your standard corner nail shop, this place raises a few notches above the rest. It's clean, efficient, and fast, always fully staffed -- I rarely wait, even on a busy weekend day. As Gabi said, the pedicure add-ons are clearly outlined in a menu format, where you know exactly what you're getting and how much it costs (thus eliminating the stealth $5 salt scrub). No surprises -- good or bad -- here. And that's a good thing.

Okay. They remodeled the place and possibly changed management. The décor is more modern, okay, fine. The new headmaster pimp (the one guy who basically lords over all the employees) is a bastard. He bitched out my manicurist for adding on a mani after my pedi, and she actually looked scared, as did some of the other workers. It was hostile and uncomfortable... not what I consider a relaxing experience.

Despite the cheesy, 80s-hair-band name, Rust and Roses is actually a pretty rad place. It's definitely heavy on the French shabby chic -- think chippy white painted scrolly wood pieces. There are some hidden gems throughout that are more up my alley, though, such as rusted old gym storage baskets and vintage lab style stools. I was able to pick up a few pieces for my new industrial-punk-rock-meets-log-cabin pad for just a few bucks. My main complaint is that the hours sort of suck for people with normal jobs (close at 5 pm weekdays), so it limits apres-work impulse shopping... but definitely a place I will add to my list for Saturdays.

Maybe the Postino's hysteria is dying down a little bit, because my SO and I were able to get a seat on the chic patio on a gorgeous Saturday night without effort. My SO was happy because he was able to sit and admire his new/old ride while we ate, with a Chimay in hand, and I got to drool over the modern/industrial decor.   We chowed our way through a bowl of olives, the Pub Board, an array of bruschetta, the salted sundae, and an affogato with great enthusiasm. The Pub Board has thick portions of warm pretzel bread which was to die for (although the mustard side was a little too small), along with chunks of earthy white Cheddar, some funky chunky sausage thing, and Corn Nuts (?). The bruschetta really needs no further commentary -- everyone knows the selection is excellent. I thought the bread could have used further toasting to give it some more backbone, and the fig spread was overpoweringly sweet to where it overwhelmed the otherwise delicate flavors of the green apple and brie. The salted caramel sundae was a little orgasm in a bowl (although again with the Corn Nuts? Jesus) and the affogato excellent, both standing on strong foundations of a high-quality vanilla ice cream bursting with flavor.   The drawbacks? Somewhat confusing bathrooms that my SO complained bitterly about (I love them, though) and people who think a bar is a good place to bring children on a Saturday night, especially when said children run amok over the patio, blowing out candles. It's a BAR, people, no matter what language is used to gussy it up.   Overall, a good experience in a wonderful little gem that has helped make Central a fucking cool little place. Yay, Postino!

If you thought dinner at Postino's was tasty, get your ass there for brunch. I cheated heavy on my vegetarian diet with the i-n-c-r-e-d-i-b-l-e "B.E.L.T", a panini-style sandwich bursting forth with eggs, thick slices of tomato, fresh spring mix, and perfectly cooked, amazingly flavorful bacon. The berry french toast, sprinkled with almonds and drizzled with some vanilla-y goo, also lived up to our lofty expectations. The apricot scone, which was thoughtfully served warm with a side of perfectly softened butter and apricot preserves, was very tasty, but not quite perfection. As a self-admitted snotty scone connoisseur, the texture was not quite up to snuff although the flavor was quite nice. The mimosas were delish, although really, how does one really fuck up a mimosa?  An extra half star for our brunch server, who either eavesdrops like a mofo or reads lips on the side, as he managed to congratulate my still-dizzy SO on his graduation from his MBA program (which had occurred approximately two hours prior!). Or did the shirt and tie on a Saturday morning give it away? Either way, my SO was dumbfounded and flattered at once. Nice touch!

Some people think if you have already experienced a trend, you're too old for it when it comes around again. Pffft! Bell bottoms, pink hair, Doc Martens, flannel shirts: I did it once, and if I like it, I'll do it again.   That said, I am old enough to have lived through the Wheat Germ No Saturated Fat Frozen Yogurt craze of the early 1990s. Even I was grateful as yogurt's slow demise was hastened by the $5 Cup of Coffee Phenomenon. I have thoroughly enjoyed the Cupcake Craze of recent years, and even dabbled in Chai Tea during its attempted revolt. I'm not discriminating. Every trend gets a turn.  So when I saw that Pinkberry was making all of Southern California moist in anticipation, I knew frozen yogurt was making a triumphant return to mainstream America. Accordingly, not unlike chlamydia at ASU, knockoffs began to appear on every corner, christened with stupid names following the current trend of tweaking words to make them "cute", a la "recessionista" and "staycation".   Lest we simply repeat TCBY, it's got a twist: the self-serve concept. Ingenious. Keeps your staffing costs down, encourages total consumer narcissism, and gives the opportunity to make serious bank. Brilliant!  For the most part, I love it. I adore the tart flavors, with fresh juicy strawberries and almond slivers. Healthy, quick, fresh, the perfect lunch. Because I am not a) a pig or b) a dumbass, I exercise portion control and get the perfect amount for $3.50. After dinner, I can get a dessert I feel good about, while my SO can go to Haagen-Daaz and suck down two giant scoops of ice cream while he complains that his boobs are getting bigger.  However... any time you introduce the self-serve concept into food, you're going to get people who act like they haven't eaten in five years and/or have never actually seen a variety of toppings before. Mass confusion combined with gluttony is never a good thing. And, hey, moms out there? When the line is out the door, it's not a good time to let Junior act like he's a big boy by putting on his own toppings. Plus, kids are filthy little creatures; my only consolation is that it is highly unlikely that pediatric hands have ever touched the fresh fruit serving spoons.  So yes. I love it. It's delicious. I just try to avoid going at peak hours lest I lose it and shove the face of the slowpoke in front of me directly into a bowl of M&Ms.

Squee!!! So stoked. After years, yes, years, of stalking this Cartier necklace, I snapped and had a massive impulse control issue that resulted in my purchasing not only the pendant but a bad ass chain to go along with it. It's gorgeous and timeless, like all Cartier. LOVE. Yes, the shit is expensive and probably carries a horrendous markup for the name, but the designs are lovely and the materials top of the line.  I have to politely disagree with Heather regarding this Cartier location. While we are not exactly high rollers, at least in Cartier terms, my SO and I are always treated in a genuinely friendly manner every time we go. You'd think the visible tattoos and flip flops might give them hesitation, but no. Every sales person I have had the pleasure of working with has been kind and welcoming. Last night we all passed around our cell phones, showing off pictures of our cats. Totally the opposite of snotty. You're not going to get that at Tiffany's, people!

Cartier may be the last company on the planet to actually make an effort to show that they appreciate their customers. Mere days after I opened a so-called Red Card (their house credit card), I received a humongous package by FedEx containing a very kind thank you note and a lavishly packaged set of Cartier stationary. It may have cost the company far less than a hundred bucks to do this, but the effort speaks volumes -- they create a customer for life. Thanks, Cartier -- I wish more businesses took the time and effort to show their customers some appreciation.

These DIY yogurt places are all the same to me, with their stained concrete floors, modern (read: Ikea) decor, and eardrum busting music at frankly intolerable levels. This one was clean, big, and cheap. For $2.40, I thoroughly enjoyed my standard (plain tart + strawberries + almonds) with a little squirt of coconut on the side. It was like slurping down creamy Hawaiian Tropic -- yummy at first, but cloyingly sweet and one-dimensional soon thereafter. I'll stick to my tart varieties.

Yup. It's a DIY drive through car wash. It's fast, relatively cheap, and  centrally located. It's the little details that make this place shine -- such as the big Armor-all wipe thing you get when you pay, so you can scrub all the dried spilled coffee and dust off your console as you're cruising through the tube. The vacuums are hard-core, professional quality.  There is a 3-day guarantee on all but the cheapo $4.99 wash, where you bring the receipt in and get a free basic wash. One employee once told me, "We don't have any record of what car got the first wash, so you can really bring any car back for the freebie, you know" nudge, nudge, wink, wink. Well... that's not really my cup of tea, but thanks (?).   My main beef is that where's my effing punch card??? I never got one, and I've already been there three or four times. Dammit!!!

Holy. Over. Priced.  I stopped by to get a little bag of silly candy for a friend's birthday. I ended up throwing in a goofy post-it note pad, but holy crap, $45!? I almost passed out.  Don't think I'll be back...

This Yogurtland is so so so much better than the one on Rural and the 202, despite its shitty parking, frightening proximity to the soft porn whorehouse American Apparel, and totally disinterested staff. A-MAZ-ING. Maybe it was the tart blueberry that did me in. The product just seemed fresher and of higher quality here.  My only beef is minor: tip jars? Really? For doing absolutely nothing? No.

My stupid condo complex has, count 'em, ONE washing machine and ONE dryer for sixteen units. Awesome. So when I have a lot of laundry to do, including rugs, bedspreads, and towels, it's off to the *shudder* laundromat. I have many supremely ghetto options in my neck of the woods (central Phoenix), but I voluntarily drive all the way to Tempe to Eco Laundry.   This recently renovated laundromat is surprisingly not ghetto, for a laundromat. You still have your random screaming children with their equally poorly behaved parents, but the place is open, spacious, airy, and sparkling clean. The decor is sleekly IKEA-esque, with clean concrete floors. The staff is super friendly and helpful, and it's pretty mellow and quiet (again, minus the stray stupid kid). Since everything is new, *all* the machines actually - wait for it - FUNCTION. The prices are comparable other facilities, $1.25 for a small washing machine, $2.25 for the 2-loaders, $3.25 for the 3-loaders... and it goes up to 6-load capacity machines. Oh yeah, and free wi-fi! And free coffee! Very nice touches.  They also have laundry services here, where you drop it off and the staff does it for you. Since I am a laundry control freak, I have not partaken in this service and can't vouch for its value, but it's nice to know it's available.

Cute! I love another independent coffee shop in my neck of the woods. The people working there were friendly, but not ingratiatingly so. The menu and prices - on par with other coffee shops. I had to try something to eat, but none of the baked goods had mad shelf appeal. I went for the cardamom coffee cake, which looked about as exciting as burnt white toast. Appearances are deceiving! A sweet, milky vanilla-caramel cake with a thick ribbon of dense, concentrated cinnamon based spice running throughout, all with a thin and barely perceptible glaze on top. Yum yum yum! A little greasy and so definitely not on my every day meal plan, but this will serve nicely for a treat every now and again.   The coffee is average, but I'm no coffee snob. (I am baffled by those who suggest the barista should "learn to pull a good shot". WTF?) It's not Starbucks-burnt, so it works for me.   The girl working there (I assume one of the owners) said Fox 10 News was out there yesterday morning, doing a remote report. Cool! I hope it brings them lots of business. It's a good location, in a little strip mall that also has an Aveda salon (who knew?), and just a little out of my way in the mornings. Oh yeah, and they were actually open when I got there a little after 6:30. What's up with coffee shops that don't open until 7 (or later!!!)? I will definitely be adding Urban Beans to my list of morning coffee sources.

I've been going to Pita Jungle since it was a twee, one-room hovel on Apache, back when we had to walk uphill in the snow with no shoes for eight miles and shit. Seriously, I'm a long-time devotee. Back when I worked at that Planned Parenthood next door, it was 1000 Beans for lunch... every day. (Many apologies to my former co-workers and patients.)  So I've watched the gradual growth of PJ with some interest. Who doesn't want to see a locally-owned business thrive? When I saw the latest installment of the Great PJ Takeover occur in the form of a food court presence at Fashion Square, however, I have to admit I was somewhat befuddled. The dirty dreadlock crowd, attempting to permeate the premium-gas-only-SUV Louis Vuitton crowd? Doesn't this shit only happen in the movies?  I've been to this location twice now, both times out of desperation - staunch refusal to eat excrement from Panda Express versus inability to maintain attention span long enough to wait in line at Paradise. I had a falafel salad that was just covered in the most rank and odiferous onions known to mankind. My second visit, I wised up and got the falafel sandwich-no-onions, which was wrapped in a half-reheated and totally dried out pita and covered in said devil onions. Now, mind you, lunch and a pop there will easily put you out $10. That's too much money to leave unsatisfied, with roaring heartburn and breath that would singe Satan's chest hair off.  Plus, the people taking orders are impatient and a little snotty. Sorry if you've run out of patience trying to explain falafel to Middle America. Please don't take it out on everyone else.  Three times may be a charm, but I don't think I'll be back to this location...

Formerly the Dermatology, Vein, and Laser Institute, this cozy little office now falls under the umbrella of "West Dermatology". Well, even if the practice was gobbled up by a larger conglomerate, it hasn't lost any of its  charm. I've been going here for 10 solid years, getting this icky thing popped, that icky thing lasered off, and that lumpy bump cut out. Jason Arnett, a physician assistant, is hilarious and gets a great deal of sick pleasure out of aggressive pimple popping. Plus, he's never booked out for four months like your average M.D. (but just as experienced and knowledgeable).   The office could, admittedly, use a face-lift, no pun intended. However, we don't go to the dermatologist for the scenery, do we? I would go see Jason if he practiced out of a cardboard box in the parking lot. And that's coming from me, who is exceedingly picky, and a physician myself. I would recommend this practice to anyone!

I've been to Anthem more since this store opened than I have since the entire outlet mall opened. The sales are just sick -- once in a while, the entire store is 40% off. If you sign up for the emails, they send all kinds of crazy coupons. The clothes, admittedly, aren't as nice as the regular BR, but the overall flavor is very similar for a tiny fraction of the price. Last weekend, I got a pair of work dress pants, two chiffon tie-neck tops, a very expensive looking cowl neck top, and a button down shirt for my SO -- for about $115. That's insane!

The finds to be had at the J Crew outlet are great, but the main downfall is that the regular prices here really aren't some smokin' deal. The quality of the merchandise isn't that far below that of the regular store, which is a pleasant surprise, and there is some overstock of first-quality stuff.   The real steals are on the sale rack, especially when there's an extra 20 or 30% off the sale price. I've gotten some very nice, super cute tops for something like $12. Dress pants run around $60-70, which seems steep until you remember that the regular J. Crew pants are twice that.   Also be sure to check out the belts, jewelry, and hair accessories -- more hidden gems there. The men's department ain't too shabby either.

Giant Coffee's menu is not exactly giant. It's actually sort of sparse. Much of the wording on said menu is heavily littered with predictable buzzwords such as "fair trade", "organic", "recycled", which kind of never fails to annoy me. While I was standing there contemplating said menu, the air conditioning was blasting so hard I got goose bumps. Then I turned to contemplate the expansive space and saw the humongous front windows/doors were WIDE. OPEN. Yes. Wide open, spilling all the air conditioning out.  Huh?  Instantaneous loss of credibility.   Yeah. So that said, the cash only deal is a bummer. Does anyone under 50 carry cash anymore? Total pain in the ass. If I have nine dollars on me, I don't to spend it all on overpriced coffee. The coffee itself is okay, very strong and a little burnt, as seems to be the trend in recent years. I could make it palatable with a lot of cream and some funky all-natural organic free trade green sugar-free alternative. It was definitely way too strong for my SO, who made a bit of a sphincter face with his first sip.  The pastries are from Tammie Coe -- tasty, yes, but nothing you can't get elsewhere.  The space IS gorgeous, don't get me wrong, and it's my favorite part of this shop. Disappointingly, the bathrooms are really average. Usually spiffy places like this have bomb ass bathrooms. The attached Bunky Boutique is super cute, and it deserves its own review.  So yeah. Verdict? Too many other places to get coffee in this area... especially ones that open before 7 am, when I'm usually pounding the streets, desperate for caffeine. Time will tell how GC pans out...

A-mazing. Before the arrival of this most conveniently placed Total Wine, the only place to get unusual booze in CenPho was A.J.'s... and be prepared to shell out big buckaroos for that fancy-pants shiz. If you wanted cheap and copious, you had to make the haul to a BevMo somewhere in the 'burbs.   Total Wine -- well, its name alone is a bit of a misnomer. Yes, there are aisles and aisles of wine... but there is also a humongous beer section. But really? The most important thing is the liquor. Rows and rows and aisles and aisles of every flavor of every brand in every size. All at a VERY competitive price point. No stupid member cards. All just rock bottom prices on whatever your little heart desires. Bless them.

Tick, tock, tick, tock...   The sound of the countdown till the inevitable closure of this pretentious shithole. Don't get me wrong: I'm not going to write a review lambasting the evils of a $400 made-in-China t-shirt. For a girl as into gross consumerism as I, one would think Barney's would represent the ultimate altar at which to worship.  That said, I still work hard to earn every damn penny, and still expect a certain level of service at this price point. I will tell you that the customer service at my ghetto Target is heads and shoulders superior to that of Barney's. I have walked in with photos of an item, knowing they carry the designer, and asked them to find it for me. They take my number and email and smile and nod, but then........... crickets. I attempt to return a defective handbag (GASP!) past the sacred 30-day window in which returns are accepted. Much hemming and hawing and excuses and the bag is surrendered, mysteriously sans refund, with promises of a call from the manager. Again............. crickets. I have to stalk the handbag department to see how the Queen Manager has deigned to handle my quandary (for those dying to know, they sent the bag back to the manufacturer for repair without telling me). I walk through the shoe department, clearly lingering over a certain item, and.............. crickets. I can see a sullen young man with waxed eyebrows giving me the side eye from the back room, but............ crickets. Is it me? It's not Foot Locker, for fuck's sake. I'm not going to wave the shoe at him from across the room and holler out my size. Sorry. I'm not sure why the staff goes MIA. I'm certain that gossiping and doing each other's makeup does not take up a disproportionate chunk of their workday. I'm not 18 (read: will not make you bring out every shoe for me to try on for fun) and I'm carrying the same bag you're selling 20 feet away (read: have AMEX/will shop), so I'm not really sure what else I need to do to get some damn help.  Additionally, against my better judgement, I also sent my poor SO here to have all his suits and grown-up stuff altered when he lost weight and decided he wanted to pretend he was a J. Crew model. I figured the average tailor was not going to be on the cutting edge (heh) of this season's suit cut, but surely of-the-moment Barney's tailor would! Sadly, the seamstress, while perfectly friendly and competent, had just as many challenges with English and as little knowledge of trends as the $10-hem-while-you-wait place on the corner. The only difference was that the changing room was fancier -- she still needed an excess amount of direction, when we came to her hoping she would have the expertise to run the show.   Sorry, Barney's. I realize you carry a lot of niche labels and items not otherwise available in retail locations in this state. In the golden age of the Interwebs, though, your benefit of exclusivity is gone. Now who wants to place bets on what store will fill their empty space!?

I am the first one to admit I am completely obsessive. When I get fixated on something, I will fret and research and scout around until I find it, ideally at the lowest price possible; half-assed substitutions not permitted. But usually these obsessions are relatively minor, you know, like the perfect vintage Chanel bag or something.   So imagine my SO's dismay when I first went to Lux's new location and came home over the moon about a couch. Not just ANY couch: a midcentury semi-circular loungey tufted piece covered in butterscotch pleather that just screamed SWANK. Serendipitously, our 7-year old Ikea couch was nearing its expiration date. GAME ON.  I turned the interwebs upside down looking for something similar. I learned there are lots of really ugly round couches, and lots of Miami Vice-flavored "modern" pieces, usually resplendent in white leather. I made my SO go back to Lux two more times, once for spy photos of the couch for more details, and once to ask the owner if they wanted to sell it. (No.) I scoured eBay, Craigslist, Etsy, and chi-chi modern furniture sites like a frantic squirrel. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. I eventually learned the couch came from Red, and with baited breath I contacted them, knowing full well that the pieces they deal with are exceptional in quality and price.   Well, the day they told me said couch cost almost as much as the down payment on my house was a very, very dark day. Don't think there wasn't a lost hour of me wondering what I could sell and what I could skimp on to make it work. Thank God reality set in. The second that couch came home, one of the cats would inevitably jump right on it and projectile vomit a big fat hairball all over it, just like the little bastards did to the fancy Restoration Hardware duvet cover within 30 minutes of it being placed on the bed. THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS.  I was still licking my wounds from the Red incident, morosely scrolling through Craigslist, when the skies parted and glitter-farting unicorns came flying down. There she was, covered in stained cream and beige nubby fabric and lumpy pillows. My semicircular goddess. She needed a face lift, but her potential shined through. To whom could I trust her makeover?  Leonardo at UFO was recommended by virtually everyone I spoke with, and he seemed up for the challenge, despite the frantic Crazy White Girl vibes I was emanating while explaining my obsession with the Lux couch. Thankfully Leonardo read my neurosis loud and clear. He checked in with me through the whole process, handling me perfectly with kid gloves. He brought his staff to Lux to see the piece and took photos as to recreate it as closely as possible. Mind you, I am no upholsterer, but technically this had to be ridiculously challenging -- the curves, the blind tufts, the angles of the tufts, the removal of the arms and part of the back. The quality of the workmanship on the finished piece is incredible, and somehow they managed to turn it around in about three weeks. Just amazing. Was it pricey? Well, define pricey. After house-down-payment-pricey, car-down-payment-pricey ain't nothin'. And you get what you pay for.  Perhaps the most pleasant surprise of the whole process was Leonardo's shared enthusiasm for the project. He truly thrives on what he does and he radiates that positive energy as a result. He was truly a pleasure to work with and I would not hesitate to recommend his services. Plus, you'll get to meet a really genuine and passionate person in the process! What are you waiting for???  In the meantime, we'll be chillaxing on our spectacular new showstopper! (Did I mention, they somehow made it magically ridiculously comfortable too? Go UFO!)

Solid three and a half stars, rounded up because I am feeling magnanimous today . Others have already waxed rhapsodic about the high points of this little hidden gem: the decor (slightly kitschy, somewhat modern and a pinch of rustic), the salsa bar (over ten types, freshly made and flavorful without the tastebud massacre of straight hot chilis), and the horchata (yummy and light, made unique with the addition of finely chopped cantaloupe and strawberries and a sprinkle of pecans).   Being a quesadilla fanatic, I got the veggie one. Now, mind you, I had not read any reviews prior to my visit, so I was somewhat disconcerted  by the three pound Mexican calzone that arrived. I'm not complaining -- it was quite tasty -- but the puffy, doughy corn "tortilla" exterior was a bit much for me. Oh yeah, and the five handfuls of cheese inside of it. Too much. The damn thing was so big, it eventually became three meals.  My SO, the ultimate Mexican food snob, dug his chicken burro, although it was overstuffed and gooing and oozing everywhere, requiring him to attempt to consume it with a (cheap, flimsy plastic) knife and fork. Try cutting a hot, goopy mess wrapped in a tortilla sitting on a single thin piece of paper on a wicker basket with bendy cheap utensils. Yeah. Total mess. Not first-date friendly.  The location, parking, and service are questionable, as others have noted. We beat the rush by going late morning; I didn't think the wait for the food was unreasonable, but I wouldn't be stopping in here for a bite if I was in a hurry.  While I loved the horchata, the fruit was chopped just finely enough to go shooting up the straw unexpectedly. Total choking hazard for the less physically coordinated (read: me).   Overall, pretty, pretty good. We'll be back, although I'll pass on the quesadilla next time...

Timo is the shit! My SO and I have followed him from his prior shop in Mesa (ugh) to his new shop, 5th Estate, in downtown Gilbert (double ugh). He is worth the drive to BFE, friends! If I recall, Timo apprenticed with Aaron Coleman... which undoubtedly nurtured his sinister streak, which manifests as decapitated severed demon heads (as evidenced by my SO's calf) and such. Don't sweat it, kittens, he also does pretty things too -- all solidly and professionally done. I believe his favorite style is traditional Japanese, but he rocks old-school Americana pretty damn well too. His prices are reasonable, he's gotten really fast, and, maybe most importantly, he's not a dick, a rarity in the tattoo world! Woo hoo!

The Jeep dealer has since moved to a larger location on FLW Blvd., just FYI. When I stopped by today to test drive the Liberty and the Grand Cherokee, the salesman treated us like he was half asleep and/or couldn't care less. He also implied that the $40K version of the souped-up Grand Cherokee was out of my price range and refused to discuss it further. Huh? What is that? Isn't that one of the top five rules of sales -- never prejudge your customer? Bye-bye. We went to Rover instead, where they treated us very well, and this is from someone who's driven Jeeps forever. Lame.

Words don't describe my love, devotion, and adoration for this odd little salon.   After some mullet-loving "stylist" screwed up my hair up like no one ever has (please reference my E's Urban Hair review), I reached full on H-bomb crisis mode. I was starting a new job in three weeks with a poorly done emo/dykey hairstyle with a horrific and eternally brassy blonde color that may or may not have made me cry on multiple occasions. After having made much raucous fun of hair extensions for many years, it was time to eat crow and lick the plate clean.   Fervent and frantic Internet searching led me to the Goddess Salon. It was a little odd initially; you call the central number, leave a message, someone gets back to you, it's all kind of weird and frankly sketchy. They invited me to stop by when they were working on a client so I could see the process and they could check out the disaster on my head. The facilities are small, intimate, and secluded. The clients seemed genuinely happy with their hair, and I believe they would have said that even if Maryam wasn't standing next to them, holding a scorching hot styling tool-cum-instrument of punishment.   I got a fairly quick once-over and an estimate for the whole shebang. I think I almost passed out, actually, but desperate times call for desperate measures. I had to wait an excruciating three or four weeks for the hair to get ordered and delivered, and then game on! The initial visit practically gave me diarrhea from anxiety (not alleviated by buckets of champagne), because I had the potential to leave looking a hell of a lot more foolish than I did coming in, and a lot poorer.  As Maryam haphazardly slapped darker dye all over my head I wondered what the hell I'd gotten myself into. I had worked myself into a full on migraine by the end of the 7 hour extravaganza, but when it was all said and done...  HOLY. SHIT.  Amazing.  This are not your average extensions with glue bonds. These are held in with non-damaging metal microbeads that crimp shut. These are real human hair (don't think about that part too much). These are the extensions that Jennifer Aniston or Jessica Simpson gets. Magically, somehow, Maryam's slapdash color job was perfect and matched the extensions flawlessly. After a brief styling learning curve, all the hair became easier to style and maintain than my own hair alone. I can wear it up, wear it down. Stellar. Gorgeous. NO regrets.  And I haven't even touched on Maryam, who is super hot, funny, and welcoming while at once wielding F-bombs in that amusing way only non-native English speakers can. Her brother - whose name escapes me - and Chelsea also have worked on me, and they are also pleasant and easy to talk to, without being fake (important when you spend hours and hours at a time with them!).   Like Annaliese said - I'd give them a 50 star review if I could. Yes, it's expensive. Yes, installation and maintenance is time-consuming. It's worth EVERY FREAKING PENNY. I promise you, from the bottom of my cold control freak heart.

My maiden voyage to RnR started off shaky; my SO and I almost turned around when we first opened the door because there was an annoying DJ who was just loud as hell. Who thinks this is a good idea for Sunday morning, when all the poor, the downtrodden, and the hungover venture out for breakfast? I thought the club closed at 2 am last night.  Despite the dance remixes of Bon Jovi and too-cool-for-you crowd predominantly in their early 20s, Grandma and Grandpa decided to stay and indulge in some sundried tomato and goat cheese scrambled eggs, Chambord French toast, coffee, and Bloody Marys. I fully admit that the strip of bacon shoved in the Bloody Mary is totally surprising and off-putting for a vegetarian, but it is certainly creative. The Bloody was tasty, but slightly bland and nothing special. The scrambled eggs and hash browns (well done, natch) were huge and delicious, with plenty of tender sun dried tomatoes, but I had to save room for French Toast Mountain.   Good thing I did, and it's a damn good thing Fatty wore her stretchy jeggings, because I slurped my half of the French toast down and practically licked the plate clean. It was, bar none, the best French toast I have EVER had. Stuffed with sweet cream cheese, drenched in boozy raspberry sauce, and crowned with great fluffy piles of fresh whipped cream, it was a flavorful little orgasm on a plate.   Despite the remix of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" (poor Kurt is SPINNING in his grave) and slightly questionable service (forgotten English muffin), we will be back -- but only on a day when we have nothing else to do but lay around the house, buzzed and in a lethal food coma.... just YUM.

Can I tell you how much I despised Fate with all its pretentious, snooty bullshit? I should have known the second I realized that Bliss/reBar was in the same building that it was probably tainted from all the leftover evil.  And so it is. We showed up and the restaurant was practically empty. There is no hostess or even a hint of one. We stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people? The place was dead.). We were told there was a 15 minute wait, or we could eat on the patio. Um, it's 40 degrees...  AND THE PLACE WAS DEAD. I guess we'll wait. We go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand. The server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour, but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes. That's sure inviting, isn't it.  So we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections. $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me, so I go with the veggie sandwich. That sounds innocuous enough, right? The food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered. Sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. My "veggie" sandwich arrives and it looks like a Filet-o-Fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. I couldn't help it - I asked the server what the hell it was.   Eggplant.  Ohhhhkay then.   It was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. Impossible. The pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding. Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.  So, while we are attempting to recover from this mess, the server goes MIA. You'd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there, we'd get a damn check. Nope. No. Nada. Had to chase someone down and ask for it. When it finally came, there wasn't even an itemized receipt, so even though the total seemed a little low I couldn't check it out. I was so over the whole experience at the point I didn't even care. I left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door, where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours.   Just UGH in every way.

Too many contractor types are straight up shysters. They're messy, they're rude, they're sketchy, they're sloppy, they're not thorough. Artie is none of the above. He gave me a free estimate on some work, which came in significantly less than a competitor (like almost 50% less). During the job, he was punctual and friendly, and didn't attempt to pad up the bill with miscellaneous shit. He offered pretty solid advice on other issues we were planning to deal with ourselves down the road, never once implying that we wouldn't be able do to it ourselves. Also turns out he's even more than a plumber - he does all kinds of stuff (drywall, tile, on and on and on). Good to know! At the end of the transaction, my painfully fastidious and critical father (who had been circulating about, eagle eyes peeled for shortcuts or mistakes) specifically asked for Artie's card, which is kind of like being nominated for an Emmy or something in Dad-land. Woo! Two thumbs up.

If you are a) in a hurry or b) claustrophobic, just turn around. Turn around now and RUN.   You will be sitting close enough to hear the wisdom of neighboring randoms in love with the sound of their own voice. (A favorite quote from the next table: "If you want to be CEO, you gotta get your MBA.")  You will wait. A long time. A disproportionately long time. Your server is super friendly and kind, but harried and unapologetic, even when shrimp end up in your dinner uninvited. ("Oh, oops, good thing you're not allergic to shellfish.......... are you?")  The wine and beer list? Meh. Abbreviated.  The menu? Bruschetta, salads, light sandwiches: your typical wine bar fare.  So why in the eff is the place so successful? Location, location, location. What would be average in Arcadia is novel and exciting in 85028. Really. There is nothing else like it in this part of the valley and for that it wins. Its patio is big, decor is cute, food is decent, and it is god damn chic and exciting if you are used to Applebee's.   So why does 32 SHEA garner four generous stars? BECAUSE THE NUTELLA MARTINI IS PROOF THAT GOD EXISTS. Pure. Genius.

My hair is so obnoxious, it made one stylist cry during an attempted blowout, and my current regular stylist swears that despite my Irish appearance I most certainly have some degree of African descent. Throw in extensions of different texture that need to blend in and you have one ridiculous head of hair to style.   I have finally mastered taming the Afro puff on my own, but after recent injury I was not up to the 45 minute arduous task which requires two strong arms, multiple products and styling tools, not to mention blood, sweat, and tears. Ah! Drybar, the answer to my vain prayers.  $35 for the shampoo, blowout, and style - you can't beat that with a stick. An appointment was easily booked online and off I went. The staff is super friendly and the decor is perfect - interesting, but not cluttered. There's cookies sitting around for a quick nosh or you can buy little bags of snacks. You are offered flavored water, champagne, whatever your pretty little heart desires. This month's magazines are everywhere and a big flat screen TV is playing a movie with subtitles.   I've had the same stylist, Jessica, two weeks in a row, and she is awesome. Friendly and chatty enough, but doesn't force conversation which is next to impossible anyway when a jet-engine blow dryer is roaring 4 four inches from your ear. Too many stylists don't get this - Jessica, you rock. The shampoo is awesome, relaxing in plush chairs with just a little scalp massage thrown in ($10 extra for 10 full minutes of rubby-rub heaven... maybe next time!). We picked a style from their little picture book and away we went, Jessica completely nonplussed by the frizzy/extension mess on my head. Both times, I've left with gorgeous and perfectly done hair resplendent with the delicious scent of Moroccanoil products. The first blowout lasted a full week so I expect the same this time around.   LOVE everything about this place: the concept, the execution, the style. Love the beverages, love the online appointment booking/confirmation/thank yous, love the ease of the entire process. The location in the Scottsdale Quarter is hideously inconvenient for me which is the only factor that would prevent me from going every single week for all perpetuity. I practically begged the owner/manager to consider opening a location in Phoenix - 40th St/Camelback, I'm looking at you. Pretty please.

Owning a home ensures that you will be forced to interact with a number of service providers -- cable, landscaper, A/C repairman, you name it. Most of those interactions are... frustrating. They're late, they're expensive, they don't address your concerns, they don't fix the problem.   Molly Maid is so the opposite of every single shitty thing I just said. They are set-your-watch-by-them prompt, they are thorough, they are polite, and they are reasonably priced. Also helpful: fluent English. Because we need Saturday service, our team is never made of the same two employees (they volunteer for overtime on Saturdays) -- but every single person we have met has been top notch and awesome. Two worker bees can leave our 2800 square foot place gleaming, shiny, and gorgeous in two and a half hours... for just $120. Considering it would take my SO and I four grueling, cussing hours to leave the house looking marginally clean, this is a smoking deal.   In a sea of questionable housecleaning service providers, you have found your beacon! So grateful for thorough and trustworthy Molly Maid.

Cats puke. I'm not disillusioned or unrealistic. Hairballs, food wolfed down too fast, bits of string or packing material that somehow looked appetizing. I'd nearly eliminated the hairball situation with these little nuggets I got on Amazon, but one of the cats kept puking just bile. Like, every other day. Often on the bed. He was otherwise fine, acting cute and stupid as normal, no weight loss. The vet said something about a protein sensitivity (?) and to try switching to one of those single ingredient foods. Oh, and it might take up to 6 weeks to see a change. If he's still having trouble, we sell this [exorbitantly expensive] partially pre-digested food. I dropped a chunk of change on fancy Blue Buffalo food from PetSmart and yet the vomiting continued.   Then one day, after a mani/pedi, my friend wanted to pop into this pet store to see if they carried her dog's food. For shits and giggles, I asked the guy working there about my situation. He said the cat was having trouble digesting the food and so adding digestive enzymes should make that easier and eliminate the puking. Given that the vet had suggested that pre-digested food (um, yuck), this made sense. Then the guy went on to say that pumpkin contains the enzymes in question. Just mix a little in their food, and you'll see a change in 3 days if that's the problem. I probably laughed at him, but bought a $3 can of their fancy organic pumpkin puree either way as well as a handful of cat toys from the bins. He threw in a ton of samples of single ingredient foods, which I thought was nice.   Two weeks later? The only puke around these parts is string or tinsel from one of the glittery toys I bought that day (ah, irony). Unbelievable! I went back and to Pet Planet and got all the food he recommended, as well as powdered digestive enzymes. The cats go apeshit over the food -- they love it more than anything I've ever bought at PetSmart. Awesome!!! I am so grateful for this place.

Kitschy name, cute concept, a little indie place in an area consumed by monolithic chains -- Oink really had all the potential in the world.   The space is simple, open, and clean, although very sparse --  what some may interpret as modern simply reeked of half-assedness to me. "Hey, let's throw some pink paint on one wall and call it a day!" The bathrooms had fancy schmancy modern sinks and fixtures, although the weekly cleaning form on the back of the door was, disconcertingly, completely blank.  The service was super average, better than I expected considering I had heard it was atrocious. My breakfast-loving SO and I did our usual, each of us getting our own separate egg things followed by a shared short stack of blueberry pancakes. My omelet was nice, steaming hot and full of nice fresh veggies. The home fries on the side, though, were cold. The English muffin was barely toasted, also cold, and so slathered in butter it was slippery. My SO inhaled most of his Hollandaise-slathered Benedict, but let's face it, he'd slurp down a dog turd if it was drenched in Hollandaise. The pancakes were completely and utterly unremarkable, as was the OJ (watery and bitter) and coffee.   The sucker punch was the bill: with tip, over $40 for two for breakfast. If I wanted to shell out $40 for breakfast, I would stay in my own hood and go to Taylor's where I know the food will be spectacular and the service top-notch. Alternatively, I could go to IHOP across the street, where I know the food will be reliably above average for half the price.  Sorry, Oink, your prices make you little piggies. You've gotta step up your game, because no one wants to pay Paradise Valley prices for a Glendale experience.

Nom nom nom nom nom nom. I am five pounds heavier after only two days' worth of unfettered access to the gastronomic orgiastic delights Bellagio's little "coffee shop" has to offer. Tiramisu gelato, resplendent with chunky mouthfuls of espresso-soaked sponge cake? Check. Nutella brioche, bursting with creamy hazelnut-chocolate flavor? Check. Scrumptious plain coffee, made luxurious with gobs of caramel syrup and real whipped cream? Check. Peanut brittle gelato, which may have finally converted my gelato-ly skeptical SO to the dark side? Check. Fresh fruit cup, with juicy blueberries the size of your thumb? Check. Breakfast panini that made my SO's eyes roll back in his head from pleasure? Check.  Okay. So I spent well over $100 there in 48 hours. Shut up. Everything I had the pleasure of ingesting was superb! The world's largest chocolate fountain (which would look soooo much better in my living room) attracts a bunch of annoying tourists with cameras, but if you can focus on the goods and get past the chaos, you are gold!

Certain things in life are bound to be addictive. Caffeine, chocolate, vodka, extensions. After a lifetime of crappy hair, I succumbed to the allure of extensions a few years ago. The learning curve was steep as I tried a few different salons. The price was exorbitant, the location inconvenient, appointments hard to get, the hair ratty, the technique iffy.   I am so happy to have found Katy. She is accessible, friendly, and flexible, and has great quality hair. She uses the little beads to crimp each little bundle of hair to your own hair -- no weird keratin goo, glue, wefts, tape, or bullshit. Plus, girlfriend is the Tazmanian Devil of stylists -- she hauls ASS, ensuring you will not lose 4+ hours of your life in her chair, and does a spot-on job every time (for a pretty reasonable price, from my experience). Knowing I am supporting a small family owned business is a nice bonus too. I can't recommend her enough, but be warned -- you can't get extensions "just once"!

Honey?  Can we talk?  Listen. I have to tell you something.  I'm pregnant.  With Steak 44's food baby.  Yes, I know I'm a vegetarian.  It's so wrong, it's right.  I've been side-eyeing this place since it and its greedy valet situation has pretty much rocked this entire corner. I do, however, appreciate the rotating display of ridiculous vehicles parked pretentiously out front and how they help me win the wintertime game of Luxury Car Bingo In The Desert. I'm shallow. It's okay.  My dad and I, feeling brave, actually put on non-denim pants and real shoes and ventured to Steak 44. We went early, sans reservation, fearing the crowds. We easily got seated in a big booth, ensconced by dividers, shielded from the abutting bustling kitchen by a glass wall so sparkling clean you could barely confirm its existence. No glass surface in my home has ever been or will be so spotless.   I started with the blood orange martini, probably the most I have ever paid for a single cocktail in my entire life. It was tasty in the way that Hawaiian Punch is tasty. I switched the to tart cherry martini, a wise move -- a complex and interesting drink with a heavy Luxardo cherry flavor. Meh or impressive, the martinis were big and accompanied by a hefty shaker filled with leftovers.  The hovering server, resplendent with some unidentifiable foreign accent, assured us the sides were enough to serve three to four. Because I was forgoing a pricey traditional entree, I picked a handful of veggie sides, while my dad opted for some medium rare 12 oz slab of moo. The roasted sweet potatoes and creamed spinach were okay, not knockouts, easily overshadowed by the glory of the creamed corn creme brûlée. I mean, incredible, amazing, custardy corn goodness. Just divine. The thin, curly, crispy onion strings were fluffy wisps of awesome, spilling over on the fancy white tablecloth. The veggie servings are massive and will easily feed me all weekend. My dad, who was all ready to hate the place, because it's all trendy and replaced his beloved Cork & Cleaver,  was forced to admit his steak was a perfectly cooked, excellent quality piece of meat. Out of principle, we split the butter cake, which was bizarre but good -- like a pound cake and cornbread had a baby. Not the high point of the meal, but good.   The service was excellent and almost over the top until the credit card slip was signed; then he was MIA. That's lame. The place is not cheap; it's best reserved for a special occasion. It seems to be drawing a big crowd now, but is it sustainable given the number of pricey steakhouses in the valley?   Time will tell; if 44 stays, I can eat my fill of corn creme brûlée whenever my whims see fit; if 44 goes, I get to park without circling the lot three times. All good; I win either way. Now, about that food baby -- it's due pretty soon.

A pub in a supermarket is bizarre, I know, but somehow it works. There we were on a Saturday evening, not starving, but looking for a little nosh and a couple drinks. I'd been wanting to try 20H since checking out the menu, so what the hell, it seemed perfect.  We plopped down at one of the low tables with a good view of the freezer aisle shenanigans and proceeded to devour a cheese plate and beer/cheese dip. OMG, excellent! The cheese plate could have used more fig preserves, and the cheese dip would have been better with soft (not toasted) pretzel bread, but we were pleasantly surprised at how delicious everything was. I tried the cucumber-lime wine cocktail and was not blown away, but we had a couple of excellent niche beers.   If this was a standalone pub, I'm not sure how I'd feel about it. But placed inside a high-end grocery store? The people watching is excellent and we had a glorious time making fun of excessive and inappropriate label scrutiny. We'll be back.

No. No. No, no, no, no.   I've been meaning to try this place for quite a while. The menu looked fun and any place with the word "bakery" in it already has brownie points (heh). We roll in on a Saturday around lunchtime and the first impression is totally meh. Nothing special about the space, and the set up is confusing with virtually nonexistent signage. Do you sit yourself? Are there servers? I see a counter, but no menu posted. Where do you order? No clue. We get in a line that was moving at glacial speed, which I guess is good as it gave us time to peruse the paper menus and ogle the baked goods. They brought out a fresh tray of salted caramel brownies while we were standing there, so foolish me thought we'd hit the jackpot, the holy trinity of carbs, fat, and sugar, fresh off the press.   I ask what the soup of the day is, and -- whoops! -- they're out of soup. Well, okay, grilled cheese with avocado and fries. My SO orders quiche, but -- whoops! -- they're out of that. He defaults to the meat loaf sandwich, and we ask about pop -- there's no fountain, and a cooler up front is practically empty. Well, that's all they got there in that little cooler: chocolate milk, coconut water, cucumber soda, root beer, and a couple of fruit sodas. All fully loaded -- no zero/low cal options, not even water. (Lest I sound like the world's fattest hypocrite, I will stuff my face but I don't drink my calories, unless they are alcohol. Period.) The employee is totally disinterested and unapologetic. We add one of those caramel brownies and before you know it, lunch is $35. For lunch!? Ohhhhh-kay. While we're ordering, an employee comes out from the kitchen through one of those swinging doors, and when the kitchen side is visible I catch a printed sign saying something like all employees using disposable cups for personal beverages will be charged $1 a cup. Fucking tacky. I hope I hallucinated it. Even if you're that much of an asshole to treat employees that way, I'd hope you'd have the sense to put the sign somewhere where customers might not see it.   We sit. And wait. And wait. And wait. It took well over half an hour for the food to come out. My sandwich and fries were stone cold. The slices of avocado were practically paper thin. The bread was dry and hard. The "meatloaf" sandwich got the same treatment, with the portion of meatloaf so thin my SO suggested that it might just be meat paste instead. His sandwich was full on burnt on one side. His fries were like one giant mass of fries all stuck together in a lump. His meal was pretty much inedible. I hoped the fresh brownie would maybe at least somewhat redeem the situation, but its edges were hard and even its middle was dry. The flavor was bland and I've made countless batches of brownies from Ghiardhelli mix that were 1000x better than these.   The experience would be completely maddening but let's face it, it crossed that line and is now just frankly absurd. I have NO IDEA how this place is in business. I don't know how it has any reviews above two stars. It's beyond "oh, they were having an off day". It's thievery. $35 for an inedible meal. No one acknowledged the fact it took half an hour to get the food, and apparently no one acknowledged the fact the food was cold and burnt -- they just sent it out anyway. Patently offensive. There are way too many other reliable and delicious lunch options in the area for that price, and even much less -- save your time and money.

Have you ever been at the club, feelin' fly in your shortest dress and sparkliest hooker glitter makeup, and been like, "dang! I could really go for pancakes right now"? But, if you went for pancakes, you'd lose your buzz and maybe your random hookup? No one should have to choose between getting drunk, being seen/getting laid, and pancakes. Thank the sweet baby Jesus for Eggstasy.   Housed in an innocuous appearing strip mall in Scottsdale, Eggstasy is truly like having breakfast in a nightclub. The "hostesses", who clearly look to the Kardashian family for fashion guidance, look at my handbag when I come in, not me. The space is pure Ikea, sparsely decorated, cheap and cheesy. While walking to your table, everybody is checking everybody else out hard and not trying to hide it. It is a goddamn fashion show -- stupid, but entertaining.  The coffee totally sucks and is barely edible -- super burnt and bitter. The servers are nice but overwhelmed; orders go in and come out wrong; empty cups go unfilled of shitty coffee. Twice in row, they've given us food that was ordered by mistake, saying "oh, just have it, don't worry about it". It is noisy; it isn't cheap. It is crowded; be prepared to wait.  So why the hell four stars, you're asking. One: The OJ is juiced on site and is incredible. Two: the whole wheat and berry pancakes, from the HEALTHY part of the menu, are literally the best fucking pancakes I've ever had. It must be the whole wheat, it gives them a little more heft and texture and allows them to get all perfectly crispy around the edges. Then they pile on mountains of fresh berries. I mean, really -- I am powerless. Three: It is way too much fun to play "let's traumatize the Scottsdalites" by showing up in pajamas and no makeup just to see the looks on their buffed and powdered faces. Four: the owners, a Greek family from Chicago, are always there, checking in and getting their hands dirty to help out. I love that. Plus, Greeks from Chicago? They make the world's most amazing food.  Lastly, the Bloody Marys look amazing. Is that chocolate covered bacon in there? If I hadn't already resigned myself to be so uncool as to admit to disliking day drinking, I would be all over that.

Three simple words: Pumpkin. Pie. Smoothie.  Now, before you dismiss me as just another wild-eyed white girl inexplicably obsessed with all things pumpkin, allow me to reassure you that I am not that girl. Pumpkin and coffee are a combination as appealing as blueberries and cat vomit. Just... no. I will never photograph, post, or tweet about anything involving a PSL, unless I am making fun of someone.   But pumpkin PIE? Let's talk. I had just finished returning an embarrassing stack of regrettable internet purchases to UPS when I saw the sign. First, a real live juice bar in my hood? On the way to work? Open when I drive by? No rush hour left hand turns required for ingress and egress? Boom. I hustled on in to be delighted by a nice big menu with juices, smoothies, acai bowls, and snacks. The green juices looked amazing but at this point I was like a dude in old town Scottsdale on Saturday night: on a Mission For Pie. I ordered one up from the marginally friendly girl behind the counter -- a little over five dolla. Not bad for a fancy ass smoothie. After the usual few minutes, the guy from the back (significantly friendlier than the girl) popped out with my glass of magic.   It's a good thing I waited till I was in the car until I tried it because it was like a LOL cat came to life as the NOM NOM NOM sounds reflexively escaped my body. I have no idea how they do it. It is spot on pumpkin pie, minus a buttery crust and animal-derived ingredients. Perfect rich pumpkin flavor, heavy on the spices, and super creamy. AH-mazing. I got to the very bottom and there was one last small solid nugget so I scooped it up. Banana. BANANA? That shit IS bananas because I seriously did not detect a banana flavor at all. This trickery just added to the wizardry mystique of this glass of magic.  I am super stoked to have this place so close to home and I look forward to sampling every stinking item on the menu.

I sit at a desk all day looking in a microscope, for many excruciating hours at a time. I have a crappy, cheesy, and extremely uncomfortable chair that was temporarily made tolerable by some cheap lumbar support thing I found at Staples. Well, that POS lasted only two or three months before the strap broke, leaving me high, dry, and achy.  Once again on the prowl for a way to ease my desk-driving pain, I remembered this little store next to AJ's, after finding no acceptable options at Tar-jay or Staples. Relax the Back had a somewhat mind-boggling array of lumbar supports, as well as a friendly freshly-scrubbed guy ready to help me pick one out. Five minutes later, I left with a very nice item -- nice and quick, no muss, no fuss. Fabulous!  I'm only taking one star off because the stuff is somewhat pricey, but  since the products actually work the way they're supposed to, it's worth it. Ahhh.....
