Drive about 30 mins to come here once a month or so. Love their honey hot wings. Yeah, the wings are pretty small but the sauce is the best. Better than natives honey hot sauce. The reason my girlfriend and I keep going back is for their cheese sticks. They're probably just frozen out of a bag but oh are they crispy and delish. Best cheese sticks in town. I'm not from the area so it is a little "ghetto" but we usually come here for lunch and it's never bad. Plus the guy working the front with glasses is nice and memorizes our order now. Will continue to support this little goodie shop, the only problem is the price of gas to get there.

I used to like this place for one reason. Ice cream. But service here is so horrible now. I can't comment on the food since we were never seated. The "hostess" was new and told us there were no tables available even though there were plenty of tables open. I asked why and she said those are all reserved for later...Hmm it was 6:45 and she said people had reservations for 6:30. That was the first issue. We've been here many times in the past, never with a reservation and this new hostess says they don't have a table for us. Then a server comes over and assures us we are not welcome there. Your job is to make customers feel welcomed, not kick them to the curb. Needless to say I will never come back. The only reason I've been going in the past was for their pistachio ice cream. All of the meat or chicken was always way too dry or undercooked. Rude service to say the least. They need to get rid of this horrible new staff and keep that help wanted sign on the window cause the staff they have now belongs at a walmart with their lack of hospitality. Go to Persian Room.

Love going here for busy movie openings. I can arrive 5 mins before my movie starts and my seat will be there waiting. Waiters bring you a bag of popcorn and drink and whatever else you want to order. Seats are very comfortable and recline. Also comes with a blanket because it does get cold. A little expensive, about double Harkins each ticket. But worth it to watch movies where you don't want to deal with packed theaters or annoying kids screaming.

Love their teriyaki everything. Used to be samurai sams and that was horrible. Yogis gives you a good amount of food with every order too. I always get a chicken bowl and gyoza. Love their rolls too. Best teriyaki sauce ever.

Do not go to this location. I've been going to the scottsdale and Shea location for years and the food and service there are just better in every way. Maybe a managerial thing? Let's start with probably the worst hostess I've ever dealt with at any restaurant. Went at almost 9pm still a little busy. She told us the wait was 15 mins but I saw at least 3 tables that just haven't been cleaned so I say we will wait. Then she points to 2 open bar stools and says you can sit there if ya want. No thanks. We wait 15 for the tables to get cleaned, and we go to the little middle section with probably 4 out of 6 booths open and she sits us at the tiny table with 2 little chairs? Um no we'll take a booth. She rolls her eyes throws the menus on the booth table and walks away. Just rude in my opinion. Your job is customer service. Wash dishes if you hate dealing with people. Been in the restaurant business for 20 years and would never hire someone like this. Service was good. Pizza had a giant burnt bubble but it wasn't bad. Meatballs were also good. Shrimp scampi had no taste though. Pizooki was good but that's hard to mess up. Take the 15 min drive to the better location on Shea.

The teenagers working here are not capable of handling any complaints. I asked for no onions on an Italian club and instead they put no sauce. I brought it back and all they said is we can pick off the onions for you.. No I don't want you digging through my sandwich with your hands. Just make me a new sandwich how I ordered it. Can't believe how bad their customer service is, the lady behind me ordered a club lulu and they gave her a club tuna and said that's what she ordered. The kids working here need to develop customer service skills or they need a manager here that actually cares about guest concerns. Neither of us got comped anything not even a soda. Instead all we got are eye rolls for something that was their fault. Maybe if they turned down their horrible music they could hear the orders correctly.

The filet was good but the salmon was better! Surprising for a steakhouse. Kind of pricey but will probably return in the future.
