Most legit mexican food I've ever ate. You know its good when your the only white person in there. Straight up authentic and everyone is very nice, including the chef who now knows me. Breakfast burritto has won "Best cure for a hangover" over last years winner "Pedialyte freeze pops". The only thing is a couple of times I've requested the God-like el pastor and received beef or non el pastor pork. Well worth the $3-5 bucks youll spend there!!!

This place was a life saver!! I needed a dresser, I found a dresser! and a really cool shelf for a completely affordable price. And by dresser I mean a dresser, goregous all wood (maple I believe) beautifully designed 9 drawer, brass handled dresser. The movers we're so helpful in loading it on the truck, everyone there nice and friendly. You can furnish a whole house in that store with the quality, pre-owned/sometimes new furniture they have at seriously unbeatable prices. What a great company. If you need something like a huge luxurious couch, beautiful kitchen table, chair, bed frame, nigh stand, coffee table, hutch, entertainment cabinet, lamp or armoire and you have a tight budget, look no further, get something worth the money- to hell with Ikea!

I love this place so hard.   V1 order the V1 why are you still reading this?!? you're mad!  seriously though, V1. get it.   Apparently they have the best pho in the state too. I don't like pho in general but I have gone to this place with at least 20 different people. All leave phofilled, both physically and mentally.   They are unbelievably consistent and never disappoint.

Great place for grabbing a taco in the center of old town. Cool art on the walls, not very expensive and figgen bangin tacos. I've had about 5 different ones and was not dissapointed in any- including the seafood ones which the majority were. Impressive, since we are no where near an ocean and the fish was grilled. I hear the margaritas are weak, which may or may not be a good thing depending. Would totally recommend it, especially since its next to one of my favorite bars, Patty's pub.

Love this bar. They have a mechanical bull, horse tack on the walls, fun tattooed staff and a full stocked bar. Their food is really good too believe it or not. Average prices for burgers, wraps and salads. Expensive for drinks but your right in the heart of old town and well worth it in entertainment value with the mechanical bull. Not uncommon to see women who should not sit in a high seated bar stool jump on (or rather crawl up with a helpful lift/shove from a male employee). Sometimes it's like watching a car accident, only its funny. So I'de rather pay scottsdale prices for a drink there instead of any other bar just to be able to watch the bull take win after win. Caution: not for the faint of heart, especially when they pull it forward and shake it real fast back and forth while a hefty lady has found her way on it. oooff well anyways. The place is fun, gets way packed on the weekend, and sometimes I have to wait way too long for a drink at the bar or my waitress to come back over to the table. By sometimes I mean 90% of the time especially when its not busy which makes no sense. Still love going there

coming from a place known for the best sushi I've had a hard time adjusting. Pearl has helped tremendously with that. Tuna Tuesdays are where its at! I've spent a lot of time and money there. The staff is great, they become your friends more than your servers and they're all a good time. The owner is a great guy. Its always busy for a reason. They have bangin specialty rolls, and if you want to do yourself a favor have the bottle rockets, its the best advice I could give you. Haven't had anything bad here yet. The garlic and soy edamame is just delightful and I really enjoy the mango lettuce wrap things. Saki bombs are encouraged, loud obnoxious groups of alchoholics are not only tolerated but welcomed. How do you go wrong.

I've worked in several of the high end commercial buildings in the Scottsdale area. I have to say, while the property itself is decent (aesthetically), the management leaves a lot to be desired.   They have their policies. Which are not to be questioned.   Allow me to retort. (for you Pulp Fiction fans out there) Our company, along with several others, allow well behaved dogs in the office which goes against Sky Song building policy. Reasonable.   Not every commercial property (however modern day, new and tech driven it is) will want dogs. There are likely several reasons for this: insurance, complaints, cleanliness, etc.   One of my colleagues had simply inquired about the policy and why it was in place. Response: "It has always been the policy that no dogs are allowed in the building." (The property is a couple years old) Perhaps she had just spilled coffee on herself or just typically reads 3/4 of questions in emails since the beginning of statements/questions doesn't really matter most of the time anyways.   We would have explained again that we were curious as to why the policy exists, however, before we could she had sent an aggressive/rude email to our office admin demanding she be the only point of contact.  Our admin had nothing to do with any of it but unfortunately was met with a not so nice note in her inbox over a simple question.  The short version is I give 1 star due to the lack of professionalism and consistently poor attitude of the building management at Sky Song. We weren't trying to ruin your day, just wanted to learn more about the reasons behind a simple policy. I have heard of similar experiences here which is why I chose to write this since we clearly it wasn't just a one off scenario.   An experience to take note of for companies looking into office space.   FYI we just moved into a 10,000 square foot office here. Not like we're at 4 person insurance agency.   The cafe is pretty good though...

I ate there 3 days ago for the first time and have gone back every day and ordered the same thing. This also happened to my coworker so becareful, you've been warned. The food is supreme. Their chicken is so good. I've only gotten the mediteranean pita which after I eat it I feel better, like I got the nutrition I needed, made with real chicken and fresh lett & tom. They put hummus and pickles in the wrap which brought a tear of joy to my eye when I discovered it. They also have interesting fresh brewed iced teas like kiwi green tea, black berry tea, etc. Totally recommend it, even in a food court in fashion square

Hands down this is my favorite place to go have a salad. Words cant exoress how much this restaurant means to me. The one at this location has an excellent wine selection. THE perfect place to wear your sunday best (old fashioned dress, white gloves, and a big white hat) and enjoy a consistently excellent meal in a beautiful atmosphere. Although dressing up isn't mandatory. It does not matter what you order it will be amazing. They have different foods on a more gourmet level without being straight up weird or over priced. Everything is delicious and healthy. Best of all the get their meats and vegetables from local farmers and it shows in the taste. The service is always outstanding. I have nothing bad to say about this place as I have never had a bad experience. They're like the Nordstrom of the restaurant business They have a customer for life.
