My 2 star breakdown:  1 because I loved my dress and 1 because the lady who does the alterations was very nice and seemed to enjoy what she does.  I only went to Kaira's because they happened to have the dress I wanted in stock.  The woman who helped me at the first appointment was great and I had a very pleasurable experience, unfortunately it went down hill from there.  Soon I started to understand all of the comments about how disorganized and unprofessional these people are.  Upon leaving, I asked if I could make my final payment over the phone instead of coming in, I was told no which was fine even though it didn't really make sense.  When the time came for me to make the payment I called just to be sure I really had to drive all the way over there, and to my surprise, when the store greeting started playing, there was a "make a payment" option!  I made my payment and asked for a receipt to be emailed to me, it never was.  I found, ordered, and paid for my dress in August.  I was told it would be in store mid December.  My wedding was January 30th.  Getting close to the end of December without hearing from them, I decided to call.  "Your dress will ship on 12/31 and in store on 01/02, when would you like to come in for alterations?"  I said 01/02 of course!  So, one of my bridesmaids and I show up that morning, we are told to wait, and after about 15 minutes go by the "store owner' comes over and says, "I'm sorry but I have no record of you having an appointment, your dress isn't even here!"  I tell her about my conversation with the person I made the appointment with, I didn't get a name.  She says they never make alteration appointments without the dress being in store and she has no idea why someone would do so, then she says, "The only thing I can think of is, one of our girls is pregnant and I don't wanna say 'pregnancy brain' but..."  Yes, blame you and your employee's incompetence on pregnancy brain, I'm a woman so of course I will understand, all I want to do with my life is pop out babies so I will have sympathy.  I DO NOT.  I would have been more satisfied with, "She's an idiot."  She tells me the dress will DEFINITELY be there the following week, so I reschedule my appointment.  The day came, my dress was there, and I got my fitting.  There were quite a bit of alterations so I was extremely nervous about time.  At this point, I think I had about three weeks until my wedding day.  Two weeks go by and I hear NOTHING.  Only after my MOH called and hassled them did we find out my dress was there and ready.  The "store owner" was there and didn't even look at me, the woman who helped me at my initial appointment was there, dressed slovenly and moping around, didn't say a word.    Luckily, my dress was perfect and my wedding beautiful.  I just wanted to warn any non suspecting patrons that may fall victim to this store.  They will only add stress to your already stressful planning!

I had never had my brows waxed or threaded before Farideh.  Less than a week before my wedding, I kept going back and forth on what to do with them.  I was extremely nervous and could not shake the thought of something going wrong with my face so close to the big day.  After reading numerous reviews on both waxing and threading salons I found Farideh.  She had such great reviews, her location was convenient, and the price could not be beat!  Everything happened so quickly, which I love!  I walked in, sat in the chair, and she started threading away.  I was pretty much in awe of her skill.  My brows were perfect.  I don't think I can every go back to plucking.  I will be paying her another visit ASAP.

Just as good as the NYC locations, so happy you are here!  I see some people complaining about size but this food is substantial; a burger, fries, and a beer (from Brooklyn Brewery I must add!) are just the right amount of food to fill you up without making you feel disgusting.  These are quality ingredients!  I almost added pickles to my SmokeShack and am so glad I didn't, the peppers are pickled and spicy.  I don't usually like bacon on my burgers but they use superior (Niman Ranch) bacon, it's crispy and flavorful.  This place has ruined "fast food" burgers for me and I couldn't be happier about that.  GO NOW!
