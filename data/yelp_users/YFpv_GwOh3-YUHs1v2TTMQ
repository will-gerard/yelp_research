so i didn't really have high hopes for this place because his show is just so fucking irritating and its not like he's back there in the kitchen whipping things up anywho bf and i were on our way to the pool and hungry it was lunch time so we decided to stop by but we almost got denied by the hostess because of my attire she which i kind of understand except i was wearing a dress with my bathing suit top under i offered to remove it to solve the problem and maybe this is just me being a snot but i really don't think of emrile's as being a high end restaurant. anywho the manager said it was okay if we sat at the bar i was really expecting mediocre food but it was really good i had some sort of seafood mixed grill with rice and this really delicious sauce that was pretty rich but went perfectly with the seafood and didn't overpower it bf had the rock shrimp po boy and the rock shrimp was delicious and so tender but he didn't really like the chips that came with. the service was good but its hard to have bad service when you're at the bar and the restaurant is relatively empty it would have been nice to sit at a table i had no idea that wearing a dress (a nice one from mango not one of those shitty juicy terry cloth ones) over a bathing suit to a restaurant at lunch time was so taboo especially when there's a guy already in the restaurant in basketball shorts oh well i was hungry and i had a great time at the pool after so que sera sera

i had a very rare medium rare fillet mignon here but the rareness was good because it gave the frites some nice flavor. good people watching i got to see a bunch of people eat it on the sidewalk out front those cooling sprinklers provide the perfect amount of moisture on the sidewalk below to make folks feet slide right out from under them good times

hey assholes don't try and hide the crab legs from me!!!! MINUS ONE STAR!! other than that things were pretty good some of the dishes there looked a bit sad but they had a great selection of salads and really yummy pretzel baguettes that even swiss boyfriend highly enjoyed but DON'T HIDE THE CRAB LEGS!!!

this place sucks its waaaaaay overcrowded the patrons are rude probably because they're disgruntled from being squished into this kinda small club like sardines. I spent the whole night flinching away from peoples cigarettes that place has rogue drunk person cigarette burn written all over it

went around 10:30 with 2 friends we're regular people so we figured it would be good to get there kind of early since the lines at new clubs are no joke. but the oddest thing happened we went to use the atm and one of the security guys suggested we go and talk to the promoter/vip hostess with the clip board about after hours so we did. she walked with us and talked to us about draiis sp? and introduced us to the guy that would be working the door  there and then she let us in the club. sooo strange but soo nice!!! we went down stairs and into the club its beautiful it wasn't very crowded which was nice because it gave us a chance to look around. beautiful gorgeous and huge!! drinks are pricey so umm get a good buzz going in your room. there are plenty of regular folks there along with the people that think they're somebody. so avoid the morons and you'll have a great time!

lobster guacamole is amazing it sounds strange but its soo delicious plus their chips are fresh and their salsas are great too.   i love their seafood tostadas they're a fantastic summer dish but id eat them in the middle of february and be just as happy.   don't get the cucumber martini its sweet no bueno

i wish i could give this place no stars. i went there on a sunday in august. guy of the moment and i decided to sit outside by the fountains where they have those lovely lucite chairs set up. there were 2 other couples outside having drinks we waited and waited for the cocktail waitress we had seen socializing with the bartender to come out and get our drink orders but she never came finally we had to go inside and order our drinks and the bartender told us that someone would be right out with them nothing fancy just a beer and a mojito. we waited and waited in the mean time the useless ass cocktail waitress manages to spill a drink on someone and break the glass way to go girlfriend. we waited some more until finally my guy went inside to see his opened beer sitting there waiting to served so he has to ask the bartender if that was his beer and where the mojito is? my cocktail was delivered by my guy the mojito was mediocre but at this point i just wanted to leave. we asked the cocktail waitress for the check but of course she didn't come back with it so we had to go back into the bar and ask the bartender for the check. it seemed like having having customers pained him or something. i just wanted to yell i'm sorry to disturb you but you fucking work here.

how does this place have such high marks i was not impressed at all. the decor left soooo much to be desired. the playboy club is dazzling and then you take the escalator up stairs and its such a let down. the dj left a lot to be desired as well.
