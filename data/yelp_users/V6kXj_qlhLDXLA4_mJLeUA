I cannot convey how happy I was with my experience at Soundwerks.  I have had quite a few professional installs before and I must say Don and his team are head and shoulders above the rest.  Don and his staff are both friendly and knowledgeable, far exceeding my expectations.  They did amazing work on my G35 with the up most attention to detail and client satisfaction.  I will definitely be referring him to all my friends and family.

Cracker's is the breakfast spot to visit.  Not only is the food amazing but the customer service sets it far above the competition.

I purchased a Living Social voucher to get a cleaning and I had no idea what I was getting into.  This is the absolute worst Cleaning Company I have ever tried using.  We had our first appointment set up and they never showed up.  They never communcated that they were cancelling and days later said sorry they were busy finishing up another job.  We setup a new appointment I hope they would rectify their first mistake to find out.....yes you guessed it, didn't show up again.  They apologized again and said they would give us another free service.  Since then they have not responded at all and its been almost a month.  I knew it was fishy when they asked for my Living Social voucher number over text for I later come to find out that they marked my Living Social as used even though they never came!?  I do not know how this company is still in business.    Avoid using them under any circumstance.
