I get a hankering for great pasta, like any day of the week, totally.  You get it, I know. Fettuccine with the meat sauce. Great portions, I love that a salad, and bread came with my purchase. Excellent service. You've been around for 50 years for some reason. Please drain the pasta a little better next time. I'll have to try the pizza next time. Lots of love,  Chris.

For being basic as it gets. Great value for the money, excellent service, and the food was great. My only complaint is there's no soda fountain. Boo...

Jake gets really busy on a Saturday night, I'm getting an industrial ear piercing tonight, and he's really professional. Great place for piercings. Edit: I got my industrial, and I'm going to return.

Spaghetti was watery from not draining pasta completely.  Sauce comes from a can. Taste the metal... Although the price was right. 4.99.

OK,  Mike, you're awesome, thanks for doing it again. Spaghetti was way better this time.

Beef and broccoli rocks, teriaki chicken sucked.  I have experienced better. (insert farting noise here)

Only went to this place for the Sangria (Passion Fruit of course) but, we actually got chatted up by the owner. Found that Phoenix magazine put them up on the map in their latest issue, no payment necessary. Went during the Festival of lights parade and couldn't find our way out after dinner... what a mess this cen pho traffic. I had their burrito sorta enchilada style with the creamy sauce. (sauce makes everything better) just wasn't sure it was worth the extra 4 bucks for sauce. The Salsa was bad ass, like getting kicked in the mouth... Loved it. Abso****ingloutley Love this place.

There aren't many times in my life I have to send an entree back, but this is one. Bland. Alfredo. Sauce. My worst enemy. I get the same crap back with a discussion that back of house has altered the dish to my taste. Note to the GM. Don't lie to the guest, when they know bland food when they taste it. I gave you leave to amend your defect and I get a defensive GM. Sorry shouldn't ever be in your vocabulary. Fix it. Say you were wrong, and fix the damn dish. You had one chance, and blew a second. I gave my leftovers to a homeless person, and he thought it  was crap also.

Awesome Stuffed Meat pie... needed more sauce, but I'm just saucy like that. I'll be back next time for a regular pie. Tip: Sit closer to the ovens... warmer part of the dining area.

This is the spot, You would never know how comfy this spot was til you get inside. Music's a little loud for being such a chill place.If it ever rains, just go straight to the living room/sitting area and there's a little fireplace, couches, little table.The coolest thing is there's a tv on the cieling always playing adult swim, if you think i'm joking go stop in and see.

Sub par. I knew I should have just listened to the other reviews, but I had to see what was true. Had the blt, not bad, but cold fries. Honestly, you can't screw up a blt, but McFaddens did. Cheap pub grub, at 10 bucks a plate... Sorry ass place, dead lunch crowd. Seems like the only thing that keeps it in business is the  booze.

Came in today.  No soy out by the soda station. Darn, reach to a table. Made my connection with the shuttle. Chicken chow mein was great, I enjoyed it on the bus. Lots of love. Little pricey for what you're selling, but I'd still come back.

Man, I was really excited to give your shop another go. I was very impressed that someone came outside to see how our food was, you don't always see that at what we like to call a quick serve resto... I call this my "thank you, baby jesus" restaurant when my head is still in my hands from other restaurants that miss the mark. I had the Arizona burger, and it fell apart on me... I wanted to bust out the knife and fork... Then there was the smash fries, too, oh yeah... I love you guys, and yes, I am a fan for sure...

Umm, This place is off the hook like a telephone. I went right before with Jayme, we got a charcuterie (spelling?), she got the porkwich with kale salad, I got the BLT crab cake sandwich with mac and cheese... I love my cheese, and this was from what I could taste, several 'spensive ones. I definitely will be back for Churn...  But just one question I forgot to ask the server. "Where do you get your bacon?"

Good wings. They were ginormous. I felt like putting my feet up on the bench, and no one gave me any guff about it. You don't need much coin to eat at hh here, friends. Great wait staff, awesome work.

So, I was cruising along listening to the sounds of the International Festival at GCC and lo and behold, FOOD TRUCKS! I walked up to Epic and ordered a Sonoran Dog... I wish it were spicier, but it definitely did what it was supposed to do... Make me whole again. I must try a different rendition at another time. I'm following you guys on twitter just like I said. I devoured the dog in about 2 min. Folks, this is what happens when you take a food truck into a college campus, hungry college students await. Thanks Again, hope to see you folks soon... -Chris Robinson

Bland, utterly flavorless. I wish I went to subway. Oooohhh, their receipt was printed on their paper, too. I think dog food is better.

Fun joint, I'll be back for sure. Great for late night studying, when you can't study at home.

My only gripe is lemon in the hollandaise, and no chorizo. Boo... everything else was awesome, like a Dennys-late night, but way more fun. Midnight breakfast.
