Review #799  "There is no sadder sight than a young pessimist." Mark Twain  I don't mind getting older but, I wanna have fun and stay young (at heart) forever.  That's why I love places like the Arizona Science Center.  It's a great place for kids to learn and play, and adults to... learn and play... and watch their kids having fun while learning.  Sure, a lot of the exhibits are geared towards kids but unless you're the next Einstein, an adult will learn a lot too.  You just have to open your mind to the fun.    Or go on 'adult night' for kid-free fun. keke    I went for the the elite event a few weeks ago so I didn't get to explore the whole museum but, I'll definitely be back.  In the meantime, my favorite exhibit is the Bed of Nails (dadadummmmm).  The only note is that, while most of the exhibits were awesome, a few could use a lil maintenance.  They probably just get a lot of harsh kid use! haha  Next time I go... I wanna do the bicycle on a high wire thing!   Wootwoot!  See ya there!

5 stars for the fact that Phoenix even has a Chinese Cultural Center area.  The only place I've been to in it is the grocery store but one day, I plan to check-out the lil gardens and restaurants.  Can't wait until they get more in there! (Don't go expecting a big Chinatown-like scene.)  The take-out from inside the grocery store is pretty tasty, inexpensive and fast!  See ya there!

Flavors of India serves up a decent lunch buffet.  I've been there a couple of times though and it seems some days, the food is better than others.  Also, I wish they offered a bit more selection.  I've teetering between a 3 and 4 star but because of the reasonable price and friendly service, I'm bumping up to a 4 star.  I'll have to go again to make a final decision.   See ya there!

Camelback Women's Health is my choice for prenatal care.  Why?  Well, I really like the easy scheduling, almost non-exsistent wait time (both in the lobby and for making appts) and my doctor, Dr Gregory De Santo.    This location (32nd St) is the 2nd location I have visited and actually, is the closer to my house.  Dr De Santo works between both offices, with Tue and Thur being at this one, I believe.  It's much the same here and has the same set-up and benefits as the other (ultrasound machines, lab in office, etc).  I went to the Scottsdale location for so long but think I'll finish out my pregnancy here.  It's just closer to my house... oh and it has no stairs. haha  Here's my review on the other location.. just thought I'd paste it because I'm lazy to rewrite everything...  Now that I've had a couple of visits to Camelback Women's Health, a review is appropriate.  After finding them on an internet search for prenatal services, I called and spoke to a couple of women.  After answering many of my questions over a few calls, I was ready to make an appt.  ask me what my choice of Dr was and I simply ask them to set me up with the one they preferred... enter, Dr. Gregory DeSanto.  I was always told that picking your maternity doctor was quite the chore.  It's joked about in movies and a matter of stress for many women.  I'm a lil more laid back than the average woman about such matters but, after I met Dr. DeSanto, I really didn't see the need to go to a dozen different doctors and stress.  He's relaxing, knowledgeable and does things himself that other doctors pass off to technicians - like my ultrasound.  He did an excellent job explaining everything he was doing, getting great angles of my lil baby and even showing me the gender before others say they can tell.  It was the most amazing experience to see my lil guy flipping around!!  I'd heard other women say that their ultrasound tech didn't tell them much and actually had them worried by not talking and explaining things but, there was none of these issues with DeSanto.  I'm a fan of his calm demeanor and simple, easy-going approach to things.  * Dr DeSanto is knowledgeable, calming and explains things well.  And Jamie was so helpful with many of my misc. questions and helping me get set-up!  * They have their own lab and ultrasound machine in their clinic so you don't have to run around, wait, or make separate appts for lab work!  * Everyone is friendly enough and it feels like a cozy, comfy environment.    * There is little waiting time before your appt starts and they must keep gaps in the day because you can get in to see the Dr. in a timely manner.  See ya there!

I'm a fan of his calm demeanor and simple, easy-going approach to things.  The reason for taking away a star is that on both visits, I've felt there could be a lil more communication with the the ladies in the office.  The first visit, I told them on check-in that I had 2 appts and even wrote in the information on the sign-in sheet but, they never sent me down to my first appt.  I didn't know there's almost no wait time at this clinic, (unlike other doctor's offices) so I sat there waiting forever and finally ask when it was almost time for my 2nd appt. because I was afraid they were going to overlap.  Luckily, they were able to fit me in for my 1st appt after my 2nd appt but that whole situation could have easily been avoided with a lil more communication.  On the 2nd visit, after my weight/vitals check, I was told to that I needed to start a test but then she left me without any instructions on where to go or what to do after that test.  I think it was assumed I knew the drill already because I am in my 2nd trimester, but that was only my 2nd appt.    Those lil glitches were barely noticeable though compared to the satisfaction I feel with the clinic overall.    * Dr DeSanto is knowledgeable, calming and explains things well.  And Jamie was so helpful with many of my misc. questions and helping me get set-up!  * They have their own lab and ultrasound machine in their clinic so you don't have to run around, wait, or make separate appts for lab work!  * Everyone is friendly enough and it feels like a cozy, comfy environment.    * There is little waiting time before your appt starts and they must keep gaps in the day because you can get in to see the Dr. in a timely manner.  I'll be back next month for my 6 month check-up!  See ya there!

I've just returned home from another successful visit to Dr. DeSanto and Camelback Women's Health.  This was my 4th visit and each time, I'm impressed by how nicely they can fit me in to a time I need.  They've never canceled an appt on me or even rescheduled!  Plus, with my doctor, I have my choice of different offices on different days.    This time, my appt was a special case because I was in an automobile accident last week... yes, a guy rear-ended me in my 6th month of pregnancy!  :(  Of course all I could do was worry about my baby but,  DeSanto put my anxiety to rest with some talk and an ultrasound.  I sat there and watched my lil guy hiccup for a while (while the dr was doing some measuring and checking).  It was relaxing...  It's especially nice that Dr. DeSanto can answer all of my questions and never seems in a rush.  Guess with his experience, he doesn't get stumped too often.  Maybe I should try to think of an especially uncommon and hard question next time. lol  See ya there!  PS  I see someone seems to have something against my Dr but we can tell your reviewS are fake.  :p

Just flew out of the Phoenix airport... no really, I'm sitting on the plane, bored and Yelping.  I'll post this tomorrow...  Sky Harbor Int'l Airport is a nice lil big airport that has some friendly features that are nice for convenience.  First off, all the arrivals don't have to cluster around 1 passenger pick-up area.  Phoenix airport has a north, south, east and west curb for pick-up.  Next, their signs for passengers waiting for a ride are clearly marked so you know your terminal, area and curb while you wait.  Next, their security was a breeze... but maybe I just timed my trip right.  And finally... are you ready for this... I bought an nice cold bottled water for... wait for it... under 2$.  No, I'm not kidding.  Only minor irritation is that some of the bathroom latches don't latch well.  Grrr. (North Curb bathroom specifically)  LoL  This is one airport I don't mind so much.  According to Ron L. though, it seems like it's improved much over the years, so I'm glad to be visiting it now.  See ya there!

Cheap, fresh food, fast... 24 hours a day.  What's not to like?  Sure, sometimes it's a lil greasy but, it's not as bad as some and in a 24 hour breakfast joint like this, a lil grease is to be expected.    This location is a lil newer and cleaner than the average Waffle House.  They make up food that's just as good as all the others... my typical orders are the biscuits and gravy, grilled chicken sandwich or various breakfast combos (but never the waffle - don't go there).   They have a pretty good salad, if you're ever in an no-grease mood while at Waffle House. lol  Trust me and try the biscuits and gravy (gluttony) or plain grilled chicken sandwich (healthier)... they delish!  Good people watching.  See ya there!

This review is for Banner Desert Medical's education center... which was great.  I've taken a couple of prenatal education classes here and each one has had a knowledgeable, enthusiastic nurse instructor and good information.  Their personalities and obvious passion for their job and hospital make me think I'd choose to be a patient here in the future.    You can see their classes and register online, which is convenient.  Check your insurance... as some will pay for the classes! :)  http://www.bannerhealt...  My classes were Childbirth Prep and a Baby Care class.   2 thumbs up for both!  I'm looking at what else I can take next... I definitely think mothers who are planning to nurse should take the breastfeeding class!  See ya there!

Best Hong Kong Dining is the most authentic Chinese food I've found in the Phoenix area so far... in a restaurant anyway.  It's a chop shop... meaning you can eat at their restaurant or buy meat by the pound and they'll 'chop' it up for you.  You can often hear the sound of their cleaver working... chopchopchopchop. lol  It's reassuring to me.  It's sounding out authentic Chinese bbq pork, duck, etc.    That being said, I haven't ordered out of the chop shop yet.  They have my favorite Chinese dish, cod (or random fish filet) in black bean sauce.  It is delicious here... fresh and sure to please any fish lovers pallet.    I'll definitely be back and though it's not a fancy place for a 1st date, I'd take a group of friends here.  See ya there!

Korean Food + Me = true love.  I adore Korean food.  I'm not kidding. It's probably my favorite cuisine.  If you haven't tried it, you should.  My typical favorites are kimchi jigae (spicy tofu/kimchi/pork soup), Haemul pajeon (seafood pancake), Galbi (short ribs), oh jing oh duk bokki (spicy squid with rice cakes), Bibimbap (rice bowl with veggies and bulgogi), mul mandu (dumplings)... I could go on and on.    If it's your first time with Korean food and you're not very adventurous, get the Galbi and JapChae noodles or Bibimbap (but be sure to try the side dishes (called panchan).  If you're in for the adventure and heat... see my list above! :)  Hope and dread were the battling in me when I left CA and realized I'd have to find Korean food here in AZ.  Turned out to be a needless battle though as the Phoenix area continues to surprise me with their hidden and limited but delicious, authentic fare...  Yum yum Hodori!  This was my first taste of Phx area Korean food and I have to say, I was impressed!  It's much better than I expected it to be.  They have an extensive menu so I ordered Bibimbap, Kimchi jigae, and Galbi.  It was all good.  The panchan was tasty, too.  I still crave LA Korean food sometimes but this was definitely good enough to return to, many time.  See ya there!

Mesa Pediatrics is my choice for my son's pediatrician.  Why?  Well, I checked them out initially because they take my insurance and they were close to my house. haha After visiting their office and meeting a couple of their doctors though, I decided I like them enough to stay.  Their doctors and staff are friendly.  They have appt times available when I need.  They don't make me wait too long in the lobby.  And they have a sick child/well child entrance for your kiddos with a play yard outside for the well ones.    I have had a variety of visits for my lil guy... routine check-ups, vaccinations, a tongue-tied clipping and a circumcision... so I have a good impression on their abilities.    The only lil annoyance is that sometimes their phone lines get tied up.  About half the time they answer right away but sometimes I have to listen to a buncha automated stuff.   Small price to pay for an office that I feel comfortable with though.    My main doctor is Delphis Richardson MD and I have also seen and like Darcy Winterland MD.  Richardson has a great 'keep smiling' attitude and Winterland was very nice and knowledgeable, as well.    See ya there! :)

After moving to CA and reflecting back on this pediatrics office, I have a new appreciation for Dr Richardson and the way this office runs.  You don't have to wait a month for an appt and the doctor is thorough in explaining your growth charts and questions to you.  My new pediatrician is nice enough but, I didn't even GET growth charts from him! lol  Thank-you, Dr Richardson... I'm still smiling!

Village Inn has the BEST Chocolate French Silk Pie ever made.... I know nothing about their food and have nothing else to say, really.    Oh wait, I do.  The kid with the cool blond tiped hair that served us the other night was really nice.  He seemed to be covering the whole floor with ease.    Go for pie.  You're welcome.  See ya there.

OMG... I cannot believe I haven't reviewed Taquitos Jalisco yet.  Talk about oversight...   Taquitos Jalisco is the BEST place to get taquitos... in the world.  I say that from a position of authority.  I've tried taquitos far and wide... all around the world.  The perfection of Taquitos Jalisco has yet to be matched.  They are crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and smothered in sour cream and guac... just the way they should be.  The plate also has the BEST rice and beans (ok, the rice is good but the beans are the best) and a small side salad... you know, so you get your greens in. haha  Eat the salad, it's good for you.   Aside from the excellent taquitos, they also have great shrimp dishes.  And the staff there is always friendly.  The only thing I'll say is they get really busy sometimes so plan ahead.   Tip - If you're ordering the taquitos, make sure they don't give you the combo #1 which is tacos.  You'll be so sad.  happened to me once and I've had to correct them during the ordering process several times since. Seems taco and taquito is interchangable in Spanish so they automatically default to tacos.    THIS IS THE BEST TAQUITO ever... and their refried beans are superior, too!  Man... now I'm hungry.  Definitely see you there.

After going to the Chandler Best Buy and this Best Buy location, I decided to come back here to buy my computer and all of it's accessories.  Why?  Because the staff here was better and manager, Jeff, was so friendly and helpful.    The store is a large, warehouse looking space but it's packed with goodies.  It's definitely worth the trip!  See ya there!

What a cute spot for some local flavor.  My beau and I headed out here to walk around when I was very, very pregnant... overdue actually. haha  We figured it'd be interesting to see but still close enough to town to be safe, just in case.  We were right.  This ghost town is a neat tourist attraction with good views and interesting shops.  It also has a train service that we didn't take but heard was fun.    It's not the most exciting place in the world but for a day out to stroll around and converse, it's some good fun.      Might see ya there.

So I haven't been here for dimsum, like everyone else seems to be reviewing, so I guess I"ll clarify...   My review is for their dinner menu.  A friend and I had dinner last week and we ended up at C-Fu because I was in the mood for some authentic Chinese.  Well, he's Chinese (kinda - haha) and recommended this restaurant because he grew-up coming here with his parents.    We ordered some dumplings, which they steamed for us, a spicy pork chop dish and then I ordered my favorite which wasn't on the menu, sauteed fish filet in black bean sauce.  All of the food was good and they were very nice in accommodating my special order.  I'd reorder any of the dishes we had again, and I really loved having left-overs the next day. :)  See ya there!

Lee Lee's is a big and nice Asian grocery store in N. Chandler.  It offers fresh meats, seafoods, fruits and veggies (some imported, some domestic) and a variety of packaged Asian food: Vietnamese, Indian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, etc.  While it's not quite as nice and clean as the Chinese Cultural Center market, it's definitely well-stocked and easy to get to.    The only thing I wish they had is a better prepared food counter and cleaner bathrooms.  I do like that they give a %10 customer discount at the register. :)  See ya there!

Apple stores and service rock.  I went here about a week before Christmas to get my roomie something he didn't have (that's hard to do).  After a few minute of browsing, a sales assistant came up and ask if he could help me.  He explained the product I was looking at and showed me all it's awesome features.  I was sold (even though it's a lil pricey).  When I told him I'd take it, he just rang me up right there and emailed the reciept to me.    Awesome, efficient and eco-friendly. :)   I'll definitely be back!  See ya there.

This Lowe's is a big, beautiful example of a home improvement and gardening store!  I love walking around the aisles... it's nostalgic for me since my dad was a shop teacher when I was a kid and I was practically raised in a hardware store. haha     Anyway, on my visit last week, I went specifically for paint samples and ideas on an upcoming bathroom renovation.  Lowes' provided both, although the looks I was interested in came from their bathroom improvement books rather than their floor models.  At least they have floor displays set-up.  Some other stores (no names here) like Lowe's don't even have that!    So with the help of the super friendly and attentive staff, I ended up leaving with a bunch of new ideas in my head and I'll definitely be back!  See ya there!

This Barnes and Noble is just as big, clean, and organized as the rest.  It's a good book store if you don't mind the corporate world.  I like them because they make it very easy to order books that you can't find anywhere else, no pre-purchase necessary.  Last week, I ordered 2 books and this week, they called me to let me know they'd arrived.  I went in, looked at my books, found another book I liked and... was on my way!  See ya there!

Olive Garden is one of the few chain restaurants that has a special place in my heart... mostly because my mom and dad like it so much but also because I really like their salad bowl and bread sticks.   When I'm home, on the rare occasion we eat out, we  sometimes go there for family dinners.    I recently met a new friend at the Chandler location for lunch because they still have that great all-you-can-eat soup and salad for lunch... Yum!  Really, the soup and salad is my favorite thing.They have a chicken and dumpling soup now, which was delicious and easy on my tummy (was sensitive that day)!   Might see ya there!

Ok, so... I'm really picky about my water places.  When I'm in CA, I drive clear across two towns to find a place with great service and quality water.  (The CA location has curbside service and lets me buy gallons in advance on a loyalty card so I don't have to deal with a cash exchange each time or even get out of my car!) Now that I'm in AZ, I needed to find something similar.  Fortunately, my friend took me to a Water and Ice in Chandler after a play date at KTR (awesome place for kids, btw).  We only went that day for their Thrifty ice cream (the kids adored it) but after that first introduction, I started noticing Water and Ice shops around the area.    Last week, I'd had enough with our yucky $0.25 a gallon water machine water.  I searched for a Water and Ice that is located by my work and found this location.  I went in and was happy to see that they offer great water service, the same delicious Thrifty scoop ice cream, and most importantly, a free water bottle cleaner!!!  All of this and they're still only $0.25 a gallon.  Now if only they'd let me buy $15 at a time (12 gallons) so I didn't have to deal with money each time. haha  A guy named Victor was working there on the day I arrived and he helped me fill and take the full bottles back out to my car.  I really appreciate that!!!  I'll definitely be back frequently, and even bring my lil guy in for ice cream.    They also have other other snacks, drinks, and water supplies there.   Oh and btw, since I still had water machine water in my machine when I got home, we were able to do a taste test on the two.  Water and Ice water didn't have the weird aftertaste the water machine water had.    Definitely see ya there!

Unfortunately, this location is one of the worst Whole Foods I've been to. Usually, I'm not an overly picky person but when you go to a store that charges a premium, you expect a certain level of product and service, no? I've been here several times but after this last trip, won't bother again. The fresh food and salad bar was a complete mess, with many things being empty or cross contaminated. This was at 7pm folks, not close to close. We almost left but instead, picked around and finally got two salad bars, two soups and a drink and a small snack for my son - the bill was close to $30... No joke. Then, almost nothing in the salad bar stuff was actually good. For example, the flavor had been cooked out of the edamame. The Mac and cheese was gross, the steak on my friends salad was so salty you could barely eat it, and the rest of the food was nothing to mention.  We left in a pretty sad state, throwing away most of our $30 worth of food... Thinking we 150% should have found a Sweet Tomatoes instead!  They only reason Whole Foods gets two stars is because they carry nice, natural products, like mineral sunblock and salt rock deodorant.  We'd still recommend a different location. Won't see ya there.

Why do women pay full salon prices on a regular basis when there are fun, less expensive places like Carsten Institute of Hair & Beauty?    This place is like a top-notch salon that happens to have students being trained instead of women who have already graduated.  You can tell it's run like a well-oiled machine and everyone is confident in their abilities.  They have good prices (with additional student discounts) and they carry only Aveda products.  It's not the least expensive cosmetology school I've been to but, they are definitely one of the nicest so it makes up for it.     I wish I could remember the name of my lady from a few weeks ago.  She tinted my eyelashes (student price $12) and did a great job.  It was more relaxing than a lot of my actual salon experiences.  Unfortunately she told me she was graduating and so I'll have to try someone else next time.  I'm confident in this facility though so I look forward to it!  See ya there!

This might be one of those places that I'd be tempted to stop into occassionally if they had anything above average.  Unfortunately, their fish taco was good but nothing special and their 'service'... if that's what you'd call it, was not very friendly.  The only saving grace was the taco was only $2.  Too bad... the place looked cute!  Won't see ya here!

This Sprint store is a lot like other Sprint stores but it has better music! Mike S and Chuck helped me transfer contacts from my old Palm to my new Evo and I was out in less than 20 minutes.  With such a simple request, I didn't even have to sign-in and wait. :)  They also have a self-serve kiosk so you can quickly pay your phone bill.  See ya there!

Dear Lifetime Fitness... please come to the SF Bay Area.  I cannot say enough about how much I loved you guys.  You make me love to work-out and be consistent in getting to the gym.  My biggest rave is about your childcare.  You offer an infant area when so many other clubs require the child to be a certain age.  You were my son's first experience with child care and he really loved it.  He'd get excited and start kicking his legs when we walked through your child center doors.  You started us off well. (Members gets 2 free hours of child care everyday while they are working out, eating or visiting Lifetime's salon/spa.  And the center is really fun and extremely secure.)  You also has great classes, an amazing huge gym, giant indoor and outdoor slides (complete with cool slides) and an awesome friendly staff and customer service.  I felt like a valued client.  Everywhere you go, people are genuinely smiling, happy and asking you how you are.  My favorite nights were when the men in suits were in the back, helping the house keeping catch-up with fold towels.  Everyone would still be joking and having fun.  That kind of environment makes me smile and be in a good mood.  Thank-you... and please come to Sunnyvale, CA.  Love,  Susan (and little Ian)~  PS Your child care workers were great!  And I love how you kinda rotate people thru the gym.  I get to know more people and I bet that keeps them from getting bored.  See ya there!

Boston Market... yum.  If you're in the mood for some home-style foods or in a hurry and want some comfort food, this is the place to go!  I especially like this location because they have the same menu with healthy options AND they'll make you up a fresh batch of something if they're running low or it's late and they ran out.  My roomie and I sometimes stopped here after our Lifetime Fitness nights. :)  See ya there!

The ladies who run this cleaners are so friendly, I trust them with our dry cleaning and alterations.  They always do a great job cleaning and alterations usually come out well too... and for a great price!  Only thing is if something you're having cleaned or altered has more than one thing that's needs attention, you need to be very specific and point it out more than once.  Most of the time though, they are great!    See ya there!

It's not often that you step into a store and feel like you've been transported to another realm.  That's what you get at this Psychic Eye Book Shop location though.  The smells and the sounds penetrate your senses as your eyes dart from one unique lil object to the next.  It's a great place to go for a different sort of gift, psychic readings or just to browse.    You can get books, candles, jewelry, incense, gifts from other countries, house decor, meditation tools, and more.  My friends and I like it but only make it in every couple of years, it seems.  Btw.. this is a new location!  Check the address if you're gonna stop in. :)  Might see ya there!

Funny, fun salon, located in the main China Town center, a few doors down from Sam Woo and the Ranch 99 grocery market.  Good location, reasonable prices.    After checking out the Vdara spa and them not having an appt available until late in the night, I decided to turn to Yelp for a place to go to get our locks tended.  I found Beaut Point and we decided to give them a try.  The staff here are always joking around and having a good time.  They also had the TV tuned into a dvd of a live Stone Temple Pilots concert while I was there, which was good listening music.  My lady, Sophia, did a simple style for my hair and my friend got a haircut.  We both liked the outcome.    We looked beautiful for the Cirque show we went to!  Simple style: $45 Men Haircut: $15  (much better than the $90 Vdara would have charged)  We'll continue to go back for all of our Vegas hair needs!  See you there!

The Joyful House is one of the few China Town restaurants that I never got around to trying when I lived in Vegas but... on my last trip here, I met some friends there...  It's good.  And nice inside... and they accommodated our group really well with little complaint.  I'd say 4 star overall except.. for the dish I ordered.  Lucky me, we were eating family style.  I ordered the seabass mushroom claypot which sounded amazing and was the most expensive thing we ordered... but it was toooo fishy tasting.  Everything was great except for my dish.  *cry*  I'd still go back... I don't hold a grudge.  See ya there.

First off let me say I agree with 'Megan W' when she says don't go to the strip club if you're not in the right state of mind.  You'll just spend a lot of money and be irritated about it, probably making your friends time less fun while you're at it (or afterwards with your negative comments). They wanna have a good time, don't whine/complain and ruin it for everyone else... 'eewww, there were guys up in my face/rubbing all over me...' DUH! You're in a strip club, they chat you up and dance like that because that's typically what girls want when they go there.  I hate it when girls bitch at strip clubs (girl or guy).  If you're gonna bitch and complain, just don't go.  If you can't be cool chill chick, go to a show while the guys go to the club.  I used to live in Vegas and loved to go to Olympic Garden occassionally to see my sexy Vietnamese dancer (Tiki) who worked upstairs. :)  I love ASIAN MEN!!  He has such a sexy body and some fly dance moves... but isn't too dirty, just sexy and sensual.  Or maybe he wasn't dirty just with me cause he could tell it wasn't necessary - might be with other girls. *shrug*  I miss him now... gonna have to make a trip to Vegas pretty soon.   I'll post some pics of the club, just cause I'm that bored. LoL  Other than that, the downstairs girls are alright.  I'm pretty picky about girls but could usually find one or two to dance for me and my boyfriend.

Hmm... I'm not sure what I was expecting from my first taste of Native American food but, my Navajo Taco from The Fry Bread House was did not live up to any ideas I had.  The fry bread is good enough... of course, anything you deep fry is usually tasty but, the taco was super bland and nothing interesting.  It basically was fried bread with lettuce, beans and some cheese slapped in it.  :-/  When I add the lackluster food to the fact that the man at the counter was not friendly at all... rude actually, I don't have a very satisfied feeling about my experience.  My friend was trying to order the stew and some fry bread and the man treated him like he was dumb for not knowing that you have to order a combo to get both.  Then, when we ask what drinks they had, the man kinda rolled his eyes and pointed to a sign... again, like we should have already know where the sign was or what their options were.  Really?  We walked in and right up to the counter so we didn't have much chance to familiarize ourselves with their exact set-up.  I almost said something but, didn't want any chance of retaliation in our food.   So, my friends stew was full of flavor and my taco had none.  The only saving factor was the dessert fry bread at the end...   I'd go back to try other things if friends invited me again but, I might try to find a different fry bread location since the big guy behind the counter was so rude and condescending at this one.    Prolly won't see ya there.

Wow, what a cool museum!  I went on their free day, which falls on the 1st Sunday of every month but it's absolutely worth full admission price.  My first impression was so cute too because they were letting all the lil kids have fun with sidewalk chalk art.  Then, once I stepped inside the building, I was super excited... they have some pretty impressive dinosaur skeletons!  Walking on, each room was filled with wonder.  It is a must-do if you have kids, and a should-do even if you don't!   :)  See ya there!

Tip: To find the hitch installation, go to the far left side *when looking from the street* and down to the very back of the parking lot.  Apparently this location is the best if you want a hitch installed.  Andy from Broadway in Mesa sent me over.  The guys who installed everything were pretty nice.  It took a bit more than an hour though so be prepared for a bit of a wait.  And... since people are gonna be stuck back there waiting so long, they should have a vending machine of some kind!!!  I was so thirsty  and it was so hot outside that I didn't want to take my baby out in the heat and walk around the block to the main office for their vending machine.  :-/  At least put a complimentary water dispenser or something!  lol  But really, these guys were good and I am happy with my hitch.  Might see ya there!

This is a cute lil Italian market on N Scottsdale Rd.  It's a lil hidden but has easy parking.  If you go there, you can pick-up some pre-made lunch and desserts from the deli section or store up on imported groceries for your house.    There aren't many tables for eating so if you're going to have lunch and eat there, I'd suggest going a lil before or after normal lunch rush hours.  I'm a fan of their lemon bar.  It's very tart and lemony!!  Might see ya there!

Ok, there's not much I can say that over 150 reviews haven't already said... so I'll keep this brief.    Tasty hummus and pita - check Delicious gyro sandwich - check (pickle was new to me but tasty) Amazingly good lil baklava treats - check  Great prices - check check check (under $10 a person)  You get the picture... everything was delicious and prices are super.  I have a feeling that this will be a new regular joint for the roomie and me.  We love great food at great prices.  (And the baklava alone is reason to stop in for a quick treat - even if you're not hungry!)  See ya there!

Love love love this place.  Tasty with great prices... who can beat that?  My newest thing is to order a gyro-to-go and enjoy it at home.  I'm a mom now so eating at a restaurant is a lot harder than it used to be. haha  See ya there!

Sometimes it's better not to ask.  For example... how did a pregnant chick end up at Christie's Cabaret?  Well... I think it has something to do with being permanent designated driver.  lol    Christie's is a nice looking club, with a center stage and $10 table dances.   Sonny was the best dancer in the opinion of my friends and me.  She had a bangin' body and did sexy dances.    The music was good because there was variety but, the club could have offered a bit more variety in body shape and some real, healthy sized boobs. haha  But... for the most part, the girls were pretty and there were even a few good dancers.  :)  I will mention that one or two dancers were so anorexic looking, I felt they needed to get off the meth diet...      All-in-all, we had a good time.  Even I did, no drinking involved.    So... $12 cover fee, $10 table dances and a $12 ATM FEE... beware of that! I'd go back.  See ya there!

Free Diagnostic print-out of your service engine light comes on!  The guy behind the counter did seem a lil more knowledgeable than the guy at the 'other' store did though. haha    Besides that, it's your basic auto store.    Might see ya there!

My favorite pair of riding boots busted the zipper so I took them over to my neighborhood boot repair place, Abe's, to see what could be done about it.  The guy behind the counter explained the process and quoted me $25 for the repair.  The problem was I was on a short timeline (flight left in 3 days) and he wouldn't give an option for a quicker turnaround.  Most places will just tack on $5 and let you pick it up early but I donno... either they don't do this or he didn't want to.  Was really hoping to find a good shoe repair as I seem to need them a lot lately...  Won't see ya there.

Stopped by this 24 Hour Fitness location the other day to take a look around and get in a lil fitness.  The facility was nice and clean with the machines on the 2nd floor and the pool, sauna, child care and locker rooms on the ground floor behind and to the sides of the reception and massage area.  I didn't stay very long.  Usually I have my normal routine at a gym but I'm pregnant right now and so I kinda walked around not knowing what I could/should do.  After only a short while, I went back downstairs and talked to 'Lauren' who was behind the reception desk.  She was very helpful!  She gave me a schedule of classes and recommended the yoga classes to help with my pregnancy fitness needs.  I felt a lot less anxiety after I talked to her.  haha    See ya there!

This dollar store is a cute lil gem tucked in the back of the Fry's Shopping center.  I just moved into this neighborhood last week so I stopped in on part of my 'get to know the area' walking tour.  Lemme just tell you... this place has great deals!  And ex... Rubbermade tupperware that would cost $$ at any other store is only $1 here.  Picture frames that run you $5 and up at other stores are only $1 here.  I also got a silicon rubber spatula for only $1.    This store isn't good for all of your needs but it's fun to browse for cheap holiday decorations, party supplies, kitchen gadgets, and more.   See ya there!

Dairy Queen = nostalgic yum for me.  This location has a drive-thru, which makes it easily accessible nostalgic yum so it's even better than some!  I've actually never been inside.    So, why 5 stars?  They have the star pops when some others don't!!! Ye-ah!  Also, their pecan caramel chocolate thingy is Packed with pecans.    See ya there!

What can you say about Trader Joe's?  It's a great store in most ways but a lil lacking in some.  I almost always have to supplement my shopping days with a trip to another grocery store when I go here but, I still love it.  It's got the best in whole, organic foods.    I like the idea of this store and have tried many new things from their shelves.  Some of my favorites are the TJ's Greek yogurt, Puffin's Peanut Butter cereal, and their mochi ice cream!  See ya there!

Ok, so Filiberto's is my kinda joint.  It's open 24 hours and has tasty, inexpensive food.  It reminds me a lot of my favorite Mexican joint in Vegas, Roberto's.  I stopped in at a lil after 11pm the other night and got a Chicken Chimichanga.  I played some old school Pacman while I waited a very short time for it and when I got it, it was delicious.  I loved how the chicken was well seasoned and had a lil spiciness to it. :)  The beans and rice were also good.  I'll definitely be back.    See ya there!

Tott's is a good local Chinese joint.  It's got cute decor, tasty food and reasonable prices... what more do you need?    It's especially cool that they offer food 'your way'... which basically means your choice of meat, tofu or veggies in any noodle, rice, brown rice, fried rice combination.  It's good stuff.    See ya there!

Yum, I love Little Buddah.  It's one of my favorite restaurants ever and, it offers my favorite Sea Bass entree ever.  I used to frequent this trendy, tasty joint when I lived in Vegas and now that I'm reduced to tourist, I have to be happy just going on every trip.    The restaurant itself is an aesthetic treat and will impress any date.  They have a large buddha statue that looks over a front round sunken dining area as well as more dining in the back.  I prefer eating up front.  The music is also always topic of conversation as they always play the most interesting and provoking music.  The sushi is always fresh and delish, my liquid center chocolate cake is always  to die for AND... the sea bass is always the favorite dish ordered from all the friends choices.  Go with the Bass...  Because all of this is also reasonably priced for such great food and beautiful restaurant, I'm giving 5 stars!  It's usually less than 100$ for 2 people before tip... if you don't drink. haha  See ya there!

Wow... this place is crazy cool.  They have so many different learning tools... parents and teachers could spend hours in here and not soak everything in.  We kinda did, actually... spend at least an hour there!    We searched out 'Learning Is Fun' because my friend was in from Japan and wanted some workbooks to take back with her.  She's an English tutor there but it's harder to get what she needs in Japan.  She was sooo happy to have the amazing selection that this store offered.    It's just a great large learning supply store with a lot of selection.  See ya there!

M&M world is a cool place to visit when you're in Vegas... even if you're not nuts about M&M's.  I used to take all my tourist friends there and now that I'm a tourist myself, I still visit occasionally.    There are 4 stories of M&M stuff and candies.  My favorite part though is when you ride up the escalator, you can see how all the old M&M characters used to look, from the beginning to current designs.  I guess I'll take away a star though cause, I've never actually bought anything there!   Weird...  See ya there!

I love me some Blueberry Hill... they never let me down.  This is a real diner... looks like it could've come outta the 70's even. haha  Anyway, I used to go to UNLV and live so close to this location, so it's a favorite of mine.  They have an extensive menu that offers dinner on one side and all-day breakfast on the other.  They make everything from scratch.  Everything I've had here was excellent.  And finally, large portions for reasonable prices 24 HOURS A DAY... what more could you want?!?!  I almost always get the Waitress Special, which is a Belgian Waffle that melts in your mouth like clouds.  I like their sausage links with it... and over-medium eggs.  *sigh*  If I'm not in the mood for breakfast however, I'll get their grilled cheese sandwich with chili... nom nom nom.  And their carrot cake rocks!  Wish they had a Blueberry Hill in S. Bay...  See ya there!

This was my tanning salon of choice when I lived in Vegas.  They offer clean, comfortable facilities and competitive pricing.  The best thing about Neon Sun though, was always their beds.  I have very fair skin that can tan (Irish/Italian heritage) and they have a bed that is perfect for me.  It's called the Sunsport and it's a high pressure, low burn bed.  It helped me build a base tan, and then a nice golden tan as safely as possible.    Thanks Neon Sun.   If I still lived in Vegas, I'd be back.  Sadly, won't see ya there.

After hearing so much about Dos Molinos.. I was disappointed to say the least.    First let me mention that the front door is on the side of the building.   Next, don't let them put you into that first table, which is incredibly tiny, especially if you're 7 months pregnant and eating with 3 men!  I'm only 5'2" but my belly was literally up against the table.  The guys were super squished too... so I had us move as there were plenty of other tables.  In trying to get out of the little booth, I sliced my finger on the staples that hold the fabric backing onto the wood chair back... nice.  They should fix that.  And... that should be the LAST table they sit people at.    Let's move on...  Service was slow but we finally ordered.  I got the chicken chimichanga and a side of guac.  Well, I tried to get a side of guac but they brought us an appetizer of guac (which is more $$ of course).  That might have been ok since there were 4 of us but, it was terrible.  Really?  Yes... 4 hungry people and we didn't make a dent in our appetizer of guacamole.  It was somewhere in between an avocado (which I love) and guacamole (which I love) but somehow was still disappointing.  My chicken chimichanga had good flavor but there wasn't much to it.  The size was ok but it was basically just a deep-fried tortilla that was stuffed with chicken.  Meh... I'm over this place.  Maybe you have to come for the spicy food but I'm restricted on that right now because I'm preggo.  Won't see ya there!

The Lotus of Siam will have 401 reviews after I finish writing this... that means it doesn't really need my props (already has 4 stars) but, it's SO DELICIOUS that I have to write a Yelp up anyway.    It's my favorite Thai in all of Vegas... kinda in all of the USA.  My friend and I stopped in when we were up last week and, I wanted to return again the next night so I could order the same thing... the green curry.  Her pad thai was good too but, it had nothing on my green curry.  This was my first time trying it.  Everything I try there is always delicious.  It's so delicious and still really reasonably priced.    Eater beware: they do spice the Thai way so be careful when you say 'medium'... you better mean spicy!  Definitely definitely see ya there!

Why is it that every time I end up at this hole-in-the-wall, hard-core, alt rock bar/saloon, I'm dressed like a lollipop?  I'm definitely no alt rock chick but, still... lol  Oh well, I guess it's just the kinda place that we end up at instead of making a destination and dressing for.    Hole-in-the-wall Cool bartender w/ stiff drinks Crazy bands/people/spray painted wall  This is as good as it gets if you wanna find a spike-wearing, porn playing, screaming band kinda bar.  See ya there!

Today rocked... why?  Because I got to go and shoot off an H&Kmp5, an AK 47, and a M249 SAW.  heehee.  Yes yes, I do have a bit of a bruise on my shoulder now but, it's worth it!    I like being on a range like that.  The smell of the gun powder took me back to basic training days... *sigh*.  Now, people pay hundreds of dollars for what the military PAID ME to be trained for.  LoL  Guess I kinda took it for granted then... After rental fees, it's @ a buck a bullet depending on your weapon of choice, btw.  The staff at The Gun Store was nice enough; authoritarian when needed for safety but customer friendly at times also.  I know these weapons experts must get a little irritated with all the eager and under-educated tourists who come in to blast off a machine gun, but they do well in not showing it.    All in all it was a cool experience.  I have to take a star away though cause it's SO expensive.  And I mean WOW expensive for the time you spend at it.  Meh... still a good thing to try at least once.    Might see ya there!

Hate hate hate... the only reason it gets 2 stars is cause Caesar at the door was cool enough to let us in though my boyfriend and I were late for our 'group of 20'... afterwards I wished he hadn't and we'd have run off to some other venue.  Once we got in (after paying 30$ though we weren't supposed to), it was wall-to-wall people... 2 house vodka cranberries were 24$ before tip and... did I mention you couldn't move, let alone dance?  Not cool.    Won't see ya there.

The Fix is a nice place to grab a seat and people watch if you're waiting on something or someone at the Bellagio.  I tried their cucumber martini and it was delicious.    Service, however, while nice to look at, was not so great.  The girls were quick with the menus when you sat down but then forgetful about the details.  Also, drink prices were up to new Vegas standards... about $15 a drink.  It is what it is... an expensive highend casino bar.  I liked my drink, which is what's most important.  Might see ya there.

Wow, what a disappointment this place was.  We went there because my friend was once a regular (at the old location) but we quickly realized that things had taken a turn.  Sure, the place looks good and there is cool outdoor seating but, that's about it.    I'll keep this short.  Don't expect what's listed in the ingredients to actually be on your roll.  Don't expect your rolls to compare in size or taste with other sushi joints.  Don't expect ingredients to be super fresh.  Expect to be charged a pretty penny.  Won't see me there.

China King is another one of the Phoenix area treasures that makes me not miss the SF Bay Area so much.  I went for Dolores G's UYE back in Dec and was rewarded with good company and tasty dim sum.  I arrived a lil late so I didn't try all of the dishes but, I made sure to get my favorites.  They were mostly above average and definitely good for what I expected in this area.  There were lots of Asians/Asian-Americans dining at China King when we were there too.  Weird but, that always makes me feel better about an Asian restaurant.  Plus, I like the scenery.  hehe  The bill for our large group was only $10 per person.  I'm planning to go back again soon with my roomie. He needs to be introduced to dim sum!  See ya there!

Delicious!  Joe's is the best BBQ that I tried in AZ.  I loved all their selections because they have something for everyone, from ribs to giant baked potatoes.  There is really not much I can say that the other reviewers have't said though so I'll just leave it with a 2 thumbs up!   Oh, and I love the old tractor that's inside. haha  It's a classic... a 1948 A Series tractor.  Tad, the owner told me so! :)  See ya there!

Nice looking to trick u into a way expensive experience... $15 for a tequila sunrise and a soda!  Seriously?  Not worth it as the bartenders weren't friendly, the bar had nothing to hold our interest and crowd wasn't very fun. We even sat on the rail to watch the casino traffic but were still bored.   Our overall $experience$ here and it walking around made it so we probably won't even come back to the MGM next time we're in town.  It was a waste of time for us.  We don't mind paying Vegas prices when it's worth it but...  Won't see ya there.

Today, I went grocery shopping and was going to make up a nice, light dinner for my roommate, C, (it was his birthday) but instead, we ended up at VinciTorio's restaurant. Well, I have to say... it was delicious, just as he promised it would be!  As we walked into the restaurant, I was greeted by both a nice hostess and... the alluring smell of fresh baked bread.  As I looked around, I saw a lovely, cozy restaurant and... a man hand-making pasta!  (I made sure to order from the fresh pasta part of the menu.)  The pleasantness continued as the dinner wore on.  Our server was extremely polite and efficient, the bread and my lasagna were great and C really enjoyed his dish too.  I forgot what it was called but it's from the owner's part of Italy and has a lot of bell peppers. haha.   By the end, we had nice left-overs to take home and were still too full for dessert.  Ah well, maybe next time!  Oh and, dinner for 2 with non-alcoholic drinks was just under $40 before tip. :-)  See ya there!

3.5 stars.    Mac's is a cute little neighborhood grill that offers up some big screens to watch the game, good food and a decent selection of beer.  It did take a while to get our food but if you're absorbed by the game, it's really no big deal.  Maybe the cooks are into the game too. haha  I'd recommend the mushroom burger.  It was pretty tasty!  Might see ya there.

This is the best Roberto's in Vegas.  I have tried many and I think the one by campus is the most generous with cheese, guacamole, sour cream, etc.  It's a lil hole-in-the-wall but it's open 24 hours and has great, cheap food... relatively fast.  Can't beat that!    When I lived in Vegas, I used to go here at least once a week.  Sometimes more!  Try the Horchata too. It's a Mexican rice drink (with a lil cinammon).  It's yummy and good for the stomach if you've been drinking!

Yum yum... I *heart* Waffle House!   It's cheap, fresh food, fast... 24 hours a day.  What's not to like?  Sure, sometimes it's a lil greasy but, it's not as bad as some and in a 24 hour breakfast joint like this, a lil grease is to be expected.     Trust me and try the biscuits and gravy (gluttony) or plain grilled chicken sandwich (healthier)... they delish!  That being said, they have a pretty good salad, if you're ever in an no-grease mood while at Waffle House. And don't get the waffles... they're weirdly one of the worst things on the menu!  Good people watching and juke box selections at this location... especially as it's right next door to a strip club!  Woot woot!  See ya there!

Wow... this place, Urban Cookies, was designed for indulgence!  Really... how can one go wrong with a cute lil bakery that specializes in cookies and cupcakes?  The only problem you'll encounter here is making up your mind on which to choose.    I went with the Carrot Cake cupcake and it was delicious... even the frosting was top notch!  I also sampled lil bites from my friends choices and all were good.    Not sure if I'd come here often as it's not so good on the waistline but I believe in balance and this place will definitely fit onto my 'cheat days' list!  I've been to other places that were good but didn't make the cut... Urban Cookies and I have a date really soon, however!  See ya there!

Cool shop... spent some time looking through at all their high powered machinery.  Then I got realistic and moved on to the handgun section.  They have the Glock I want for a reasonable price.    I can understand why people would be put-off by the service though.  A group of guys were sitting on the couches and hollered to us to let them know if we needed some help.  It was a weekend and there was a handful of people in there but most were going without help.  Only one guy was actually up and helpful.  Ocean was his name, I think.    All-in-all, it's a sweet shop and I may be back.    Might see ya there!

While I have not taken part in the services this center offers, I wanted to give a shout-out because they were cool enough to host a La Leche League meet here a while back. :)  Thank-you!  It's a little complicated to find their suite in the office complex so be sure to get precise directions before your appt!  Might see you there.

Yesterday I can by here after 4pm and they were a bit busy. After a nice staff guy opened the door for me, I got in line to get a money order... Only to realize I didn't know exactly how much my passport fees were. (Sigh) So I left. Came back today at 11:10 and there was hardly a line. Thy offers me a bottle of water and my son found a coloring table. What great considerations! Top it off with free money orders and now, they get a 5-star review!   See ya there!

Peter Piper Pizza is a kid's dream lunch or dinner destination and easy on a parent's wallet.  It's got a mediocre but good enough pizza buffet that's really reasonably priced and a big kid play area with video games and misc activities.  The staff there is mostly teenage kids but they're patient enough with the little ones.  I enjoyed my time here.  I wouldn't say it's the cleanest place but then, it's hard to be constantly cleaning up after billions of kids. haha  Might see you here!

Reduce, reuse... good ideas to live by.  Well, last weekend, my roomie and I were reducing our book collection and decided to take 2 Trader Joe bags of books into Bookmans so someone else could reuse them.  We dropped them off at the front and then browsed the store while they figure out our exchange rate... cool right?  Well... kinda.  The problem was that, even though a lot of our books were cool travel books and fiction reads, they said they only wanted  2 books from both of our very full bags!  Then they ask if we wanted to donate the rest.  We said sure but, I might go back in later to see if our books were really donated to a cause or if they were donated to the Bookmans cause.  Seems weird that they only wanted 2 books out of about 20 books.  That was a $7 credit.    Oh, and I'd recommend going to exchange on a weekday, not Sat or Sun.  They were way busy in the exchange dept. and then we put the books we'd picked out down and left because they had a HUGE check-out line and only 1 register going.  Really?    This was my first experience and I think it ruined me.  In general the store was well organized, has a lot of variety of books and other media, has a cafe and, has comfy chairs to rest in... but I'm not sure I'll ever be back, even to use the credit.  So... I guess we 'donated' all of our books, which is fine so long as they're actually donated.    Prolly won't see ya there.

This U-Haul has great customer service and a good truck options!  Andy took really great care of me, even though his store was being repainted and worked on when I was there.  He set me up with a hitch and trailer but then referred me to another location so I could get my hitch on quicker (his garage was being worked on).    I really appreciated the help and I'd 110% recommend this location.  They made my stressful move a lot nicer.  See ya there!

"The Street" is such a cool place and it has delicious boba tea, smoothies, and other drink options.  When you walk in, you'll be surrounded by a cool vibe and customer driven wall 'art'.  It would definitely be a cool place for kids and youth to hang out... but not a joint for a high maintenance date. haha    My lil boy had been bugging me for a week, saying he wanted some Boba.  We are from the SF Bay Area so Boba is extremely easy to come from up there.  It took me several attempts to find a good boba place but finally, thanks to Yelp, we found The Street.  We got lucky, too.  Though their hours say they close at 8pm, sometimes boba places will stay open a bit later, as demanded by traffic flow.  So, even though it was after 8, I called and sure enough, they were still open.  LUCK!  If you are craving boba and it's after hours, a 30 second phone call might make your night.  The lady behind the counter was super nice, too.  I'll have to ask her name next time.    And they have Korean shaved ice - BING SOO!  I almost forgot to mention that.  Bingsu    Pro tip - ask for half sugar if you don't like things too sweet.  This is possible in some, but not all drinks and desserts.  We are so glad there's good Boba in the Mesa / Tempe area!  See ya there!

Wow... I'd heard about take-n-bake pizza a long time ago but was never interested enough to try it.  Wrong move!  After trying it for the first time a bit more than a month ago, I've now had it 3 times already.  It's good stuff!.. and super reasonably priced!  My favorite is the super thin crust pizza with ham and mushrooms.  I'm simple, I know.  I've had many others types though now and they're all good.  Plus, this was the best thing to have on hand for a party we just had at our house.  We just went and picked up 5 large in different varieties and kept them in the fridge to bake up as people arrived.  Everyone loved them!  Another great thing about this Tempe location is that the staff is so nice.  They're really great at making your experience a happy one. :)  See ya there!

Hmm, this place is hit and miss.  The first time or two that I went to Boba Tea House I was pretty pleased with it but... guess I was getting lucky.  I've noticed in my last visits that sometimes, the boba is soggy and the tea weak.  One time, I blamed it on the late hour but I don't go late very often.  I started asking for 'light ice' in my tea because you never know if it's going to be weak or not but, after this last trip, I think I'll just find another place to get my boba fix. I really can't stand mushy smushy tapioca pearls!   It's too bad since it's close to my house and a nice place to sit and visit with a friend.  I like the aquarium and couches that they have...  Prolly won't see ya there.

Hmm, I've been back a few times in 2016 and have to say, I'm having better luck with the quantity of boba. The tea is still a bit weaker than I like but overall, it's good for the limited options in the East Phoenix valley. 3 stars  So why the 4 star upgrade? Because I have a 5-year old and he and his BFF absolutely love the rainbow slush with green apple jelly and strawberry popping bubbles. LoL They have talked me into coming back the last three weeks for their fix. Best thing is that the team at Boba Tea House team will split a large size into two cups for them, just like Jamba Juice does! No kid needs a full sized cup of sugar water (with sugar popping balls and jellies). Haha  Probably see ya there!

Mesa's Gateway Airport is a lil airport that's a lil off the beaten path but might be worth the drive if you are looking for a relaxing airport experience or can benefit with the low fares and small town destinations of airlines like Allegiant.  I certainly liked it on my last trip and would recommend it to someone looking less crowds and walking.  See ya there!

Where on Earth can you get a double scoop waffle cone for only $3.50? You guessed it... Frutilandia. Other favorite included a delicious ceviche tostada for $3.75 and their various aquas naturales for $2.75 or $3.50. This is a fun place to stop.  It's a Mexican dessert shop with a lot of interesting options that you may not ever find if you only go to one style of dessert shop.  My 2-year old, my parents, all my friends and I love it.  Because the prices are good and the quality is nice, we stop there frequently instead of only occasionally.   Frutilandia has brightly painted walls, some games and music going.  It's good for the whole family or maybe even a date that you've been out with a few times already. See ya there!

This lake is a hidden lil gem... well, I'm sure it's well-known to people who have lived in the Phoenix area for a long time but we stumbled across it yesterday while driving around, taking pictures of cacti.  (yeah - i know)  It's so cute and quaint.  Not a big lake or major water sports destination but, it has a lil restaurant and a marina... and yesterday it was a nice destination and provided some great photos.    I'll return this summer!. :)  See ya there!

Von Hanson's in N.Chandler (near the Gilbert boarder) - it's a name to remember for quality meats, tons of cool liquors, spices and rubs, and many other things.    I've been trying to change my bad habit of shopping big box stores and in doing so, have found many excellent local businesses like Von Hanson's Meats & Spirits.  It's been a lesson in life.  The upgrade in meat alone is worth the switch but the personal service you get when shopping Von Hanson's makes the extra drive completely worth it.  It turns out though, you don't even have to drive to get their products anymore.  They now feature the new Phoenix local delivery service called Pikfly.  It's so cool.  If you're having a party and run out of something, or just don't feel like leaving the house, Pikfly will pick up Von Hanson's (and many other local business products) and deliver right to your door.      So there's thousands of products packed into this little market but here's some examples of what you can get at this delicious meat shop... brats of many different meats and interesting ingredient combinations, steaks, smoked sausages, pork spare ribs, lamb shanks, capon, turkey, duck, beef short ribs, cornish game hens, hanger steaks, ground veal, pork chops, hamburger, buffalo patties, ground elk, chicken, brat patties, certified Angus beef, grill-ready meats, rubs, spices, BBQ sauces, speciality woods chips and logs (like cherry or sassafras) to burn in your grill.... little desserts like peanut butter crispy bites, deli salad stuff, cheese curds, specialty sodas, beer, liquor, wine... and even some beans to throw into the pot.  Ok, that's all I've got to say about that.  You can probably figure by now that I'm a fan.  The fact that I can get their stuff delivered by Pikfly now... well, that's just icing on the cake.  See ya there!

Wow, they've really been changing things down on ole Fremont St.!  It seems to be where most of my tourist friends feel they've 'found Vegas'.  It has the lights, the music, the showgirls, the cheap eats, the electric atmosphere... and to top it off, a recent pulley system that'll zoom you across the top of all the excitement.    I recommend hitting up the La Bayou for the frozen daiquiris (they're stronger than they taste people) and the ABC store for cool, inexpensive treats.  The California hotel has good oxtail soup and the souvenir shops in the area carry some of the best prices. :)  Have fun!  See ya there!

Gotta love a place that has 2 happy hours... even if their happy hour menu is a bit limited.  I bet this would be a great place to drink. Unfortunately, I was pregnant when I discovered it and now, I have a newborn so I'm still not drinking. haha  That said, the sushi and udon are pretty tasty and I love that they're open late-night.  Everyone that I've taken has liked it and I think it would be a good date night spot, as well.    See ya there!

If you're not looking for high-end, more expensive shopping, this mall might be a better choice for you than some of the others.  The stores are still adequate and parking is easy.  It's got a nice Best Buy store in it too.    Best thing of all though is the fun kids play area.  See ya there!

My 17year old niece visited me a couple of months back and as we were on an eating-around-the-world tour and hitting the Hidori Korean restaurant, we saw this unique looking thrift store.  It's filled with amazing goodies, and you can trust me on that because I'm not usually a huge fan of resell shops.  We started with the 3$ sidewalk sales selections and found a shirt and an adorable dress for my niece!  When we went in, the selections got considerably more expensive but, they were probably still worth it, just more than I was looking to spend that day.    I'd definitely go back and my niece still talks about how cool it was here.  Might see ya there!

Got beer?  No?  Need specialty beer?  This BevMo might be your spot.  There have been more than a couple of times when a  seasonal specialty was at the end of it's run and my roommate can only find it at this location.  Of course, they you're SOL because we'll buy all that's left on the shelf. haha  Might see ya there!

Since I'm from Missouri, home of the largest Bass Pro, I always have to check-out Bass Pros in other areas.  This location was one of my favorites. It's very large and has a great selection of all your outdoor gear and clothing need.  Need a boat?  They got it!  Unique gifts?  No problem.  Camping gear... look no further!  (sigh)  I love this store!  It's sure to be a kid pleaser too.  It has giant aquariums and animals all over.  It even has a giant waterfall and lil river running through the store. :)  I've actually been a few times since I moved here.  It's nostalgic for me and when I get homesick I just swing by and buy something I probably don't need. haha  See ya there!

Jasmine Thai is by my girl friends house and when I visit her in Las Vegas, we inevitably end up here... our little, hard-to-find-ifyadontknowit Thai nook.  It's just a cute lil restaurant with average/good Thai cuisine and a friendly staff.  They serve their Pad Thai noodles a lil more sweet than I prefer but my friend and her daughter love it.    This last time I wasn't feeling well so I ordered their wonton soup and it was sooo good.  I would definitely order it again.  I'll post a picture of it so you can see the amazing chicken, shrimp, slices of pork, veggies and wontons that completely filled my small bowl!  The broth was so tasty too, just what my sensitive tummy needed.  See ya there!

Love it!  This is such a weird lil theater.  My girl friend and I stopped in to catch a chick flick after eating at Yupha's Thai restaurant... I was pleasantly surprised at the low cost and crazy decor.  They've got it all set-up for Halloween right now so it's pretty interesting!    Anyway, to make a long review short... $3 a movie?  Can't beat that.    See ya there!

Yuck yuck yuck... I can't believe this place has good reviews.  It must be because a majority of the reviews are written by people who stop here after a night out of drinking.    The other night I was craving some Mexican food and instead of going to the other Mexican joint that's less than a block away, I decided to try Amados.  Big mistake.... huge.  Sure, it's open 24 hours but, so is the competitor around the corner... and they offer tasty food!  My chicken chimichanga plate was gross on a buncha levels,  First off, it's obvious the oil hadn't been changed in a while because I could SMELL the deep-fried tortilla... and not in a good way.  After a test bite or two, I decided I'd just eat the chicken inside but, it was SOOO SALTY that I literally ended up throwing most of it out.  I have never ever done that to a chimichanga before.  :(  Finally, the beans and rice had almost no flavor.  I don't even know how that's possible... rice sure.  Beans tho?!    Because of the 4 stars I was thinking I should give it another try but honestly, just can't stomach the idea of it.    Won't see ya there!

Got back from the State Fair earlier tonight.  Ugh, food coma.   I had deep-fried everything: oreo's, cheese curds, funnel cakes, corn dogs... and a grilled corn that was drenched in butter.  It was all delicious and since I split everything with 2 other friends... I'm not feeling sick. haha  BTW, it wasn't ghetto.  Everyone said it's have crazy gang people but, I didn't see any of that and we stayed until just before close.  I never felt uncomfortable.    I did miss the local exhibits, animals and farm stuff that I'm used to from other state fairs.  The kids display and cakes in the stadium building is cool though.    I'd definitely go back.  See ya there!

Hungry?  Thirsty?  Lazy?  In need of sexy scenery?    Well, there's a one-stop shop for all your needs down in Chandler, AZ.  It's called, Heart Attack Grill and lemme tell ya, it lives up to it's name.  You can take care of your hunger with a double, triple, or quadruple bypass burger and an all-you-can-eat French fry bar, ease your thirst with an old-fashioned coca-cola straight outta the glass bottle (from Mexico even so it's real sugar), and even get your lazy butt wheeled out to your car by sexy nurse waitresses after you've finished (if you order the giant burger)!   What could go wrong you ask?  Well, very little, imo.  I went to Heart Attack grill fully expecting a greasy, over-the-top experience and I was not let down.  First impression, the bright red and white emergency motif, nurses in cute uniforms, good oldies kinda music and powerful smell of... lard? LoL  My friend and I both ordered the single bypass burger, cokes and he got the all-you-can-eat fries (no sharing allowed but that's ok because it's cheap - 1.85 per person).  Our burgers came out a little while later and lemme tell ya, even the buns were coated in grease.  I noticed not everyone had that slick shiney bun though so people in the know must order without the extra juice.  Really, I could've done without the extra slippery lard buns but other than that, it was a decent burger and a fun experience.  Things I liked - the old videos playing on flat screens above me, the waitresses who bent over while talking to other customers so I could check out their bootays, the almost all female staff (only 1 male), and the funny sad fact that anyone over 350lbs eats for free.  Gross.  Things I didn't like - it was pretty messy... I guess cute cosplay waitresses don't really clean as well as regular waitresses do, the waitresses could've been more curvy (of course I like girls a lil think anyway), the greasy buns that fall apart a lil while u try to eat em, AND... the funny sad fact that anyone over 350lbs eats for free.  Gross.  If I lived in Arizona, I'd probably go every once in a while, just for fun and of course, to entertain guests.  Not a good date spot. LoL  The manager guy was really nice though... he even played 'California Lovin' for me over the flat screens.  I told him if he opens a joint in Tokoyo, I'll go be 'head nurse' for him!    Another cool thing, starting in October, they're going to have a live band on Saturday's from 2-7.   I guess some of the guys in the band have history with Alice Cooper and kinda with Metallica.  Neat.  I'll be back to AZ in November and I'll have to come by and check it out again.    See ya there!

Want Chinese take-out or a quick lunch spot?  Hong Kong Express might be your spot!  They have many pre-made selections to choose from and a menu that offers many quickly made Chinese favorites.  Despite this convenient quickness and good prices, the food is still pretty good!  I'm a big fan of their preserved pork and egg congee.  Yum!    Hong Kong express is located inside the Chinese center grocery store.    See ya there!

Dammmmn, I'm so glad I'm in Vegas right now cause I shot off some machine guns today and tomorrow, I get to go to DJ Bibigkahan for lunch!    It's my birthday and I'm in Vegas... now I get to have the best Filipino food at the most amazing prices ever!  This place is SO much better than the other Filipino options, I only tried the others 1 time and never went back.  It isn't a 'nice' restaurant but it's quick, cheap and DELISH!  See ya there!

I'm sorry, I hate to do this but, I'm 95%sure DJ's gave me food poisoning last Sat.  The reason I know... cause I'm the only one who ate the squid... everything else through-out the day was shared family-style with my friends.  I was sick, sick, sick... you don't want details.  Also, they've raised their prices... a lot.  I was bragging to all my friends about how great DJ's was and how it'd only run us 5-6$ per person... almost everyone spent @ 10$.  :*(   Plus they were 'out' of our favorite orange soda.  Nobody else really complained but, what a wreck of a group lunch outing!  DJ's let me down in several ways.  Won't see ya there anymore!

L&L rocks.  I don't care what anyone else says, I love this place!  You get tasty food for good prices in large portions... people who complain about that should go and review a higher-end, more expensive joint.    My recommendations is that you go with spam musabis, chicken and/or seafood/fish plates and avoid the beef as it can be a bit salty and is styled after but isn't as tasty as my #1 love, Korean BBQ.    I like that they make your order fresh for you when you order but it's still pretty fast and inexpensive.  I wish they had an L&L where I live now!  See ya there!

The Super L Ranch Market is an example of a clean, well-stocked Asian grocery store.  The prices seem to be about the same as the other Asian grocers in the Phoenix area and their selections are fresh and well-rounded.  I tend to buy my veggies and meats at Asian grocery stores and stop by this one when I'm in the area.  I also really like the take-out from the Hong Kong Express restaurant that's located in this grocery store, on the right side.  Might see ya here!

Reduce, reuse and recycle... I'm trying to embrace this way of life more as I get older.  I used to run out to the local bookstore to buy a book that I'd heard about... now I always make sure to check my local library first (call or go online to do so).  That being said, Chandler's Sunset Branch is a great little library that is free free free!  In addition to books, they also have fun activities for kids, such as story time and baby sign language.  These activities run on a schedule though and often take breaks when the kids are on break so make sure to check the library calendar!     Might see ya there!

For my 700th review, I'm gonna yelp about the thrills and sexiness at the W hotel's Halloween affair.  Loved it!  Even in my current position as permanent designated driver, I had a great night soaking in the music, comfort and local talent.      Let's start with the club itself... it's a outside venue that shows off a sexy swimming pool and different levels of bars.  You have a lot of depth... one level will be a cozy, partially inside bar and the next will be a sand box of cabanas, with a bar.  My recommendation, unless you like $12 mixed drinks, avoid the center bar as they only serve top-shelf selections.  The side bars are much more reasonable... and you can get a $5 beer at any of them.      Next up, the crowd... I'm not sure how it is on a regular bar night but for the Halloween party, there was some serious hotness walking around.  The ladies especially.  Plus, when we first got there, the ladies definitely outnumbered the guys.  Not sure how it was later in the night as it got a lil too crowded to tell.  Another thing I liked was that it was a mid-20's and 30's kinda crowd with few annoying youngsters.  And finally... loved the music.  It started with smoother beats that bled into crowd rockin' club hits.  We especially liked that they threw some 'funny' and old stuff in occasionally.  :)  The party had other cool perks such as a fun, free photo booth and an easy will-call set-up.  Thanks W... we had a great Halloween night and will definitely be back!    See ya there!

In the Tempe area and need a tasty quick lunch with the bonus of tasty sweets?  Then Wildflower Cafe might be your spot.  I've been twice now and have enjoyed everything I've had.  Today, I got the grilled chicken pesto sandwich and it was tasty.  I actually like everything about it - mushrooms, red peppers, cheese, chicken breast, and bread.  Last time, I got a soup and sandwich combo and it was tasty too.  Both times, the lemon bar has been great!!  Even though I don't live in AZ, I'd recommend Wildflower for a quick, reasonably priced lunch.  Might see ya there.

I kinda dig this place. Tasty $17 all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ... sign me up!   The price is right and the meats are better than you'd expect.  Pretty good, actually!  They have galbi (ribs), and bulgogi (thinly  sliced beef) and oh jing oh (squid), and shrimp and and and... a selection of prepared foods and some sushi.  I've been here a few times now and am always glad I came to eat.  Last time, I was with a big group of friends (about 10) and everyone liked it.  Just know that you'll smell like Korean bbq for the rest of the day, unless you head home to take a shower afterwards.  :)  See ya there!

This place is pretty tasty and has great happy hour specials!     The 2 high lights of my visit, imo, were the awesome chorizo mac'n'cheese and sitting on the small but nice patio. My chicken nachos were good too but I just kept stealing my friend's mac'n'cheese... next time, I know what to order!  Nice, clean, trendy atmosphere, and our server was nice and cute.    See ya there!

Imagine this... a delicious, flaky pie crust that's been stuffed with delicious stew like middles.  Yum... making you hungry?  It should be!  This is the kinda cuisine that the Cornish Pasty Company serves up.  And they do it well.  Really well.  So well in fact that I've told my friends in California about this place and we try, in vain, to find something similar in the Bay area.  ((sigh))  Please CPC, come to Sunnyvale, California!  Aside from the tasty food and reasonable prices, this is a joint with unique music and appeal.  It's a cool place for a date though maybe a lil loud for a meeting of any kind.  They have an outdoor patio and inside seating... and a well stocked bar!  I'd definitely recommend Cornish Pasty House to friends and in fact, will have to visit again really, really soon.  See ya there!

So maybe I'm not a big fan of the Navajo or Native American foods that I've tried since moving to AZ. I haven't been tempted to return to any of the 3 restaurants I've tried of it so far.  I bet Native home-cooking would be better... any volunteers?! :)  The only thing I like is the frybread dessert and... who wouldn't like that?!  The other foods I've tried seem to be either very bland or tooooo spicy.  The hominy soup I tried here was pretty bland.  Won't see you there.

Tasty fro-yo and super fresh toppings!  Wish I'd have logged into Yelp to see their special offer... oh well.    $0.42 an ounce here... bit more than other places but I'm sure it's because of the location.  See ya there!

After visiting Anna's Garden a few times on 2 trips to Vegas in the last 3 months, I can firmly say 'two thumbs up'.  Each time I've gone has been a completely different experience.  (I suggest going for lunch before or after the typical lunch rush hours.)  The 1st time was with a Chinese friend and his parents.  They go every week and I was lucky enough to be invited along one time.  The 4 of us ordered 8 dishes so they could take home a bunch of left-overs for the week.  Obviously, they love Anna's... mostly because it's authentic and has no MSG!     The 2nd time was with a group of non-Asian friends, English and Latin mostly.  Again, everyone really liked their food, especially since we went for lunch and most of the dishes we ordered ended up being only $5-$6 each!  The 3rd time was with a mixed group of friends, some Asian, some not.  Again, we went for lunch, though this time I knew to go later to avoid the rush.  We arrived at 2pm and it was perfect.  Again, everyone thought it was delicious.  So all in all, I've probably tried at least 15 dishes at Anna's in the last 3 visits.  My favorite is their pan-fried noodle with chicken and veggies.  It's the hard noodle that softens when you put the sauce on it.  I used to not like that dish much, preferring rice noodles to egg noodles but ahhh, how times have changed!  See ya there!

Got kimchi?  Got bulgogi?  Got mochi?  Well... Paldo's Market does!  It's a super clean and well-organized Korean (and a bit Japanese) market that's fun to go and buy things randomly from.  There are tons of treats for the people who don't cook Asian food or high-quality imported needs for those who do.    As for me... I love to go and get treats, some basic ingredients (like meats or seafood) and... cruise around looking at all the cute Korean guys. keke  It's even better when they've just come from the LA Fitness that's next door.  *sigh*  See ya there!!!

Mr Goocents has the best bread, so they make the best sub.  That's my take, after more than a decade of trying all the sub shops around.  I am also a big fan of their soups, which are usually broccoli cheddar (my 4-year old's favorite) and chicken noodle (my favorite).  They also stock Sun Chips (bonus) and have the cool soda machine where you can make any soda any flavor... grape Sprite?  No problem?    What's not to love?  They're cheap, they're easy and they're good.  :-)  See ya there!

Hmm... wasn't so impressed with Francis and Sons wash service last Tue.  I got the deluxe wash and carpet shampoo for a pretty good price ($50) but when I got my car back, the wheels still have dirt in almost all of  the corners on the rim.  To be sure it wasn't just stubborn dirt, I got down and wiped it with my finger... it came off easily.  Then, one of the inside panels in front, which were supposed to be all wiped down, still had visible goo all over it from my nephews chocolatey hands.    The outside looked shiny and fresh and car smelled good for days but, I think if I go again, I'll only opt for their base price services.  For $50, I expected more...   Might see ya there.

Wow... I'd been avoiding stores that were specifically directed at maternity wear under the false assumption that they'd be way more expensive.  I was wrong.    A friend and I stopped in this Tempe Marketplace Motherhood Maternity today and I was so surprised to see things were often less expensive than they were at Target's maternity section!  Jeans for example, started at $30 regular price.  All nursing bras were under $20 from what I could tell... I was pretty impressed.  They even have a pretty large clearance section in the back. :)  They also have some trendy selections, including jackets, jeans and sweaters.  Most of my stuff I'm buying used from mothers online or at Craigslist (better for the environment and my pocketbook) but for those special items and the occasional trendy new piece, I'll definitely be back!  See ya there!

Thank-you Buybuy Baby, for having a well-educated staff, a great selection of baby gear and, a quiet, comfortable room that mothers can nurse in.    True story... one day, my little guy was unusually fussy and I was getting a little stressed out because I was out, trying to run some much needed errands.  I was still shy on the idea of nursing in public but in my frazzled, stressed state, I somehow realized that I was close to this Buybuy Baby and hoped they would have a private area to nurse in.  They did!  They have a room set-up for a mother's comfort. The lowered lights and comfortable chairs really helped me de-stress and get back to a good day.  Thank-you so much!  I'm glad that I often use you as my go-to baby supply store!  See ya there!

Going to Triad Pain Management Clinic for post automobile accident physical therapy has not only been working out the back pain that started after being rear-ended but has also relaxed and educated me on what I can do to help my body's healing process.  Even when they're uncomfortable, I enjoy the stretches, massage, exercises and conversation of each visit.  I try to pay attention because they clue me into unhealthy body habits that I have, several of which are simple to correct.  I even try to do the home tasks they assign me.  I've often thought that most people could benefit with a general evaluation of their posture and muscle movements... could make you feel better asap or even prevent future problems you don't know you're working into.    I feel comfortable going to these guys... which is nice because I the auto accident happened when I was 6 months pregnant!  They do all their work without making me feel nervous for my baby and they even put up with my pouty sleepy pregnancy days. haha      The 2 doctors I've worked with are Kerchansky  and Voisin.  They are both great at what they do and I like them both for different reasons.  I've also had massages with both of the massage therapists and though I wish the massages were longer (haha), they are relaxing and get my body ready for the stretching and exercises that follow.    In general, their office works efficiently (no waiting room waits) and has doctors with many different areas of expertise.  For example, Kerchansky has focused his career in active care, working with many sports athletes, and Viosin is certified to perform manipulation under anesthesia (MUA).  They have Spanish-speaking staff, as well.    Here's their website:  http://www.azpain.com/index.html  See ya there!

We just got a new puppy!!!  Yay!    With a new puppy comes a lot of responsibilities.  There are exams, shots, pee puddles, chewed household items, and more to deal with.  Though I can't help you with the house issues, I can recommend a nice vet that's located in Tempe - Gentle Care Animal Hospital.    So, as I'm a researcher by nature, I started reading online and calling up vet offices as soon as I got the pup.  I was comparing details like price, schedule availability, things they recommended over the phone, and online reviews.  Some other pet hospitals were almost twice the price for an initial puppy visit and shots! And Gentle Care offers the same prices as the Petco Shot clinic on all vaccinations and treatments I checked out... except the microchip, which is slightly more expensive here. And needless to say, the online reviews were great, making Gentle Care the best reviewed economical choice I found.  Scheduling was easy - we only had to wait two days for first available appointment - not bad!  Once we arrived, the vet was clear, direct, and didn't try to oversell me services.  The staff was friendly.    We'll be back for the rest of our puppy shots and a lifetime of care.  See ya there!

So today, I took my final 1st step towards taking off the last 15 pounds of 'baby weight'.  Yay me!  I figured it's about time since I've been promising myself that I'd get started on something for a while now.    My son is 2 now and for the first year of his amazing life, the extra weight didn't bother me.  After we stopped nursing, however, I started thinking it was time to slim down.  I'd love to get down to prepregnancy weight but it seems harder to take off now that I don't have youth or free time on my side.  That's where the MedShape crew are are going to help.  Today's visit was awesome.  The staff, Brittany specifically, was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Most of them are success stories, too, so they really identify with your health/weight loss goals.  They set me up with easy-to-understand nutritional guidelines and explained how everything works.  I'm super excited.    This is a medically supervised weight loss clinic so I feel more at ease.  I've never tried the herbal or over the counter stuff because... I don't trust them.  With MedShape, though, I selected an 8 week program with tons of clinic staff support... because I'm sure I'll need nudges and hellos from supportive people.    They take walk-ins but I bet an appointment is better.  Men and women were in the waiting room!  I'll check back in a few weeks to update my progress.  Woot!  And I might start a blog about it.   See ya there!

Today, my friend and I were in the mood for some easy, fast, inexpensive eats so we stopped into Yum Yum China.  I'm going to rate it for what it is... an Americanized fast-food Chinese place.  It's like Pick-up Stix or Panda but, it tasted a bit healthier and was a bit less expensive.    We (2 girls) split the 3 item combo and still had a little left-over.  My favorite was their broccoli beef.  The broccoli was crisp, not overdone like some places, and the beef was super tender.  I also liked the kung-pao chicken but beware, it's really more spicy than you might expect.  That's a good thing, imo, but my friend couldn't eat it.  Only note is that there were hardly any peanuts in it. :(  The orange chicken was, of course, sweet and tasty as well.  I'd definitely stop in again for a quick, inexpensive bite to eat!  Might see ya there!

3.5 stars  I have mixed views on Scottsdale Shea.  My Dr. recommended them for my delivery hospital (I'm 7 months pregnant) but I ended up there a few months early because some loony Phoenix driver rear-ended me in rush hour traffic.  Even though the accident was in Tempe, I was freaking out so much and insisting on Shea that they took me there.  (My Dr office had said for me to go to Shea's OB Triage when I called, after the guy hit me.)  haha    OB Triage was great.  After 5 hours monitoring my baby, I felt more calm.  I was in my own room and very comfortable... all of the staff was nice.  But then... I had to go to ER to have my accident concerns addressed.  ER was kinda crazy.  It was small, not laid out well and it didn't seem very efficient.  I was in their waiting room many additional hours even though I'd checked in with them earlier in the evening, they knew I was coming and I'd already been in the hospital for 5 hours.  There I was in a wheelchair, 6 months pregnant with a suppressed immune system... right next to other patients who were throwing-up constantly. haha  Oh well, hopefully I won't end up in their ER again...   I'm looking forward to delivery in their amazing maternity ward!  I took a hospital tour a while back and sheesh... they have a great set-up for expectant mothers!  I get my own room and my baby will stay with me the whole time, even for his first bath!  They also said I have a jacuzzi that I can use to move around in during labor.  Hope that helps!  See ya there!

My girl and I are planning a spontaneous trip to Greece so last night, we stopped into Beach Bunny Swimwear to check-out some of their swim wear.  We'd never been there and probably won't go again.    We were greeted with a loud voice from the back as we walked in and then after a few seconds, the girl behind the counter also told us that they closed in about 8 minutes, in a brisk way... not very customer friendly.  My friend teased back, telling her that she wouldn't like it if one of her employees had said that so the girl proceeded to tell us about a time she'd stayed until midnight for a client... "because ya know, they were spending thousands of dollars" but she didn't even get a raise for it.  I didn't know how to respond.  I was thinking that she must think we couldn't afford to spend thousands and/or that if her boss gave her a bit more positive reinforcement or reward for staying late, she'd be more friendly.  Either way you look at it, it was a weird story to tell.    Plus, I may be a regular salary girl but my girl friend is about to buy an Aston Martin... with her own money.   Anyway, the swim wear was cute from the window but not functional when we got up close.  They'd be good for photos, I guess.    Won't see ya there.

Jamba Juice is a healthy-ish addiction of mine.  It used to be just an addiction but when the whole calorie count on some of my old favorites came to light, I quickly switched my selections!  That's ok though... the new, healthier selections are just as delicious.    Now if they just weren't so expensive.  Good tip though, you can get a POWER size and they'll split it into 2 cups for you so you can share. :)  That's great if you and a friend or co-worker drink the same flavors.  See ya there!

My check engine light came on so after a diagnostic print-out from Auto Zone (and Checkers) I headed over to Oasis Auto Center.  They were friendly and knowledgeable and didn't try to sell me service that I didn't need.  I spoke with Johnny. :)    Now, I get my oil changes there and will probably return for any major work that's needed.  They're quick, reasonably priced and in my area!   See ya there.

It's kinda silly to review a bank but like the other Yelper who reviewed this location, I just wanted to give props to their friendly staff.  Britney helped me the other day and she was friendly and efficient!  Also, I didn't really have to wait at all, but then I went on slightly off hours.  The location is a lil tucked off the main road so don't miss it!  See ya there!

Dried mango and chocolate covered Macadamia nuts... I just love that Vegas has ABC stores.  I stop into them occasionally to load up on tasty Hawaiian treats that are hard to find elsewhere.    I also dig their (sexy) calendars for only $2.   This location is big and spacious but a bit out of the way.  I was trying to waste time while waiting for a friend when I pulled in.  Normally though, it seems like it'd just serve the condo community around it.  Still, it's nice, clean, and have a few gambling machines (for you addicts).  Also, the guy working was really nice!  Might see ya there!

My girl and I were glad to find this place after stopping at another tea joint that featured $4 and $5 boba teas... seriously?  Haha.  Anyway, #1 Boba Tea is hidden inside the corner building of the China Town plaza.  You can't see it from the parking lot.  It's worth the lil walk though as it offers up tasty milk tea and good, chewy boba.  Prices were reasonable.  See ya there!

Do you like tender, fall-off-the-bone stewed meats that are rich with flavorful spices and unique to the average palette?   If so, then you should pick a night you don't have much going on and head over to A Taste of the Caribbean.  My roomie and I have been here a handful of times and are always happy with our visit.    Things to try: Jerk Chicken Goat Curry Brown Stew Chicken Beef Patties (not sure why they call them that though) Yucca dessert - tastes coconutty!  Notes: They are on their own clock so don't be in a hurry! I wish they'd have some music playing instead of the TV all the time.  That'd match the colorful design a bit more.   Sometimes the beef patties are too dry but I like them anyway! lol  Now that I'm writing about it... I kinda wanna go again!  I wanna get their oxtail... they were in between batches when I tried to order it last time.    See ya there.

After being rear-ended on the hwy and having my truck towed to a shop, I needed a rental car.  State Farm referred me here and after setting everything up for me, an associate, Evan, came to pick me up at my house so I could get my loaner.    I visited their office 3 times during my truck's stay in the shop.  First to get the car, 2nd to cancel the voluntary insurance I'd gotten for the first day of driving a new vehicle and the 3rd to return the car.  Every time, Evan was super kind and efficient.  I'd definitely rent from Enterprise again, and hopefully this location.  Maybe next time I'll get a car just for fun!  See ya there!

Now this... is some pretty tasty Thai.  It's actually the best Thai that I've had in the Phoenix area so far.  Also, the lunch specials are great.  Lunch for my girlfriend and me was well under $20... and we both liked our food a lot!  My noodles were perfectly cooked, veggies still had some crunch to them and meat was well proportioned and tender.   I'll be back to try more dishes some day soon!  See ya there!

Wow, this place is tastiness overload!  A couple of friends and I went last week and we all liked it.  I ordered the bacon burger and had them add mushrooms... it was heaven.  I've had other gourmet burgers that were good too but, I especially like the bread bun on Zinburgers.  I was also a fan of the truffle fries... they didn't need the aoli they came with!  I don't really order sweets often but I ordered a shake too because the server was awesome enough to split it into 3 glasses for everyone at the table.   The restaurant also had a cool, trendy atmosphere which was very clean.  Our server was very polite and efficient... though the kitchen did add sauce that I ask to be substituted (it was good anyway).    So why only 4 stars?  Well, it was a very expensive lunch.  3 burgers, a shake, 2 teas, and 1 fry came to almost $60.  Be prepared!  I'd still go back but, it'll be a rare treat!  See ya there!

Republic Ramen + Noodle gave me hope.  Why?  Well, when I left the SF Bay area a while back, the thing I dreaded leaving most was all the amazing privately-owned restaurants and hidden ma-n-pa joints that serve up delicious, authentic food.  Republic Ramen soothed my fear a lil though, since they dish out a pretty tasty bowl of ramen.  In fact, their Shoya ramen is just as good as my regular order back in Cali - butter corn ramen.  (I did have to add corn to it though and would love to see a butter corn option on the Republic menu one day.)      The restaurant is clean, freshly decorated and service was efficient (order and pay at front counter, they bring your food).  Those facts, combined with the fact that the ramen was so good (and they have kimchi sides), give Republic 5 stars!  See ya there!

Empire is a fun lil beauty school in Chandler.  $5 hair cuts, $5 waxing, $12 highlights... how can you beat that?!  If you're the kind of person who isn't a perfectionist, this might be the place for you.  It does take a bit longer but it's fun to talk to the girls while they work.  Just make sure you don't have plans for your afternoon.  You'll probably get there, see the great prices and keep adding services... just like I did!  They are a full-service salon and offer things like cuts, perms, color, waxing, updo's, nail services, and more!  Check-out their website for more info. :)  If you go in, check to see if the 'hotdog guy' is out back selling hotdogs.  He makes super cool hotdogs/sausages with unique stuffings and such.  See ya there!

2 strikes, you're out.  While I can easily tolerate the lack of quality control in the procedures I get there, Empire Beauty School can't seem to get appts right... which is not acceptable.    Last time, I scheduled with my preferred student and when I got there, that student was in class and it took them over 30 minutes to find a replacement.  Then, they stuck me with a girl who gave me a pedicure that was worse than one I could have given myself or that any of my friends have ever given me.  She was nice though... probably just new at pedicure and manicures.  This happens sometimes at beauty schools and is expected.  Today, I scheduled with my same preferred student but when I got there, he was busy with another client because they had me down for an earlier time than I'd scheduled 9even though I'd called a week in advance for the appt because today I'm going to a Christmas party and wanted pretty nails for it).  I believe that confusion happened because we had originally discussed the earlier time but then, during the SAME phone conversation, I said that I'd have to get a baby sitter so I'd need the later opening. Despite that, they scheduled me for the earlier opening.  Still, I wasn't irritated until I waited OVER AN HOUR for a replacement and still had nobody.    So I left.  I looooove paying a babysitter and then showing up to messed up appt times.  I don't mind if they switch me around and things aren't perfect but today's hour wait was way too much.  An added insult is that the students at the desk had talked to their manager/teacher and she didn't care at all.  Very unprofessional... which is ok from the students but not the staff.  At this point, I cannot recommend Empire Beauty to anyone who has a schedule or has to pay a sitter while they are out.    Won't see ya there.

H&M consistantly has clothes that I like, for reasonable prices.  It's usually one of the 1st places I'll hit when I'm out shopping.  This location is much bigger than the H&Ms I've been too... it even has baby clothes!    So what was wrong?  Well, I was shopping with a guy who's a size 'L' and they barely had his size in the style and color he wanted.  Most of the things he found he couldn't get or had to choose another color in because they were out of 'L'.   I haven't shopped this location for girls as I normally shop in Cali but, I hope this doesn't happen to me too if I go back!  Might see ya there.

Wow... this is a good burger.  And this Smashburger location has deep-fried pickles!  Dangerous combination.    I really liked the simple lay-out.  You walk in, order at the counter, sit down, and they bring you your food.  Once you dig in, you get to enjoy a juicy, delicious burger with fries of your choice.  All is good!  Only problem is, it's the type of meal that makes you wanna curl up and take a nap for the rest of the day. lol  It's like a gourmet burger, but for much better prices.  See ya there!

This travel store is the perfect place to find a Christmas, birthday, misc gift for your hard-to-buy-for friends.  It also has a great selection of luggage.  They also let me find a quiet corner to nurse my baby in... which was much better than returning to a bench in the busy, public mall walkway.    5 stars!  I think the best thing was the nice (pretty) woman that worked there.  She made me want to buy lil travel trinkets.. and I did! haha  See ya there!

Boooooossssaaaaaaaaa donuts.  BOSA donuts.... this place is so good.  I don't know how it's possible but, even late at night, when I inevitably decide I need donuts, the selections here are still fresh and tasty!  I love the regular glazed, blueberry cake and lemon-filled the best... closely followed by all the others!     Drive-thru is 24 hours and the dining area is open until 10:30pm.  Also, the lady behind the counter is always so nice... makes the visit even more enjoyable.     Don't forget to grab a milk outta their cooler... goes perfect with your sweet!  And now that I've read other Yelpers reviews, I have to try their savory selections and croissants too!  I'll definitely be back... soon!  See ya there!

Small pool that was incredibly windy.  At first the staff was very helpful in locating a place for my friend and me to relax.  We even got lucky and scored the cushy lounge chair beds.    Unfortunately, things went downhill with the food.  We ordered salmon sliders, nachos and a fruit cup with berry lemonade and a coke.  The 2 sliders were way too fishy tasting (normally I love salmon) and the onion rings that came with them were pretty greasy.  We only ate 1 slider... couldn't stomach the 2nd.  The fruit cup was way too small for the price and was mostly filled with cheap melon.  The nachos were good... a little spicy and big enough to share.   Our bill... $50.  Plus tip... $60.  Not kidding.      Immediately, I realized the lemonade was way too sweet for me so I ask for some water to dilute it a little.  It never showed up.  Finally, we took it to the bar ourselves and exchanged it for a coke.  I guess our waitress had her $10 tip already so she didn't stop by again.      The wind also blew us away... almost literally.  It knocked the umbrellas over and the staff had to run around and put them all down.    I won't be staying at the Vdara again after such a junky pool experience.  There are too many other options in Vegas!  Won't see ya there!

This place needs a lil work still.  After days of wanting noodles, my roomie and I stopped in to check-out their fare.  We ate in but kinda regretted that as the service, though polite, was slow and disorganized.  Maybe it's because we got there just as the dinner hour was starting but it seemed more like the server had no experience.  Normally, I don't expect service quality from an Asian joint but normally it's rude and fast. lol  So I ordered the Mandalay noodles and my roomie had a curry noodle something.  My noodles had good flavor and the shrimp was fresh and crisp... but there were only like 3 of them.  Really?  My roomies dish had good flavor.    All-in-all, it was a disappointing experience.  I know it's new so I might try it again in a few months.  Hopefully at that time, the rating will go up thru the roof!  Might see ya there!

Tue night is dollar kids scoop night (and $1.50 big scoop)!  It starts at 6pm and goes to 10pm How can you go wrong with that?! We are going to start a Tue tradition of walking the dogs in a big circle so we can take advantage of the yummy treats! Also, the staff is super nice and the store offers many flavors of ice cream as well as sorbets, cakes, and drinks. :) There are some cute lil benches and outside seating so you can have your pets with you... pet-friendly! See ya there!

Review #800    I had to wait for a great place to feature for #800.   Enter: Parent morning movies... in a theater that offers changing tables and dim lights in addition to their ultra nice seating, VIP rooms, 21+ beverages, good food service, incredibly friendly staff, and caramel popcorn.  I'm in!!  Oh, and did I mention it's a beautiful, clean theater, too?  WHO: All mommies, daddies, and other care-givers  WHAT:  Go see a movie with your lil one!  WHEN: Wednesday mornings and occasional featured nights.   WHERE:  Listings for participating Ultra Star theaters are here... http://www.ultrastarmovies.com/parent_movie_morning.asp  HOW: Because Ultra Star theater is AWESOME.  WHY:  Because you deserve to get out and enjoy a movie... bonus that it's a movie with Early-Bird prices of $5.75!  I wanna give a shout-out to the management, staff and... whoever thought of parent movie mornings to begin with.  It was nice to get out of the house with my lil one, to do something that I used to take for granted when I wasn't a parent. haha  And then to get there and have the theater so nicely set-up, complete with changing tables and dim lights... well that was amazing.  All of the care-givers there were relaxed, happy and able to enjoy a movie without worrying about missing a part if their lil one fussed.  We all had nothing but praises for your kid-friendly attitude and made plans to meet often.    Thank-you Ultra Star Cinema for a new, great experience.  It's been a while since a place surprised me so much (in a good way)!    See ya there!

Yum yum... after having a fun afternoon at the Desert Botanical Gardens and walking thru the Yucca and Aloe exhibits, my mind had locked onto the idea of getting some yucca for dinner. haha  So what did I do?  Well, I came home and Yelped 'yucca'... quicker than a snap, up popped a variety of restaurants and bars in my area.  Well, after skimming reviews on each of them, I picked the restaurant that was the newest and more reasonably priced, Inka Fest.  An hour later, my roommate, my guy and I were sitting at one of their tables, trying to decided between the many delicious-looking options.  We appetized with empanadas and fried yucca and ended with Bistec a la pobre, saltado camarones and saltado pollo.  It was all delicious!  Seriously, I'd reorder any of the 3 dishes.    The only note was that the restaurant was a lil quiet... could've used some musica in the background.  It was interesting to see the Peruvian channel but it would have been better to have captions on the TV and music playing in the restaurant... for the non-Spanish speaking patrons.   I'll definitely be back.  I'm still thinking about my shrimp saltado!  See ya there. :)

Soma intimates really has nice stuff that will make you feel like a minx without feeling like a tart. haha  The staff was really nice and helpful, too.  The have everything from bras to robes for a reasonable price.  If you're outgrowing or have never been into the idea of Victoria's Secret or Fredrick's, check this place out.    See ya there!

She has moved out-of-state now.  CLOSED!!!  Found this lil nail studio through a Living Social deal. It was the 1st I'd ever bought and probably the last I'll get.  They didn't warn this poor shop owner to put a cap on her offer so she was swamped by customers and it took months to get in for an appt.  And she's the only one working there!  That being said, the pedicure was a good one.    Too bad she moved a matter of weeks after my appt.  Won't see you there.

Zoyo... neighborhood fro-yo (frozen yogurt).    The first thing you notice is the set-up and decor, it's fun, lively and inviting.  The front of the shop is a big garage door like wall that allows an open-air front... which gives you a choice to sit inside (and watch the tvs) or outside (to enjoy the night).  The fro-yo choices are lined up on the right side wall, toppings are towards the middle and then you checkout at the end... convenient and efficient.  Oh, and you can grab a sample cup from the register area when you first come in.    The fro-yo choices were fun and tempted different taste buds.  I was in the mood for Rocky Road so my favorite of the night was the chocolate (with which I mixed almonds and mochi to make my own Rocky Road) but their red velvet and lemon were my 2nd and 3rd flavor choices... all tasty!  My favorite part though was their uber fresh toppings!  There were a million choices, some of which I'd never seen before (that's saying a lot).  Only note is, don't forget you're being charged .39 per ounce... that adds up!  It was my roomies first time at self-serve fro-yo so he got a lil carried away and our bill was over $8. Then afterward, he moaned that he ate too much! ahaha  Next time he'll have a lighter hand.    Two thumbs and a plastic spoon up for our new froyo joint!  Glad it's close to home.   See ya there!

There are moments in our lives that are so special, we want to remember them forever... birthdays, weddings, pregnancy, anniversaries, reunions, or just a perfect simple family day.  My latest precious moment have all come from my 1st pregnancy.  It's been so amazing to watch my body change for my lil baby and I wanted to capture it on film.  Sure, I have a million photos of the last 8 months but, I wanted some that were beautiful and taken by a professional photographer. haha  Don't tell my friends... their photos are great, just mostly amateur and typical.   Well, through friend of a friend connections, I met Audra Little.  She's a Phoenix/Glendale based photographer who specializes in capturing special moments with newborns, babies, children and their families and most importantly... baby bellies!!!  haha She does many special events such as engagements, weddings, senior portraits, etc.  She's also taken pictures for a couple of my friends so I always see her work hanging on their walls when I visit them. :)  We met last weekend for a photo session and she was so nice to work with... photography is her passion!  She had great ideas and props for the photos (blankets, letter blocks, etc) but also ask me to bring some personal stuff, like a pair of little shoes that I plan to have my baby wear.  I also took special baby blankets that family made and a lil teddy bear that one of my best friends gave me for him.  So cute!  Over a few hours, we shot both inside and outside photographs... the day was so beautiful.  We tried some new things and shot traditional pics, too.  It was a lot of fun.  I'd definitely recommend Audra for your photography needs and I plan to go back to her when my baby gets here!  Side Note: Now that I've had a photo shoot (first since senior pictures), I also think it'd be awesome to have a photographer with you for random, nothing days... just to capture unique moments. :)  See ya there!

Wanna have a bit of fun and break away from the hang-overs/ casinos / strip clubs while you're in Vegas?  Go shooting!  I don't gamble or like to get drunk more than 1 night in a row so, it's a great option, imo.  On past Vegas trips, I went to The Gun Store or American Shooters but on this last trip, I found Guns & Ammo Garage.  It's my new favorite.  Why?  First off, they have a free shuttle service that will take you back to your hotel.  Also, they have all the fun machine guns that are hard to find at other ranges but have better pricing and way less wait time than The Gun Store.  I guess people go to The Gun Store because it's been around longer but, I'd suggest trying G&A Garage if you can.    Back to the fun... I got the 'Mob package' which included a snub nose revolver, a 1911 (I've been wanting to buy this gun), a Tommy gun, 2 targets and a t-shirt for $99.  My friend got some machine gun package.  We were able to switch back and forth though so we got to shoot all of the guns picked.  That was really cool.  What's also cool is that they have a kid's package, which includes a .22 rifle and .22 pistol.  Anyway, you can tell I'm a fan.  Our range instructor was a nice Asian guy... not too talkative but he still made sure we understood everything we needed to know.  I'll definitely be back.  PS  My free t-shirt is awesome because they let me upgrade to a sexier woman's shirt!  See ya there!

For many, many years, I have been in love with the Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Bellagio.  When I lived in Vegas, I visited many times to get crepes or other treats.  I often said that I would order a cake from them when it came time to get married... even if the wedding cake cost thousands of dollars (which they kinda do, btw).  Well, in January, my fiance proposed (in Vegas) and though I no longer live there and cannot get my wedding cake from them, we got a mini cake to celebrate with.  It was BEAUTIFUL!  Flawlessly gorgeous.    If you're going to order a custom mini, order a day or 2 in advance.  You'll be picking design, flavor, filling, etc.  It's worth the $90.  Though the icing is a bit thick on the mini, it's still delicious.   Long live Jean Philippe!  So sad I live in the Bay and cannot get them to ship my wedding cake.  (cry)  The mini  made my engagement weekend even more special though!!!  See ya there!

Icey iced ice... tasty and refreshing, Rita's delivers.  You can't help but smile as you walk in the door, anticipating the tasty goodness that is lined up in front of you.  They have simple cream ice, milkshakes, gelati, Italian ices, frozen custard, frozen custard cookies... and on and on.   We stopped by on a random, warm afternoon after passing the new store and noticing the sign... a few samples later, we were sure that we'd found a winner.  My only 'ouch' came when I found out the calories and fat in my Blendini mix.  :-/  Glad I shared it!  We'll just make Rita's an occasional splurge.  Yum... Blendini!  We recommend the Vanilla custard with Toffee. :-D    See ya there!

Ok so, I hate to be the voice of dissent but... this was not the experience for me.  While the black hair guy at front was very nice and the newbie video was funny, laying in an egg of salt water for an hour is apparently not my cup of tea.  I didn't even make it through the hour before I had to get out.  The first 30 min were cool... I drifted off into a tranquil state but then I heard a 'thump' from somewhere that woke me up and I couldn't get back to tranquility.    There were other glitches, too.    My joints literally creaked... snap, crackle, pop, for days afterwards.  And, they had ear plugs that I didn't use (they were optional according to the initial tour), and now, my ears have been 'squeaky' for 6 days.  Every time I yawn, burp or do any kind of weird jaw movement, I can feel it in my ears.  :-/ Weird.    When I went in the next day to ask about the feeling in my ears, a light haired guy behind the counter said he didn't know what to do for it because he floats with no buds all the time and everybody must just be different.  Oh, ok.  Thanks.    So... while it may work for some, it may not be for everyone.    Other thoughts... wow, it's kinda pricey.  If you're not a member, it's $70 a float.  My friend gifted the experience to me but if I'd have paid $70, I'd have been pretty disappointed.    One thing I noted about the other 10 good reviews and 5 filtered... they're ALL 5-star and ALL from people who don't Yelp much.  Most have under 20 reviews and all have under 30.   That's not trustworthy to me.  They're also pretty evenly spaced... March, Feburary, January, Dec, etc.  That's odd and raises an eyebrow to their validity.  If they are promotional Yelps, someone was smart about it and put some work into it... likely because Yelp caught on to their first 5 attempts.    Hope my ears even out soon.  If you're still that earthy spirit who might enjoy the experience, wear your ear buds.    Won't see ya there.

My friend and I have a slight difference of opinions about foot massages in the Tempe area.  He prefers to come here, and specifically likes a girl named Anna (though I'm not sure she's still there) and I like to come here but kinda prefer another joint across town (because it's located close to a boba tea joint - haha).  Honestly though, this place works you out more and the other place is more relaxing - and I prefer a stronger massage anyway. :-)  All-in-all, I've never had a bad back rub here.  Oh, and though the names says 'feet' in it, they do the awesome body massage for the same inexpensive price of $30 (plus $6-$10 tip, of course).  They're always really nice here and it's a quiet, calm environment, even though the rooms aren't completely closed off.  We'd recommend them to anyone looking for an hour of downtime.   See ya there!

Something has taken over me and spread to my friends.  I've gotten into this do-it-yourself and become useful phase of my life that includes home and garden improvement (and a bit of prepping).  Luckily, this Home Depot is not too far from my AZ place so I get to go in and check things out... a lot.    Sometimes, in the store, it's hard to find help.  They're pretty good when you do ask questions, though, and usually have what I need so that's fine by me.  The best experience I've had at this Home Depot location though was today when I called in to find an item I'd seen there.  After I was transferred to Lawn and Garden, I got ahold of Steve.  He was so nice and patient, helping me find the item I needed, though it didn't show in the computer.  It turns out that though I'd seen it only a couple of weeks before, it'd been on clearance and they'd recently put it away.  It was also unsearchable online.    Lucky for me, Steve found the product, more help, and then he and Scott text me pics of the SKU and box description.  That was so awesome and what I feel is above and beyond.  Thanks, Scott and Steve!    See ya there. :-)

If you're in the market for a new firearm or accessories, go to Healy.  And don't go on a busy weekend day, go when you have time to talk shop.  If you can manage a slowed down moment there, you'll walk out with a great product and a head full of information.  This is what happened to my friend and me when we were looking for a simple revolver.  We went in, talked to Mark, and left.  The after a bit of research on our own, we went back and bought the revolver from him.  When we picked it up, he made sure to personally hand it over to us and go through a complete run-through on the handgun so we knew everything about it. :-)    Great service!  You can beat this kind of local merchant... much better than the online experience.    I'd recommend Healy Firearms to friends and family - especially those who love to learn!  Definitely see ya there!

A friend took me here for an early dinner a couple of months back, just to show me the place.  It has a super cool atmosphere that he thought I'd like... and a cheese and pretzel fondue appetizer.  Well, it was pretty freaking fun, though 'm not sure how it'd be in the summer heat as most of the seating is outdoors (with misters).  The cheese pretzel fondue, I would skip next time but there was a kale salad there that may have been the best salad I've ever had.  I can't remember the name but it had nuts and corn and such in it.  It was delicious.  I keep meaning to go back for the salad!  Enjoy their outdoor games... corn hole, ping pong, etc.    Might see ya there!

Serious but friendly, the 2nd Amendment Gun Shop is my kind of stop.  We stopped in there for a quick look and ended up staying a half hour, talking with the owners and looking around.  It's a local shop, privately owned and operated.  They know their stuff and don't mind parting with that wisdom.    Another cool thing about the shop was all the different types of people there.  It's on the smaller side but was packed.  There were a couple of families with kids, and people from all walks of life.  It was definitely a cool feel... which I didn't expect.    I just ended up picking up a couple (4) boxes of ammo and some business cards.  I live in Cali but shoot a lot in Nevada.  I can't buy a pistol or rifle in store but maybe I can buy from their online store.    Definitely see ya there!

So this morning, my 4-year old and I were rushing to our American Airlines gate after a long security line.  We'd had yogurt when we first woke but needed something else for the 2-hour flight we were about to jump on.  My son is normally a pretty cool kid but when he's hangry (hungry and angry) I feel I've failed my mommy duties and not protected the world.  haha  Anyway, that said, I dove into Ziegler's New York Pizza really quick and grabbed a slice of breakfast pizza.  Since our plane had already boarded, I didn't have them heat it but it was still so delicious!  It was egg, cheese and sausage pizza on a sourdoughy tasting crust.  Yum!  Had I known how tasty it'd be, I'd have definitely ordered two.    We're always flying through PHX so will remember Ziegler's!  (It's at the end of the gates, btw.)  See ya there!

It's.... gross!  It's Sugar is a cute looking candy stop in the mall that is filled with candy and novelty gifts.  In actuality though, it's a  showy store front for incredibly low-quality candy at ridiculous prices.  I bought a small bag the other day ($8 for a tiny bag) because it I thought it would be fun to take some to my fiance but in the end, I threw everything away.  Of the much variety I had, only a few were worth eating.  Everything else was some imitation junk for familiar favorites.    For example, the chocolate covered peanuts are the lowest quality I've ever tasted.  The caramels are gross.  The red nibs that look like Red Vines... inedible.  I could go on... Only the bins that was specifically labeled with brand names like 'Chewy Spree' and 'Peanut M&M's' were of any quality.  Oh, and I guess the jelly frog types of candy were decent.    If you end up in this trap, only pull from bins that have name brands labeled on them.  Last note... the girl behind the counter wasn't very friendly... which probably didn't add to the experience.  Her fake 'have a sweet day' when we checked out didn't make up for it.  Advice: if you don't love kids and interacting with people, you probably shouldn't be working in a candy store.    DEFINITELY won't see you there.

Trickery - this restaurant is now called Pho Tempe but used to be Saigon Pho... and it's still only 2 stars.   We went tonight and ordered 3 things. Since it claims to be Thai and Vietnamese, we ordered Pad Thai noodles, Pho Chin, fried rice and Thai tea. You'd think that at least something was good but nope, none of it was good... other than the Thai tea.   They delivered the smallest bowl of weak broth pho I've ever seen (with only 3 pieces of meat). It arrived 10 min before the rest of the food arrived, with no spoons. The Pad Thai noodles, which are normally a dryer noodle, were swimming in sauce , had very little chicken, and had no peanuts (wth?).  The fried rice was... interesting.  My dad said he thought it was decent but wouldn't reorder it.  The rest of us didn't like it.    But the worst part was the TV. The movies playing had had curse words, people puking (not kidding) and tons of violence... That's definitely not appropriate while my 3-year old, retired parents and I were trying to eat. Since there were other kids there, too, I ask them to change it.  They changed it from an F-bomb movie to the movie that had vomit scenes... Nice. Then they wouldn't change it on my 2nd request so my toddler got an eyeful all through dinner. We almost got up at left at this point. Put a cooking show or the travel channel on the TV! Then you'll have something appropriate for all ages and tastes to watch.  The Thai tea was good and the interior looks nice but my parents said to watch out for the bathrooms.   I was trying to get my culinary conservative parents into Viet food since my fiancé, toddler and in-laws are all Vietnamese but this restaurant was a big disappointment.    Definitely won't see you there (especially when Khai Hoan is right down the road).

First off, this location is not closed on Saturday, as is posted.  They are open until noon on Saturdays.  I know because they squeezed me in on Saturday early afternoon for a check-in with Dr Sheehan.  It was a great experience. Even though it was close to his lunch hour and closing time, he took the time to go over all my questions and make adjustments to my weight loss plan.    There are tons of benefits to being with MedShape Weight Loss Clinic, a medically supervised weight loss plan.  For me, it's all about education and structure.  There are so many fad diets with conflicting data, I wanted to make sure I was doing right for my body and losing fat (not weight), in a healthy way.  For my personal experience, MedShape's customizable, medically supervised weight loss program has already been tested in many ways.    Here are some other perks to their support and structure...  *When I have a question, you can immediately call for answers. *During a rough week, you can email or visit support forums and receive suggestions and support. *Your individual plan is customized to your needs and lifestyle.   * Your Dr and/or support staff will explain what your lifestyle change does for your body, such as lowering the insulin levels for lower fat storage and weight gain. *Their custom supplements and prescriptions (if needed) are a good way to condition your body for proper fat loss, instead of just weight loss (which could be muscle instead of fat!). * The MedShape protein bars, shakes, drinks and other foods are a nice break from typical meals.  They don't push them at you though, and I've even been told I can be successful without them.  I still get some because some of them are very good! (write me if you want suggestions) * The accountability and structure in a medically supervised weight loss program is an important motivator for many personality types.  So, I guess you can see why I'm loving my MedShape experience.  By spending less money than I spent on a trainer over the last 6 months at the gym, I've already lost 1/2 of my fat loss goal and am not even 1/2 way through my program.  Now I can combine my training instruction and my nutrition plan!  I keep in mind that health success is made up of a bunch of little decisions that I make throughout the day.    Thanks, Dr Sheehan and MedShape Weight Loss!

Do Over was a good find for my mom and me. We had spent a few days going from used furniture stores to consignment stores, looking for the best pre-loved furniture around.   My parents had just moved into their retirement home in Mesa and needed a few items to fill in some gaps. At Do Over, we found a beautiful rattan chair with a matching ottoman. It showed some wear but was structurally sound and very comfortable. It was originally from the Pottery Barn but it only cost us $70 (we came in during a sale).   Do Over also offers restoration classes for those interests in taking an old piece of furniture and giving it a new look. Give them a call to find out more as I'm not sure on all the details. (Because of this, they sell furniture in various stages of wear.)  Might see ya there!

The pool and beach has been hard on my feet this summer so I'm always in the mood for a nice pedicure.  Luckily, my girl knew just the place!  Emma's Nail Spa is a great lil nail salon that's tucked into the Centennial Marketplace in Scottsdale.  I've been there a couple of times for pedicures and am always impressed by how clean and professional it is.  Adam usually does my pedicures but my friend says she's tried Tara, Darla and Shawn and they're all good.  I just like Adam because he's friendly and gives a nice scrub and massage.    We usually get the Delux Pedicure, which is $35 before tip, but they have a Basic Pedi for only $23 before tip, (those prices are current for July 2013, btw).  They also do Manicures, Acrylic & Gel nails and have waxing services.  Ask about student pricing, if you've got proof you're a student.    Oh and, apparently, Emma's took over an old salon named Desert Nail about a year ago.  Give Emma's a chance and you'll be happy you did.   See ya there!

Visiting a cancer center for my dad's appointments has been a very sobering experience. At a general hospital, you know some people are there for less serious or even happy reasons. At a cancer center, though, that is less often the case.   Still, this Banner MD Anderson Cancer facility does a great job of providing a pleasant environment.  It's a newer place, with giant Windows and pretty photo art. If I were a health care professional, I'd prefer this environment to that of many, many other health care buildings I've been in.   The staff has been great so far, too. We arrived early for our appointment and they started us on the details early, too. They printed out a clear chart on what my dad's copays and cost would be for a ton of services, even those he doesn't necessarily need today. That does a lot for peace of mind and financial and medical decision planning. Then, a kind volunteer showed us the way to our next stop.   Oh and, their lil cafe has a ton of healthy food options, and some tasty looking bakery goods. It seems they really try to take care of their staff and patients as the small grilled salmon salad was only $4.  So far, two thumbs up. I'll be back after some time passes to give another review, complete with recommendations.  See ya there!

Though I am a very frequent flyer, today is my first time flying with Spirit, and even out of Terminal 3. It has been a good experience, so far! My flight is on time, the plane staff is funny and the Sri Lankan lady who checked me in was super sweet and helpful.    Spirit Airlines is one of many airlines that only charges you for the services you actually need. That's one great thing about them if you travel light, like I do.  If you like to check in at the airport instead of at home, check or take -on luggage, choose your seat or board early, understand that you'll be paying extra for it. I'm just glad they give me the option to decline those services instead of writing them into a higher ticket price. That's why I call these airlines "a large carte " carriers. :-)   I'd recommend Spirit Airlines to friends and would take them again myself.  BTW, terminal 3 only has a Starbucks, Wendy's And Mexican place for food so plan ahead of those don't sound good to you!   See ya there!

Review #1055  Wow... what a great local business!    Pikfly is a local delivery service for the Phoenix area. You pik it, they fly it to you... I guess that's what the name means. LoL  Anyway, they deliver a great variety of things from local merchants, from beer and liquor to foods to household items to birthday gifts to dairy and locally grown farmers market where to flowers to health and beauty two kids toys, and more.   Pikfly only launched this year but is already spreading like wildfire through my friends (mostly for booze delivery, I admit).  You can visit their website and pick from a variety of local merchants and products. I can think of a dozen different applications for this. If I'm in the middle of a home project and need a tool delivered, I'll call them.  The next time I'm at a birthday party and feel guilty about not picking up a present, I'm just going to call pikfly to deliver it to the party for me. LOL And the next time I have a dinner party and run out of steak or wine, I don't have to send somebody to the store anymore... Pikfly to the rescue!   Pikfly is a great service for someone like me. Sometimes, I'm too busy to run out to my favorite local merchants, sometimes, I'm just too lazy. Either way, it's nice to have someone deliver what I want to my doorstep... Same day!  My current favorite vendors to order from are Danzeisen's Milk and Von Hanson's Butcher Shop products!  The local milk is out of this world and the fresh brats and meat rubs are unbeatable.  Other vendors offer crazy various things - I was able to have some Sriracha themed gifts delivered to a friend for his bday. Haha. Saved by the last minute purchase of a same day delivery option. Thanks, Pikfly!   I'd definitely recommend Pikfly to family and friends.  See us around!
