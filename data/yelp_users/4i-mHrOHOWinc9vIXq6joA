First off, this place is beautiful. I didn't get to walk around the whole area, but I did learn that the cafe near The back closes at 1. That's where you would go for breakfast, I can't remember the name sadly. I decided to go to The Farm Kitchen to get a sandwich. I got two sandwiches, two small sides of potato salad, and drinks which were in small cups for the whopping cost of $34, before tip. So it's definitely not an inexpensive place to eat, but it's all organic and it's delicious if you're into that sort of thing. I would love to come back again to try their breakfast and to explore some more. Definitely a great place to bring families or to go on a nice date!

I'm sad to give this location a bad review, but this place USED to be my favorite breakfast spot. They claimed they changed their menu last August, but I was in here in early December and got my favorite meal (which is no longer on the menu.) maybe the chef felt like making it one last time, who knows. My waitress was slightly arrogant and the service was awful. Coffee wasn't fresh, my omelette had no flavor, and they also don't carry ranch anymore? Whatever! It's a sad thing that this place had changed so much, but I doubt I'll be coming back again. Sorry Mimi's, I keep giving you one more chance, and you let me down!

This is one of my favorite places to visit on a weekly basis if possible. Me and my best friend, Emily (who reviewed earlier), come here very often. Even one of the waiters recognizes us! I don't remember his name, but he's the one with glasses, lovely young man! I love that they play kpop and not only their latest singles, but so many different songs. I try to eat something new every time I come here, but I always come back to my kimchi jjigae. Everything else I have tried has been fantastic. Yuk gae jang, soon dubu soups, jun, bokum, fried rice, cold noodles, you name it and it's fantastic. Great happy hour, too! I really can't get over how much I love this place! anyways, if you're looking for great authentic Korean food, this is your place!

This is honestly one of my favorite places to go. I haven't been here in a long time since my friend moved away, but I've been craving to go back. They have the best "bar food" ever! Their fries, wings, sandwiches, burgers, EVERYTHING is amazing. I really need to start coming back here more

I love this place. I had been craving shepherds pie for weeks and finally found a place that makes it exactly how I like it! My friend got the bangers and mash and that was fantastic as well. My boyfriend got the Mac and cheese burger which, of course, was delicious! Plus I love their half and half beer list, too ;) and this building is beautiful inside and out. Love their patio! The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I wish the kitchen was open later, since it closes at 10.

I have never ever ever been disappointed in their sandwiches. I haven't even tried half the sandwiches and I can't wait to have them all!! So far my favorite is the Az Philly. Perfection. The employees are awesome as well! Very kind and inviting! My co-workers also love this place. One of them often gets the Chef Salad and she loves it! I would get extra dressing though, as the salads are HUGE! Love this place!

I like to try and go on night Cory is working. He's awesome! This place really takes of us and we make it a habit to come here at least once a week ;

This place is pretty great. They have a good selection of unique pizzas and of course you can create your own. Vegan and gluten free options available. I came here on a double date and we ordered the garlic monkey bread. That was really good and it came with marinara and a sour cream dill sauce I believe. I myself got the Happy Mac pizza. It was really good! I got a side of marinara though to put on top. My boyfriend got the Pig n Chick which is a BBQ pizza. He ate it all in the blink of an eye! My friends for the jalepeno Mac and the k-mac(Korean Mac), meatballs, and wings. I sampled everything of course haha and it was fantastic. I will definitely be back and they are open til 11pm every night.

I was looking for a place to get my eyebrow repierced and was recommended by a friend to come here. I was taken care of by Robert, the shop owner, and let me tell you.. He is awesome! I have since then brought my friend and sister to get pierced by him and he is truly the best. He makes sure that you are comfortable and loves to joke around and make you feel at home. I love walking into the shop to look at all the beautiful jewelry on display and know that I am getting high quality when I go there. I will never go anywhere else and HIGHLY recommend you get all your body modifications done here. Absolutely the best!

I've been on the hunt for delicious ramen for years now. I've had some tasty bowls in Seattle and LA, but never found much luck in Arizona. I usually go to Cherry Blossom in Phoenix for their cha-shu ramen, and it's amazing...but I really wanted s good bowl of ramen with all the fixings. Egg, nori, narutomaki, pickled bamboo, ginger, you name it, I wanted it. This place delivers exactly that!   I ordered the tonkatsu cha-shu ramen. The broth was buttery and had a wonderful garlic taste to it. The noddles were cooked wonderfully (though I still prefer Cherry Blossoms noodles), and the fixings were just a lovely added bonus. This stuff comes so close to the ramen I had in LA last year and it is to die for. The service was great and the staff is friendly. I am so happy I found this place and decided to give it a shot. Will DEFINITELY be back!!!!

This is the most disgusting mexican restaurant I've ordered from and I have never said that before. The only decent things were the rice and beans, and even then, it wasn't that great. I ordered my food to go and got the queso fundido dip appetizer to put on top of my chicken Chimi. The chicken for one thing was bland and flavorless, even with sauce on it. But the queso dip...I have no idea what the hell they gave me. It certainly wasn't a dip. I literally had to cut it as it was just a SLICE OF CHEESE with some chorizo and jalepeno thrown on there. I love mexican food, so I figured it would try it all together. Wrong. All wrong. It was disgusting. I've had a better chimi from a gas station. I am so shocked at how this place has such a high rating. Go to Arribas or Valle Luna. Rositas is great, too. This was just plain garbage.

Best vape shop I've been in. Hands down! I love the atmosphere and with me being pretty new to vaping, I didn't feel pressured or looked down on at all. I always get slight anxiety when I go into a new shop, and at first I was nervous. These guys make me feel comfortable and at ease! I was just expecting to go in and buy a couple flavors. Walked out with four new flavors and ended up staying for over an hour hanging out and playing games. They have custom flavors, a big board of standard flavors, and can make your own. How cool is that!!? I will definitely back, and often at that haha. Plus they have a raffle to win cool stuff! Love love love this place!

I love Tampopo! They have the best Takoyaki I've ever eaten and I love their hirata buns. The rice balls are also amazing with pork inside. As for ramen goes, I love that you can order more noodles. Only other place I've known that does that is a ramen shop in LA. I'm sure it's common, but not in Arizona! I always get the broth with more flavor. I've only tried the Tonkatsu ramen so far, I can't seem to stray away! I still have a hard time deciding if I want to go to Cherry Blossom or Dozo Izakaya for ramen, but tampopo is much closer to me and I love all their other foods!
