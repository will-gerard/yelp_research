I visited Super Dragon On 05/30/2016 for the first time. I have not been too happy about eating Chinese food lately since i have been disappointed by many places before. But my boyfriend wanted to try it and i was curious to do so as well.   We wanted to try everything because we were so hungry and becayused i wanted to like it so bad.   For starters We ordered the crab puffs (8)  we ordered 3 lunch meals: the Walnut shimp the kungpao chicken  shrimp lo mein soft noodle  all orders came with fried rice and an egg drop soup. You can also replace the egg drop soup for a sweet and sour soup for additional $.  The food was good and the service and attention from pur server was exceptional!   I will be going back maybe in a few months since I do t really eat chinise food.

We had the 24 pc BBQ wings and a large pepperoni and jalapeño pizza for 27.99 + 3.60 for the extra toppings ( jalapeños and pepperoni). The wings were ordered hot double baked BBQ, and I must say they were pretty good, I'll definitely other them in the future. The BBQ sauce had a touch of spice and the wings were a bit crunchy, and made a great combination. The pizza we order was okay... I will not be ordering a pizza with those toppings in the future.   The cook recommended to order a cheese calzone, and boy was that good! I ordered both calzones and the cheese one was a hit, the other one would not be order again, the reason was because it had pepperoni , veggies and bacon, and it overpowered the taste of the cheese plus it tasted very similar to a pizza.   Their customer service is great! It was our second time there and they remember my boyfriend's last order. The cashier was very kind and helpful as well .

Last night we celebrated our anniversary at Durant's. The experience was great, from walking in to the bright kitchen to stepping on to the darker dining room.    My boyfriend ordered the porterhouse and got his name on the wall (but it won't be available right away) . but he fell in love with his steak steak. I got a filet mignon. My filet was tender and juicy i really enjoyed it. I'm not one eat steak as a preference but I really did like it, but if you want it with bacon wrap you must ask for it since it's not something they automatically add unless requested.   I was told they had the best martinis in town so i tried them,  mine was a dirty gray goose martini. Very good, strong olive taste but so good on the goose, just like i like it.   For dessert i has the crème brulé; the tray confess with three , a chocolate, vanilla and blubbery, my favorite one was vanilla, so delicious. I can still taste it!   Yet our main highlight was The service , our waitress was so welcoming and so kind, being our first time there we had so many questions but she was just great at answering them. Thank you Durant!

This location has been on my yelp bookmarks for a while. Since I have been driving to work to mesa lately, I decided to give it a try. . I was very disappointed with my order.   I ordered the  fried squid with steamed white rice. The squid was deep fried and had a strong taste of the grease. It had so much grease ; as soon as I took my first bite I had grease left all around me lips. I took 2 bites and I was done. The steamed rice was so dry to the point that it obviously been over cooked.   Since it was my lunch time time , I had ordeded it to go. Took 15 minutes to get it and as soon as I got it I was on my way back to work. I was so disappointed that I couldn't even go back to replace it because I had to go back to work.  Idk why the reviews are so high, I'm hoping is because one only really orders the sqiuid or I'm hoping is because people dine in instead of to go. Whatever the case is , quality should be served regardless if the mean is to dine-in or to-go.   I Lost almost $10 but they Lost my interest.

Long wait, greasy , frozen, flavorless food... Only been here once and I will never return, not even it was free.   I placed my order over the phone and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. I only live 6 minutes away so I left my home at perfect timing to get there at the time they requested.... 5 minutes later... 10 minutes later... 15 minutes later... Did I mention I was the only one waiting?   They had fruit punch that tasted like water and sugar... The man cooking wrote his phone number on a napkin for me (not happening)...   if I you don't believe how terrible the good here was ask one of the other 2 ppl that tried their food with me that day.  The order was for 3 people, not one of us liked it nor will we ever go there again....

Let me start by saying that this is the first Cuban restaurant I have ever been too. Honestly I didn't know what to expect, since I never had Cuban food, only seen pictures. ..   For starters we had tostones De camarón, so good . Is garalic Shrimp and they provide enough for two. I will definitely be returning to eat them again.   I was so excited to try their Cuban sandwich.I was very excited because I am fan of the Cuban torta(mexican versión) of their sandwich. To find out that there is so much difference from both. The sandwich has pork , ham , cheese, pickles , mayo and mustard. No veggies. I honestly am not used to eating a sandwich without veggies (next time I'll add lettuce and tomato ) and the sandwich is pretty big , especially after stuffing your face with appetizers !    their menu also has a item called Cuban sandwich (Mexican style) I believe they might be referring to the torta. Even tho they have different ingredients; I do not recommend, I also ordered it and is almost the same as the Cuban sandwich, but different bread and with lettuce ,which is not the definition for a Mexican torta.  The service was great , the person working there was so attentive, even tho she was the only one there talking care of 5 tables.   Before you leave I know you will be so stuffed and you are not going to be thinking of food anymore buuuut I recommended you try their bread, just take it home and eat it later. I honestly don't know the names of the bread but none disappointed me. Is so different from what I tend to eat, so I was glad I took some home.

I really enjoy coming here, I always get the shrimp pad Thai and it has never disappointed me, I've even ordered it to go a few times and it tastes just wonderful. Never forget to order the thai tea; is delicious, just make sure to tell them to go easy on the ice , otherwise you'll need a refill in no time, also The fried shrimp for appetizers are just delicious! I wish I could upload images but I broke my camera.

I have been coming here since last year and I will give you a complete unbiased review. Throughout the time i been coming here I have notice the a change in staff.  I used to get my nails done by the owner all the time. Sometimes they were beautiful, clean, bump free and other times they were not beautiful, not bump free and super thick. I stopped doing my nails last year on Sept 2015.   This has been the only place i have trusted to do my feet and continue to get my toes done here. No mater who does my toes they have always done an amazing job. However there was One time i came with my sister and an older lady did her toes and her nails were not all shaped the same, some where more square and other more round... My sister has not returned and i have not seen that lady since. She may have a different schedule now or may not be working there anymore.   Every time I go I get the Classic Pedicure $20. Sometimes I get White tip or Matte. That would be an additional 5$. I can not complain because they use clean materials, their facility is very clean and updated. They are not disrespectful by speaking other languages among each other and they get to you as soon as they can.   The reason I will not give this place 4 stars is because a nail salon but i don't care to get my nails done here. And I am not one to be picky , is just i want quality service every single time not only sometimes.

This review was colmpleted friday but posted today After 5 check ins, and 2 other times that i forgot to check in, and many posted pictures later , is time i post review!   By far every experience has been great, the staff never fails to be friendly, and attentive. Now lat me tell you why service is amazing here... First and foremost there's about 3 big tables that can sit six people , 3 that sit four and about 4 that sit 2 now this changes as party grows because the tables are placed together.. Now every single time I been there (except for yesterday) there had only one person attending to many tables at once and delivering such a great service. Now yesterday there was one more person and they both did an amazing job since the place was pretty packed. They continued to give great service, despite the obvious pressure  The food.. I'm not the one that had tried many sushi places... But how could I? when I already fell in love.. I'll feel as I'm cheating if I do!! The food has been great, 7 visits later and the quality remains the same, flavor and texture both perfectly align every time!   For starters they offer a COMPLIMENTARY edamame (which I never ordered)  or gyoza (4 pieces for party of 2 and more pieces for bigger parties). Now they offer happy hour from 11 am to 4pm and from 7pm to 11 pm  Mon- Sat. They have a variety of rolls included and the quality remains the same because out of my 7 times here I have been here twice on a Sunday (_no happy hour special).Now the hiight of day ... The sake bombs for $4 during happy hour. Ive ordered only the sake with a Sapporo beer and I always ask for a second cup and Shae with a friend or my bf , whoever goes    I've basically ordered everything that's deep fried already, and by far my favorite was the sweet thing and viva las Vegas! I always get both ! Soooo good !!! I just went last night and feel going again tonight.. I have problems !  Bathrooms, soooo clean everytime and never fail to disappoint.   I love sushi here
