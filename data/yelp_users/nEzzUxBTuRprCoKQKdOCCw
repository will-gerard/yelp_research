I had to ship a pair of shoes with a prepaid label. I came with just the shoes thinking I could just by the box and tape it up. (I brought my own packing tape) I explained that I needed a box and went to grab one and the lady behind the counter stated I could not pack my own box. She had to pack it and it would cost $16 or so. I left immediately and went to the Fedex store across the street at towne and country. I went in and bought a box for $2. They offered my tape FOR FREE and apologized for UPS and said the person working there was probably scamming people. Sounded like it to me too originally. So I packed my box and wanted to ship through Fedex, unfortunately, postage was already paid for through UPS. So I took the box back and told the lady I bought a box and packed it myself over at Fedex for $2. To which she replied "Good for you!". I will not go back to this location.

Asked for the Portabella Brioche burger... No mushrooms, so instead I got a number 1. Ketchup out in the lobby... So I let the girl on register know. She lazily said (without looking at me) "there are packets there" and points at a little basket. Then I ask for ranch. They were ALSO out of ranch. But I guess it's ok because my fries weren't burnt. Close this store and take inventory because you don't have a lot.

If sushi is cut at midnight... Cut it at midnight. As someone who works in the industry, I know that you have to go by what your website says. Cutting items earlier than their scheduled times is bad for business. From my restaurant's perspective: you lost a customer because you decided to try and get out of work early. Which shows where your priorities are.   Sushi until 11:55 (or earlier maybe) for those of you who don't know. Not 12. Seems minor but pretty disconcerting when you make it to a restaurant before something is cut only to find out they did away with it earlier than they were supposed to. What are the hours posted for if you don't abide by them?

Anthony Vigil is hands down best the that I've been to. Went to Vidal Sassoon awhile ago and it doesn't compare to the cut I got from him at Saints and Scissors. He is friendly, professional and skilled. He responds quickly to requests for appointments and completes cuts in great time. He was able to squeeze me in last minute and I got my hair cut completed in 15 minutes! I have gotten a lot of compliments on the haircuts I've gotten with Anthony and will continue to get my hair cut with him. He ALWAYS gets it right. Thanks!

UH-MAZING!!!! I came here because a friend had recommended Ruth and my normal guy was busy. I was reluctant to have a new stylist as I ALWAYS have bad luck with haircuts! Like really, it's awful how bad it has been. So... I trusted her. I will never go anywhere else for a haircut again. Ruth is NOT allowed to retire EVER. She listened to what I wanted, gave me feedback and set me on a different path. I LOVED my haircut when I left and have only grown to love them more each time I come in. I completely trust her with my hair. So much so, that I let her choose a new style this last time I went in and as you can imagine... she ROCKED it!   Ruth is an amazing hairstylist and person! She's engaging and so friendly! You can tell she genuinely cares about her job and the people she is working with. I also have to add: Her haircuts are the only haircuts I have ever had where people consistently tell me, "Your hair looks great!", "Who cuts your hair???", "That's such a great haircut for you!". Did I mention she's amazing and that I'll never go anywhere else? I think I did!   If you're thinking about trying this salon, DO IT!!! All of the staff is extremely professional and inviting. The salon looks amazing and is convenient to park at considering it is downtown. You will not be disappointed in taking a chance on a new place here!

At first when I found Cabana on Thomas I was very happy. I thought it was a cool retro place that had great rates. Unfortunately, the cheap rent came with a lot of other cheap things.   I was moved into an apartment right on Thomas Road. My fault for not waiting for cars to pass by to hear just how loud it was. (I have since become somewhat OK with motorcycles blaring by every now and then). Upon inspection I noticed that the window in my kitchen (although closed) was closed too much and left a small opening that you can see through.   I notified maintenance immediately and was told that they would fix the window. I came home to some cheap weather stripping placed on and still a lot of road noise.  16th St. and McDowell is a BUSY intersection and is in somewhat of a ghetto area. LOTS of motorcycles, cars without exhausts, Diesel vehicles and Semi trucks not to mention the helicopters that fly in when people are flown into the children's hospital. All this with a thin window was not very welcoming in my new apartment. So I asked to then be moved. The office said they'd wave my $75 transfer fee and they would let me know when another unit became available.   When a great unit became available I was met with a $75 fee and being forced to sign a YEAR lease. I originally only signed a 6 month lease and decided that was not an option. I spoke with the property manager and was told I HAD to pay the $75 fee to move although originally told I would NOT have to pay, and that I could sign a 6 month lease. Extending the lease was not an option from the beginning as I will be getting a roommate in November. The property manager then said that, fixing the window was not financially beneficial to them, they were ok with the leaking of air since they pay for it, and that I should invest in noise canceling drapes. Since I wasn't going to pay the money to move I had to deal with it.  Fine, they don't care about me being comfortable. It hurt but I'm a big boy, so I started looking for the new place I'll be moving into in November.   Now, ALL of the lights in my apartment flicker at the exact same time. So I put in a request to have it fixed. Got a paper saying "light fixed". No call for permission to enter the apartment, nothing. Just a paper saying THE light fixed. OK, whatever. I turned on three lights and ALL of them flicker at the exact same time repeatedly. Nothing was done. They most likely walked in and put the paper down saying they fixed it. This is also may not be financially beneficial for Cabana to fix.   Sent a second request (WILL UPDATE)  Other things of interest: Parking is abysmal. I have seen 2 people back into other cars and drive away, and windows have been smashed in cars in the parking lot, there is no back in parking allowed (no idea why), never any spots, they have like 10 Blink charging stations and not one electric car, if you park there you get a notification saying that they will tow your vehicle at your expense. Someone rammed the gate a couple days back so now we have people walking around door to door trying to sell you stuff, ask if you want a free government cell phone, inviting me to church and God knows who coming in off the street.    Had I known any of this I would not have moved here. I've had 3 apartments before this and never had an issue that wasn't resolved. However, at Cabana on Thomas it's about the money and how much THEY can make. Not really about how comfortable you are in your residence. Pay up or shut up. At least that's how it feels.  ALSO: $21.95 "convenience fee" to pay online.... STUPID!

With certain things I am obsessively particular. My hair and beard are included in that list. If you want a barber who will give you exactly what you want or something even better, you gotta see Edgar! He kills it every single time! He's been my barber for almost a year now and I have to say he's the best I've been to! Beard and haircut are always on point and he's really personable. Always a pleasure going to get my haircut and usually book as soon as I can as he's in high demand. His online booking system makes things easy and quick! Check him out! You won't regret it!
