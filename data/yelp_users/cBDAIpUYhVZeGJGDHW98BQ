I have been going to China Way for the last few years and it was my goto place for chinese food it was awesome.  I went there shortly after the change and noticed the menu and my usual numbers were gone. Is it me or is most Chinese food seemingly ordered by numbers? After decoding the new menu, I ordered my usual for the family, Generals Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Beef and the Chicken Dumplings. Got it home and noticed visually that the food looked different and smelled different too. Upon tasting it all, yep, not the same. The General Tso's chicken was more like a citrus/orange chicken, the Mongolian beef was bland and the dumplings were soggy and pale, not partially crisp like they used to be.  So last night 6/11/14 I decided to give them another shot since they are close to home and maybe they had a bad day or something, it happens. Well sadly the prior visit seemed to be the par that has been set.  Regretfully I will not be going back to China Way until they return the recipes that made them so good. If you read this China Way I hope you take this to heart and work to keep your loyal customers of many years.

Went here for a work function today. What can I say, this place is awesome! A great variety of meats all cooked to perfection. My favorite was the bacon wrapped filet, yum!  Nice salad bar with good variety as well, instead of bacon bits, they have a bowl full of uncrumbled bacon.  Lastly a slice of cheesecake with strawberries, mmm.  Simply awesome stuff! Taking the wife when I can.

Wife and I decided to give a local steak house a try and chose JC's since it was just down the road from us. We had read reviews on Yelp and Google and they were a mixed bag. I take reviews with a grain of salt and also those that have not checked in I am very skeptical of.  Anyways, we went this past Saturday evening about 7pm and there was no wait at all. Sat right down and we were greeted by Levi asking what we would like to drink. Kilt Lifter and the Mint Lemonade. We decided on the Spinach artichoke dip which was good, was a little thin but thickened up as it cooled off. Wife opt'd for a dinner salad and I did the Clam Chowder, I should have gotten a whole bowl instead of a cup, was very good.  So on to the entree, wife ordered the Prime Rib Gilbert cut with mashed cauliflower and I got the Steak Oscar with baked potato and veggies. Wife enjoyed her prime rid and I loved the Steak Oscar, it was cooked to a perfect medium, was tender and juicy. Add the crab and Bearnaise, mmm yum! The veggie mix was ok, I would have preferred an option broccoli instead. Everything was served hot and fresh. Only down side is it was somewhat chilly inside which in turn caused the food to cool quicker than expected, maybe turn up the thermostat some for the winter months.  For desert we ordered the Pineapple Creme Brulee, I was skeptical on the combination of such, i was the chocolate cake, but wife wanted the Brulee. It was surprisingly good and was not over powered with pineapple like I expected.  A couple of thoughts for the ambiance, maybe replaced the commercially labeled salt and pepper shakers with something more suited to the atmosphere. Also maybe some nice work flooring in the dining area might give the area a more warm feel and help keep down the coolness of the concrete. Lighting was not bad, but maybe something a little dinner to set the mood and something more centered over the booth tables.  Overall this was a good dining experience and will be going back for sure. :)

What can I say, they are consitent. I came by this morning for another another steak and egg breakfast burrito, it's good and the green sauce made it great. So nice to have one close to home now, that could be dangerous. ;)
