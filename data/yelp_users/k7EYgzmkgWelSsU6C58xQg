The prices for this cafe were appropriate, and the food had good portions! I am pleased to say that I am excited to come back...although I think they're remodeling currently. Still, my friends and I are looking forward to it.

I've been expecting this place to get better whenever I go there, but each time has brought a bad experience. The first time, I had a horribly rude waitress and slow service. The food was mediocre. The second time, I had a great meal with the enchiladas and good service, but my significant other had to ask to take the food back once, and almost a second time, too! For a Mexican food place in the middle of Phoenix, one would expect authentic and flavorful cuisine,  but this place is far from it and overpriced to add.

I have been coming here for years, and there's a very good reason for it! There are tons of pizza joints, but if you want better pizza than in NYC, GO TO NAPOLI'S! I could live off of their wings alone. The place is family-run, and it's local, so they keep everything tasty and fresh. They are loyal to loyal customers and really get to know you, if you go enough! It's fun for a date, friends, or to-go! The thin-slice pizza (with any topping) is great and so is their ranch. Can't get enough.

This place is amazing! The staff is super friendly, the flowers are quality, and the delivery aspect is nice! Ziggy the Flower Piggy is adorable and a nice addition to hold to the incentive when they give away flowers!

Pizzeria Bianco is definitely one of the premier pizza place in Arizona. I've been there a few times now, and I would say it's worth it every time! I have a friend who goes there frequently for her birthday, and I'm happy to tag along!

I know this may be unpopular opinion, but I just never really liked Chino. The combo of the ingredients never sat well with me. I can never stomach it! I don't think I should have to mentally prepare myself to eat somewhere! Perhaps separately, the Chinese and Mexican food would do good, but for the price, I'm still not a fan.

This Starbucks has an incredibly friendly staff and even better drinks! For some reason, anytime I go, everything tastes better there! It's hard to go to another location!

Just a few weeks ago, I was looking for a simple hook to put back up a shelve in my closet. I went through THREE employees on a 30-minute man-hunt for some simple hooks! I couldn't believe it. I usually have a decent experience at this Home Depot, as I get my Christmas tree from them every year, but this was truly off-putting. (Awesome tree service, by the way!)

This is a really great theater to attend! The service is friendly, the theaters are clean, and I had no idea a matinee was only $5! It's centrally located and is easily accessible.

Easily accessible for downtown and everything you would expect out of a quality Greek dining experience! Great gyros!

I love Souvia! Just walking in to a calming environment like this is so pleasant within itself! I love the staff, too! There was a girl named Jamie who was a complete doll, although I'm not sure if she works there anymore. This fantastic, LOCAL, loose-leaf tea place fits all of my tea needs. Any tea drinker, or any non-tea drinker, should try this place once.  The amount of tea and the knowledge of the baristas is astounding. They have hundreds of types at all times, and have a fantastic seasonal collection as well. Tea can cure just about anything! I would gladly pay $4 for a giant iced tea from here over Starbucks any day. Haha, anyway, I really do love coming here and as I'm writing this, I know I should go today!

This is my all-time favorite theatre!!! I love all the people who work there and even the rotating staff. I have always liked the fact that there's a student discount and $1.50 loyalty cups on top of free medium popcorn with the loyalty shirt. The theatres are clean and the whole place is effeciently ran.

I have only been here once, but my experience was happily unforgettable!  I was with a large party, and every single person had to share their dish because it was "the best". The prices are fairly reasonable, but do not necessarily fit the downtown vibe. The waitress that was there was incredibly helpful and it didn't feel like she was the only one waiting on us-she was everywhere at once. Highly commendable.  I'm surprised that it's mainly empty when I walk by, but I can't wait to go again.

I have been going to Chick-fil-A's all across the country and I absolutely love it!  All of the staff is the highest quality out of any place I've ever been! The food is great, and is pretty well-priced. The prices have gone up over the years, but not enough to truly deter people, I don't believe. The kid area was fun for me years ago, and I know it still holds the same value today. They easily have the best sweet tea out of any place I have ever been to, and am proud to say that I will never stop going to Chick-fil-A!

They have pretty good customer service, but I would argue most movie theatres here in the valley do. I have to say that no discounts for students is insane! I can't even go on a date here without a gift card because $20 is way too much for a movie. Even the concessions are outrageously expensive!

My mouth waters every time I think about coming here. For sure better than Paradise Bakery. I had a chicken pasta and soup that was to die for! I loved it, and for the pricing, I was pleasantly surprised! I think I paid under $15 for both of those in full size plus a drink. It could have been a sit-down restaurant! I've only been here once or twice, but all of my friends have gone mulitple times. I know what I'm doing for lunch soon!!

Hob Nob is the PERFECT coffeehouse atmosphere. The staff is cool, and the coffee is, of course, excellent. Their white cake and chocolate cakes are easily the best I've EVER had. The salad and tea combo is also a must-have. I can't find a single thing wrong with this place. I look forward to going there every time I do and have a pleasant experience. Last time I went, there was even live music! Love it.

This is easily my favorite coffee place of all time! I'm convinced it's a job requirement to be positive here, but it's so easy to be uplifted on top of the caffeine I'm about to consume! I love the environment and the drinks! My favorites are the frozen caramelizer and blueberry pomegranate smoothie! All of my friends have converted to thr Dutch side happily!!!

I have gotta say, this yogurt place is probably the most tasteless I've experienced. As the froyo trend has spread across the valley, I know that I have tried just about everything. The yogurt is typically the same-tasting, but this place just didn't do it for me. The best part about the experience was the service, though!

The atmostphere of this place met my expectations, BUT, the coffee was disgusting. I asked for an iced coffee and then had to put my own cream and sugar in it and there was WAY too much ice. Not only did the coffee taste ashy, but the fact that the barista was rude and acted confused when I asked for cream and sugar after I paid and exorbitant amount for a small coffee made me more bitter than the coffee itself. I haven't gone back since and was upset at the hype.

This place fits the hipster and urban vibe perfectly!  Their italian sodas, coffee, and Chicken Chop Salad (one of the freshest salads I've ever eaten) are all amazing! I love coming there to study, hangout, and eat!! It's open basically all of the time and is pretty decently priced in general and especially for the quality.

The Good: I have attended this bakery a few times, and every time the paninis are fantastic. The chicken pomadori and hibiscus lemonade are to die for. The Bad: The staff was slow, and the service wasn't entirely pleasant. The Ugly: Basically everything on the menu besides the paninis and a few salads are almost inedible. The macaroni and cheese is rubber-y and tasteless. Other sandwiches are average.

My friends and I have found a few more sandwiches to choose from, but the rating would still be the same.

There are virtually no complaints from myself and friends when it comes to Bowl of Greens. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and willing to make you something new if you are not satisfied with your order. (This only happened once to me, but it was truly because of personal preference, not the quality of the dish.)  The food prices are reasonable-especially for a college student. The pita chips and hummus are the best I have ever had!  The smoothies are a little price-y (~$5) but very much so worth it if you are craving one! They're freshly blended and healthy, too as an added bonus. I feel full and satisfied every time I leave!

Where to begin? I must say, I have been a BIG supporter of Chick-Fil-A over the years. However, Cane's chicken tenders/strips/what have you are outta this world! The portions are HUGE so the cost of under $10 for a meal like this is outrageously good. The sauce is better than any other specialty dipping sauce I have tried and the lemonade is simply the best. Even the Texas toast is the best I've ever had. It is fast food, but it doesn't truly feel like it. The staff at every Cane's I have gone to is friendly as well.  Can't wait to come back!

LongHorn has always been so underrated to me! I have loved coming here over the years, and I expect I'll return for many more! I love all of the chicken dishes they have to order along with the salads. I really enjoy having family and friend time here, as they love it as well! I only with there was a LongHorn closer to me.

I LOVE THIS PLACE. I am usually not the biggest fan of breakfast places, as breakfast is not my favorite meal of the day, BUT this place is my new favorite. You may spend the extra dollar here and there, but the portions are huge and very tasty. I had the omelette and hashbrowns, and honestly, I don't know if my mom could have made them better!  Another nice surprise was their jelly/jam. It was fresh and flavorful-not at all like a Smuckers package!  I'm very glad to say I'm within walking distance because I know I'll be coming back for more. I would say though, the lines are long for a reason! Save yourself some time and call it in to go if you have the chance!

This place is crazy good! All products are made locally in Gilbert I believe, and the flavors you know are real because they make the pies and such and fold it into the ice cream! The seasonal pumpkin pie tastes like pumpkin pie because it actually is. It fits perfectly into the Downtown Phoenix atmosphere, too l, because it has a lot of personality. For the quality, the prices are great, and the presentation is perfect! I love going there any time!

One of my favorite places to eat on Mill, or anywhere in Tempe for that matter! They make one of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had and amazing onion rings! I've never met anyone who has been disappointed by the portions or pricing either. The service is pleasant and the waitress remembered my friends and I, our orders, and even the time we came in previously!! Talk about service-and that was on Halloween of all times! I'm incredibly impressed and happy to say I'll keep coming back.

This is definitely my go-to pizza place! All of the food is great-even the wings! The prices are very reasonable and there's a 10% discount for ASU students! It's really hard to go wrong here.
