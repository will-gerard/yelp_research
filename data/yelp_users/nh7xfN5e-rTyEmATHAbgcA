So I decided to give 24 Carrots another try since the first time I had gone there I left without ordering due to the rude attitude of the workers. I ordered a hummus plate to go. Simple enough. When the menu says "seasonal veggies" I assume it means not veggies I receive with my chicken wings (I got carrots, cucumbers and celery). When I received my food before I even touched the box I asked if they could switch the cucumbers and celery for more carrots since I dislike them. They said no. So I figured I could overlook that as long as the hummus was good. I got home and realized the "pita bread" was nothing more then cracker wafers. And the big kicker is the hummus tasted like bland baby food. I called to complain and the manager, Amanda, proceeded to tell me I was wrong because their hummus is the most popular thing there and that the pita bread was lavosh bread. I worked in customer service for a long time so this really pissed me off. The proper thing to do would be to offer for me to come back and then replace it with something that might have more of what I was looking for flavor-wise. I had just had a great workout and wanted some fresh, flavorful food to eat for lunch. I will never go back to this restaurant, which is sad because I really do enjoy eating healthy and I have also advised my friends to avoid this place as well and to head to Pomegranate Cafe instead. At least that place has friendly staff, better food and they won't have to wait an hour for their food.

I love bringing my kids here. The train is fun (when it's not breaking down while we are on it) and there's always plenty of kids for my girls to play with.

My mom and I stopped in after a women's expo at the convention center for a bite and I was pleasantly surprised! The food was great, the service was quick and the atmosphere is fun. I definitely recommend this place for anyone downtown looking for a yummy meal (especially the protein bowl with chicken!)
