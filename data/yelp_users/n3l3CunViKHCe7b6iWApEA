I had contracted with them to do the back drop at my wedding. The twinkle lights burnt out and left the room really dark. Videos of our wedding didn't have enough light and it truly took away from the ambiance in the room. They didn't really care though. They gave us around $100 back even though everything cost over $1,700.  I should have know better as up to the wedding day it was always difficult to get ahold of them. They kept confusing my order and had to re explain what I wanted multiple times. But at the end of the day it's disappointing to look at wedding pictures and notice that the twinkle lights weren't on  resulting in a bland background. Bummer.

Corrina is amazing! I didn't want to spend a huge amount on flowers for my wedding and was having difficulty finding a florist who would not only work with my budget but get the flowers I really wanted. She took the time to understand what I wanted, reviewed different styles, and came up with solutions that really fit what I was looking for. When the flowers showed up on my wedding day they were amazing. I would highly recommend them for your wedding!!

5 stars for Tauny!!! My husband takes our two fur kids to get groomed and Tauny does an amazing job. We have a pomchi who has a partial collapsed trachea and she's great with him. We tried so many specialty groomers across the valley and was hesitant to take him to Petsmart but so glad we did!!

A Robert Irvine attitude adjustment for the wait staff and kitchen help needed immediately!!   I was so excited to bring my boyfriend here as Arriba caters for the company I work for and the food had been great.   When we arrived we were asked to sit in the cantina area. While it was colorful and inviting, the service and food was dreadful.   First, let me start by saying it took 15 minutes to get our appetizer. We ordered the queso and upon arrival it was cold and the layer of cheese had already started to crust.   While we were eating out appetizer, the waitress finally decided to take our food order. It took another 30 minutes to get our food. I had the carnitas. The meat was burned to a crisp. The waitress did, after 25 minutes, inform us that the kitchen was backed up. We counted less then 6 tables. Hmmm .. maybe she forgot the order and had to hit the RAIL button.  Now, let me take a step back and mention that it took our waitress quite some time to get our drink order (water and sprite). I asked for a straw (I just started invisalign and my teeth are a bit sensitive) and she never brought one. I am glad it provided my boyfriend a chivalrous moment to hand over his straw.   Hopefully I can figure out a way to attach a photo, but the entire time we were dining we had the pleasure of looking at four tables that had not been cleaned. We should have got the hint to leave when the table in front of us got up and left a full meal.  As the meal came to an end, the manager did stop by and ask us how everything was. We did mention the delay in getting our food (we didn't mention the burned food although we probably should have), and so he felt obligated to comp a portion of our food. He 'graciously' provided us with the employee discount. Instead of a $47 check it was $39. Thanks buddy!   Needless to say, we wont be going back.

Best egg rolls Brumm has ever had!   Great service, the waitress checked on us frequently, our drinks were always full and everything was brought out with perfect timing.   The food was wonderful and the drinks were unique.   I am glad it is close to home, I can definitely see us frequenting the Bamboo Club.

Please DO NOT go here!!!   There was a bug in the ice machine, when it was brought to the attention of the store manager, she cared less. Now mind you, it was not "caught" in the machine, it was actually dispensed through the ice machine ... super gross. I wonder when they cleaned it last.   The store manager talks down to her employees in front of the customers and treats them like dirt. They must be hurting for money as the subs don't even come close to the descriptions provided. For example, "sandwiches get two slices of meat, not three; don't over fill the scoop on the steak scooper".  She also backs her SUV at the front door and takes ups space for customers to park in.   If you like Subway, there is one off of Shea that is way better (although they only have soup during the winter time).

AMAZING!!!   We had intended to go to Sakana Sushi and the wait time was 40 minutes. We saw Crust next door and decided to give it a try.   Finally, we had the dining experience we have been looking for. From the service to the flawless food, we had an amazing time. This is the best Italian we have found in Scottsdale.   The strip mall does not serve Crust at all, it is truly the diamond in the rough. Everything is fresh, creative and mouth watering.   We had the spinach and artichoke dip for our appetizer. Best EVER!   I had the special, linguine with clam sauce and Jason had the meatball parm calzone. Have you ever seen the movie Ratatouille? Well we felt like the food critic at the end enjoying the speechless, delicious meal.   We ended our meal with the special, cookies and cream cheese cake. Ladies, this is not one of those desserts where you can eat a couple bites and leave the rest to your man ... it is so delicious we were fighting each other for the last bite.   Their drink selection is marvelous. Jason had the key lime pie martini. It was like none other. It was key lime to the core and they even included the pie crust crunch.   The service was watertight. I have never seen such a hard working staff. They helped each other out, glasses were always full and extremely willing to provide anything needed at every table.   I can't wait to go back!!!!

The fried rice was disappointing as it consisted of rice and meat. No onions, green onion, etc. We ordered take out and when I called to provide feedback the staff put me on hold for over five minutes and then just kept repeating back what I had said. She finally said that's just how they make the fried rice and you have to request for everything to be added. Strange.

Whatever happened to a real dueling piano bar? They sing the same 'ol songs every night and don't ever change it up. It's perfect for after a hockey game when you've already had a few and can sing just as obnoxiously as everyone else.   I would be scared to eat the food. The service is super slow. Maybe the food is good if you drank too much and can't taste anything anyways.

We lost our voices from screaming (yes, Jason did too!).   This place has four haunted houses to go through. Each one was unique in it's own way. They were all fun, scary and the cast made a world of difference.   Everyone working really got into their part. They almost looked like they were having more fun then the guests! The costumes, make up and props were great (they even had us walk through a trailer house!).   For the best experience, try to go with two or three people through the houses. If you are with a large group, you may want to break it up. If you can't, the cast does a good job trying to get the people trailing from behind scared as well (watch out from the back!).   There are a lot of teenagers there, but it is to be expected. If you have a good Halloween spirit and enjoy haunted houses, this is the place for you.   I hadn't gone to a haunted house in over 10 years. A huge thanks to the cast. We had a great time! Arizona Scream Park is tough to beat!  They did have beer and soda. Cash only.

Tried them 4 times since moving out to Desert Ridge. Each time I've been there I've received the incorrect drink each time. The label on the cup is correct but what they put in it is wrong. Also, seems as though they don't use their instruments properly as their drinks are always watered down as well. Super gross!

This is the worst Starbucks I have ever been to across all 50 states.   1. They can't multitask and serve multiple customers (it takes 20 minutes to get your drink). I don't care how busy you think you are; I have seen busier Starbucks figure it out.   2. When they make a drink with flavoring, they put the flavor in with the milk and steam it, this burns the syrup and spoils the drink.   3. No one smiles or says a simple 'thank you'.   This Starbucks is less then a mile from my house (in walking distance) I am now a proud owner of a Tassimo.

Love Park Avenue! I needed something fresh and new and this was the perfect place to go. The staff is incredibly nice and attentive. The ambiance is fun and at the same time relaxing. They have a variety of hair stylist; but I do adore Kate! The owner, Holli, is amazing and does a fantastic job keeping customers and her staff happy. She's really talented and does a great job training her team. Both are creative, fun, and make you feel right at home. Prices are super competitive and fair. They even offer a cute boutique, makeup, and a variety of hair products. I highly recommend anyone (male and female) check it out!

Great area, but not easy to get to. The food was ok, but unseasoned. They weren't able to serve alcohol for the longest time (strange since it is really a sports bar) but I believe they just starting serving beer and wine. Awkward environment, I am not sure I would want to hang out and watch a sporting event there.
