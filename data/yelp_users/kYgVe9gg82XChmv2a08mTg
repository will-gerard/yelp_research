There is a reason why when I lived in Scottsdale for 3 1/2 years I never ate at Kyoto. But upon my last visit I decided I should try a new place. Hmmmm.... I now have also learned to ALWAYS trust my trusty yelper's reviews.  This was a bad choice on my part. Bad, slow service. Poor sushi selection. No wine menu.  The sushi came out cut as thick as a piece of steak. I hate thickly cut sushi. Rolls.....bland. Ambiance was that of a cheap, generic restaurant.  The good.....cheap, sushi was fresh and didn't taste bad. But with all that being said I'll pass on a next time here.

Parelez vous en francais? Moi aussi!  Ok so I love the French but I usually don't do french because moi= vegetarian. I am not sure if this place is really considered french but the menu sure seemed like it to me.  French Onion soup........done as well as it can be done. Perfect blend of onions and cheese....the best I've had in awhile. I will go back just to have it and to lick every spoonful of cheese off my spoon ever so seductively.  Wine list= fabulous.  Scallops= hmmmm I can't really remember because of that great wine I had which I forgot what it was called because I drank too much of it. But they were really good in some sort of lemon-y sauce.  I loved the art for sale on the walls. I think because of all the wine I drank I almost bought the naked women tile on the back wall. Today I am glad I didn't buy it because it would clash with my decor.  The only negative thing I have to say is that the table's kinda reminded me of a grandma's table.... could use some updating. The lovely art I thought did clash with the grandma's tables.  Besides that... J'adore!!

This is the place to go if you are looking for a great view and nice ambiance.  The menu usually changes monthly which is nice. Always have a great soup on as well. Last night was lobster bisque, not too creamy, I liked that. They often have some great vegetarian options as well. Usually they have some type of tofu on the menu, but  last night they did not. I had the edamame/ scallion ravioli which was not the best that I have had there. My "dinner date" had the fillet minus the bacon. Hmmmm....I don't remember what he even had to say about it. Must of been all the wine. But I do remember the "bus boy" (what is the proper name for them, someone tell me!) who kept trying to take his dish away because he thought he was done! That is the most annoying thing they can do at restaurants especially when you are trying to enjoy the whole "sanctuary" experience. We also were sat outside (have a reservation if you want the nice booth facing the windows) which I didn't particularly care for but I guess I am a picky "date".  But I'll be back!

I have to agree with most of my fellow yelpers and say the service here does suck! We waited at least 20 minutes for our bottle of wine, guess they had to fly back to Napa to pick it up. But the food did win me over. I had the best squash ravioli, ever! It had the perfect amount of filling and the veggies went well with it. The goat cheese grits were outstanding! I never knew I liked grits but with goat cheese.... Yum... It was a hit! The truffle scented mac and cheese.... Mmmmm... Not so much. It did not taste nor smell like the wonderfully truffley aroma that I love! Disappointing. All in all the food was pretty worth it. The lack of attention from the waitress was made up from the attention from the table next to us!

This place is great! I wish I would of went here when I lived closer to the place. But it was worth the drive.  Had some great appetizers and wine with some friends AND it was happy hour so the appetizers and wine were half off!  I was psyched to see when the hummus came out it was served with a roasted head of garlic! I love roasted garlic! The hummus was amazing, by far the best hummus I've had in the valley. It may be too garlic-y for some but I loved it. The portobello mushroom with crab was also pretty tasty and amazing. It was grilled to perfection (not dry!) and some crab mixture was put atop. It was just so good! The baked brie was so-so. I've had better store bought. My friend, the lone meat eater, had wings. And judging from his hand and face after, they must of been pretty good! It was a great spot for a fun get together with friends. They even had a live band playing, for those that like live music.  I will be back soon!

I love the amenities this spa has! The steam room, Swedish showers, aromatherapy room, the hot tubs..... But I was naked with no bikini so I couldn't go outside to experience the rest of the fun stuff like the roof top pool or the grotto looking area with the waterfall. This place was absolutely beautiful!  I had an awesome hour long massage here. While it wasn't the best massage I have had, (I prefer man massages) it was satisfying. I had just climbed that day so I thoroughly enjoyed the forearm, hand and feet part the best!  They have the best prickly pear lemonade along with a million teas as a complimentary beverages. Yum! I also ordered lunch and sat in the beautiful outside atrium area. The tuna wrap was awesome! The only thing I didn't like about this place was that it was pretty busy. But I guess that's why I could get a last minute appointment which I appreciated.

Since I'm often with a "Persian", I have been here quite a few times. Just went again the other day. I enjoy the restaurant but since I'm not a meat eater, it's kinda hard to find alot to eat other than the appetizers. I love Love LOVE the yogurt cucumber drip and their soft warm bread. That's pretty much why I like the place. They do have some vegetarian stews but I'm not a huge fan of those. What I really like is the fesejuan (sp?) walnut pomegranate stew. It has chicken pieces in it but they will take it out for u, if u wanna pay. Last time they took it out and didn't make me pay... But now I guess with the crappy economy they now make u pay! Double the price of the entrée. Crazy. It does come with enough rice to feed u for days. The "persian" I come here with loves the chicken kabob. He never eats chicken so I guess that says something... Hmmm... Persian chicken is better??

So after venturing up to cave creek in hopes of going to the spotted donkey (which we never found.. Thx to the wrong map on yelp!) We were starving and just wanted to eat so we found this joint. And eat I got. It was worse then those restaurants that were names "eat" that I would see along the roadside as a kid(which I never ate at). Nothing for vegetarins here other than fried fish. I had green chile soup, a cheese crisp(that was more a pile of greasey cheese than anything) and a ceaser salad. My friend had a steak that resembled the steaks in a commerical for Coco's. After eating this food I felt absoultly sick. I won't be back. I rather eat at EAT.

Since today I hiked Camelback (the echo canyon side) for the first time of the "season", I thought I'd review it. And how out of shape do I feel now! I used to hike Camelback 2-3 times a week until I hurt my knee last year, and I would make pretty good time. Not today, I am embarrassed to say it almost took me twice as long...I am going to blame it on the still 100 degree heat and unrelentless sun! I love this hike because of the great location right in the middle of P.V. and usually it is a pretty short and intense hike, so I can get my workout for the day done quick. Since I have a short attention span, long hikes aren't good for me!  I also love Camelback for the rock climbing it offers, so close to home! Bonus! I actually saw a few newbies top roping today! But climbers, beware! The rock is pure choss! I have had holds come off in my hands and I've slide down the rock on my belly! Painful! Thank goodness I was just bouldering!   Another thing...watch out for the tourists! They can be a hazard! Especially coming down the mountain. Get out and enjoy the views!

Ok....first of all I have to say...I do love tourists as I am often one myself. But if you are a tourist and never have hiked in your life please don't hike Camelback! As I am coming down the other day after breaking my "record", I come up to this woman clutching the fence for her dear life. I try to go around her and end up falling on my butt, sliding down the rocks! Nice! Thanks for the "rock rash" on my lower back! Its sexy!  Seriously watch out for damn tourists!

Mmmmmmmmmmm.... can you say "ooey gooey"? This has got to be one of the best cupcakes I have ever had, and I love my cupcakes. It was so moist and the delich frosting just melted in my mouth. Mmmmmm..I am still having cupcake-gasms right now! Not only are they delish they are ooooo so cute. The x-mas themed cupcakes with the lil candy canes were adorable. I swear the frosting had a hint of mint to it, frosting is what makes the cake. I actually wish I could roll my body in it, it was THAT good! I am just lucky that this place is so far away from me or I would be there every day.

This is my favorite place in town to do Yoga, yes it's expensive but its all about the atmosphere here. Sure you can take a yoga class at the gym but it's just not the same. This is an actual yoga studio, kids.  I love all the instructors I have been to and I love that they are willing to help you with a pose. They really do a better "teaching" job here than any other place I have been to.  Most of the time they have fun music during the class, sometimes (depending on the instructor...) something will play that doesn't really seem to go with the whole yoga thing...but I guess that makes it kinda fun. I only wish this place had more late night yoga classes (their latest class starts at 735) , for some reason night is the only time of the day I like to practice yoga.  I love to wind down after a long day with a yoga session at At One and I will keep coming back... at least until I use all my classes up.

My favorite ristorante italiano outside of Italy! My two fav reasons to come here is their gnocchi and lemoncello. Their gnocchi is the best I have ever had. It it not too potaoey and doughy like alot of gnocchi. It basically melts in your mouth and is heavenly. The vodka sauce they put over it is just as good. Tomato's, basil, cream and a ton of fresh cracked pepper which I love!  I order this dish ever time I go there because it is just that good. It's a great comfort food! They have alot of other great dishes like the eggplant parm. and of course the lasagna. I have heard that if you like tripe, its also very good here. Me, I tend to stay away from guts!  They make their own lemoncello and I finish every meal with this yummy digestif. Its not too strong and perfectly lemony. I love it!  I also love that this is a small quaint place. You def need reservations to get a table here since there are only like 15 tables here.  The friendly family that owns this place are from southern Italy and they def know how to cook and run a great restaurant. This is the one restaurant I will miss when I leave Scottsdale....

I am "dragged" to this place at least once every 2 weeks by my "dining partner" who loves their steaks. Being the vegetarian that I am, I have never had one but I can find plenty on the menu to eat. ( I do eat fish).  First of all they have the best bread in town. I especially love the pretzel bread. Its hard to keep my hands out of that basket!  Since I am from Michigan, I was surprised to find Lake Superior Whitefish on the menu! My favorite fish! Just because of that they get 5 starts. I love the way they prepare it with the white wine, capers and butter! Yum yum! Basically all of their fish is fantastic but I do have to say for such a quality place, why do they have farm raised Salmon on the menu?? They often do have a "special" of Wild Alaskan though.  As far as the sides,I loved gnocchi and crab until I ate so much of it. Now my fav is the lobster mashed potato's....so decadent! They also have my "favoritest" dessert in town, the warm vanilla cake thing with strawberries. It is a must have and is tooooo die for! Well worth the calories!  Cheers!

This is a decent place that I probably eat at once a week due to its location and quick take out. I like this place because its different then a "normal" pizza place since this is not "normal" pizza. The crust is thin (the "outer" crust is soft and could be much less bready) and sourdough-ish tasting, I like it. It goes well with the Pizza's I usually order which is the Shrimp, lemon and red pepper or the Goat cheese, tomato and sweet red pepper. I might have strange tastes, but I really like these pizza's. They are basically a "personal" size pizza. If I'm famished, I eat the whole thing.  For the meat eaters, I hear the prosciutto one is pretty good.  I haven't really tried much else on the menu beside a salad, since much of the other menu has meat containing items. The veggie salad was ok but could use more flavor.  Any how I'll be back next week.....

First impressions, I was thinking Burmese food was going to be just like Thai food after first glance at the menu. But I was wrong!  We ordered the Green Tea leaf salad for starters.....don't let the look of it scare you. It tasted pretty nutty to my surprise. We also had the "Tobu" salad which was the BEST tofu I have ever had. They don't use Chinese tofu, they use their own Burmese style tofu which was creamy and soooo tasty. I don't know if it was the slightly spicy sauce they used but it was fantastic. I could eat that "salad" (no lettuce in this salad) everyday! My entree was the curry with halibut, which I ordered with the coconut rice. The halibut was cooked perfectly but I ordered the mild curry and I could of gone hotter, so I thought it lacked a little flavor from what I am used to in curries. The coconut rice was worth despite the added calories. Everyone else ordered meat dishes so I didn't get a chance to try them but  they seemed to love them and couldn't stop talking about how flavorful it all was.  I will defiantly be back to "Burma" when I am craving tofu...which could be everyday!  This place is closed on Mondays........

With all the bad reviews the Chandler salon has gotten, I have to say I love the salon at the Borgata! Not only is the salon so cute with its Baroque style decor and all the fun accessories to browse through, the service is excellent. I love my stylist, Nyssa! She transforms my long straight heavy hair into light, bouncy supermodel hair which I get so many complements from, the second I leave her magic chair. I wish I had her at home! I can always get into the salon when I want and they always run on time. What more could you ask for? I still have yet to try out the spa......

I think people who don't know Italian food, enjoy this place. When I first read the menu I was really excited...it did seem like real Italian food and I was excited to try. But once all of our dishes were out and I had bites from each I was no longer excited. I had the Risotto which was actually fairly decently cooked but bland. One friend had the Gnocchi. The size of the Gnocchi were huge and way too potatoey and dry. The pesce di misto was ok but boring. And my friend who ordered the wild boar was not thrilled about it at all. And to top it all off, the waiter had to say something inappropriate to my friend about the cherry in her drink. They also sat us in a back room, where our table was one of those outside metal tables covered with a table cloth. Uncomfortable. So we were not impressed with dinner.  On the lounge side where the Jazz was playing it looked like a great date place for the over 40 crowd and also if you are out cougar hunting. It was packed! The ladies voice was great but the songs were not so great.  Maybe my mom and dad would enjoy this place more than I would......

I love love love this gym. Mind you I have never taken a class here, they always seem to be packed and I'm just not a gym class type of girl. I just love the huge-ness of the place, all the equipment they have and the people watching. That's what makes my boring cardio sessions go by in seconds. It's like "oh, I'm done already". Not to mention the place is super clean, has a "rock" wall (yayyyyyy!) and I love my after workout smoothies at the Lifetime cafe.

I am in love! Oohhh, sorry not with you...but with NOCA! I cannot believe I have not been here sooner. I guess you find love when you least expect it. Since dinner here, I have not stopped thinking and fantasizing about this place.  I knew it was going to be a great time when the charming guy at the door greeted us. We were seated promptly at a great table in the back. The chardonnay I ordered was one I have never tried, now its my new fav. I tried to make a point to remember the name of it but now I forget.. I loved the little spoonful of Gorgonzola cheese mousse with the organic date. It was a tasty tease of what was to come.  I had the lobster roll, which was the most divine thing that has crossed these lips in awhile. It was so full of flavor....limey, creamy, lobstery..yum! I could of done with out the fries, but they were as good as a fry can be covered in aioli dip.  Usually I don't do dessert, especially on the first visit but one look at the menu and I had to have something! I chose the milk and cookies, which sounded fun. And fun and delish it was! The cookies were almost like cake and I enjoyed dipping them into every last drop of the milkshake. Its the desert that I am definitely still thinking about. The cotton candy that they brought out at the end was a really cute touch I thought. I thought that was the end after 2 rounds of dessert but no...they had to really top it of with the chocolate chip shortbread to bring home! What restaurant does that?! Who doesn't like a tasty treat to bring home? So that basically put me over the edge and I had to proclaim my love. Too bad I'm moving out of state....but maybe it's a good thing because I am sure this love affair would cause my waist line to expand.

I have been wanting to try this place for awhile (as I am a rice pudding loverrr) but everytime my friend and I try to go, it's Monday and they are closed!  I am almost sorry that I went, because now I have another treat to crave! I tried alot of the flavors but I liked the coconut and white chocolate the best. This is a treat to eat in moderation as you do get filled pretty quickly. I was starving when I walked in since I had not had lunch and I ate half of a medium. To my surprise the rice pudding is actually good for you as it's gluten free and they make it with skim milk so its not nearly as sinful as ice cream (even though it tastes very sinful).  They have alot of other treats other than the pudding. Ice cream, smoothies, floats and coffee! My friend's 3 year old daughter was not impressed with the pudding so the owner gave her some ice cream who said "it was the yummiest".  If your looking for a new treat to crave, check this place out!

Am I really that picky? I don't like "chain" restaurants much to start with....but I thought I would give them a try.  Ick! Can I say "Houston's" but a few notches below??  First of all, they brought out their "bread" which were the greasiest croissants I have ever had. I had to eat one of course..... I found the menu terribly B-O-R-I-N-G! All the usual boring menu items...nothing fun or exciting. I had the veggie burger. Since the place seemed like a Houston's I thought I would compare. Houston's definitely out shines theirs. It was just ok. My "dinner friend" had their swordfish. It looked like something served at a hospital cafeteria. It did taste just ok. They also have no clue how to make a dirty martini. Hello? Olive Juice, please!  My glass of Hess Chardonnay was thankful not "corked".  The only reason I would come back would be for a glass of wine (or a bottle) since the atmosphere was not bad and it is so close to home.

This is my local "home" gym.  Great routes, that are changed frequently, challenging lead routes and a large bouldering area. The staff is very friendly, always around for questions and safety Nazi's, which is good since they are always on top of the scary newbie belayer's. Members only nights are Tuesday and Thursday. This can be a very crowded time, is it because the men can climb shirtless?? Hmmm...  The weekend can also be a crowded time due to the many kids birthday parties they hold there. But with as many routes as they have, finding a good route is no prob.  The gym also has a decent fitness area with personal trainers and even offer free yoga nights to its members! Lots of great members perks in fact.... All in all I love this gym. The only thing I think they could improve upon is offering more classes. Especially lead climb classes. Maybe some clinics too. Rock on!

This is a fairly new climbing gym and for the newness I was impressed.  There were alot of creative routes which I had fun figuring out and also flailing on! It seemed that the walls were kinda short though, I am not sure how high they are but they seemed shorter than 30 feet. But all the fun routes make up for that. AND then there was the bouldering area upstairs. Boulder-er HEAVEN! It was huge! And I loved the caves! It made me want to be a boulderer again!  All the staff was super friendly as well. My "climbing partner" bought a new pair of shoes from the little shop they have within the gym. The guy working there was really patient and helpful in helping him find the right pair of shoes. As those who climb know, the shoe finding process can take awhile!  One very interesting thing about the gym is that they make alot of their own holds! As I was climbing I thought some of the holds were interesting and ones I have never seen before. I thought that was really cool! Alot of creative minds at this gym and I love it! I will definitely be back to climb max. I just wish it wasn't so far away from where I live!

Lists, list and more lists! To even get into the "family room" you have to be on the "list". To get into the upstairs bars "wet" and "shade" you have to be on another list. So if your not on the list, don't waste your time!  This is a great place for people watching, more so than any other Scottsdale bar. Between the Scottsdale crowd and the hotel guests ( the circus was in town and staying there) it was quite the eclectic crowd! Upstairs on the roof was quite hot and I'm not just talking about the scene. I was wearing a little dress and sweating just standing there..maybe once the weather cools down. I was surprised no one had jumped into the pool! As far as drinks go, I was disappointed that I couldn't order the same drinks upstairs at the bar"wet" as they have downstairs. It was just the typical standard bar drinks.  I loved the ambiance with the lighting and the décor that is typical of all w's. It's a welcome addition the the Scottsdale nightlife "scene". Just make sure your on the list!

This is a great lunch spot that reminds me of this great salad place in San Fran called Pluto's.  I have been wanting there to be a make "your" own salad place to open up in Scottsdale, that is not part of a buffet restaurant and finally.....sigh...it has happened!  So many different "toppings" to choice from, the possibilities are endless! All different types of lettuce, veggies, meats and cheeses to add. They even have tofu for the vegetarians. So I'm a fan!  I am so picky about my dressings but their strawberry balsamic dressing is one of the best I have had. Their other choices sound just as good. They had a great selection of sandwiches and crepe wraps as well. I took a menu home to study....I will be back often!

So the long awaited W has finally opened its doors and so too has Sushi Roku!  My "date" and I stroll in Monday evening and because it had just opened 3 days earlier I was expecting it to be much more crowded then it was. But that was OK.  The whole atmosphere of the restaurant was perfect; dark and sexy until they sat us next to the sushi bar where some type of refrigeration unit was running. I could barely even hear the waitress when she came to our table. She did happily seat us at a table further away from what ever that thing was.  They had a great cocktail list. I had a drink called the fusion which was the perfect blend of berries, watermelon and vodka. It was not overly sweet. They can make a mean dirty Grey goose vodka as well.  The tofu appetizer was to die for, for those that are tofu fanatics. They make their own tofu in house and serve it with truffles, caviar and green onion. Heavenly! The yellow tail appetizer was also good but you can find the same at alot of other sushi places around town.  Now for the Sashimi. Their pieces we cut quite a bit larger than most sushi places but also not cut through all the way so you end up with a huge hunk of fish. We did mention it to the waitress. We also thought the sashimi was not the freshest around. We felt like splashing some water on it to bring it to life! Same goes with the ginger, it appeared freeze dried!  The roll I ordered was one of the best I've had though. It was called something like the Samir. Avocado and spicy tuna rolled in shrimp with rice paper, cilantro and some "hot sauce". Yum-E. It melted in my mouth and did not fall apart between my chop sticks! Impressive!  So overall, I will definitely be visiting this place again. Maybe not for the sashimi but everything else was top par!!

When Metro was Foodbar, it was a descent place to get a sandwhich at lunch. So I thought I would try Metro out for lunch, not realizing it was a french place. French doesn't sit to well with this vegetarian. So that was my first mistake. But I can usually find something appealing on the menu.  There wasn't much for me on the menu.....A few lack luster salads, some cheese but not even a sandwhich! So I ordered the french onion soup. How bad could it be.....b-a-d! First it wasn't soup. It was pretty much bread with onions and cheese. Don't know where the broth went. Maybe the huge "crouton" soaked it all up. My friends lunch didn't look bad. The lack luster salad on the menu actually had some taste with the limited ingredients and her shrimp cocktail looked descent enough.  I would have said this place was 3 stars ( I like the patio) but after the rudeness from the waiter and his eye rolling when I asked about any vegetarian items, it went down to 2. He didn't even say thank you. So I say no thank you to Metro.

I have an addiction to frozen yogurt these days and Yogurt Builderz is a place I have been frequenting. I love how that you can choose your own cup size, your not stuck with a huge bucket to fill up.  The coconut is def my fav but the oreo cookie and vanilla bean are very tasty as well. I guess its all low fat but at this point I really don't care since I will be adding all the sinful toppings! I'm a topping maniac and I pretty much add everything that has chocolate in it. And the mochi which I love! I just pick it off the top of my yogurt and pop them in my mouth and let them melt.....mmmmmm. This place is in a great location in Scottsdale and will def be hopping over the summer!

I was estatic  to try this place out. A new organic/vegetarin/vegan/ HEALTHY restaurant in Phoenix is this girls dream come true!  First of all, I loved the decor and ambiance. Put wheat grass plants in any restaurant and I love it!  I had the harvest salad to start and I must say I want to go back every day just for this. Goat cheese, apples, walnuts, butternut squash and pomegrant-lious! I had the teriayki tofu for my main course. I wasn't as impressed. Teriyaki sauce is not my favorite but I was really craving the tofu, which was good tofu. You can actually substitute tofu for the meat in alot of the dishes, so I really liked that. The drinks are definitely not the focal point of this place, as I did not care for the rye vodka they had (their only vodka).  I will definitely be back again and again....

This by far is one of the best spa's in the "Phoenix" area. Absolutely amazing and breathtaking facility. First of all the place is huge! To get from the reception to the spa area, they walk you up a 300 stairs staircase. Then you walk into this area where you take a stone and make an affirmation type thing. Very zen. Then you walk into this area with a huge glowing crystal before you enter the actual spa part. I already felt relaxed.  The massage was what I needed and worked the areas I needed worked on. She also gave me some nice stretches as well which I have never had a massage therapist do, I liked it.  The spa had all the nice amenities you would expect one to have, the steam room, dry sauna, whirlpool and even an ice cold deluge where you basically dump 50 degree water on to your self! Not for me! They had a nice relaxing room with beds and canopies as well. It was male/female and tres romantic....I  can imagine what has gone on in this room....... The products this spa uses are one of the best smelling spa products (other than Bliss) that I have come across. I regret not bringing any home. Next time I am back in Scottsdale and need a spa experience, I will def go back to Montelucia!

A great new Spanish restaurant in the brand new Intercontinental Hotel in Paradise Valley. Love the ambiance of this place, I feel like I am in some far removed castle somewhere outside Barcelona. The lighting and setting is beautiful.  And the food is as good as Spanish cuisine gets. The octopus salad that we ordered was very small portion wise, like the size of a crab cake. But it was a very tasty little bite. Full of the olive flavors that it was made with.  There were so many tantalizing items on the menu. It was a tough choice between all the paella's and stews. I ended up having the basque cod stew and was delighted with my choice. Usually when I see cod , I am reminded of fish sticks I ate when I was young. But this was not any fish stick cod! It was melty and buttery and went perfect with the veggies in the stew. I could eat this every night. Not only will I be back to eat this wonderful basque cod stew again, I will be back just to chill in their bar and take in the beautiful atmosphere on a lovely AZ winter night.

Thought I would stop by here for lunch. I'm not sure if it's because it's New Years Eve or what but pretty much the whole City North area was dead. It gave me a weird vibe....but my good soup was worthy of the ghost town atmosphere.   In my opinion, Press can definitely replace Starbucks at all these Scottsdale/Phoenix shopping/dining/living areas.  Plus they actually have a lunch menu that is worthy of sampling, so I was psyched!    They had 2 great soups....I had the roasted red pepper and gouda bisque. The gouda totally calmed the red peppery-ness down, yummy! They had a great selection of not your average sandwich- sandwiches. Naturally I had to have "their" version of the grilled cheese. I being the grilled cheese connoisseur, was not that impressed. It was served on a rosemary flat bread that also had a layer of bread between the cheeses. I could do with out that extra layer. Maybe more cheese instead of the bread layer.  I will come back just to try another of their soups, have some wine and sit in the sun and Yelp on my laptop. Hopefully next time there will be more people around so I don't get that weird ghost town vibe.

Yayyy! Self serve frozen yogurt has finally hit Scottsdale! This is one of my fav yogurt places. Their yogurt is great, no chemically after taste and they always have a bunch of yummy flavors on hand. I love the cookies and cream. I also love that they have a gadzillion topping to choose from. One negative thing to say though.... Their toppings in the back are hard to reach for us tall people because of the glass that covers the toppings. I can never reach back there with out bending over, sticking my butt out (basically putting my head under the glass) and looking like a retard. So unfortunately the back toppings are going untouched by me. What a shame. Yogurtology...please raise the glass over the toppings!  They also serve frozen yogurt for dogs! So bring your dog and you can enjoy some delish frozen yogurt together. How sweet!

When I think of last night a few words come to mind.......bubbles, bathtub and Cream? And no, I am not talking about my night after I left the bar.  First lets start with the name of this place...Cream? Just telling my friends to come to Cream grossed me out. It gave me not so good shivers through out my body. I have no clue why its named that. Maybe because the decor is mostly white? I thought the white bar movement was already passe'. The bartenders red bustiers were very unoriginal as well.   Second....the bathtub. When I first saw it I thought.....umm maybe cool? Maybe it's like Tao in Vegas? No..not the case! There was only 1 bathtub in the corner with only 1 girl in it. She wore a white bikini and basically stood in the tub and danced. Lame. For some reason the tub kept running but not filling up with water. What a waste of water! There weren't even any bubbles even though when we walked in it looked like she poured some in. The only reason we stayed there (for like maybe 1/2 hour) was because I kept hoping she would do something with the water, like actually get wet and have some fun with bubbles...but no.... it was quiet ridiculous...a  great laugh!   I do have to give some credit,  this place did just open a few weeks ago; hence the 2 stars for now.  But for a new place in Scottsdale, it was dead around 11 pm.  Maybe it will become the next place to be but for now I think the bathtub will just drain AZ dry.

Can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed yet!  This steakhouse is definitely in my top 5, not because I like the steak but because they have a great fish selection as well.  This is one of those fancy smazy places that serve you the "Compliments of the Chef". It was basically a crouton, with a couple pieces of corn and a smear of corn cream. Funny. But my scallops were done to perfection, cooked just a bit with a pomegranate glaze. Yummy. And they gave me more than 3 which at most places seem to be standard. We had all ordered some sides as well. Since the wine was more than flowing I can't remember what I had other than the brussel sprouts. I can remember eating those since I never eat them but I was forced to try and I actually liked!  I was there with a large crazy drunk group and the waitress held her own around us. Because the sides showed up way after our main course was there she gave our group a free bottle of wine....nice!

So it appears that the poor economy has effected the W. It seems you no longer have to be on the "list". The door guy is excepting $80 in cash for those willing to pay. Are you kidding me? The place is now over run with even more douchebags and boob jobs.  However, I will continue to hang here despite the whole retarded scene. I like to watch the douchebags drool and the couches are comfy.

I went here for a wedding and it was the most amazing location for a wedding in AZ that I have been too. If I ever were to get married in AZ (0% chance of that), this would be the spot where I would want to do it.  This was at just one of the many clubhouses in the Desert Mountain community which is in uber upscale north Scottsdale. The Cochise/geronimo clubhouse was a mixture of contemporary/desert style.  Enormous windows over looking the amazing views of the desert mountains. The Patio was huge and accommodated around 125 people to watch the amazing sunset over the mountains. The food they served was pretty descent for wedding food. I just had the pasta, but the salad was a cucumber avocado salad that was def the most fancy wedding salad I have had.  The bathroom had all the great upscale amenities like mouthwash, sunscreen and lotion.  If you are planning on getting married soon in AZ and have a ton of cash to blow I suggest checking this place out as it will blow your guests away!

A new bar in Scottsdale that is actually worth going to that is not overly pretentious or full of douchebags!  Located in North Scottsdale at DC Ranch, Escape is quite the escape. The space is beautiful and elegant. Inside is the bar area (which actually glows). Friday night it was semi-full with people dancing on the dance floor and a great DJ. He played a great mix of music, from popular stuff to house music to Persian. It was music you don't get bored with.  The area outside on the patio is perfect on a somewhat "cooler" summer Scottsdale night. It was packed full the night I went. Complete with an outdoor fountain it has got the perfect ambiance to go along with the Hookahs that everyone was smoking. They have alot of flavors to choose from that aren't even on the menu. We had the melon. Yummy!  The drinks that were flowing were pretty strong but good. The bartender was good with mixing me just what a wanted (a concoction with bubble vodka, my new fav).  They even have a menu with mediterranean type food if you get hungry after all the drinking and smoking.  Overall, this is a great new hangout with a different and chill vibe. Something that Scottsdale has needed!

Love this place for lunch with my girlfriends. Its def a spot for the "ladies who lunch". I never considered myself  a "lady who lunches" but since I am now being classified as "too old", I will now refer to myself as a "lady who lunches". I might as well start wearing my floral dresses and Sunday hats as well.  This is also the spot to come to on all of the beautiful sunny AZ days, the patio is a fantastic place to sit and enjoy the sun and the accompaniment of your friends. My experience has been that the service is not the best (I had to ask for my creamer to go with my tea twice last time I went) but the food makes up for it. Most every time I go, I have to have the goat cheese and raspberry salad. It feeds my goat cheese addiction. The crab and avocado stack is also pretty tasty. My friend I usually go there with always has the chicken and strawberry salad. I guess the homemade strawberry dressing is "out of this world".  If you like lemon, try the lemon sugar cookies. They have the perfect balance.....not overly sweet. Next time I will be sure to wear my Sunday hat.
