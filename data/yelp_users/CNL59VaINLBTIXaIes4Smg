useI've been bringing my small dog here for last 3 years, and my cat last year. Today we had an appointment at 11 and was called to bring them in early which I did at 10:30. By 3pm I had not received a call so I decided to call and find out why it was taking so long, I had a feeling that they were just holding my cat and dog in a kennel.  So the girl that answered the phone said that my dog and cat are on the table right now, I asked why so late I dropped them off at 10:30, she said there were other animals before mine, I asked why did she want me to bring them in so early, to which she said Oh they are done you can pick them up.  At this point I was concerned at told her that I need them to be done right and not rushed, to which she said yes you can pick them up now.  When I got there by 3:15, my dog like always ran to me and jumped over the little gate, when I tried putting on his collar he pulled away frightened.  I assume they put on shock collar, because I know my dog will not stay still to be groomed.  Although this information was never disclosed to me, I would've at least like to know.  I don't think it's necessary to keep an animal for 5 hours to be groomed, there's no reason for that especially when they take appointments.  The shocker was when they gave me the bill $50 for my dog, which is like always and I always added a tip, but the cat $75 my jaw almost dropped to the floor, when I asked why are they charging me so much for a shampoo, brush and nails, her answer was that's how much I paid last time except for the tips, which I didn't bring in this time and they charged me $10 for the front paws tips.  I think this is totally outrageous price $75 to groom a cat/no hair cut only wash,brush,and nail cut & tips.  I told them that because of the outrageous price and the fact that they don't disclose information I was uncomfortable bringing my dog and cat here anymore.  Also, I tell them everytime I bring my dog that I want his face short/same length as the body not long wiskers, never but never to they do it, I have to sit there and watch them torture my dog to do what I told them in the first place.  Because when I watch they don't put the shocker collar on of course.  I will never return and use Hugs N Pups grooming services again.  I feel sorry that I even recommended my sister to them.

Worst location of Starbucks ever customer service is the poorest. Not only do you have to wait a long time because they do not make your drink as you order but you do not get what you ordered.
