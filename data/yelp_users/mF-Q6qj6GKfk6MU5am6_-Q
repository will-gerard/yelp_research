Where to start?  It seemed nice when first arriving and then wow, how things turned quick.  The registration girl was so mean and rude I wanted to just leave right there.    The rooms are boring, small and not nice.  The sheets on the bed were smoky smelling, so I took them off.  The pillow are terrible.    There was no hot water for a shower in the morning.  The food is miserable and really bad in the restaurant.  The service again lacking very much.  Should have stayed at the Sheraton...never again.

The Orpheum was such a beautiful place and a wonderful venue to see a concert.    The design, art, lighting is all perfect.  There are multiple drink stations with a good selection of everything.    The show we saw was great!  The sound is so good and there doesn't seem to be a bad seat anywhere.  I am already planning to come back for some of the Christmas shows.

A few of us stopped here for happy hour because we heard the patio and the margaritas were great.  This was definitely true!  The patio is perfect: nice tables, feels comfy and ceiling heaters for the chilly nights.  We all ordered Cruz Caddy margaritas since they were on special.  We had chips, salsa and guacamole to go along with our drinks.  Everything was really good.  Our server was lovely, she made sure we were always looked after and had full drinks.

I was really pleased with my visit to RWB.  The service was excellent - our server took great care of us start to finish.  I ordered the stuffed pizza roll with meatballs.  I saw how large it was, but couldn't resist.  It was perfectly cooked with a great crust.  The meatballs were excellent and it had plenty of gooey cheese inside.  The marinara on the side is delicious, so much I had to ask for more.  I definitely will come back when out this way.

We came for the first time because of all the nice reviews and left dis -appointed, -gusted, -approved, -dained.  The people were terrible to us, the place was a mess, we did not get any help or service being it was our first time.  Then when we went to sit down the floor was wet all over and we ended up having to jump around to sit outside.  Apparently the bathroom overflowed per one of the employees.  It probably should have been closed.  The food was nothing special and actually below average.   I ordered one of their sandwiches and it was missing items that were supposed to be on it.  Not to mention they forgot to even make it; I had to go up and ask for them to make it.  The pizza ordered was soggy, greasy and devoid of flavor.   No napkins or silverware was provided.  Nobody bother to check on customers.  The tables were disgusting, I cleaned them myself with alcohol wipes.  In our time there, we noted two other customers who also had bad experiences.  Maybe a bad day, but still unacceptable.  Just not worth the money or time for that kind of experience.  Never again!

It has been some time since my last visit to HoT.  I recall it being very good and I had even recommended it to others.  Not so much anymore.  The food quality was very average.  I had the foie gras starter.  This was so disappointing - it was not a nice piece of fg, it was drowning in an odd sauce and the bread was hard and just not good.    For main course I tried the osso buco, while not bad it was definitely nothing to write home about.  The worst part for me was the service.  The server was unfriendly, cort and seemed to want to rush us away.  At one point I snapped at him because I had enough.    I don't think I'll ever return now.  Kinda sad it was so bad.

Got in for dinner pretty easy considering it was a Saturday night and the casino was packed.  I'm guessing everyone already ate and the rest were getting ready for the night out.  I was greeted quickly and brought a menu and water over.  After seeing some of my neighbors dishes, it was an easy choice for me:  I ordered the combo pan roast.  The server asked me how spicy I wanted the dish....they use a scale of 1-10!!  So that makes it kind of hard to decide...so I just went for a 7.  Chose dirty rice!  Spicy & Dirty!  The dish was huge!  It was loaded with all kinds of goodies...plenty of shrimp to make anyone happy.  BTW...a 7 is not that spicy.  I had to add a little more spice from the sauces they have at the ready.  Along with a nice glass of white wine, this is an almost perfect meal.  Definitely coming back.

Just really good sandwiches that leave you feeling guilty you ate the whole sandwich!  I mostly get the Reuben because it is my weakness.  It is juicy and tasty meat on nice bread.

So much fun and so good!  Started with happy hour and we drank a whole bunch of the seasonal mule(strawberry, balsamic vinegar mix - i think);    For dinner I had the Bavette medium rare which was unbelievably good, along with the risotto and mushrooms sides, I did not ever want to finish.  I so love this place!

I am so happy to find such a nice place.  My wonderful new neighbors invited me to join them recently for happy hour.    The cocktails were so good.  We only had the happy hour food and it was good.   All the people there were so nice.  The bartender not only makes great cocktails but she is an amazing lady and it was so nice to talk with her.  I can't wait to go back.  The menu looks amazing.

Went on a lovely lazy Saturday and chose to sit out on the patio since it was so nice.  The patio is nice, but a little noisy since it is right on the road.  But tolerable. There is also a cornhole spot to pass the time while sipping on some beer.  The only thing is some rude person took their dog to pee on the "grass".    Service was mostly good.  The gal that took care of us was initially a little cold, but then warmed up through the afternoon and we had great fun.  Food was quite good.  The pizza with spicy honey was amazing.  I never thought to put honey on my pizza, but now it may be common!  The only reason I can't give it all 5 stars, is this place is supposed to be a brewery as its first purpose.  The beer was really not that great.  I tried three different ones and they were good, but not AZ Wilderness good.  The sour was the most disappointing because it was boring and flat.  I still would come back - mostly for that pizza!!
