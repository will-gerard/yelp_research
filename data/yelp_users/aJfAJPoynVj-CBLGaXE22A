I don't really have to much to say about Sophie's.  The food wasn't bad, the service wasn't horrible... it's just that my overall experience wasn't what I'd have expected from a restaurant that touts such an amazing reputation for fine French cuisine.  It's not often I leave a place so hungry for the experience I didn't get to have.  . Again, the food was not bad, but I'm not sure If I will ever be back.

I am in a commited realtionship with Seatlle Espresso (located in the EAST valley), but my girl on the westernish side is definetly Mama Java.  Don't get me wrong,  I love Seattle, I'm just not IN love with her anymore.  I need my freedom..    MJ's is an awesome little coffee shop, with tasty treats, good coffee, and very awesome art for sale.   Having an art backround makes me kinda partial to the place, it's so pleasant to be in.  I've only ever had their iced and reg coffee so I need to experiment a little more.     They also have live music from time to time and a bookshelf full of cool stuff to read whilst you amp up on some caf :)

Holy -god damn it - batman - rock n' roll I love LGO.   Even when this bish is rocking hard on a Saturday morning and I'm yanked cause parking here is an absolute cluster (not their fault they kick ass and everyone wants to mow here) I find it feasible to commandeer a table, get coffee/hot chocolate and get my scrumdiddliuptious nummers nom nom'd.   I highly recommend eating a Tammie Coe pastry while waiting for your food.  She makes a crumb bun that will make you weep.  The thing is a religious experience, I swear.    FYI there is no waiter service till 4:00PM.

My GF and I went to Joey's after driving by it for years, but never taking the plunge.  To say we were shocked when we stepped insided was a mucho understatement-o.  The fucker was empty.  It was a wednesday night,  and it was kinda early (6:30pm)  but I expected more than just us and the smattering of blue hairs that were seated.   I don't wanna come off as an ass hat; the staff was super friendly, but this  place was downright C R E E P Y - some would say the decore inside was dated , I'd say  it felt like I was sitting in my grandma's living room.  The lights were off in half the restuarant ( that's not good) , and the A/C  was on the fritz . (or they don't believe in a/c?)   It wasn't swelteringly hot inside, but whaterver cooling system they had running could not keep my swamp ass at bay :(     Lastly, the the food. While hot and ressembling standard issue italian chow, was off in a "alternate dimension kinda" way.   Like a Bizzaro Pizza.  Yeah.   I  felt oogy after I ate it.   Avoid the regular ice tea, it's olive flavored. olive.

Dude.    Bought the basic car wash package for $12.99 + tipped a buck - $13.99 out the door yo.   Imma-gunna play devil's advocate:  I'm dirty; I have a new puppy, I'm a car-eater (and occasional in-seat car dancer, oontz, oontz, oontz).  I usually won't consider washing my green little booger unless it's been at least 6 months.  But my ride was extra dis-gusting this fine day.  Exhibit A:    - Dog-nose snot trails on the windows - Dog hair everywhere - Various pastry crumbs in all seat cracks / crevices. - Used tissues on the floor in the back (dang brah!) - Bird poops all over the outside of the car  So while I didn't spring for the premium-handy of a car wash, I figured the $12.99 deal would handle the bird-shi-at, major chunkage in the carpet n' cracks and get the dog shnoz off my windows.    Errrrrrrrrrrrrrrnnnnnnnnnn.  Nope. Car was mostly poop-less (mostly), and while the dog shnoz had been removed, the vacuuming left something to be desired.  Like for someone to vacuum my car.    Caveat emptor bitches.

Double Iced Mocha.  Possibly a black and white cookie.  I'd buy stock in this company if I could.

Bistro Classic pizza, followed by a pizzookie (ahem.. pizza cookie).   The food is great (It's not down town chicago, but so what?) but the service is UNBELIEVABLY GOOD.  I've been to the other locations and it seems I've had the best service here.  They were SO nice to my 5 year old, and that always goes a long way for a parent who's afraid his child will get bored and turn into a three headed dragon at that table.  I's a comming back that is a fact!

This is hands down the best coffee I've ever had. The baristas are friendly even to anti-social guy like myself.  I once cheated on Seattle Espresso at starbucks, but ended up throwing away my drink and heading over to Seattle anyway.  Try their Iced Moca, but get a double shot of espresso, its worth it! Oh, and their black and white cookies are some of the best I've ever had!  FREE WI FI TOO!

I'm finding it very hard to conjure up good memories about mexican food...  "whats your favorite mexican restaurant?"  **shruggs**  Honestly, with all my visits to Filibertos, Alibertos, Rolibertos, Polibertos, On the Boarder, Chevy's, Arriba's, Nana's, La Parilla Sueza, El Encanto, etc, I cannot say I preffer any of them over the other.  They all mesh together into some big gooey memory of mexican mediocrity.  I mean I like mexican food, I really do, but I guess I've never had a preference to where I have it...  Until now....  I experienced the El Pastor (pork) dish, which had been marinated in a red chile sauce, and was served with rice, refried beans, some pico and a huge ,fresh, HOT flour tortilla.  Delish.  Even my 5 year old who hates ANYTHING that may be remotely caliente was duped into eating some of this... she declared it muy delicioso aswell, but was rather pissed about being tricked into eating mildly spicy food.   I want nacho's next time.    Yes its in a gas station.  So what?  Put your big boy pants on and get you some mexi-luvin.

You know what? I wasn't crazy about the coffee, but I wanted a latte and they don't have latte's (I don't think they had an espresso machine).  They did make me a blended iced mocha drink and honestly, it was pretty good.    Here's the scoop:  I had their black and white cookie. One word D-E-L-I-S-H.   It was thinnner than I'm used to but the cake was SO fresh and the frosting! NOM NOM NOM. I SAyYGOD DAMN! AMEN!  I'll be back. (for the black... and white! booyah!)

People:  This is a hamburger, hotdog, sausage and beef sammich place.  This is not a steak house.  Please act accourdingly.   Also, they ONLY ACCEPT CASH.  Please note this so you don't kink my drive thru expereice (again)  The food here is very good, though I've only ever had the beef sammy and the sausage sammich.  Try the combo, you get beef and sausage together!  TWO DIFFERENT MEATS, ONE SAMMY. So delish.   The owners/employees don't even ask me what I want when I go , they just have my sammy ready at the window; I pay (cash of course) , bid them a "good day " , drive to an undisclosed location so I can unhinge my jaw and then proceed to hoark down that wonderful mound of thinly sliced beef stuffed between two fresh slabs of  meat-juice soaked italian bread .  I think I have wood.

Well well well.  You sneaky, non-descript, awesome little bastard of a restaurant.  Flipped two U-E's before I found you, hiding in plain sight.  Damn it Lux... damn it.   I suppose I'm easy, but I am freakin' smitten with Lux; beautiful, interesting restaurant with tables full of pastries and derishous foodz pumping outta their neat little kitchen that's in plain sight.     Hipster-ish? God damn right, but I'm the furthest thing from hipster and I felt no less love while I was there.  Seems fat white doodz with their bohemian children in tow (bohemian = I let my kid get dressed in the dark) are just as welcome.  It's nice to be pleasantly surprised by an eatery;  Lot-o-hype seems to be circulating about Lux - possibly because a bunch of  ass-hats were overly pumped about a new 'hip eatery' (entrance is dependent on either a  handle-bar mustache or a 1/4 sleeve tattoo).  Not the case; this place is le-jit.   What did I eat? Biscuits and gravy.  Biscuits and mother-freaking, delicioso GRAVY.  Damn, it was fine.  Not the healthiest thing in the world, but my arteries can go fuck themselves.  Unfortunately, with my dish of choice being so filling, I was unable to perform my duties as 'daddy-disposal' - My child's unfinished portion of dutch pancakes, with fresh berries and what I'm assuming was homemade whipped cream was left for the hungry, more than likely neck tattoo'd kitchen staff.  Vultures.   Can't wait to get at Lux again.  Mmmmmm.

I'm going to start by saying I'd have slapped Delux a third star if my burger wasn't so god damned over cooked.  I'm a meat-a-holic (that sounded naughty) and I know what I like.  Fa-reaking rare;  cook the "moo" out and we're good to go.   My sammy was chared on the outside, gray-ish pink on the inside.  Tell Mr. Krabs to fire spongebob and get a wage monkey that can handle temperature orders. (I'd so work here)  All that being said,  the restaurant was nice, though I was sat at the community table (what is with THIS fucking trend? I don't want to sit on a strangers lap...hmmm....) and even though my meat was nuked, it did have some good flavor.  I shall return to Delux in search  of redemtion.  For them.  Yeaaaah.

Pretty good stuff, Though I waited near 30 minutes for a two top :)  The food was good, the hasbrowns , cooked in REAL butter were nice and crispy, the griddle cakes muy deliciouso!  I don't recomend the bacon, as it was a bit undercooked, but do try the honey lemonade! WOWZA!  I am considering going back when it's not so busy.

Allright, this a review based on my SECOND visit to LS.  The first visit was about 2 years ago when LS was first getting into their new digs in Old Town Glendale.  Needless to say both visits were positive, but my second visit was a close encouter of the delicious kind.  I ordered the Pho to go (yo) cause I'm a slave monkey for my company and not allowed to take a "lunch hour"   I tell the waiter "extra meat for a buck please" .  Not only does he NOT forget this like I figured he would,  he separates the meat into it's own little lifeboat so it doesn't cook itself to leather in da broth.  Massive, massive shibby my man.    And such extra meat he gave! (in a very hetero way I assure you).  This was one of the only times I couldn'y finish my Pho off.  Usually I'm bitching and moaning like a 4 year old on ADD meds, but this time I was supremely satisfied and not dissapointed in the carne content of my soup.    Rock on Saigon.  Charlie has definetly secured this area.

My GF and I fluttered over to the WCG the other night.    I was informed that WCG is "reallllly good but kinda pricey".    Pshaw, I laugh in the face of pricey...   (except at Mastro's, then I cry like a little girl).    Walking in, I noticed the  oustide of the place was modern and lemmie tell ya, I like modern.  Well lets say modernish...yeah.  Before we took the plunge inside, I decided to read the gilded framed menu suspended next to the entry door;  while I was reading at least 2 different blue hairs going in had to stop and tell me how FABULOUS the food was .  Hook , line and sinker.  I mean, if you can't believe the old farts, who can you believe?  This place is kinda dark inside. Not deliverance or deer hunter dark, but "I need a night light" sorta dark.  I agree with the other yelper, this place is a nap-danger for adults.  Soup should be served sparingly inside to prevent table drownings.  It was rather nice inside though, I liked it.. just dark.  The booth was nice and squishy too, just the way i like em'.  I had the 6 oz filet, and my dahlin' had the crab cakes.  Both were quite tasty, but my mashed 'taters were kinda sub par considering the price tag. (why are masheds so ignored?? WHY??)  Granted we orderd off the date menu, a fixed price bastard that let us choose 1 app, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert to share.  I'd bore the crap outta you if I went into details about every course, but they were all good in a passable kinda way.  I'm writing this review aren't I?  Irony upon irony, the desserts you could pick from on said "date" menu, even though ALL desserts are listed at the same price, did not include the white chocolate cheese cake.  Black flagged again.  I even tried to substitute and the staunchly refused.  I will get even with them I swear.  Synopsis (sp?)  not bad, but once again AZ has introduced me to another restaurant that I don't want to frequnent often if I don't have too.  I really wanted to love WCG, but I think I'll stick with TGIF's.

Pretty damn good.  I'd say that going on a weeknight you'd see more of the Geriatric crowd there, but who gives a rats ass? This is the guy that smashed Kat Cora's face in on Iron Chef!  His cuisine reigned supreme! :D Anyway I went with my girl, she had the chicken I had the linguine with clams.  Fan-fucking-tastic.  Her chicken was cooked PERFECTLY - they even got the skin ontop nice and crispy.  My pasta was obviosly fresh and the broth/sauce it was served in with clams was soo god damn delish I had to soak it all up with bread before I let the bus boy have my plate.    Desert - very good, I had something made of chocolate, but my dates desert  - the strawberry short cake, on a sweet biscuit was a bit sour and not as sweet as we hoped. NOT bad by any stretch, but not what we were thinking it'd be.  The waitress promptly took it off the bill when we told her we didn't like it, saying she wants us to love our experience and to come back!  RAWK ON! Tarbell's FTW!!

I just had a cookie.  It was the equivalent to recieving oral sex.  I apologize, in advance, for my rather obscene remark, but these cookies are that 'effing good.    I supported it by buying 5 cookies.  I went back insideafter eating my first to tell the owner it was the best I ever had.  It is not my fault that this place can bake orgasms into cookies.  I too would like a world where there were cookie stores on every block.  Particularly Urban Cookies.  I'm happy.

UPDATE: I went back.  The next day.  I know.  My slighty creepy patronage was rewarded with a sample their "Urban Cookie" with dark chocolate, walnuts and a wee bit of coconut.  I was still comming off the crack like halucinations I recieved from the "Simple Urban" when I decided to nibble on this bad mo fo.  It was a HUGE mistake to think I could just take a bite of this cookie and then put down.   I mean, I had just scarfed lunch, and was stuffed so there was no way I should want to eat.    I transformed into a emaciated ethiopian getting their first red cross rations from rich fat missionaries.  I did not eat the cookie, I unhinged my jaw and assimilated it.    Are you kidding me? My first cookie wasn't a gimmic ?  Aren't places like this suppose to have ONE good food item and the rest are suppose to be mediocre to appease the tards that hate good food?  Are you kidding me?

While the price was lower than average for the area it's in (north scottsdale / cave creek) and the the pizza was ready ontime, it was definetly not worth the savings.  This was one of the worst pizza's I've ever had.  My father and I decided to throw the entire thing away after eating just one slice a piece.  I thought the crust was decent, but the sauce tasted like it was out of a can, the cheese tasted like plastic, and the chicken I got on my pizza (yes, I like chicken on my pizza) was a deepfried cutlet that was sliced up and placed ontop.  Eat at your own risk.

I wish I could throw a "zero" onto this update.   Not surprised I didn't like the chicken on my pizza here?   I also didn't like the stuff that was under the chicken.  Never in my life as a doughy white Italian have I thrown a pizza away.  My pups wouldn't even eat it.    I wasn't asking much, and Number 1 Brothers Pizza delivered.  Usually I wouldn't update on a restaurant of this caliber, but I can't help myself when the mediocre stand up for their own.     I'm not sure how you can defend the goodness of said pizzeria by summarizing:   "[of course what you picked was bad! you should have known better and ordered something mediocre that we "regular" folk like!]"   Seriously?   Ultimately I have to give N1BP  credit for staying open during the economic apocalypse.   If mediocrity were a business model, it's surely the compass that N1BP steers it's ship with and that seems to be working for them.  Maybe they can hang out with the doods over at Five Guys Burgers trade average tales about average customers who spend average amounts of money on food that leaves them feeling average.    Nice weather we're having.

This place is cozy. Like my grandma's house without the horrible old person smells.  I liked it, and by golly i think I'm a going to go back. It's in old town Glendale, which can be kinda sketchy at night if you ask me, but the place is spotless and the people inside are very nice.  I think it has WIFI too, but what coffee place doesn't now a days?  The iced latte I got was bitchenly powerful, just how I like it.

I live near by.  I love me some burritos.    I love me some carnitas.   I love me some carnitas burritos.   I have a healthy fear of carnitas, but not from here.    Lil' dirty, (not like nasty, but obviously not OCC about shit here), little hokey inside ('cept the bathroom door - art nouveau shit is tiiiiight) - putting my Bob Ross hat on for a min... I'd say a wee bit o' nepotism is prevalent; e.g. someone's neurotic auntie got the nod to hang their interpretation of modern 'Mehican'.  Regardless, I'll be god damned if I'm not here at least once a week.    Open at the butt crack o' dawn (6:30am)  slinging chorizo and egg 'ritos, delivering scrumtacular nacho-quesadi-lladas at night  (like 5:30pm - 9:00pm...ish).  Set the bong down, and give em' a call.     Repeat after me:  'I'd like the carnitas burrito'    Skadoosh

Review Disclaimer :  I have NOT tried their pizza.    Allrighty then... I've eaten at La Piazza al Forno twice now and had a pasta dish both times.   The first time was clams over linguine in a spicy red sauce, the second the chicken pesto lasagna.  Big MEH.     I've worked in the glendale area for about 10 years and have seen this location reincarnated a few times, with LPAF as it's most recent scion.  I'll have to say it's probably the best thing that has ever filled said space, but I don't think it merits the praise it's been given by the locals, by other Yelpers and certainly not that of Guy Fieri of DDD. ( The restaurant advertises the fact that Guy visited them.  With a big vinyl banner outside... and on their menus.  I totally agree... this place does NOT qualify as a diner, a drive in or a dive.  I mean come on, did you see the  episiode?  It looked like Guy was faking his food lust for the cameras.  You can't fake that!  Food is like porn to senior bleach bucket.  Seriously.)  Anyway, both pasta dishes I had were average.  Nothing to write home to mom about.  There service was good at the restaurant and the owner was nice to me.  I just wish the food was better.  Again, I have NOT tried the pizza, so perhaps my two star rating is a bit hasty.    The lasagna feels like a fire roasted brick in my tummy.   I will stick with Uncle Louie Pizza up north.

Holy crap their pizza is fucking good.  I had the "good fella" with proscuttio (sp?) ham.  Holy monkey ! l I ate over half the pie, I was almost sick., but could'nt stop.  Consider my foot inserted in my mouth for prior review... though I don't think I'd ever order their pasta again.

Once again, the pizza was delish. They were super busy last time I went, and my gf and I had to wait a while to see a server, but they apologized for the wait, gave us two free sodas and were understanding that we needed our food to go ( Kick-Ass started in like 30 minutes!).  Very cool.

Damn. I thought I had reviewed SP already.  Could be that it's 6 am on a sunday and I haven't gone to sleep yet.  Kids, gotta love em'. Or put them up for adoption.    Where to begin, where to begin...  First:   Name -   SPICY PICKLE -  A W E S O M E  S A U C E.  All you ass hats that don't like the name, don't fucking eat here.  Hey, I'm not a pickle fan either, but that doesn't stop me deep throating their sammiches. (insert gay joke here).  They could'a called the place "Red Hot Fermented Cucumber".  Yeah, that's nice...  FYI,  They also have a table that resembles a pickle;  not just shaped like pickle, but RESEMBLES a god damn, translucent green Mother effin' pickle. Gigity.      Second:    Food    -    The first time I ate here, I had a turkey samich with some corn on it and some mildly spicey salsa.  It didn't create the euphoric mexican high I had hoped for, but I remember thinking "damn that is one freshly made sammy"  Fresh...  F - R - E - S - H.   No, none of that "Subway, eat fresh" crapola, I mean fresh like they may have a veggie garden in the back and or a little chicken coop on the roof.  The bad larry did manage to give my tummy a workout later, if you catch my drift, but I'd still eat here again (and again (and again)), it's not like it was Chipotle's carnitas burrito...  I've also thad the pleasure of masticating their italian sammy;  chalk full o' meaty, cheesy goodness.   mmmmm, meat and cheese, on warm, grilled bread.. Wait, didn't I I read someone elses SP review about the bread being too hard to chew? WTF is that about?  I here-by offer my services as  "step in chewer" to any sally who can't handle the SP's pannini bread.     Conclusion:  - This place is bitchen.  The service has always been excellent, and the food has consistently been the same, delish,satisfying fair that keeps a fat, white mo-fo like me comming back for more, and the restaurant itself is a pleasure to eat in.     STEEEEEEEVE.

To all of you Over- Easy haters. Get bent.  Honestly, if this place was so bad, why give it two stars instead of one? If you going to get all Office Space on somthin' , put your big-boy pants on and drop the friggen' hammer! Also don't write a review just because they were closed when you had a snack attack and it fizzed you.   This is A M E R I C A, not communist china  (YOU EAT EGG NOW!) the proprietors of this fine establishment can open and close as they see fit.  And to finish, this place is the king, better than Matt's.  I like Matt's but it is Over Easy's bitch.  Squirell style.

Please stop reading my Yelp and go here. NOW.  The food is pretty good, the fries are fried in LARD, which may sound disgusting but is 'Effing delish.  The waitresses are cute little naughty nurses, barely dressed,  that will sit and flirt with you no matter how fat n' ugly you are. They have burgers, fries, coke, beer, a full bar (?) and smokes (lucky strikes baby).  This is not a kid friendly place nor is it a good idea to bring the Mrs. here for your aniversary dinner.  But go, and you shall be rewarded.  Also if you finish (or attempt at the very least) a double, triple or quadruple bypass burger they wheelchair you out to your car.  Awesomeness ; free of charge.

This is my new new restaurant to stalk.  After being seated in a comfy 'lil booth, we were greated by our beatnik waiter Eric; a pretty cool cat.  He was astonished we'd never been to HIS restaurant and was very very interested in sharing his love and lore of it with us.   I was a bit put off at first cause i thought he was being a knob, but soon realized he wasn't there to fuck around.   The terms "fresh" and "farm to plate" have been etch into my brain thanks  to this tattoo'd hipster food slinger.     To continue, my girlfriend and I went on a Wednesday night and were delighted to be in a chow casa that was wasn't leaking people back onto the sidewalks.  Eric insisted we try "farm to table"  an appetizer that includes mushrooms, asparagus and a fried egg all ontop a piece of  brioche to start.  I was waaaaaay skeptical about eating something like that, but as soon as that bad mamba jamba hit the table my girlfriend and I ravenously devoured it.  It was so fresh and it tasted good! I know that's a pretty vauge way to say it rock'd my pants off, but I just had NO complaints!  I'd eat a "farm to table" everyday if I could.  Oh, and the asparagus made my pee smell funny, free of charge! :D  Our entree's were no less impressive, with my lady having the fettucini with brased pork and I having the cannelloni with crispy pork belly.  The fettucini was green!  It was soo god damn delish too! I liked the pork in the dish, but I could not get over the flavor of the pasta! Muah! Muah! (Itallian finger puppet kissing)  The pork belly... I mean c'mon!... was crispy and as I delved into it's layers was salty and tender, and finally rich and fatty... oh god, I feel like I need to go to confession.  And I'm an atheist.  Jesus Christ.   Ok, at this point the server was like "yeah bitch, I told you" and I was like "yeah I am your bitch, feed me your awesome 'effing food"    It was ridiculous how good everything was, specifically how F R E S H everything was.  I don't really eat veggies as a rule, I like them, but I don't normally chow on them.  At Digestif, I could have eaten ONLY veggies.   I didn't get to sample the dessert menu, or try any of their wines, but i know that i will be back.

You know, after experiencing True Foods and some other restaurants Fox Restaurant Concepts have plated up for me, I was reticent to eat at Sauce.  Yeah, well fuck that goofiness.  Sauce is sauce-tacular, sauce-sational, sauce-ariffic even.    Man this is turning into a weak-sauce review (ba-dum-chee).  I'm not drunk or high or anything, I just can't think of anything else that'll make this baby pop, you know?  Lets see, me old lady and me had a cheese pizza and a salad.  Thank god she only ate a few slices cause I felt the need to scarf her half of the pie in addition to mine.  And I'd say I ate a good quarter of her salad. NOM NOM NOM.   Like a fat kid at a fatty camp.    So overall, two thumbs up.  I need to try to get sauced here the next time I'm here.    Sauce.

Hmmm.. Well this place is pretty damn good.  I mean it's freaking nice inside and out and they have a lil' market 'down stairs' where you can buy some of their pre-made food items (and cheese! and snacks! like they're freaking awesome sweet potatoe chips!) :D  I was all smiles with my turkey wrap (I fucking hate wraps, but my doctor suggested less bready options cause I'm ::cough::  :: cough:: ::over weight:: ::cough::)  As Arnold would say "Ahl be bock"

BEST GELATO EVER.    SEA SALT CARAMEL + CHOCOLATE and you're talking a possible rival to Urban Cookies.  I don't say things like this lightly.    Have you ever tasted cold?? O' come on!  It's comments like that that will keep baskin robbins / cold stone  on the "this is the shiz-nit!" list but keep places as awesome as Paciugo on the "my tastebuds are too retarded to enjoy something good, so I won't go here" list.  The mob cries for it's bland crappy ice cream and flocks to places like Dariy Queen to get it's fix.  What a shame (though I can appreciate the business aspect) that the Walmart's of ice cream get top billing while the Apple's of ice cream get the wiener in the bum. (insert gay joke here)  Damn I loved this place.

I swore off wildflower many years ago after a tuna sammich gone wrong. Then, out of desperate hunger, and the need to not be near so many people, I stumbled into above listed location. Boy was I impressed. I had what is now known as the Salmon Alfredo (formerly the smoked salmon Alfredo). God damn delish, albeit a bit to much to wolf down in one sitting. The more updated dish incorporates fresh grilled salmon (outta the ocean? I dunno and there are grill marks on the meat) instead of the prepackaged smoke salmon (which I thought was very good, but obviously not fresh) over fettuccine/linguine in a very fresh white sauce. Inter-dispersed throughout the dish are sun dried tomatoes and capers, one lending a sweet tang the other like crisp, squirty little nuggets of salty goodness. Hmm.. that sounded a little gay... Oh and lets not forget the fresh Parm grated on top. Amazing. I like the toasted fresh Artisan bread too that comes with the meal, very tasty and good for sopping up sauce.   And if you get the chance to have breakfast there, try the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. The first 3-4 times you have them you will be amazed! Specially with the blueberry compote and fresh whipped butter. :) I have to say I'm getting bit tired of them and am looking forward to something new on their breakfast menu :)

This little dandy caught my eye the other night, and of course, me thinking it was "French" I put on my big boy pants and expected to be WOWED.   I was not wowed.   Don't get me wrong. The restaurant was clean and pleasant to be in, and the service was good. The food however was..... so so. I ordered a salmon dish on recommendation from the owner (or the man as a perceived as the owner... he was a nice little Asian guy ^_^ ) It came with a salad that had a nice, sweet vinaigrette that tasted of ginger. But no bread.  None.    I need bread. I'm a chunky white man. Bread good. Where bread go?   to continue:  When I got my main course, I found that my salmon was a bit over cooked, and the sauce they had placed over the fish was ice cold. :( Now here's the thing; The sauce may need to be served cold and I'm a tard for saying otherwise.  Lemmie tell ya though, I don't do hot meat and cold sauce. I'm either all hot, or all cold - there is no in between. It's just how I roll. Anyway... The salmon was edible, but nothing to rave over, and the sauce was cold, but kinda tasty. The potatoes were delish.. I'm hard pressed to find a potato that I don't like, but these were fresh, "smashed" red skin potatoes and I enjoyed them very much. :)   All in all, it may be worth another shot, but I'd have to be convinced to go back. Or have Megan Fox INSIST I bring her here. yeah.. that would work.

Hmmm... what to say about True Food Kitchen.  It seems to have take Coffee Plantation's spot at the Biltmore Shopping Center (Coffee Plantation sucked donkey) so Hooray!    TFK  looks fucking sweet from the outside with its floor to ceiling window/walls, but  it's a bit of a tangle on the inside.  While I can see what the owners/desingers where aiming at (wait maybe I can't I've never designed a restaurant...)  ,  I could not find a unifying theme for all of the decorative elements inside. Neon green tiles near the open kitchen , 70's wood pannel lamps in the dinning room, dark stone near the bathroom, and astro turf covering the hostess stand.  The place feels like a mix between fresh and easy and put-put golf.  The wait staff were dressed like car-hops working a veggy-brave-new-world drive thu..  I did like the wobbly butcher block tables.  Neat.    So who gives a crap about how a restaurant looks right?  I'm in it for the food.  I had the ahi tuna sliders (rare of course) with a side of sweet potatoe hash.  Sliders = derishious.  SPH = sadness :(  I loved the tuna, but god damn if the hash didn't come off as icky.   My date had the Teriyaki chicken with bown rice and veggies.  The chicken was overcooked and the bed of rice it came served over was saturated in Teryakie sauce that was rather tasty but became snail killing salty after 3 bites.  She also caught a snag of hot pepper on her first bite that made her scared the dish was spicy.  Keepy Spicey Separately.    Overall it was edible.  Have I had better?  Yup.  Do they have delish drink options, like natural ginger ale and organic honey lemonade? yesh!   But will all the neat stuff about this place and the fact that, like the Tuck Shop, they don't charge and arm and a leg, I still don't see myself ever comming back.  .

I'm writing this review first, then will slap some stars to it.   I was wicked excited to go to Tuck Shop.  I suppose you could consider me a foodie, but I think I'm just a guy who likes neat places to eat.  Tuck is a neat little place :)    When I arrived with my lovely date, we were greated promtly and sat at a nice little 2-top near the back.  The restaurant has a pretty interesting feature, in the middle there's a big-ol community table that one can sit at and eat with strangers. Not my bag, but I'm sure some people like it.  And it seems that Tuck Shop's theme centers around sharing your entree's so why the eff not?  I had  HOMEMADE GINGER ALE. HOMEMADE! How cool is that? I geeked out hard and had two glasses of the stuff.  Kinda spicy-sweet and refreshing, like what a ginger ale commercial leads you to believe IT'S drink will taste like !  My date had their fresh squeezed lemonade.  It was fuerte, a little to much so for her, but I kinda liked it.  Her, not so much.   Appetizer: Cheese sticks.  I know, kinda bar food ish right? WRONG. Fucking amazing Gruere (sp?) cheese, panko bread crumbs and crushed walnuts all fried together in a glorius miniature twinkie shaped goo- jem made just for my mouth (again, a little gay there).  Served with Pur'reid (SP? I need to work on my SP)  pear and onion dip.  Holy monkey. I am officially a cheese stick snob.  Entree's:  We got two of the larger entree's, I got the citrus brined friend chicken with cheddar waffles, and she had the maple pork with carmalized pear chips and gargonzola grits.  Now, I liked the waffle, it was moist and buttery, but the chicken, while flavorfull, was coated in something that made it rock hard.  I also though the pollo was a bit over cooked , but I know most restaurants have to over cook the white meats cause they're scared of undercooking it.  I'd give the chicken and waffles one thumb up.   My date's entree of pork was cooked magnificently, not over done at all, but the pear chips where kinda gross, almost too loaded with taste and the grits that came with them were, in my opinion, inedible.  They were loaded with what seemed to me to be scallion and black pepper.  I was not a happy camper. Usually when I get me a bowl of something warm, mashed up and covered in cheese and butter I'm one satisfied 4 year old.  Not the case here.  Suprised that something could taste so off in a place like this.  However, since I don't have the most mature pallete , it could just be me.  I'm just a white guy that likes to eat :) The pork also recieved one thumb up.  No dessert, but they gave us cookie dough with our bill! Killer!  It had an unusual ingredient in it that I couldn't place, but I thought it was as a finisher, a really nice touch.  The dinner wasn't irrationally priced either!  I might come back, but I don't think I will rush to do so :) Three stars I think. (UPDATE! 1-16-11! FOUR STARS! WTF TOOK ME SO LONG!?!)

This place is close to my parents house in Cave Creek and whenever I'd drive by the joint looked deserted; like and Iraqi restaurant or something... Big misnomer. I went a few weeks ago and all I can say is WOW. Fresh, tasty and reasonably priced. EVERYTHING tasted fresh and was cooked to order. The margarita pizza combined with spicy Italian sausage comes off a bit salty, but hey, that's how I roll. I highly recommend them! (yes I edited this review. I didn't like my first one)

Jesus H Christ Cracker and Co...  My last visit to your 'tukee establishment was a year or so ago and I was served DERISHOUS pankcakes, some mediocre bacon (still Nom'd it)  and some down right gnarly coffee.  Your service blew goats, but you were standing room only.  Overall I'd have given you 3.5 stars, cause I didn't hoark up my chow.     I return a year later-ish, on a lark (what a great fucking word; lark) and order eggs benny, my absolute fav.  This is the ultimate litmus test for any breakfast place IMO.  Simpy, I put my heart in your mouth C&C... your mouth.  (I have massive trust issues).  So....  I'd never tasted yellow ketchup 'till I had  me some Eggs Benny ala Crackers (hollan-NOT), but my REAL beef was with the  "pork product" stand-in (double meat entendre!).  Instead of using my beloved hoser-ham as your default, this butchered benny was garnished with  leftover meat cylinders from a 'lunchable'.  How dare you sir; how. dare. you.    Did I eat the dish?  Ashamedly so, I settled for this monstrosity, like a frat boy at last call.  Did I feel like purging afterwards? Well, no, but I did feel like I was leaving a coyote ugly soiree at 6 am.  With 'bad breakfast hair' if you get my meaning.       Your service once again blew [insert farm animal of choice].  Server was nice and obviously overloaded, wasn't his fault the food was so 'Five Guys'.  And for fuck's sake, please stop charging 2.98$ for a small glass of milk - shit ain't gasoline guys.

Holy monkey.  Talk about a place that, originally, I had no interest in going to.  However my friend whom is a master at introducing me to things that are awesome yet inconspicuous, told me this place was 'legit'.    And this place IS mos' def' effin' LEGIT.  You get a freshly baked 'wee pie'  (wee is the word I use for fucking huge) filled with amazingly fresh ingredients, tossed in front of you and served with spectacular 'red wine gravy'  which is a badass entity unto itself.   Dude, It is impossible to not gorge here.  NOM NOM TIME!  CPC has a huuuuge selection of interesting love pockets, even a dessert selection! And to my amazement, a WHOLE page dedicated to you retards who are vegan.  Pretty shanzy if I do say so.  And I do. Say. So.    One ITSY BITSY critique:  Please please please come take my order BEFORE I sit in front the chefs making the damn delish pasties for 20 minutos.  I love hearing from and watching the people who craft my food, but not when I know I may die of hunger waiting for my waiter to take my fa-reaking order.   Holy fuck,  I get it if you're busy, but on a monday afternoon??  I need food. I'm a 'stocky' (euphemism for tubby) white guy, I needs to eat.  Your pasties, while divine, take like another 20+ minutes to bake!  Hear my roar of hungers good employees of CPC! (roar) Order taking and scarffing MUST COMMENCE  within 30 minutes (or less) of my  hairy bean bag of an ass making contact with said sitting apparatus of my choosing.     Regardless of my impatience, You 'effing ROCK CPC! I'll be back!

Dude.    Went back to CPC.    Ordered taken quickly, got me some hibiscus tea (wtf pink drink?  it's awesome).     HOWEVER, there was a mixup with my order.       Break it down:   SAME day of the week, SAME server as last time, DIFFERENT location in restaurant (outside table with squishy seats) NEW, BIGGER issue than last time.... but... was it really?       And of course you're asking, why a FIVER now?      Lemmie 'splain:   Even though things went sideways, our waitress did not falter under the pressure of said 'eff up.  She didn't avoid the issue or ignore my table and  she brought me a SECOND pasty for FREE along with my original (but slightly late) order.  Her course correction was done in record time (10 minutes or less), pretty amazing considering Pasty's take somewhere in the neighborhood of 20-30 mintues to cook (I could be wrong with my timing here)     Conclusion:  Ku-fucking-dos CPC.  Open mouth, insert foot via my original critique. I'm now CPC'S BFL (bitch for life).   :::Cabbage Patch:::

I drove by. Twice.  "Is that little blue drive-thru selling coffee?"  So I pull up, VERY afraid, thinking "Mariscos De Isla De Capitan Drive-thru that sells coffee"    "I need something with a lot of caffeeine and not a lot of sugar" I says to the barkeep  "Oh, I gotcha covered my man"  2 seconds later I'm quaffing my quad-shot (4) espresso and milk concoction and freaking out with caffeine induced halucinations.  I was amping for 4 hours solid. God DAMN!  AMEN BROTHAS!  Simply put, I was blown away by  kick ass java, excellent service and reasonable prices.

Stopped here one morning cause it's on my way to work.  I always see a lot of police cars there, and figure if the cops are eating there religiously then it's gotta be worth a shot.  Meh.   Honestly, after seeing them make my iced mocha with hershy's syrup I became distraught, but when I tasted it I was pleasantly suprised.  Probably the best "hershy mocha" I've ever had.     The fried egg sandwich with bacon was a cluster.  FRIED implies..  well fried, NOT SCRAMBLED.  Sorry for the caps usuage but  I was just terribly dissapointed.  My scramble stack of blandness on bread was a catastrophy.   I might come back so I can try something else and boost the rating.  They only take cash too... a bummer cause I only carry my card (so I don't spend all my cash).  The restaurant in convieniently located next to the I-17 and Bethany Home Rd, and is pretty cool little place on the inside.  The owner was very nice and the prices are low.    Meh.

I have not tried their food, but in the middle of stuffy Cave Creek with the well-to-do (possibley the owner of this fine establishment belongs to this social demographic?) I was presented with the STRONGEST and most delicious quad-shot, 32 Oz espresso drink I've ever had.  So totally did not expect to find that here.  The staff was nice and friendly, but with a "don't fuck with me or I will hand you your ass" edge...  Very awesome.  The restaurant is fucking killer , I love the design and feel of it.  Going inside is like walking inside your dad's garagewhile he's working on his hot rod,  and sharing a sandwich with him.  My kid loved it too, probably cause the lady behind the counter slid her a mammoth sized chocolate milk topped with whipped cream.

I had the privellage of working at this establishment for a short period of time, and got to sample most of the food.  I'd have to say I learned a lot, especially that I was a horrible employee.  Even though it was  a bit rough for me,  I absolutely loved the food.  Haven't been in a while, but the Angel Hair Pescatori (I would sub linguine if I were you) was/is one of the greatest things I've ever put in my mouth.  It's been atleast 5 years since I've been and a good 5 before that, but if Michael is still cooking (such an ass, but awesome at what he does) get your butt here and eat!

Well well well.  I see there ARE Uncle Louie haters.  Hmmm... I will say, not everything on their menu is awesome, but some of what they are dishing out borders on the divine.  Am I biased? You bet your ass I am.  I grew up with the original UL and have never been dissapointed by their food.  Is this Gordon Effing' Ramsay cooking here? No, but Chef Michael (whom I SAW in the kitchen freaking cooking) is there making the same, delish food that I remember from the old location + a few new things I've never seen before (hooray for sweet potatoe fries!!)  I agree, the staff there seems a bit new, and yes the guy with the sexy accent brought me a diet coke instead of a regular one.  2 times.  But hey, I'm not here to bag on the service I'm here to rave about the fact that I can get my angel hair al pescatore, with linguine THAT much closer to home now and it's STILL outta this world.  Chef Michael? Certifiable ass-hat.  Lou and Marie? Lush bags, but they sure the fuck know how to run a restaurant.  Is this a fair review? Hell no. It's MY review. Deal.  Oh, and if you can, get a Blue Bomber pizza to go, holy monkey.

I fucking love "The Parlor".  Love it.   What ever Joe Pesci wiss sack decided ta toss fresh herbs and  prosciutto onta cracker thin crust with  fresh motz is a credit to the race we callz peoples.  God damn, my taste buds were smoking... in a good way...like a 'after wild monkey sex' kinda smoking.   And holy fo-shizzle, try their zepolle with salted caramel sauce.  I think I need new underroos.    Don't forget to get meat. And Cheese. Together. Before or after your orgasmic pizza adventure.   Wine list ain't too shabby neither.   I love you Parlor.  Right here, in my arteries. Mmmmmmmmmmm.

How can you not love a lil' ol' Italian man scooping out gelato and regaling you with tales from the old country? I couldn't understand a god damn thing he said, but man he was nice - and he gave me salted caramel gelato - fuck yes.  The place is small, but awesome - it's family own/run/oriented.  Pretty sure they have a baseball bat behind the counter to club any nay say'ers.  You've been warned.

I hate hate hate that I have to dole out a fiver to Hillside Spot - To quote the paranoid pot dealing hippie from ''Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle', It's my baby.    HSS rotates a variety of killer local and  semi-local handles and, regardless of how overly complicated their menu is, the food fucking rocks. (see that side o' roasted corn? Get that shit.  It will change you).   HSS is a strange yet wonderful beast.  It's either crammed to the rafters randomly in the middle of the week or oddly (and gorgeously) bereft of any and all humanity.  The later is especially nice when I roll in after any form of exercise I deem 'worthy of a beer'.  Long story short, if you haven't tried it, try it.  But not when I'm there.  This is getting uncomfortable.

Holy let down batman.   I totally got sucked into the "Five Guys hype": reading the owner's story about opening the restaurant with his kids:  how he doesn't spend much on the restaurants themselves, but instead focuses on the quality of the food:  How they don't deliver, that nothing is frozen, etc.  But above all how good their food is.   Mr. Boss of all Five Guys franchises:  Please visit your restaurants.    In and Out  = better than Five guys  Smashburger  = better than Five guys  Delux   = better than Five guys  Fat Burger  = better than Five guys    McDonalds  = better than Five guys   Perfect (twice fried) french fries?  Soggy mess.  Fresh ingredients?  I can't disprove this, but to cook said ingredients to death and then dress them up with "as many condiments as I want" ? No high five for you. It's like offering me fancy ketchup with my well-well done filet mignon. (though to be fair, most places cook everything to well done... it was just a mess here though)   And the kiss?  I paid 5 bucks for said tasteless krabby patty of woe.  I went in to the restaurant thinking:    WOW ME 5 GUYS, FUCKING WOW ME.     Thats all I wanted!  Give me a reason to come back!  I can't believe you formula for success is to bank on the masses having mediocre taste buds.  Can't say this isn't the right formula for success, but come-fucking-on!

Dude - I waited and waited for this place to open.  I always wanted to hit their food truck, but I was either too lazy or my timing sucked, so when I heard they were opening a non-mobile version I was pumped.    DE-LISH, however my group ordered ALL of their sweet offerings at once - don't do this.  I saw the breakfast burrito at another table and immediately licked my chops in salty envy.  This is not to say their candied crepes weren't good; they fucking rocked - just make sure you mix it up.  There coffee was bisn'nly caffeinated, I was higher than ... well you know the rest.  Get jo' ass here and eat the num nums.

You ever fall in love? Like 'holy shit why the fuck am I  smiling all the time' kinda love?  Well, to my 1 to 2 crazy readers, this is a confession; I'm going to be with Crepe Bar, for-evs'.  (queue Psycho shower scene)  Seriously I think I've attained regular status here. The staff give me the 'heeeey...you're back...again' look when I walk in.  Not going to lie, kinda like it (and chiggity-check all them 'check ins'!).  You know what they say about creepy, unrequited love though...it's creepy.    Not sure if I stressed this in the original review (or even mentioned it) but get the breakfast burrito.  Damn it's fine n' tasty.  Also, after you've had their coffee, you may decide to cheat on/break up with your current coffee relationship (Seattle, I'm sorry...but it's over. I love Crepe Bar now.  shhhhhh).    And Jesus-H Christ they're serving fresh baked cookies now?; I'm fucked.  Should have engagement ring all set for next Thurs (fingers crossed!).    To the naysayers and ass-bags:  If you don't approve of their 'portion size', can't appreciate these peeps love for food or don't like the fucking rad art on their walls, then hit  up a different restaurant so I can have your table (their busy as crap lately).

Got an oil change and wash - I will say these guys are efficient; they know their craft - my oil was changed and my car washed in less than half an hour.  That being said, I was not thrilled with Cobblestones 'fear mongering' up-sell technique once they got my car into the oil change pit.  Dude, my car is a 'hoopty', I will drive it till the wheels fall off.  I'm burning oil and tranny fluid you say? Derp! My car is 14 years old, with almost 200k miles on it!! My drive belts are cracking?!? No shit, we live in, its hot as fuck, AZ senior rhode scholar.  I get it, they're just doing their job, but I just hate it when people trying selling me shit by scaring me - I'm already enough of an asshole, I don't need to be a scared asshole too.  And to finish this bad boy - it's like a card carrying OCD member cleaned my ride - shit is ka-lean.  Regardless of me not liking their bedside manner in the oil change dept, ill be back.

Per my last visit, CAS,  you changed my oil and washed my hoopty.   So. Goddamn.  Good. (minus the fire and brimstone lecture).   With high hopes I came back with my  new albeit extremely economical ride, but somehow you couldn't figure out how to get the crumbs outta my cavernous cup holders (Big Gulp / Polar Pop accommodating).  My shit was sparkling on the outside , but  after I looked under my  floor mats (anal-retentive, I know) it became obviously I 'choose poorly' concerning the 'basic' car washy package.  Maybe, next time, move the floor mats around a bit? - let me know you tried. I thought about re-vacuuming when I got home, but I'm lazy and fat - hence me paying for the suds.     What a' Picard face-palm' of a 12.99$ 'Basic' car wash - ain't doing that again.  I'm sorry I refused your upgrades when it came time for me to hand over my 'whip'.  I'm cheap, but you don't haveta punish a man for being frugal.

I tried - seriously, I tried to come back.  The 35.00$ oil change and car washy was too tempting for me to ignore.    When I arrived at CAS the hipster garage monkey informed me that since I was rocking a newer vehicle and because it drank synthetic oil instead of conventional that there'd be a price difference. Yeah, a 40$ price diff yo.  EEEERRRN - hell no.  It tried but I'z donee mayn.
