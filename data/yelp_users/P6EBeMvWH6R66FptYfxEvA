Amazing cheeseburgers!  The staff is always prompt, the food delicious and the atmosphere is perfect for a date.  My family and I have gone to this restaurant for years and never had a bad meal.  If something was ever wrong with the food they (appeared) happy to fix it.    The only negative is they only have one or two tables that seat more the four comfortably.

My wife, sister-in-law and I were out last night and got into a discussion about "Dive Bars."  My S.I.L. claimed that the Crowne Room was a "dive," I kindly and energetically disagreed.  Then my wife said that our present bar, Hazelwood's, was a "dive"... again, no.  Luckily our heated debate took place across the street from Dilly Dally.  I quickly paid for our drinks, braved the traffic of Indian School and entered the windowless, somehow-still-smokey Lounge.  As all heads turn, I remind my dates to NOT order a Cosmo or a Sex on the Beach!  We went for one drink for demonstration purposes only and found ourselves rapping to our beats on the Jukebox and partaking in some shuffle board till closing.  Whoops.    I do not give this bar 4 stars for service, quality, atmosphere or anything really... except that as far as Dive Bars go, it gets four!

Firstly, I'm a dude.  Secondly, this was my first "salon" experience.  My longtime barber left V's, the quintessential place where MEN get their hair done.  It took me a long time to actually find that barber and it's not worth the growing pains to test out the rest of them.  I told my wife this and she said to try her salon.    With hesitation, I went.  It's overwhelmingly targeted towards women, but once I got over that I got a FANTASTIC haircut.  The stylist was genuine and we chatted almost the whole time... rather than a few dudes mumbling inside jokes to each other the whole time (like at V's).  I would highly recommend Laura McShane!  She took a while "getting to know my hair" and I gave her free reign to do as she pleased.  She gave me a modern haircut that is really low maintenance.  Way better than pointing at a picture of hair I found in GQ.

Crepes... glorious crepes!    I've frequented OPH for many, many years!  The quality, service and the decor (unfortunately) never changes.    Things to know:  They do not accept credit cards They do not take reservations They will only seat you when your entire party is there The wait on the weekends is almost unbearable The French Crepes are freaking amazing! The Apple Pancake is delicious, slow and a modern miracle of baking Dessert for breakfast? Chocolate Chip pancakes!

I try to surprise my wife about once a month with a trip to Barrio.  It's not the closest restaurant to us, but it is always worth the drive.    I've read on past reviews that people say their margaritas are expensive, true, but you get what you pay for!  At least it's not a crappy expensive marg.    Rarely do we venture far from the "Two Fish Tacos and Two Margarita 'Combo'".  We'll mix it up with chips and guac once in a while, but that is just icing on the cake.    The decor is awesome and the place is quaint.  The parking is bad and the wait is long.  Worth it?  Hell yes!    I love it when Italians work at Italian restaurants... and the same goes true for Mexican joints.  Thanks for keepin it real Barrio!

My wife and I love Tee Pee's, it's nothing AMAZING, but it's always good.  Unfortunately, we won't be visiting this establishment anymore.  We had some friends from out of the country and our their last night we wanted to take them to an inexpensive place with authentic Mexican food.    Our waiter came by and we ordered "4 margaritas please!" He replied, "want to get a pitcher of the GOOOD margaritas?!" Unified, we replied, "YES!"  Well, two "GOOOD" pitchers later and we were drunk and ready for the check.  Albeit, the margaritas were really good, but they were not $42 per pitcher good!  Our drink total was $84 and definitely not worth it.  When we asked about the price our waiter said that they offered regular pitchers for $18 or the top shelf (or "GOOOOD") margaritas for $42.  We felt deceived and it put a huge damper on our last night with our friends.

My wife and I went for their happy hour and wi-fi yesterday.  We didn't know that Happy Hour started at 4:00, but we still ordered drinks at 3:40.  At 3:58, our waitress came over and asked if we wanted another round... sure!  We got charged full price!    Apparently I didn't fit in there because I wasn't wearing huge block sunglasses, wore a tight black t-shirt, had my hair spiked high or had Fashion Square Jeans on.  At least now you guys know what to wear.

I frequent this establishment monthly and each time I set my taste buds free down the lager roller coaster they call a Flight.  Their beer selection is amazing and the atmosphere is trendy (but not pretentious).    This is a burger bar and they do burgers right!  If it's your first time, I highly recommend a burger and flight.  If you want to try something new, go for one of the focaccia sandwiches.

Top 4 Cheeseburgers in town!  Great outdoor patio.  Even if seated inside, the architecture flows to their private, twinkle lit patio.  A+ Margaritas.  Great tacos.  The prices are a bit high, but you get what you pay for these days.

Again, people must understand that good things (food) come to those who wait.  Imagine if Matt's Big Breakfast seated as many as a Denny's.  They'd be forced to mass cook, quality would go down and service would suffer.  True, this place COULD be a tad bigger, but you can't discount them for being delicious and popular.  The time my wife and I went, there was only a 20 minute wait, so we strolled around downtown Phoenix, visited the local organic grocer, which I highly recommend, and the time flew by.  We sat at the bar and got the inside scoop on the place as we chatted to everyone from the busboy to the owner.  And the scoop was, they are opening a high-end organic coffee shop on 5th and McDowell or Thomas,

I love their breakfast, their pizza, the shopping, the wine selection, the music... basically everything.    Why not 5 stars?  It's a bit too California.  Scottsdale moms roll up in their Benz with full make-up, diamonds, everything... from the neck up, they look like they're going clubbing.  But then they ALL wear work out clothes like they've just jogged there.  They are going for the LOOK like they just hiked Camelback.  Does this bother anyone else or is it just me?

My wife and I frequent the Vig quite often, however this last trip has inspired me to write my first Yelp! review.  The food.    The music: eclectic, relaxing, and at a volume that allows conversation.  Last night (Tuesday) they had a live DJ scratching accompanied by a live musician who played the guitar and trumpet.  I'd go back JUST for them. The drinks: fairly priced, although we haven't made it for Happy Hour yet.   The bocce ball: among the best in town.  The food: fantastic.  I thought the prices were a bit steep for "bar food," but this is not your average chicken strips and mozzarella balls.  We ordered the most opposite thing on the menu... VigAzz Burger and the Vigan... not quite Vegan.  Both were large portions and full of flavor.  It wasn't your everyday cheeseburger... trust me, my wife is a cheeseburger connoisseur.  Plus, they didn't skimp on the fries.  Why didn't I give the Vig 5 stars?  The Valet parking!  I understand the lot only has 15 spots, but there is an entire shopping center across the street with ample amounts of parking.  On Friday night when we went there, they had the empty parking lot roped off with a parking bouncer who stopped everyone from trying to enter saying they HAD to valet.  Then last night, a Wednesday night, they had Valet again... luckily no parking lot bouncer.

The bar is dark and the ceilings are low.  The beer is strong and the music is loud.  For some reason EVERY time I go here, I have a fantastic night!  The live music ranges from crap to pretty good... but the vibe is always there.  People are dancing, milling around, smoking out back or playing Foosball (at least they used to).  Not everyone loves this bar, but if you can make your own fun... it's a great bar to have a session.

I REALLY wanted to like this place!  Good location, good sports decor, large cheap pitchers, and bar sports (pool, darts, foosball, scuffle board), but alas, I did not.  I have to agree with some (most) of the other Yelpers when I say the service was subpar.  Usually I can handle poor service if the food is decent (I know, I know, it's bar food) but even for bar food, it wasn't very enjoyable.  I mean, HOW on EARTH do you mess up a cheese crisp and chicken tenders?!?      We may go back for a late night foosball game and a health dose of beer, but as far as dinner, drinks and sports.... I sadly say, head across the street to Zipps.

I work walking distance to this shopping center and every day I eat out for lunch.   What to choose, what to choose?  Taco Bell, Arbys, McDonalds, Subway, Chick-fil-a, or Rubios?  This is like a laundry list of what Mesa is based on.    So every day I choose another mediocre place to dine... but once a week I treat myself to Rubio's Cali-Mex Restaurant.  It's just delightful!  It's hard to steer clear from the Beer-Battered Fish Burrito.  If I can make it there on Tuesdays after 2:30, I partake in Taco Tuesday where it's just $1.25.... Those 4 tacos are the best $5 spent in town.  Thanks Rubio's, see you next week!

I will never go back to this establishment because all of the bouncers and wait staff are unfriendly, unprofessional and disrespectful.

This is what neighborhood Phoenix / Scottsdale needs.  An outdoor farmer's market is perfect for this Arcadia area and more like it need to be opened throughout Phoenix metro area.    This small Saturday morning market is a small peek into what Saturdays in France or Italy are like.  People milling around, socializing, eating, drinking.... eating.  We walk there anytime my wife and I have the day off and just enjoy ourselves.  We share tables with strangers, strike up conversations with everyone, read the paper and just enjoy the market with no agenda.    Thank you Vincent.

This place aggravates me!  The location is good, the food is good... and that's about all I can think of that's good about it.  It has such potential though!  Firstly, who wants to be forced to valet when trying to have a quick lunch?    The MAIN complaint is the service!  I sat at the bar to have a drink and an appetizer while I was waiting for my haircut.  I had 45 minutes, so I thought that was plenty of time... it wasn't.  There is one blonde "hot" bartendress who is obviously not hired for her skills.  It took me 10 minutes to get my menu and water and then another 15 of trying my hardest to get her attention to put in my order.  The food came quickly and it was delicious... but this girl spent half of the time talking to two guys at the end of the bar and the other half on her cell texting.  By the end I was standing with cash in my hand to try to get to my haircut on time.    They also short-change you.  My bill was $10.27 and I gave them a $20.  She gave me $9 back... I feel cheated because she kept my $.73 as a tip... she didn't deserve that at all.  PS.  This is not my first time, I've given this place many chances and fortunately there are some places close by finally where I can take my money and tip elsewhere!

The Capri on Camelback has an amazing location!  Walking distance to newly opened Fresh and Easy, Chelsea's Kitchen, Vincent's, Postino, LGO, and the Vig.  It's exactly what you want in walking distance to home.    From the looks of it from the outside, it looks drab and boring, but inside, the apartments are quite nice... nothing to write home about, but nice.    Why the low score?  The Parking is a nightmare!!!!!!!!!  It's the worst possible thing I can imagine!  To go through that headache every single day is become too much.  Every car is parked within inches (INCHES) of each other... and to top it off my truck has been spit on twice.  The staff knows little to nothing.  The laundry is expensive.  And it's like college where every other night a fire alarm gets pulled.  Plus, every single morning from between 7 - 10 am they are dragging metal dumpsters or trimming the hedges or cutting the grass or blowing the grass or etc, etc, etc.  You CANNOT sleep in with the windows open... even weekends.  But the worst thing... in an apartment complex with easily well over 500 people living here, there is NO RECYCLING!  I cannot believe this, in this day in age.  No recycling.  Unacceptable.

I've lived across the street from this location for about a year and not once did I ever enter.  That is to say, up until the last two weeks, where i frequented Fresh and Easy and The Grind four times.    The Grind's location is a great one, but there is much competition for a burger and beer place.  It may not rank amongst the best in town or the cheapest... but its manageable!  The Vig has mandatory valet, Delux always has a wait, Postino's is too crowded and Houston's doesn't seat more than four.  Don't get me wrong, these are among my favorite places in town, but sometimes they are a bit overwhelming.  The Grind offers a low key and low lit atmosphere, which is perfect for unwinding after work, great for a first date (where you can actually talk) and not bad for a sports game.    You won't find me there every night of the week, but it's a great place to just get away from it all.  Lastly, they are open till 2:00 weekends and 12:00 other nights.

Finalmente!    I'm not what you'd call a "great cook" or a "good cook" by any stretch of the imagination.  I make two things very well; cereal and reservations.  Like a superhero swooping out of the UK, F & E has saved the day... and my living situation.  Sure there's a lot of great take-out places nearby (Rubio's, Pei Wei, Chipotle, etc) and there's huge grocery stores down the street.  But none of these offer what F & E does.  Small, manageable, cheap, quick, and sized for one.    If my wife and I don't feel like cooking or going out or ordering delivery, we walk over to Fresh and Easy pick out a few of their single-serving, fresh, delicious, never-frozen, scrumptious pre-packaged dinners.

DO NOT LIVE HERE!  See the pictures of the trash piled up in the garage? That happens on a weekly basis! The stench fills the hot air in the garage. It's do disgusting.   When my wife, daughter and I were moving out over the summer, it was 91 (NINETY ONE) degrees in the apartment because the AC unit was being overworked. My daughter became severely dehydrated and we had to take her to the hospital. It took them 8 days to fix this problem.   The staff is awful. The pool scene is fun, but also gross.   If you already live there, I'm sorry, but you know what I am talking about. If you are doing your research... DO NOT LIVE HERE! I don't know how to make it more clear.

It hurts my heart to give any Chipotle a one star.  Their chicken fajita burritos with pico and extra corn is to die for.   However, on one particular morning, this Chipotle really failed to deliver.  I was hung over and on my way to work and Chipotle got in my head... and once it gets in there, nothing else can deliver.  I ordered my delicious usual, but unfortunately the person creating my burrito didn't spread out any of the ingredients.  While eating I had 6 mouthfuls of just chicken and tortilla, then I had clumps of cold cheese and then an endless amount of veggies with no chicken or cheese in sight... disgusting.  It literally ruined my day.  Instead of getting an instant cure to my hangover, it took it to another level because I was overly annoyed and just unsatisfied.    I will return to my beloved Chipotle, but I'll be sure to keep a close eye on the creator.
