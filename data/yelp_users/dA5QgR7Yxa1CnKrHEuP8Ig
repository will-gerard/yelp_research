O.K. so I went to my first Overeaters Anonymous meeting on Monday....  no joke. So before I do that deal I'm saying goodbye to my favorite Phoenix delicacies.   This Place --ohhh.   It's sex. It's total sex.   Sometimes sex is nice. It's fun, it doesn't hurt, it's familiar.   Not here.   It's like the shy unassuming person you never really thought of doin' it with before.  It's been in the neighborhood forever, you never really hear about how awesome it is, it doesn't look like much from the inside or outside. It kind of looks like an old school adobe Taco Bell.   So, never really having had a good Philly Cheesesteak sandwhich, I wasn't sure what to expect.   The Menu is pretty simple. 8 different cheesesteaks, gyros, subs, fries, onion rings, tasty cakes, salads, burgers.   Well duh, I'll get a cheesesteak.   The cheesesteaks are 10 inches.   Even after I saw that, I was thinking,"I can take this". I ordered a half mushroom one, a half pizza one. Thinking I could take 5 inches at a time, and save some for later.   So I began taking it.   This shy unassuming restaurant began showing how truly Freaky DeeKay it was.   The first bite was mind blowing, amazing, opening up whole new vistas of experience. I never knew it could be this good. The steak is chopped on the grill with olive oil, and then covered in white american cheese. The mushroom added the best mushrooms I have ever had on a sandwhich. The pizza side added really well done pizza sauce.   That first bite ohhh.   Then thats where it got nasty, and rough.  It's too much! I thought I was tough, I thought I could take it- but this is fried red meat covered in fatty cheese encased in delicious carb centric white italian bread.  That first bite was amazing, but I wasn't sure this was for me. I was worried about the damage to my body. I didn't know if my heart could take it.  The sandwhich looked at me as if to say "want me to stop?". I considered that this was rough, this was new- but my 10 inch big boy was such a demonstration of mastery and experience, I couldn't stop. I NEEDED more.  So as I was abandoning myself to the experience I realized this was just on the brink of gross enough to be nasty and carnal, and refined enough to be a truly unique experience. There was no fatty pieces in the meat. It wasn't too hard and tough. It's astuteness tempered itself by being soft and delicate.  There were moments where I thought 'Oh my god, I have to stop, I think I might die!" but I couldn't. I so couldn't.  This in not something I can handle every day. This sandwhich made me want to eat salads for the rest of the week. Not because I feel dirty or guilty, simply because I know taking this thing pushed the physical limits of my body.   Too many of these and I could easily see myself crying in  shame and lamenting  "what man would want me now"?

My Logic tells me I should not like this pizza.   I'm typically a New York slice snob.. and sometimes, I sacrilegiously enjoy a Chicago deep dish. And who could not worship an artisean Pizzeria Bianco? I've had really good pizza in Italy too....   This pizza is nothing like those.  It's heavy on the bread, it's got a chunky tomato sauce.. The cheese is definately American- more Midwestern without any attempt to make it taste Italian.  My DNA is more than half Italian, and my tastebuds should be offended at this bastardization. But.........  It's good. Really good. It is NOT New York pizza. Maybe I'm forgetting how truly good a new york slice is, but I really liked it.   This pizza makes me wonder... If I were to move to New York.. and there were no good Sonoran Mexican restaurants.... After 3 years, would I think Taco Bell was divine?  (Their ingredients are better than Taco Bell, and it's obvious someone cares about how the product tastes. If the owner reads this- thumbs up.)

I sometimes convince myself that there are better Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, then I come here and the illusion is definately shattered.   Except for the original Garcia's Las Avenidas's rice- Carolina's has the best of everything they do.   I thought for a moment that the restauraunt Rito's had better tortillas, but then I bought a dozen. No way. My mom makes really good tortillas, but they are tied with Carolina's.  I've had the following: Machaca- Melt in your mouth soft- perfect flavor, quality beef Beans- Perfect Rice - Very Good Green Corn Tamale- My mouth just seriously watered thinking about it Chicken Taco- Oh My Beef Taco - Oh Oh My Chorizo Con Huevos- Dang- Good Cheese Tortilla - Dios Mio! Tortillas- Every meal on earth should be eaten with Carolina's tortillas- no more forks, no more knives, just tortillas.  One thing- The Oaxaca burrito isn't good. It's the one thing I've even had from here that didn't knock me out.

I know that hundreds of you wait everyday for a new review by me, checking yelp several times a day in hopes that I've been generous enough to share my whit and culinary expertise.   For all of you, my fans, I have some news that may rock your world.   I went vegan 5 months ago.   Margaret Cho does a stand up skit about people you should not F*** with. On the list are gay men, lesbians, vegans, and Bjork.   "Do not f*** with vegans... Do not look vegans in the eye.. If you get in an argument with a vegan, say you're sorry and back away slowly. You don't mess with vegans because they're F******* hungry!"  This is true.   I was hungry for 6 weeks until I realized the only two foods that satisfied my hunger are refried beans and hummus.   So.. why two stars for a restaurant that caters to vegans?  The prices.   I am not a cheapskate. I spend a ridiculous amount of money on food. I once spent $500 on a meal for three people - and didn't feel ripped off, because it was worth it.  I ordered a vegetarian plate. Humus tabouli, falafel & dolmeh served over white & brown rice. Falafel is topped with tahini. Humus & tabouli served with fresh veggies & homemade nan.   So... most places... a meal like this would be 8 dollars. Maybe 14 at a good restaurant. $20 for this... I expect the best on earth and a huge portion.  It wasn't.   The hummus was pure tahini - awful really. The baba was smoky and kind of gross The falafel I didn't think was that great. The dolmeh were good.   The portion size was a normal Styrofoam take away box with one piece of pita.  I will say that the rice was divine. Saffron - y and perfectly cooked.   The price was not equivalent to the quantity or quality.   I was mad. Baiz market sells a whole Styrofoam box full of exponentially better hummus for 5.99.  Vegans are a hard bunch to please, I realize, but charging this much for less than  perfect food will not win my business.

What? Only a 4 star average for this place? And only 27 reviews? Come on Phoenix!  I admit, If all I care about is the food, I'm heading to Carolina's.  However- you can't really relax at Carolina's. No one waits on you, no matter how transcendant the food is you're always hearing someone yell "Number 27!" "Number 28!". God help you if it's summer.  Garcia's, although still in the ghetto, is somewhere you can go, relax, be waited on, enjoy free chips and salsa before the meal, and enjoy a pleasant conversation friendly environment.   As for the food- I've never had a bad meal here. The rice is the best in the city. It's really moist without being wet, there are chunks of real tomatoes in it. They have dishes that you can't get just everywhere like fish dishes and my favorite, chili con carne- very similar to how my mom makes it, but they have a green version as well as a red version.    I've taken my boss from out of town here, dates... (well, escorts.. same thing...), and friends here (again... escorts, but...  )  and everyone of them were like in a happy daze afterwards. Blissed out like heroin junkies..   I think two of them were on heroin.. but still it's really really good food.   I love you Garcias Las Avenidas! Only 2 more months till my 1 year ban is lifted!  (you all know I kid.. right?)

Yeah, it's got it's issues.   I think anyone that knows me knows I'm a food addict. I will do some pretty embarrassing things for a good meal. Case in point....   The first time I attempted to try Wahsun was a Thursday. I went at 4 pm and it was closed. I forgot the exact hours listed on the sign in the window, but it definitely indicated they should have been open. Something akin to 11 am to 9 pm. So.. I did what any good food addict would do. I waited it out. I went to Bookman's and read books for an hour, thinking they must open by 5. Checking back, still closed, I went to Starbucks and read a book in the cold for an hour.. Checking back at 6, still closed.   I was mad.   Reading a New Times best of Phoenix review made me really want to try it tho.   I decided to call the next day. They answered, and I ordered what the New Times review suggested - crab in onion ginger sauce and some egg rolls. I drove the six miles and got it, then brought it home.    OMG Becky.   The egg rolls are mammoth. almost as big as a coke can. They are full of shrimp, pork, and chicken. There is a bit of ginger flavor inside as well. They weren't like anything I've ever tasted before. Intense and beyond delicious.   Then the crab. OMG. The coating of ginger and onion sauce was indescribably good.  It activated some neanderthal like eating gene in me, I ate that crab for a good 30 minutes getting every morsel out of it. The sauce was salty and sweet, perfectly seasoned. It was truly amazing. I was so satiated.   The next night I brought friends. The place is sparse as others have mentioned, but the tables do have a lazy susan, which we all took advantage of. We got the duck, crab (again), pot stickers, egg rolls, and walnut shrimp.   I don't usually like pot stickers, but dang these were good. The duck is good - however it is gamy. I have ordered it for take out and it was too gamy for me to eat.  The walnut shrimp is the best I've had in Phoenix, but didn't compare to the other entrees.   On a subsequent visit (I think it was the day after) I also ordered sweet and sour pork, and it is divine. probably the best meal you can get in Phoenix for under $5.   I really appreciate Wahsun being in the valley, which is why I'm giving them five stars. They do have issues with random opening time, and the duck being gamy, however I'm giving them 5 stars because that crab was the best I've ever had - and we're in a desert people.

The egg rolls have got to be the best in Phoenix, they set a new standard for me. Today I ordered food - Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Sweet and Sour Pork, Crab Puffs, and Egg Rolls. The whole time I'm driving to pick up the food I'm thinking "I should have ordered Pot Stickers too..."  When I get there, the lady is busy, I'm on my cell phone she's on the phone, we smile at each other, I hand her $25 bucks (the bill was $23) she smiles warmly, I leave. I don't think we even said anything. A perfect transaction.   I open the box on top while driving home, it was labeled "Free THX!". Inside there were like 10 of their amazing pot stickers. These people not only know my soul, they cook for it!  Whoever complained that there was chicken in their Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, yes, there was... but the shrimp were the best quality and cooked better than any shrimp I've had for less than say $15. They tasted fresh and perfectly cooked. - And this was $8.   As I've said, the Sweet and Sour Pork is the best meal in Phoenix for under $5  Crab Puffs needed more filling, but there was a ton - like 15, and they were quite good.   This and Asian Cafe Express in Mesa are definitely the two best Chinese restaurants in Phoenix.   For Egg Rolls? Wah Sun - No comparison. For Crab? Even though I brought in a live crab and had Asian Cafe Express cook it for me, the Crab in Ginger and Onion Sauce at Wah Sun was exponentially better.  I'm all about the food. The service is like home here. I prefer it over the service say at PF Changs. Treat the lady like you would your Mom. To be honest tho, they could serve food this good with a catapult aimed at my open mouth, flinging food into my face and pointing and laughing at me while doing it and I'd still give them 5 stars. The food is that good.

Dang. Duh -HAng   This is goo foo!   My mom is deathly allergic to shellfish. That, and I grew up in a desert for 10 of my formative years. When I think of shellfish, I think of slightly forbidden, delicious little delicacies. While growing up the idea of lobster and crab was the ultimate indulgence in haught cuisine, it seemed.  .  The only time my Mom liked fish is when it didn't taste like fish. "I like swordfish because it's not fishy", or "ooh orange roughy is so good! It's not fishy at all".   I wanted fishy fish. I wanted something that tasted like the ocean. I wanted to see why lobster and crab was so expensive.   In more selfish and morbid moments I hoped a chef would accidentally drop a shrimp into her food so she would die, and I could eat all the seafood I wanted.   There's no lobster at Oscar's Pier 83, but you can get things here that are really rare in Arizona, and plenty of it is exquisitely fishy, in the freshest way imaginable.   I did takeout and I ordered a lot of food:  Oscar's Ultimate Combo (1 Jumbo Shrimp, 1 Jumbo Sea Scallop, 1 Oyster, 1 House Fish, 1 Chicken Strip, 1/4 pound Fried Clam Strips, Fries, Cole Slaw)  THEN  Fried Soft-shell Crab  Crab cake  Clam Chowder   It was all at least 4 stars.   The Exquisite:  The Fried Oyster- My god this was good. Keep in mind I told you I like fishy fish, but this thing was fresh, juicy, full of meat, and perfectly matched my seafood craving. I thought it was a scallop at first, which is one of my favorite things on earth- but it was so much better than any scallop I've ever had.  The Fried Soft Shell Crab- This was served with a pink remoulade like sauce that was divine. This thing was meaty, a little salted, and perfectly flavored. The remoulade was excellent.  The Crab cake- It had a ton of crab in it. The only one I've had that was better was in Maryland overlooking the water. Dipped in the remoulade this more than just good.  The Clam Chowder- It spilled in the car, in the bag, so I brought it in and ate the chowder with a spoon out of the bag. It was that good.   The Very Good-  The House Fish- Really good. Probably the best I've had. What's weird is that I think the excellence of the oyster and soft shell crab overshadowed this. Had I had this on it's own I'd probably be raving about it. It wasn't fishy at all.  The Scallop- It was a little dry and bland. Very big however.  The Shrimp- Better than a lot of shrimp I've had in Arizona- but not the best I've ever had.  The Chicken Strip- Had I been more present at the time of ordering I would have tried to substitute this for something else.   When I go again, I will order the soft shell crab, 3 oysters, and some clam chowder.   Maybe I'll bring in my mom and Oscar will be the one to finally do her in with a stray piece of shrimp (DEVIL LAUGH). I kid, I kid.

So I went today, Wednesday at 1:30 or so. I was expecting a small run down place with like 6 people in it.   The sign for Lin's is large, and the building is as well. It's not your average ghetto Chinese buffett. It's big.  There were about 100 people there. (I didn't look at the pictures before I went.)  I was very curious...   So..   Three long buffet counters that have hot food, one that has cold, a sushi bar, and a mongolian barbeque.   Impressive...   So why one star?  The food was barely edible. This is definately an example of America's love affair with quantity over quality.   The good-  Large Selection Egg Roll- edible- barely Bread roll- normal american- good Chinese Spare Ribs- decent Cool entry way and building Service was attentive  The Bad: Sweet and Sour Chicken Seasame Chicken Spring Rolls (how can they mess this up??? - I couldn't eat them! I've had frozen ones that were bettter.) Shrimp and Chicken dish Rice Noodles Fish Lo Mein  I don't trust sushi at $8 buffets, and I don't like Mongolian, so these may be the two items everyone raves about, but what I had was flat out gross.  So I'm pretty hungry.. and I start trying a little of eveything. All of it was gross. But I'm like- this got a lot of 5 star ratings on Yelp, maybe the next thing will be good. No, that was nasty too, maybe the next?   So I way over ate trying to find the food y'all were saying is worth 4 or 5 stars.  If I was six years old, I would be so happy that I could get chicken nuggets, and pizza, and onion rings, and french fries, and egg rolls, and pudding, and ice cream. But I'm not 6- and this food was gross.   For buffet I'd much rather go to China Garden on 19th and Bell. That has 1 row of hot food, but it's delicious. I'd even rather go to Mike Kwans Golden Coin - and that has a 1 star yelp rating.   Did I mention that the food was gross?
