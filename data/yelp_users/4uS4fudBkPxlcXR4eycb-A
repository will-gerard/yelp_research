For anyone who gives this place five stars-I seriously question your taste buds.  This is the Hometown Buffet of mexican food and it left both my friend and I feeling extremely ill.  If you want to spend a lot of money for canned food, then Valle Luna is perfect for you.

This place-AMAZING.  I ordered the green chile burro with chicken and my friend ordered the bean and cheese burrito.  Both were bomb.  Looks like I'm going to be in Chandler a lot more often now!

Loves it.  For only a small amount of $$ I leave the place with take-out feeling like I just went grocery shopping.  The portions are crazy big.  The ingredients are fresh.  The taste is spot on when I'm craving vietnamese food.

Heck. Yes.  This place is amazing.  Basic, flavorful, and cheap.  I am guilty for not eating here after passing this place for years because it looks like a sketch fest.  Shame on me.  Don't make the same mistake!

Is the owner over it or something?  This place used to be awesome.  Every once and a while, my friends and I will come in to see if it's shaping up to what it used to be.  Nope.  I have a feeling his employees will be forced to start job hunting soon.  To all of you looking for an upbeat experience with good italian food, the Parlor OR Cibo in Phoenix is where it's at.  Sorry, Boa.  It's not me-it's you.

It's a must.  This is a perfect example of why you should never judge a restaurant by its neck of the woods.

Please don't use Jamie C's review as a deciding factor as she has also rated Jack in the Box with 4 stars.  No wonder you had to add salt to your burger.  And gross.  Anyway, I've only had great experiences here especially when I get off of work starving and this place is the only restaurant in the area smart enough to stay open late.  Service has always been friendly...then again, I know how to be respectful and not wave my hands in the air like a total douche.  See you guys soon!

Ghetto much?  If you like to wear a ton of hair gel and buy your dresses 5 sizes too small at Charlotte Russe then SWEEEEEEET this place is perfect for you.  The ONLY good thing is the music...the crowd just ruins it though.

Good food, casual, and friendly.  We had the stuffed burgers with coleslaw and sweet potato fries.  The coleslaw is BOMB...kinda wish I was eating some right now.

Eh.  And, trust me, I wish I felt more for this place as I was really excited to try it.  Go to Cartel, man.

Before I begin my review, please scroll down to read the review written by Debra S.  PLEASE tell me she was 5 glasses deep while writing that review and MAYBE I'll understand a little bit more.  Anyway, trashy and completely stupid to say the least.  My boyfriend and I went to experience iPic this evening and it was the BEST date we had been on in I don't remember how long.  The level of hospitality went beyond my expectations; our server was so kind, articulate, and professional.  Also, I NEVER thought I'd be raving about movie theatre food-it was always something I kind of made fun of.  So, if you plan on going, save the extra money to have that much better of an experience.  It's worth it.    The only problem is I consider every other movie theatre to be a complete dump now, and I can't afford that mentality (yet)!

FINALLY.  It's about time something worthy of this location took over.  This place is perfect if I feel like being a jerk to my waistline or light and healthy.  Service is smart and efficient which is awesome since NO ONE likes lines.  I just wish they stayed open later :/

So I didn't try the beer BUT the bloody mary's are amazing.  A-ma-zing.  I also ordered the pork arepa.  Super flavorful and the perfect amount if you're beyond starving, which I was.  My friend ordered the green chili pulled pork sandwich which was equally as good.  I will definitely be back.  If anyone has had a bad experience here, it must've been a fluke...
