I have tried many different Thai places in the East Valley and this has been my tride and true. I am consistently pleased with the food and the staff! The atmosphere is nice and makes dining there a joy. I encourage anyone to try the Thai Custard dessert. Its my favorite!

Overall, the food was quite good. A little slow, but pretty yummy. The service definitely left something to want for. Our server appeared as though she did not care. When we said we'd never been in before, she asked if we were tourists. Nope. Not tourists. She was very distant and absent the whole meal. Ordered my meal without avocado and it came with avocado. When I pointed this out, she seemed upset with me. Ordered my coffee with cream only, brought me sugar. It was the little things and the neglect but we will definitely think twice before returning for dinner again.

Food is good. Huge portions. Been here a couple of times. Quiet place during the week. Except that someone who owns or works here had their kids come in. They sat them directly next to us and were as loud as could be. No consideration for their paying guests. It would be nice to be treated as a patron and not an inconvenience. Was very close to asking for a different table. Literally no boundaries or supervision.

Waiter was very nice - hence the 2 stars. The menu does not list all the main ingredients of your dish so beware. The music is so incredibly loud that you cannot carry a conversation without shouting. The food was only so so. The beer selection, while large, is disappointing. We would not go back.

If I could leave a 0 star review, I would. Ladies. Beware.   My husband and I went in to pick out shirts for work. The associate who assisted us could not have been more disrespectful. He ignored me the entire time, only speaking to my husband. Whenever I said anything, he looked so disgusted. Referred to me as "little lady" or "young girl".   When we needed a size that wasn't in stock, he suggested a few things. 1) Have the "little lady at home" move the button the the neck and 2) just not button it and tie the tie without the button being buttoned. It's a $60 shirt. When we declined his suggestions, he begrudgingly ordered it.   When he learned that we were married he said to my husband "see? You do have someone at home to sew that for you." I informed him that I do not sew, and my husband is perfectly capable of learning to do so himself.   When we went to leave, he shook my husbands hand and said "thank you sir" and looked at me and nodded, "little lady". We will not be returning to this store as long as this gentleman works there.
