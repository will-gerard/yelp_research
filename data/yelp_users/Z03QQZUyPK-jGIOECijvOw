I've been waiting 3 years to write this. Best bar ever in old town. Family vibe all around in this joint. Jonesy is the best bartender hands down. He always knew right when I walked in to hit me with a cold Bud heavy and a shot of fireball. Plus he listened to all our work drama and even had specials for us. Nice little patio for smoking and the good is great too. Patty melt, Chicago dog, quesadilla I could go on forever and I would, but let's be real I don't have that kind of time.  Great selection of beer, wine and hard alcohol. Nice porch to toke down a few cigs and classic arcade games to enjoy whole sipping on a cocktail or two with your friends.  Needless to say, DJs is one of Scottsdale's best establishments.

The star rating is not what I want to give David's because I typically enjoy their food. However the only way I have found to eat David's is in the physical restaurant itself.   I've ordered delivery from here a few times and it's never good. I just got cheese fries and a burger and I can't even eat the burger because the bun is so soggy and same kent the fries. Both are soggy, cold and not edible.   I felt bad for the delivery guy so I still threw him a bad tip even though it took over a hour to get here when they told us 35 minutes.  Pretty bummed about David's right now

I'm gunna throw out a 5 star for these guys. Their delivery is in point. They make it every time in under 30 minutes and the good is still smokin hot. Into it.  I generally stick with the same thing. Potstickers, orange chicken, crab Rangoon and chicken friend rice. All solid choices and never let you down.

Great lawyers.  They have been helping me with a case for a little bit if time now. Holly, Lesley and Craig are a wonderful team.  I would and have recommended them to friends.
