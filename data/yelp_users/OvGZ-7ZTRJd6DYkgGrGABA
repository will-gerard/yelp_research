Chris is THE MAN!  i went there to look for a pair of trail running shoes, the Vasque Velocity.  I have not been able to find this shoe anywhere in phoenix, the 5th largest city in the uS.  seriously?  but Chris hooked me up!  he is INCREDIBLY knowledgable about footwear, what each shoe does and when i explained to him what my wants/needs were and showed him how i was standing, he explained to me why X shoe would be better for than Y shoe as well as helped me understand for the first time why i need an orthotic insert.  my feet are feeling GREAT!  i am so happy with them, whenever i need something, i will go there first and YOU SHOULD TOO!

Typical, usually tasty, Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers food.  BUT!  The last 7 times I have come to this particular restaurant, they have managed to screw up my order in some manner; drive-through or walk-in. Just make sure that you have a bit of extra time to make sure that your food is as you ordered it.  Also, if you go inside to make sure your food is correct as you ordered it, especially if you want to change anything, make sure you have some time.  I have, in these last 7 instances, not made it out of here in less than 7 minutes AFTER my food was ordered.  And Oh my goodness if there is a long line. Just turn around and find another place.

I'm here weekly. Omnomnomnomnom!  Ahhhh. SO good. Go on the weekend to get oatmeal raisin or, hopefully, VOLCANO! cookie.  Get extra #10 sauce when ordering the Emerald Chicken.

5 Stars for Jose and his exceptional customer service skills. 3 stars for BB.  I was not a regular shopper at BB.  I went there b/c I could never get help at Fry's, or when I did get help, the people I spoke with, concerning phones/ bluetooth/ etc, were not really knowledgable.  I went to this BB and had a much better experience in the customer service area of my trip. They, unfortunately, have a small selection of bluetooth stereo headphones that are flexible, such as the LG Tone Pro, but apparently everyone else suffers the same issue of lack of selection.  My LG Tone were great for a while, then "known issues" started popping up, and frequently enough to warrant a return on my part.  I upgraded to the LG Tone Pro and again, the same issues, but more frequently.  I traded straight across for another Pro model believing that perhaps I simply bought a lemon.  NOPE!  Once again, the same issues that make this product basically worthless as a bluetooth headset.    I went back in and wanted to get the brand new LG Tone Ultra, seeing reviews that these known issues had almost completely been taken care of (2 weeks later, more reviews say they haven't.)  They did not have them in stock, nor were they available on the BB website.  There was not a single item available nationwide at this time.    When the CS clerk told me that I could only get a store credit for the $70 I spent on what was a horrible product, I had to take some time to breathe and count.  I gave you my hard-earned money and you won't give it back?  Then, fortunately for all involved, Jose, an ASM or SM, popped in and listened to what I wanted.  I said, "I just want something that works, and you don't have it."  He took the time, (about 30 minutes total) to find the product that they had in stock that would work for me.    Jose ended up deeply discounting their most expensive BT headset to get me out with something that actually works!  I paid no extra toward the far superior brand/model that I have on my neck now, the Bluebuds X.    I am Very grateful to Jose for bending over backwards to get me into a product that works for me 100%.  He did this because he had no choice in the matter to give me my money back, it was literally out of his hands and corporate policy removed that option from him completely.  I am happy with my experience in store, not so much with the corporate policies that refused to return my money to me.

My move with Smooth Moves was the best experience I have ever had!  Brandon and his crew are great professionals who handled my load and unload extremely well.  They handled each item as if it were their own making sure not to damage any of the furniture or my house's walls or doorways.  They had some pretty cool straps and tools they used to lift heavy items with ease.  They were also very cognizant of and with MY time and moved efficiently and quickly.  I never thought that moving could be so precise, yet their knowledge of what it took to move my items in the way that they did showed that they really did know what they were doing and had all the tricks and techniques down.  I can not recommend highly enough that you use Smooth Moves for your next move.
