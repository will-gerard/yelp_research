Best time to go is lunch time so you can pack your bowl so full of deliciousness!!! I usually pack enough for 2 cartons so I can eat lunch, dinner AND lunch the next day. They are always have fresh tasting food and they workers are so nice and they love to help you with anything you need.

I gave birth to both of my sons here and it was amazing. The rooms are big and they are very accommodating. I had no problems with the staff and their nurses treated my sons wonderfully. Thank you!

Nice very location. Clean and the employees are very nice. The whole downside is when you have a slightly difficult order you have to wait until they put it in the computer before you can continue with the rest of order. Takes longer than just a little longer than normal

I LOVE THIS PLACE I LOVE THIS PLACE I LOVE THIS PLACE!! If I could live here I would! This is my favorite place in the entire world. I can buy books brand new and know that with every purchase I buy I'm helping our local small businesses. I can trade almost any book in for trade credit and then BUY MORE BOOKS!! I have met some of my favorite authors here. There is always something going on and it's always a fun time. My kids love story time and always love playing with the train set. They get excited whenever I say we are going to changing hands. This place is so family friendly and everyone who works there is so nice.

My first time here... was a very interesting experience. My chef was awesome. But the food was bland and the restaurant was dirty. I pulled out my chair and there was a mushroom stuck to it. And my friend pulled out her chair and there was a dirty napkin on it. They stuff as many people as that can in one table. Dirty, dirty place.

These cupcakes are super over priced. And to me does not take like they should taste due to pricing. I am very disappointed. My cupcake was very dry.

This place does not understand customer service. I ordered my sub for delivery at 1 pm and it said that it would be arriving by 145. 210 rolls around and I called about the status of my order. *keep in mind I work around 10 min away* and he said that it was on the road and will take 15-25 min. Um WHAT. So I told him that that is ridiculous and that it was promised that it would be here almost 30 min ago. And he said Okay do I want to cancel my order. Smh. So I cancelled my order and told them that they wont be charging me and they agreed.   I work in an office of more than 20 people and we will not be ordering for them ever again.

This place has the BEST customer service I have ever received. The sales lady was so nice and got us everything we needed. We had a vague idea of what we needed and she helped more than I thought I would get help with. She even gift warped and took all the tags off as well! I wish I liked tea so I could have a reason to keep coming back!

This place is absolutely delicious. I had my friends bring me back some for lunch one day and I fell in love. So I dragged my husband to it a couple months later. The live music was awesome. The food was great. And even tho we were 15 minutes late to our reservation, they still sat us pretty quickly! Love this place!!

This was my first time here. Yes, the wait is a little long but it was totally worth it. The food was amazing and so filling, I almost didn't eat all of it. I can't wait until I can come back.

I went in and was greeted by several employees immediately. 9ne of them even offered my husband and I a drink of water or soda. They were very nice but they didnt carry my favorite brand, Toshiba. It wasn't as packed as it was during the holiday season which was nice. Customer service her was a lot better than the Apple store

It was okay. I wish they let you know on the menu that mushrooms are included in the vegetables. And when you get the plate, for the amount of food they give you should come with more than 2 tortillas.

So I went back to give them another try and I got something super simple like a chicken quesadilla. I really had hoped that it would be just chicken and cheese but NOPE. Again with them not disclosing everything on the dish. No where on the menu did it say that it would be topped with their garlic beet crema or whatever it was. I am very picky eater and the waitress was super rude when I told her I didn't want my quesadilla topped with whatever it was topped with. She kept pressuring me to try it and i DID not appreciate it. I just wanted her to please get me a new plate. She definitely gave me attitude. I will not be returning. That its twice that you have not disclosed everything in your dishes. You guys are very lucky I wasn't allergic to anything.

I went to top golf last night for the first time. And it was really fun. Everyone there was super nice. I just didn't understand why they had so many employees just walking/standing around doing nothing. When we got to the bay, our sever was... Okay. She left all the dirty dishes on the table and didn't clear anything off. I had to get up and push all the dirty dishes to one side of the table because she didn't remove anything. It was obvious that our waters were empty and she didn't refill them or ask if we wanted anymore.   Overall I had fun, our server just wasn't the best. I will probably be back but I heard the service at the Scottsdale location was a lot better. I will go there next time.

The best part about this place is the fact that you can pick and choose what you want on your personal pizza right in front of your face. The pesto chicken pizza is the best thing I've ever tasted. It's perfect because I can have half from lunch and have the other half for dinner. I was super nervous the first time I ordered there because I'm not a fan of thin crust pizza. But this changed my opinion.   The reason it is getting 4 stars is because the people that work there aren't the best. It's like a hit or miss. Sometimes they are super nice and other times they barley acknowledge you with grunts.   Overall, this pizza is delish.
