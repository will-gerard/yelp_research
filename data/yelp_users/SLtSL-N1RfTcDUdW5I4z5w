I think don helped me today in photo. Couldn't possibly be more annoyed. No hello. Had to stand there for 10 minutes just to have him huff and puff over nothing. Terrible customer service, I won't be back.

I LOVE this pizza!  It's the best I have had in Phoenix.  Not the greatest atmosphere to sit down in.  Service is fine... but the pizza is awesome.

SOOOO Delicious.  I would have to say this is my new favorite restaurant. I'm so mad it took me this long to check it out. Lemonade is perfect on a hot day. The collard greens are AMAZING. You must try the collard greens.  One of the best meals I have had in a long time.

I agree, Karen is awesome. This Ulta closed down and she is at Arrowhead now. i tried the Tempe Maketplace Ulta (writing review next) and I now know I must travel to Arrowhead to see Karen. Well worth it:)

Waited just under 15 minutes adn walked out.  Not very busy.  No one said hello or greeted us in any way.  Go somewhere else- not worth it! Set up is weird. If it was busy, you could certainly never play pool.  You would be hitting everyone.

My new favorite italian spot!!  Loved it.  Talked about it for days.  We ordered a ton of food-- Calamari was awesome, spinach ravioli and caesar salad were perfect.  My husband had two beers, a ceasar and an entree as well.  Our bill was only $60-- totally worth it. Service was awesome, they made us feel like family.

Disgusting food. Good service.  I have tried Z'Tejas twice and will never try it again.

Most over-rated restaurant ever. I have gone their twice- both times the service was AWFUL and food inedible. We called a day ahead and told them a party of 14 were coming. They told us they usually don't take reservations but they would set something up for us and they are very slow around lunch so no problem. We arrived and the hostess was rude and had no idea we were coming. There wasn't anyone there so they set up a table for us. We asked if we could have our checks split and the rude waitress said absolutely not. I have worked in restaurants for many years and if someone is paying for a service and asks ahead of time for split checks I think it is awful to say no way. We will never return there as a group and we do group lunches often at my job. We waited an HOUR (63 minutes to be exact) for our food to hit the table after we ordered. The waitress was terrible- I never got a refill and arte my lunch thirsty. She added 18% grat to our check and made us figure out how to split it. The first time I went there I said I would NEVER return and I gave them one more shot because people claim its amazing and now I am sure I will never go back.

I'm soooo glad to hear other people are surprised by the rave. PF Changs is AWFUL. Over-priced and truly disgusting. I have had one horrible experience after another. I will never return. So many other options that are less expensive and more appetizing.

Good but I am sure the staff is high. Or retarded. Also, they do not use enough meat.

Hostess staff were a few unorganized morons-- it appeared as if it was literally their first night on the job. Maybe too many of them? The service was fast but I wouldn't say friendly. She made a few mistakes with our order-- gave my daughter a cheese pizza when we ordered pepperoni..  She put a glass right in front of my 22 mo old who grabbed it right away of course-- few other rookie mistakes like that. Calamari- gross. Lobster/crab tacos with white bland rice-- don't order it. My husband was happy with ribeye and atmosphere is cool and clean.

This place is amazing!  The best carne asada I have ever had!  I like the limited menu- they are good at carne asada and salsa and they should stick to it.  Keep it simple.  Restaurants over complicate things and everything suffers because of it.  Beer will be an awesome addition.  My burrito came out really quickly and the guy running food and bussing tables (Gavin?) was really sweet and helpful.  A little expensive but worth it-- I will be back for sure!

Soo where do I begin?  I started going to Ulta at Metro Center a few years ago. I hated everything about the place other then the hair dressers. It was dirty... actually, filthy. The girls that worked up front were clueless. I never once saw a manger on the floor. The fact that they didn't have a receptionist in the salon drove me nuts. I was always interrupted several times during my service. On the other hand, I have never had so many compliments about my hair- plus Metro Center is super close. I dealt with my frustrations because I love Karen, her hair cuts are reasonable ($35), they could always fit me in last minute, and the location was super convenient. Well, I wasn't too surprised when I found out they were closing. My friends told me I had to follow Karen though matter what- that she gave me the best haircuts I have ever had. I don't want to travel to Arrowhead and Tempe Marketplace is right next to my job so I decided to try them on a lunch break. I call in and book an eyebrow wax and haircut. Wax- 12:45 and cut at 1PM they tell me. I get there a few minutes early and get my eyebrows waxed in the middle of the store at the "brow bar". I hated this experience. If I am paying $20 for a wax, I want to be in a dark room, candles, music... I need more peace in my life. Instead, I am sitting in the middle of a busy store, of course being interrupted every 2 seconds. The girl is helping customers decide which foundation to buy, walking them to the isle and pointing to the eyeliner they are looking for... Are you kidding me?  So 20 minutes into this embarrassing scene of a waxing she tells me I should just go and get my hair done and come back afterwards to finish my waxing.  I hated my haircut. I told the girl several times what I wanted and she promised me when it was dry it would look that way. No, it didn't and I am on my lunch break. My bangs looked like a kid cut them. I go back to the "brow bar" and she has 6 people standing around her and she is doing someone's brows. She apologizes and says it will be a few more minutes. I buy some makeup, wait on a long line, pay and she is still working on the same girl. I told her again, I am on my lunch break, I have to go. She says bye. I call and complain for the first time in my life. I had to- I was so upset. The manager tells me to come in for free wax and cut. I was pleased with this offer- went in and still am not that happy. So long story short- I miss Karen and I will certainly make the trip to Arrowhead for now on.

Place is tiny and awkwardly set up. You have to reach over someones head to get a lid and straw for your drink... Went there twice and they got my really simple (turkey, lettuce, and mustard on wheat) order wrong both times. The last time they smothered it in mayo! If you want an amazing sandwich skip this place and go to sprouts deli... 2.99 and delicious.

Food was good. Place is adorable. Worst service I have ever received in my life. Almost 3 hours to get food. Server was not polite. Appetizers never arrived. Some Drinks took over an hour. Server told us the kitchen is "slammed" but most tables were empty. Only one valet guy and  a wedding walks out at the same time as us. We waited so long we took our own keys and walked to our cars.

Overpriced garbage. I would have actually bought something if the guy working there wasn't so rude. Terrible customer service. Do not waste your time!

SO surprised with all the positive reviews. I have been here twice and the first time I sat and waited 45 min and had my 4 year old with me. I would have never waited if they told me it would be that long. The second time they rushed and were so unprofessional. I left paying $50 for a mani and pedi and bleeding on my hands and feet from them cutting my cuticles carelessly. I will never go back. It is small and smells really strong of chemicals and could def use a makeover as far as the interior goes. I rather travel to 16TH st and Morten where I have the best customer service for cheaper and a better job overall.

Long line, slow service. Coffee was cold - not fresh. Like many other reviewers... I am  from NY, the bagel was just okay. I won't be back.

45 minute wait for overpriced mediocre eggs and raw, soggy, french toast and it wasn't even busy. The people who were there all wore Lulu Lemon yoga pants and clearly didn't go to yoga by the looks of their hair and makeup. Not my crowd. Grabbed a few macaroons on the way out that were delicious, only reason I am giving 2 stars.

The menu on this page is not the menu for this location. We were looking forward to waffle fries and chicken tenders but they don't have a fryer. The meat is tough and sides are bland!! Will not be back - very disappointed. If you want bbq, go to little miss bbq!!
