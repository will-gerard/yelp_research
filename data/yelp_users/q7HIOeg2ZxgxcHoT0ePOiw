It is a convenience store so don't go in expecting Chef Ramsay there. I go in here sometimes for a cup of coffee or a fountain drink and from what I have seen it is a pretty decent store. They do have a decent selection of cold sandwiches here and by the register they have the hot dogs rolling, pizza, and few other hot food items. You can be out of there in probably 5 minutes with a meal. I'm not saying it will be the best meal you've ever had, but it is a 7 Eleven.

I went here for work. They place simply put, amazing. It is like a little oasis in the middle of nowhere. The major road out front, can't hear it. They have a lot of seating areas and the way it is decorated makes you feel relaxed. They people that I ran into that works they were absolutely friendly. Didn't get to see the rooms as we were there for a conference. I think I would like to take my wife there for a little relaxing.

Great selection of fresh produce there. They have a deli counter that have a good selection of food at a reasonable price. They usually have good weekly ads. They staff there is extra friendly and the store is clean. They have covered parking for your vehicles to stay ice cold

I'm not big on reviewing Starbucks, but I have to say that this is a great Starbucks. Going there a few times, I have to say the baristas are fantastic. They are quite friendly and get drinks quickly and right. I don't think I've been there with a bad barista yet.

This is not a huge library, but they a nice selection of books, movies, and periodicals there. The child selection is pretty big and they have computers in the area dedicated for child use only. I like how you have to reserve the child computers; if not I do not think some of the kids would ever get off. There are some that just hover over the other kids that are trying to use them. Friday's the library is closed, but they are open on Sunday's. Make sure if you drop off your kids at this library, you are there before it closes. They are not allowed to wait outside the library after it closes, a parent has to be there to get them. I think this is a pretty good rule they have there to keep kids safe. I overheard one of the librarians tell a kid if his parents were not there before it closes they would have to contact the police. Keep your kids safe. They have different passes for some museums around the Phoenix area. I cannot remember how many you can get per month.

We have gotten pizza from here a few times. It is super simple ordering from them. They do actually flip the pizzas the, not roll through a machine like the chains ones do. I don't know why, but I like my pizza flipped not just squished. That's me. The pizza prices are very reasonable and the ones we have ordered hate tasty. My wife did order some boneless chicken wings, once. This is what kind of killed it for me. They looked like nuggets or something similar. Frozen nuggets. They give you containers with the sauce in them, not on the chicken. That was a huge blow for me. I will not order their chicken wings ago. I will stick to my regular place for wings. With that said we still order their pizza. There has not been a bad pizza. The staff there is friendly, from the time we call on to order and the time we get there and pay and leave. Will keep ordering their pizza unless we find something better.

I haven't had any problems here. My food has been correct all the times I've been here and staff friendly. The only thing I can see that they could use on improvement is cleaning tables a little more frequent, but I have seen a lot worse. My kids love to eat here and the food is a lot better than eating at Taco Bell. Still can get cheap tacos here too.

I have not had any problems with this Target. The employees that I have had contact with have been friendly and helpful. They have a food section there, but I have not bought or looked at what kind of selection is available. As far as other merchandise, I have found whatever I had gone in there for. The store is kept clean as far as I could tell. The only complaint I guess I could have about the store is the electric carts could be kept charged. My wife had knee surgery and needed to use one, but the battery seemed about dead. It actually died at the register as we were checking out. I have found this to be the norm though at different stores, so I can't just blame this Target. Overall it is our go to store for stuff besides groceries.

Had a problem with someone stealing my daughters social security number. The incident we know of was at Bank of America so we went there. We have an account there. We told one of the office workers there about what happened and she took down some information. She said her supervisor would call my wife the next day. That day came and went. Well the day after that, my wife Went back down to BofA and she found out that there was some paperwork that my wife was supposed to file out 2 days prior for them that they hadn't given to us. I reported the Problems to the FTC when I was working on the fraud packet and they are supposed to be investigating them. Hope all this will be settled out soon. I

Walked into Sport Chalet and it was just like walking into a big warehouse. I went in looking for some items and passed by at least 4 people including the lady up front and not one of them said a word to me. Nothing like the normal can I help you with something, hello, or even boo. At least at their competitors, like Dick's they will at least greet you and ask if you need help. I guess this and Big 5 are off the list when I need sporting equipment.

Went there on a Friday night and I thought it was going to take a lot longer to be seated than it did. I would say it took less than 10 minutes to be seated. The location of our table was not the best, but I guess someone had to sit there. Our server was right there to take our drink orders and she returned in a few minutes with them. Gave us enough time to decide on what we wanted and if I was given anymore time, I would have changed my mind again. I think between our drinks getting there until us ordering our food, I changed what I wanted to eat 4 or 5 different times. I decided on the fish sandwich. The sandwich was ok, but the great thing is the endless fries. I have an addiction to fries.  There was nothing fantastic about the sandwich, but I could watch a little baseball, enjoy the company I was with, and eat some bottomless fries. Overall, it was a win for me.

I don't know if I went at the right time of day on the right day, but I have to say that I did not have any problems at the ER. It took me probably 5 minutes by the time I walked in the door, checked in, to going  in the back to find out what's wrong with me, and to my room. The doctor was in my room I would say in about 5 minutes as well. I told him my symptoms and before I knew it, I had a nurse, lab tech, and x Ray tech there. The total stay was about 2 hours, but that included CT scan, lab work to come back, pain meds delivered, and release. I tried to go there for my PCM after the care I got at the ER, but the other part of the hospital does not accept my insurance. Bummer.

I have been coming to this CVS for all our family's prescriptions. They can be severely busy in the afternoon. I've noticed the drive through can be slow, but when I have been inside and watch the drive through part of pharmacy, it is usually taking a while because the customers are the ones slowing it down. Whether it be from them asking a lot of questions, arguing about something, waiting for another prescription to be filled, etc. The staff have been friendly and helpful. The phone is non stop ringing when I have been inside as well as a line of people picking up inside and drive through. The pharmacists and the helpers are in constant motion and I haven't had any attitude from any o e there.

I have to write this review on the jewelry counter. My wife wanted to buy some ear rings and there was one family being sold a watch. There was one person tending to the jewelry counters. We could overhear him pressuring them into the extended warranty for the watch. After about ten minutes they finally gave in and purchased it. We are waiting, the overall wait was about 35 minutes. When he was finally done with his sale, he just walked off. We never received a I will be right with you, hello, or even boo. We had to get his attention to try and look at some ear rings and he came over with an attitude. Ended up talking to the manager for such bad attitude and poor customer service. I couldn't see going back there, to the jewelry counter or the store.

I had to go in for a MRI, I must have wrote down the wrong time because my appointment was at 9 and I was there at 8. I had way enough time to fill out their paperwork. Only thing is it is simple so took like 2 minutes. Well I have a lot of time to kill now. Maybe I can watch some Netflix or Hulu Plus. I didn't get the opportunity to do that though. They pull me back like 45 minutes before my appointment. I was so thankful that they were able to do that. They tech was very friendly and he explained what is going to go on. He gave me some ear plugs since the machine is loud. Well I worked all night so I ended dozing off, lol. Before I knew it I was done. I was out of there before my original appointment even started. Sorry SimonMed for getting there so early, but thank you for taking me early.

Was seated quickly when we got there. Our server was a great server. It took a while to make up my mind what I wanted and he was patient with me while I decided. He came back every so often to see if I had made up my mind. We ordered our food and it did not take long for it to come. The portions are a great size. They do not want you leaving hungry. My food was good, a Mediterranean Tuna Pita salad thing. Prices are reasonable. Two meals for about $24.00 and two drinks. It is an inviting atmosphere. I would plan on going back here for lunch or dinner.

I took my 2 kids their for their biannual check and clean. The lobby is small and cramped. If they have more than like 8 people waiting it is crowded. I am not sure how the cleaning went because no one but the patient is allowed to go back even for young children. I am not sure why they would not allow parents to go back with their small kids. After the cleaning was done, I did not talk with the dentist or assistant, I talked to the lady that works up front to check you in. She passes along the information like third party.  We have found a different dentist for them. Do not plan on going back here.

I used to use Vitamin Shoppe quite a few years ago, but once I moved to Washington, I used a local vitamin shop and stopped using them. I try to stay away from GNC as they always try to push that damn card on me. (No I don't want that card that I can only use on the their Thursday of the month between 8-830 in the morning when I am at work). Anyway, I needed some vitamins so I decided to stop in the I was greeted promptly and left alone for a little bit then I was asked if I needed help. I let the lady know I what I was looking for and she narrowed down some choices for me. They had the same brand of vitamins I took in Washington so bingo, that's what I got. Very helpful and courteous. I guess I'm back to using Vitamin Shoppe.

I needed a new PCM. My old Doctor is a family practice Doctor DO. I went to him for a recommendation from the emergency room doctor to follow up with my PCM. I did as the ER doctor said and went in to see my PCM. I told him what was the problem, one quick test, and he says I can't justify anything and the test I am getting ready to have with a specialist shouldn't be authorized. So he is done, won't go back there. Problem though, I need a PCM. Looking to see what my insurance is contracted with and I find this place. I was able to fill out my new patient paperwork a few days before my appointment, saving time in the office. That was a plus for me. My first appointment went well. I felt Stacie spent more than enough time with me to make sure all my questions were answered. She was not judgemental like my old Doctor. She ordered a complete blood work at my first appointment. I saw her again for a follow up and a concern I had. All instances were just as the first. She isn't in a rush to move on to the next patient. I am glad I found this office and I am thankful I found a medical office where the care about their patients.

What bad thing can you say about Dunkin Donuts. They have a great selection of donuts and pretty good coffee. The young man that helped us the last time we went was friendly and patient why my kids and I decided what we wanted. We enjoyed our visit to this location. My kids especially.
