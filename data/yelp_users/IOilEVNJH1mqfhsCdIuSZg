Great service, quick, and friendly. One of the audio techs at Frys Electronics recommended this place to me. My car iPod adapter stopped working and I needed to get it fixed so I stopped by Frys one day. One of the techs told me that they only did installs so he couldn't fix the adapter for me. However, he did recommend this place to me. I went there and I can't remember the kids name but he was a young guy who worked there. He fixed my iPod in a matter of minutes. He said that all somehow the adapter was disconnected and it just needed to be plugged back in at no charge. I gave him some cash anyway for his honesty and great service. I will be back for any future audio needs. This place is highly recommended!

Everytime I've been here they've done an excellent job. They pay close attention to detail and my car comes out looking great. I've gone to other carwashes such as Cobblestone in various locations and time after time I have to point out obvious spots that were missed. I will continue to come here on a regular basis.

This review is specifically for the jewelry department. I went there today to have my battery replaced for my watch. A woman by the name of Alex was working that area. I have to say that she is one of the most helpful sales associates that I've ever encountered. She had a smile on her face and you could tell that she enjoyed her job. She was quick, easy to work with, and we shared a few laughs. Its good to know that theres still exceptional customer service out there, despite the stigma attached to Wal-Mart.

Service was terrible. I was craving Popeyes today and I happened to be in Vegas visiting. We went off the strip to this location hoping for some good ol Popeyes. I was very disappointed. First of all the cashier couldn't speak english but that really wasn'tt the problem. The chicken was very dry. It taste like it had been cooked in week old oil. The mashed potatoes did not have enough gravy and the sandwich was sloppily put together. They didn't even give me a napkin or fork when i was clearly eating in. I went back to ask for sauce and they wanted to charge a quarter per packet! Out of all the popeyes Ive eaten at Ive never had to pay for sauce and it wasnt even like I already had sauce and wanted extra. If I could give this place a 0 i would.

I've taken my 18-105mm lens in to replace the lens mount and the turn around was very quick. Had my camera back within days. I went in today because my Nikon D7000 was out of focus. The woman in the repair/sales department was extremely helpful. She knew exactly what was wrong and fixed it for me. They are always eager to help and they know their stuff.

If you have patience and you're willing to dig you will find some amazing goods in this place for the low. I've come here many times and I've found some brand new Naked and Famous denim with the original tags on them, plenty of Ted Baker items, Allen and Edmonds dress shoes, brand new Valentino jeans, and some clean Nikes.  Its best to come here several times and keep an open mind instead of browsing one time and never returning. Check beyond your size as well because items are constantly out of place and people hide things.  By the way make sure to take allergy medicine before entering.  Also, theres a tailor located just outside the store.

The woman working the South Curb of Terminal 4 was such a sweetheart. Enjoyed talking to her while waiting for the van. Didn't take much time for a van to arrive. Reached my destination quite quickly and will use service again.

The food was fresh. The owner was very generous. Loved their fries. They tasted like hash browns in a way. My gyro was filled to the brim with chicken. Great portions. It was great sober so I can only imagine how it is after a drunken night on Mill.

Went there today because its .99 cent beef and chicken Taco Tuesday all day. When I looked at their daily specials they also listed $4.99 two beef tacos and a drink for Tuesday! That doesn't even make sense. Why even bother having a special like that?! Perhaps the 4.99 deal comes with better meat and the overcooked scraps are used on the .99 cent orders because thats what it tasted like. After finishing my meal my stomach starting turning a little.

My girlfriend was looking on the internet for Urgent Care spots so I could go and take care of my wheezing problem. She suggested this place and told me that first time visitors only pay a $29 co-pay. I took a look at it myself and figured I'd check it out today. When I arrived no one was at the front counter. The lady soon appeared and the first thing she tells me is about a $49 co-pay. I showed her the ad online which clearly stated that first visits are $29. She dismissed that by saying that the ad is over a year old. I was frustrated because she was not helpful at all. She tells me that I would have to wait at least 45 min even though there were only two patients there and all she kept mentioning were prices even though I didnt ask for any of that info. I will not go back to the place. She was rude and left a sour taste in my mouth upon leaving.

I'll go out of my way to come here. The italian ice is always delicious and the flavors are rich. They keep the place tidy and the workers are always generous and upbeat. It would be nice if they did punch cards but thats okay I'll still come by. They have Swedish Fish flavor for crying out loud! What more can you ask for?!

Great quick and friendly service. The manager was willing to let me use the check in coupon even after I had paid for my sub which was cool. I like the variety of subs that are available and all the ones that I've tried have been pretty good.

The first time I had Ikes was in downtown Oakland about a year ago. I have to say it was one of the most memorable sandwiches I ever had. I told everyone about the place as if I was the owner. I was working at a clinic about 5 miles away a few days ago, but had no idea that there was an Ikes Sandwich Shop in town. I'm never in this area because its been dead for years, but now I have reason to go there. I was planning on meeting my girlfriend at Chipotle for lunch. I pulled into the parking lot and saw Ikes off to the side. I was hyped!!! I immediately called her and told her to scratch Chipotle and do Ikes instead. We both got sandwiches and traded halves after I sampled hers. She ordered the gluten free bread and I have to say its the best I've had. The staff was excellent and made great recommendations. I will be back for sure.

Ikes Ikes Ikes you make my day-ay. This is the third location that I've been to and I'm happy to say they're consistent with the food and great service. This location opened up two weeks ago and its kind of hidden. Its tucked in an area thats behind Mill Ave. It didn't take much time to find it, but I'm glad its hidden because only a few know about it so far. When you find it, the trip is totally worth it.

Some friends and I went to LoLos today and we're currently still here. The service started out fine with the bartender but quickly went downhill from there. We all started with waters and shortly after ordered food and drinks. The bartender never brought my Melon mojito but that wasn't the problem.   When our appetizers came out we asked the barback if we could have utensils/napkins for our catfish beignets. The fratboy six roommate in a one bedroom girlfriend sharing barback asks the bartender if for napkins and the bartender shrugs his shoulders and says "Nope, all out," and proceeds his convo with a woman sitting at the bar which he was clearly flirting with. The barback walks off to grab the silverware and when he walks back he snidely says, "You guys need silverware for your beignets?!" Why would you fix your face to say something like that to a customer?! Apparently he doesn't give a damn about making money and keeping customers.  He tried to redeem himself by having conversation with my friends but its too late for that. My mind was made up an hr ago. On another note I will say that the food was good and thats the ONLY reason they even got those two measely stars.

Always fast, hot, and fresh when I come to this location. This is one of the newer Popeyes in the Phoenix Metro area. The customer service is always great and they have yet to get my order wrong. Sometimes they'll even throw in an extra strip at no additional charge. I know its fast food but I'm rating it soley based on other locations and similar establishments (i.e. KFC and Churchs). Popeyes is hands down #1 out of those three.

I liked the decor of the place and it is very clean. The man behind the counter (assuming the owner) greeted me immediately and explained the menu to me. They have a wide selection of flavors to choose from. They put a nice twist on shaved ice because you can add different flavors of ice cream as well as toppings like sweet cream, caramel, chocolate, sprinkles, and marshmallow fluff. The owner was very friendly and engaging. I'm hardly in this area but I'll make it a point to stop by. The shaved ice was excellent and is a great alternative to Bahama Bucks. The plaza seems to be somewhat busy so I really hope they make it. Best of all they use Thrifty Ice Cream!
