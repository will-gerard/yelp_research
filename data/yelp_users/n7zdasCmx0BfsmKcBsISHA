Service was great. Food was quick and piping hot. Been here 30 min and we are full and happy. We ordered the grilled quesadilla as an app then the chimi that ate nogales and the Anaheim chille relleno platter and were amazed! Even just the chips and salsa were excellent. We will definitely be back!
