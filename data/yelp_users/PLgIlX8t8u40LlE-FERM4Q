Good day trip from Phoenix/Scottsdale area... Just be careful if you are relying on GPS to get there.  Mine led me astray for about an hour and after then having to stop and ask twice for directions we were starting to think it didn't exist.  I don't think that area is very well mapped out as it is pretty desolate.  Also, I don't think there are ANY signs for the place until you get to the entrance!  Strange.  Anyways, the scenery is beautiful and the old town was entertaining.  The Saloon seres up overpriced blah food (expected) but it is worth a stop to enjoy the views from the back deck area.  I would say this place is great for kids but still good enough that adults would be glad they came.  Again, for the views and scenery alone I would recommend.

Mmm mmm... Dr Pepper braised short ribs with cheesy grits and a side of green chile mac and cheese.  Would highly recommend both of those dishes.  I'm getting hungry thinking about it!  Nice outdoor seating area and great bar area inside.

Prime aged steaks, fresh seafood, great service and great location in the Waterfront Scottsdale area.  Even had a call the day after from the restaurant to make sure everything was up to expectations.  First class.  It was a little more expensive than I was expecting though.  Not to say that it wasn't worth it but 1 app, 2 entrees, 3 glasses of wine, dessert = 150+ with tip.  Great food though.

Stayed at the Firesky based on reviews here on Yelp and I couldn't have been happier with my choice to do so.  The location is excellent as it is less than a mile from Old Town Scottsdale.  The room was comfortable and had very nice finishes with hardwood, tile, pedistal sink, nice flatscreen tv, 2 cozy queen beds, and a great patio.  The premises of the resort were immaculate with beautiful landscaping, a pool with waterfall, a pool with a mini beach area, jacuzzi, fire pits galore, and all of the comfort and privacy you could ask for with respect to sitting areas around the property.  There is a wine hour from 5-6 every night for free that features a different winery every month.  Everything was fantastic BUT the BEST was the staff.  From the Valets and bellhops to front desk workers they could not have been more nice or genuine.  They even offer a complimentary car service (until midnight I think) where they will drive you in an escalade to dinner so you don't need to worry about driving post wine hour.  All in all I am a huge fan of Firesky and I would return in an instant.  PS- Skip dessert out one night and instead ask the front desk for their complimentary smores packs (1 pack makes 2 smores).  They give you everything you need and you can settle in by one of the fire pits outside roast away.

Phil is the man. Walked in randomly a few years ago and have been back every month or so since. The shop is comfortable, always a game on, leather couches, and plenty of sports memorabilia... but its all about the cut. The first time I walked in I figured 20 mins or so for a quick cut. If it took him 7 minutes I would be surprised (granted I don't have alot of hair left, but still). Took me a while to write this because I would rather not have to wait once the word gets out but they deserve all 5 stars I am giving them.

These are the guys to use... A small chip turned into a 18" crack in a day or so. When I took to the Internet to find a repair company I found lots of company's that use cheap glass but  give you a free gift card.  I was more interested in getting an O.E.M replacement that would last / be compatible with my rain sensor, etc.    When I called, Kelly the owner answered the phone... he was professional, facilitated the claim through my insurance (Geico) at no cost to me, and had his technicians sent to my office to get me fixed up quickly.  His guys Freddy and Robert showed up early (how refreshing) and were done in 40 minutes. Top notch work, local company - they have earned my repeat business (hopefully I won't need them anytime soon!).  Highly recommended, give these guys a call.

Buyer beware - found UTD on Yelp and called to get a quote to mount 1 tv above a fireplace, put a power outlet on that wall, and conceal cables in the wall. The quote was around 350 and I setup an appointment. Guys come out and discover that wall concealment was not possible due to the fireplace being masonry. They said that instead they would just use a plastic wire concealment conduit and run the cables to the adjacent wall. No price adjustment was ever mentioned. I would have just done this myself but they were already there so I figured paying 300 bucks to get it done then would be fine. This is where the experience begins to go south. The invoice I received was for EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS. Had I been informed that the price would be well more than double of the original quote, I would never have agreed to move forward. That was the biggest disappointment as a customer... I have never dealt with a business who doesn't communicate a price to be agreed on prior to beginning a job (especially when someone is under the impression that they will be charged far less based on original quote). I ultimately spoke with the owner via phone who shifted the blame on me for not knowing that it would be more expensive (as if I am in his business???). What I hoped would be resolved by the company owning the issue and making a lifelong customer for future business, ultimately left me with a bad taste in my mouth even with the company making the concession for me to pay what I thought was fair (albeit in a condescending manner). Hate writing a negative review but I gave them the opportunity to resolve this over the course of 3 phone calls, but in the end it became a contentious and negative experience all around.

Cheap rates, nice car (jeep wrangler 4 door for $40/day), can't complain.  I was worried when I came out to the car on day 2 and noticed a dent on the front bumper (it was dark when I picked up the car and it had just been washed and still wet so I didn't see it).  However I called them up when I saw it and they understood and noted that for me so I wouldn't be responsible for the damage.  All I can ask for in a rental.  Would rent there again based on my experience.
