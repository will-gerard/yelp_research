We use Fast Signs for the vinyl lettering on our service vans. Good prices and the colors hold up great in the AZ sun.

Went here for a wine tasting / dinner pairing.  The wine and food were OK, but the service was pretty bad. They crammed the wine tasting / dinner pairing participants in a row of tables so close together the servers couldn't get to you. Heaven forbid you lift your arm to eat, you'd being giving the person next to you an elbow to the ribs. Seriously, shoulder to shoulder. Food and wine were what I expected. Not great, but not bad. Would have given more stars if they had thought the seating through.

Kidstop carries fun, education toys that my kids love! And don't miss their annual Toy Tester event. The event allows your kids to play with a bunch of the toys so you can learn which ones will make great gifts year round. ;')

When I was a kid my parents use to take us here to kill a few minutes of the day. We were bored to death. But wow has this place changed! My kids love coming here and we spent hours exploring the dinosaurs, gold panning, and playing in the real jail cells (about the only thing I remember as a kid enjoying and they're still here). Highly recommended.

Love this place for it's wine list and great appetizers. I've been twice and recommend going just after it opens up for the evening for quite conversation and

I've been to a few events that Bruce Brown has catered. Always incredible food. Always friendly staff.

I use Community Tire for our business vehicles. We're in the service industry and it's critical we get our vehicles out of a service station quickly so they can get back on the road. Community has always been great in this regard and the service managers aren't pushy.

I'm giving the food 5-stars. Outstanding. I had the home made stuffed pasta and a cannoli for desert. Delicious. Only small nit pick is that the restaurant decor is lacking. Bit of a cross between chinese buffet and italian bistro. But food makes it worth it!

A trendy, upscale"ish" restaurant on the east side? Finally! Loved the food, loved the decor. Now just needs some a clientele under 60 ;')
