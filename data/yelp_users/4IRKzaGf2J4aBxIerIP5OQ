Where do I begin? The whole experience was amazing! The restaurant and lounge have a relaxed contemporary feel. The service was first rate. When I first looked at the menu I was overwhelmed with choices. Our waiter could sense this and asked if he could assist in our selection. I was very impressed. He knew every item as if he spent 4 years in college getting a B.S. in Roka Akor. The manager came by several times to make sure we were taken care of. He also brought us several complimentary samples of Shochu which were heavenly.  Dinner was FABULOUS! The gin tara no saikyo-yaki (Grilled Cod) was so good it should be on the desert menu. I took one bite and I swear I almost had an orgasm. The japanese wagyu (japanese beef sirloin with chili ponzu sauce and fresh wasabi) was so tender it melted in your mouth like butter. The sushi was fresh and portions were very generous. The Sake was so smooth it went down like water.  I highly reccomend the experience. Just prepare yourself for the prices. Dinner and drinks ran us almost $400 for two! Still worth every penny!

Where do I begin! Atmosphere is cool. Drinks are "dynomite." It's next door to my work. The staff is well, HOT! WOW! Oh yeah and the food isn't bad either. Really, the food is awesome. It's very healthy and they have an extensive menu and it's very affordable. My favorite is the Shawarma (Mediteranian Roasted Chicken Pita). There are several other locations. If you haven't tried one you should! Get that Whopper out yo mouth get your fat butt off the couch and get something healthy for a change!

I have been doing Martial Arts for years now and have had the pleasure to work with many great trainers. I have studied Tae Kwon Do, Chuan Fa Kenpo, Krav Maga, Jiu Jitsu, Judo, Aikido. In all my expreiences I have never been so offended and dissapointed with a school. I recentlly moved to AZ back in June and have been looking for a place to train. I visited REACT with one of my peers who was also very interested.  Upon arrival we were impressed. The location is clean, great size class rooms, equipment well maintained. We were greeted by a young man who collected our personal information and gave us a tour. During the tour my friend mentioned that we were personal trainers. Instantly our tour was stopped an we were escorted to the door.           First, Krav Maga is a very simplified and very affective system for self defense. It's not rocket science and doesn't take years to learn. REACT is not any different from any other school.           Second, we weren't there as trainers we were there as potential clients. We do very well and don't need to fight with other trainers or studios for work.           Third, any quality school or instructor teaches because the live an breath there discipline. They do it because it's there passion. They exchange that knowledge with others because they want to share. They care about their students like family. This school is obviously focused on the commercial side. The only thing they really care about is your money!            I can't say anything about the quality of training because we were never even given the opportunity.
