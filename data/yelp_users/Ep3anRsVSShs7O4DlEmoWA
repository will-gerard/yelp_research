Love this place!  It's surely not hip, and I read another reviewer say it was for the blue hairs which might be true.  There is no way I could know since nobody but us was there mid-day. But the first course was soup or salad, and I picked an Italian soup which had spinach and parmesan in it and was so thick and delicious.  Then the veal I ordered was in a marsala sauce = excellent.  And the fresh veggies were steamed...well, to perfection.  Just a really great meal for only $10!  Talk about worth it!  This is a meal that IF you ordered it in one of the "hip" spots would cost $25+, so screw "hip." OK, granted the decor is the same old decor that was popular during the Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack era--but I didn't come for the decor.  We came to chat and, at least, this place didn't have some blaring techno music, so we actually could hear each other.  See?  Very unhip.  But we could hear each other talk!   The service was super excellent...and darn! but I am having a really hard time finding many things not to like at Christo's.  I like the place.  I plan to go back....soon.

There is a gal who plays piano there for events with the name Nicole Pesce that is absolutely fantastic and worth your time.  I saw her play and was just blown away--talk about A+ entertainment for the price of a drink and maybe some snack to eat.  If you have nothing to do some day call the Ritz and find out when the entertainment is there and goooooo. You won't regret it!  By the way, she has played for years and for a great number of stars and events, so she is no beginner by any means. Also, valet your car because parking is really hard to do there.

$39.95 for the prix fix dinner which is an appetizer, entree and dessert.  It's such a great deal! And the place is gorgeous for this birthday dinner! Chose the artichoke/lemon ravioli which was perfection.  My son chose the lobster bisque which he loved.  Next I chose the pork tenderloin with sauces and some type of polenta cake (forgive me for not remembering all the unique toppings), he chose the steak with risotto (again, unique toppings with it) = fantastic melt in your mouth eating.  Dessert for me was a chocolate, sea salt carmel cake and he chose a lemon angel food with sherbert....and with that I could barely get up and walk out of the restaurant. Beautiful view of the city as it is so high up, and they sat us inside near the windows for a view.   Fantastic service with 3 people serving you or cleaning up or wiping tables, etc. This is our new go-to place for special dinners or a wedding when that time comes.  The place is beautiful, unique as it is so high up and the architecture of the building alone is so different and just wonderful overall! Have a special dinner coming up?  Try Different Pointe of View, because you cannot go wrong with that choice.  Loved it!

This is the place to go to if you just want to have a drink and sit, look out over the Valley and relax!  My new go to place definitely! The only downside here is the parking.  You park yourself, and when you step out of the car the ground is slanted which makes your brain feel like you are somewhat drunk...very weird feeling.  Then you huff and puff up the hill to the location...not that hard but I like to be dramatic. The building is 32 years old they told me, but, to me, looks older because of the design.  It is lovely, tho, and very serene. I had parked at the end where the parking lot ends facing the hill going down.  Now comes the fun when you leave.  You gotta go into reverse cause if you go into drive you shoot over the parking lot, down a super steep hill and kill yourself.  So, it's important you go into reverse, turn your car around carefully because all the smart people parked in the rows back of you and slowly get out of the parking spot.  Once you do that and straighten the car out it's literally all downhill...not scary once you get out of that parking spot. The head Manager of the restaurant have big delivery trucks that are scared to drive up there.  I get it totally with a big truck! Saturday night had a steady stream of couples coming in to sit, have a drink and stay for a little while before dinner (I guess).   Like I said, this is my new go-to place.  Very pretty, very serene--not cheap as my martini was like $13 or so--but so worth it just for the view and sitting pleasure.

Missing lamp parts?  This is the place.  Need a lamp fixed?  Here, too.  This is a one stop shop for anything to do with lighting. And it will be done correctly.  Nuff said.

FEAST OF THE MIDDLE EAST 2013:  Here is my experience there.  The food was really good and worth it, but since I am not a member of this Church nobody--except for the ticket ladies--even looked my way.  I didn't care as I was looking around myself and enjoying the sights and sounds.   Then I made the fatal mistake of asking what one of the dishes was called to a nearby group of people.  I was polite about it and waited till there was a lull in their conversation to ask.  However, the ladies in the group were so ungracious with a "why are you bothering us" attitude that I just walked away.  Some of the men heard and saw this exchange and were kind, gave me the information plus more of what I was seeking.  It was just a question, ladies, so you don't need to tell your children to not respond to me (which they did).  I am only asking a simple question...but one of them even remarked that I could go back into where the food was sold and ask someone there.  I mean...these were Lebanese women from the Church, so what kind of women go there?  Other than rude, ungracious women who let "outsiders" know they are persona non grata.  Is this Church not aware what a horrible impression they give us "outsiders" with that attitude? Other than that, I did meet some lovely woman with her breastfeeding baby in the restroom who I had a nice conversation with which proves all the women aren't rude there.  Maybe I just hit the nasty group of the Church? Other than that unpleasant experience, the food is delicious, and the entertainment started at 5 pm which I didn't get to see since I couldn't find a chair inside the church.  Now I see why everyone was in their seats at 3 pm talking.  They were waiting for the show to start and know how limited seating is.  I get it. I give this festival a 2 star because the food is great! They have alot of bouncy things for children to play on, they have tons of delicious food and lots of parking on the street in a very lovely area of the city with beautiful homes. They lose 3 stars for the non-friendly attitudes of the festival goers from the Church.  Prepare to bring your own posse to talk to if you go to this Festival is all I'm say'n. The most positive note about the Lebanese who go to this Church is that the men seemed friendly and their Priest waved at me from afar.  That was nice. A review on here about this Church says they are "one big family"....yeah, one big family who doesn't want outsiders to come there even to visit.  And the Priest seems so friendly, too...go figure? As a last note:  What a difference in attitudes of the Greek Festival at St. Halambros Church where every single person working there is more than happy you are there no matter if you are an outsider or Church member, also have delicious food and are so warm and welcoming.  Take a lesson, St. George!

Interested in a Carrier A/C?  This is the place to call! Good price and good warranty and good after-program (in fact, great after service with 2 free checkups a year). Did lots of research on who to use and had it down to this firm and another.  I went with Trane ultimately, but Carrier is also great and was a hard decision for me to make between the two.  However, if I were to not buy Trane this is the company I would use. They really have an exceptional program for their clients that I didn't see anywhere else, and I would definitely trust their service as they have many great yelp reviews here. Carrier is an old line a/c company with a great reputation, but I just wanted to change out the Trane I had before--otherwise, Carrier it would be. David Bird was the rep who came out who will be more than happy to explain everything in their program to you.  Nice people here, too. This is a solid company with a very good reputation for a reason.

Who knew the Armenians were so very friendly and smiling to strangers?  Brought a friend to this church's annual Middle Eastern Festival as he was in town for a day.  What a good move on my part, because we both really had a good time there.  Great people in this church for sure. They had things to purchase (I purchased some baklava to bring home), food to sell and items like paintings, jewelry, purses, food goods, etc.  Nice selection of things. I had to knock off a star for the quality of the food, tho.  The tabouleh was the worst I have ever had which is a shame.  I love tabouleh, so I was really bummed.  The hummus was just ok, and the sarma (dolmades) which is rice wrapped in grape leaves were very good. My friend bought the chicken kabob meal, which he wolfed down so guess it was fine. They brought a good number of young people from California--and the Armenians sitting with me were only too glad to tell me how many huge settlements have taken over which cities in California--in to do traditional dances.  That was fun and interesting.  They really had some nice, nice costumes, too.  Loved it! And they had a lady singing their songs with a band with their native instruments, which everyone enjoyed.  Good entertainment! Try their beer!  It is really, really good beer both of us thought.  Much like Amstel and very tasty. If they will work on bringing up the quality of their tabouleh and hummus I'll gladly put the star back just 'cause the people were so wonderful there.  I hit all the Middle Eastern church festivals when I find them because Middle Eastern is my fav ethnic food...but the food here was disappointing (altho not anywhere near as horrid as Holy Trinity's Greek Fest..barf!). Work on the food, Armenians...leave the people alone (they're wonderful!)!  Just my suggestion.

Want authentic Thai like you were in Bangkok?  This is the place in Phoenix to find it! Tried 3 dishes:  one soup made with coconut milk, one papaya salad and one pad thai--all mild--all excellent. Every single thing here is made TO ORDER per customer! Every item is super fresh and purchased that day!  We got this information straight from the wait person who works there. A really hardworking Thai woman does all the cooking for everyone, and she is really great at it, too.  Her food is authentic and not some Americanized version of Thai which doesn't need played with as so many place do (thinking Malee in Old Town Scottsdale). I'll definitely be back here.  Love it!  I felt I was sitting at a cafe in Thailand again...sigh...so many memories.

I used to see a very fine Dr. there, and the Dr. was okay but was either let go or quit one day as I got the coldest letter I ever received from any physician's group saying the Dr. was no longer there (I heard that particular Dr. just got fed up with all the internal disorganization and problems there with the staff)--BUT, 1. you could NEVER EVER get anyone that worked for the Dr. to answer the phone, so if you had an emergency or real need you were out of luck and 2. the staff here never could help either.   Finally, I switched Doctors to another group out of frustration.  However--and here is the real problem--I called 3 times to ask for my records to be sent to the new physician.  No records sent, so after some months I actually called the Supervisor of the Medical Records Section who promised to have my records sent that day.  Nothing ever came!  Nothing!  And this was the Supervisor of the Department---unbelievably bad! After some more months, I finally went to the new physician, signed some releases for them to get the records--and guess what?  They didn't get them either. FINALLY, after a YEAR (yes, I said a YEAR), my new physician physically went over to their office to retrieve my records himself!  Yes, it is that bad! It was good luck that kept me from being ill on an emergency basis that year as my new Dr. would never have had the old records to see if I had gotten sick. I would never ever suggest anyone use this poorly run place.  Their service is horrid, and, trust me, you are nothing more than a number there--and they really do not care at all about you. Horrid place:  you have been warned!  Their service is non-caring and totally disgustingly bad!

For Chinese in Phoenix, this is my place now.  Just discovered it, and boy! do I love their food. I usually judge a Chinese restaurant by how good their hot 'n sour soup is, because most places seem to have no clue how to make it--but Abacus surely does.  The best hot sour I ever had loaded with chunks of veggies and flavored just perfect! Had their lemon chicken, and the meal was so huge I brought half home--all for something like $8.  The prices are right here! Everything here seems to be good according to my tablemates, too. Cannot wait to hit this place again!

Out of kindness I am giving this place a 2 star just for the good crust--and it is really good crust--but their idea of pizza is lots of tomato sauce.  Where is the cheese?  I ordered extra mushrooms and pepperoni, and the owner is so cheap that he scrimps on anything that costs him money--altho he has no problem taking yours (money, that is). Never again will I order their pizza cause it sucks totally. Their ziti is good.  Stick with that.    On another note, try going in there with a Groupon-type coupon and you will find you cannot order anything that smells of happy hour prices or any of the specials listed on the blackboards.    I think the person who runs Grimaldi's at this location sits and thinks of any way he can cut costs--even if it means a pizza with so little cheese you need a search party to send out to find it.  He gives so little as he can on the extras you order for the pizza, too.  All he does is give you lots of the cheaper stuff like flour and water crust and tomatoes which aren't expensive.  I get what he's doing, and hope some here aren't so blind and stupid that they don't get it.  Very disappointing management decisions.  Either raise prices so you can give better food or close up.

Used to eat at one of about 4 of this chain's restaurants in Houston all the time, but I can say hands down that this is the filthiest one I ever ate at.  I grabbed a spoon, happened to look down at it (oh, gawd..how I wish I hadn't) and it still had scum marks from food on it.  So, I checked out all the spoons (about 15 were there) and they all were that way...mmmmmm...doesn't that make you just want to dive in here? It's filthy, the food isn't all that good and not worth even their cheap $6 as a Sr. To hell with it!  I'm going to some place I know is clean like Cheesecake Factory next time. Two words:  never again.  (I'll probably have nightmares tonight over dancing dirty spoons now, too...brrrrr...shudder!).

Huge portions, good decent food--but it's the pies they are famous for.  I had the pecan, son had the lemon  and both were good.  I did notice it tastes as if butter is in the crust just like Mama made, and Mama was a champeeeen pie maker.  If she were alive today she would approve! This is a cute, little place on the way to Prescott, and since I had always wanted to go to Hogs 'N Heat and never made it, we decided to eat here. OK, 2 meals with one drink and 2 pies later with 1 coffee the bill came to $50!  Yikes!  This is my only complaint there and that it's ridiculously pricey for the place.   Would I go again?  Probably but I would watch what I order next time and try and stay under $30.  It isn't that's I'm poor, it's because I think that the total amount is way too costly for 1. the place and 2. the food we ordered which was rather commonplace. Hogs 'N Heat is $12 I think which is a much better deal than ordering a la carte like we did. Good food and too much of it really (not that we didn't eat it all but that was it for the entire day), great service from our waitress but a little too pricey really for where it is at.  Just say'n.  Note:  They do have fried pickles there which puts it into the excellent category for me...LOL!

Not the cleanest laudromat or newest I've ever seen by far--kinda old and funky--but it does the trick.  I used the biggest washer they had for a comforter and boy! does it work well.  Says you will get your stuff out sparkling white--and I only used a Costco detergent--and it sure does!!! The washer takes awhile cause it goes thru many cycles to really wash your stuff, and the dryer will take about 42 minutes or 6 quarters to dry a cotton comforter.  Not bad really considering the only other way I could clean my comforter was going the dry cleaning route which will be more than $6.50 for sure. Bring a book to read or wander around to the shops in the center. The only negative I have is there was nobody to help show you how to work the machine and where to put in the soap the first time.  The only employee I saw which I think was the owner's daughter (he was fixing a washer totally from scratch it looked like) just ignored everyone,  A nice lady helped me, and I ended up helping 2 others that came in individually where to put the soap and so forth.

I've used Sun City Express 2 times so far, and I can honestly say I love this company!   Always on time--except when you come back you have to call them from the airport, and they pick you up as quickly as they can IF they aren't already there.  Last trip when I came in from Buenos Aires they knew I would be arriving at a certain time and, even tho they had 2 other people in the van already, the driver waited for me outside the airport, so all I had to do is...well, walk outside the walls of the airport.  EZ!  And when they know to pick you up at 6:30 am they arrive at my house exactly at 6:30 am.  So far they haven't even been a minute late.   They have always helped me with my bags and even offered a hand to help me into the van when I needed it...and sometimes I do cause it's so early or I'm so tired I'm liable to trip myself getting into the van.  Their prices are the lower than Super Shuttle I know.  There are other shuttle services in the area, but none compare to the overall service and price offered by this company I think.  They seem to have been here a good amount of time, since when I first called and gave my address the Dispatcher automatically knew what community I lived in (much to my surprise).  I do alot of international travels, so when I return and am pretty beat from 20 hours of flights it's always good to know the nice people at Sun City Express will be waiting to take me home.  This is definitely my go-to company for rides to and from the airport.

Wonderful service, but the price for what you get is a rip.  I ordered some chicken with lemon and capers dish and that is all you get:  3 pieces of small chicken breasts in a lemon sauce with some capers = $25.  Granted, the chicken is cooked perfectly, but the sauce is certainly not like the wonderful chicken piccata they used to have (no more piccata there).  Just too expensive to get 3 thin pieces of chicken breasts and NO sides for that amount of money. My friend got some pasta dish that was also overpriced and, for me, way too spiced with flakes of red chilis which was too hot.  She liked it...but both of us left saying we would never go back because of the ridiculously overpriced meals there. Now if the chicken dish came with some sides maybe...but just the chicken only for that price:  think not.   We tipped the nice waiter very well, cause it isn't his fault. Sorry, Buca, you've gotten too pricey for me for what you serve.  You aren't the Ritz Carlton, and I'm not coming back and either is my friend.  UPDATE:  Ate there again with another.  Again, fantastic service and I mean fantastic!  I didn't like what I ordered, so when a Manager came by and asked I told him (well, I've never been accused of being shy).  He takes the plate and returns with something I had mentioned I loved.  I mean, how can you beat that???? Now the food quality:  Again, excellent!  Had the antipasto salad which was a fresh and crisp and delicious as it could be.  The entrees were cooked perfectly and don't start me on the tiramisu which is beyond great.   Now for the price which was the main complaint I had before:  Again, there was just two of us, but we went for lunch this time.  The bill came to $60 for 2 entrees, the salad, the huge tiramisu and one lemonade--BUT for all we had--and we brought home probably more than half of it, so now we have a whole nother dinner--the food is definitely priced right now AND everything was fresh!  FRESH!  And authentically cooked (having spent some time in Italy I feel I have some idea).  Where you could really make out with their food and pricing is if you have a party of 4 or more--and if you have 10 people in your party you could super makeout here.  If nothing else, you always know the quality of the food and the service is just superior.

For a bar--in the Summer heat--sitting outside with misters and sunscreens around this place was great!  Not even hot!  Can you believe it? We had fried pickles (good), burgers, chicken sandwichs, etc. etc.  Everything was really good tasting. From what I understand, The Moon is owned by another group here, but it surely feels like a mom and pop place as 1. the food was great and the 2. service was great. Good choice of drinks, too. Our group was some 30 year olds, some 50 year olds and some 80 year olds, and the general opinion of the groups is we want to come back here!

I've always thought the decor and atmosphere was fun and yet somewhat cozy at Elephant Bar, and the food was pretty decent--nothing to write home about--but decent. However, I had their Chicken Marsala yesterday which is chicken stuffed with whatever it's stuffed with, mashed potatoes and gravy and I can say it is really mmmm mmmmm good!  I loved it!  In fact, I refrained from licking the plate, which is what I would have loved to do it was so darn good. Frankly, I've never really had anything there that was bad...just nothing that was superior.  But I do like that Chicken Marsala plate alot. As Ahnold says, "I'll be back."

For a fast food burger Whataburger is great!  I've come thru their drive-thru many times over the years and never had a very long wait.  If you get a bad burger or something is wrong, believe me when I say it has happened to me once, I wrote to the corporate office, and they corrected the problem pronto.  Whataburger really cares to retain customers and make you happy.  I like the taste of their burgers, because they use....real meat!  I would rather go here than McDonald's, because I really am not sure they do use real anything there (i.e., fake meat, fake ice cream and so forth).  The biggest plus with Whataburger is if you ruin the turkey for Thanksgiving Day, Whataburger is open every day of the year including Xmas...LOL!

Work:  Unbelievably great!  Fantastic work and my fender looks totally new.  Cost:  They aren't cheap---unless the $2,200 they charged with me paying only the $500 deductible was to gouge the insurance company.  I hope so, anyway.  But the work...fantastic work!!!!  Well, here's something interesting:  I just called 4 auto body places in my area to fix my grill and they ALL had the same price.  I asked why and one of the guys told me that there are 2 places people in the NW Valley buy supplies from, prices are fixed then so they all are the same.  Moral of this story:  If all the places charge the same and you live in the NW Valley, go to A&D Auto.  They really are the best around!

Need a good laugh?  Go into Ritzy Rags, engage the owner in conversation and then plunk on her that you just love going to "junk" stores and pick up items (whatever? Gucci purses, Fendi scarves, Prada wallets, etc.), too. Better yet, tell her you shop Goodwill all the time.  She will fume so much that the frost starts to grow over the whole store.  It's a hoot!!!! OK stuff, tho.  Just who wants to pay $400 for an obviously dry cleaned more than a few times Escada sweater coat?  Too high for the quality.

"$1.50 cheaper per dozen for the same exact cookies you could buy at the NY Bakery next to Brunk's Auction on Grand Avenue on the West side.  Excellent cookies, excellent service.  I will be returning here!  Yes, I will.  I need a little more cellulite on my thighs I guess...  PLUS, last time I was there with my son--who someday will be getting married (fingers crossed)--I looked at cakes in general.  Their prices for the same wonderful tasting cakes you get anywhere is sooooo much cheaper it was surprising.    If I need anything from a cake to cookies, this is the place I am getting it from.

Came in with a Groupon, otherwise, I'd never have found this place--and what a find it is!  Prices are excellent, quality is excellent, service is excellent. I'd suggest you use Baker Wee for alot of your cookie buying.  I know I am.  I love this place!!!!  By the way, I have been in there two times near holidays, and they do some really cute cookies each holiday..cool!

This is one review I feel horrid writing anything negative since the lady owner was so accomodating to us (and actually cared if we liked the food), however, I eat an awful lot of my favorite ethnic food and feel pretty qualified to write on it.   OK, the hummus was really fresh which was a plus but, for me, a tad too much garlic  altho my table companions liked it (so I'll shut up).  Good pita served with it that was toasted just right, tho. The gyros itself and the pita were A+, the tzatziki had a little too much dill in it, and where was the diced cucumber I am so acclimated to in it?  But the tzatzkiki consistency was thickish which is right, because sometimes stores make it way too thin and runny. But the gyro was muy good.  Why do other gyros joints don't have fresh cooked meat like this and their gyros are always so overcooked and burnt?  Not at King Gyros.  Very fresh cooked meat = wonderful and juicy like it's supposed to be. The baklava was good, too, but no nuts made it go somewhat downhill.  I miss the nuts..sorry.  I'd pay for the nuts to be put in it myself. But the gyro meat--and the nice, fresh pita bread--tops!!!  Some of the best cooked gyro meat I've ever had...and they don't skimp on the servings either since you get a really fat portion of meat with none of this fake-you-out-by-using-fillers-like-lots-of-lettuce-on-top stuff.  Worth the trip just to get the gyro, frankly...it's superb!!!!  The BEST I've had here so far! Definitely trying this place again.  I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars, so--in the name of strictly testing (yeah, sure)--I have to come back and re-test all.  See?  Anything for fairness...gawd, but I love that excuse to eat great food.... Prices are very reasonable, by the way.

Gorgeous location looking out over the city--what's not to love? Drinks are made by really good bartenders.  Bar food is mediocre in my opinion, but when you drink who cares what you eat? Getting there with my Garmin gps was fun, since it directed me into someone's driveway...but I found the place.  It is out of the way so prepare yourself. This is a beautiful spot, very romantic on a weekend night.  Quiet enough to have a good time with your special person I say...go for it!

My friend took me here to eat dinner and WOW! I am in love...with the food and not him.  Anyway, since he is Persian he showed me how to eat it, since they have such different traditions.  I mean, there is a platter of raw basil leaves just plucked from the plant on the table that you put on a piece of thin warm pita bread, spread hummus on it with a piece of onion and basil on top, roll it up in your fingers and eat away....who knew? We got the chicken and beef kabobs, and typical Persian food it is all served on a platter which means to-go boxes at the end. Try the yogurt with dill drink for something really, really unique.  Very different. Service is good, prices for dinner are somewhat high but lunch is very reasonable. I love this place!  I cannot wait for my son to come into the city, cause I am taking him there for sure.  This one is a super winner!!!!

Hamburger (corn fed variety which means it's from Iowa) was good, chips and salsa were ok but what I loved about this place was sitting there for 2-1/2 hours and looking out at the beautiful yard with the hill in the distance.  Boy, when I find a guy to go out with we're going there....muy romantico! Cute, clean, nice place and would I go back?  Yup...sure would. The lunch to me was just okay, but I was with a whole bunch of girlfriend and with the good service and excellent view...well, it was just a perfect place for a long chat.

A/C totally died the hottest day of the year so far, and Mast came out with a bid the next day (they work 7 days a week in the heat).  Great bid on a Trane which is what I wanted, and they have a really great reputation from all the research I did on them before calling. Mast will do the job right!  And they will give you tips on how to keep your house cool and warm depending on the season. My air was not circulating properly because the equipment installed originally in this house was incorrect, so Mast went out and rebuilt the equipment I needed on their own dime so the air would do it's thing the right way.  I love this customer service! I love Mast and will stay with them.  What a great company!!!! Plus, they keep their appointments right on time which I found is rare with many of the A/C-heating companies here.  That could be a plus when I have to work for sure. Again, what a great company!!!!

I've been to a number of auctions in both Texas and Illinois, and I can say that this is one of the best auction houses I've seen.  Tons of stuff--mostly great with some crap thrown in for diversion I guess--but they run a well-run auction house. I had a license to do auctions in Texas for a part of my life and do have some knowledge of how they should be run and this one is good. Just prepare to spend from 8 am to maybe 3 or 4 pm if you want to see the whole thing.  It makes for a very long day...not that you HAVE to stay all day.  You can just stay for the portion you are interested in and leave or figure out how to time it anyway. The girls who answer the phones and greet you at the window will help you as they are very courteous to all I find and very glad to help. However, a friend who was with me wanted a baby carriage for a doll she had as a child.  She got an antique turn of the Century one for $75, so when I got home priced it for her on the net:  $250. Yes, if you have the patience this is what you can sometimes do at these auctions, so just hang in there and adopt the Patience is a virtue philosophy.

They did fix my car but I found out later I was overcharged probably $200.  Was that cause I was a woman? My fella had his car repaired and they did a good job, BUT they put an item on his car which will require him to have another $1,000 repair.  He is really unhappy. I thought they did a great job till all this came to the front. ALSO, they seem to have lost their affiliation with AAA which seems suspicious.  WHY would AAA drop them???   Guess we are not going back there.   Really NO BUENO!  Update:  The car my boyfriend spent $3K on there to fix last year that Mike's claimed would last "forever" if he would just fix some things now has soooo many leaks it would be another $2K.  He's just chucking it and buying a new car.   However, either Mike's doesn't know car repairs--which I seriously doubt--or they are so greedy that they blow smoke just to get your money. Well, Mike, you got our money, but you lost 2 good customers....REALLY NO BUENO! More disappointing because we thought Mike's was a good shop and had used them for a number of years...soooo disappointing.   UPDATE:  OMG!  Someone just pointed out all the horrible reviews on Mike's on Google and also all the complaints he has with the BBB!  If we had looked there before taking any car to Mike's we would never have let them do any work at all.  Wow...they have alot of complaints and horrible reviews...beware!!!  I think I see what another auto shop (not a repair one, tho, so they are not a competitor) told me when they said AAA dropped them.  I see why now.

I was there last week and really saw some interesting items--some of which I have owned or still own--on sale there for really high prices.  Of course, they knock off about 20% it seems from the posted prices if they think you are a serious buyer I found. Since I was there before 9 am when they open, no line needed to form as there weren't all that many of us (maybe 15).  We got in right away. After hitting this shop I visited 4 other pawn shops in Vegas just to see what they have, and I have to say unless you are interested in jewelry, tools or electronic equipment there is nothing else to see.  Very disappointing. I can tell that what has happened is this store has gone into finding very unique/high quality items to sell, and probably the staff works from another location as the crazy tourists would drive them nuts in the day.  Makes sense to me totally as I would be in the back room or at home if I owned this shop and had a tv show, too. For those of us who have some knowledge of antiques and upscale items, this is the place to look in Vegas for sure.  I'm sure with their contacts they find many items for collectors that the public never gets to see. Interesting shop--despite it's small size--with many unique items to the trained eye. I have to admit I did kinda chuckle when I saw the build-out of their shop was loaded with tourist gifts.  Yeah, the public is that stupid to buy Chumlee t's and jackets I guess. Parking is plentiful in the lot attached to the building, so I have no clue what one poster was talking about when they said there was no parking.  There was a huge lot to the left of the building. Lots of help there, so don't get any idea about getting sticky fingers either. Is this worth the time to visit when in Vegas? Unless you are a collector or love/have knowledge of antiques and collectibles probably not.  You won't see the Old Man, Rick or anyone from tv there anymore...sorry.

2 days I had a strip steak at The Cafe if you can believe it.  That should tell you how darn good their food is....darn good!!!! However, unfortunately The BBQ doesn't open until 4 pm and if you get there later you will have to wait awhile to get it (30 minutes, 20 minutes).  But the food I saw people eating--and the price I heard they paid for it (so inexpensive for the quality)--has me planning a trip to The BBQ there next trip to Vegas.  Dang but the bbq rigs looked fantastic!!!  I mean FANTASTIC!!! Only drawback to this place is all that smoke from the casino...cough, cough...if you can hack that you can eat there.  Actually The Cafe doesn't stink inside but still...walking thru all that smoke is no treat at all.  Just focus on the wonderful dinner you will have once you get thru all that smoke...it's worth it.

Love the pretty atmosphere outside in the garden with umbrellas.  Good service and good food, so what's not to love? Split an order of nachos that was huge.  Only complaint is there could have been alot more chicken and cheese--and maybe some mild sliced jalapenos on the side and a little more quac and sour cream, but excellent overall. Also, had the trout lunch special which was trout, sweet potato and some greens that were stir fried.  Good taste--fishy but it was trout which is fishy usually. I love this place, so will be back.  It's kinda hidden and out of the way which I loved myself.  This is a place great for talking to your tablemates or for a romantic dinner.  And one of the things I particularly loved about Chelsea's is that nobody rushes you out the door.  And, by the way, when going out the door look to your right at the bunch of carmel chocolate salted cookies under a glass trifle container--take some for your ride home = they're free! Valet parking which is free, but we came so early we parked ourselves.

This place must be good because out of 50 customers there were 2 Black ladies and my white self--and 47 Asians speaking Chinese.  I trust that means the food is authentic and good. I had a couple dim sum dishes but the best thing was the duck...OMG!  It was the first time in my life I ever had duck that I liked...no changed that to loved!   Go here for authentic Chinese, peeps..you won't be sorry!

Great food here:  the Ultimate Burger which we got just for signing up as a member here so it was free and bought 1/2 slab ribs (the country rib type that has more meat).  Just fantastic! The waitress even brought some of those homemade chips over so we could try their 5 types of sauces before the food came which was appreciated. We liked the Mustard sauce so well we bought a bottle. The sides were good, too:  mac/cheese, potato salad and cole slaw.  The cornbread they serve with the ribs...again, excellent. I can honestly say we didn't have one complaint about the food:  all expertly prepared and just wonderful! As for the waitress, she was tops!  She even gave us big cups with lids, straws and a lemon for me (I drink water) when we left.  She gave us such fantastic service we left a 30% tip!  That should tell you something. Will we go back?  You bet your sweet ribs we will...I LOVE this place!!!

Yes, yes and hell, yes!  The food--I had veal piccata the small portion--was delicious and more than enough. My friend got the large size veal parmigiana and she had to take more than half home for the next day.  Her portion was that large, so maybe it is smarter to get the large order for a little more and get 2X the food. They put bread that's toasted with garlic and olive oil on the table first which was dee-licious!  Obviously, I totally blew the Atkins all protein diet with that bread basket, but it was sooo good! I just love the food here, so this is now my new go-to place for real Italian.   ***Keep up the good work at this location, but you need to kick the 83rd Ave. location and get them cooking like the 59th Ave. location.  I've eaten at both, and they just are not the same:  different cooks make a difference.

This is a quaint and cute place to eat authentic German food when the mood hits.  Really liked it overall. Had the 6 sausages with sauerkraut and potatoes which was good--not fantastic--but good.  For dessert split two desserts with a friend which was apple struedel (the very best I have ever had) and the chocolate sauerkraut cake which was sooo chocolatey.  Loved the struedel most. Tasted the giant pretzel which is good, but to me not worth the $8.95 which is kinda pricey for what it was.  I mean, really?  Flour and water and $8.95? Regardless, if I ever crave in my entire lifetime German food this is where I will go.   It's good, but there was a German restaurant in Houston that blows this place out of the water which I wish was duplicated here in Phoenix but isn't. Overall, okay place...just the food didn't want to make me yodel at all.

This is the wedding of a smart owner and some great cooks in the kitchen.  First off, they have a small--probably 8 tables at most and that's counting several 2 person tiny tables--cafe offstreet in an alley.  We had a little problem finding it with the gps but we did.  He does have tons of parking, tho, across the street so that's no problem for those of you who worry. When we went last night in mid-January he had plenty of tables outside with many people sitting out there and even his hostess podium there, too.  Very smart move. Nobody seemed to mind it was winter and sitting outside, so I can only guess it was suitably warm out there.  We, however, were sat inside right next to the kitchen.  But, then again, if you are inside the cafe you will always be somewhat close to the kitchen. Now, the service:  Either this owner has told his servers to realllly take care of the patrons or we got the world's greatest server.  This gal (I'm guess 40's, long blonde hair) first gave us when we said we'd order sangria 2 tastes of both white and red for us to decide which one.  We went with the white that night.  It was good, but, having lived in Spain, it wasn't really authentic sangria.  Where was the fruit that always goes in sangria a la Spain?  Oh well...still good tasting. The lady server also gave us 2 free empanadas for me and my gal pal to taste.  OMG!  I have never ever liked empanadas because the crust is always crap and the filling is always dry or dull.  But these empanadas...like nothing I have ever tried before:  judgment is fantastically delicious! We both ordered the pork dinner which is pork shoulder (pulled pork to you) sans any sauce which comes on the side.  It's a whitish sauce--I think they called it mole or moro or something--that was light and delicious to me.  I poured it all over my huge portion of pork. I also ordered the special potatoes (wonderful!) and the creamed corn (a tad jalapeno hot for me but not bad at all).  My friend ordered the jalapeno bread, and I will get that next time as she gave me a taste....and, again, delicious. I consider myself somewhat of a foodie, and I say this place is soooo worth going to again and again.  Great food!  And even my gal pal who has some kind of intestinal bowel problem said she wanted to go back she loved it so much. This is my go-to place to eat in Phoenix now when I want some Spanish-style foods.  Fresh, delicious and you REALLY get taken care of here.  I love this place, and I can tell by this young owner's attitude that he really wants you to love his food and his service...and to enjoy yourself.  We did, we do and we will definitely be back here!!!! My prediction from the smart way the owner has set his place up that he will go very, very far in the restaurant business.  Clever set-up, great food, great service = a whopping success!!!!  (Oh, forgot:  The lady server--since we went between getting the short rib or the pork--also brought us a couple bites of the short rib to taste.  Is that fantastic service or what????)  UPDATE:  Been there a couple times now and ordered the same thing as before--only they didn't give up any free empanadas that night.  Dang...we were so stuffed anyway we could hardly get up from the table.  Food still delicious, tho! I love this restaurant, and plan to bring my ex-Chef son here to eat soon.

I've eaten here with gusto it was so good.  Can't remember what I had a year ago, but I had a Maytag blue cheese burger (which was so melted on the burger I actually asked where the cheese was, but you sure could taste it..yum!) and it was superb!  Came with a big whopping hunk of homemade cut fries--which I certainly didn't need but loved scarfing down like a hog!  Just fabulous quality of food here. Their meat--and I mean the hamburger quality--is excellent, too, for what America offers (nothing compares to the beef in Argentina where I just returned from). Love this place so much told the son to take a date there if he wants to impress her with good food.  Atmosphere is nice, service was great, just love this place! One of my very fav places to eat here in Phoenix for sure under $20 each!  Yummy delicious food here!!!

The paper itself if okay, but I took it for 4 years and now I cannot get them to quit delivering it.  I have asked them 4 times so far--once even getting an email saying they would take care of it from the Customer Service Manager and to recontact her if the delivery continues.  Well, it continued alright--but I couldn't even get her to respond to email #5.   I am sick and tired of getting the Arizona Republic.  They aren't charging me for it, but I don't want the hassle of getting it from the front yard even.  NEVER TAKE THIS PAPER UNLESS YOU WANT TO GO THRU THE SEVEN TORTURES OF HELL TRYING TO GET THEM TO STOP DELIVERING IT TO YOU!  And, from what I hear from friends at my community pool, this is their "way."  I hate the Arizona Republic at this point.  Quit delivering it to my driveway....please.

The owner told me he makes his gelato just the way he made it in Rome. Well, Rome's loss is Phoenix's gain, because I think his gelato is about the best I ever had--and I've eaten gelato all thru Italy and I can prove it by my pants size.   Only one place had gelato this good in Italy to me, and that was near the art museum in Florence. This is gelato at it's finest!  Only complaint I have is that it's too far from my home...pooh!

The night I left before a trip to Italy I ran in and purchased a digital camera (never used one before) at Best Buy.  The salesguy was happy I had done my homework before and knew what I wanted. Since he offered to help me with any problems knowing I had no clue as to how to work a digital, he said read the information and come in if you need help.  I did.  Next morning I ran in after getting the basics done, but I had some trouble with time/date stamp so what I didn't do they did for me free.  Now that is what I call superior service!!!  I was so very grateful as I had so little time to figure all this out before my plane left. I ALWAYS get fantastic service at Best Buy, so I cannot imagine why others would complain at all about their service.  It's personal and excellent. I'm always greeted at the door pleasantly, too, and asked if they can help me.   I love Best Buy!

OMG I love this   place!!!  Super deals on everything from shampoo to cheese to candy to meat.  This is going to be one of my regular stops from now on before I hit my other fav, Winco. Example:  2 lb. Tillamook cheese was $4.99 instead of $11!  This is a better deal by far than Costco. Only negative is if you see it grab it cause the stock changes depending on what is available as an overrun. And check all their shelves for goodies:  I buy Contigo mugs to carry my water and ice in seeing that I usually use Mio and tap water and with the pricey--but unspillable Contigo mugs--I can carry them in the car or put them on my desk and not worry about any spillage.  Well, the aluminum ones that keep the water cold almost 24 hours cost $25 each on Amazon and I found them packed as 2 for $19 at Grocery Outlet, so I bought 2 packs of them--see what good deals you can find there if you just look around!!!!!  BOTH locations in Phoenix closing 10/6/2014.  Closest one in California.  I'm very sad.

New owners as guess 24 years there was enough for the old owners.  Don't blame them as time to retire.  However, the new owners are wonderfully pleasant and a pure pleasure to deal with. Now for the food.  Was there again yesterday, and--even tho I am not a prime rib fan--ordered the prime rib on the suggestion of one of the group who had it before.  Was I pleased with it?  OMG, the best!  I honestly thought this was the best prime rib I have ever had in my entire life.  Now I will become a prime rib fan--especially if it is made here. The food is plentiful here for a great prices if you wondered. And have been here quite a few times, and the service is always excellent.   However, this is not the Ritz, and the decor could use some upgrading--but you do have the planes to watch thru the windows here, the great prices and the good food, so it's pretty darn good for some place to grab a dinner. 4 stars for the great service, great food and pleasant people.  Just a little upgrading of decor and this place is a 5 star restaurant.  Try it for yourself and see....and if they have prime rib that day try it and see for yourself:  the best!

Wow, I had NO idea I wasn't the only uncomplaining person till I just looked at the bad reviews right now...plenty of p.o.'d people out there, Danny's. Well, I am stuck with about 8 tickets for free basic washes here, and when they are used up I am going to seek out another way to go than the local Danny's. Looks like when they got rid of the illegals that used to clean here, the business went down like crazy.  Used to get smiling faces and a clean, undamaged car back when I had it washed here but looks like that ended some time ago.  BIG COMPLAINT....altho the Manager said to come back and they would actually clean the car this time (I think I'm too disgusted to even come back in there right now...): I did learn one thing from having my car washed--and the windows, dashboard and interior not even touched--is don't call and file a complaint with the Manager, Roger.  I NEVER complain, but there were fingerprint smudge marks on the windshield--which should be a basic to clean--when I came in and when I drove out of there!!!!  So, I called just to give the Manager a heads-up and maybe he should check the guy who cleaned my interior (he knew who he was right away), and this fool, Roger the Manager, tells me the guy that I spotted as the bad cleaner had a "huge following" and does such splendid work and had been with them a long time.  Does he really think I am going to believe this b.s.?  Who has a "following" as a guy who works on an assembly line at a carwash? PLUS, this is the only guy I EVER saw at Danny's who actually counted the bills I gave him as a tip when I handed them to him.  Nobody ever did that before, which tells me he just pretends to clean and collects tips all day....and Roger at Danny's lets him do it, obviously. The counter girl is nice and helpful, but she is working for a flim flam Manager and the cleaner out front with the "huge following" totally is uncaring and incompetent. Roger, I was in sales and sales management for 35 years.  Do you really think you can bullshit the Old Bullshitter?  I almost gagged on the phone with the crap you were trying to feed me.  Did you think because I am a Senior and a woman that I would buy that load? Really, really, really disgusted with Danny's--and it used to be my go-to place. Again, when I finally rid myself of the 8 or so tickets for a free basic wash I bought they will never see my face again unless there are some major changes there.  Sad to see you go, Danny's, but you really deserve it with this kind of service.

Not bad burger...nothing special but not bad. Had a shake which was okay, too. Prices are very good for what you get, and the help there is very willing to assist you with all your needs. For a decent burger or whatever you want on their menu--for a good price--this is the place to go if you live in this area or find yourself over here.

I have received service here that is so outstanding I am sooo sold on Lowe's! They are extremely customer service oriented, and if you buy a defective product from them they will actually make good on it by either fixing it or giving you another. I've never had this type of service from anywhere else really.  Customer of Lowe's for life, and I bought all my ceiling fans, Levelor blinds and so many thing from them.  Great store here!!!!

Overall, I like this gym.  I used to work out at basiclally a (men's gym, cause none of the gals were into it I guess) bodybuilding serious gym in Houston for a few years, and the equipment is basically the same. Lots of different equipment if that's your thang. I've never had a problem getting someone to help me with anything here, so I can't say they aren't friendly to me cause they have been.  They've gone out of their way for me more than once which I appreciate. I like this gym--and they have classes from yoga to Zumba to Silver Sneakers for the retired crowd--so I'm staying.  UPDATE:  Management needs to make certain that the Silver Sneakers aerobics teacher teaches a class that is age appropriate for that group, and not the super fast, super hard class we had today with a sub.  I got so irritated I walked out halfway thru...grrr.  However, I mentioned it to the front desk, they understood and apologized (I have never had a problem with the front desk folks).

Som Tom (papaya salad)...what can I say other than a HUGE disappointment.  Okay, so I have been in Thailand and do know what this papaya salad is really supposed to taste like, and I see absolutely no similarity between Line Thai's and the real thing.   I was so psyched to go here that I am bummed they haven't perfected this fantastic papaya salad.  It's almost like they got a papaya, sliced it thin in sticks (so far so good), threw some roasted peanuts on it and some vinegarette type sauce with some slices of red pepper....uh, not Kosher.  They need to work on this one. However, my friend loved his and has been here many times.  Nothing but compliments on his dish (whatever it was it had beef). Seeing as I have heard only good things about this place, I will give it a 2 star for how clean, how professional the service is and how quickly they bring out the food.  But my dish itself rates a big zero--sadly. I will come back here soon, try something else and see if that isn't alot better.  Maybe my other fav Thai thing:  Pad Thai.  If they screw that up...I'm done with Line Thai.

The good:  Great bartender and great service.  Cute place.  Ok food--but not great food for Greek-Italian. The bad:  Ironically, I am Greek and Italian, so have some expertise at this one.  The lasagna...really?  It is a bowl full of lasagna noodles, soggy with tons of cheese melted and some relatively bland marinara.  The avgolemono soup is basically chicken and rice with a filler added to stretch it.  Not much lemon flavor in it either.  I've had better...hell, I've made better.  And the tiramisu--which is made there--was great but where was the liquor flavor that tiramisu is supposed to be soaked in?  All in all, I probably would never go back--unless it was for some fantastic appetizers at really good prices we had there first.  Now that's why you go to this place:  the appetizers and the bar = excellent.  The dinner food rates a "meh" from me.  Sorry...but I'll give it a 4 star cause the bartender was so great and the appetizers were wonderful looking.

I've eaten here 3 times.  3 times I've given one of these places a shot, but today is the last time.  If you're into bland, no spices whatsoever, no taste whatsoever, prepared food, lots of preservatives in your prepared food...mmmmm, this be the place! Everything here is horrible except for the salad and an occasional soup.   Never again.  I'd rather wait till I get home than eat at this dull place.

I just adopted a kitty from here that was a stray, and I found the people working here could not be nicer, more helpful and friendly.  They will give you any information you need, and you will leave with a packetful of information about your kitty and raising it, free first visit to be checked, free second shot (kitty will already be neutered and spayed and have it's first shot), and suggestions about your kitty. These people care.  I would never hesitate to get an animal from them, and found the dogs' cages and cats' cages very clean and lacking much stink.  Love this place!

Cracker Barrel makes EVERYTHING from scratch.  I know this because my son got his University degree by working at two different ones, and he's a total foodie today. I can say I have never had a bad meal there, BUT when you go right after lunch and they have already run out of the daily special pot pies on a Wednesday--ok, I get that one--but they also ran out of the apple cobbler dessert which is not one of the specials....well, tsk, tsk,..bad planning. So, I am deleting one star for the running out of food.  This particular Cracker Barrel is located across from Westgate Mall, so I think that is why it is so popular.  Still and all, the Manager should know how much to order for the crowds he gets, and this has happened before when I went there with someone. People:  Not sure whether to thank you for eating all those fantastically delicious apple cobblers with ice cream for me (I don't need them and shouldn't be eating them anyway) or to be irritated that they run out all the time. However, the food at Cracker Barrel really is good in general.  Eat there!  But leave some apple cobbler for me!!!!

Kid worked here while in college, so here's the real story:  All food including salad dressing is homemade.  Probably so good as it gets for homemade food on the go. Can't think of anywhere else to go....go to the Barrel.

For 20 years I have said I hated sushi, but my hairdresser just turned me onto this place and OMG!  I love sushi now! Between 3-5 pm is Happy Hour, and the Hostess had the good sense to give me that menu when I showed up a couple minutes past 5 by myself.  So, figuring the portions would be small, I ordered the Crispy Calamari and the Teriyaki Tuna Roll or close to that name.  Two words:  deeeeee-lisious!   And were the portions small?  Not by a long shot.  I ate what I ordered and waddled home...OMG!  It was filling. I totally take back everything I have said about Japanese food for years.  It can be delicious if made right, and this place definitely makes it right. This place is a real winner!  Will I go back?  You can bet on that one.

WARNING:  If you go into La Piccola Cucina alone--with a coupon worth, say, $30--do NOT expect to get your fair value, because the owner will tell you that you are alone and not getting more than one meal.  Yeah, it happened to me.  I was stunned into silence and not in the mood to argue.  You win the battle but you lose the war, Mr. Owner. Food was well done, but cold.  Yes, I said cold.  Who puts a cold plate of food before you?  Obviously it had been heated but someone didn't get it to the table fast enough, so by the time it arrived it was not hot at all.  I said...at all.  But it was well made so I ate it so fast as I could as I wanted out of there.  Interesting that it was cold because there are only like 6 tables or so there and it wasn't full at all then. And I won't be returning because the coupon thing, frankly, just totally turned me off.  I have used a coupon for much more than one meal at tons of places and this is the ONLY one that just said you aren't getting more than one meal.  Always I get two dinners for my $30 and just pay whatever the difference is (say, the two meals cost $40 so I give them the extra $10 plus tax). This owner surely didn't have a problem asking me to pay the tax on my meal also--guess just making sure he gets every penny out of you he can I guess? This guy is just plain unethical and a rip-off, so decent food or not I'm not going back, I won't be giving him any good p.r. and I am really disgusted in his "ethics." Good luck to all of you that give them business, but it won't be me or anyone I know. (I just wonder how many people came in there at his required hour of after 5 pm and he did this to?) If every business owner pumping coupons out worked like this guy does I'd give him a pass, but he is the only one I've ever encountered like this.   Conclusion:  I am guessing that this place is just barely scraping by.  I will be curious to see if it's here by next year.  Why?  Cause nobody runs coupons and screws the customers so bad like this place does.  I'll give this place 2 stars for the quality of the food which is really pretty good--albiet cold in the middle of the meat-- (I didn't say fantastic...but good).  However, not cool treatment of customers rates a 2 star, sorry!

Never been to Chompie's before but heard so much about it from my son I had to take him when he got in town from L.A.  OMG..he was right!  The food--and the service--were A+. Had the Reuben cause it has been dog years since I had a real one, and it was a goodie, too.  The entire meal was so huge that I know I was waddling out the door when it was over They also have a really yummy bakery there, so we stopped and got some treats to go home with, too. This is not a cheap place to eat, tho, but you get so much it becomes 2 meals in one order.  I think I took half my Reuben home to eat later it was so big.   Overall, I'll go back.  Probably when I have a big eater with me.

Fresh, fresh, fresh...I had #53 (I think it was) that was some greenery shredded up with carrots and beef slices on top - delicious! I had to ask the waiter for help, because I didn't know the foods there.  Went with his recommendation and wasn't disappointed that's for sure! Going back for sure to Pholicious!  Good service, good food and super fresh. And, for those people who want to sit and talk, met a friend there and we sat and talked for almost 3 hours without anyone bothering us.  Loved it!

Our group of 10 members came for a breakfast meeting at Ronnie's.  Since I had called as they asked the day before, they had tables and chairs and set-ups all ready when we walked in at 9 a.m.  Great greeting for a group! We all loved this place!  The huge portions, the good food and the great service really made this event super--and the reasonable price for the food just topped it all off.  More than one person said to come back here when we meet again...and we will! We stayed for 2 hours, loved everything here and will definitely do a repeat in the near future!  Ronnie's Cafe is an excellent breakfast place for us! Our waitress handled the 10 of us with no problem it seemed, and her service was so appreciated.  She was quick, efficient and friendly.  No complaints here. Lots of parking out front and homey atmosphere--almost MIdwestern in it's way--which is  missing in so many places in Phoenix which seems to go for the modern, sterile look that is boring and uninteresting.  We loved the kitchy stuff for sale on their walls, frankly....crazy and we loved it.  We spent part of our time just reading the signs they have up for sale. By the way, try the omelettes--just the size alone will blow you away!

Can someone explain to me how Chipotle's stock has gone up when they serve such bland Mexican?  It's almost like the Ikea/white guy version of Mexican.  Ick, ick, ick. I love Baja Fresh soooo much more where the food is not only hot--mine being cold from here (not the meat, but the beans and rice were cold)--but so much tastier. Tried the chicken meat which was ok, but the steak...OMG...it's like someone poured hot sauce all over the steak and said proudly to themselves, "OK..now it's Mexican."  Not.   Never again.  I really hate the cold, bland food served here and am just scratching my head how anyone--other than those who have never had great Mexican--could even like it.  What give folks?  I just do not get it at all...and I mean at all. Back to Baja Fresh for me:  hot food, cooked just for me and good sauces not some Tabasco bottles sitting around.  This Chipolte chain sucks big time....ick.  OK, I tried it again yesterday.  This is my review:  If you love non-spiced, mediocre, fake Tex-Mex Mexican food this is your place.  It's edible I get that, but surely for $7 or so you can get better.  This is Phoenix after all! I heard a nice looking man in his early 60's talking to his wife and grandkids next to my table about how wonderful the food is "as usual."  Goes to show you that one man's trash is another man's treasure.  I think the food is about so bland as it comes myself.  But, then again, maybe his wife's cooking sucks--and from her size 4 size--it probably does, so Chipotle is wonderful compared to her cooking?  Only thing I could think of that would make an intelligent man rave about this bland mattress stuffing crap they try to pass off as Mexican.  ...and their darn stock is still going up.  I guess I just do not get it at all at this place.

I'm shocked at all these bad reviews, because we went the night of the Mayweather-Canelo fight and the food was good, the service was superior and they even had a Pick 'Em contest for the fight which I won first place of a $25 gift card!  (Secretly I gloated over picking who would win and when over all the men there.)  They called me like 3 days after the fight to tell me, so I guess they went thru all the sheets people turned in and then called.  It was a legitimate win anyway cause I know my boxing. Regardless, we had a waiter named Andy who looked like he had 4 tables assigned to him, and boy! did we have great service from him!  Left him a good tip for great service.  He was SO on the ball with everything we needed. By the way, they did pass out some samples of a stuffed mushroom for everyone, too. We ordered beers, of course, some queso and chips which was ok, and then some really good wings, and we are big wing people at my house so we kinda know our wings.  BWW had some good ones. This place is clean and cute, and the crowd was pretty decent too.  You never know how rough the crowd can be with boxing, but this was a nice looking decent crowd from the area alround here.  No problems at all, no fights, no scary people--just a nice, clean, decent crowd of family-type men and woman. We've gone to see another PPV fight at BWW in Tempe which is an older looking building but nice, also.   Maybe they have gotten the place more together since August, 2013, after these previous bad reviews, but I can honestly say we had fantastic service the night of the fight.  Boxing crowds can be rowdy, and they had the event so totally organized--even telling everyone at the door that they might have to sit strangers at your table if they got really crowded.  I have no idea how many others had a stranger at their table, but we had one guy put at our table to sit with us due to lack of seating and he was a peach of a guy.  We didn't care anyway cause we were there for the fight mainly and told them so. I wouldn't hesitate to go back to the BWW again for the next event.  Baseball is coming up, so I plan to use my $25 gift card at one of those PPV games.  This is a really clean, nice place so I really hope they have straightened out any kinks they had before...but it looks like they have to me if you go by the PPV event I attended.  We're going back for sure, cause it was a really enjoyable evening.  Update:  Again went there for the Pacquiao vs. Rios fight, and the service again was excellent.  A little bit slow getting things out of the kitchen but tolerable.   I can say that the wings--which I hate ordering anywhere cause half the time they aren't crispy and half-done--were cooked to perfection.  Even the person with me who graduated from the best culinary school in Chicago commented on how good they were.   I just don't get all the complaints during the week.  I wish the management would look into this before this place sinks, cause on fight nights the service is really super good.

Of all the Paradise Bakery outlets this one is sub-par, because every single time I am there it seems as if the staff is more interested in talking among themselves than serving customers. However, this morning I did buy their ham and cheese omelet which was salty with a cap S.  Why so much salt? And the ham is a very thin slice of processed ham cut into teeny slices  Really?  For $7?  I can do alot better at IHop or Denny's and--guess what--I will next time, Paradise Bakery in Peoria. Get your crap together and give better service, lay off any salt (my gosh, lots of people 55+ live around there, so do you really think they want alot of salt in their food?) and get a real slice of ham to cut up not some thin processed slice of ham meat or whatever it was. Big disappointment here! Oh, I left out the best part:  One of the older retired gents who is a regular there with his wife asked to read part of my paper, and asked me if I liked it there.  Seems they eat there regularly, so he wants people to like the place.  I told him about the salt, so he goes to the Manager and tells that person who stated they would be over.  Did they ever come over or even send anyone to inquire about the horrid meal?  Uh...no.   Again, get it together over there, Paradise!

My opinion about Culver's is meh.  Meat for the hamburger was, at least, real meat--but they make it thin.  Everything was fresh but their Butterburger to me was just fair.  I've had alot better for sure. Then I had a 2 scoop cone which is something I never ever do, so you would think I would have been in heaven.  Well, I wasn't.  Not a big fan of their "custard" style fake ice cream made, surely, from a powder. Not much flavor in the vanilla at all, and the cherry chocolate was flavored but the fake ice cream itself is not very good. Would I go back to Culver's ever?  Gawd, I hope not and only in a super starvation pinch would I eat there again.  Not a fan here.

The owner said she was too busy and pushed me off to her partner in the 2 chair salon.  Well, when I tried to get this gal back on the phone before Xmas--and left messages twice--I never even got a call back.  She did a mediocre job, charged way too much for her service of a cut and lowlights and now won't answer the phone?  But I hadn't been here long and didn't know where else to go...however, I found someone. No thanks, Salone Bellissima, you were not much help at all here.

I'm shocked at so many low ratings here.  Was I just hungry?  Well, I went back a 2nd time.  Nope...with the Whiz and the onions, I really, really love these sandwiches.  OK...I know I'm supposed to be on a diet now but what the heck.......sigh...they're good...fattening as hell.....but damned good.

For me, the food was way too spicy, but I managed to eat a huge dinner here anyway.  I am the only one at my table that must have felt that way--altho I said nothing to anyone--but, then again, maybe several others did, also, and just were to polite to complain.  Who knows?   The food appears clean, however, at the end of the meal a lone roach was walking thru the place on the floor.  Do I need to say more about New India Bazaar?  Think not. Will I go back?  Are you kidding?  No.  Just don't feel like sharing my meal with the cockroaches.  Disgusting!  Thank heaven I saw it at the end of the meal and not when I walked in. Say "hi" to the resident cockroach for me when you get there.......sigh.

Gyro:  Fresh tender meat--maybe not enough tzatzki--but just perfect really. Hummus:  Beautifully presented with picked beets, delicious and served with thin quarters of pita. Love these two items and would return again just for these.  My partner who ordered a kabob got gristle and fat. Too bad she didn't get what I had. And if you wondered, I think the guy who owns this place is from Jordan.

I have tried various things on the menu--and might I be the first to say get the quesidilla filled with carne asada and be prepared to eat something super delicious, huge and super filling--and I love everything here!  This is my go-to place for Mexican in this area.  Ramiro's is better to me than almost anywhere I've eaten which includes the old line Mexican places here in Phoenix that people brag about. Prices are cheap, the people taking your orders are always happy and super nice and the food...ahhhhhh, the food...is delicious! When I want to break my diet and go hog wild this Ramiros is my favorite place..oink!

I've eaten here so many times and never once gotten cold or bad tasting food, so I am really stymied at some of the reviews. Regardless, I usually get their carne asada quesadilla which is superb--but so huge that I have them cut it into 4 parts.  I eat this over a couple days!  And it is tasty and wonderful, too. If you go inside you can find fresh veggies in brine, lemon slices and other condiments usually eaten with Mexican food, but I have been using the drive thru lately as I am always in a hurry to get home. Love this place!  It is my favorite Mexican drive-thru in Phoenix, and I have eaten at another on 43rd Ave. and Bell which was just as good.  And never had much of a wait either. Counter help is friendly and helpful always, too.

Well, PetSmart doesn't have to worry about me shopping there ever again from now on.  Here's the story in a nutshell:  I was bringing some Hill's Science Diet canned cat food back, because my cats just don't like the taste.  I go in at 11:30 am today 2/12/15, they call the Manager--some 5'11" (guessing at his height), young guy (30's) who hasn't shaved his bushy beard or cut his hair in 6 months, fat in a slobby way white guy comes over.  He looks like he is unkempt, and I am frankly surprised PetSmart puts someone like that in a position as Manager...but I don't work there nor own any of their stock so could care less.  I just want a return credit.  Anyway, Mr. Manager  asks me if I bought it all at one time. OK...here is where the story just gets stupid, cause the cans are all the same, in the original 24 pack box all wrapped with the plastic they put around it opened only on the top to allow getting about 1-1/2 cans out (if you can imagine how big that hole is).  Taken aback I said to him tongue in cheek (cause it was getting humorous to me at this point), "Uh...isn't that indicative?" while pointing to the boxed canned kinda smiling (I mean, it was obvious to me that only the plastic at the top had broken into that flat of canned cat food).  Upon which his response to me was, "Well, you don't have to be rude, and if you want me to take these back you better be a little nicer to me."   You know, I am older and have been in many situations taking things back when it was absolutely necessary, and not once has anyone ever responded like that that I ever remember.  Is he touchy?  Or is he just a smartass fat guy who thinks he has a little power now?  Or is he just burnt out on working there?  Who knows?   Anyway, I told him to just give me my things back and I would donate it..and walked out....never to return to PetSmart again.   What can I say other than I felt he has alot to learn and was ridiculous in his actions and certainly nobody I ever want to deal with again. Maybe if Mr. Manager got a new haircut and a shave he would be in a more friendly customer service mood...ya think?  UPDATE:  After multiple emails to PetSmart Customer Service Department where their "great" idea was for me to call the store and voice my experience to the Manager...really?  This could be the guy who was such a jackass, so why do I want to talk to him again?  Customer Service headquarters doesn't read your emails or has no brains and caring for their customers, which doubly makes me glad I am not going there ever again.  Bye, bye, PetSmart!  Your service sucks bigtime!

OK, I went there for a very fixable bleeding ulcer caused by a med I was taking--but gushing blood upon admittance--and was rushed into emergency and then put on the ward just below the ICU, so I got stuck there for 3.5 days.  Fixable but scary. Since I was alone and I'm a talker anyway, I spoke to everyone who came in my solitary room--and I can tell you that in my experience everyone from Dr. to nurse to the cleaning staff was just friendly, warm, caring and just really lovely.   Nobody wants to be in a hospital sick, but if I have to be in a hospital I surely hope it will be as nice as the people who work at Arrowhead!  I was really impressed with the kind, caring staff...and even the food was good when they let me eat finally.

My friend turned me onto this shop.  I have stuck with it, because--if nothing else--the work is decent and they are clean, clean, clean.  I tried another shop close by that didn't have the cleanliness of The Nail Shop, and all I could envision is coming down with some fungal infection in my toes that cost me a mint to get rid of.  Cleanliness and decent work is all I ask, and I get that here.

The place is....uh...a dump in a crap looking area, but the prime rib dinner for $11+ is a spectacular dinner, well cooked, tasty and a huge piece of meat!  Good deal! I've eaten here a few times with my neighbors, never been disappointed in the food or the service...just this ain't duh Ritz location or buildingwise.   My friend eats breakfast here alot with her volunteer group.  I think they have some $2.50 eggs, toast, coffee, hash brown deal then.  She says it's good, and being the superior cook she is I believe her. For a good, cheap dinner well done and good service, too...try Royal Cafe. They have TONS of regulars so they must be doing something right.

I found Dr. Rick (Roybal) at Arora on yelp.com and gave him a try.  Talk about serendipity!  This guy is the BEST Chiropractor I've ever used! When I walked in there I was walking in severe pain from old auto accidents, stress and a multitude of sins I just let go until I got to the breaking point meaning I couldn't stand more than about 10 minutes at most and walking had become super painful and slow.  My hips were twisted again from an old motorcycle accident which throws off everything it seems, and--because of some previously painful and questionable work done by a Chiro in Illinois--I never went back to one when I came to Arizona. My regular Phoenix Physician wanted to send me to a Pain Management Dr. so he could what?  Mask the pain I guess which seemed awfully stupid to me, so I bit the bullet and started looking for a local Chiro here.  I'm so glad I did, too...and soooo glad I found Dr. Rick especially. Since my experiences with two other old time Chiros in llinois used old school techniques I went in there kinda scared:  you know what I mean with the twisting of the neck and the cracking and all.  I was always sure I was going to end up a paraplegic.  They were rough, their treatments didn't last all that long and they didn't suggest any after-care or exercises--just come see me again when you can't walk without pain.  Kinda discouraging really. Dr. Rick uses new techniques which I had never experienced before which are much more gentle (and a heckofalot less scary) but get the job done.  He will suggest exercises and after-care if needed.  He WILL take care of you because he really CARES about his patients (you can tell it), he loves his work (again, you can tell it) and he will listen carefully to what you tell him throughout your appointment and will answer any questions about your care that you have.   He's very professional, and seems to have absolutely no problem in educating his patients on what he is doing and why.  Frankly, I never had a Chiro do that before and I really appreciate it.  He even makes his cell phone number accessible and encourages you to call him with any questions you might have after you leave there...can you imagine that one? Very low rates and excellent service.  I cannot give any more stars to this Chiropractor, but, if I could, I would,  I am extremely happy with his work and am getting my friends to go to him, too.  He's making me well, and I'm so very grateful for his skill, knowledge and caring...thanks for enabling me to live sans pain, Dr. Rick!  And just as much, thank you for not charging me an arm and a leg for doing it!

Had always wanted to come to this Phoenix institution, so when I had the opportunity I went.  Older place but nice with some absolutely beautiful scenery if you sit in the right place on the patio. It got cold out there, and they put heat lamps on which really helped tremendously. Nice bartenders, too, but beware the drinks are somewhat pricey at $9 for a margarita which tasted like it came out of the Sauza bottled mix.   Had the $12 cheese platter which fed more than one of us as they give alot of cheese, crackers, nuts, dried cranberries on it.  That was a nice platter really. But, all in all, a nice place to go in Paradise Valley, and--when I find Mr. Adequate--we'll be going there as it's verrrrrry romantic in the evening as they turn very few lights on at the tables outside.  Muy romantico...kiss, kiss, kiss! As Ahnold says, "I'll be back."

I have a girlfriend who is a gambling devotee, so, knowing she would jump at the chance to eat a good meal, since she quit cooking and loves to gamble, I got her to go with me to Wandering Horse. First off, I have never been to Talking Stick before despite several meetings that I wanted to attend but couldn't for one reason or another.  So, this was my first visit to Talking Stick.Talking Stick was a nice surprise:  no smoke smell.  Love it! Architecturally it is quite beautiful, clean--even the ladies' room is super clean--and, since this was a weekday, there was no problem getting a close parking space to the elevator in the parking garage.  If you don't get into the garage you can also park in their huge parking lot. The food is a pretty decent quality, gobs of selections and it appears that everything is made there as I saw a guy making pizzas and another grilling steaks on some huge George Foreman looking-type grill. I had various treats like smoked salmon, steak, tri tip steak, raw shrimp fajitas and the carmel gelato with sea salt which is my favorite...yummo! You can eat so much as you want, you can drink so much as you want.  This is just a fat girls' dream I said pinching myself!!!  I love this place! So, I ate and ate and ate till I was stuffed, which made walking out of the place difficult since I've been on a diet and my stomach is pretty shrunk. But I was in heaven, anyway, even with a stomach ache. The service was great, and we had a small Asian gal offering to bring us drinks every time she came even within 5 feet of our table, so no complaints about the service.  She was really great, deserved a big tip and she got it when we left. The neat thing about eating here is that you can gamble a little if you want after gorging on their food--and we did.  We played the slots for a few hours, too, which was alot of fun especially since we both won. This was a really fun day!  Granted, I ate one 100 calorie dietary ice cream bar for dinner cause I was so stuffed from early lunch (and I even had to choke that down), but I sit here with memories of a really great meal and fun time at the slots. I am definitely going back here when I feel like pigging out on alot of good food again. For the $15+ for lunch, this place is a realllly great deal!!!  UPDATE:  Breakfast here, to me, was a big letdown considering the lunch buffet.  A few bucks cheaper and loads of wonderfulness down.   The lunch buffet is great...breakfast not so much.  Won't do it again.

Meat Lovers pizza:  They must use some sort of meat that is loaded with salt...wow!  Really bad.  Reallllly salty.  Never again. And I heard so many rave about Barro's...what happened?  Update: Ate there a second time and the pizza was okay--not great but good.  Ate there a third time last night and the pizza I had and my friend had was SOGGY!  Yes, soggy!  We are guessing they froze the cheese, used it while it was still frozen as there was such a rush of a crowd and it made the pizza literally drip--yes, you read that right--with a watery substance.  NEVER AGAIN...and this time I mean it...NEVER EVER AGAIN!!!!

I don't go to Mountainside Fitness for working out, but I do use their Chiropractor there for a long time.  Never have I walked in the door without the staff giving me a super friendly greeting and being extremely helpful.   The place is always super clean, too, with plenty of trainers around to help. I have a great impression of this place from what I've seen.

I LOVE this dumpy little place with it's scuzzy looking exterior...and, let's be honest, interior.  But the food and service--and how do they get that food out sooo fast I wonder?--is superb! I had 2 fish tacos, a carne asada quesidilla and the grilled onions with a grilled jalapeno just for kicks.  Was it good?  Fantastic is more the word! Tax, title and license (in other words, drive out) came to a tad more than $9! And I don't know if my stomach has shrunk or what, but I actually came home and rested in a recliner for 2 hours afterward I felt so stuffed.   And this is probably the kind of place where you could go in with no shoes, no shirt and still get serviced............................................but, I love this place!  I will be back to Tacos Atoyac when I am even remotely in the area.  Dis be duh place, dis be duh place, dis be duh place!

Cute little bar with some really good food and great waitresses.  This strikes me as the kind of bar maybe your parents would like alot: clean, good service, good food....oh wait! That's me, I'm a parent, and I say I like this place.  Nice, decent crowd. Yup, this is not the place for rowdy folks but just has the right amount of noise. Now, back to the food:  Fish tacos were good, a friend orders the same Cobb Salad each time and raves each time, the $6 burgers from 11am-5pm on weekends is really good-great meat. I like this place alot (can't you tell).

Really excellent AUTHENTIC Vietnamese run by a super friendly family.  The food was so fresh and pure I felt I was eating in their living room and not a restaurant, which is about the highest compliment I can give. Obviously, this place has caught on as it was Thursday dinner and people just kept coming in and coming in at this small, well decorated restaurant.  Seems they have tons of regulars eating there, too, after speaking with several people and seeing how many were greeted so warmly by the waiters. The food is fresh, authentic and delicious.  I had the shaken steak dinner and ordered calimari and spring roll appetizers.  Needless to say, this was just way too much food, and I ended up bringing some home.   My friend ordered fried rice with shrimp, and it was the best fried rice I have ever tasted.  Loved it! This is one of the best places I have ever eaten at on the West side, and definitely worth the trip.  The food is great, service is great, place is clean and cute...what's not to love?  My friend and I both said we want to return here...and soon.

I LOVE the food here and the prices, but the service isn't always the best...but some things, folks, I can ignore if the food is good enough and is IS here.  Always made perfectly!  Just check your order and you will be ok.

Had 2 free tickets as this was the locals night doing comedy, so they don't get paid and you don't get charged; however, we had 4 Stella Artois beers and the tab came to $29+ (includes gratuity), so those beers aren't cheap at $6 each.   Regardless, the locals were okay and did get some good laugh in; but the headliner was some Vegas fellow named Mikie Mack or somesuch who was worth the price of admission.  He was better than most comedians I have seen as headliners at comedy clubs for sure. If you don't mind pricey beer, this is definitely worth your night.  I will go again without a doubt.  I loved Stand Up Live myself--especially if they get great headliners like they had 8/30/2012.  (And being a comedy fan, I've seen lots of sucky headliners like Shirley Hemphill from an older tv show about a Black family.  She realllly sucked.  I think she's out of it now as she should be.)

Mike was there, so I felt I might just get a good meal.  Ordered the Mykonos Chicken dish (think Mykonos was spelled "Myconos"), which was delicious.  He scrimps big-time on the chicken, but the sauce of tomatoes, artichoke and so forth was plentiful and just dee-licious.  If it hadn't been too crude, I would have licked the plate! My friend ordered the lamb shank which she also liked. The thing I look for most in places like this is the Quality of the Meat!  This is the restaurant's most expensive item and if it's a low grade then you can question all the rest of the food.  Mike's isn't.   Will be back with my feed bag on here!  Mike's = damned good!  And not overpriced either.

Took 5 bids, and their price beat all.  Excellent price - Excellent service on my entire house's windows and sliding doors.  And when I had a problem with one of the sliding doors a couple months later the guy came out no problem.  Excellent customer service, too.  Great company!  OK, let me be more honest;  I had the flu over Xmas, but heard tax credits were to be had if you booked before the end of the year.  So, I druuuuug my ass out of bed, made calls and saw people (from a polite distance cause I'm not that much of a pig) and chose C&C.  Never regretted it and never looked back.

.Fell in love with Pad Thai in Thailand so I had to try it here.  Not bad.  Still not so good as a mere 23 hour flight away at a small restaurant in Chang Mai (northern Thailand), but pretty darn good here for sure. Also ordered a curry here, which I found really good for curry which I don't normally like at all.   Love this place and will be back.  Plus, were here after the Phoenix Art Museum movie and walking around looking at the art on a Sunday, so it's open to 9 pm at least.

5 of us scheduled a Mexican cooking class to learn how to make empanadas, tres leches, corn pudding, etc. (you pick 4-5 items) for a class that ran from 10 am till about 1 pm+ and then you eat it all up.  Mmmm, great food, too! We left at 2 pm, so the price for a 4 hour class is right at $45 each.  And, of course, she did provide us with the recipes to make it all. She is really good about giving detailed information when she is cooking the food--you do alot of chopping and cleaning in this class as you help make it--so be prepared to work.  I wouldn't wear the good stuff either there due to this. Bottom line:  The class was informative totally and enjoyable, worth the price of admission and she will do her best to make you participate and understand exactly what she and you are doing when you are doing it.  She is organized and and does care that you actually get what she is teaching well.  A big plus since I attended another class taught at another school where you didn't learn all that much specifically, and I felt I could just go watch someone cook anywhere.  I want specifics as in what type of lard to use, where to buy the products in the food and so forth.  I got it here. And since my goal was to learn from someone who really knew their stuff when it came to Mexican cuisine, I left feeling good about choosing this particular Chef and this particular school to attend for the class on the specific foods we chose for her to teach us.  Worth the time, worth the money. And, yes, we will be going back for another class in Fall from her.   (As an aside, all of us got a kick out of the chickens she has that roam her property clucking and pecking around.)

I found a very good Doctor who worked here at that time, but when I needed to get the Dr. on the phone you could never reach this physician or the assistant.  If you had an emergency you would be out of luck totally. Eventually, I received a letter from this practice that my physician was no longer with them.  It was such a cold letter that all I can assume is the physician quit or was fired.  I did hear from friends of that physician that the lack of assistance, lack of receiving messages and general problems there made this Doctor quit one day.  I guess even the Doctor I was using just had enough one day--and I totally understand that one considering my experience.  Regardless, I decided I could no longer tolerate not being able to reach the physician when I had a question and changed Doctors--and I am a healthy person that would only call in an emergency.  Here is where the fun begins: I called 3X to get my records sent over after I went to my new physician and signed the release.  Nothing came.  Then I went to the new physician about 6 months later since nothing had ever come (and luckily I hadn't gotten ill and needed them) and signed a new release so the physician could go over IN PERSON and pick up my records. Now, this would not be so bad except I spoke with the Supervisor of the Medical Records room myself on this third call I made to have my records sent, and she assured me they would be at my new physician's at the end of the next day.  Again, nothing came. Bottom line:  It was just about a whole YEAR before my records got to my new physician, and that was because she finally just went over to that office and picked them up personally.  How sad a situation is that one?  It was a first time for me to hear anything like that ever. This place is so disorganized and uncaring that I would never ever recommend anyone use this facility. You are a number there only.  You will not get your needs met.  You have been warned:  this is a sloppily run, uncaring Clinic!  NEVER AGAIN!

Pretty funky.....and you might give some thought to having a bodyguard if you go there, cause it ain't Saks Fifth Avenue. However, did pick up a white French style Corningware casserole in the larger size for $2-4 (forgot the exact price...let's just say it was cheap), so there are some goodies to be had there if you don't mind being one of the only ones with a full set of teeth walking around.

Both my kitties had dirty coats, so Pat came to our home and gave them a good cleaning.  The matted areas underneath were shaved, and the kitties came out clean as expected. She used the Furminator on both these long haired kitties which was so needed, too.   But the real reason we hired Pat is that we wanted this initial experience with bathing to be a gentle and nonfrightening one for both cats--and it seems it was.  We will not hesitate to use Pat again. Pat has a great deal of practical advice and knowledge in her when it comes to grooming your pet, so pick her brain if you wish as she is very generous with sharing the information she has. Thank you for the good job, Pat.  We will see you again here I am sure.

Sciatica or hip pain?  Ahn uses accupuncture and electrical stimulation at the same time on you.  Does it work?  OMG, does it ever!  At least, for me it surely did.   An old accident where I fell on my hip caused osteo-arthritis in a hip (wear and tear arthritis), so with the lack of the exercise I was used to do before the muscles just locked up and caused enormous pain--especially at night when I slept which caused me to, well, not sleep.  I would wake up 10 times a night!  I just got tired of it, and had been seeing Dr. Ahn on the Sonora Living Live show on tv for over a year so said why not? One thing that sold me on Ahn was he is not just an accupuncturist but, also, a medical physician with an MD degree from a very good school, so I figured he would have a better handle on what was wrong than the average. After the first visit I was about 80% better--with no sciatica pain which I had had for months--after the 2nd visit I felt just about there being pain free.  One more visit might just do it totally. Ahn says 3-5 visits is what you need,  Accupuncture works with 80% of the people, and I just took the chance...thank the gods, cause it worked for me. Now I can sleep the whole night thru and actually almost walk like a normal person again. I was in horrible pain when I walked in and am not in pain now.  What more can I say? This was a great investment!  However, they will readily tell you every body is different and some bodies this just does not work on at all (about 20%).

I reallly don't like the cheap meat that is made so thin that they serve.  I only experienced the hamburger, and that surely wasn't impressive by any means.  Meh....not so good.  Not going back.

Cheaper often--especially produce--than Walmart by far.  I love this store.  GREAT prices, friendly help = can't beat Winco!!!!  This is my regular grocery store since I found it.  Sorry, Walmart....  Caveat:  Bring cash or a debit card.  Ask if they take checks (I never carry them).  They do not take cards at all.  And you sack your own groceries, and they provide the sacks.  Worth it to me.

Good store, but not found alot yet.  Great cleanliness, and I totally agree about the pleasant employees (and that starts at the top, so I assume the manager here is a peach!).   Bought a few things, but still seeking that big item for less on my hunt.

Ammos is as good as it gets!  The place is clean and decorated very cute, but the real joy is in the more than decently priced food. For a  sandwich level place to eat, the presentation alone on the plates was surprising as our hummus, dolmas and other foods actually came decorated with edible tomato, cucumber, lemon, etc.  And everything here is uber fresh as we watched the making of the meal. The gyros was good, the tahini was good, and the pita breads (both Arabic and Greek style) were just superior! Loved, loved, loved this place!  This is our new go-to Middle Eastern dining place--and we are so happy we found it. They also have burgers and other American offers for those who aren't into the Middle Eastern foods, but I am and I am in love with Ammos!!!!!!

Normally, I go into these places and then look over the ho-hum menu and get something typical like a burger, but this place has a really exciting menu with all sorts of somewhat unusual food combos.  I'd like to keep coming back and trying them all, frankly, as some of them sounded really interesting. Had the chicken nachos--which certainly was loaded with diced chicken--and felt positively stuffed afterwards.  Granted, I could have boxed up half of it and brought it home but what fun is that?  I can't say it was the best nacho dish I ever had (let's face it, it's all the sloppy sour cream and cheese that makes it sooo fattening but good)...but it WAS filling.  Very.  You get ALOT for your money here of nutritious chicken anyway...good deal!  And not all that fattening since they don't heap on sour cream and cheese but alot of healthy chicken.  Good dish for dieters. Good happy hour menu which lasts from 4-8pm with $2.75 domestic beers on the menu. Good service here, by the way.  Nice people serving a tremendous crowd with a smile no less.  Can't beat that for an evening out.

For a large double cheese and mushroom pizza....best I have had in all of Phoenix so far!  Good amount of cheese and good crust.  BRAVO!!!!   And thanks for being so concerned with your customers as to if they like your food, Mr. Owner.  It's great, and you should last here a looooooooong time I would think.  I know we're coming back soon...very soon!!!  Ordered this a second time another week....my gosh, but his hand tossed pizza is a winner!  I am so glad he moved to this part of town...mmmmmm, goooooood-o!!!!!   Update:  Tried the Italian sausage sandwich....omg!  The rolls are delicious--great meal!  OK....I think I'm hooked on this place!!!  My next taste treat here is the meatball sandwich....must be heaven if it runs true to course on this place...yum!  Update:  I can't tell you exactly how many pizzas we've purchased from here now but about one a week.  Same excellent quality and taste every single time.  Thank you Universe for putting CheezHeadz in my neighborhood!!!  We just LOVE the pizzas here!!!!

I guess this place helps some people with their 10-15 minutes fixes, but to me it's too impersonal and not in depth enough each visit--and I don't like going back again and again and again when I KNOW what is wrong could be fixed in 2 longer visits as I've gone thru this same problem before one time.  I guess if you don't mind wasting the time and the money to drive back and forth this place is for you.  Plus, if you add up the cost of say 12 visits = $150 you could probably get yourself into shape cheaper with 2 longer visits somewhere else.   I just do not get the popularity of this outfit...shaking head....

Peanuts are free when you come in there, but the peanuts seemed very low quality and often had a sour taste (burnt? bad?).  No thanks. The fries were okay, and you get a ton of them.  Fry lovers should go here just for the fries alone, but I'm not a fry person myself. The hamburger was okay--nothing wonderful. The shake was okay only. Meh...I really have had better, so I don't think I'll be back. Can't figure out why people love this place so...just can't.  I don't get it myself.

I'm reading these great reviews and wondering if I'm crazy or are all the other reviewers?  I hated this dumpy little place...not that I haven't found 5 star fabulous places, but I found the food great at those 5 star dumpy little places, too. I didn't find that at Rito's. OK, so I take a friend after bragging that I Yelped the place and the reviews were great--and--as per her request--they had beer.  I knew that, because I looked at their menu shown on the internet. #1.  Not the same menu AT ALL.  You have a very, very small menu at this place.  They show the fancy, long menu--with beer on it--from the other location instead of the handwritten 6-7 item on paper you order from here.  Not fair at all! #2.  No beer at all here. #3.  Ordered a burrito which was filled with some chunks of meat and oodles and oodles of green chili sauce, so essentially you are eating a tortilla with lots of green chili sauce.  Ick. #4.  I must not be a New Mexico burrito kind of girl, cause the green chili sauce was just too darn hot for me.  Not my thang one bit. My friend got the enchilada which looked passable.  I was so disappointed in Rito's that I didn't even ask if it was ok. So, dear Yelpers, as you rave about this place, I give it a one star. HUGE disappointment.....your discerning taste, Yelpers, has let me down this time.

The night I was there they had a Thunderbird Management Alumni group there--along with some fantastic musicians!  Lots of fun listening to great music for FREE! We had the pistoune (spelling?) which is made of some really great cooked short ribs, and fries.  Very delicious, and the meat was good quality which the bartender said they smoke for 16 hours.  The tenderness of the meat shows it was cooked a long time as it just melts in your mouth. Love the homemade beer here, but I don't like super strong beers so my friend got the Pilsner and I got the Creme--and both of us loved what we got.  If I reordered I'd get the Pilsner next time as it was just a smidge better tasting, but both were wonderful. Love this clean, little place!  Nice bartender who was really helpful, and even brought our food to the table near the stage.   Would love to come back here, for sure.  This place is a winner! ...And I'm giving this place 5 stars just because I loved the cleanliness and cuteness of this brightly lit place with the best homemade brewery beer I've had so far in Phoenix.

I admit I'm spoiled from the shaken beef I order at Saigon Kitchen in Surprise which is A+, but the Grilled beef, marinated with ginger, lemongrass, shallot and garlic over it #78 which reads as if it would be superb....well, it just wasn't.  Overcooked and had the consistency of tough 2 day old beef, not fresh tasting at all...very disappointing.  You get a couple slices of tomato and cukes and some steamed rice patty with it, but I would never order this again there.   However, it was a cold day, the place was packed and everyone--and I mean everyone--was eating a form of their many varieties of pho.  So, I will give this place one more try and get the pho next time.   Maybe I ordered the wrong thing here (in which case, please take it off the menu), but it seems to be strictly a pho place...so pho next time it shall be.  It's cold out, so I'm sure I'll enjoy it...or hope I will. Their smoothie (I got the mocha cappaccino) is basically frozen ground ice with some liquid over it.  Not bad but no big deal. Not a big fan of their fresh spring rolls.  Not bad just nothing special. However, the food here is super cheap compared to other Vietnamese restaurants which seems to be a huge draw for most. As an asidum, the male who owns the place is very friendly and tries to make everyone feel very welcome.  No complaints with service at all. Oh, and the place is very clean and well decorated for what it is and the area it's in.

Chicken pot pie:  Meh.  Huge I give them that, but it is bland and you can hardly cut the breading on top.  I'd never order it again myself. A friend got the oddest Cobb salad I've ever seen made with black beans.  However, he seemed to enjoy it.  Just don't expect it to be made with items that normally are seen on this specialty salad. However, the other food looked good--and every portion seems pretty huge.  I'll give it another shot sometime down the road for sure. Service was good from the entire young staff of kids. If you are so inclined, you can sit on their little porch where a number of tables for 4 are set-up.  That could be fun some cool morning or evening sans bugs to do.  Update:  Went back with a group of friends, and had their Reuben sandwich which is pretty darn good!  Would definitely go back for that.   The downfall here is the service from what we experienced this visit.  I had iced tea, and no sugar.  Had to ask another waitress to bring some.  The gal drifted off to get the order from a group of 3 when we had 14 people waiting for a good half hour or more. Still and all, we could sit outside, and we all loved that since the weather was great. I like this place overall, and will go back again.  I am even upping them to 4 stars now!!!

I'd go back even tho I had the Bear, and really thought is was too sweet.  Next time I'm doing the build-your-own hotdog, but overall I like this concept.  Kinky, cute idea you won't find any place else. Don't think this is some cheap hot dog place as 2 gourmet dogs, 2 beers, one fried pickles and one corn dog appetizer with tip came up to $45.  The corn dog appetizer is HUGE, so the son took it to his girl's afterward to share.   The fried pickles were great to me, so I'd come back just for that being the big fried pickle fan that I am....and darn, if it isn't hard to find good ones and these are good! Very good!!! They have a wide variety of canned beers for $3 which was fun to choose.  I got something peachy which was decent. This is a cute place for a date I think, however, I saw people here with little kids and for $8.50 a dog not sure if I would take little ones here.  Another adult, tho, you bet. The food is good, the service was great, the concept is beyond clever considering this place is a little tiny room with a minimum of decor.  Someone who owns this place is mighty clever as a marketer.  I admire them anyway for their creativity if nothing else and taking a very simple product (hot dog) and spiffing them up, serve a few good sides, cans of beer (no glasses, no washing) and charge healthy prices = clever. This one is a "gonna return" to....I really liked it overall alot.

Nice place, but the food was just average to me with alot of fancy stuff in them.  However, to be fair, I would need to try some other dishes to give their food a really good trial.  Had the grits and eggs for Brunch.  It was ok...I mean it was grits and eggs, so you can't get too excited about it.  Did hear from tablemates who ordered other things from the Brunch menu (the salad is pretty similar to one Cowboy Ciao makes) and the brussel sprouts were delicious...and they looked it.  Service was good--and the servers were really nice, too, so we all were happy.  Nice place, nice area...worth a try for sure.  TIP:  Definitely look at their parking situation  on their website as there is little parking in the front of the place often.  Better to park in the back.

Really good speciality drink, great mac n' cheese in a variety of flavors and good homemade meatballs = $15.  Decent prices for sure....and great service.  I am coming back next time with a group of friends soon. Parking is on the east side of the restaurant so drive slowly when you get close to it--and look for the driveway.  I missed it, and went around the block two times but, now that I know it's there, it's easy to find. This is a great, new places to try.

I ate at another location on W. Bell last August, and I can attest to the fact that both places pizza tastes the same:  slightly sweet.  So, if a somewhat sweet tomato sauce isn't your thang stay away from Spinato's.  However, it doesn't bother me, and I did love the meat pizza and the spinach one.  Which one was best would be like Sophie's Choice for me as I loved them both. This location is very pretty compared to the other, but both are good.  I like Spinato's myself.  Good service, decent pizza. AND the server even asked us what type of crust we liked, so you can get thick crust or thin or medium--whatever--which I never had before.   We had a Black guy who said he was an ex-Marine, but I didn't catch his name (Brandon? Bradley?), but he was excellent so the group tipped super well to him. It was a gooooooo, and now I'm even fatter than I was this morning...LOL!  And I ate it all without a care about even one calorie...yeah, that good!

Large, well decorated in a basic modern theme and clean--I love the decor. The food was great with no complaints (Friday night fish), the price was right and the service was very good. Went a long time ago (sorry, but I forgot to write a Yelp review then) for a birthday party soon after they opened, but all my memories of this place are positive.

Wow...this is so much better than DQ or McDonalds or all the other places you can get fake ice cream!  Loved it. Vanilla seemed more runny and soft, and the chocolate should be called chocolate fudge as it is more like fudge than milk chocolate but both good.   I love this place, my thighs love this place, my mouth loves this place.

Been two occasions, and--despite many others having poor service--ours was great both times with very nice ladies.   We ordered the golden wings both times and they were awesome!  To me, the best wings I have ever had even!  Love them! Friend ordered some kind of sandwich which she said  was good, also. I love this place, and just wish they would get on the ball and get the people serving and cooking doing it right.  I would hate for Zipps at this location to close as I love this place.

I love the HONESTY of this guy!  Called him because the handle on my toilet broke.  He came in, fixed it, explained why he did it the way he did then went to the other bathroom and checked that toilet tank, too.  All ok there, so then we went to the kitchen where I inquired about a number of changes I want to make which he explained would cost me a fortune, so now I won't do them.  But he took the time to explain alot of different things including the price of putting a water softener on my house.  This guy charged me $88 for the trip which was fair for the NW Valley--and a whole lot cheaper than the big name company that came out here and gouged me once (never again!).   He is on-time, considerate, dependable.  Try Dave when you have a plumbing problem.  You won't be sorry.  I sure wasn't, and he is my go-to plumber now.

If I could give this place zero stars I would...AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE!  In all honesty, this place was the worst dining experience I have ever had in Phoenix....and I enjoyed this lovely experience for a bill of $45 for two basic meals.  Really!  The server tried to be nice and gave us tiny free desserts with hot tea, so we tipped him too well for the place. But the food--omg!  Horrible!  First of all, we ordered some stew type Middle Eastern food that was refrigerator freezing cold--and this was supposed to be a hot meal.  I am not kidding about that either:  the beans had a tiny bit of heat like it was microwaved maybe 15 seconds in the middle, and the rest was refrigerator cold as if they had been sitting in the fridge for a couple days. The rice was dry but ok, but it was supposed to be with lamb.  The lamb--which was in such teeny pieces and old as in 2-3 days old lamb--was mixed in.  I just hope it was lamb, but who could tell cause it was in such teeny pieces and appeared to have been cut off probably another's customer's plate who sent it back.  It was laughable if it wasn't so pathetic. The food is just horrible here. My friend suggested it, and I could tell she wanted to die she was so embarrassed since this ended up being a $45 bill for a 1 pm lunch meal. Look at the interior, too:  the curtains are nice, but the windows are just absolutely filthy and have never ever been cleaned which is not appealing at all for eating.  Heaven only knows what the kitchen must look like, and I don't want to see it either. This place is a total mess.  Unless you want freezing food in a filthy environment, I'd suggest you find another place to eat.
