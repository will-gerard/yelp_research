GAS.  Gas here is always typically around .20 cents cheaper then anywhere else. I drive a truck that gets about 12 miles to the gallon so my membership card is worth every penny. The money I spend on my member ship is typically saved the first two months of getting gas there.   Went the other day $1.69 a gallon for regular, they have some great deals on other stuff, but truthfully I don't shop there that often. I just don't buy that much stuff in bulk.   If you like cheap gas thou...go here. worth every penny.

Came here for a drug screen for a new job. Tried to call for 2 days to set up a time to come in. Time is money. Every time I tried to call the number listed the call would ring and then just disconnect. So due to the fact there is a time expiration on the drug screen. Came in to get it done. Show up, find out there is over an hour wait just to pee in a cup. Ask if there is any way I can just go because this whole procedure is going to take less the a minute to do. Ask to speak to a manager. David. Who is extremely rude and proceeds to tells I can either wait or leave. I explain I have been trying to call the location to set up a time were he basically tells me that there is nothing wrong with the phones he has been talking on them all day. But I have been here over 30 minutes now and have not heard the phone ring once. Overall the place is dirty. The wait is ridiculous especially for a basic drug screen and the staff is extremely rude. I highly suggest never ever coming here. I know I will never be back. Ever.

How bad does this place suck, let me count the ways...1 read my first review...2. via this update they shipped my test to the wrong lab...3. So basically they lost it, and considering its been 5 days, I am sure the specimen is probably no good by now...4. I had to go take another test...at a different testing facility because of it, thank 6lb baby Jesus is was somewhere else and not here. This place is a joke!!!! Oh...and I will be calling/emailing per the business manager response.   DO NOT GO.

Came in today, Buffett was clean but no one came to the table to take our plates until about 30 seconds before we left, they ran out of spinach. Had to ask for it, same with pizza. See staff just standing around...plus the ice cream machine froze up and wouldn't work...lost 1 star. Like this place because it's close to where I live and pretty inexpensive but in general they need to step up their game...it's only a Tuesday!

Okay when it come to salad bars Sweet Tomatoes by far tops the competition such as Soup or Salad or your run of the mill salad bar. I usually go here with a buddy or two for lunch about once a week what's really nice is if you sign up for their news letter, they send out coupons usually twice a month so someone is always eating in our group for free or 50% off.   And what is really nice is they have different specials every month at this place so you are always able to try new things.   The vegetables seem fresher here,  and maybe they use more organic veggies because they seem to have more taste too then at other salad bars, and they definitely have more of a selection then most places, so if your not a green freak about veggies and stuff they have a good mix of soups, baked potatoes, pizza and other such dishes to choose from.  The staff is really good here and this place is very clean and everyone does a great job in making sure you are getting everything you need. The only reason this place does not get 5 stars is the fact that I feel it is a bit pricey for a salad bar.

This place is like a typical sports bar slash restaurant, got a few pool tables and some games along with a Foosball table which makes this place pretty fun if you want a few drinks and some game play.   I have been here a few times thru out the years. It's basically been the same,  Food is good, bar service is ok, but it is kind of dirty and a bit dark, but definitely a cool little spot to kick it.

Second time here in as many months...I read my first review, and think...was I that drunk...OK. The 2 stars.  Foosball table, 4 pool tables, sports on TV's, and the food is descent. The missing 3 stars. Everything is dirty, this place needs a deep clean. All the tap beer tastes pretty old...change the kegs, or clean your lines.  Everything is really dirty, like you have flies...there was a fly in my pint of blue moon...gross!

I went into this location and had a coupon for a buy one foot long sub get the second one for 99 cents well my total ended up being $15.76, sounds a  bit high, well my preparer Hector "Clerk 21" did not how to use the register and called another employee to ring in my coupon, which they did not apply obviously since my bill was almost $16.00 and they were cursing and were rude and were complaining about how they did not have time to mess around because they had a party platter order they had to prepare. Very disappointing, maybe Subway should invest in better training or maybe higher wages to get better staff.

Staff is lazy and rude. RIP OFF, you can buy anything you need in this store online for a 1/3 of the price if you can wait for it. Or go to walmart for about 1/2 the price. Never will go back here again.

Service here tends to be slow. Can never seem to find someone to help me in the fish department, and then when I do, I have had tanks for 20 years so don't try to tell me what fish I can put with what fish, maybe their food!!!??? So leave me alone its my money and my fish.   This place is also overpriced. You can find EVERYTHING in this store online some where else cheaper. Really don't like to shop here unless I have to.   Pet novelty store at best.

Recently went back here for a special beer tasting and would have to say everything was a step up from the first time I was there except for the fact that it still smelled by fish.  don't know what they need to do to get rid of that smell but it would be a bit more pleasant if they did...might even get 5 stars!

I like this place. I like the 50's nostalgic feel to it. The food reminds me of stuff my mom use to make, this place is perfect if you are looking for all American home cooked type cuisine.   I love coming here, they are open 24 hours so weather it is lunch time, breakfast or dinner you can order what ever you want. Burgers for breakfast or Pancakes for dinner.  And the milkshakes here are to die for. Don't go to Sonic for a milkshake come here they can not be beat. The staff is always super friendly.   The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is the fact that it is a little grungy feeling. it's open 24 hours a day so I think they need to close and just give it a real deep clean...that and that the little Juke boxes on the tables never seem to be working properly.   But if you want good food with good service, this greasy spoon ain't so bad.

Always been wanting to go to this place, so a friend dragged me in here on a night I didn't feel like being out...but this place made everything seem alright.  The staff was friendly but a little slow at the bar to say the least, I ordered a couple of Long Island Ice Tea's which made everything warm and fuzzy. My date ordered a couple of appetizers, can't say I really care for deep fried pickles but the wings were delicious....but how can you fuck up wings. I would have to say that I would like to give this place another ty on the food end of things. But as far as Sports bars go, this place is pretty cool, TV's could be a little bit bigger but that is a matter of opinion. Plenty of stuff to do video games and pool to. Overall not a bad little joint.

I shop at Big Lots some times because truly their prices can not be beat on certain items, but every time I walk into this location I am waiting for a rat sized cockroach to come up to me and ask me for my wallet with a gang of vicious cockroach sized rats behind him or vice versa!  Regardless, this place always looks like a tornado has gone through it, the company as a whole is defiantly not E-verifying their employees because if you ask some one were something is if you get someone that actually speaks English it would be amazing, or just in general someone that would be helpful would be nice too.  I have never seen a manager there, and most of the time going through the check out can be a hassle, due to the fact that most of the people on the register look like they just recovered from smoking crack for five years are missing teeth and literally if they can not get the scanner to work, you are in for a long wait.   In any event like I said if you want cheap stuff and can deal with the tumbleweeds and dust balls blowing across the isle the venomous packs of cockroach rats and non English speaking staff then Big Lots is for you. On another note this is the best place to by cheap disposable holiday goods i.e. Halloween, Xmas crap!

I usually go elsewhere when I do laundry but as of late it seems any laundromat I go to seems to be on the fritz of despair.   I recently went to this location, they had 27 I repeat 27 machines that did not work, it was a mess, and the coin machine I repeat the coin machine was out of service...how the fuck am I suppose to do laundry without quarters.   Luckily I brought some with me and also had some on reserve in my car ashtray, but I am short just a few bucks for drying. So the girl behind the counter notifies me that she has change which I promptly hand her a 20 and say can I get like two dollars worth of change. she says she can not change out a 20 dollar bill.   I have had the worse luck at laundromats lately I swear between the dimwitted help and broken machines the only reason this place did not get a flaming bag of dog poo thrown against it's window is because it has a few classic arcade games inside...that probably are out of order too!!!

Top Notch. I went here with a friend, after a nice early evening of window shopping around the biltmore, looking at things that I would either never buy because they are hideous or just way over priced, but I must say the biltmore is so choice because it brings out the finest people... and oh how I love to people watch. So after a rough day of browsing. Enter stage right the Cheesecake factory.  I don't exactly remember what I got, but I do remember sitting at the bar. The beer was really really cold which is a huge plus for me, the food, whatever it was was delicious, and the service was excellent. I will say I had a great time, because some how the next day I ended up with a cheesecake factory pint glass in my freezer...and I know I didn't get this at the novelty station. :) In any event I am giving this place 5 stars! I would suggest going there if you can for good spirits good times and good food.

New menu. Been a while since i have been here, most of the time i was here I was getting wasted with some stripper from the Hi-liter down the road. And don't remember much except for kicking them out of my condo the next day...but now that I am old and have settled down with a girl...I decided to kill the old demons of fun at this place and decided to drag the new ball and chain here...because she was craving something sweet and nothing beats a fattening piece of cheesecake...so we went and you should go too.   The Skinny:   A couple of things...the menu got skinnier, to say the least there new menu is fantastic and I like the fact that they didn't destroy an entire rainforest to make it...the old ones I think use to have perfume sample cards come out. and magazine subscription cards...sometimes I would fall asleep just reading thru it...  I like the fact that the new menu has the old favorites but also some healthier options. The Skinny shrimp summer rolls...the skinny shrimp taco's and the skinny grilled salmon and at pretty affordable prices!!!  Everything was great and our server Dan was fantastic(rainbow)   We ended the night with the Adams Peanut Butter Fudge cheesecake and it was to die for as it should be.   Way to go CCF! 5 stars.

Ace is the place!!! Really it is, this location is very well managed, it is always clean and the staff is very helpful, this is probably one of the few stores I have been to in Phoenix believe it or not that has that home town "Cheers" type of atmosphere...I mean it's a hardware store come on!!!! But seriously being a guy, I could die in this store I mean it's a hardware store, I can build STUFF and give things MORE POWER...arh arh arh in my best TIM "the toolman" Allen impersination!!! Which is cool!!!!   Anyway, I have been to this location several times, and I am always happy with the staff, the service, and they always have everything I need, I mean everything, I have never had to go to any place else when I needed a household item.   Anyway I can't really tell you to much more about a hardware store, but this one is probably the best one I have been to in the valley. If you need something for your home or apartment this is the place to go.

In all seriousness, I have heard good things about this place from several people, I kind of walked in and was trying to think what the hell was the theme here, seriously if PETA ever went in here they would close this place down, with stuffed animals on the walls they would have a field day. I would say from start to finish I was thoroughly not impressed. I will honestly say that I will probably never go back to this location. It wasn't even that the food was just blah, but the fact that the staff seemed to ignore me, maybe I was under dressed for this establishment. I guess my money truly is no good here, because I honestly did not feel the staff gave two fucks about me the whole time I was there. Garbage. I grabbed a card on the way out from I believe was the hostess. Torri McFarland...you and your staff from the top down got work to do this place sucks!!!

Ok...so Sam's Cafe is probably one of my favorite lunch places to go in Phoenix, I would go alone just for the fresh made chips and salsa they bring to your table, the menu items here are quite unique and to say the least are good for the most part.  Every time I have been to this place they have never been that busy, but I will say there service is lacking, it seems that when ever I go there I get the dyslexic high school waiter who can't remember to bring me my refills I ask for or I get the recovering meth addict that hates life.  I usually end up getting the mushroom and spinach casadia which never disappoints, I like this places ambiance, the only reason it does not get 5 stars is because the service always seems to blow.

Zen 32 is by far one of the most recognized sushi bars in town, it is right in the heart of the Biltmore and not to far from Old Town Scottsdale, a straight shot down Camelback road. I recently visited this place the other night with a friend for some late night soup and fresh vegetables. The food is always good here, and well prepared the service is excellent always and the manager almost always come to visit your table to check up on you, the food is good and reasonably priced...but something is missing from this place for me to give it 5 stars...there happy hour is OK...but I feel it is about time the Owner Lenny maybe did a bit of remodeling to give it the WOW again. Otherwise one of the better sushi bars to go to in the valley!!!

Went to Zen for lunch today with a friend....waited at the hostess station for a server to seat us....no one came....finally the chef said we could sit anywhere...we sat down...waited ten minutes for a server to come to our table to just even bring us water and menus...never happened...we got up and left without ever seeing anyone. They only had about 10 customers on the patio and NO ONE inside but us....this was sad....we saw servers walking in and out and a few even made eye contact with us, but none approached us. Very sad....plus the place smelled like bad fish....this place has gone way down hill...sad! Worse service ever!!!!!

OK. So had a friend come back from a trip in Miami, which sucked for them, because they got mugged, anyways it was late, they were upset and hungry and I did not feel that drive thru was appropriate.  So I suggested sushi she suggested Zen...so I am at Zen...it was amazing it was like a totally different restaurant in the same dumpy location...my service was excellent. Thank you to Rich and Amethyst our two servers, did an excellent job, were very good and extremely friendly.   The food was again just kind of so so, but the service gave it that extra boost.

Taco Bell, Taco Bell, Taco hell how does your garden grow, with all the grease you serve in your food I just don't know!!  It seems taco bell through out my life goes through cycles of crapness to craptastic!    So like 20 years ago, it was like you ordered taco bell you would get grease tacos with some lettuce and something that resembled cheese.   Then like 10 years ago it was like "Yo Quiro Taco Bell" with that little annoying fucking Chihuahua which was OK Taco Bell was kind of hip and tasted craptastic, remember according to the movie Demolition Man with Sly all restaurants will eventually turn into Taco Bells...this thankfully will never happen.   And once again Taco Bell is now crapness food that is similar  to Filberto's only good if you are somewhat drunk and nothing else is open. I told myself I would never go here again after gas prices got up to around 4 bucks and I went in to order two chicken soft taco supremes, and it was like 6 bucks for just the two of them, and I was like are you fn kidding me? They said they had to raise their prices due to the rising cost of fuel.  This is right about the time they came out with their value menu of you can get a tortilla filled with baby poop for 79 cents campaign, I recently made the mistake of hitting the drive thru one hungry drunk night and  remembered why I vowed never to go there again.  My check was like 10 bucks for what I think were 4 soft tacos and a large drink, they could have been something someone puked into a tortilla with some lettuce and some bile for that matter, I was sick for two days...literally.   I will never go to this location again, except maybe to protest the poisoning of the people by a huge corporation...eat here at your own risk it could be your last meal.

Once again I went to this location with the same results...they totally screwed up my order, I got a grilled chicken stuffed burrito, this thing was literally all tortilla and nothing else folded and burned into what kind of resembled a burrito. Garbage seriously tastes better then anything at this location. I have lost all faith in Taco Bell. SERIOUSLY NEVER AGAIN!!!!!

This is my neck of the woods...I was waiting to get my haircut and had a bit of sinus congestion that needed some clearing up so I figured so good spicy Cajun food should do the trick.  I got the chicken and sausage gumbo with the side of Cole slaw and an ice cold beer. The food was great just as I expected, the place was not to busy for a Saturday afternoon, I was by myself so I moseyed on up to the bar to make my order.  The bartender slash waitress seemed a bit pre occupied and in general I was not super happy with my service but to say the least I am a fan.

So this place does the job, but lets just say it's customer service and pricing is a little skeptical and shady.  I had a lamp shade that I needed repaired, it is an old lamp shade from the 50's it is called a wedding cake shade. It comes in multiple tiers one on top of the other.   So I call down, and they tell me that they can fix anything, after i bring it in the lady at the front desk says that they can't fix it, and she has never even seen anything like it before and is flat out rude. Just as I am getting ready to leave a younger guy comes up and inquires about my problem, he explains that they need to take in the back to their fix it guy and see if he can fix it. We all proceed to go back and the man says he can fix it.   Estimate given $20.40. Should not exceed that I was told...I was told they would call me if it cost any more then that.    I say sounds good, they say it will take a week.  So a week later I come back in and sure enough the shade is fixed, now they never called me to say it was done...I just showed up. They get the shade and its almost as good as new. Now comes the problem..the lady again...extremely rude. And when she goes to hand me the receipt she ads another  $20 for labor, $6.00 for parts and .50 for tax. So the total comes out to $46.50 to fix a lamp shade...apparently all they did was weld a few pieces of metal...no parts I can see..., says right on the receipt welded at seem, that cost about $1 in solder and maybe 20 minutes worth of labor.    I felt ripped off by this lady. Per other reviews she was rude and I feel like they have some pretty shady business practices, I can't knock the work...but I would never go back here if I can find another place. I have added a photo of my receipt where she scribbled out the $20 and added the extra charges. Total Rip off. AVOID.

I have only been here one time but I will say that I am a fan of the food and the staff. This place is definitely a Phoenix original and I can only image on the photos on the wall are from it's glory days of Phoenix locals that made this place what it has been over the years. A great little pub to get good food & good service!  I would definitely go back.

Not impressed.   I went to go get my haircut in Town and Country over near the Biltmore and had some time before my barber showed up  and decided to get a bite to eat, so I wandered into Souper Salad to give it a try.  I ordered the buffet and some Ice tea. It was really terrible, the salad selections were lame, and look not so fresh, the glass didn't look clean nor did the dishes or silver ware.  My table was dirty my server Nico did not reach his server goals, I did not have my drink in 90 seconds or less.   The Baja tacos looked old an not at all fresh...definitely did not feel like I was on the beach as the sign said on the wall after sampling one.    Everything was bland except for the soup, and the pasta was OK and that is the only reason this place got more then one star. In general thought they needed to just rename this place to Soup...no salad!!!!

Bowling+ Alcohol+Rock and Roll+ Cool Lights = Good Times..and low bowling scores!!!!   So AMF is OK..I have experienced better.  This location is your typical hometown bowling alley minus the line dancing or Karoke on Friday and Saturday nights...at least that's what my hometown bowling alley had.  Oh wait so does this AMF in the bar...speaking of the bar...most of the staff here sucks and for the majority are probably older then this bowling alley itself, the drinks suck for the most part...the only thing I have had here that tastes halfway decent is the Long Island Ice Tea...but even a blind monkey could not mess making one of these drinks it is virtually impossible.   Prices are OK, the Rock and Roll bowling is cool but I think it is about time this place maybe did a remodel, all the balls are quite old and most of them need a good refurbishing. Plus it is kind of dirty, but what can you expect for a Bowling Alley..just go and look at the mix of freaks on any league night.   NUFF SAID!!!:)  I am still searching for a "GOOD" bowling alley.

Once again....another vote for the half star system on Yelp, this place is more like a 4.5 star...and Yelp needs to incorporate a half star system so I can rank it the way it should be.  This place is 24 hours and with my schedule and insomnia it works out great for me. I have been going to Jerry's for a few years now..and as far as 24 hour places that are the perfect spot to grab a bite after a good night out on the town this is probably the best in the area to go in and chill at...I would say Jerry's has the rest of the close by place such as the 5-N-Diner on 16th St. and the two Denny's on Camelback and 16th and then the other one on 7th and Camelback beat by a mile!!  Jerry's by far kicks all their asses. The service at this place is always excellent, they always have fresh pot of coffee, and this place just got remodeled about 6 months ago and has that kind of homey Cracker Barrel feel to it.  The food is always good and they have an extensive menu of items to choose from, I would say some of my favorites are the Denver Omelet, along with any burger they have and their Southwest Turkey Sandwich is one of the best I have had anywhere!! I am not a big fan of Biscuits and Gravy but anytime I go here at least one person in my group has to order this, so it must be good.   The have a huge variety of cakes and pies for desert in a display case behind the counter, I usually go with their sinfully sweet carrot cake.   The booths are large and if your a bigger guy like me its always nice to be able to move around a bit and relax. I have come here to study read books for school and meet my friends and just kick back and relax.   The only reason this place did not get 5 stars is because it seems that it could be a bit cleaner, even with the new remodel, there always seems like there is some jam or smear of something on all the upholstery and they need to do a better job of wiping down their tables and seats.  But overall Jerry's is definitely a great place to go after the bar for a great meal and good service.

Went to Jerry's tonight for a late bite with a friend, got the Turkey club with some french fries and some Ice tea, and my friend got the sampler, we had the carrot cake for desert...this was a perfect meal, the service was excellent, the food was excellent, everything was good, and our whole bill came to just under 20 bucks. This location rules...totally a hidden gem in Phoenix...once again Jerry's shits on top of Village Inn, Denny's IHOP and any place of the like. END.

I have been coming to Jerry's for over 6 years. The food is always great, but there service has gone down hill. There use to be a waitress there named Laura she use to work late nights, since she has left every time I have been there the service has been atrocious. I went to night, was tiold I could not sit in my section I wanted to, I know from this point on it was going to be trouble, so as I sat down I already knew what I wanted. So when she came to ask us for drinks I told her what I wanted to order.  She took the order, and the food was done fast, it did not have the extra cheese on it, i ordered, I got everything but the sink omelet. And the whole time I ate my food this women NEVER came back tot the table once to check on us or refill our drinks. In fact we had to ask her to come by to get the check. Worse service I have ever had in the 6 years of visiting this place. This place lost a good waitress when Laura left. Food is still good but the service is garbage as far as I am concerned!!! Definitely hurts your dining experience when the service of a place you like goes way down hill!

Laura the best waitress in the valley is back at Jerry's she is there every night but Sunday and Monday. This place rocks again. The best late night place to go, great food, and with Laura back the best service around, as far as I am concerned every waitress in the world should go and watch her work you could definitely learn a few things.  If I were to open my own restaurant this women would be running the show. To the owners and management of Jerry's you better take care of this lady.

Love this place. What can I say and it is not because of the fact that I can walk to it. Now granted the only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because of the fact that it desperately needs a remodel.   The food is excellent and the service is seriously so good, you almost want to tuck one of your little Asian servers in your pocket and take them home with you and make them an indentured servant of some sort or slave.  But on a serious note, this is one of those hidden little gems you almost don't want to yelp about due to the fact that you don't want a ton of people to find about it and ruin it.

So...this place is listed as a tobacco shop...but they barely sell any tobacco products, I would say its a head shop, but it's more of a novelty store. They have a bunch of stoner and party products you can buy in here. Like novelty t-shirts and stripper gear. But the problem is everything is way way overpriced, if you can wait you can buy almost everything in this store 30% to 50% cheaper online.  Or if you just drive around to the west-side most actual tobacco shops will have what you need at a better price. I would also have to say they have some strange business practices, depending on what you buy they want you to fill out your name and information, also weird policy when it comes to using a debit or credit cards.  The staff definitely fits the store, friendly and informative but I feel that some of them seem a bit condescending when they talk to you like their experts about everything...kid I was smoking and using half the items in here before you were born you don't know ish about shit. Or at least as much as I do...your trying to hard...god damn youth of America...piss me off sometimes.  Parking lot is kind of small and its right on Indian School so definitely no discretion here.  Anyways good for a quick fix, and open pretty late...but if your looking to save money...you can do better.

Since my first review several months ago...this place has not gotten any better, and the service issues have insured that I will not be back.  I have been back here I think 3 times since then, and its still the same, the SERVICE BLOWS. Out of those 3 times, only once was the service half way descent.   The staff seems overwhelmed and under motivated, like they are not happy to be there, you have to literally go out of your way to track down a server if you need a drink refill which is pretty sad considering most things on the menu have some sort of spice to them.   The only reason this place gets a review or any stars is because the only saving grace is the Chips and Salsa are pretty damn good, but even this last time the salsa seemed a bit watered down.   The rest of the food is just OK, and I have tried several items. It's good but nothing to write home about, I think the poor service just ruins it. I went in the other night and asked to sit in the back section past the bar area since I had never been seated back there before. The girl told me it was already closed for the evening but as we were seated, I noticed that there were  no less then 4 tables in that area being sat at, and 1 large party. So this miffed me right off the bat, everything else was down hill from here.   Next time I  am craving Mexican food I am more apt to go to Julioberto's down the street and get it to go then sit in this place and get treated like a second class citizen by the staff. Hey Owner...here's a clue, have a manager on the floor, walking around helping out and meeting your customers before you lose them all.

So...this is the spot in the valley if you are a serious Foosball player....pool is gay. It's got a ton of  pool tables but what I liked is that it has 4 Foosball tables and these are 4 tornado tournament Foosball tables which are the best tables 2 play on, it is a dollar a game and is the home of the Arizona Foosball league. The staff is really friendly and very helpful and the bar is clean and has plenty of flat screen TV's with pretty much any sport you want. I enjoyed this place thoroughly.

OK, so I went back to Clicks for a second time to hopefully get in on some Foosball action, the first time I was there it was in the middle of the afternoon, so i had some time to explore it, and was pretty much the only person there, this time it was a Sunday night, the bar only had about 12 people in it, kind of surprising considering it is a pool hall with sport bar theme, on a football night I was surprised it was as dead as it was. The drinks were over priced for a sports bar, I mean Fox Sports Grill shits all over this place, so to charge 8 bucks for a vodka, soda water, with a splash a cran for my date was I thought ridiculous. The beers I ordered tasted a bit warm and did not really help my vote.. The service was poor, the Native American behind the bar bartending and the waitress seemed like she hated all white people and was mad at me because some one in my linage fought with General Custard or something. Anyways to say the least this experience was quite poor from what I expected, I am going to give this place another shot cause I still have not hit it on a Friday or Saturday, but up to now I am a bit disappointed.

This location was a joke...me and my girlfriend went here while we were waiting for her cars oil to be changed at the brake Masters down the street. You stand in line like at a cafeteria and the people behind the counter dishing out your not so fresh food can barely speak English, the tray I picked up was sticky and dirty and had some type of half dried syrup on it and it was disgusting.  They served us and did not even give us silverware, or chopsticks to eat with, and the general decor of this restaurant looks like a ghetto Chinese buffet in crack central.  The floors and restaurant in general were D.I.R.T.Y. like Christina Aguilara dirty back in the day before she was a mom!!!! The food tasted like it had been sitting in a pan for 3 hours, and I would NEVER go to this place again, I was surprised I didn't find a finger or a needle or a cockroach in my plate of mushroom chicken with vegetables.

Ok, So I have lived here for almost a year...and am not renewing my lease for what I pay here I could get a nice house or town-home in the same area. I liked the area though and did not realize all the problems I would have upon moving in. My Sales Associate lied to me. I asked pretty specific questions upon moving in.  Upon moving in...I was told my Apartment was going to be a 3 bedroom on the third floor with new carpet...and paint...well when it came time to move in the apartment I was suppose to get was not ready, I had no choice because I had already vacated my last place...so they put me in another apartment, with stained carpet, shitty paint and tile and it still had furniture in it from the last tenant...and stuff in the drawers and cabinets...it had not even been cleaned and it was on the 2nd floor.  How much is the average electric bill I asked...they said no more then $200 in summer...mine has been closer to $300...nearly twice as much as what I was paying before I moved here for the same size unit.   I asked how sound proof are the walls, am I going to be able to hear my neighbors...I live on the middle floor. They said I wouldn't it is a quiet complex, LIE...first night the people above me sounded like they were having a zumba class.  If you fart to loud your neighbors will probably complain...and the office will give you a ten day notice for farting to loud.  They failed to mention that the pet rent was a monthly charge not a one time fee. And this place is definitely not pet friendly, if you own a dog, and if that dog barks, don't live here...they will try to evict you every week for that one.    You will get notices for everything.  They also did not explain that I would have to pay for water every month, which took them three months just to mail it to me. So your rent changes every month...it is never the same amount. Um...you pay the landlord the water bill not the water company...sound fishy!  This place sucks on all levels, the pictures do not do it justice, the apartments are old, the kitchen cabinets are 1990's, the fountain and grass are all gone, filled in with rocks and dirt. They landscaping sucks. Pool is ghetto, You can only get sun before 4pm otherwise it is blocked out by the buildings. And it is small, it is usually hoarded by fat people and screaming kids. And if anything breaks...it will take maintenance months to fix...because they never show up on time.   The management office is a joke, no one is there to help you, they look at you like your a problem, I live in the biggest apartment they have and pay the most rent and pay on time...you think they would try to take care of a tenant like me...instead I get harassed.  Worst Apartment complex ever.  Do not move in here. Move anywhere but here.

I am not typically a fan of fast food, but, I recently started a diet and figured what's one last guilty pleasure. So I drove thru the drive thru, the staff was friendly my order showed up on the screen and was accurate, I got a big mac and an order of nuggets..the classic mcdees food.  The first window guy took my card ran it gave me my receipt and told me to please drive a head. The second window the guy re-read my order. He asked me how many sauces I wanted for my nuggets and said it will be just a moment.  A moment later my food was done, I went home, everything was warm and pretty good, I may not know what's in the food I am eating but at least it satisfied my last guilty pleasure cant say I will be back any time soon, but it worked for my fast food fix.

So I am torn between this place and staples...personally I think all their stuff is overpriced compared to Walmart, and if you want copy and print services I feel that the 24 hour Kinko's down the street shits all over them. But overall this place does have a pretty large selection of office supplies, but plan on spending at least 30% more then you would any where else, the only reason I like to go here is because I buy a ton of stuff and the rewards program basically gives me free money but i have to wonder if I am just getting back what I pay them already in inflated pricing...I was originally going to give this place 3 stars but after further thought...this place only deserves two. I can never find a staff member here to help me, and in general the staff seems to walk around like they are zombies. Go to walmart. You'll save.

Bruschetta and a bottle of wine on Tuesday for $20. For Realz!!!!  This deal can't be beat. This place is cool. It's in a trendy part of Acadia. Your always in for some juicy upper middle class gossip here, the crowd is 80% yuppie hipster.   It is hard to differentiate between the staff and the customers, but that is kind of Postino's thing. I haven't had the best service here always, I don't fit in. I'm one of those old school hip hop guys so when I come in here, I feel I kind of stick out but it seriously is a good wine bar, and good wine bars are hard to come by.   I do enjoy people watching thou, and this place is definitely good for that, it's good for dates, you are sure to see allot of first daters and couples without kids here that have been together for ever just staring at their food not talking...awkward!!!!  The ambiance is always good the lighting is just right. You can smell the love in the air... then again maybe that is the bruschetta...I love the Bruschetta...only place with better Bruschetta might be North...also in Arcadia...BRUSCHETTA WARS!!!  Sometimes they have live music here. Always a plus...love live music, I wished more places did this.   Anyhow besides the snooty staff, this place is pretty cool.   I'd give it five stars if I looked like I walked out of a JCrew catalog or if  had the latest thrift store Macklemore look going on, maybe I could relate better to the staff...but I grew out of that trendy shit in like 2004. I look like I came from the gym when I come here...and I just assume the staff assumes I have no money and give me attitude.   I just don't care. But still a good time.

As far as Dry Cleaners go, this is about as VIP as you can get.   What I really like is they have an overnight drop off, you can go in and they will give you your own laundry bag for overnight drop off service, they give you a code and you can deposit your laundry after hours and know that by 5pm the next day your clothes will be clean, and they have a good system, they do an excellent job cleaning all your shirts, pants, ties and other laundry and will call you regarding any tough stains or repairs that need to be made, they have it noted in my account to just automatically fix anything up to $20.   The service is always friendly and prompt.  Prices are pretty good, Figure around $3 an item. And often times they will have coupons or discounts available.   The only drawbacks I see is that the parking lot is always full due to the other surrounding businesses. But typically your in and out. And it was kind of disappointing that they removed the Belly App. I have tried other surrounding cleaners on Indian School and this one is by far the best. I have had bad experiences other places with lost or damaged stuff...that will not happen here, I will not go anywhere else.

So you put on a few pounds over the holidays or just in general you need a button sewed back on to your favorite pair of jeans. Well this place will do it, I bring almost all my tailoring here, they have turned long sleeve shirts into short sleeve shirts and no one is the wiser, and they have fixed everything I have ever brought them the first time.   There has never been a need for further alterations. Over all this place rocks I have been there maybe a half a dozen times in two years to get some things done and they still always remember me. The staff is really friendly and they can get stuff done in a really short amount of time, same day sometimes. All around pretty good, and their prices are competitive compared to other tailors through out the valley.

OK, So I usually have nothing but great things to say about this place...but as of recently and after reading a few reviews. I was shocked at what happened to me today when I dropped off one of my favorite long sleeve shirts to be tailored into a summer short sleeve shirt...I have done this before and it has always been around ten bucks. I mean they are just cutting off the sleeves for crying out loud and stitching it up neat like.   So normally there is a girl their that has been extremely helpful, and  polite and Sylvia the owner is never around, but the last two times I have been there, Sylvia has been in the shop and as far as the other reviews go...IT IS TRUE, she does not have enough staff to help her out when she is there and often times you will find your self in the shuffle of several different people waiting for one thing or another...highly unprofessional!!  And as far as pricing as I noted above usually 10 bucks for the change in my shirts...she charged me twice that today....  To say the least...I feel she needs to retire and put someone else in charge...she has lost a step or two I think. And this store seems much better managed when she is not around, every time she is there the store seems to be in udder chaos and all the customers and staff seems to be disgruntled...I think this is due to the trickle from the top down, the staff seems to be fine...I blame ownership on this one!!!!!!

WOW. To say the least. I love using Yelp. I think it is a great tool for people to use to inform others about their experience with a certain business or service.  I also feel it should be utilized by the owners of these businesses to improve their business, based on customers reviews on Yelp.  This did not happen at Danese Creations.  In fact in this case I felt like I was being confronted and accosted by Sylvia the owner of Danese Creations.  The last time I was in the store she approached me about my poor review on Yelp of how she treated me and how I thought there were problems in her business.   I don't think she ever read my first review.   I consider my second review of this business to be a hello, you have an unhappy customer based on your PERSONAL customer service as an owner, not your staff, about you and I have no complaints about your craft.   Being an owner I don't think you hear it from your staff or other customers so I am using Yelp as an outlet. AGAIN IN GENERAL THE CRAFTSMANSHIP IS EXCELLENT.   But for you to approach me in the manner you did for my second review of your location was uncalled for. And then to ask me to remove my review only enforces what my second review was saying.   You are a bit pushy and over the top, and I think that you could treat people a bit better. I appreciate your apology after we talked but the way you went about it I felt was wrong.   I can honestly say that I thought she was very unprofessional and I agree with the several other reviews that are on this page that have been left since I first Yelped this business.  The pricing is not posted and changes each time you go there even if you are getting the same alteration.  And Sylvia can at times be a bit of  for lack of a better word a snob!!!!  I am giving this place one more chance. I don't want to be accosted when I come into the store for any reason let alone my review of what I think your business needs or does not need on yelp.    If this can not be achieved I have no problem searching yelp for another tailoring business were I can be respected as a consumer.  I will say this about this business:  Excellent craftsmanship for any work I have given them.  A bit pricey, no posted costs anywhere, pricing seems to change depending on who is working.

If your looking for the best sliders and homemade shakes in Phoenix this is the place to go, if you are from the east coast and you love those little White Castle burgers then this is where you want to go to find the next best thing, along with there chili cheese fries. This place can not be beat. And if your a Chicago fan you will love it the whole place is decorated with Chi-town memorabilia.

OK...so I like to have my shirts pressed and cleaned for the all important work day or business meeting, so I use to go to Maroney Cleaners which is right across the street from Viking Cleaners but I switched to Viking after Maroney lost a shirt and two of my ties after being a faithful customer for several years, I just didn't feel like they new how to run their business after they lost my $100.00 Tommy Bahama shirt.  In any so I switched to Viking across the street and in any event Viking does a top notch job on cleaning the only problem is that they are extremely pricey, and not very honest, I dropped off 12 shirts and asked the girl how much they would cost to get laundered...not dry cleaned just laundered..the girl at the counter explained that it would cost about $2.50 a shirt but some of them would have to be dry cleaned based on the material, I said how much is that she said it was the same as being laundered, I said OK then, So 12 shirts at 2.50 a shirt $25.00 bucks...so I am like OK see you tomm. so I come in to pick up my shirts and the bill is $45.50...I ask the same girl who now has a huge hickey on the side of her neck...not very professional to say the least. She says oh well pants cost $5.00 to be pressed. I said I don't have any pants, she looks confused and then after reviewing my receipt she explains that two of my shirts need special cleaning and that cost extra and 5 of them had to needed to be dry cleaned which is $4.10 a shirt. to say the least I was peeved. And explained to them that I specifically asked the price when I left them to get cleaned...the girl was like I don't know who you talked to. I said it was you, which she denied ever saying that she quoted me the $2.50 price for dry cleaning which at this point I was furious and explained that I would never come back.  So they do a great job at cleaning but their staff is dishonest and unprofessional...Use at your own risk.

SO this is another request for a half star system on yelp or negative star on yelp for places like this.  OK...so I ordered pizza 11:28p.m. Told me it would be there in 35 minutes that equals 12:03a.m.  Actual delivery 12:38a.m.  AN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I got bone out Barbecue Wings and Apple Pies! I know not the healthiest food in the world but fuck I was hungry and there commercial came on. The unfortunate part about those two items is that they were both cold.  I know for a fact that if your pizza and order from Pizza Hut shows up 5 minutes after it promised time it is free. I asked for my free stuff from the manager on duty (GERALDO) aka deuschbag! He was like that is not a policy but I know it is in any event pizza hut is the most expensive pizza delivery place so I payed like $24.00 for cold food.  Did you know that the drivers only get .97 cents out of that $2.50 delivery fee...sucks for them I usually tip fat...this guy got my change!!!  This sucked I am going to see if I can get another place to deliver to me.!!

What can say...this place sucks..let me counts the ways.  Order was over 40 minutes late...waited one hour and 40 minutes...  Of course the food was cold when I got it, bread as hard as a rock. pasta was dry and crusty. Any experienced driver or staff member would of noticed this and re made it...says allot about what goes on in this store.   The driver got lost, seriously...hire someone that speaks ENGLISH and knows how to use a GPS.  The receipt said I was a new customer been ordering from here at least 7 years via my earlier reviews since 2008.   Took me a week to get a hold of the manager who would give me a credit for the shit service and the shit food. Used the credit for pick up, gave it to a homeless person...never eating here again.

So I want to be a fan of Burger King I really do..this use to be one of my favorite burger places growing up...it seems now when ever I go, I am just not happy. Let's start by my arrival, I got a good parking spot up front, it's in a unique type of building and parking lot so the entrance is almost facing the road...as I walked in I noticed there was no one behind the counter as I looked around, I see this women Maria(name tag) in the back talking to a couple with a baby at the back table, she shyly greats me and says hey...as she goes behind the counter she asks to take my order, not very friendly to say the least.   So I ordered the double whopper combo medium with cheese and bacon, I asked if could substitute my fries out for chicken fries and she says this is not possible, I would have to get the chicken fries as a separate order....so I do...total comes out to $12.30 seems like a lot for burger combo with just chicken fries...but it is what it is...fast food isn't even cheap anymore.   So the restaurant is pretty clean for the most part and besides the couple Maria was talking to no one else was in there.  Let's talk about my food, I got it for there, I always do this now, because I have given up on drive-thru's getting my order right, most of the time they fuck it up even if the screen is correct.  The burger...no taste at all...like eating some moist cardboard, the bacon was stiff and even thou I got a double whopper, they only put one slice of cheese on it. the tomato's used were a bit green, and were the top of the tomato by the stem, so it was like a tomato wheel with no center and in general it was not that good. The chicken  fries, were sitting on the counter when I placed my order, they were definitely old...they were a dark brown a sign that the fryer grease need to be changed and extremely chewy and not warm at all...I will never eat these again if this is what they are suppose to taste like. The french fries were the only thing that was good.  How can you fuck up fries thou...seriously. this place should get 1 and a half stars at best.  As I am finishing up I see the women Maria was talking motion to Maria and she motions back to go up to the counter after I had been there about 15 minutes, I saw no money exchanged but Maria provided this women with a pretty hefty tray of food. I did not see any money exchanged so I assume she gave it away...at least someone got hooked up here...as far as my food and service experience goes I didn't.

Went here last night with my girlfriend..lets just say probably one of the worst experiences with service I have ever had. So we got there around 9:30pm because we didn't want to deal with the crowds and we figured if it wasn't that busy we would be well taken care of...  We were wrong.  So we walked in and there was no one at the hostess station...so we stood there for a moment or two until the bartender saw us and came around the bar and seated us with everyone else...I for one am kind of particular about where I sit, I like my conversations to remain private and typically don't like to be seated around a lot of people but just by looking around you could tell the staff was busy trying to clean up for the night and everyone looked beat, I can only assume that the happy hour rush was bananas. And they had already proceeded to close off other areas of the restaurant. He did ask us if we wanted a booth or a table thou, and in all truth this gentleman was probably the best part of our service, he seated us. Told us about the specials. And was very polite then he mentioned that he was not a server but would get someone over to us right away...  So after several minutes our server came up...she looked beat...that or she had just taken some tranquilizers...  She didn't have two coasters for our drinks only one...she said she would be back shortly with our drink order an ice tea and a lemonade. 5 minutes later our drinks arrive. When she came back she didn't bring any bread...so we had to ask for it, she said it would be right out. 5 minutes later the bread comes out...it is barely warm, already hard and you can tell it was sitting out for a while...pretty much went down hill from here.   She never came by to check on us, it finally came to the point were I asked her to leave the pitcher of ice tea on the table because I got tired of waiting for her to come by for a refill. She never once checked on us in between service, of our appetizers we ordered the Coconut Shrimp and Stuffed Mushrooms nor did she tell us the food was oven hot, I burn my wrist on the edge of the stuffed mushroom dish. We got the entrees of Crab Linguini and Admirals Platter, we literally had to waive her down as she was going to other tables to get her attention.   Even when the end of our meal came we had to ask for a to go box and let her know that we were finished.  Being that I worked in the hospitality industry for almost 20 years I typically tip 20% or more if service is up to par...I didn't want to really tip her at all but I still gave her about $7 on my $40 check.   In general this place was dirty looking, dark, and the service was extremely poor. We wont be back. The only reason this place gets two stars was due to the exceptional bartender who originally seated us and the food was OK.

GameWorks should aptly be renamed to NothingWorks or possibly BrokeWorks.  These names would be more fitting.  So thru my work I got an opportunity to purchase almost $200 in game certificates like 1 hour free plays and 20% off your bill for like $24, so I hadn't been here in almost 15 years, I went a few times when I first moved to Arizona back in 2000 and lived in Tempe, then eventually when I realized that Arizona Mills is like the slums, I stopped going, back then Game Works was actually a cool spot to hang and play the latest games...not so much anymore.   No joke I want to say that 1 out of every 3 games there is either broke or does not work correctly, the staff is a laughable bunch of kids that are not much older then most of the brats that are running around this place, and you would be lucky to find one staff member if you were on fire and you need to know were a fire extinguisher was. All the trash was over flowing out of the garbage's. And the place is disgusting, nothing is cleaned they should pass out sanitizer with the game cards. I found half eaten food inside some of the games. It smelled bad, and everything is sticky.   I can imagine if you have kids and bring them here they would all get sick...it's because this place is the dirtiest shit hole I have ever been in. I have seen nightclubs after they turned the lights up on a Friday night that are cleaner then this place...puke included. And don't get me started on the Men's room. The smell alone is enough to gag a maggot. I will be throwing out the rest of my coupons, or giving them away to people I dislike.   This place should be called Joke Works. The jokes on you if you go here. AVOID.

Native  New Yorker in Tempe was OK, I had not been to this location in several years and was waiting for a friend that lives near this location.   I know they are famous for their wings but I was not in the mood for them today so I got their Club wrap with fries and a coke. Along with some fried mushrooms. The total was 15 bucks which I thought was a bit expensive for the little bit of food I got, and I could of got the same thing pretty much that was bigger at subway for 7 bucks. Plus that the coke tasted watered down.  Everything was served promptly and my service was good, the decor is cool definitely a good sports bar with TV's everywhere you look.  I will say that the food was OK, but afterwords my stomach hurt for several hours afterwords, the fries and mushrooms were really greasy so not sure if it was the grease or something else, but I would say that I would probably not eat here again if I had a choice.

Crab Puffs....by definition is my how I judge how really good a Chinese restaurant is. This place receives a one star on there Puffs. but receives 3 on the service the quality of the food and in general the interior cleanliness. I ordered the jalapeno chicken which was excellent...and the hot and sour soup which was OK... the staff was very friendly and we were greeted and seated promptly...they were a bit slow on the drinks, but made up for it by being quick on the refills. Have to say that this place is more like 3 and a half stars, but I will say I would definitely go back here for seconds.

Best Burgers in AZ...hands down...I have been to this place twice. And this is about the closest thing you can get to a small town restaurant in a big city.  The service is excellent the food is great and fresh and the prices are cheap.  They have this burger that they stuff with ingredients..like jalapeno's and cheese or whatever you want, the beef is fresh from the chophouse right next door...which is also right next to their bakery. 99 cent pie all day every day.  This place is great I definitely recommend going here if your a carnivore.

Two stars...for the location and that is about it. If someone with a half a brain would actually take the time to put some effort into this place it would be and actually could be alright...I feel like opening a hot dog stand right down the street, and would probably provide better service and food.  Thought this place would have a great view on the patio but no, the view is obstructed by  a fence and a wall. the chairs a re small and uncomfortable I think they were originally stolen from a child's play ground. In general it was dirty most of the tables were not clean and there were flies everywhere.  The staff was not only rude, but extremely slow, and it was not busy there. There were some dead people two tables away from us gumming their food ...now when I say dead I mean these people reminded me of the dead people from Michael Jackson's Thriller video...they all looked like they had one foot in the grave. For the most part there could of been maybe 7 people in the whole place. Not busy for a s slow as it was.  Plus this place is extremely overpriced. almost $20.00 bucks just for me and all I got was the burger and fries with some Ice tea.  I would say skip this place, pack a picnic and maybe go up to spend a quarter in the viewfinder for a 300 yard view of the lake another rip off...don't waste the quarter...I wouldn't even trust the vending machines outside this place. Find another place at the lake.

This place sucks, not my normal car wash, but was in a hurry and needed to wash my car. They did a horrible job for a $20.00 car wash. And I don't think anyone there spoke English. Everything in the shop was overpriced.  Had been here once before, and I could not remember why it had been so long...now I remember. RIP OFF!

I went to the location they have in Central Phoenix, as a court ordered referral for some trouble I had gotten into several months ago and truthfully this place is a joke. Hands down they could care less about the individual and are only interested in the mighty dollar, I would suggest that the state revokes the doctor's that work here license for the fact that their code of ethics are garbage. You truly are a number here. I would not suggest that anyone ever tries this place out. Go somewhere else...seriously!!! The only person in this whole place who was friendly was the receptionist.  I would give this place negative 1000 stars and pray that it gets struck by lightning it sucks so bad. I went back to the courts for another referral this place was so bad. I would rather sit in front of the judge in the central court system and deal with a wonderful additional date in court then be forced to participate in any out patient program this business has to offer, which I did so I could go some where else.  I would rather have hot metal spikes shoved in my urinary tract then go to this place. I hope this convinces you how much this place sucks.

Went to Zipps the other afternoon for some lunch, have eaten at this place before, and could not remember why it had been so long since I had eaten there again...  Oh yea, this is where most of the white trash southern redneck big truck driving cheap ass hillbillies hang out at plus the food always gives me a stomach ache because it is covered in grease.  Got the mushroom Swiss burger with fries...that were literally shimmering from the grease on them, and got the brownie skillet...for desert and could not believe this was 7 bucks was a total rip off of Organo's Baked Cookie. Our bill was over $33 bucks with only two Zipparita's a little high for bar food.  This place got 2 stars for these reasons alone.  1. It's Cheap 2. The service was excellent it had a ton of waitress so there was never a wait. 3. $3.00 happy hour Zipparitas  were good and were very strong.  Also this place is not an atmosphere for kids...so white trash muffin toppers please leave your 4 year old at home, instead of letting him mingle between tables while you slurp up giant mugs of beer with your tattooed roller derby girlfriend and her toothless hillbilly inbred that can only grow facial hair on certain parts of his face boyfriend.

Coach house is your favorite dive bar...this bar reminds me of almost every shit hole in the upper peninsula of Michigan. A great little spot to throw back a few beers after a rough day.  Drinks are cheap and the staff is friendly. Plenty of games to play and TV's to watch.  If you have never been I would definitely check it out.

First time at Frank & Lupes in old town Scottsdale, heard this place can make a mean margarita, but I did not see any being made tonight....to say the least I was sort of stuck here, due to some prick of a cop....but that's another story.  Walked into this place and it was quite busy, was actually quite surprised on how busy it was for 7pm on a Weds night. Lots of College football fans in their gear due to the game between the ducks and Auburn the day before, so I am assuming most of them were tourist.  There was no hostess, and after looking around I decided to mosey up to an empty stool at the bar, took the bartender/waiter a minute to see me, but once he did he was on top of things.   Got a Corona and my chip and salsa on, not a big fan of the authentic chips, and the salsa was a bit watery, I got an extra side of sour cream and guacamole, the guacamole was good, large chunks of avocado in it. Sour cream was your run of the mill, after looking over the unimpressive and hard to read lettering on the menu...due to poor design.  I decided after the chips maybe just to stick with what I had, so I got the nacho supreme with chicken. To say the least I was not impresses with any part of this dish except for the fact that it was huge...and the chicken was good...but there was not enough of it.   Total tab came to almost $25.00 for one beer and nacho supreme and a little extra sour cream and guacamole...RIP OFF!!!  Could of got better nacho's at Filberto's in Phoenix for way cheaper.  I would be willing to give this place another shot but to say the least I was not very impressed with it on this visit due to the lackluster food and high prices!

OK, so my cousin is the drummer for the band Pheed and they play here a few nights a week,  so I have been there to watch them play, I also have had a few business meeting here. The atmosphere is amazing with outdoor fire pit to cozy up to with some cold drinks, and the service is impeccable, the food is decent, and even though everything is quite pricey I think it is worth the trip, I wouldn't expect anything less form a top notch resort. They have a Starbucks right there so if you need the caffeine you got it on hand. They have valet, and the ambiance is very good, kind of rugged. Very nice.

The Village Tavern...the name alone reminds me of some hole in the wall bar. I had a friend that swore by this place, because she use to live by it, and we were actually going to go to Houston's but went the wrong way on Scottsdale ,so we ended up here.   It was the middle of the afternoon and after walking in I felt like i had entered a geriatrics ward, we were the only two people in the place besides the staff that was under 40.  My friend got the wraps which were so bad she could not even eat them, so our server removed them from our bill, I got the chicken club sandwich with pasta salad and iced tea.   Our service for the most part was pretty bad, we had like 5 different people come to our table when we were there, not a 100 percent on who our server actually was, but we would ask one person for a refill and they would say sure then someone else would come back with no drink refill.  Our table was a bit dirty when we sat down. in general this placed sucked, service was poor, the food was garbage, and in general even though this place is huge it truly is like a hole in the wall shit bar restaurant.

This place is your typical rip off place as far as I am concerned, I recently took my 2003 BMW Z4 3.0 convertible  in because my service engine light was on and my top was not working.   They had me come in before they even opened, which I was not happy having to wait for someone to get there and for them to open up. They treated me like crap, and when they called to tell me they had looked at everything and fixed my service engine light. It turned out to not be the case.  I got there and as they drove my car from the garage to me the service engine light popped back on, which they never truly fixed they just temporarily  fixed it, they said my sensor was bad but still charged me $34.67 to reset it, and less then a week went by before it came back on.   They also had the tech come out and talk to me about my top not working, he told me the motor for my top was shot, and would cost me close to $800.00 to replace.   After taking this to another repair shop, they deemed that the motor was fine just out of hydraulic fluid and would cost less then $50.00 to fix.   Really disappointed in this place. Complete joke and very unprofessional. I would give this place minus stars if Yelp would let me.

Just started working in this area, and first day the boss says, that he is going to be in late so you can wait a few hours to come, since I wanted to be early and was already in the area, and skipped breakfast to get there on time, I was starved and this place looked like a good breakfast spot. I was wrong.  It was a GREAT breakfast spot. Service was fast, polite, and the food was great. I got the make your own omelet with the potatoes and some coffee and tea. The coffee mugs are unique compared to any place I have ever been to, they are a clear glass mug. It was a bit different. Overall very very good. I just kind of relaxed and enjoyed my meal, no rush it was very good, and the portions were pretty hefty, you can never tell what your going to get at these smaller places. So I was pleasantly surprised. And my check was less then $15.00 so not to shabby for the portion sizes. And i almost forgot they give you this basket of these delicious little tiny muffins, these things are like biting into heaven. They were so good. Pretty sure they are complimentary.   This place has a real small town feel to it, you could tell allot of the people inside were regulars. Everybody seemed really friendly.   The only reason this place didn't get five stars, because the parking lot didn't really have a good parking set up to get in, I had to walk around the building across the porch which was kind of dirty and could use a coat of paint or protection, and I didn't see any handicap spots...if they were there the signs were not very visible. That and it could use a good thorough cleaning on the inside, lots of nick knacks and stuff up, they are all pretty dusty. Could use a good cleaning.   Over all thou, a real good experience I will be back for sure.

Been here a few times now...cant say I am impressed. Couple of reason's why... 1. Staff members sometimes don't speak very good English...if your going to put someone on drive thru, please have them know how to speak English.  2. The fresco menu isn't available till 11am...WTF? Why? 3. The parking lot and interior is always pretty dirty, dirty tables inside.  4. The food always seems smashed, like its smashed or is leaking out something, cheese, sauce etc. 5. they forget items, screw up the order. 6. All items aren't listed on the drive thru menu.   This place is close to my work and a healthier option then BK and MCd's down the street. But this place needs work...same shit every time I go here.

Really wanted a quick lunch with some soft shell chicken tacos...proceeding nightmare. 20 minute wait in drive thru, lunch break over. Thank you, yes I was late getting back to work. Truck in front of me...gets my order, order is manhandled by them, and at least 3 other people before I get it handed to me. Gross, food is ultimately squished. They are out of green sauce. I will never go back to this place. It is a joke, the staff sucks. Food generally looks like it was squeezed out of a baby's diaper and effectively probably tastes like it too. Always a wait. Complete joke. This place needs to close for the betterment of society.

Yay I am a fan...ok for the ladies...this is a tough bit, I have shopped here with girls who literally will hide good finds in other places of the store so they can come back and get them later, most of the time they are gone.   Funny huh, this place literally looks worse then some of the barrio shops in rocky point, it seems like it is the day after thanksgiving every day there, and people literally throw stuff anywhere.  For the guys this place is a pretty good place to go, the deals on shoes are unreal, nikes that are $100.00 bucks for like $20.00, you can't get that anywhere.   You can also get top notch clothing and make you look like a true Scottsdale deuschbag for less then 100 bucks Rolex or Tag Heur watches will not be found here, sorry deuschbaggery only goes so far at last chance.   In any event this is probably one of the best bargain basement places in the valley to get top notch stuff.    Two things you need to know about this place.  1. They restock every Sunday, so Sunday mornings here really are like every black Friday after thanksgiving, you might get trampled to death like that guy at Walmart or shot like those two dudes at Toy's R Us..and it could be your last chance:)  2. Check all your shit seriously, allot of this stuff is here because it is damaged, so be careful they have no return policy that is why it is LAST CHANCE!

I moved across the street from here...and I have to say that this place is now one of my favorite spots to go. The fact that they stay open late, and serve sushi to midnight is awesome. I can literally walk here...or stumble home from here. they have a great happy hour. The only thing is I wish their beer was a little less expensive. Otherwise a great spot, usually the service is always excellent and there is never to long of a wait.

I love this place, I am a frequent customer, I have a 10% off discount card. I would eat here everyday if I could afford it. I can walk here from home. NO DUI. Tara and the staff here rock. As good as it gets.

So I have lived in Phoenix for over 8 years, and several weeks ago, I finally went to Mexico for the first time, and actually tasted real Mexican food...so I now have a real taste for more AUTHENTIC Mexican food, so for 8 years I have driven by this building and this restaurant and wondered what was this two story building all about, since it is right on a corner of two streets you could never really see if it was busy or not, or see people going in or out of it, so finally me and a girlfriend went in to explore it. All I can say this is the most authentic Mexican food I have found in Phoenix and was very glad to have found it. The service was top notch, the waiter was very informative, and the ambiance was spectacular, the restaurant is set up with some very original decor.  I am the type of person that really likes peace and quiet and seclusion when I go out to eat, I enjoy dark lit venues, where I can enjoy private conversations with myself and my friends and at this place we were the only patrons the whole time we were there, and it was very peaceful. The waiter informed me that they have a guitar player that plays classical Mexican music, so I will be sure to go back there very soon to enjoy this. The food was terrific I had the soup which was delicious and a chicken Torta which was amazing, it was less then $40.00 for both of to enjoy our lunch and for this atmosphere with this food it was worth every penny. This place is now one of my all time favorite hideaways!!! Love it!!!

Took two girlfriends here who had never been here...everything was perfect. I got the Filet Mignon which is smothered in green and red peppers and onions and placed on a corn tortilla which is covered in cheese with fresh slices of avocado with a side of black beans and rice pilaf! While my friends had the new york strip steak and the some other 3 cheese entree. The food was all amazing the service was excellent. I finally got to see the Mariachi player play guitar and enjoyed the ambiance of this place very much...I almost didn't want to Yelp about this place...and wanted to keep it a secret...but I would rather that people go all carrot mob on this place so it stays in business. One of the best places I have been to eat in phoenix. Truly deserving of it's five stars rating.

Pink Taco...the name itself has you asking questions, of is this a restaurant or a brothel of some sort, when you walk in and see the decor, of the Mexican low rider bicycle on the wall, and the crosses, you are still wondering if it is a restaurant or a brothel for a bit...and wondering what any of this has to do with pink tacos!!!  So moving on, we were greeted by a friendly girl named Sara who just also happened to be our server. She did a fairly good job considering she seemed to have limited amount of stuff to work with, and we were there during happy hour....it was dead!   I was impressed by there happy hour prices, until I experienced some of their happy hour specials first hand, my friend got the nacho's, I personally could of made better nacho's at home, I mean these things really looked like they cost less then 5 dollars, the chips here are so salty I would need a gallon of water to eat the whole dish, the salsa seemed fairly good and fresh, and the shrimp tacos I had were not bad even though I did expect some larger portions for 13 bucks!  The drinks, back to Sara, so I asked her what they had on draft and she rattled off about 5 beers, none of which were really that impressive to me, so when I pick one out she comes back a bit later and says they are out, so I reluctantly get a margarita what my two friends were drinking that did not look that impressive. I also asked for a water, which took Sara two more requests before she brought it.  I was right, they were not that strong and for 5 bucks I would expect a bigger glass, these things were weak, and for five bucks, I was like come on, I thought this place was a bit pricey my tab was like 25 bucks for two margaritas, and three tiny shrimp tacos, and some bad table chips....that I was assuming where free, but maybe not considering my tab.   In any event I was not impressed with the Pink Taco...I can also say that this location seemed a bit dirty, our menus look like they had been wiped down with a dirty rag. I mean I guess I couldn't expect any better, I mean this place is better known for it's nightlife on a Friday or Saturday then its food. I would suggest someplace else I was not satisfied with the food, this maybe a great meat market at night for pink tacos, but the food sucks!!!

Shady's..sounds like most of the people who go there...which is me!!  I like Shady's the only reason this place does not get 5 stars is because there are a couple of bartenders that work here that really suck. I mean this place is never that busy, even though there is usually a pretty good crowd in here on any given night, but unless you have boobs or hang out at this place on a regular you pretty much get ignored, I go here probably at least once or twice a month with friends and it is the same every time.   What I like most about Shady's is I can literally stumble home through the hood on most nights of the week. Any time you don't have to drive home that is a plus.   Drinks are reasonably priced here.  They have a pool table.  They have a patio with smoking.  They have one of the coolest jukeboxes around with classic music on it, you can't find in most places.  Definitely your granola grunge mix of people here...your 80's Yuppy and early 90's children of Yuppy crowd is here if that's what you like!  I like Shady's I don't fit in here at all, but I like people watching and like the prices and that I can stumble home form here on any given night.

Delivery is good and fast...I have only been into this place to eat once, but have gotten delivery from there several times. Their food is kind of bland, but you get your moneys worth for sure, which mean the portions are large. I ordered the spicy orange chicken with the hot and sour soup and the crab puffs the last time I got delivery from here, the chicken was very dry and did not really taste that spicy, the soup was OK but then again not really all that spicy either and the crab puffs were filled with very little cream cheese and virtually no crab, plus that were very hard. This place is good for OK delivery and dine in food, defiantly not the best Chinese food in the valley. I would suggest it for a quick fix Chinese, basically taste like your typical Chinese buffet without the buffet.

So, this place delivers soup...and soup is good when your sick, and the portions are large, I also went ahead and got my regular crab puffs and orange chicken. Simply delicious a definite improvement since the last time I ordered. The chicken still could of been a little more juicy but for the most part I would say this place has improved on the quality of food since the last time I ate there. The crab puffs were fat filled with cream cheese the crab still seemed to be lacking a bit, but definitely better then before. The service was as good as it could of been for delivery. I would say more like 3.5 stars. But I am feeling frisky today so I am going to give it 4 stars.

Great. If you have never been I would highly suggest going. Has great pizza...another local spot that blows Pizzeria Bianco out of the water. This place is pretty packed on the weekends and you can expect to wait at least 30 minutes on any given day.  The service here is top notch and I have never had a bad meal. This is one of those places that you wish no one knew about because it is so good you want to keep it to yourself. Me yelping about it is not helping but they are so busy most times the secret's out...and if you don't know now ya know!!!!  5 stars!!!

Went back the other day, Got 2 pizzas. Still fantastic. This place seems a bit more touristy then it use to, back when I use to go it was more of a local hangout. Seems it is mainstream now, Postino's next door and the new business in the area are definitely attracting more people. Still a great spot to go for great food and atmosphere.

I give this place 4 and 1/2 stars YAY! I'm a fan.  This is probably the best car wash for $20.00 you can get in the state of Arizona.  They do a thorough job of washing your car and making sure it is really clean. I always tip just because they do such a good job.  I can not even image what it would be if  I got one of their detail packages.  For $20.00 they do like a $100.00 job at other places...they can not be beat for their value.  They have a nice clean waiting area, with plenty of reading materials and vending machines.   It is quick...convenient and cheap and everyone is really friendly, this place RULEZ!

So I don't know what happened to this place but the last two times I have been here, the service was really sub par and shady.   Last time I went and got my truck washed and detailed, even got the carpets cleaned and a waxing, they left product all thru out my Expedition. I had like a leather conditioning grease all over my clothes when I got out and the dash was smeared and the display was covered in smear...when I got home I had to go thru half the vehicle with a towel and clean up. I paid over $60 for this.   Really disappointing...and didn't go back, and had no plans to. But one day me and my gf went to 5 and Diner for breakfast down the street and decided to drop her car off to get it detailed, since we were going to be in the area for a moment. As we were pulling around to the car wash, some guy comes up trying to pitch window chip fix...and he was like it wont cost you anything and we can bill your insurance, I was like no...my gf was like reluctantly why not, if the insurance is going to cover it...called the insurance company, they wouldn't cover it. Huge waste of time, even worse when your hungry.   So we walk over to 5 and Diner to eat, and my GF realizes that she left her phone in the front of the Car in her center console, I call over there to speak to someone to see if they can go hold it for us. The guy says he looked in the car and it is not there. My GF freaks out and says "I am going back there right now"...we had already ordered food so I stayed, she said when she got back there she started looking thru the car, and couldn't find it, while some Mexican was cleaning the car I guess the manager comes up and asks if he can help her she explains her phone was in the car and now it is gone, he is like "Are you sure you left it in the car?" well apparently while they were talking it just magically appeared on the floor in the backseat. She had already looked there. It was not there before...they tried to steal it.  Will never go back here EVER.   Don't know what's happened over the last few years but this place is now a joke.

I buy my food here because it's healthy and I don't want to die from the Swine flu.   And in a more serious note. I love sprouts because they have a large selection and very competitive prices for healthy organic food.   Great place to observe hippie chicks, and dudes that smell like patchouli:)   No... the granola bins are great...love to get nuts by the pound...wait a minute that didn't come out quite the way I wanted it to...  Anyways, Healthy food, descent location good crowd, hippie staff. it's all good in my shopping cart!  Carrot mob strikes again!!!

So I go here allot, not going to review every time I go, but to say the least my experiences are always just OK. This time they lose a star due to the fact that, this place just seem to be getting worse every time I go.   First...its dirty, they could use a thorough cleaning. I mean its a movie theater, its generally gross. And it keeps getting dirtier, I feel at least once a month these things need to be cleaned  to the max. they are not.   Second...the food quality has gone down hill. I can only assume that the kitchen like the rest of the place is starting to get run down and since the theaters aren't clean, I can only assume the restaurant kitchen isn't either. And it's overpriced. To pay what you ask me to pay, $10 for shrimp that taste like it went bad, and $4.00 for a glass of ice tea. A little much...seriously $4.00 for tea. IT'S TEA.   Lastly for as much as they gouge you, the service sucks. Most of the time, you will press your little button and not see a server for 10 minutes, they are either understaffed, but most the time I am there I just see staff hanging on either end of the bar or standing around talking outside the theaters in the hallway.  And a final tip, try not to tuck the validater for the valet parking away until everyone leaves, so I don't feel like I am getting looked at like I am robbing the place when I have to go behind the ticket counter to get my parking verified.   Please step it up AMC. I do enjoy movies...which is truthfully the only reason this review got 2 stars...but not your business.

Been with Cox 6 years...Loyalty department my ass...they only show my current address of service not my previous addresses...So even thou I have been with them for just over 6 years they only show it as 3 because my new address...  So my billing has gone like this:  First year-$99 cable with HBO and Cinamax and internet Second year- $104 cable with HBO and Cinamax and internet Third year-$120 cable with HBO and Cinamax and internet Fourth year-$140 cable with HBO and Cinamax and internet Fifth year-$170-cable with HBO and Cinamax and internet added sports package...supposedly $8 extra a month.  Sixth year- $220-cable with HBO and Cinamax and internet added sports package  All this pricing has come with haggling with the loyalty department, supposedly my introduction packages expire every year and the prices keep going up. And they say that I never paid what I paid before, I am like I can show you the bills! No dice, whatever promotion I was under has always expired...  How about your prices stay the same...just like the services.  There will not be a seventh year. I canceled all my services except for my internet. The girl, was like...well since your not bundling your internet bill will be $72 a month instead of $42. I was like beats $220 and hung up.   So then I go to the local store to turn in my cable boxes, and the girl on the phone canceled the cancel order. I had to resubmit it via the store. I hate Cox. This does not even go into how many times I had outages or how many years I had bad services, and how many hours of my life wasted on the phone with customer service and waiting for service techs to come out and fix things, which never truly got fixed.   This company has a monopoly and its ridiculous.

Came in here tonight to grab some dinner, seemed like the healthiest option at the moment, Just got a sandwich to go and the place was pretty much empty, but what I saw was clean. And William the sandwich artist was pretty friendly even though he did forget a few items that were suppose to go on my Turkey bacon guacamole sub in the process of making it. He did hook it up thou after the fact, and made sure to go out of his way to get it right.  All in all a good experience with the staff and the sandwich was good.

I went here tonight because I had a coupon for buy one Whopper get one free...the time was 10:35 when I pulled up to the drive thru menu, and the girl on the other end is obviously laughing and giggling over the intercom with a co worker...so finally she is like "Can I take you order?" I tell her what I want...and that I have the coupon for the two whoppers BOGO. She says "What's the coupon #, anything else?" I say I would like cheese on that and she then gives me my total. Not asking if I wanted anything else, I didn't. But she still didn't ask. So she is like "please drive around." So as I round the corner of the drive thru there is two cars in front of me and the first car is pulling out. So I am thinking, great I will have my food soon. I had worked a 13 hour shift so I was really hungry.   15 minutes later I am still sitting in my truck waiting I have not moved nor is the car in front of me...I can see the people in front of me are as just as frustrated. I finally am like screw this and proceed to back out of the drive thru no easy feet in a big truck. It is 10:50. As I am backing out they shut off all the lights to the drive thru and all the building signs...ridiculous. Worst experience ever at a Burger King,  I will be calling to speak to the owner or franchise manager tomm.   Will never come here again.

I recently had a chip/crack  in my windshield, and these guys were great, they helped me with my insurance company, walked me thru the conference call with my insurance company before we actually made the three way call to them, they tech came right to my place of business and was very friendly and did the windshield replacement while I was at work.  No hassle really easy A +

I went to Zipps to watch the Red Wings lose in the second round of the NHL Playoffs this year...I was there after work one day with two co-workers and several other co-workers happen to come by since it is right down the street from where we all work. Our waitress was Lauren, not very good, she was slow, I kept having to wave down other girls to get stuff refills on my pints of Blue moon and shots. I got the Jalapeno Burger, was not to bad, was actually surprised at how good it was on the bad side, the bottom of the bun fell apart because it was quite soggy and these are heavy duty buns. Also got the chips and Salsa...nothing to write home about. The service here was not that great, and the server seemed like she had a bit of an attitude, my co-workers felt the same...and considering my check was $85 I would have expected better, when you are ordering multiple shots of patron silver and you ask your waitress for patron platinum to start you need to recognize the significance. We haven't been back here since and I probably wont go back here ever.

Was here today to buy Advil for a throbbing headache...I think I got when I was at Walmart...In any event, this place was clean, the girl that said "Welcome to Walgreen's" with a big smile on her face that rang up my only purchase, made my whole day...it was a bad day...I want to say her name as Gini...but it evades me at the moment. I joked with her that she should only have to say it to every third person that walks in, and she said it wouldn't be fair if she said it to some people and not everyone...pretty valid point...she was my one ray of sunshine in what I can call a pretty bad day...everyone seemed helpful thou when I was there, my trip was pretty quick...and I was actually quite surprised at how organized this place was, it has been quite a while since I had been here. Definitely liked the changes.

I do not feel like a celebrity when I tan here, but I do enjoy the service, for the most part the girls that run this place are top notch, I never have to show my little key chain thingy and usually have my account up before I even get through the door, the place is always clean and I think I only had to wait for a bed once. The hours are great. Overall it is very nice for Phoenix.  Drawbacks and the reason this place did not get 5 stars:  1. In most of the beds you do not have any way to listen to your own music, and they only play one radio station, and considering the age of the attendants you can expect to hear the Jonas Brothers or Maroon 5 or hip hop every time you are there. I like to relax when I tan...not feeling Fergies newest lady lump song when I am laying in a bed thank you.  2.   There are no mirrors in the dressing room, I would like to see if I have have sweat or undissolved lotion all over me when I get out of the bed. One of the girls told me the owner doesn't believe in mirrors due to the fact he thinks that people would spend to much time in the rooms looking at themselves after they got done in the beds. R u serious!!!!..people tan to look better not for their health of course they are going ot look at themselves. Put in mirrors!!!  3. In general I do not think their beds are that strong, I did not get really dark here after 3 Solid months of tanning with lotion..really expensive lotion!!!    4. They do not have a ton of lotions to choose from! Maybe two brands which they will try to push on you when you first sign up or are running out.  Close put no fifth star celebrity I prefer Darque Tan in Scottsdale as the best tanning salon in the valley. Sorry Celebrity!

OK, so I had a meeting in the Kirland Corporate center the other morning, with a business associate and while trying to find breakfast  place after our meeting I discovered this place. Unfortunately when we got there we missed breakfast by like 7 minutes. Get there before 10am for breakfast!  So lunch it was. My self and a friend both got the turkey sandwich Mine cold and his hot. We had to trade halves cause we were both going on about how each one was awesomer then the other! These by far are probably two of the best sandwiches that were ever assembled on this planet seriously that good.   This place is worth the drive to the area and the staff was extremely friendly along with Ashly Young/Chef slash Manager or Owner I assume. In any event she was great this place was great and I highly recommend going there.

Sprinkles cupcakes...should aptly be renamed the 3 pound cupcake of frosting heaven...or something similar along those lines...so I had to go deliver a package today so I went to the Fed-EX by Sprinkles and said fuck it I will try one of these mysterious cupcakes I have heard so much about.  Plus that every women I know of in Scottsdale raves about this place...and when I walked in seriously I was like the only guy there...I think they put pheromones in their cupcakes or something that lures women in...but I could be mistaken...  In any event the cupcake I wanted was not available today the peanut butter chip cupcake so I went for the vanilla Milk chocolate cupcake...now when they put this thing in the bag I assumed it was a light little fluffy cupcake...I kind of scoffed at the fact they were going to charge almost 4 bucks for this thing but when I lifted up the little cupcake bag it was in I was wondering if they baked these cupcakes with lead.   It was heavy and I thought maybe they screwed up and gave me two of them or something...anyhow the temptation to devour it there was unbearable but I managed to make it back to the office with out breaking down. Once I pulled this thing out of the bag and got a good look at it I would swear that it had it's own little aura around it..like it was a cupcake sent from heaven just for me.  In any event I devoured this thing in under two minutes and can honestly say it was probably the best cupcake I have ever eaten...sorry to all the kids mom's that made cupcakes that I had growing up at birthday parties and sleepovers...you ain't got shit on Sprinkles...this place is the bomb diggity!  I will be sure to go back one day...but not any time soon for fear of being addicted to them like the many cougars and slightly overweight teens I saw salivating over them in the store...

So being within walking distance to this Safeway, makes this place awesome. Plus this store is always super clean, and smells good. I find that every one that works here seems to be super nice and tries to help out as much as they can. The store has a good selection of beer and the wine and champagne selection is not typical. It's like a mini Total Wine store in here.  I would suggest checking it out. There is a starbucks in the store, a redbox, a coinstar, and a gift card exchange. Which is pretty cool within itself, in the last 6 months the store itself has gone thru some renovations the pharmacy area is now much larger and I feel like the have expanded their selection. They also have a small selection of Kosher foods. This place s a little pricey, but you gotta expect that being that there is so much competition in the area from other markets. I still like Fresh and Easy better, but this place is a close second. There is a Blue post office box outside, plenty of parking. And they always seem to have a great floral department. Open till midnight 7 days a week.

So Chinese buffet is my guilty food pleasure...and this place by far is my new place to go to enjoy that pleasure. I can tell I will be here allot!  I can honestly say I LOVE THIS BUFFET!  I do Chinese buffet as my cheat day food of choice. It's all you can eat for crying out loud.  So I have been to this place twice now and felt it was worthy of my time on Yelp.  So I can honestly say that this is one of the largest buffets I have ever been to in Phoenix, I mean this place has so much to choose from I almost thought I was in Vegas for a minute. And in general everything is pretty tasty.   The food at this place is delicious and trust me in the two times I have been there I can honestly say that I have tried pretty much close to everything they have that I like.   Must tries, is the bacon wrapped shrimp, the Italy shrimp, they do have some great shrimp items...and any of the soups or deserts.  Along with the orange chicken or any of the vegetable trays.   There are a few thing I will say that I thought could be a bit better...the sushi is good...but get there early because it seems to sit out all day long, and if you are there later, it is definitely something I would stay away from, but buffet sushi I am sure is near impossible to keep fresh I am sure, and their egg-rolls seem to be very bland.   And the crab puffs...NOW I LOVE ME SOME CRAB PUFFS...but I will say I am not sure that whatever is in these things is even cream cheese..it tasted more like allot of flour mixed in with very little cheese. The crab legs also seem to be a bit small, but they have fricken crab legs for crying out loud so I guess I can't complain.   I will say that the staff here is very friendly and on top of drink service, and I really like the fact that give you the check at the end of your meal with fortune cookies like more of a traditional sit down Chinese restaurant rather than a buffet.  I enjoy this place thoroughly, and suggest giving it a try.

This is absolutely the worst WalMart I have been to in the continental United States.   I figured in stead of writing about I would just give 10 key points on why to avoid it.  1. Customer service sucks...every department customer service sucks. Pharmacy...yup sucks, Photo Center yup it sucks, Return Department/Customer Care...sucks like a starving baby on a teet sucks, General help around the store...definitely sucks.  2. There is never ever ever ever EVER enough registers open.  3. If you have a specific question on  product or need to find something specific plan on losing it least 30 minutes of your life either waiting for a customer service rep or anyone to answer it.  4. THIS PLACE IS DIRTY...like you might get Hepatitis C in the produce department...I have literally seen little hood rat kids...take stuff off the shelf after picking their runny nose...eat part of an item...like strawberries or grapes and then put it back in the bin with the rest of the food.  5. Plan on getting hit up for any multiple of things in the parking lot...prostitution, money, tamales, the list is endless...and this parking lot smells worse then most city dumps I have been to.  6. Long lines...like when they are busy plan on making sure your phone is charged to catch up on all your games....typically you can plan on being 5 to 6 carts back waiting...the self check outs are not any faster...and they are not truly self check outs...because there is so much theft in this store...they are somewhat manned by window licking retards for the most part who still have trouble looking for a bar code.   7. Staff...I can honestly say I do not think this location drug tests. Some of the reps in this store look like they are on crack or meth and maybe have been clean for a week or less, there uniforms are almost always dirty, most of them don't wear uniforms, or name tags and it is hard to find an actual employee...and hygiene standard does not exist here. Examples of responses I have gotten when asking an employee here for help: a. I am on my lunch break (my favorite) b. No Habla English...(really...really!) c. I am deaf, I can't help you. (in what sounded like a fake deaf person voice) d. Its not my department.  8. Pricing is not accurate...the price on an item will say $1.99 on the shelf, but if you go home and check your receipt carefully you might have gotten charged $2.29 for it. This has happened multiple times...but after going to the customer service line...waited almost 40 minutes till I got to the front...plus the time for them to go check the price on the shelf and come back to customer service...my time was worth more then the .60 cents to get refunded.  9. Stuff every where were it shouldn't be. Like yogurt on the dog food shelf, which I am sure eventually gets put back with the rest of the yogurt...GROSS. Expired items being sold in the dairy department...I purchased several packages of Cream Cheese, got home and noticed they had past there expiration date.   10. This Walmart as a whole...this store has not changed, I have lived in Phoenix now for 15 years, and thru out time this place has gotten worse and worse. I would think being a multi-billion dollar company would take a little more pride in its stores...how about the Walton family take a pay cut and hire a few more employees at this location to pick up the slack. I absolutely loathe going here anytime between 10am and 1am...I try to go only for essentials only...usually late late at night when there is not 200 people there...and several times I find myself driving to the North Scottsdale location...which is like night and day compared to this location.  Anyhow my points got a little lengthy...to be precise I can sum up this place in 2 words.  IT SUCKS!

Why this place sucks: Let me count the ways.   I came here about 3 times before I said never again.   1. I have a flat, it is the stem of the tire, no damage to the actual tire. Tire is brand new they try to sell me a new tire. Now bare in mind I have spacers on my truck to adjust for the shape of my over-sized rims so the brake pads will connect properly to the rotors when stopping. (never mentioned, replaced stem, at a minimal cost)  2. Same day, Notice that I have a screw sticking out of the bottom of one of my tires...(Pirelli Scorpions) said they could not remove the screw and repair the tire because I did not buy the tire @ discount tire.   Try to sell me new tire.   Refused to buy new tire, would not let me put the tire back on the truck and allow me to leave saying it was a safety hazard.   At this point I become extremely upset, they want to put on my spare tire, in order to remove my spare I need to remove a good portion of speakers and amps from my trucks back cargo area,  when I argue with them they tell me they will find me a substitute to replace the tire with the nail in it. I tell them I want my old tire, as I would get it repaired somewhere else. I tell them to put the nail tire in my trunk, they call me out, they did not have a used tire my size in stock, so they put on a tire that was about in inch smaller.   I leave...angry.   I have been at the shop over 3 hours, originally told i would only be there 30 minutes.   I get home, find out they did not put my tire in my trunk, but they did take one of my spacers off and put that in the trunk.   I call the shop they are closed. I leave a message no call back.   So now I have one wheel with no spacer and a tire that is smaller then the other and I can hear my brake pads and rotors on that tire grind away every time I drive because the off size tire and the spacer missing.  The next day. I call again. I talk to a staff member who says that the tire got put in the back and their pickup semi truck that takes their used tires to California picked it up an left with it, said they would track it down and get it back to me...meanwhile my brakes and rotors are getting worse, TWO WEEKS go by, multiple calls with no return calls. Finally at the threat of having an attorney contact them, they call me and say they will replace the tire with a brand new one...they could not get the same tire I had (Pirelli) apparently it is not in stock. So they replace it with a Michelin.   I am pissed. I go and buy another Michelin at tirerack.com so at least they match, go to the shop, and the put them both on and put my spacer back on after much fuss.  3. I buy new tires. TIRERACK.com (the best bang for your buck) Go to discount tire to have discount put the new tires on. Not only will they refuse...first issue they claim, the spacers, I explain that two weeks earlier you just put on two new tires with the spacers with no problem, the manager on duty says it is against company policy and tells me they would never do that. I show him the receipt. Still says they didn't do it. I have the bloody receipt MAN!!!! I SWEAR I WANTED TO PUNCH THIS DUDE....SECOND ISSUE, I didn't buy the tires there, he says because I bought them at tirerack.com I am basically paying what he pays for them, and he can't mark them up or warranty them because they are not DISCOUNT TIRE tires. I AM LIVID!!!!!!  I go down the street to a Mexican shop, put them on and balanced in less then an hour, no issue with spacers, no problem with my tires since....  4. I did have to have my brand new rotors ground down and remounted due to their complete incompetence. Which in turn cost me MORE MONEY.  Don't go here...EVER.  And they will try to sell you new tires at every sign of wear or excuse they can come up with even when you don't need them.   Scam. NEVER WILL GO TO DISCOUNT AGAIN.

Not a big fan of Hooters normally, but my best friends sister use to work here. So he knows all the girls, and there is nothing bad about getting mobbed by hot hooter chicks coming by your table to say hi, when your eating your chicken salad. Special shout out to our server Danielle L. Thanks for a great start to our night.

Cin Cin pronounced CHIN CHIN which means cheers in Italian!  This is a great little bistro type lounge. It is a posh little lounge with unique little decorations and a small patio great for small groups.  The food here is excellent the service is good and this place is never real busy so it is a nice place to enjoy a quick bite before you do the club scene so you don't get extremely wasted on an empty stomach, a great little starter place for you and some friends.  The location is great too, right across from the W and and down the street from Axis N Radius, Suede, and PCL. This is definitely a good spot to meet at for before binge drinking in old town.   I got a bottle of Pelgrino water and the stuff portabello mushroom, with the vinaigrette spinach. This was excellent probably one of the better portabello mushroom meals I have eaten around the valley.

Would have to say this location was a better experience then the location in old town, the hostess was attentive and nice, there was no wait and our server Taylor was polite and on point with drink refills and information.  Got the happy hour menu and the soft shell crab roll and a few other items and was please with almost everything at this location, it's also cleaner and the layout is set up significantly better in my opinion compared to the one in old-town.

So being the foodie that I am I am always down to try new places, this place had a table at the last Yelp event I went to with my fiance and we really enjoyed it so we thought we would go in and give it a try.  I thoroughly enjoyed everything that we tried and it all lived up to what I know about Indian cuisine. Spicy and good.  The only thing I disliked about this place is that the service was a bit slow. they only had one waitress working the whole place in the middle of lunch rush, which I thought was a bit ridiculous considering that there were 14 tables with people at them...seemed like a bit much for one girl even though this place is a bit small and you had to wait quite a while for your refills.   Besides that the waitress was very friendly and informative, I would not go out of my way to go eat here again but definitely enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  More like 3 & half stars.

Krispy Kreme if you have been in Arizona @ least 10 years you remember going to Tempe Mall & going to the Krispy Kreme store & getting a hot glazed donut fresh from the oven or fresh donut holes.  What's the point of doing Krispy Kreme if they are not fresh, instead you get hours old trucked in donuts.  So I was @ this location the day of the grand opening, hence comes the nightmare. Below is my letter to the CEO:  05-18-2009  To whom it may concern, or the CEO of Krispy Kreme  I guess this has to do with my KK story, so KK recently opened a location near my apartment on Indian School Rd. in Phoenix, so I was there at their grand opening & got the GPS unit and the T shirt, & license plate holder & sunscreen & did the treasure hunt & got the years worth of free coffee and 52 weeks of free donuts. So every time I pick up a dozen for myself or someone else I tell them my story about how I camped out in front of the store at 4:30am and drove all over the valley looking for the free donuts and coffee to get all the stuff I got. So it has been great...until recently.  So I have been going into store #866 which is the store I received all these prizes at and have been getting my free donuts and coffee occasionally and also have talked with several of the store managers who have allowed me to pay the difference between the regular dozen and mixed dozen so I can enjoy all your donuts not just the plain glazed donuts, and I don't mind paying the extra cash out of pocket so I can enjoy all your donuts at a minimal cost, and KK is not taking a total loss on donuts by just giving them to me for free, it was also explained that due to the fact that I might not get a dozen donuts every week, I can get multiple donuts and they will stamp my card accordingly until I get my 52 dozen.  So the problem that I have had is several of your regular employees specifically Madelena which is the name on my current receipt which I am assuming is the name of the employee I dealt with since she was not wearing a name tag when I went into the store who is there almost every morning early before the manager is there and also this older white women that works with her have made it quite difficult for me to get any donuts at times.    First off stating that they won't let me pay the difference which I have worked out with several managers at this location, stating several different reasons one they can not authorize it if the manager isn't there, secondly the managers that approved that deal supposedly don't work at that location any more, and seemingly any excuse they can think of, even though I have done this at one other location in the valley.   Secondly they are telling me that I can not get more then a dozen donuts at a time, even though I have missed several weeks, because the card says only a dozen per week on it. So if I go in two days in a row and they happen to be there from the day before I was there they will tell me that I can not use the card because I already got my donuts for the week. Which in turn I just drive out of my way to another location, if I really want donuts that day.   It has turned into quite a hassle with these two individuals, who seem to be on a power trip of some sort, and I feel quite embarrassed when they tell me in front of other customers that I can not use the perks given to me, it tends to be an unnecessary and embarrassing scene.   I don't know what their problem is KK is winning all the way around, if I get a mixed dozen, and get to talk about how great you are to all my friends and colleagues who eat your donuts it is publicity and advertising all year round or at least till I go through my 52 dozen. Plus I pay the extra for the mixed donuts and KK ends up getting money in the till from me at the end of the day. Not everyone enjoys just regular donuts over and over for 52 weeks, and since I AM PAYING for the difference in cost why shouldn't I be able to do this. All I can say is several times, these two particular employees have made it difficult to enjoy my perks that KK has given me. Is there anything that can be done so I can get my donuts and not get hassled every time I go in to this location?   Perry B.  P.S. I emailed this almost two months ago via the contact on the website and never received a response.   Krispy Kreme response about a month later:  Dear Mr. B  Thank you for your email regarding your local Krispy Kreme's promotion. We appreciate the time you took to share your feedback. We are committed to satisfying our customers and strive to meet the highest expectations placed upon us. We have forwarded your message to the appropriate personnel for their review. The management staff here at Krispy Kreme is always interested in customer feedback. We recognize that our success is measured by the satisfaction of our customers. Please accept our apology for any inconvenience this matter may have caused you.  We look forward to serving you again in the future.  Sincerely, Shaun Wilkins KK

I have a friend that  has a Bistro downtown...and he keeps telling me to come in to check it out, so I called him tonight to get directions and he said that he is only open for lunch. He then referred me to Sens, and said it was a lovely Sake Tapas, with traditional Asian food and flair.  I was not disappointed. Our server Christian  by far was very helpful and very informative on every meal  and item on the menu, he also had a huge amount of knowledge about the different saki's, to his credit I think Sens needs to give him a raise, if I owned a restaurant I would be trying to convince him to leave and come work for me, but since I don't own a restaurant Sens is safe.   What we had:  Tokkuri Daiginjo Saki which went well with our meal and for a small bottle was only $7.00 bucks  The Miso soup with shrimp was delicious, and the flat rice noodles  in this soup are to die for, and is full of exotic vegetables and the shrimp in it was large, plentiful and tasted fresh. This was $10.00 but is more then enough for two people it comes in a iron cast bowl with a wooden spoon and cover very authentic.  My friend got the Wasabe Tofu with the soy Wasabi and minced garlic crumbs, this was delicious, I do not like tofu that much but could probably die eating this stuff because it was so good.  This was only $4.00.  I got the Wasabi Soy  chicken which was delicious.  This was $7.00 and well worth it there was more then enough for me.  A few added extras about this place, the water is infused with cucumber and you can see a piece or two of it floating within the serving pitcher it is just enough to give the water a sweet  but fresh taste.   The ambiance is nice,  very low lit and the music is very modern I heard everything from Sugar Hill Gang to Massive Attack and Portishead...very cool.  There is a monk statue in the front of the door way where people seem to put money on at the base of the statue, the server  said people do it for good karma...we left a dollar...hopefully it will come back to us.:)  The total was $30.00 bucks great for two people. Love this place will definitely be back.

Love this place, love the concept. Great food.  I go to this place at least two or three times a month, usually if not for any other reason then to get a Medicine Man, they make me feel good.  Was recently there with a few buddies, and we enjoyed the Shrimp Dumplings the Curry Bowl tofu and the turkey Pita, everything here is always delicious and the service is top notch, the staff is very friendly and very informative.  I highly suggest if you like healthy food to try this place out it is definitely worth it. The only reason this place does not get 5 stars is because I do feel it is a bit pricey. But I guess you get what you pay for more like 4 & half stars.

I went to this location after picking up a friend from work, because she was hungry, and it was on the way home. The wait in the drive thru, was fairly short, and about the only good thing about this location. But when I got to the window the girl in the window, ruined the whole experience, she was quite rude, and did not appear to speak very much English.   She failed to give us one of our drinks we had ordered and paid for, and had to ask for it. She also did not give us any straws, which we did not notice till after we left the drive thru. We also ordered a 5 piece chicken nugget, and asked for barbecue sauce. The girl said that Wendy's only carried one type of sauce, honey mustard, and that is all we could have. In general this experience was horrible, the burger I got in the Baconator combo was crushed, the fries were old and stale tasting and the 5 piece chicken nuggets were old and dry.   I feel that it was toward the end of the night on a Sunday and this employee was not happy to be there and also I think they gave us old food, that was pre-made and had been sitting for a while. Either that or she was poorly trained, I am sure the language barrier had something to do with it too!

OK, So I went back to this location for my FREE meal, well there was no problem with getting the free meal, except that the girl at the counter that rang it up must have been stoned, because in between punching in my order which was pretty simple because it was on a receipt right in front of her and her singing a Brittany Spears tune, it took her like almost 10 minutes to ring it up, while I am standing there forgot to give me cups for my drinks, which I had to ask her for, and in general the food once again was crap, the fries were dry and hard, the nuggets tasted OK, and the burger was once again crushed. I use to like Wendy's I guess this what you must come to expect from today's fast food business.

So I have been here since my first review, and its always the same, dried out fries, and burgers that looked like the fat ass staff sat there fat asses on it before they push it thru the drive thru windows...I swear I took a bite out of a baconator and the bacon tasted rotten. I have decided I will only go here for frosty's if I am craving one and it's like 1am and there is no other options anywhere...and that's it. Which means I will never go back...Gross. Wendy's use to be one of my favorite fast food places to eat...not anymore.

The people that work in this post office are the reason people use the U.S. mail less and less. The customer service here is horrible, the staff is rude and in general lazy. I have been here multiple times but my visit on 1/29/15 was by far some of the worst acts of customers service I have seen in my entire life...  First off...this place is only open till 4:30pm. Not 5pm...4:30pm....so if you think your going to get there after a typical work day you are sadly mistaken.   I pulled in right at 4:30, I went to go in, there were still people inside, and the door was open, immediately I had 3 representatives yelling "We're closed, you need to leave!"  Now bare in mind two out of these 3 people had customers in front of them. At that time a women comes up to me and says, "I am 87 years old, I was driven all the way from Mesa to pick up a check that is here waiting for me, I had to find a ride, I need the money real bad to pay my bills, I don't know when I can come back and they said that because I got here after 4:30 they could not help me!" I looked at my watch 4:37.  So she must have walked in here like a minute after 4:30 because I walked in an had literally been in here about a total of about 2 minutes from the time I parked.   She was practically in tears. I told her I thought it was ridiculous, I turned and walked out. What could I do?  The people here all need to be reprimanded, the Asian guy is the worst. The guy barely speaks English, how the hell did he get a job working for the U.S. government. And he never wants to do anything, I had bought some postage online and wanted a receipt for it saying they were processed, and he told me he couldn't do it, I had to get a supervisor just for a receipt...Hello. I made a transaction here...I want a record of it. Most the time I have been here they are really understaffed and service is slow, even when it is empty.  This place is a joke. Everyone here should be laid off, fired or retired.   For the amount of money these people get paid to basically push buttons, and sell stamps, the retirement they have being government employees and to treat the people that come here like second class citizen is truly unacceptable. DON'T GO HERE EVER.

Wednesday night at American Junkie...RULEZ!!! So maybe I am a little biased with this review because I was filming in here tonight and the staff was extremely courteous to me.  But overall this place rocks, very fun atmosphere, the food was great, and I had a comped tab, but the drinks I did pay for were reasonable priced.   I got a chicken sandwich with the sweet potato fries and the fresh fruit everything was good! Plus the kitchen is open to midnight which is a huge plus for any club as far as I am concerned.  The music rocked and ALL the shakers and movers of Scottsdale were at this place.   Josh Royal and staff were great, will definitely be back!  This place should really get 4 and 1/2 stars!!!

I so have an antenna ball from here!!!  I normally try to stay away from fast food places because in general their locations and quality of food and service suck balls.  Well I only hit this location thru the drive thru usually pretty late after midnight or even later, which is a plus because this is a 24 hour location.   The only down point of this review..which negated me from giving them the all coveted five stars is that they never seem to have shakes when I go..which sucks...I always go at shake machine cleaning time or something.  In any event the last several times I have gone here, they have aced my order every time the food is presentable and seems to be made pretty fresh, I have become a fan of the Chicken Terraki Bowl Combo and any one of their burgers I especially like the Triple Bacon Cheeseburger Combo with the spicy curly fries.  For a fast food place this particular location seems to have it together, I am sure it has to do with the staff they have right now.  I hope they keep up the good work because it is nice to actually enjoy your food once in a while when you have to eat fast food.

So I have friends that RAVE about this place...and today one of them said I had to go, lunch is on me...and free meals are always cool!!!  First thing I noticed and liked  is the fact that the Valet is complimentary nice touch. The decor is cool and the seating is comfortable.   So what I really enjoyed about this place is the fact that the staff even though you can't always tell who they are is extremely courteous and professional, and very attentive. The fact that on Monday's they have 5 dollar glasses of wine that normally go for twice as much on any normal day.   I got the vegetarian sandwich which was delicious along with some ice tea while my friend just enjoyed the discounted wine:)  The only reason this place does not get 5 stars from me, is the fact that they did not have the nutrition information on any of their menu items...trying to eat healthy when I can...so I was a bit disappointed about that I mean if  I gorge myself at Del Taco...at least I know how many calories I am eating....I don't know call me a little girl about it. Just wished they had it.  Otherwise this place rocks...more like 4 and half stars...damn it Yelp get with the half a star program already!!!

Was frequenting the Central Phoenix area and was going to go to Pizzeria Bianco but unfortunately they closed at 10pm so being in the area I want to go someplace chill with good food, so I had been to Postinos' before in the afternoon during the lunch rush and their fabulous wine happy hour, and gotten a sandwich but never had dinner there.  So due to the fact the pizza place was closed, I went in for dinner my date had the side salad with a glass of wine...and I had a bowl of soup of the day along with the turkey sandwich and some organic chips.  The food and service was perfect along with the ambiance of the location, it was quiet there were only 5 or 6 people in the whole place besides the staff.  We split one of the Tammie's cakes for desert..and my date almost died of sugar overload...she explained that sex that evening would not be necessary due to the chocolate desert that she had just consumed. Not sure if that was a good thing or not...:(  This place was perfect it gets better every time I go there. A must stop visit if you are on central in Phoenix. Great food, great wine, great service, great ambiance deserving of all 5 stars.

I am in love...this place rocks... I have been there twice in the last three days, and so far tried the Mojo classic chocolate and the pomegranate and both were delicious....  So delicious that both times I got brain freeze from indulging them so fast...you think I would have remembered after the first time..but this stuff is so good you throw caution to the wind and jump right in.  Whats really great about this place is that it is self serve. You have several different options you basically walk in and on the back is a shelve of tester cups, so you can sample the different types before you make a decision.  That is so choice!!!!  So after you sample you can choose either a small or large bowl along with a cup to have a smoothie made...you make you selection and then you continue down to the buffet of extras, butter finger crumbs, pecan pieces, fresh black berries and razz berries, m&m's, and pretty much anything you can think of.    When your all done, you set your cup or smoothie on a scale and pay by the pound not what you get which is a great concept. The staff is always friendly and helpful   Love this place.  Only drawbacks, it is always pretty busy all the time, there is not a lot of room and is kind of small, and the staff may be nice but they are kind of slow.

So I have used this company before to change out the locks in my business several times. And they have always been fast, professional and decently priced.  In the past.  As of recently had them come out to put a dummy in one of my locks, and they charged me $100! The owner Levi said he paid $26 a piece for the two dummy's. I looked them up online and the highest price I found for them was $6 including shipping. He was here 5 minutes. Not really happy with this visit.   Do not think the pricing was fair this time. Especially since I am a repeat customer.   Levi does good work. But think the price was a bit high for what I asked him to do.

So I have been here about 4 times and every time I go I have a good experience.  I would have to say they have some of the best bruschetta around and if you want brick oven pizza I would suggest this place over Pizzeria Bianco any day of the week...plus that there is never a two hour wait!  I would say they are a bit pricey! But the food definitely doesn't make you feel cheated. And what I really like about the decor of this place  is the little veggies on the vine as you walk into the front door gives this place a cool vibe. Kind of a modern place. Like the lay out quite a bit.   Only down fall is the seats at the bar are not very comfortable and the do not have a foot rail so your kind of hanging there and the booths can be a bit small if your a big guy like me but that aside this place is the bomb.

This place sucks...it could be a nice laundromat as laundromats go but unfortunately, they let 20 little kids run through the store pouring cherry flavored sugar straws in with your laundry, and not cleaning up the place..there is always one Mexican lady there who never speaks...I don't think she speaks English, but is never very helpful.   I hate this laundromat with a passion they need to get some better help in here and have more control over the people that wash here. Plus that it is virtually in possible to get a hold of any one if you want to complain and no one has ever answered one of the comment cards I have left, most of  the time they do not have them, I have been ripped off here had laundry ruined.  Not worth it to go here.

Went here late the other night to get a bite to eat...I thought this place was open 24hours...I was wrong, got kicked out at 3am...not quite kicked out but the manager kept hinting that we would have to go soon.  Would not suggest eating here...the service was OK, except the waitress got my order wrong. In general the restaurant was clean.  I got the turkey club sandwich...it was quite stale, and did not taste very good, the seasoned fries were OK my date for the evening got a salad...what else is new right...anyhow she ate it all so it must have been OK.  I have experienced better not very impressed with this location.

Came here with my gf for dinner the other night. WE ordered the Shrimp Scampi appetizer the Chick and Shrimp Carbonara the Seafood Alfredo with the Caesar Salad. Everything was delicious. The service was excellent and our waiter Brian G was on point. We never had to wait for a drink refill, and he was very informative and helpful.  We had a fabulous experience. Everything was perfect, we could not have had a better dining experience. The ambiance was good, this place is always busy, but we did not have to wait and were seated right away. I will definitely be coming back here in the near future.

Wings...wings...wings...the Buffalo Wings here are super good. I got the wings with extra sauce, and they were to die for. I mean I don't rave about wings that often but these were super super good. Mad Props to our server Paige for the suggestion. Ice cold 32 oz mugs of Blue Moon, got to watch the Saturday Games on plenty of TV's. Service was excellent, food was good plenty of seating and good atmosphere for a game day. Will definitely be back.

Went to this place about a week ago with a gf and her daughter just to try it out. Did not really get to much because I  was not that hungry but will say this about the place, it was clean the staff was friendly and knowledgeable, and the bits and pieces I did try from picking at my friends food was good. Definitely willing to give it another shot and try out the menu a bit more.  This is more like fast food Italian food than a sit down place. Price was descent and quality was good. Need further review.

If you are from the Midwest...then this place is a little piece of home. The food is great and the service is impeccable. I have a Culver's in my hometown of Marquette, Michigan but can honestly say that I have never ever been there, due to the fact they came to town after I moved to AZ...but all my friends back home swear by it and as soon as this place opened up, my buddy here from Chicago swore by it up and down, he said that he was really happy that one opened up so close to him because he normally drives to the one location in Mesa at least once a month to get his fix so with all this raving I had to go try it out.   I got the Mushroom n Swiss single with cheddar cheese fries and a strawberry smoothie...REAL CHEESE...OMG REAL CHEESE...amazing. To say the least the burger was good, the cheese chili fires are a heart attack in a tray and the smoothie was outstanding.  I will say this about Culver's even though I enjoyed it thoroughly if you are on a diet this is not the place for you, almost everything on their menu has upwards of 600 calories or more...in fact I saw some things like their 4 piece fried chicken has over 2000 calories. So not a great place for dieters...it doesn't help either that they sell pints and quarts of their ice cream to go....by the way which is also delicious.   What I felt was nice about this location is that you can sit inside and they open up the front of the store with these huge bay doors to out door seating which allowed for a cool night breeze to come in and you feel like you sitting outdoors indoors. Great big TV's with sports on...and a ton of staff to basically take care of your every need while you eat.  Culver's is definitely worth the visit. The food is great and the service is untouchable for a fast food place. If you have never been I highly suggest going at least once to check it out.

So I have not been to Goodwill in quite a while I have two by my house, but don't find myself going in very much to see much of anything. I just assumed it was mostly junk. But after visiting this location, that might change. So I was heading home with a co-worker on Thursday and she said today is dollar day, I am like what is dollar day? She explains on Thursday everything with a green tag is only a buck. Well I was like ok lets check it out...to say the least I didn't buy anything that was a dollar, but I found an LG Blueray player that works fantastic, and a drill that was exactly what I was looking for. To say the least I was colored surprised. I spent about $35, and it was worth every penny the blueray player alone was worth over $100. I am a fan, I will be back. This place had some really really cool stuff.

So I went in here a few weeks back to mail out something I had sold on ebay...I was in a hurry on my way home from work and saw the sign on Scottsdale road and thought what the heck, I don't live in the area, and I have no clue where a Post office is around here, and I needed to ship it that day. I walked in and there was a few customers in front of me, but being helped in different areas of the counter. So I walked up to an open area, and stood there for a few minutes with my package not even being acknowledged...finally when I did get helped, The kid who helped me wasn't very polite.   I guess my biggest complaint was the fact that the shipping was about $20 for my package...wouldn't normally complain but I want to say that something fishy was going on with there pricing I think they over charged me, when I got home to add the tracking # eBay said it should of only cost about $14 to ship the item via UPS based of the dimensions and the weight. I did say something about it in the store and the kid just kind of snickered looked at the other gentleman and said Ebay...like there was some joke about it.   So I think this place has some shady business practices but I can't be certain...in any event it was a one time stop I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone based on that alone.

It seems every time I go to this location it gets worse and worse. My latest visit just seems to prove it. The only thing I like about this place is the order screen. It's cool that you can actually see who you are talking to, and you know they cant screw up your order because you can literally read it in front of you.   Besides that, this place is so so, I was here last Saturday, I ordered two items...only 1 or 2 cars in front of me...was not busy inside and yet it took almost 10 minutes to get to the window and then another 5 minutes to get my drink, they screwed up my order and had to remake it. Typically in the past when visiting this location with a wait as long as I had when you get to the window they would comp your drink for the inconvenience. Not any more. Service is bad, and its super slow, definitely don't go here if your in a hurry. Indian School and 28th st. is my new favorite Starbucks...this place has fallen far from its former glory.

So I use to live by this place 10 years ago when it was Pink Peppermint Thai. And I use to love to go there. I would say that the place has not changed much. But it also isn't what it used to be. The menu's definitely needs a work over, all they did was black out the name and re laminate them. The prices I feel are a little high, but you did get pretty large portions for the amount. I enjoyed pretty much everything I had but I will say this about the chicken. I tasted a bit freezer burnt. But for the most part it was descent. Also the dishes were not as spicy as I remember them. I asked for an 8 on my spicy chicken curry and it tasted more like a 3 with the spice. We had the chicken on a stick and the chicken seemed a bit dry. All I can say is this place was OK...Chicken needs work. Same old Pink Peppermint. Think it has gone down hill a bit. Also I was with my fiance and her 3 year old daughter NO KIDS MENU!

So I love this place like literally love it.   It's close to were I live, so it's super convenient and the fact that they are open 24 hours in my opinion is awesome.    I love the fact that it gives me healthy choices and they are affordable, and they always have better pricing then places like Trader Joe's or Whole foods which are right down the street in either direction. They always have red tag specials, and different coupons you can use to reduce your bill, and you earn points when you shop for even more discounts.  I know that everything I get here is fresh. And the inventory is changed out and rotated properly.  And they have a great selection of fresh fruits and vegetables.   They can be a little pricey on household stuff so I would suggest maybe going some where else for that, such as paper towels, soap and what have you...but you could probably spend $10 here and find enough food for breakfast lunch and dinner.   I usually go late, the are almost always not that busy, I have never had to wait in line, the self check outs are easy to use and staff is always super friendly and helpful.   Pretty much the only place I shop.

Per Shawns review above. I was with him when this happened. Really as a company how are you going to get the order wrong...and then not replace it after he paid for it...location should not matter.

This place gave me food poisoning on 1/5/2015. I have not been here in a while...now I know why...the only reason I went back because I wanted to try the new "All Natural Burger" So I got it as a low carb option...which means no bun...I also got the Lo carb Jalapeno burger.   First lets talk about price...All I got was the two burgers...NO drink...NO Fries...with no buns...so basically burgers wrapped in lettuce...$15.14...Rip OFF!!!!!   Seriously for the price I paid I could of bought a head of lettuce, the meat and all the fixings and fed a family of 6.   Secondly...this place is dirty...as I walked in, there were two Little Ceasers pizza boxes sitting on top of the bushes next to the Redbox dvd rental machines, along with a few empty drinking containers...and in general allot of trash. Once you get inside it's not much better.   I made my order, seriously almost shit myself when the girl told me the price. Thinking this better be the best burger I have ever eaten. The girl gave me my little table number tent and I then proceeded to sit down...most of the tables were dirty...not sure how they can't keep up on this stuff it was 8:40pm...and besides me there were only 3 other people in the building, a couple and what appeared to be a homeless guy in the back maybe drinking coffee.  My food was brought out on a tray by a girl...first thing I noticed is my napkin dispenser at the table is empty, so I had to get up to get them at another table...and the tray she brought it to me on was warped...so it didn't sit on the table flat...seriously why wouldn't you throw this thing out??   Let's talk about taste...the all natural burger...literally looked like a piece of flattened grilled dog food, and was so greasy...I mean like literally left a puddle of grease in my hamburger box... and it tasted bad...like it may of possibly been bad...but I thought to myself...maybe it was just because it was all natural. I was wrong...let's just say...the last few days I have been sick to my stomach felt like I was getting stabbed with razor blades and I had the worst fever. I am sure this food was the cause, it was all I had eaten that day, and all I had except for an iced tea from Starbucks.   I will never go back to this location. It's dirty on all accounts. Gross. Don't pay attention to the review below saying that this place is good, I honestly think that was written by someone that works there. So bad.   DON'T EVER GO HERE...EVER...you could die from food poisoning!

Ok...so don't go to the Filaberto's down the street on 32nd St. and Indian School drive the extra  mile and go here...This place is so so so much better.  Things that are must haves...any carne asada burrito...so good and they are huge...get the #15 on the menu it is so worth it, you get 2 carne asada burritos with beans and rice and a drink for like $10.  Important:::: And ask for the guacamole salsa, I believe it is exclusive to this location and might be the best thing ever invented. I always get extra to put in my eggs the next morning for breakfast. So good. ::::  The shrimp taco's here are bomb.com I mean...they are so frickin good, I could eat them everyday..  And lastly the piece of resistance is the carne asada super nachos...I don't care where you go this place has the best nachos in Phoenix. They give you a Styrofoam container heaped and I mean heaped with refried beans, rice, guac, sour-cream, carne asada and chips this thing is so big it could seriously choke a pig...this thing probably weighs in close to 5 pounds...this is not an exaggeration...I seriously need to weigh one of these one day.   This place is open 24 hours and I must say is my guilty pleasure, if your on a diet don't go here, but if its a cheat day and you are looking to indulge...dive in.   I love this place...

This place has been so many things over the years, I remember when it was Anderson's 5th Estate. I am glad Scottsdale has a comedy club that is bigger then the box they use to have inside the Venue of Scottsdale.   The people that perform here are pretty funny, you never go on a weekend were you wont find someone that will have you bent over in laughter, it is never just the headliner there is always accompanying acts and the owner seems to always tell a joke or two too that will have your sides hurting.   I always enjoy myself when I come here, the staff is pretty attentive, the main bouncer is on point and it's not overpriced at all. And the food and drinks are good.  The only reason I didn't give this place five stars is even thou I always get great seating when I am here...  I feel that the seating itself is a bit uncomfortable to be sitting in for 90 minutes watching a comedy routine. It's like sitting in at a Chamber of Commerce meeting in a small broke town, I feel the chairs even thou functional are from 1970's. If I am going to be sitting at a table top that is the size of an LP record at least give me a comfortable chair with some arm bars with some cushioning to sit in. Instead I feel like Chris Farley in Tommy Boy..."fat guy in a little coat"   Otherwise this place is great.  Definitely will be back.

So showed up here on a Saturday night, wearing a t-shirt and basketball shorts ready to bowl. Well to say the least I was denied entry due to my attire. When I asked to speak to a Manager they sent the Assistant Manager Rudy, who when I met him explained I was just here to bowl, I was not interested in going into Gypsy Bar. He said that it was "an UPSCALE bowling alley" and my attire was not acceptable. I could understand the dress code if I was some punk kid off the street. But I am 38 and I was with two friends who are also my age. When I explained to him that as a manager he should be able to make a managerial decision and let me slide. Being that I have worked in the industry for the last 20 years being a manager and a VIP host at some real UPSCALE venues...Cajun House of Blues, Cat Eye Lounge, and the GM of Jackrabbit Lounge in Scottsdale for 3 years, and am currently the Director of Operations at another Phoenix venue. He still declined. To say the least, he obviously has no concept of customer service, or how to make a decision that would probably be more beneficial to his business. We ended up going to Let it Roll Bowl. No dress code, no problems, and made the best of it. I will never go to this business again and per this review, suggest you don't either.

The greatest donut shop on the planet...and they are open 24 hours a day...so donuts at 5am before work, donuts for lunch, donuts for dinner, donuts after a drinkun night on the town. And the best bit of goodness you could ever have in your mouth.   My favorite is the buttermilk donut, it literally melts in your mouth, a sugary crisp outside with a soft buttermilk flavor on the inside, perfection in a donut.   Plus this place has breakfast sandwiches, and all kind of extras, more juice and drink selections then you could shake a stick at.   Mmmmmmm....donuts.

North...is Italian for the fucking bomb diggity!!!   So I shop at the Fresh and Easy across the street from this place and literally can walk here from my condo...to say the least I kept telling myself I was going to go for like the last few years...but had failed to do so...and since I am part Italian...I felt it almost an obligated duty to check this place out...so tonight on a whim, me and a gf went to see what all the fuss was about.   And to say the least..Woohoo! This is as good as it gets when it comes to Italian food. From start to finish, the service, the atmosphere, the food...it all was amazing.   We started out with the bruschetta...now this is not your Postino's type bruschetta...this is a do it your self sampler Chef's board bruschetta, with the freshest ingredients I have ever seen. Fresh made bread. Literally I think they made it all from scratch. I think they have some mad scientist in the back, churning fresh butter and making cheese along with growing the vegetables...I am not even kidding...almost filled up on this.  I am not a fan of olive's but my date said they were the best she has ever had. So so good.   For our main course I got the Chicken Pesto, so good...pesto pesto pesto if you like pesto this is it. Literally so much pesto even the chicken is green, smothered with pine nuts and parm cheese...literally melts in your mouth. She got the Chicken Parm. Simply Amazing...cooked to perfection. An as far as portion size...this thing was HUGE! We kept eating off each others plates...so good.   We decided if we get married North will be the place we go every year for our anniversary.   We both were so full, neither one of us even had room to try the desert.  But next time Gelato or Tiramisu for sure.  I have heard good things about this place, and am really glad we went. I heard it was pricey, but really it is not. Like $70 out the door for the two of us, and that included a few drinks and a standard 20% gratuity.   If you have not been here I would highly suggest giving it a try. So good, well worth it. Everything was excellent. Well done Fox Restaurant Concepts. Well done.

Ohso is probably one of my favorite spots to go to over in the Arcadia area. Tons of beers, great food, a friendly atmosphere and you can bring your dog. What more could you ask for.   I was recently there and had the shrimp tacos and a veggie burger. I can honestly say it was all delicious. I sat at the bar on the back patio I find myself sitting in the back patio area more then any other place here, I just find the back area more comfortable with open seating, and I can bring my puppy.  I like to watch sports on the Tv's and people watch. It always interesting to see people interact with other people and there pets.   I particularly like the Orange Blossom beer. I have to say it is one of the better brews they have on tap. I say I probably come here once a month at least.

Chipotle...translation...Chipotle...which means commercialized Mexican food in layman's terms. So as far as this goes I am a much bigger fan of Baja Fresh across the street and after this last experience at Chipotle I will probably continue to dine at the Baja Fresh location across the street. So I am have never been a huge fan of Chipotle, except for the fact that the portions are huge. What I am not a fan of is spending $10.18 on a single burrito and a tiny little bag of stale ass chips and day old salsa. I mean the burrito was filled mostly with beans and rice, the cost on that for them must be a whole 7 maybe 8 cents per portion. Ridiculous. I was not extremely impressed with Chipotle to begin with the novelty has worn off and so has the food taste. It's not good anymore. At least not at this location. Bland...not good for Mexican food.

So...I work in the club industry as a General Manager of another Scottsdale spot I have been in the Bar, Club and Entertainment scene for 18 years. I would expect more from the management at this place....to say the least the Manager Jeff at this place pretty much needs to take a step back in time and remember that we are in the hospitality industry.   So for the most part I have heard good things about this place that it was the new hot spot up north. Bigger then Spanish Fly and set up right.   Well this Sunday me and some friends decided we would check it out and decided we would get a cabana there now granted it was not under my name but it was me and my friends plan to go there and who ever got there first was going to get it.  My friends got there first. So I show up alone in casual dress some basketball shorts and a golf shirt and some nikes...on my way in I get stopped at the door, the bouncer explains to me I can not wear basketball shorts, I explained that me and my friends were getting a Cabana by the pool they were already inside and that I had no plan on hitting the pool with basketball shorts. I mean this is a Cantina Patio Bar & Restaurant right???   He still says he can't let me in. So then I pull the industry card, and explain that I am the G.M. of a club in Old Town Scottsdale and even though we have a dress code exceptions can be made usually for celebrities or for VIP's.   I would consider myself a VIP...since I work the scene I don't go out much but when I do I usually spend money...case in point last tab at El Hefe $200. The Mint $450. So it's not like I am a one or two drink type of customer I will usually buy a bottle or two.  I had already explained that I had a Cabana with friends waiting inside so one would assume that I am there to spend money.  So the bouncer says let me call the Manager Jeff. Who comes up and says pretty much the same thing and that if he were to make an exception for me someone would surely complain and it would not be fair and pretty soon everyone would be coming in out of dress code. Hello... It's a POOL BAR...dress code...really I can go shirtless...but my shorts are a problem...really??!   Good thing I wasn't hungry...I am assuming you must need to wear a suit jacket to sit down in the restaurant.  So to make a long story short, I went over to Kierland spent $75 on shorts at Tommy Bahama and went back and got let in.  I went in to check it out and meet my friends. Service sucked...had three different people walk by me at the bar when I first walked in before some nice girl finally saw that I had been waiting at least 10 minutes for a drink.  $8 for a Margarita in a 10oz plastic cup....really $8! Ridiculous!!!   Then I made my way over to the Cabana my friends were at.  To say the least they explained the Cabana was $300 bucks which seemed descent but after they heard what happened to me. They pretty much all said f*** this place and we packed up all our stuff and left. They had already spent about $160. We probably would have popped some bottles, I know I had planned on that before I got there. And we would of made a go of the place but the manager Jeff dropped the ball on this experience.  This is the hospitality industry buddy!!! To say the least I can guarantee you I will not be back to this location... in fact I would like to say I am boycotting all Old Town Group businesses but unfortunately I love sushi at Stingray Biltmore to much to do this. At least they got it right there! Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This place sucks on all levels.  The Wait. ALWAYS ALWAYS under staffed, they have one person running between the counter and the drive thru, and typically only one or two bankers to assist you. There is always a line. Plan on wasting no less then 15 minutes of you life if you walk in here. And there is always one girl sitting at the desk off to the left when you walk in that seems oblivious to everything around her.   The staff seems to be always changing the only person that seems to stay at this place is the manager and they are never very helpful if you have a problem with fees or anything for that matter. I feel like they treat you like your a second class citizen if you don't have a million dollars in your bank account with them. This branch can never help me, even thou they are closer to me now, then my old branch because I didn't open my account at this branch I have to handle most disputes at the branch I opened my account at. Ridiculous policy in general.    To get in and out of this place is a nightmare, the parking lots bad. Not very many open spots and they are narrow if you drive a truck prepare to be dinged.    It took them forever to actually get an ATM that does cash deposits, which are suppose to hit your account instantaneously...they don't.   I had a Safety Deposit box here at one time, huge hassle, like $48 a year. Ridiculous, and due to the fact they are always under staffed, always took forever to get to it, someone isn't available or don't know what they are doing or don't have the key. Removed it after the first year.   Service at this location is so bad, that I recently opened an account at Desert Schools, if I didn't have so many things linked to my accounts at US bank, I would have closed it down a long time ago. Worst bank ever.

I'm a fan of the flame broiled whopper, and I am a fan of Burger Kings coupons but I typically don't eat fast food. But I happen to get some coupons in the mail and Saturday is my "cheat" day so I said why not. I could go on my lunch break I work on Saturday's and this location is right down the street from my office.   So on 3/14/15 12:43pm I get a 30 minute lunch break and I tell myself me and another co-worker will go. To say the least I was not happy with most of this experience. Let me go over the negatives, because the positives are listed above.   1. The restaurant was dirty. The counter was dirty, tables were dirty, the soda machine was dirty, the condiment area was dirty. I don' know what drive thru looked like because I went inside, but I will say there was only one group of people sitting down and only about 6 people in line in front of me...dirty is gross.  2. It took forever for the check out girl to ring every one up, she kept asking for assistance, or was just generally joking with her coworkers...took me 5 minutes to get there, stood in line for 10 minutes...I finally get to order. MY BREAK IS HALF OVER.   3. I order. I had a coupon for two original chicken sandwiches and two small fry for $4.99, not a bad deal, didn't feel like a burger that day. I wait. I get it for there...I figure I can get it and sit and eat real fast and wont have to go back to work and eat at my desk.  I watch as my order clock goes up to 9 minutes. FML. Then when my order is up I spend another three minutes looking at it sit under the heat lamps while the staff talks amongst themselves and works on drive thru orders that came in after mine. Finally its put on a tray and given to me. I ask for a cup for water, the girl didn't hear me because she is not paying attention, I ask again, she looks it me like its a hassle to hand me a clear plastic cup for water...I am getting extremely frustrated.   My break is effectively over.   4. I finally get my food. The french fries were good. But how can you fuck up french fries??? The chicken tasted like it was freezer burnt, it was gross.   So after effectively wasting a good 25 minutes I actually get my food after walking in the front door of this Burger King.  I used my entire break and went back to work extremely late.   Worst so called FAST FOOD experience ever.   I will never go back to this location. And I threw out the rest of the coupons I had.

This is where I go to get the best deals on Men's clothes compared to anywhere else in the valley. Better then Ross, better then TJ Maxx, better then Last Chance. Hands down, you will find good men's clothing here of all sizes for a descent price, I am a big guy I wear 3x shirts, and they have a pretty good selection here, I always walk out finding what I need.  I also have purchased allot of other items here that you will not find cheaper any where else period. I come here at least once a month, every time I wish I had more money to spend the deals cant be beat...and they have lay a way...Seriously Lay a Way! So cool. The store is clean and the staff always seems friendly and helpful. Now if I could just taser all the little hood rat kids running around this place would get 5 stars, but apparently they frown upon tasing children that are not yours in this establishment...don't ask me how I know I just know.

What can I say about this place...Hmmm...how can I put this... Sausage Festival.  A strip club where the girls just wear slutty lingerie and don't get naked but still act like dick teases. A want to be Hooters.   So I am not sure what is going on in here...I mean if you like to watch sports in a bar...yea...they got that going for them, that and Ice Cold cheap tap beer that's why they get two stars.  Not really anything on the menu that is very healthy, If you want straight junk bar food than yea they got that too....the decor makes no sense, you got girls wearing next to nothing, Ugg boots, and then have a bunch of taxidermy on the walls...not sure what the hell is going on in here. And god help the lighting...its like walking into the sun, I assume they do this so the middle aged perverts that frequent this place don't try to get handsy with the barely legal waitresses.  And this place is over priced, besides the bar, everything here is about $2 $3 more expensive then most other places serving the same menu items and the quality is generally shit.    I would go here to watch a game once in a while, but most game days, there is a line out the door. And for special events like fight night they want to charge a cover to get in like there a god damn night club. Ridiculous.

This place was recommended to me by a friend, I had never been but have always wanted to go, I had driven by 100 times and seen a ton of people on the outdoor patio and I love a good burger, and this place supposedly has one of the best in the country..."The Ivan" $13.00...to say the least I was not impressed. I have had better burgers at pretty much every other place around here, OHSO, Delux, Christ even the Chicago hamburger company down the streets sliders tasted better as far as I am concerned. Myself and my gf came on a Sunday afternoon, as I was walking up the stairs I stepped in a huge piece of fresh gum, obviously some uncultured swine that had just frequented the place must of spit this out, to say the least it was pretty gross, it took a minute to scrape off the bottom of my shoe, and was not the best start to my experience...we walked in and the bar was moderately busy... and all the tables were taken, I am not sure if there is suppose to be a hostess, there was no one around so we decided to seat our selves on the patio, to what seemed to be dismay of our server. She was horrible. Dulce. Poor attitude and not very friendly. Had to get up to ask for drink refills, also seemed like there was a huge issue with asking to turn the misters on outside, they turned them on and then a few minutes later turned them off, where I had to ask to turn them back on again it was just over 100 outside.  It took forever for our food to come out. On appearance alone the Ivan which probably stands close to 6 inches high looks pretty impressive, but taste wise...I was really not impressed. My Gf had the same thing...she too was not impressed, and she did not finish hers. The fries were mediocre...and as I said in general so was this experience here. Probably will never go back.

Do not go here...for the love of baby Jesus avoid this place like the plague, or you might actually get the plague from Baby JeZeus working in the kitchen.  NO joke.   So on my Dine IN receipt I kid you not they don't even list the address of this location, I am assuming to prevent reviews like this one on yelp. I had to get my car worked on and this place was the closet thing in the vicinity that looked like it might be sanitary... I was wrong...it's not sanitary.  So I ate inside...let's talk about fast food. I ordered 4 things, a meal and a meat lovers burrito. Lets talk about the time it took...almost 10 minutes just to get my food, in the meantime I see drive-thru orders whipping out ahead of mine, that came in well after mine did.  The counter girl apologized she could see  I was visibly upset on the delay, at least give me my orange juice dummy.  The place is DIRTY. There were several people just sitting in here, and I noticed that after sitting there for a  moment I realized they were just waiting for the bus stop out front and not actual customers, some of them looked as if they were homeless, also I saw several people just come in off the street and use the bathroom. I can only assume by the filth of this place, all the tables were dirty, that they have probably had a heroin OD in the bathroom here. It is on Van Buren.  The FOOD. Or should I say BARF. My burritos were gross, I have had better burritos from a street vendor, and I am not talking a nice work truck street vendor, I am talking the people at the Walmart parking lot on 44th street and Thomas selling tamales and burritos better...that only happened once but they were still better then the puke they serve here...my hash brown was not a light golden brown but a dark rancid grease soaked brown, only solidifying the fact that this place probably hasn't cleaned the fryer grease in over a week...just Gross.  I am just happy I didn't get food poisoning from this place and no one shanked me at my table as I tried to ingest this horrible food from this poor excuse for a franchise. Don't go here ever.

Came here tonight for a smoothie...it was good, the place was clean the staff was friendly  and they were open late. Sweet. 4 stars...only reason they didn't get 5, I thought they might be closed. Poorly lit up at night compared to most of the other shops in that area.

If you love good pizza and face it who doesn't...then Giant Rustic Pizza is probably for you.   I have eaten in here and today I got my order to go.   They are fast, it never takes long, my take out today was ready in less then 15 minutes for pick up. The ingredients always taste like they are fresh you can tell allot of this stuff isn't coming out of a pre-frozen bag like the commercial places and if it is they are taking good care of it with proper storage techniques.    Today I got the Sunday/Monday Special a large 3 topping pie and a dozen wings for just over $20. I think out the door with taxes it was like $24. As my gf put it...we smashed it!!! LOL!  The pizza was good, we ordered a pepperoni sausage and extra cheese pie.  It didn't seem like they went very hefty on the extra cheese I ordered but regardless the pizza was still pretty good. The wings were really good, not sure why they put the sauce on the side, I would of preferred the wings were tossed with the sauce...and they could of been cooked maybe another 1 or 2 minutes in my opinion. They were done...but think they could maybe used another minute to get a little more done.  But we still smashed them so no complaints. LOL.  We have been there before thou...when you go inside to eat you can get pizza by the slice if you choose, and its not like Little Caesars were its been sitting under a heat lamp, it's fresh and you can put your choice of toppings on it. I will say this about that though...if you go nuts on toppings you might as well get a pie. Toppings can be kind of pricey, but typically you can 2 pepperoni slices for around $5.   As far as the ambiance goes..its cool...seems like it could use a bit brightening up... the place is a little small, I definitely wouldn't go there for a large birthday party, but considering there is a Baskin Robbins next door...it could be a fun little date.    Would of given this place 5 stars if they had a tiny bar and were open a little later.   I have never done delivery from this place so I can not speak to that, but I would like it more if this place were open later...a good late night pizza joint is hard to come by...especially one that delivers. I think they should stay open till at least midnight on Friday and Saturday instead of 10pm. In general I think they should be open later...but that's me.

So, I called this place about a battery I had bought here that was no longer working. Receipt said 72 month exchange, the gentlemen on the phone I talked to said go ahead and bring it in we will swap it out for you. You just have to pay the difference on an exchange, I asked how much he said depends but probably no more then $50. So I come in the next day with the battery and the girl behind the counter says we have to test it first. I ask how long will this take? She says 2 hours. WTF. 2 hours to test a dead battery. I say ok fine. I will come back. So I call to see whats up...while driving...20 minutes later on the phone...still can't tell me what the price is for the exchange...at this point I have driven to the location. After having to wait in line, even though I was just on the phone with this girl...she proceeds to tell me the swap price is $8 more then what I originally paid for the battery. Originally paid $100.22, the exchange rate was $108.67!!!!! How the fuck is that an exchange under the 72 month warranty higher, You are charging me more for the battery then I originally paid. Then she played dumb, and was like that's what the system says we don't change anything, I feel like this girl was an idiot and maybe forgot a step or two...Was like you just wasted an hour out of my life with your stupidity. She was like you get $15 for the core exchange, I told her to keep the battery and her $15 bucks. I found it for $30 cheaper at Napa right down the street on Thomas. Fuck O'reilly! Will never shop here again. RIP OFF.

Ok...so I have been to this location about 5 times to handle multiple different DMV transactions. The staff at this place is can be extremely rude, especially the chubbier female long haired brunette who claims she is a manager. She argued with me about what I could and could not do at this location. Even thou I had been there multiple times to handle the same thing. I feel they make up their own rules as they go. I buy cars at auction and use these places all the time. After the way I got treated here this last time. I would never go here again.  Ever!

I think this place is confused. I am not sure what the theme is here, it reminds me of a taco shop in San Diego, but I am not sure if they think they are a sports bar a fast food place or a restaurant. So lets go into that a little bit further.   So sports bar...the place has about 9 or 10 TVs...9 or 10 TVs that all should have been bigger in my opinion. They are all about I want to say about 40 inch TV's they should have gone a bit bigger, unless your sitting right below one, you really can't see what's on it with any discernment. And if you are sitting below one you have to look almost straight up, which makes for an uncomfortable experience. They were playing the NFL network, about the only reason this place even gets one star...but you couldn't even read the ticker on the bottom of the screen from across the isle...so in my opinion they went to small with the TV's.   The beer menu...they don't have one!!!??? The counter girl couldn't tell me what they had off hand really but did know it was happy hour and rattled off some 3 odd tap beers. PBR, Coors, and some other garbage swill...not impressed.  I wandered over to the bar area, they have a full bar, but might have gone a bit overkill with it, maybe they think their a nightclub?! I ended up ordering a Corona...12 Oz Corona $4.25 outrageous price. Happy hour at Sushi Brokers 22oz Corona $6. Better deal and its a sushi place, so literally $4.25 considering they are paying about .80 cents a piece for them is outrageous. Overpriced beer, plus the Corona tasted a bit stale, it was cold, but it seemed like it was maybe heated and then cooled one too many times. No good.   Fast food place or restaurant...you decide!!??   The seating is general seating, you walk in and walk up to the counter like its a fast food place, the menu is above your check out girl, pretty easy to read, lots of suggestions. I ordered the Chicken Fajita Burrito. THIS COMES WITH NOTHING. Chips and salsa are additional. So Chips Salsa and the beer with burrito...$14.25...where am I? Tee Pee's, Manuel's, Macayo's...with these prices I feel I should be sitting at a table and should have a waiter, not seating myself.   On a separate note, I never actually was given a receipt ever...showing me prices...HUGE RED FLAG...I only got a food ticket to show what I ordered.  So they give you a buzzer chip like the ones you get at a Cheese Cake factory and tell you when your food is ready to go to the counter and get it. OK...so about 10 minutes go by and mine goes off. Not to bad a return time, but granted it was slow considering I was the only one in the building, besides staff and this was 5pm on Friday by the way. So I walk up to grab it and get a look in the kitchen. It's dirty!!!  I mean real dirty, this place was dead but the grill looked like it had been cooked on for a party of 500, it definitely hadn't been cleaned in a minute. Not sure if I really want my customers to see that...they are definitely not True Food, even thou their prices reflect that they want to be.   So I sit down, a bit hesitant already. On the plus side the burrito is a descent size, not as big as Chipolte but bigger then Taco Bell. And it tastes OK, not great not worth $8. Chips and salsa...chips are just OK nothing to write home about, definitely had better...the Salsa...actually was pretty amazing...but they give you a huge basket of chips with one cup of salsa, not enough salsa, to many chips. So I go up to the counter and ask for more salsa. $1.29!! I also ask for some guacamole. $2.49. So almost $4.00 extra for this. My check is now almost $20!!!   I have to go back up to the kitchen counter to get it, once again this gives me time to look into the kitchen on how dirty it is. Gross. So here is the kicker thou...I get my Guacamole...charged me 3 times as much a Chipolte would or any other place for that matter. Best part, my little cup is only part guacamole, when I get to the bottom of the cup, its filled with shredded lettuce, so your not quite getting a full cup worth of guacamole, their shorting you and adding a filler. It's a rip off.   So to top off my fast food experience, as its apparent I have to put my own dishes away in a little tub above the trash along with your basket and tray. As I am doing this, some girl comes in off the street goes to the counter and asks the girl for a donation for her dead brother or something in exchange for some candy...and of course she makes a beeline for me being the only customer in the joint, and yes hits me up too. Not my idea of a good dining experience in any circumstance anywhere.  So I would give this place a half star for having the NFL network on...that's about it. But once again no half star system on yelp.  But I would not suggest going here, being in the restaurant and hospitality industry for almost 20 years, I don't expect this place to be open very long unless they make some serious changes. Not worth the experience, there is no novelty. Don't go.

So this is a corporate company. So it might be different in your city. But this is from Phoenix Arizona, I am using Yelp as a forum to complain.  I went to a comedy show at Stand Up Live on 8/30/2014 at City Scape in the West Garage. They allow you 3 hours of parking validation. We checked in at 9:43pm. Well the comedy show we went to started 30 minutes late, and then after the show we had to wait in a line to get out of the garage for another 30 to 45 minutes, by the time we got up to the gate, it was 1:22am and I explained that the only reason we went pass the 3 hours was due to the fact that the show started late and we had been sitting in line for over a half hour waiting to get to this gate to get out, the gentleman was rude said he didn't care, we were past the limit and had to pay. 39 minutes over and only because of the circumstances, mostly just sitting in a line waiting to get out of the garage. It was only $3. But on a matter of principal alone, this is just poor business. I would rather park on the street then give this company another dime of my money. Let this be the first boycott of Lanier Parking nationwide. The dude in the box is lucky I didn't drive my Ford Expedition thru the gate or thru his box, but I didn't want to scratch the paint on my truck...so yea he definitely lucked out.

This is in my neighborhood so I figured I had seen a bunch of friends posting pictures of crab legs and what not on instagram. So I thought me and the gf would check it out.   So lets just say it was not what I expected. It was extremely busy about a 15 minute wait, this was around 9pm on a Friday night, I would almost suggest going later to miss the end of the happy hour crowd. They take your number and text you when your table was ready, but I never got the text, they just came out and called for me when our table was ready. I would highly suggest if your going to go on a weekend night to call and reserve so you don't have to wait. And this place is loud, you can barely hear the person across the table from you, I would not say it is a good place to bring kids, or for intimate conversations. Most of the crowd was couples and groups of young people eating dinner, very few families, and allot of the area hipsters hanging out at the bar.   So my gf got the pulled pork Sammich and I got the alligator basket we both got gumbo. The gumbo was good, I know they use bay leaves in the cooking process but I wish that they would strain them out before serving it. I just don't like them. Nothing like biting into a big old bay leaf. But otherwise the gumbo was pretty good, served hot, but I would have preferred whole pieces of sausage and shrimp, it seems like the sausage was chopped up to small pieces and the shrimp was in pieces too, I never quite got a whole one. All in all it was very good and served piping hot, It comes in like a plastic Tupperware type serving dish so you can put a cap on it and take it to go if you want.   My alligator was seasoned quite well, but it was a bit fried too long, which dried it out and it was a bit disappointing, when you fry alligator, they need to be more flash fried when cooking it, alligator is a white meat, and it doesn't hold moisture well so if you over fry it, it dries out quite a bit, that's what happened to mine anyhow. This place would of got 5 stars if it was not for that. Overall the the food was good, the Cajun fries were heavily seasoned, was not to big of fan of the potato salad, should maybe try the coleslaw next visit.   The service was good, our server Cassie was very informative, and was sure to keep checking on us and made sure our beverages were kept full. I wish she would have offered to give us a marker I would have like to put some graffiti on the walls like most other people appeared to do. I am a fan will definitely come back soon for the crab or lobster. I suggest giving it a try.

Sushi station oh sushi station how you afford me to eat my favorite sushi on a budget.  Let me count the way I love thee... Ok so first off, this place has a unique concept, sushi is made and then sent out on a conveyer belt on different color plates which denote the prices. Typically about 4 pieces per plate. What's neat about this place, especially if you go with a group is that it allows you to sample quite a bit of sushi types by barely spending anything individually. I have been here at least a half dozen times at this point, and should technically have my picture on the wall I have checked in so many times on Belly.  The place is always clean and usually has a descent crowd, I don't really like sitting at the bar and prefer one of the booths off to the right side when you come in, you get first dibs if you sit over there on all the fresh stuff being put on the conveyer.  Service has always been good, If you get a chance ask to sit in Tom's section, this guy is on point, always makes sure your drinks are full and is pretty knowledgeable if you have questions. I always spend at least $50 here every time I go. It's hard not to, between two people. There is just to much good stuff to try.  This isn't your typical sushi bar...but if you like sushi and don't want to wait, this is the spot to go, sushi is ready as soon as you take  a seat...can't beat that. Everything you need is at your table, chop sticks, soy, all the server needs to bring is just drinks and wasabi.  I will be back, since it opened I am here at least 2 times a month.

So...I hadn't noticed that this place had changed from Revo burrito to MEXX 32, I knew it was under construction, but finally went here on Saturday night, I was going to go to Delux, but it was pretty packed so we walked over here, we just wanted a few cocktails.   So as we sat and enjoyed our complimentary chips and salsa over a beer and a strawberry daiquiri, and we admired how nicely this place was put together, very upscale, plenty of room and seating. And clean. good music, great atmosphere. A pleasant experience all around.   So it got even better when the owner Lenny dropped by our table to ask how everything was, I have met Lenny several times thru out the years when I worked for 944 magazine and Destination.tv and we reviewed and frequented Zen 32. We had a nice conversation with Lenny where he explained that things are going very well and he was extremely happy with the turn out so far, they have not even had the grand opening yet.  We had already eaten at Ra, earlier in the evening so we were not really hungry but Lenny said we should try the street taco's if we had the chance.  We tried them, we got the sampler plate and tried three different taco's and we really enjoyed them, I particularly enjoyed the Mushroom tacos, something a little different but very very good.   I live within walking distance of this place. So I can't wait to make this one of my new favorite haunts.  The bar is great and has a huge selection of tequilas.   Lenny has hit a home run with this concept, I think it is going to do very well and I will definitely be back with friends.
