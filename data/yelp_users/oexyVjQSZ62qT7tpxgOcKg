I have never been to a race track before so when I saw a Livingsocial deal for this place I thought I'd try it out. It was the best $30 I ever spent! We sat in the Turf Club which I guess is the nicest viewing area. There wasn't a bad table in the place, even the 2 tops which is what we had. The menu is mostly lunch type items, salad, sandwiches, burgers, with a few breakfast options, but the food was surprisingly good and very reasonably priced. I had the tuna melt and it was stuffed with tuna salad and cheese. The BF had the chicken caprese sandwich. The sandwich arrived, I looked up a second later and it was gone. He inhaled it,  he thought it was that good. The bread pudding was ok. The only thing that wasn't awesome was the service. Our waitress was very slow to come around and she didn't have much of a personality. Any time we needed anything I had to flag her down but who knows it could have been an off day for her. We walked around and went to the grandstand and outside viewing area as well. There are stadium type food booths and a couple of bars out there and it looked fun. We would definitely go back again and pay the full price. So worth it.

I can sincerely agree with all of the nice things written in the other reviews. The owner did my estimate, the work was quality and they were done earlier than originally promised. They really helped me out of a bind. When our first painter never showed up to do the work we only had a week until we moved in and were on a very strict timetable. I was contacted quickly and they were able to meet my deadline. Greatly appreciated!

I will drive across town to go to other Trader Joe's so that I do not have to go to this location again. The non refrigerated produce is mostly organic. I think it is great that TJ's offers so many organic options but I personally choose not to buy organic. Hate me if you want to, I don't care, but if you are giving the option of choosing organic then I should have the option not too. By not carrying a large selection of non organic vegetables I am forced to buy them, at a higher price mind you, or doing without. I noticed the same with the meat. I understand that this location is space challenged but I do not appreciate having to purchase the more expensive product because management has made the decision not to carry the basics. The second complaint I have is that they have a few register lanes but usually only 1 or 2 are open and they just let the lines build up without opening any more. My third complaint is that the last time I was there I bought a reusable bag but not all of my groceries would fit in it so I had to use the paper bags. I did not double bag them and I packed them full to the brim except for the last one. The last bag had about 4 delicate items in it and the cashier, an elderly woman with gray hair, had the nerve to take them out of the bag, put them on top of my other packed bags and fold the bag up and put it away. Seriously? I spent over $100 and I'm begrudged 1 paper bag? Come on!

I've lost all faith in Trader Joe's at this point. They are supposed to be all about the customer experience but I guess that's not profitable anymore. I sent an email to customer service and even though it says I will receive and email back, I never did. Apparently my experience is the norm and negative shopping experiences do not get acknowledged or addressed.

We moved from the North East, and because of the nature of our move, had to take the apartment sight unseen which can be scary if you start reading these review websites. When we arrived, the apartment was just like in the pictures! It is beautiful, the rooms are a good size as are the bathrooms and the kitchen is huge. The pools are clean and there are gas grills for community use. There are also charcoal grill areas all around the complex if you don't want to go to the pool. The office is staff is extremely friendly and helpful and any maintenance issue are taken care of immediately (we've only had minor things like batteries in smoke alarms needing changed).  There are a lot of children living in the complex but I think it is because there are 2 or 3 really good schools a block away. The location is pretty good as well. You are literally 2 minutes from the 17 and 101 and anything you could possibly need is 5 minutes away including Target, a movie theater, and Waffle House! The company that owns the complex offers several perks and you can pay your rent on line which is very cool.

First off, a whole star for having Layer Cake Primitivo. Second, a whole star for a carafe of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo for 15 bucks!!! Oh and yeah, the pizza was really good too! Apparently, they have a scientific way of replicating Brooklyn water to make the crust authentic. Whatever they are doing it is working. I was sad to see that no one was in the place on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon. We had the entire restaurant to ourselves but the music was great, think old school Frank and Dino, and the decor was complete with red checkered table cloths.  Please go to this location during the day, they totally need it and it is worth the have a "private serving."

The evening started off as a 2.5 star experience. We had a reservation (which I recommend if you are planning on going on a weekend night) but we wanted to get there early for happy hour.  The bar was packed as was to be expected but we were able to find a ledge with chairs at it. The bf went to the bar to order and a large, loud bartender took the order and rudely asked "where are you even seated?" The bf pointed to our perch and the bartender replies " uh,  we have servers who are taking care of tables. They're a little busy right now but someone will come around!" Ok sorry jerk no need to scold us. We had no idea there was a server or we would have just waited for one instead of inconveniencing you! Anyway, the server comes, we tell her what we ordered, asked her to keep the tab open and ordered a Sweet Chili Calamari. She comes back a few minutes later with our credit card receipt already run and no calamari on it. We finished the round and I flagged her down again. I ordered another round and asked if she put our order in for the calamari. She had not and seemed put out that  we had to reopen the  tab even when we specifically told her to keep it open. The place was pretty chaotic. The hour we were at the bar we were brought another table's food twice and staff were running everywhere.  This is were they start to increase in stars. The calamari was some of the best I've ever eaten. The sauce wasn't too sweet, the peppers were pickled and not too hot and the batter was light and airy. We were seated at a very large booth and were greeted by a very friendly and down to earth server, Nicole I think. The wine selection is very good and they have a variety of prices which is nice. You can order 100 by the glass but there were some very good bottles in the $35-$40 range. The BF had the peppercorn NY strip, I had the bone in ribeye, and we shared the half and half (frites and onion rings) and asparagus. I've been to Del Frisco's in Manhattan. The steak I had there was seriously THE BEST thing I have ever put in my mouth! It is the steak that all other steaks have to live up to. My ribeye was almost as good and $20 cheaper, every time I think about it my mouth starts to water. The BF enjoyed his just as much and randomly brings it up, apparently his is haunting him as well. Both steaks were cooked perfectly and well marbled. The sides were more than enough for the 2 of us, but being the gluttons that we are, we ate everything but 1 lonely onion ring. The service was on point. She came by at the exact moments that we needed her but left us alone the rest of the time. Total bill including the bar tab was about $200, which I think is reasonable for the amount and quality of what we had. We had several cocktails, an appetizer, 2 large, succulent steaks, 2 sides, and a bottle of Malbec. There are so many other steak houses that we want to try in the area that I don't think we'll go back but it is definitely an experience I will tell all my friends about! *obviously*

I have to say that this is some of the best BBQ I have ever had! The price is very reasonable as well, especially for the amount of food you are given. The BF and I shared the "Whole Hog" platter. We finished it, but only because we're gluttons and don't believe in wasting food. It was enough for at least 3 people. The meat just fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. I also appreciate that it wasn't smothered in sauce. They give you the opportunity to actually taste the meat but give you extra sauce on the side if you want it. We had the mac and cheese - gooey and scrumptious and the corn - roasty. The cocktails were tasty and also reasonably priced. We were there on a Saturday night with a party of 14. I don't know if we had a reservation but we were seated pretty quickly. We could tell that they were busy and even though we were taking up a lot of precious space they never  made us feel rushed. The waitress was a doll! Being a large group we didn't all arrive at the same time, needed separate checks, and needed drinks at different times. She didn't miss a beat and everything was accurate on our bill. If you check in on Yelp you get 10% off that visit and you can register for their mailings on their website and they'll send you a coupon for a free onion block appetizer.  There is a club attached to the restaurant but it is pretty bizarro. I wouldn't recommend hanging out there after your dinner. It isn't a honky tonk but a CLUB club for the locals. It doesn't really fit with the restaurant but whatever more power to them using the space to make some money. Apparently every table in the club is sold out every Saturday night so good for them. I forgot the mention the donuts. If you are too full to eat them after your meal, as we were, take them with you! I sincerely regret not bringing them home to be eaten at a later time.

Best kept secret (well I guess not any more) of the West Side. This is a no frills type of place but it is clean and they do excellent work. Everyone who works there is very nice and it is always the same employees, no revolving door for sure. I have small nail beds and very thin nails. Before I found Lemy Nails, I was never able to keep the acrylic tips on, they always lifted or broke. Since finding Lemy, I have never had a nail break or come off in the entire year I have been getting them done here! The prices are also extremely reasonable. Especially since the quality of work is so high.

I can't believe how awesome our floors look. We never sealed the grout when we moved in, I know shame on us, and after 2 years it was filthy. To be completely honest, I didn't have high hopes for the results and now it looks like it did when we moved in. It is unbelievable! We were able to get an appointment on the day we needed it and they arrived on time. I was even called when they were about 30 mins out. They guys that came were very nice and they worked really fast. We will definitely use them the next time we do our carpets.

Terrible. We were so hungry when we got here and ended up waiting over 20 mins for 2 sandwiches. We are 1 of 2 tables. My Italian sub has 3 slices of meat on it and my husband's fries are limp and leaked grease. We're still hungry and headed to a drive thru.

The fish they use is high quality, you can see and taste it but that is about it for positive comments. We went on the 1st Friday of Lent and the place was packed. We saw a 2 top table at the bar so we grabbed it. The table was greasy and dirty, complete with a dollop of tartar sauce smack dab in the middle. The miserable bartender sluggishly came over and took our order. I guess we had to run a tab since we were sitting in the bar area bc she took our credit card when we ordered. No big deal except she when she brought it back she slapped it down right on top of the tartar sauce spill left on the center of the table. She either didn't notice or didn't care that the table was filthy bc she never wiped it down for us and she was so ornery looking we were afraid to ask her to do it for us. We were not in a crazy hurry to eat but the people around us were getting restless. Apparently, some of them had been waiting for over an hour for their order. Now, I try to be as understanding as possible but seriously? It doesn't take that long to fry fish. The nasty bartender just replied to the complaining customers that the kitchen got slammed with orders and it was taking a long time. No apology just an excuse. Ok, I get it ,they got hit with a bunch of orders at once. They were busy, I understand,  it was the first Friday of Lent but of course they were busy!!!! It is a fish restaurant on the 1st Friday of Lent! One would think that the owners would have planned their staffing a bit differently. We got our food and the bf loved his but mine was cold. On the way to the bathroom, I nearly slid to my death on a smashed french fry  or "chip" because none of the staff bothered to pick it or any of the other trash up off the floor. The bathroom is locked and you have to get a key (on a hanger) from the cashier. What kind of legit restaurant locks their bathroom like a gas station? The place is disgusting, the service is terrible, and the food is inconsistent. I don't think we'll be making a follow up trip to the Codfather.

Coming from living on the East Coast (NJ, MA, CT) and actually having pizza from the real Grimaldi's under the bridge I had high hopes. I was seriously disappointed. We got a pie with Italian sausage, onions and roasted red peppers and it had absolutely no flavor. The sausage had no zing, the sauce was just there to make the crust soggy and the cheese was presumably there just for texture since it had no taste. I would almost rather have a store bought frozen pizza before I would go back to Grimaldi's and I'm sad that I cheated on my diet with their pizza.

I thought I needed new brakes and was considering going to cookie cutter brake place until I read the mostly negative reviews on Yelp. I searched a little harder and came up with Honest -1 Auto Care and boy am I glad I did! I brought my car in and described the noise. Michael, the Service Manager, said they could take a look at it and even offered me a ride home. I didn't have anything else to do so I opted to wait. About 20 minutes later, I was informed that there was nothing wrong with my car and it needed no work. Has that ever happened at any other car place ever?!?! There is always something wrong even if there isn't anything wrong. They didn't even charge me to look at it. The following week I took the BF's car in also for brakes. He did actually need them replaced and they gave me a reasonable estimate and completed the work in less than 2 hours. We will continue to bring both our cars back for regularly scheduled maintenance or any necessary work that may be needed in the future. On a side note, if you have to wait they have made it very comfortable to do so. There is a children's play area, coffee, bottled water, a nice tv, a pc but they also have wifi if you want to bring your own lap top.

I happened upon this place via a search in Yelp. It thought it was a good sign that it had so many reviews and was still highly rated. I called on Thursday and was able to get an appointment on Saturday. It was a good thing too because my roots were getting so long I was contemplating going back brunette. I really enjoyed my stylist, Rocky, and I left I was blonde again. I also had really big hair which normally I wouldn't go for but I was kinda feeling it so I left it. Calling it "big" was actually an understatement but I am from the South and we like big hair there and as I have heard many times before "The bigger the hair the closer to God" so I figured I could use all the help I could get. The staff at the front desk were friendly and welcoming and also suggested products for me to buy. Many people don't like to be sold on things but I do. I spent most of my life in sales and customer service so I appreciate a little add on if it is necessary. The  facility is huge! They are a full service salon offering, not only hair, but tanning, nails and spa services. I look forward to going back again and trying some of them out.

We went to this place at 6 pm on a Friday and it was EMPTY. I have no idea why! The happy hour, especially on Friday, is amazing! The food was good and the drinks were creative and well made. They have a bacon wrapped hot dog! I think I can end my review there.

My husband and I are big Restaurant Impossible fans. We live across town but have been wanting to visit this place since we saw the episode and it is the only location the show has filmed that was even remotely close to where we live. We were greeted as soon as we entered and given our choice of seating. Initially, when we watched the show I remember thinking it looked better before the renovation but the decor was very nice. Our server had a great personality and chatted with us a bit, smiling the whole time. We ordered the Italian Meat Plate. It was so big we could of had just that for dinner! It was seriously an appetizer built for 6. I had the Veal Piccata with a side of vegetables. You could tell the vegetables were fresh not frozen. My husband had a pizza. At first I thought maybe we should send it back so the cheese could be melted better but when I tasted it I understood why they served it that way. It was really fresh and light and I really got a taste of all the ingredients. At the end of the meal, Maria came out to ask us how everything was. We were very happy to report we loved everything! We even thought the prices were very reasonable, especially compared to the portions. In the past, we've been disappointed by restaurants that the "magic of television" has coaxed us into trying but not this time. If we didn't love so far away we'd definitely go back. Oh and I forgot to mention, if you buy a bottle of wine and don't finish it you can take it home with you. What a great perk!

You really do "gotta go go to Lo Lo's!" Just follow the dancing chicken leg you won't be disappointed. Seriously though, some of the best Southern food I have ever eaten, you know, aside from my grandmother's who was born and raised in North Carolina and wasn't stingy with the bacon grease when cooking. They clearly use quality ingredients and make everything from scratch, you can taste it! I highly recommend the collard greens, fried okra, and especially the banana pudding! The fries were good too but you have so many other choices for sides that you just can't get  anywhere else so go with one of those options. The service was also fabulous! Our server was very polite and his face must hurt so bad by the end of the shift because he never stopped smiling. You should go just for the novelty of asking "What types of Kool Aid are you serving today?"

This place was great! They have a large selection of meats and  sides. I went with the beef/lamb combo while the Hub's went with the traditional strip meat (sorry I don't know what it is called) and both were flavorful and delicious. The vegetables on them were crisp and fresh. I had the salad as a side and it was almost large enough to be an entrée and, to our pleasant surprise, the French fries my husband had were hand cut! The prices are super reasonable and they have beer, always an added bonus.

"I had a pleasant experience at the gyno today" said no one ever. Although not always the most comfortable or easy appointment to go to this office made it way bearable. You fill out all your info online before you go, which is pretty cool. I was shocked to be taken at almost the exact time of the appointment and even more taken aback that the doctor actually had a face to face conversation with me before I even had to get undressed. Then instead of a flimsy paper cover and robe they give you cloth ones. The staff is very friendly and the doctor was knowledgeable and easy to talk to. I highly recommend this office and Dr. Phil Harmon.

Please excuse this review as I am writing it as I come to from my food coma. We just moved to Phoenix and at the time of dining we were not familiar with the Fox Restaurant Group. We happened upon CD on accident on a Tuesday night. I must say the place was pretty hoppin' for an early week night. We ordered the pretzels with fondue, the fried chicken and the steak. It was so good we didn't even speak to each other through the entire sitting. It was the kind of meal you don't mind having indigestion after because you get the pleasure of re tasting the deliciousness. Gross, I know, but you know what I'm talking about! The server we had was as good as a ghost. We never wanted for anything but he left us alone. I wasn't super crazy about the monkey bread but my honey ate it like we hadn't had a ridiculously large meal 15 minutes before. I'd kinda like to shave off like a 1/4 of a star because the staff was ultra trendy/Indie as were a majority of the patrons. They looked like H&M and Urban Outfitters threw up all over them but if that's the gimmick I'm ok with it since the food was so amazing.

The concept is cool. The decor is very well put together. And that's about the only         thing I can say positive about the place.  Apparently,  Monday through Friday is by appointment only and Saturday and Sunday, regardless of business hours posted, is by reservation only. I feel like that should be in bold letters all over the website. They were kind enough to squeeze us in but then we had to listen to the waitress give excuses as to why service was so slow and that she was tired. We tried 6 wines, each one more terrible than the last. If you have any sort of palate for wine I'd skip this place. We had a Living Social deal so we got what we paid for but I wouldn't return nor go back and pay full price.

The food was amazing and the portions were a nice size. I had the veal porterhouse and my boyfriend had the bone in pork chop. If you sit outside you can look out over the horizon and see the desert fade into the city lights. If you hit it just right you can watch a beautiful sunset as you eat. The restaurant was romantic and interestingly decorated. Once it gets dark you also have an opportunity to see a swarm of bats flying over head, which was cool and frightening at the same time.   The only complaint was our server. When we arrived my bf had a bit of an upset stomach and we asked the server for a glass of ginger ale, he made a disgusted face but went to retrieve it. He never told us about any of the specials on the menu and we rarely saw him throughout the meal. He did say he would be assisted by someone and she was lovely. Our server's fingers were chewed to bloody messes and we were the ones making disgusted faces when he pointed to something on the menu.

I rarely go to a place more than once.  Now having made that statement, I have been to Po Po's 3 times in the last 3 months! I freakin' love this place! Happy Hour margarita's are only $3.00, yummy, tart,  and strong! My limit is 3 and I'm seriously schnockered. The food is what you'd expect from a place such as this, basic Tex Mex dishes covered in cheese (not necessarily a bad thing), the portions are large and the food comes out hot. The salsa is some of the best I have ever had and I eat the entire bowl every time. I had one of the salads the last time we went and I swear there was half a creamy delicious avocado on it. What a treat!

This is a pretty cool little place. I went for the happy hour and when I arrived the restaurant was empty but there were servers everywhere! I couldn't figure out why but by the time I left the joint was jumpin'! I'm not sure what they are doing to market themselves but it is working.  The martinis were intriguing combinations of fruit and herbs. I had a blackberry & tarragon and my friend had a blueberry & mint. I enjoyed mine and at the HH half off a $5 price tag made it that much better. I will definitely go back and try the burgers. On a side note, if you have the Living Social deal it cannot be used during happy hour.

I've been here twice, the first time by chance and second time by choice. The first occasion, my friends and I were in the area and I searched "live music" on my phone map. This place popped up so we decided to give it a try. Having lived in Boston and New Haven, CT this place totally hit home. The outside is made to look like an an old street in Ireland complete with thatched roofs and water wheel. The inside is sort of a mish mash but in a good way. If you blacked out the windows you would swear you were at least on the East Coast in a legit Irish Pub. We had the fish & chips with a side of curry, corned beef and cabbage, braised short ribs and the seafood stew... all delicious. Our favorite part was our waiter Tony. He was so much fun that the next time we went we requested him as our server. Once again we were not disappointed. Seriously looking forward to St Pat's day this year since this place is great AND on our part of town!

I agree with Paul V. This place is nothing to get excited about. The patties are so thin you can barely taste the meat. I had the Arizona burger because it sounded scrumptious. I was sorely disappointed. Even if the hamburger patty would have been thicker there were so many jalapenos and other toppings on it I felt like I was eating a jalapeno and guacamole sandwich. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy food but my mouth was on fire and I ended up pulling off 4 slices of jalapenos to be able to even finish it. I also ordered the veggie frites because I thought they were battered and fried. I was wrong. It is simply green beans, carrots, and asparagus dropped in hot grease and covered in seasoning. If you are going to make a vegetable unhealthy, follow through on the commitment, don't just do it half heartedly. I did enjoy the fries but the BF didn't think they tasted strong enough like rosemary and garlic. The guy taking our order was very polite and friendly and did let us know that it would be about 20 minutes until we got our food. It was a bit longer than that which I kinda understand but don't. The place was packed but it is just quick cook hamburgers and fries.  For what we got and the quality of the food the price was totally high. For 2 burgers, 2 sides and 2 drinks it was $21 plus they serve you your food so a tip is involved which brought us up to $25! Again I have to agree with Paul V and say I'd rather save my money and go to Mickey D's.

I have to admit we were a bit leery about making an appointment here after reading the reviews but my husband and I both had a good experience. The office is very nice and the equipment is state of the art. The office is open on Saturday and that is an added bonus. I didn't think the doctor was rude or condescending. He was very personable as well as knowledgeable. All of the staff was also very nice and helpful. They also have a good selection of glasses. Both times we had the last appointment so we kept the staff there after closing and go home time but they never seemed irritated or put out. I'm glad we gave them a chance!

I'm adding an extra star for the follow up comment from the owner. Please understand that the quality of care I received from the doctors was more than satisfactory.  And I would like to reiterate that the staff is warm and friendly. And yes, they did go over the expenses with me prior to the visit and called to ask how I would like to proceed when my cat needed more work than expected, however, I still feel that the cost was a bit excessive. Let's face it, to many of us, our pets are a part of the family and to not be able to afford them care that they need can be upsetting. They do offer a payment plan so that is a possible option as well. My review is 3 fold. The doctor's care and follow up is excellent, the grooming meh not so much, and the pricing could maybe be reevaluated. Hopefully, as their business and clientele grow some of the kinks will work themselves out. I wish Norterra Animal Hospital nothing but good luck!

I almost feel bad writing this review. I sincerely wish our experience would have been more impressive. My husband is the sandwich's biggest fan. Although he's is enamored with Jimmy John's we would rather support local independently owned business. We found this place via Yelp and it looked great especially since a few of the reviews were written by East Coasters. My husband grew up in CT and I lived all over the East Coast for about 5 years prior to moving to PHX. Nothing beats an EC Sub. We found these sandwiched to be very bland and dry. I order their version of an Italian and I wanted "hots" which if you're from the EC you know what those are. They didn't have them nor know what I was talking about. My husband wanted a chicken cutlet, also apparently an EC anomaly, and they accommodated him by leaving the sauce off of a Chicken Parm but it wasn't quite the same.The place is very clean. The prices are good and the staff, who I assume were the owners were very nice. The place is definitely better than subway *barf* but sadly it didn't rock my world.

What a terrible place! The vibe at the Park West location is nothing like the one in Litchfield Park. It is a cheap, unbranded knock off, wanna-be Hooters. We went early, around 7:30 on the Saturday before Halloween. All of the waitresses were dressed in "costume." There was Provocative Prostitute, Provocative Cat, and Provocative I'm not sure but I think also Prostitute. I'm no prude by any means but there should still be a reasonable level of professionalism in a bar/restaurant located in the 'burbs early in the evening. The service was extremely slow and our waitress was inattentive. I will say she was very nice but clearly not hired not for her service experience. There was also a table in the back of shrieking children who apparently belonged to one of the  gentlemen working behind the bar (possibly manager?) either that or the Provocative Geisha was letting a stranger discipline her children. The music was so loud my husband and I had to scream louder than those shrieking kids to communicate with each other. Eventually we just stopped trying to talk and played with our phones. Not exactly how I wanted to spend the evening with my Honey. I am giving it 2 stars because the food was really good. My hubby likes his wings super crispy and he got just that and man were they tasty! I had one of the tarts and, it too, was delicious. The second star is for the music. Although ridiculously loud, the live music duo playing in the corner was talented and we enjoyed listening to them. I was also pretty shocked and dismayed by their draft beer selection. It was pretty basic for a placed called Taps. I would have assumed an extensive craft beer menu but the reality was that it had a couple of San Tan varieties and several other beers that you can find just about anywhere. A couple other things to notate were that there were no salt and pepper shakers on the table, we didn't get silverware or napkins until after our food was brought to the table, and there was clearly no seating chart or defined sections for the servers because they were squabbling over who was going to take our table. The whole experience made me feel like I was on a taping of Restaurant Undercover.

This is a tiny little place that you'd never think to go in to. She was selling her wares at farmers markets and recently opened this location. We ordered pierogies to have for Christmas Day and decided to have lunch there when we went to go pick them up. We had the pork spare ribs with potato, peas and carrots. Yum! It was just like if we had gone to my mother in law's house to eat. There was nothing restauranty about it, just homey comfort food and plenty of it. I'm looking forward to eating the pierogies we brought home, I just hope I can make it until Christmas! If you can't make it to the restaurant you can go to the website and there is a list of farmers markets and times where you can find her food as well.

I had an appointment today and I have to say I especially enjoyed my time there. I know thats a really weird thing to say since I had a waxing service but Brooke was great! I felt very comfortable with her just as if I'd known her for along time. I highly recommend her and this salon.

I feel like the West Side gets the short end when it comes to new business. We were super excited to see a new breakfast place open up not too far from home on our side of town. The renovation converting it from the Good Egg  made it very bright, open and inviting. The portions are HUGE and I highly recommend the protein pancake although I'm still unclear why it is a "protein" pancake. I asked the waitress and she said, and this is a direct quote, "It has blueberries, granola, and almonds in it, I guess it is the almond that give it all the protein." Well thanks, I read the menu, I understood the ingredients, but you still didn't answer my questions. Whatever, it was delicious and we'd go back and get it again. I chalk her poor product knowledge (we asked her a few other questions she couldn't answer) up to the place being new and left it at that.

I have amended my review and added a star, I believe in being fair and honest in every situation. The manager did contact me the very night after reading my review. Although not my intention with the poor review, my money was refunded. The extra star is not for the refund but for the extremely fast response from the manager. So I retract my statement about them no caring they do. I wish them luck in the future and hopefully they can get the kinks worked out.   We're always excited to see new, independently owned places on the West Side but once again we were disappointed. After seeing such rave reviews we were happy to find this place. After eating here I'm suspicious that the reviewers who gave this place 5 stars may have some affiliation with the owners or staff. When we walked in, there were a few occupied tables and everyone working there greeted us and one guy suggested we sit on the patio. We did and it was nice out there but then it took quite a long time for anyone to come out. When someone finally did he said he was going to get our drink order and then get us some menus. Weird order of events in my opinion. We had to wait until we got our drinks to even start deciding what we wanted to eat? The Hub's ordered an iced tea and I ordered a margarita with no salt. Our drinks and menus came out, mine with salt and when the Hub's asked for sweet n low the waitress said they didn't have any but offered sugar. Huh?! Ok, a little bizarre that they didn't have some sort of artificial sweetener but no big deal... until she returned with sugar on a paper plate. They apparently have iced tea but no sweeteners to offer with it. My margarita tasted like store bought mix and came out in a beer pint glass. Our food came out fast and it was ok until my husband got to the end of his French fries and there were curly black hairs in them. I have long blonde hair and my husband has auburn so they for sure weren't ours. I had to go in and give my credit card to the bartender to pay and when the waitress came back out with my receipt I showed her the hairs. She did offer to take the dish off of our ticket but I refused. He had eaten almost the whole thing so I didn't think that was fair. I heard her go in and summon the manager to show her the hairs but no one came back out to apologize so obviously they didn't care. I guess we'll continue to go to Phoenix or Scottsdale to get a decent meal. That's a shame.

Moving is never fun and is always stressful. I am so glad i found Dose moving. Marilee was very responsive while communicating via Yelp and  incredibly sweet and accommodating on the phone. The start time available on my date was 1:00. I thought for sure they'd be late and it would take forever. I couldn't have been more wrong.  I got a call from the crew asking if they could come early. What a relief! Brandon and his crew were amazing. When they arrived, they seriously hustled, and by hustled I mean they were running back into the house for the next load. It was unbelievable how fast they finished. I never herd them complain and they didn't take any breaks. They guys were very polite, weren't annoyed by my little dog following them around and even offered to help me load my car. The unloading was even faster than the load and they put the furniture and boxes in the appropriate rooms, they didn't just dump it. Through the whole experience I was never flustered or stressed out, it all went so smoothly.  I'm in temporary housing until the close of my new home and I will absolutely be using them again when we move.

We used them again because of how wonderful they were the first time. They did not disappoint. Arrived early, worked exceptionally fast, and everything was in good shape after unloading.

I'm from New Orleans and I've been to my fair share of crawfish boils but I have never tasted anything like this! My lips are still a little tingly as I write this and that isn't a bad thing.  I had crawfish and shrimp. The shrimp were huge! I got them both "hot and juicy" style and medium heat. I ordered Hot but the server was like "are you sure? You've never been here before." On her recommendation I got the Medium and I am glad I did. I probably could have handled the hot but I wouldn't have enjoyed it. If it wouldn't have been totally inappropriate I would have slurped the juice off the table!  My hubs got the fried shrimp, also HUGE and battered in fish fry which was nice. He isn't much of a seafood eater but he even said he would like to go back. The beer selection isn't bad and the service was overly attentive if anything. Definitely quality. If you are delicate and don't want to get your hands dirty this isn't the place (they give you gloves but don't be that guy/girl) but I do recommend the bib.
