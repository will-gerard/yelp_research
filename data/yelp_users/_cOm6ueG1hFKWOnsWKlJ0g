Me and my family have been coming here for years, I also just converted my boyfriend to Dr. Saydyk. They are always really flexible with my schedule. I moved farther away but the trust in a good dentist is worth it.  Me and my family will continue here for years to come!

I just recently moved to Arizona a month ago. My boyfriend bought me a groupon for 4d nail salon. Me not knowing my way around Arizona yet googld 4D nail salon and it Led me to this spa location on Greenfield and Warner. I went inside and a gentlemen greeted me I presented him with my groupon and told him i was looking for 4D nail salon. I asked him if this was 4D salon, he said yes. So he proceeded to start my set of nails then i got a pedicure and then when i went to pay, I again presented him with my groupon, he then told me that this wasn't 4D nails and they couldnt except my groupon. My total was $63.00. My groupon was a total $51.00 in value. I waited for the manager and told him my experience, he then told me maybe i should know my directions better.  He then told me there was nothing he could do. When the gentlemen who did my nails was asked about the incident, he then lied about seeing the groupon and said he thought it was a price match coupon, which was a lie because that was never brought up. So basically they tricked me into getting my nails done at their location. I am not a penny pincher i just do not like to be tricked into things. If i had a groupon for a different salon why would i come to this location??? Apparently this didn't make sense to the manager. I would have to say this is the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD!
