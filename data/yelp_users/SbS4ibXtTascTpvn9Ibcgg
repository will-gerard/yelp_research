Only reason not 5 stars is because they do not deliver. Food is great. Amazing customer service and feel is family owned!

Great place to take the kids when it's hot outside. Food is a bit expensive for the quality. Love being able to play with the kids and roam around through the tunnels. Bathrooms could be cleaner but they have tons of use! Love that they expanded!

Amazing buffalo chicken pizza! Restaurant could be a lot cleaner though! Sometimes salad bar isn't stocked fully but it's a great lunch special!

Amazing lunch spot. Great pizza that is wood fired and prepped the way you like it. Highly recommend the buffalo chicken!

Friendly new ownership. Little disappointed it took close to 2.5 hours for a new set and a pedicure and I was the only person in. Price was a little high for my liking. 80 with tip for a full set and pedicure. Did a standard French tip acrylic set and French tip pedicure. My full set was uneven and grew out pretty gross. Sad as it was my go to close to the house. Have found a new place!
