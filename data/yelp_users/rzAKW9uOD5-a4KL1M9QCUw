AMAZING. My roommate tipped me off about this honest, affordable auto shop. I brought my car in for an oil leak and cannot thank the amazing staff enough. They were so helpful and completely honest about how easy and cheap the fix was, as well as what was really necessary to repair. I will never go anywhere else!!

The food is very good, the margaritas hit the spot, and the service is great.  The atmosphere is a little cheesy but overall it's a great place to go!!

I went with a group of friends on a Friday night; we had an absolute blast! It didn't hurt that my favorite beer is on tap: Papago Orange Blossom :) we played Jenga and Uno while we devoured appetizers. It's pretty loud inside, but didn't bother us at all. The service was great. We will be back!

INCREDIBLE FOOD.  The service is amazing, the fresh-squeezed margarita is my favorite, and the atmosphere is cozy.  Sierra Bonita accommodated a huge group of us and everything was perfect.  It's a wonderful spot, you won't regret going.

Amazingly slow drive thru. It's so slow that I've had time to check my personal email, work email, and write this review. It's painful. I've never been to a Starbucks that is this slow - it's too bad because it's on my way to work! I will not be coming back.

I come here every single morning. They are SO fast. And consistently fast. Every single order has been correct. The employees at the window are always friendly and efficient. I can't say anything negative about this location! If you are debating between the one on FLW and the 101, or this one, choose this one! Waaaaay better :)

Terrible sushi and the drinks have no alcohol in them.  It's cheap, and somehow you still manage to get less than what you paid for.

The service we received was incredible. The yellowtail carpaccio was one of the best appetizers I've ever had. We loved the sake as well! I will definitely be returning soon. It was an amazing experience!

They are always so fast and efficient - I love bringing my car here. They don't try to up-sell you and are honest about what your car needs to have done. The prices are fair too. I would recommend Lightning Lube to anyone!

I cannot say enough good things about R&S Mattress. I had a mattress in WA that I was completely obsessed with, so my mom called all around upon my return to Scottsdale in an effort to find it again for me. It was at R&S, and my mom told them how much we had spent in WA. They agreed to match the price. I went in right away to pay for it, and they already had it pulled out and ready for me. I told them I lived right down the road, and they said that the delivery fee would be just $10, and they could do it same day. David came and personally delivered it himself after closing the store, because he knew how desperate I was to get off of my air mattress. He also told me to come back by so he could reimburse me the $10 delivery fee. Of course, I'm not doing that. I have never slept better, and the experience of buying the mattress was above and beyond what would ever be expected. Thank you R&S and thank you David!!

We go to Majerles all the time and I have never been disappointed.  The food is good, the drinks are strong, and the service has always been great.  It's a fun place to watch football.  I will always be a huge fan of Majerles!

I am SO thankful for Scottsdale Doggie Suites! I travel frequently and feel so much better knowing that my baby girl is being cared for. Now she runs to the staff when I drop her off! I can tell she is very comfortable with them, and it's nice receiving pictures of her each day I am gone as well. She comes home exhausted from playing all day and I know she is loved on by the staff. I couldn't ask for better care for my girl while I'm away. Thank you for all that you do for Ellie!

This place is an absolute joke. The management is non existent (obviously, or they'd be concerned about what a crappy place it is). I lost my wallet and called 8 times in the span of a week. No one answered but the voicemail promised to call back if I left a message. The drinks are super over priced. And don't get me started on the staff at the door. So rude and condescending. It's like they think they run the nicest club in Vegas or something. Hi-Fi: you're a joke.

The food and drinks were actually really good!  The service was sub-par.  The "manager" was clearly intoxicated and flirted with our table of girls.  It took almost 45 minutes to pay for our bill...not sure why!

Laurie Peterson has been a godsend. She is so knowledgeable and so helpful and always accessible. I don't know what I would do here in Arizona without her, as I moved down from Seattle and left my specialist up there. She truly cares about her patients and has the best bedside manner I've ever experienced. I could go on and on about Laurie - she's incredible. Even if she is unavailable, her medical assistant is very prompt at getting back to me. I would highly recommend this office and Laurie Peterson.

Perfect gel mani and standard pedi!! The staff is so friendly and helpful. They squeezed me right in and catered to me the entire time. They were so sweet and my nails are perfect!! I will definitely be back :) I'm so happy I discovered this little gem!
