Let me start with 4 children.... We always heard Ipic two fold had better service and accommodations that AMC. Due to proximity we attend AMC..beware  Every Friday, when disney comes out with a new flix, we go!! FAMILY TRADITION!! So that's what??? Over $200 a trip?? Ya!! They love it!  So this past experience completely shocked me when Imy friends and I attended AMC to see "dumb and dumber too". It was Dumb and dumber too".    ... Dumb and Dumber....  We were having a good time! Management completely "mis-handled" our situation of having a good time and become very passive aggressive by cutting is off   Sorry, but we seem to be struggling with where to spend our money...

Hurry up and Leave!  This was our third visit to Hana because the food is excellent. God forbid you walk in at 8:40pm, 20 minutes until posted hours of closing time. Might as well post closing at 8:30pm as both service and quality decline closer to closing!!!  Fist two visits went extremely well and so why not try it a third, right?!?! NO! It was CLEAR by the hostesses reaction that we were not welcome at 840pm as she rolled her eyes and quickly walked away from us. Not a good first impression but we were confident in the food and decided to give it a go. We had a nice bottle of wine and were expecting a wonderful date night and the typical HANA experience... DENIED! We were in and out in less than 40 minutes, $75 for two of us (without tip), not including our bottle of wine we shared one glass of. We found ourselves shoveling food in our faces as the servers were doing all of their side work surrounding us. Very uncomfortable dining experience and disappointing.   I'm not one to post and especially not with a negative review and I WILL go back (before 8pm), but I do believe the owners and future guest should be aware of this situation. Last time I checked if your posted hours are until 9pm, you serve food until 9pm???? Right? Not everyone out by 9pm! Not to mention with your price point, guest are visiting your establishment to enjoy their dinning experience and not be rushed!   We ended up going to Sochu House for a couple other dishes as we did not get enough to eat and Lord knows my man needs his dessert. Hopefully, next visit will be earlier and better. Know that you have been warned, and enjoy Hana, but go early!!!!!

I am slightly frustrated! As my original appt was scheduled at 10am... later finding out she over booked and wanted to me to come at 9am for nails and hair at 10am. I am a bartender at a local bar and had closed the night before (going to sleep at 3:30am) needless to say I was exhausted!  After having trouble find the place and had to circle around Central (super pain in the butt!) showing up at 9:15am I was greeted and told my appts were canceled. Wow! late 15 mins and my appt were just canceled?!!?  Now, Not claiming it was entirely their fault.... as I could have looked up the number and called saying I was running a little late, but as a business they could have called me to see if I was on my way?  Nail appt at 9... ok cancel that, my bad! But hair appt at 10 and you still cancel that? I was still 45 mins early for a 10am appt!!!!  NEVER have I EVER had a salon tell me my appt is canceled when I was at the salon still with enough time..... Whats worse is that it was my birthday weekend and I was really looking forward to trying out a new salon, as well as being a bartender in the area, I would have loved to send business their way! Guess not :(

I've heard so many good things about this place I decided to check it out! I had a fun night out planned and scheduled an appt 1.5hrs before I was meeting up with my friends. What an amazing idea!!!! Never will I ever do my own hair again! Walked in with my makeup and outfit on and walked out with great hair! This place is seriously icing on the cake to complete your look! My stylist nailed the style I was looking for, everyone was super friendly as well. Side note.... I was really looking forward to an adult beverage while getting styled but was never offered anything?? Maybe I misunderstood other reviews on that?? Would have been a nice touch on my overall experience! I will definitely be back!!!
