Rarely do I give out five stars for hotels, but there you have it. A resort perfect in every way. My husband and I booked our stay for one night last Tuesday on the day of through the Hotel Tonight app. $100 for the room... truly a steal. There was an extra $30 resort fee tacked on that all guests must pay, and which pays gratuity for the valets and housekeepers, gives you access to the pool and fitness center, etc. The pool, by the way, is open 24 hours, which was so cool because we are such night owls and we totally had the pool all to ourselves at 1 in the morning. The pool also has floating rafts you can use for free, plus clean towels, comfy lounge chairs, cabanas, and bar service. The pool did not disappoint.  The customer service was phenomenal. The woman who checked us in was very chipper and seemed genuinely happy to have us there, and one of the valets gave us the tour of the resort and showed us to our room. He was very helpful and kind.  The room was decorated lovely, and although we had hoped for a king bed, we made do with the double beds we ended up with (apparently they were too booked to hook us up with a king bed). There is a large bathtub in the bathroom, but the wall next to it can be opened up completely, so it was like taking a bath in the bedroom. Really pretty and neat. Plus, they had candles set up, so you better believe your heiny I took advantage of those.  My only qualm is that housekeeping came knocking at our door at 11 (check out wasn't until noon), successfully waking us up as we had gone to sleep really late the night before. My husband had to run to the door before they came in, as we were both *ahem* in the nude. He ended up stubbing his toe so hard in the process that his big toenail ripped off completely and therefore effectively ending our little staycation.   Alas, missing toenail and all, an excellent experience in every way!

My husband had almost everything he needed for our wedding. He had the tie, the shirt, the pants, the belt, and the shoes. We simply needed a vest and told the guy helping us that right up front. He was friendly, which is the only reason this place gets two stars and not one, but he is also the reason this place is getting two stars in the first place. He was pushy and made us feel like my husband's already chosen pieces of attire were not good enough. "Those pants are too long, that shirt won't match anything, I think a different tie will look better, etc etc." We were very firm in telling him that we have made up our mind and all we needed was a vest, but he proceeded to sell us the following anyway: A shirt, pants, shoes, belt, jacket, tie, socks, and various other items we had no interest in purchasing. We felt so pressured and like he wasn't listening to our needs. We will never come back here, lest we want to spend the day being pressured to buy the entire store.

This really is my favorite way to get my cardio on. I really enjoy coming here, despite the high prices. The people working here seem to enjoy it, which adds to the element of excitement. I've been here twice. I ranked first place the first time, and sixth the second. It is easy to operate the equipment and as long as you stay motivated and on top of your game, it's not difficult to do well. I think this would be an excellent place to hold a private party for any age group. You should laser tag out at least once (more specifically, Laser Quest). If you don't like it, fine. But if you're the competitor type, this is your place for sure!

This place is great for out of the ordinary food items, and they have a good selection of wine. They also have some of the most beautiful flowers (take note, boys). However, I usually come for the dessert. They have a little bakery section with absolutely amazing desserts. I just wish this place wasn't so pricey, but, sometimes it is worth the splurge for the high end food and classy atmosphere. So much better than sterile aisles packed with cans and boxes and being checked out by lackluster cashiers. If I were rich, this would be my grocery store of choice, no doubt.

This is the type of restaurant/coffee bar you take somebody whom you want to impress. Liberty Market is modern, stylish, and has excellent food and service to back up the impressive atmosphere. I have in the past driven 30 minutes from my house just to have an iced carmel latte made by these guys. It's just that good. The menu is also inventive and I would highly recommend getting the appetizer pizza to start with hummus on the side. All of the meals are great, and therefore I can't recommend anything above the rest. It's all so good! Be sure to check out the restrooms before you leave, too. Go inside every stall (they are co ed) and be amazed! Four solid stars from this girl!

Elegant. Sophisticated. Drool-all-over-everythingly gorgeous. The Linen Tree is filled with the highest quality products, and the customer service is always impeccable. I literally wanted to cuddle into all the sheets and duvets and comforters and never leave the first time I visited. And perhaps every subsequent visit after that. And by perhaps, I mean definitely.  Visually put, The Linen Tree is like a glamorous version of Pottery Barn. Yes, they have linens as the name suggests, but they also have dining sets, furniture, bathroom products, perfume, home decor, candles, and just about everything else needed to make your house a home fit for royalty. The owners personally travel all over the world and reach out to artisans on a local, national, and even global scale to offer their customers unique handcrafted products worth envying.  Yes, The Linen Tree is sophisticated and ritzy, but they also offer plenty of products under $20 that are perfect for gifts or simply pampering yourself with. Do not feel intimidated by my description here. It's not my fault I'm in love. At any rate, the owners and employees are wonderful, attentive people who love what they do and want you to feel at home, whether you're picking up a full bedding set or a candle for your mother.  So seriously stop in when you get a chance! It is located in an unassuming strip in North Scottsdale, but you will be transported into a new, breathtaking dimension when you step inside.

Without diving in to my personal life story, I would like to briefly mention that I got married last year with literally not an ounce of cooking knowledge. In the past few months, my husband and I have really buckled down and have avidly avoided eating out or getting take out. So we decided to cook. And cook we do! We come to this Safeway every week like clockwork to stock up on food for the rest of the week. I have found that they have nearly everything we need, save a couple ingredients we may need to grab at the Whole Foods down the street. It has become such a blessing to be so close to a store like this one. It is clean, fully stocked, organized, and the customer base is typically young, laid back, and non-threatening to a small girl like me. This is the first time in my whole life that I confidently feel at home in a grocery store. I can navigate those aisles like nobody's business, and they are always in tip top shape.  I would love to give this location five stars, but I have found too often that the produce (particularly fruit) is either moldy, too ripe, or overall not very good when I bring it home. I also think that some of the customer service could use a little boost in morale, although in many cases the customer service is pretty doggone good for a grocery store. Another word of warning: this location can get VERY busy. I don't mind it, though, because I quite like the bustling atmosphere.  This Safeway has seen my husband and me through a great transition in our lives, and because of it, I actually look forward to our weekly shopping trips.

My husband and I were very disappointed after our most recent trip to this location. My husband received a coupon via email for $14 off an oil change. He called yesterday and asked if he had to print it out or of he could just bring in his phone. They told him he could show it on his phone, and then my husband informed them he'd be in the next day to redeem it. They said okay. So fast forward to today (1/24). My husband shows the guy the coupon when he went to pay, and the guy said he wouldn't accept it because they were already running a $10 off deal. Obviously we knew we weren't going to get $14 off the already discounted price, so we just asked him to price it at regular price then give us the $14 off since our coupon was worth more. He didn't budge. We had another coupon for 15% of the other services they did but they still wouldn't take it. So I'm angry for two reasons: 1) our coupons were completely invalid when they shouldn't have been and 2) nobody told my husband that he couldn't use it when he called about it yesterday. Although it was only 4 dollars, it's really the principle. We didn't even get an apology for this inconvenience. Pretty poor customer service on their behalf. These guys have officially lost two regular customers over this. I hope the 4 bucks was worth it, Jiffy Lube!

Been to this location twice, but only because my boss asked me to take her car here specifically to get a basic wash inside and out. The employees are nice enough, and the only reason I'm not giving this place 1 star. I can vaguely remember bringing the car in about a year ago and being quite disappointed with the interior specifically, which is what happened this time around. I am not kidding when I say it looked like they didn't vacuum inside AT ALL, which is part of the Deluxe car wash. In addition, this last time I went, when they finished cleaning the car, they drove the car to a really weird area in the middle of the gas station parking lot and didn't even tell us it was done (we were the only ones sitting outside). It was so awkward having to go up to them in the middle of cleaning other cars to ask for the keys. For $18, I felt like I wasted my boss's money. The outside looked better, but not better enough to account for $18. She keeps asking me to bring the car here, but I don't get it. I would much rather take it to a five dollar car wash and vacuum it myself, it would look so much better!

A month ago, I associated humane societies with the dirty, loud, and depressing pounds I had visited when I was a child. The Arizona Humane Society has completely turned this perspective upside down. A couple weeks ago, my husband and I drove quite the distance to check out the cats they had for adoption (I had already been to several pet stores). I was immediately impressed with how clean and beautiful this establishment was. It is easy to navigate and the staff is unbelievably helpful and friendly. We asked to see a few cats, and when we saw "the one" we totally fell in love. Her name was Smokey, but we have since renamed her Sherlock. She has extra toes. And she is a firecracker! The staff stayed past closing hours to help us fill out paperwork so we could take her home that day, which shows me how much they care that these precious animals get adopted. When it is time for us to get a dog, this will be the first place we go. The process couldn't have been smoother, and the staff gave us excellent pointers on how to introduce her to our new house. We will be back!

I have been to Roaring Fork a handful of times. Only one unpleasant experience regarding a grossly overcooked "medium rare" filet, which they corrected quickly. I would recommend the green chile stew, even though I don't really enjoy spicy things. Seems like everyone and their mother come here for that stew. My favorite meal so far has been the Dr. Pepper ribs... fall off the bone delicious. As far as drinks go, their guava mojito is to die for! Get it! Service here is always excellent and I always look forward to my visits here.

I may make a few enemies in writing this review, and I may even get kicked out of Tempe completely, but seriously, Four Peaks is not the love of my life. Granted, I don't care for beer, so this is more or less a review of the food, atmosphere, and non-beer-like drinks. I have been here a few times with the husband (he loves it here) and I just don't get the hype. The food is bar food. Straight up bar food. I like the outdoor seating much better than indoor. Inside the place feels a little dreary, much like many bars I have encountered. The servers are friendly enough, although sometimes the service is a little slow. I get something different to eat every time, which if you know me, is not a good thing. When I like something, I get it every visit, but here, I am just searching for something - anything - that I like enough to order next time. Sigh. I know I'll be back, and I can't say I dread coming here - I usually have fun. I just feel like there are many places I'd rather spend my money on.

This restaurant is the one that my husband and I disagree with the rating the most. He swears by this place. The atmosphere, the food, the service. He thinks it's all great. However, after being drug here a half a dozen times or so, I hate to say that I find nothing special about Harlow's. It is always very busy, but not in a busting, upbeat way. More like people running around frazzled and disjointed. The service is average. The waitstaff does their job, but they aren't overly friendly. The food is average to less than average quality. I always order breakfast items, so I can't comment on their lunch menu. However, in my experience at Harlow's, french toast is french toast. A muffin is a muffin. And that's it, really. The atmosphere is kind of dismal to me as well, but I have yet to put my finger on as to why it feels this way.  I want to love this place, I really do, but Harlow's has yet to prove anything special to me. Perhaps I'll be back, but if I'm honest it would take quite a big change for me to catch onto the hype.

I just need somebody, anybody, to come pick me up from my pizza-less home right now and take me to get a slice (or two!) at Slices. The slices of pizza here are huge, and at a good price. They have a large selection, but I usually keep it simple with a cheese slice, and it always hits the spot. Don't expect some glamorous restaurant. It's very small and a little dingy with a TV on usually playing some kind of sports. It is a quick, cheap, and easy option for those of us who just can't get their acts together. Long live Slices!

I live down the street from Casey Moore's. I have been here a total of three times. The first time a group of us just ordered drinks, and the margaritas my friend and I ordered were so terrible that we sent them back. The second time I went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich. Again, it was so awful I had to send it back. I am not a picky eater, nor have I been known to complain about food or service when dining out. There has only been one other restaurant I have ever been to where I sent food back. So, this place was already two for two. Alas, my husband begged me to go back once more. He was craving oysters and since this is an oyster house, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give them one more shot. It was last Thursday evening, and the place was hoppin'. This time, the food was decent. Not good, but decent enough where I may have given Casey Moore's a fourth chance had I been impressed with the service. But the service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress got us our drinks and didn't come back to take our orders for another 20 minutes. We sat there awkwardly waiting for her to stop by, and though she passed us quickly several times, she never even acknowledged us with a simple "I'll be back with your orders." When she did arrive 20 minutes later, she asked if we were ready to order without even an apology. I am not kidding you when I say she acted like she wanted nothing to do with us. She was very monotone and never smiled with us. I would like to pass this off as her having a bad night, but when she went to her other tables (all full of men with drinks) she suddenly lit up, laughed, and had a blast with them. It was so awkward to the point that my husband asked if maybe we knew her and had upset her in some way in the past. But no. This was our first time meeting her. We were pleasant customers who didn't complain about the mediocre food or slow service. We were polite and left a good tip. We pride ourselves on being fun, engaging, and polite with our servers since we go out often. But let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry. We live so damn close to this place and would have loved to be regulars... It is such a shame that Casey Moore's has now given us three good reasons to never come back. And I can't find any information on their website of how to contact the manager about this, so I am left to rant here on Yelp, completely unsatisfied. Sigh...

Words cannot even express how much I hate this place. It's literally five minutes from my house in Tempe and everybody and their mother loves it here. I've been here four times. FOUR CHANCES, and they blew every single one.  Visit #1: I go with a handful of girlfriends. Order a margarita. Worst margarita of my life, hands down. My friend also ordered one and hated it. We both had to send it back (the first and only time I have ever sent a drink back. It was that bad). We told our server that we'd like something different, but we needed a moment to decide. She rolled her eyes, took them away, and we didn't see her until much later, when she delivered our bill. I had no drinks that night.  Visit #2: I went with my husband for lunch. Ordered the crab sandwich. I took a bite and it was an effort to swallow it, it was so disgusting. Now, I used to live off of eating out just about every day of the week. My husband and I are always incredibly polite to our servers and feign enjoying meals that are sub par. Getting meals you don't like is a part of life. This, however, was inedible. For the second time ever (I never send food back, I know how annoying it is for the servers and feel so bad), I had to send it back and ask for something different. Our server seemed really perturbed, but did bring me the meal I ordered instead. It was mediocre at best, but I ate it without any complaint. I apologized profusely to our server and assured her that I liked the new meal, even though I didn't, in hopes of her mood improving. It didn't.  Visit #3: Don't even ask me why, but my husband and I were craving Oysters and thought that we'd give Casey Moore's Oyster House another chance to impress us. Not only were the oysters not good (we did not complain about them this time, though), but our server was so rude that we thought we had wronged her in some way. Dirty looks, only stopped by twice I believe in the hour and a half we were there, didn't say hello or smile once. We thought maybe we had caught her on a bad day, but the joyful smile on her face as she laughed with the table of men directly across from us quickly made us realize that this was not the case. To be clear, we did not complain about anything at any time. We were kind, polite, and didn't keep her from other tables. What the hell?  Visit #4 (tonight): I went with a girlfriend for drinks after a run. I only went because it was a beautiful night and I wanted to sit outdoors. First off, we had my friend's dog with us and went to the front without the dog to see if we could tie him up outside of the establishment (around a tree). Nobody was there so we went back to get the dog to tie him up (again, outside of the place, by the sidewalk). A man promptly and rudely said, "I'm not letting you two in with that dog out there." Okay. So we took the dog back to the car and left the window down for him. When we got back and found a seat, I smiled and said hello to our server when he greeted us. Upon asking us what we wanted to drink, I said, "There is a drink at Boulder's (bar down the street) I really like and was wondering if you guys might do something similar..." "We don't." He said, and just looked at us. That's it. I proceeded to tell him what the drink was (Strongbow mixed with a Raspberry type beer). "No, I told you we don't." Finally after awkwardly floundering about, my friend and I settled on another drink. We did get what we ordered and it was good (we both got Strongbows with a shot of Fireball). But seriously, dealing with TWO rude men tonight, plus the history I've had there, makes me realize I really will never go back ever. And I mean it this time.  I mean truly, I am extremely polite and go above and beyond to make people feel comfortable and happy to be serving me. I smile big, say hello, don't take too much of their time, don't whine or complain, etc. But the fact that four of my all time worst restaurant experiences were all from Casey Moore's is just too much to ignore. I hate that place and hate that I'm the only one who feels this way.

About a month ago, I convinced my husband to do the unthinkable - adopt a cat! This was a feat that was not easy, since he doesn't like them. So we go to this Petco. I will tell you that I have given this place two stars ONLY because the guy helping us was super friendly. We held all of the 5 cats they had and fell in love with a darling kitty. For various reasons, we were unable to bring her home that night, so we asked if we could put her on hold. The guy said no, but took our names/number down to alert us if anybody was interested. He told us she had been there the longest, so we should be in the clear to pick her up tomorrow. So I spend all night thinking about her, what I'll name her, and how my life will be infinitely better with her. So, the next morning, I get up and get ready to go adopt this absolutely darling cat that, in my heart and head, was mine. So I call to let them know I'm coming in to get her and - get this - SHE HAS BEEN ADOPTED. Oh, and get this - they used my husband and I wanting to adopt her as leverage to get this other family to adopt her. In their words, "We told this family that you guys wanted to adopt her today, so we said that if they wanted to do it, they need to do it now." They straight up played us! (Although I don't think it was the guy's fault who helped us initially.)  I cried. That cat was mine! What happened? Oh yeah, these jerks used me to sell her to someone else.  On the bright side, we have adopted and completely fallen in love with a cat from PETSMART. She is sitting with me now writing this review and I love her. And also, my husband loves her. So suck it, Petco!

For 22 years, I have tried to hide my naturally (very!) curly hair. I would spend hours straightening it daily... hours! I desperately wanted to fit in and have the beautiful silky hair you see on every magazine cover. About two months ago, I just threw up my hands and said, "Screw it!" Two months later, I am now a very proud curly girl, and I have felt so much freedom from allowing myself to finally be me.  My mother is a hair stylist and has been doing my hair for many years at no cost to me. She is fabulous at what she does and has worked at some top notch salons. However, she is not as experienced with naturally curly hair as I'd like my stylist to be. I decided to search for a hair stylist with training in how to specially cut hair for a girl like me. I looked at a list of Deva Curl trained stylists, and up popped Terri.   The moment I entered her seat, I felt like a celebrity. She, along with several other stylists, rushed over and oohed and aahhhed at my hair. Mind you, my curly hair has always been something to hide, but here... well, I felt like a star! I am well researched in how to take care of my curls, but even so, Terri had excellent ideas and tips for me (which I have been using!). Her and her assistant treated me so well and I could tell they knew exactly what they were doing. Other stylists in the salon also came over and told me how much they loved my hair... what a great feeling! I walked out feeling confident and more in love with my curls than ever. Not to mention Terri did a superb job! Can't wait to go back in a few weeks!

The two stars are for the times that I found something incredible at an incredible price. This place is pretty dumpy and always very crowded. It is pretty far out of my way, so I am usually disappointed when I come home empty handed. Personally, my favorite finds aren't the clothes, but rather, the home goods type things. My favorite finds: A mighty wallet (look it up - so cool) for $1.97, a stand up cardboard cutout of Jacob from Twilight for $1.97, and a ton of brand new (super cute) picture books for $0.44 each. I have gotten plenty of clothes, but it seems like even if there are no holes when I buy it, most of them are made of poor material and fall apart in the wash. If I lived closer, I'd probably go a lot to increase my odds of finding something, but lately it hasn't been worth the drive for me, plus you have to put up with kids and crazy ladies who want that Coach bag in you cart even if it kills them. Dirty, cluttered, unorganized, and a lot of poor quality clothing. Employees are surprisingly friendly. Go if you're in the area, but don't make a special trip. You will most likely come home disappointed.

The more I come here the more I have fallen in love! Over the years I have found some incredible finds that make the encounters with ridiculously aggressive women worth it. This place isn't for the faint of heart or for the people who just want to therapy shop. It's always so busy and there are women who SWARM the clothes that are freshly put out (we're talking grabbing handfuls of hangers without looking at what they're grabbing). It can be mildly distressing when you are non confrontational but also want a chance at the new stuff. However, I will say that Last Chance has become somewhat of a second home and I can't imagine ever being without it! Yes, it can be gross, and overwhelming, but for me, it's so worth it when you find that purse or pair of jeans for a fraction of the price!

I am having a difficult time deciding how to even begin this review. In the simplest terms, Cibo has my heart. The outdoor seating is romantic and lovely, while indoors is equally cute and "busy." The food is TO DIE FOR. If I was on death row, their food would constitute my last meal. Hands down, they have the best pizza I have ever had the pleasure to taste. Do not miss the opportunity to order the Burrata as an appetizer (and then again for dinner!) - the mozzarella is creamy, the prosciutto fresh, and the bread baked to perfection. We also had the prosciutto crudo pizza, which was every bit as delicious as the appetizer. Overall, one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had. A big 5/5 from this foodie here.

Yeah.... no.  I love roller coasters. I am a roller coaster enthusiast and I think they are rad. The best part about roller coasters, for me, is the power you feel towering over whatever amusement part, or in this case, city, you ride over. Unfortunately, unless you are at the very front of this roller coaster, all you're going to see is a plastic seat in front of you, and you won't be able to crane your neck to the side due to the harness holding you in. At least that's your view when you're 5'3", not sure about my taller counterparts.  Sure, you could wait in line for the front seats. Oh wait, whats that? No you can't. For the hefty price of $14 per ticket, you can't even choose where you sit. Of course people tried as they might to get their money's worth by sitting in the front, but the workers promptly scolded them and made them "fill up" the rest of the roller coaster's rows.  So there you have it. $14 to look at a plastic seat for a good, what, 60 seconds? No thank you. I'd rather see the strip through a taxi cab while drinking my yard of rum, thank you very much.

Ikea has singlehandedly furnished my first home, and I love it! Although it is a lot of work to put together some of the furniture, it is so rewarding when you finish, wipe off all your nasty sweat, and bask in the glory of all that is Ikea. Everything is so modern and cool here. I love spending the day with my husband here, browsing through the little rooms they have put together and lusting after paintings and such that would never match anything in our home. We take a lot of pride in our home and would never accept cheap looking furniture, however, there has been a time or two when the furniture was bent or scratched and we didn't realized it until it was all put together. Overall, I feel like the prices here are awesome for what you get. We recently bought and assembled the Hemnes TV unit, and it may be my very favorite item I have bought here to date. We have more to do to the house, and we will continue to head straight to Ikea to do the job.

Be still, my heart! Today I have decided to be a baker/chef/whatever will make it appropriate for me to come to Penzey's Spices every day for the rest of my life. Folks, what we have here is the motherload of spices, nestled in the cutest darn shop ever. I love the seemingly never ending selection, and they have strategically placed recipe cards throughout the store for people like me who don't know the first thing about cooking. Brilliant! I bought a really cute little gift box with four different spices for my grandma for Christmas  for only $7.95, and yes, I'm serious. I am so excited to come back here soon soon soon!

If you haven't been to the Cornish Pasty (pronounced past-tee), you have not really seen the heart of Tempe. It's a little place, not really good for groups or kiddos, but when you enter you truly fee the atmosphere shift, and guess what? Now you're part of the cool crowd. The food is so good! I love their mushy peas for a starter (although half of the time they are out) and then the Pilgrim to seal the deal. It's like a Thanksgiving party in your mouth any time of the year! All of their food is great, and this place is always busy it seems. Don't come on a Friday or Saturday night unless you like being in small spaces with a million loud drunks. Mid-afternoon is the best. The servers are usually pleasant, but some have a better-than-you hipster attitude. But hey, if you haven't been here yet, you're missing out on Tempe's best kept secret!

The love of my life, right here. I said earlier that the Cornish Pasty is the best kept secret in Tempe, but I take that back. It is the Valley Art. I just...I don't even know where to begin. Every movie I have seen here has been a complete win in my book. This past year they played all of the nominated animated shorts for the Academy Awards, and then the live action shorts the following week. How sweet is that?! It is never crowded here. Always relaxed, and it usually brings an older crowd, which I quite enjoy. I hate young wipper snappers ruining perfectly good movie dates. I loved The Drummond Will (go rent it, now) and Rare Exports (scary Santa!), and it's such a shame that these kind of movies aren't shared with every inhabitant on this Earth. I feel like when I am here, I am part of an elite club. I just really love Harkins Theatres in general, but this one (which is also the very first one) is my favorite, and only a short walk from my house! Yay!

This is by far my favorite hotel in the valley. If I had just a little bit more money, I'd probably live here. This is a great getaway spot for my husband and me - we love the spacious bathrooms with the neat lighting and the big tubs! I feel like some kind of A-list celebrity coming here, and although I have yet to spend the day by the pool, I hear it is the place to be (but you'll need a room key and your ID to get access). Even though I live about 15 minutes from here, I still love to indulge by coming here when I have the time and money. Even though it is sometimes pricey, I think it is worth every penny. My husband's 30th birthday is in February and I'm sure he would love to celebrate in one of their bigger suites with a few friends (he is also a big fan). I will definitely be back soon.

I have been to the Valley Ho many times and confidently gave them a five star rating in the past. However, my last experience made me question whether I'll ever stay here again. I have waited some time to write this review because I don't want to write it out of resentment. So, here's to hoping I can be as objective as I can.  In past visits, I have witnessed many people having large paries here. Bachelor and bachelorette parties, birthday parties, weddings, and parties just for the fun of it. This hotel has a swanky, modern party flair. So when my husband's 30th birthday came up in February, I thought the Valley Ho would be a perfect place to host it. I called them about a month in advance and let them know that we were going to have his birthday party here and I rented out the most expensive room at the time (Tower Loft Suite, almost $600 with taxes). The person on the other line did not in any way tell me this isn't allowed. During the month leading up to the party, I made invitations, decorations, and spent hundreds of dollars between food and alcohol/mixers for classy drinks. We rented out the largest room to ensure that it would hold our guests (about 20 people) and I was very clear of our intentions when reserving the room. Fast forward to the day of the party. I was so excited because I had put more effort and time into this party than any I've ever hosted. The valets and bellhops were super nice and helpful. If I could still give them 5 stars, I would. However, when we approached the front desk, I was forced to sign a "no party" waiver. What. My heart dropped into my stomach and I went into panic mode. Since it was the day of, I was unable to get a refund. So there I was with a $600 room, car full of decorations and food, and according to this waiver, not allowed to have more than 4 people in this huge room at once. The group of friends that we invited are very tame, very respectful people. This wasn't going to be a party where people got trashed and created havoc, so I figured we would be quiet enough that we wouldn't bother our neighbors. You have to understand, I had no other choice here. I couldn't call off the party just hours before it started.  So fast forward to 10PM. Nobody is drunk, nobody is being obnoxious, the music is so quiet we could barely hear it, and everybody is behaving themselves like adults. Literally just mingling and talking with each other while a couple of the guys hung out on the balcony. There were maybe 13 people left at this point (I'm telling you, we're not party animals). Then there is a knock on the door and a man and woman in official uniform tell me I need to kick everyone out but 3 other people. Tears started welling up in my eyes and again, I began to panic. It was 10 PM. In downtown Scottsdale. At a supposed swanky party hotel. I was at a loss for words and was forced to sign another paper that said they'd kick us out if we didn't kick our guests out. They weren't friendly, helpful, or apologetic in any way. They shrugged me off when I asked about the other parties going on throughout the hotel. And then they left. When I went back in the room, I had to deliver the bad news to grown adults (some of which had traveled from over an hour away) that we had to move the party from the room to the bar downstairs (my idea to save face). It was humiliating, although our guests did sympathize with me after explaining the situation. We didn't order much at the bar, as we had unlimited drinks and food in the room and we were all pretty disappointed. The party died out pretty quick after that. Let the record show that not one of our guests went home drunk, and I am confident the outcome would have been the same had we stayed in the room.  It frustrates me because I was not warned that parties weren't allowed when I scheduled the reservation, especially since I told him we were going to have a party. However, I had seen several parties going on on the balconies the night of ours. And parties every other time I have ever stayed here. People were yelling and partying at 3 AM that night next door to us. I felt like the staff treated us like we were having a frat party, when in reality, we were very respectful and chose this particular hotel so we could have an upscale, classy party. That $600 could have easily gone toward a different venue that would have happily allowed us to have a classy party.   I felt like this experience was so unfair, both to me who had put so much time, thought, effort, and money into it, and for my husband, who only turns 30 once. We were regulars here, but I don't think I'll ever come back after how we were treated.

Excuse me while I rip out my hair for a moment. I am a nanny for two children, and we were on a quest to find them both Halloween costumes. One of them is terrified of the Spirit Halloween stores in the valley, and this was the only place he wasn't too afraid to go to, so away we went. For starters, this place is dirty, cluttered, and unorganized. The girl I watch had little problem picking out a costume, but the boy couldn't find anything that fit right or met his expectations. Finally, he found a Luigi costume he liked, but they didn't have his size. We left the first night putting the girl's costume on hold (so her mom could pick it up, since they don't take debit cards) and nothing for the boy in hopes of finding his costume at a different Party City. When I picked the kids up from school a couple days later, they had gone with their mom to pay for the girl's costume and buy the boy a Wario costume. The Wario costume in the store had broken when he tried it on, and when he got home, the new costume broke in the exact same place. So we took it back. And he found another costume he liked, and I again had to put his costume on hold for his mom to pick up. The cashier did not write down the mom's name because her pen didn't work and simply said, "I don't need to write down her name... I'll be here." Needless to say, when their mom came home with the costume, a pretty important piece was missing (and it wasn't missing when we put it on hold), and part of the costume was torn. So for a third time, I trekked back to Party City to see if I could get the missing part. In the end, I did get the part with no apology and part of the costume still ripped. Each time we went, the cashiers were extremely unprofessional and obnoxious. I will NEVER step foot in this place again.

As a once poor college student turned working adult, I about pee myself with excitement every time I get the opportunity to come here. I feel like part of some elite club (don't judge!), and the savings! Oh, the savings you'll save! As a newlywed, half of our "big" purchases have come from here, and I don't even feel sort of bad about it. Since it is just my husband and I, we learned the hard way to not stock up on perishable items from Costco, so we leave those types of purchases for the regular grocery store. We use Costco for gas, non-perishable food items, pet supplies, electronics, nutritional supplements, and just about everything else imaginable. And just like any other red blooded American, we unrepentantly try all of the samples and listen to the sales pitches because, hey, free food! And really, we come here just for the fun of coming here, even if we don't need anything at all. Love love love Costco.

I have met my fair share of thift shops over the years, and I feel like Turn Style is one of the least inviting ones I've visited. It feels very stuffy (even though it is in a very open space), boring, and just all around blah. The clothing racks are long rows, which adds to the bleak cafeteria-like feeling, and the clothing sizes are kind of hard to find and follow. You, a petite woman, may have to walk down a seemingly endless row of blouses before you discover that the smalls are on the opposite side of the whole shop.  Now, I know better than to value thrift shop based on its clean, friendly atmosphere. I get it - I'm looking for diamonds in the rough. Thrift shops are often rough, which is fine. The selection of clothing is what appeals (or doesn't appeal) to me. Turn Style was simply "okay" in regards to selection. I found two shirts I liked at reasonable prices. But considering the amount of time I spent there, two shirts really isn't much.  I may or may not return. I don't dislike it here, but I don't think I'd recommend it either. In my limited experience, I just don't think the quality of merchandise and the less than inviting atmosphere is worth a second trip.

I am a regular at Pei Wei, and I get the same thing every time. I don't care for chicken, so I get a side of the lo mein noodles with lo mein sauce without chicken. It costs a whopping $1.95 and totally fills me up! I also love their edamame and crab wontons. Sooo yummy! First you order your food at the front, and then choose a seat and your food comes out in no time. I love that even though this isn't your standard sit down restaurant with a waiter, it is still classy and the staff takes care of you well. Don't forget to leave a couple bucks behind, especially if you made a mess, since their staff comes and cleans your table. Great food for a great price. I am thinking I want some Pei Wei for dinner tonight.

I have been a sucker wayy too long. The gym is just okay, but the staff has no idea what they're doing. Either that, or they don't care about their customers one bit... as long as they're taking your money, it doesn't matter if you're satisfied. My husband, brother-in-law, and me have been on the same bill for who knows how long (the staff told me that we could only use one card to pay for all three of us since it is a family plan, so my brother in law has been paying so we have to pay him back). My brother in law moved maybe two months ago and cancelled his membership. My husband and I hadn't gone in a couple months, so we decided not to update our account with our card. Well, guess what? They had been charging my brother in law for our accounts. Their response was that he never told them not to. It just seems like common courtesy to ASK him before they continue using his card. My husband and I haven't been to the gym since he cancelled his membership, but we still owe over $100 to his brother since they continued charging him. They would not reimburse him AT ALL, even given the circumstances (we hadn't been in even once). All they care about over there is money, even if customers aren't walking through those doors, they're still happy as long as the money keeps rolling in. I have been a member here on two separate occasions and have had awful experiences both times due to staff incompetence. This was just my most recent frustration with them. I will never join again and highly advise everybody and their mother to stay away from this place.

Hooray for fresh food and inventive recipes! The best time to visit Joe's is definitely in the winter months, as the grounds are beautiful to explore and there are picnic tables all over the place! Indoor seating is limited, but if you come during a less busy time, you'll most likely get a seat. The soda fountain, condiment bar, and restrooms (which are awesome) are also outdoors. Joe's Farm Grill is modern, fun, and definitely makes me feel as though I am stepping out of Arizona and onto a beautiful New England property.   Atmosphere aside, the food is very good! The menu offers a big variety and most (or all?) of the produce is grown on site. My husband loves the Ahi burger with wasabi mayonnaise, while my favorite so far has been their hot dogs. I was less than impressed with their wedge salad, but eating a meal that is less than exceptional is fairly rare here. Milkshakes and fries are also phenomenal at Joe's.   Overall, this is one of my favorite restaurants to go to on a beautiful day. I know this review will get muddled with the rest of the outstanding reviews, but I knew I had to review a place as unique, delicious, and special as Joe's Farm Grill.

Okay so I love this place, like, a lot. My husband, on the other hand, hates it. The only time we come here is when he is taking me out to celebrate me or when he just wants to love me well. The food is why I come here. The white pizza and Hawaiian pizza are to die for. The pizzas here are probably my favorite pizzas of all time. The food (even salads and pastas) is easily five star worthy. The reason I give it a four is because it is a chain restaurant. I have become a little snobby when it comes to eating out, and I just wish I could be served the same food in perhaps a different atmosphere. Now, the restaurant is nice and everything, but it is lacking a certain unique and inviting ambiance. I guess I'm just too hipster and cool for this place nowadays. The service is always pretty good here. They used to give out bread before the food came out, but now it is only upon request. I would highly recommend giving this place a try if you are the rare 1% in the Phoenix area who hasn't.

I have been to World Market on various occasions, and I just love everything about it, especially during the Christmas season. The store is always clean and organized, the staff is very friendly, and they have awesome coupons for awesome stuff! World Market has a huge variety of products, from food to wine to toys to kitchen gear to furniture - it's all here, in one wonderful, magical store! I usually don't come here looking for things - it's more like I come here and things find me. Today I walked away with a set of mixing bowls, two adorable polar bear ornaments, and hot chocolate (some of which turns pink - what?!), using a $10 off coupon I received for being a "World Market Explorer" (aka, just give them your damn email address). Seriously love this place and can't wait for them to stock up on even more Christmas decor!

The Tempe Arts Festival rolls around twice a year: Once in March and once in November, if my memory serves me well. Mill Avenue closes down for a weekend and big tents go up, and they fill up with local artists selling their crafts. They have beauty products, paintings, jewelry, statues, clothing, music, and everything in between. I found an amazing handmade steampunk ring for my roommate this past Christmas that she just adores, and I have purchased lots of various gifts here in the past. The food is calorifically delicious, albiet expensive. There is plenty of live entertainment (music and jugglers and all that fun stuff) and even a section for kids to make their own crafts.   I really love having such a lively little (big?) festival so close to my home (biking distance, hooray!), and I'd like to give it five stars, but honestly after coming here twice a year for the past few years, little has changed (if anything). It's always the same vendors, and unfortunately, a lot of the vendors sell the same things (if you're looking for an exhaustive selection of native american art, flock to this place). I'd love to see more variety and novelty in the future. I'll still be making my rounds when it comes to town and perhaps partake in purchasing a few locally made items, but let's change it up a little! If you're a local artist, check it out and see if maybe you should showcase your work here.   Also note that admission is free, so I would highly suggest for you to at least check it out. Nothing to lose!

Is it true that I haven't reviewed Forefathers yet? I am in serious disbelief. Forefathers is like my favorite thing ever ever ever. For starters, the service is so wonderful here. It is family owned, so it definitely has a warm, inviting feel to it. You can watch them cook your sandwich right by the register, and it seems they are always talking with each other, laughing, and having a great time. From pure speculation, I feel like the family that owns it really enjoy each others' company. But I digress.  Their cheesesteak sandwiches are amazing. Melt in your mouth, packed with flavor, fresh and hot off the grill amazing. The words escape me for how unbelievably delicious their sandwiches are. They are messy in the best kind of way - I don't even care how silly I look with greasy flavor dripping off of my elbow. Ten stars for the sandwiches. Fifteen stars for the sandwiches. A million stars for the sandwiches!  The decor is also really great here. Lots of patriotism up in that joint. But seriously, try these guys out. I promise you it will be one of the best sandwiches you'll ever eat.

Let's face it: Arizona is not known for its sushi. Sadly, this girl loves sushi. So A few months back a few girls and I decided to come get drinks here before a night out on the town. The drinks are inventive and delicious with adorable names. The first time around I only got drinks, but liked them and the atmosphere enough to bring friends back who were visiting from another landlocked state. This time, we ordered adorably named drinks and sushi. The sushi was fantastic! I was so impressed with the quality of the food, considering the place was packed with a gagillion people all ordering sushi at once. I have been back a few times since and would highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar. It is fun to watch the chefs, and it is out of the way enough that you don't feel bombarded by the other guests. The last time we went, we even had a great conversation with the chef about his recent trip to Japan. Very entertaining. Sunday nights are obscenely busy for one reason or another (can't remember why, but there is a reason for it) and nighttime in general brings in a rowdier "Scottsdale scene" crowd. But I love it. And I love so much about this place. The best sushi I have had so far in Arizona with great service to boot!

I used to be obsessed with this place, and I still kind of am, but my last few visits were subpar. The atmosphere is always lively and it is usually busy when I go, which is fine for the delicious food I usually get. However, the last few visits I have wanted nothing more than a bread bowl with some basic soup (chicken noodle, tomato, cheddar and broccoli, etc) but out of the four soups of the day, nothing sounded remotely good to me. The last time I went I ordered the roasted sweet potato sandwich, which I thought was pretty gross, and since nobody comes to check on you, I had noone to complain to, so instead I ordered another meal, can't remember which, but I liked it. I really do love this place and will probably not stop coming back - their bread is especially delicious. And the cupcakes? The best around - better than specialized cupcake places. I also love that it is connected to Changing Hands Bookstore. It was just a couple of less than great visits that make me knock this place down a star.

This just popped up on the sidebar of places I've checked in at and have yet to review, and now I'm pretty sure I'm going to go get me a hotdog from Thirsty Dog.  Located in a convenience store, this little bar hosts some of the most magical ingredients ever tasted in regards to hot dogs. I'm genuinely not skilled enough to write a review of just how delicious these dogs are, and for that, I apologize. But just know that they are really, really delicious. All of them. Every combination of everything. So. Good.  I also love how they are open so late. I'm a night owl, so it's nice when a place is open when I need it most.  The fact that it's located in a convenience store does take it down a star, only because  it's a little bit awkward to fit in such a small area and eat while the bartender (dogtender?) tries to look past you to see the TV behind you. Worth it, though, to get a taste of those delicious dogs.  4.49 stars from this girl!

I'm here with my husband at least once a week. The variety of frozen yogurt is fine, but it doesn't change often, but the toppings are out of control! I can't think of a single topping I'd like that they don't have. A wonderland of syrups and sprinkles and mashed up cookies and candies. So good! The interior is usually pretty clean and cute cartoons play from large screens inside. Also, if you check in on Yelp, you get a 25% discount. So cool!!!

My husband and I live right down the street from Taste of Tops, but we don't go nearly enough for how rad it is. We have been a handful of times - all great experiences with great selections of bottled beers and ones on tap with a big variety of prices for every budget. This is a place you meet up with friends you haven't seen in awhile. A great place to talk, laugh, play games, or just be in good company. I love trying new beers, so Taste of Tops is perfect for me. It's also very low key and they don't serve food. You can bring your own food in, order from next door, or whatever. Bartenders are also knowledgeable and great.  As HUGE Breaking Bad fans, my husband and I were so disappointed that we didn't know Taste of Tops showed it weekly on Sunday evenings. We totally would have been there every week, making friends and commiserating over Heisenberg and his antics. So after hearing about the series finale that would be played there, we knew where we had to go. I needed all of the support I could get to get through the last episode. We got there two hours early and drank and played a game with friends. When the episode began, people were incredibly respectful and so into the show. We were home! I loved cheering and laughing with the crowd... the atmosphere was so welcoming and fun! It was by far the best Breaking Bad experience we have ever had (and I've watched every episode twice), and I even won a free beer for my trivia skillllllz. Thank you for the memorable night, Taste of Tops! We will be back for The Walking Dead in a couple weeks!  (Also note that it is incredibly rude to continue to talk when people are trying to enjoy the show playing. Go somewhere else or watch the show. Sorry the world doesn't always revolve around you. Just be considerate or politely move on... it's that easy!)

I visited Tempe Farmers Market a couple years ago when it opened for the first time. It was less than impressive and I had never intended to go back. Fast forward to a couple months ago and my roommate and I decided to stop in because we were simply bored. Let's just say there has been a major improvement! Sure, the produce is somewhat lacking, but all of the dried and frozen goods make up for it. We were greeted by a friendly young man right away who indulged us with great conversation about the art hung around the market and made plenty of recommendations. He was very easy to talk with and knowledgeable about what they carry and what's delicious. I was lucky to have had such a great experience with the customer service. They also recently opened a small coffee bar inside, so check it out if coffee's your thing. This place is a little pricey, but the experience of shopping here is worth it. I feel like a child in a candy store when I visit places like these - I love to try new and interesting foods!   Another huge bonus is that they're open so late. Five stars all around!

I love how unassuming and unique Sleepy Dog is. Nestled in a rather dull shopping strip, this industrial and simultaneously cozy building harbors some delicious beer and good memories. I mean, I don't even like beer, but their "mixed" beers are killer! Keep in mind that beer is what they do, and they do it well. They do not sell food, and in fact, the only food they have is (complimentary) popcorn in the corner of the room. But you are free to BYOF (Bring Your Own Food). People can have pizza delivered, you can bring food you cooked at home, or stop by Los Favoritos down the street and bring in a burrito (my personal favorite).   I give this place five stars because it is so relaxed. You can bring in your own food, and they have a stack of board games in the corner to play. I LOVE board games. Being able to play games and eat whatever I want while sipping on some good drinks was an excellent way to spend time with friends, and then again with my husband. Love it here. I'll be back again and again, I'm sure of it.

My husband and I are big fans of Fox Concept restaurants and have been lusting over coming here for quite some time. My husband turned 30 earlier this month, and we were so excited to finally visit Modern Steak to celebrate. I called a couple weeks in advance for a reservation. The girl who answered was polite, but I had to keep repeating the information before she finally had it right. I told her we would be celebrating my husband's 30th and that we had never been in. I asked her for one of the best seats and she said she'd set us up with a cute booth. Fast forward to his birthday. Now, I want to start with the positive here. The atmosphere is lovely and you would never know you were inside of a mall. Very classy, modern, and overall visually appealing (the girls bathroom seals the deal, too!). I ordered the 8 oz midwest prime beef filet. Let me just say that it was to die for. Literally the BEST steak I have ever had the pleasure of eating. Fan-freaking-tastic. Hubby ordered 18 oz herb crusted rib eye. He loved his as well and thought it was very flavorful. Overall, the food easily wins 5 stars. My only complaint is that not one person wished my husband a happy birthday. Not the hostess, not the server, noone. This made me sad considering on his birthday last year I took him out to another nice restaurant (The Cork) and they had "Happy 29th Birthday, Kevin" engraved on the menu. The booth we sat in at Modern Steak was near the kitchen, which is usually not a popular spot to sit in so I'm not sure if the girl who made the reservation really chose that spot for us. Luckily, my husband loves watching the chefs. I would absolutely come back despite nobody acknowledging such a special milestone for him. But it's the food alone that would bring me back. Best. Steak. Ever.

Be still my beating heart! Thrifting brings me so much joy, and when I found out about a thrift store that benefits animals, I was so excited! I got two of my kitties from AHS and love knowing I can support them in other ways than going in and playing with the animals (because God knows I'd bring them all home with me). Not only is it a great cause, but their selection is excellent! It smells like a thrift shop, it looks like a thrift shop, but to me, it is the best place to find designer clothing and cute home decor. They also do half off every other Saturday and $1 clothing days a couple days a week. It is my wonderland!  So if you've not had a chance to check this place out, please do! You never know what you might find.

I feel like my five stars aren't even necessary here, but I just needed to agree with everyone else here that Jason is a badass insect warrior. He is personable, punctual, and he really knows what he is doing. We wish we were friends with him outside of professional world, but that is beside the point. We had cockroaches. Lots and lots of cockroaches. After researching options here on Yelp, my husband was blown away by this company's reviews. So within a couple of days, Jason came over and exterminated those beasts like noones business. I wasn't here for the initial visit (thank God), but Kevin later told me that when he sprayed poison in the hole in our diswasher/wall, cockroaches came pouring out. Since that first visit 6-ish months ago, we have asked Jason to come out two more times. The poison he uses works for a long time, so occasionally we see dead cockroaches in our house, which is much much better than alive ones. I'd like to say that our roach problem is long gone, but unfortunately we have to get a plumber out here because Jason thinks they are getting in through the plumbing, which he can't do anything about except kill them once they have come out. It is such a relief that our house is protected by all the other bugs out there too. I see really strange dead insects around the outside of our house and I breathe a sigh of relief that I didn't find them on my pillow and thank Jesus again for Lights Out Exterminating.

I really don't like hamburgers that much. I know this makes me un-American, but it is what it is. I was at one point dragged to this place since a bunch of friends were meeting up and I wasn't about to miss out on fun times because I don't like burgers. So, I sucked it up and went. There is a huge cow mural on the wall, beckoning you to eat him, or one of his family members. So far, so good. I ordered a few drinks, all of which were very good (although pricey). I got the Kobe burger, and good God was it delicious! It melts in your mouth, and all of the flavor is there, stewing in the juices of this mighty burger. I have been back here several times since and without kicking and screaming. This is the only burger place I really enjoy coming back to. Also, the milkshakes are to die for (cookies n cream FTW!). Go check these guys out. Soooo yummy!

I feel like a kid in candy store when I come here... oh, wait... I guess I am a kid in a candy store! And it is oh so glorious! Every aisle, every corner, and every wall is packed with an amazing assortment of candies. They have old school candies, new school candies, rare candies, bulk candies, and everything in between. There are even a lot of candies I have never heard of! The only reason I can't give this place a 5 star rating is because of the steep prices. They make me sad. So if you are planning on loading up on Snickers or Skittles, go elsewhere. The prices have been jacked up here, so I recommend going to Target for that stuff. But for the rarer, hard to find candies? These guys have everything! It is by far the biggest and best candy store of all Arizona, and I can't wait to come back here!

Bosa Donuts, how I love thee. I come here with my husband from time to time and get a dozen doughnuts that lasts us all week. It seems like this place is always stocked up on the right doughnuts, and they are always fresh when we get them. Their glazed ones are to die for, as are many of their other varieties. The employees are always SUPER friendly and this place just overall rocks my socks off. Bosa FTW!

In love. I have two tattoos now, the most recent one being from Golden Rule. I had such a bad experience with my first one that I was hesitant to do another. A friend of mine recommended this shop, and I finally worked up the nerve to get another. Alex Empty tattooed two anchors on my collar bone that I absolutely adore. I get compliments left and right and the design and colors are beautiful. I am so happy with the outcome. But as with many people, some of the ink didn't stick. Alex went out of his way to text me and ask when I could come get them touched up. He really takes pride in his work and cares about his clients, which is a staple for all excellent tattoo artists. I got them touched up today and am so excited to see how they will heal. My husband also got his feet tattooed by Alex and he loves them. I am going in for another big piece with Alex in the coming months that  I am excited about, and I know my husband will be back as well. As long as he's in Phoenix, Alex will be our tattoo artist for sure.   I also think it is important to note that from what I have seen, the other guys in the shop are also extremely talented, laid back, and unpretentious. I'd recommend them all.

Just...what...how? But...I just... Ahh this place is so so good! From the cheery greetings from the sweet Swedish family running the joint to those mouth watering, melt-in-your mouth Swedish meatballs, this place is seriously the bees knees.  Like, I could take a bath in the meatball gravy all day long. Thats how good this place is. Make sure you go when you have plenty of time - they make everything homemade just for you with plenty of care (and magic, methinks), so sometimes you just gotta wait. The ambience has sort of a cafeteria feel, but do not let this fool you! You are literally sitting in a gold mine of tasty treats. My husband really likes the pork schnitzel cordon bleu, and I think they said it was their most popular meal. Gosh, if you haven't been to Beaver Choice, please go right now. Cancel your meetings and hair appointments and kids' soccer games. All of that can wait in the name of delicious Swedish meat!

This place is ah-may-zing. The menu is unique, the food is high quality, the prices are right, the ambiance is cool and laid back, and the employees/owners are super friendly and genuinely happy to have you there. Now, I am the kind of person who will get something on their first visit, enjoy it, and then get nothing but that item every time they visit. At Brosenbrus, it is the Tomato, Basil, Mozzarella sandwich. Every once in awhile, I'll change it up, and it is always delicious (i.e., The Stacked Philli), but I always come back around to this delicious stack of deliciousness. They have recently began selling baked goods, and those are equally tasty. They have a happy hour, which makes their already reasonably prices even lower. Come check these guys out... You will not be disappointed!!

Thrice I have visited Beckett's Table, and thrice I have enjoyed it. The vibe is cool, modern, and mellow. The first time around, we went with a large group of friends. We got the grilled cheese appetizer to start, and then I ordered the chicken and dumplings. The appetizer was rich and delicious and I have ordered it every visit since. The chicken and dumplings, however, were underwhelming, which is probably why I had forgotten about them when I went the second time and ordered them again. The chicken and dumplings is the sole reason Beckett's doesn't get a five stars from me. I mean, if the meal wasn't good the first time, and then a year later they haven't improved it or removed it from the menu, then that's your bad, Beckett's Table. Even the waiter tonight admitted to it being bland (although he said it in a much kinder way). Tonight, however, I remembered to stray from the plain, boring meal that had plagued me the two previous times, and ordered the short ribs instead. Good golly, what a difference that little meal made! It was absolutely delicious and could easily be pulled apart by my fork alone. The short ribs melted in my mouth along with the creamy mashed potatoes. Seriously good. The service tonight was also right on par. Our table of six never ran low on drinks, and our server was quite patient with all of the questions we had regarding the menu and specials. My mother-in-law enjoyed the experience tonight so much, that she asked to speak directly with the manager to tell her how wonderful the service and food was. Beckett's Table, you're lucky I waited so long to write this review - It wouldn't have been as glowing last time. But you have earned yourself a solid 4, maybe even 4.5, stars from this girl.

Now where is that six star button? Honestly, a couple months ago my husband and I spent an entire day with the owner, Johanna, literally designing, molding, and creating each other's wedding bands from scratch.   Yes, you heard me right. We MADE each other's wedding bands. Three words: Best. Date. Ever.  We chose to make ours in sterling silver (I'm allergic to gold), but you can also make gold rings as well. In a matter of 5 hours, we turned a couple beads of silver into two gorgeous wedding bands. Johanna was amazing, and walked us through every step. She made herself totally available for the whole day and was so helpful and patient. We knew nothing about the process, and not only did she show us what to do, but she explained why we did it that way. My husband made me a small, delicate braided band, and I made him a very masculine band with comfort grip and a matte finish. Both turned out flawless and stunning, thanks to all of the support from the owner. There are also options to set stones in the rings, but for now we're sticking with the beautifully simple bands that our friends and family are always oohing and aahhing at. Plus, who else can say that they literally made their significant other's ring with their bare hands?  Harold Studio also offers classes, which I am dying to try! Some of the jewelry they make out there is amazing. They are even making dog tags this season! So creative!  All around a great date, a learning process, and excellent products that we will cherish for the rest of our lives!

I came here for lunch with my mother-in-law and sister-in-law as the start to a girls' day out. I have been all over the Scottsdale scene, so it's a wonder it took me so long to get around to trying this place out. Let me begin by saying that this cafe is ADORABLE. I can't imagine a cuter lunch place if I tried and I'd come here again and again just for the sweet atmosphere. The service was quick and we were well attended to. My only qualm is that the menu is somewhat limited. There is a giant list of salads with an additional small list of meals that all included goat cheese or brie, which I am not fond of. In the end, I chose a strawberry salad. It was fine, but I don't really like salads, so for all I know it was the greatest salad ever and I just do not have the right palate to judge salads. But lucky for Arcadia Farms, the experience is more important to me than the food itself, and I had a great time. I will most likely return, as I am just totally in love with this beautiful little gem.

Mill Ave has been missing a good breakfast nook, and it has made me very sad. Until now! The atmosphere is very modern. The color scheme is gray, orange, and black and boy do they stick to it, down to the orange frosted cupcakes. Impressive. I had the best french toast I have ever had in my life right here at NCounter. I have only eaten here once, and usually I don't give five stars out after the first visit, but this place is THAT good. So happy to have such a fabulous breakfast restaurant so close to home.

The. Love. Of. My. Life. Ted Baker is my absolute favorite designer and this is my very favorite place to shop when I'm feeling indulgent. Other than the quality clothing, the customer service is amazing. Easily the best customer service I have ever experienced anywhere ever. It's like we're right at home when we stop in, even if we aren't looking to buy anything at all. The people who work here always remember us and can even remember the conversations we've had in the past. It's not like we live here or anything, we come maybe once a month if that. Now, the variety is more limited than, say, the San Francisco location, but we still prefer the one in Scottsdale because of the amazing people who work there. Ted Baker, you make me so so happy!

My husband and I purchased our first home in June of 2009, and John Gluch was (and still is!) an incredible realtor who patiently and thoroughly walked us through every step of the process. We naturally felt overwhelmed when beginning our hunt, but immediately felt at ease with John. He was very attentive to our specific needs and went above and beyond in every aspect to find us the perfect home.  After visiting a half dozen houses or so, my husband and I fell in love with the home I am now sitting in, typing this review. It initially needed a little love, but John provided us with great resources and connections so we could begin renovating our home, which was surprisingly fun (yes, it was just like the movies, playing with color swatches, carpet samples, and bathroom tiles) and stress free. The location of the house, the neighborhood, the layout, the size, and the price were perfectly on point to what we were looking for. Everything about our home is better than we could have dreamed for a first home. We are abundantly thankful for John's hard work and continued presence and advice when it comes to homeownership.  John Gluch is very knowledgeable about the housing market in the East Valley, and he is highly regarded and well respected within the community. I would recommend him to anybody in the East Valley who isn't just looking to purchase a house, but a home. He genuinely cares about the small, seemingly minute details that many other realtors would likely look over. Please, if you're looking to purchase a home in the near future, do not miss the opportunity to work with John. I assure you, you will be so thankful for such a caring, knowledgeable, and hard working realtor!

5 star review to a 5 star update. I don't have many of those floating around in the reviews I've written!  First, my husband and I are still residing in the home we purchased with John six years ago. We love our Tempe home more than ever, and, as an added bonus, it has DOUBLED its value since we bought it. We could not imagine a better experience with an agent who had masterful foresight. I'm not saying John can see into the future, but he definitely ensured ours was bright!  Additionally, we have recommended John to several friends who all landed their perfect first homes as well, and they have had nothing but great things to say about the experience. They felt heard, cared for, and safeguarded against what could be a very intimidating experience. John, if you're reading this, I would also like to selfishly thank you for hooking them up with homes in our neighborhood. We salute you.  My parents will be selling my childhood home in Chandler this summer and of course I will recommend the Gluch Group, and I can do so with even more confidence now that they have a full team to service my family.   Finally, can we talk about the macaroons the Gluch Group delivered to my door, just because? The affinity I feel for you guys is never ending. Thanks for being you in the best way possible!   To many more years of referring the world to you!

Cupcakes are my favorite desserts ever, and I about died when I was given a dozen mini cupcakes from Gigi's for Christmas. They were easily the best cupcakes I've ever had! I have had many many cupcakes from upscale bakeries (think Sprinkles and Caketini), but they all pale in comparison to Gigi's. I especially love their chocolate cupcakes, but they're all amazing and you can't go wrong. I'm only knocking them a star because it's so expensive. It cost me $7 for two (full sized) cupcakes! To me, it was worth it, but it might not be for everybody, so be wary!

Got takeout from Miu's tonight. We initially planned on dining in, but upon our arrival, we quickly realized that it was way too awkward and weird, even for us, so we opted for takeout. Let me explain. The inside feels like an elementary school cafeteria, minus the chittering of small children. In fact, not only were there no children screams, but there were no sounds at all. It was silent. No music or even an air conditioning vent murmuring. There were about three tables of people and they were all whispering. It was WEIRD. We still wanted to try the food so sat down and looked at the menu. We ordered takeout and waited 40 minutes. Finally, the server (the only one we ever saw, and she was very nice and accommodating, for the record) gave us our food and the check and off we went.  We ordered the Pork Belly in Garlic Sauce (spicy), the Dan Dan noodles (REALLY spicy), the Kung Pao Chicken, and the Beef Lo Mein. The beef Lo Mein was decent, the pork belly was sub par (albiet very interesting for those who like something different), and the dan dan noodles were just bad. I didn't try the kung pao chicken, but my husband seemed to like it.  Overall, I'd probably not come back. It wasn't great, the establishment lacks any kind of comfortable homey feel, and the food took forever to come out. A solid 2 stars, as the food wasn't inedible and the server was very sweet.

It's not often an establishment gets five stars simply based off of the food. The location isn't great unless you work at a nearby business (this location is closed on Saturdays and Sundays because I presume 99% of their customer base comes from the big businesses nearby), the atmosphere itself is pretty boring and fast food-y, but OH GOD THE FOOD. There used to be a location much closer to my home, and I would find myself gorging on their food all the time, but it shut down, and now I happily drive 15 minutes each way to indulge in their delicious delicious chicken teriyaki wraps. Honestly, Samurai Sam's is the quickest (and cheapest) way to my heart. I don't care about the dull atmosphere or the inconvenient location. It's all about their wraps, and if you haven't tried one, stop what your doing and go! Go right this minute! And if it's a Saturday, go ahead and camp out until Monday. Because their food really is THAT good.
