I've been a big fan of E's Urban Hair, and particularly my stylist Kristin Isaac, since I started coming here two years ago. Before that, I always hated going to the salon (so boring!)   But nothing is boring about Urban Hair - as soon as you walk through the door you are transported into Ethan's alternate universe. You know, it's the way you would decorate your house if you were more brave and didn't love Pottery Barn so much.   Kristin is great at listening to what you want and having her own ideas to share as well. My favorite thing about her as a stylist is her perfectionism. It may seem like your haircut takes forever sometimes, but you will love it when you go home and don't have those weird wonky pieces of hair that you have to try to cut yourself. She is really good at learning about how your particular hair works, too, after a few cuts. She will say "this won't work so well on you because your hair is heavy at the bottom. Let's try this instead."  Just go - you won't be sorry!

This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley. It's my go-to place to take out of town guests. The stetson chopped salad never disappoints, and most of the entrees are delicious (didn't much care for the capon). One recent Saturday during lunch I had scallops with beet risotto and goat cheese that was especially divine. Great wine list with some excellent selections by the glass. Service has always been prompt and friendly.

I went to Atlas Bistro the first time a few years ago for an anniversary dinner...I remember it being delish, if a little heavy on the foie gras (I know, I know...I'm just not that big of a fan). We had ordered the chef's tasting menu.   I tried again for Restaurant Week with a friend, and it was as delicious as I remembered. I started with sweet chile veal sweetbreads over creamed corn (good, but the flavor was a little reminiscent of sweet and sour fried pork takeout Chinese), salmon skin salad and grilled swordfish over white beans with local sausage and pepperonata. Loved the beans with sliced sausage, and the swordfish was meaty and fresh. My dining partner started with gnocchi with cauliflower and mushrooms, had a grilled romaine salad with anchovies and an over-easy egg on the top, and a pork porterhouse with ginger butter (?) After trying her dishes, I wished I wouldn't have ordered all of my selections, but they came recommended by the server. Her gnocchi starter was crave-able.   Love the attached wine store (the girl that worked there helped us pick out an amazing malbec), and the general ambiance of Atlas Bistro. It's friendly and not at all stuffy.

LOVE Classic Italian Pizza. I don't ever really crave pizza, but this is fantastic. My fave is the Sole Mio, which has ham, mushrooms, and a fried egg. It's not on the menu anymore, but they will make it if you ask for it.  Great service, prompt and friendly. Warm, comfortable restaurant. Great place for a date with someone you have been dating for a while.   The only complaint would be the salads. They aren't terrible, but they aren't amazing either. If you're looking for an appetizer, the Brick Oven Bread or the proscuitto wrapped asparagus is a better option.

My favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Delicious, affordable, fun. I want to go every weekend, and have probably eaten here 10 times in several months.   Get the Hot and Sour Soup and the Sugar Cane Pork. You won't be disappointed. I also love the Hong Kong Flat Rice, Spicy wontons (filled with pepperjack cheese and chicken with wasabi dipping sauce), and "Volcano Flamed" beef. The food is very spicy and not for the faint of heart. You will drink a lot of water with dinner, but that's okay because water is good for you. It's also a good balance to the delicious martinis that the bar concocts. Favorites include the Sweet Karma (really not that sweet lychee martini) and Hot and Dirty (habanero infused dirty martini).   We just had my fiance's 35th birthday party here. I made reservations on Thursday for dinner on Saturday night. The restaurant was fantastic for a big group (20 persons). Rather than order classic "tapas style," I chose some of my favorites and the chef created a 6 course dinner for us at a set price-point per person (no confusion once the check arrives). Service was phenomenal, and all of our guests fell in love with the restaurant and the food. I think I may have converted a whole new group of people to Sens-ophiles.

YUM!  I was already a fan of the competitor MoJo, but after trying the red velvet cake flavor at Yogurtology I think I'm hooked. I know they change their flavors, but must they? Red velvet frozen yogurt with yogurt chips, chocolate chips, and fruit is DIVINE.   Cute atmosphere, many flavors to choose from, and some unique and yummy-sounding toppings combined with a friendly and helpful staff.

I was so excited to try out this new place for restaurant week. It's really hard to find...but cute inside once you get there. My party of 4 had reservations, but we still had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. Our server brought us glasses of sangria (we didn't even notice at first that sangria came with the restaurant week menu, yay for free drinks!) Their red wine sangria was really good, with a nice star anise flavor.   For restaurant week, you split an appetizer with your dining companion, each had an entree (either 2 tacos or 1 burrito) and share dessert. We started with the taco salad, which was really tasty and spicy. I liked the chipotle ranch dressing and strips of tortilla on the top.   I ordered the shrimp and barbacoa beef tacos - it said the beef is braised in Dr. Pepper. Interesting...they were out of shrimp and had to sub fish. The tacos came wrapped in 2 little corn tortillas, but they still fell apart when you pick them up. They were stuffed with things...but overall lacked flavor. I didn't finish either taco. We asked at this point for chips and salsa, which were brought out but horrible. I think we all ate one (burned) chip, with really thick, tomato-ey salsa with no freshness or kick.  At least you can't mess up dessert, right? I think it was a churro, but I wouldn't know because they were out. This happened the first day of restaurant week, about 730pm. They obviously didn't plan for restaurant week very well, because we didn't get dessert or and shrimp tacos. The waitress offered to get us another glass of sangria for dessert, but by this time we wanted to leave.   Skip it.

I was in Vegas for a friend's 30th birthday over Valentine's Day weekend. As she is Greek and she hadn't visited the Cosmopolitan yet, she thought it was a sure bet to eat at Estiatorio Milos for dinner.   Not so much.  We didn't get seated until almost an hour after our reservation (with the restaurant continually telling us that our table was being set up). If the hostess had just said "hey, we are running behind. Why don't you get a drink at the bar?" we would have been more than happy to do so. Instead, when we were seated we were all starving and not all all tipsy. A glass of wine would have been a good relaxant to prepare for what was coming next.   The restaurant brought bread, but no water. As the whole table was starving, we were trying to eat the dry bread with no water, choking. No menus. No silverware. Getting a glass of wine took 40 minutes, every time. After countless service frustrations, a member of our party asked to speak to a manager. She then repeated that request several more times throughout the meal to our server. The manager did not ever present himself during our meal. At the end, we tracked him down and recounted our service ordeal (he was the guy I had complained to earlier who told me he was a sommelier). He never did apologize, in the end trying to explain our issues to him was a waste of breath. We weren't looking for a reduction in the bill. We just wanted a "I'm sorry. That is unacceptable."  The only saving grace for this restaurant is the food. It was divine. We ordered 2 roasted fish(es?), a bunch of sides, salads and appetizers. The octopus, snapper, and beets with goat cheese really stood out. I also enjoyed the tomato salad - simple and delicious. Some people at the table ordered seared tuna, which was apparently not as impressive as the whole roasted fish. There were 11 of us at dinner, we did not order bottles of wine (but did have a few glasses), and our bill was $1400. Ouch.   The space is beautiful, as is the Cosmopolitan. The service is so horrible it will ruin your evening. No matter how good the food is, I will never return to this restaurant. I cannot reward such bad behavior with a return trip. When people are paying more than $100 per person for dinner, they expect to be treated with at least a little bit of respect.

Shain is amazing. He makes sure my pool is taken care of, is here when he says he will be here. He replaces what needs replacing but doesn't try to replace things that don't in order to make extra money. He treats his customers how he would like to be treated and it shows.
