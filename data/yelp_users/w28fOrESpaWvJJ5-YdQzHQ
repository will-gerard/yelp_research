This is by far the best pho place in the valley, ive been to a few around town, and the food and prices are the best i have found. I only gave 4 stars because the service was excellent but could use some improvement on their attention to water levels. Other than that 5/5 great portions, great prices, great taste and atmoaphere

2nd time here First time was fine because it was busy and there were workers walking around However this time there are open tables and the service has gotten worse, as in when we walked in the host walked away bearly saying a word and practically threw the menues on the table and walked away. They took our order and were out of my gf's first choice. Then when the garneshes were brought they forgot the culantro (sp). Our water glasses were empty as i asked for the culantro (again sp), they brought a small plate of a few leves that was fine for me, and did not fill the water cups.  I have been going to pho restaurants for years in Hi and Az, this will be our last time dining here, or maybe 3rd times a charm if we do not find a better place
