My experience here must have been quite the exception as reviews and friends experiences seems well. I feel my 2 stars was generous. Other than the manager, most else was a zero. Dined here after the Cardinals game on a Saturday night around 10:30. Was glad to see that they were open to 12:00. After being seated it took 10 min + to be greeted despite only a few tables in the restaurant . By the time the manager stopped by we were talking about going elsewhere. We should have!  Eventually ordered a large half garden, half margarita. That's it.  It came pretty quick but after the first bite (garden side) the pizza was disappointing. No flavor and they forgot the tomato sauce. Thankfully the manager was quick to check in and quickly offered to make another. The new pie was better but somewhat watery. The crust was good but it still needed a ton of Parmesan and garlic power to have much flavor. The margarita side was better but also need excessive Parmesan to taste well.  When it came time to check out it took several minutes to track down the waitress but not that big of a deal. We had a decent amount of pizza left over to box up which was boxed for us. Surprisingly it came back piled up into one small box. Is this normal to box pizza in a pile??? Wish I had taken a picture! Kind of comical at this point of the experience.

This place is like a hidden gem, hiding in plain site as its on a busy street. Everything was better than expected.

Have been here a few times and always one it. Has never been too busy, service more than excellent, and sushi some of the best.
