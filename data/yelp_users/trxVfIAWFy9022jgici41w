Fuâ‚¬$ing yes, downtown Phoenix is pretty lame other then for a convention and the standard chotsky sports bats bay the convention center wear thin quickly but I saw this place on yelp and gave it a shot and walked into the Sublime version of Scarlett Begonias playing, saw on of my favorite obscure brands of scotch on the wall and noticed the rueban dip app on the menu and it was awesome and got good clean and quick old school bar service,  this place is winning

I went to this buffet with a friend with a lot of rewards points or some kind of vip club status so we were able to go to the front of the line and let me say that if I had waited in the crazy long line that was there I would have been super pissed and that is one of the main reasons I am dropping this review to 2 stars.  If it had not been for the long line I and the price would have been reasonable I might have given 4 stars because as for buffet food the quality and choice was good, NOT amazing but good.  The atmosphere was nice, good decor and service on par but for the price and long line.... Meh, there are better choices in Vegas

Awesome chorizo omelet at a fair price and very fast service. Nice selection of teas and a cute little place, I would go back for sure. They could be a bit more modern on some things and some better lighting and light music would be cool but it's a solid place
