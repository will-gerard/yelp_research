Just came in with my husband for my 6 month ring inspection. It was a Monday afternoon so nobody was in there except like maybe 2 customers. We were not greeted upon entering so my husband walked up to a group of employees who were laughing and joking around to ask for help. They literally ignored him, just let him stand there looking stupid for a good 2-3 minutes. So we walked around the counter obviously looking for some help and had to practically wave our hand in the air and shout before someone would finally help us. Unbelievable customer service. Would not come to this branch if I were you. We definitely did not feel like we were worth a minute of their time.

Great prices and great service. I came in for a gel manicure and pedicure, the staff helped me right away. The salon was clean and organized and I was really pleased with my nails. I will definitely be back.
