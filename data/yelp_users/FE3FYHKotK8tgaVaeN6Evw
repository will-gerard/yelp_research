Just got the first food I've had today due to a long work day and the gal.at the drive thru was so nice and cheerful it made my day. Best way to end the night with a good burger and a pleasant and quick experience.

First time they served me oatmeal in a cup. Second time they have no hot chocolate and I still had to wait in the drive thru. Unsure why the management staff is unable to order the right amount of inventory. Im not giving a 3rd chance to be disappointed.

I have been coming here for over 10 years and cannot say enough nice things, although there are no appointments nothing can be perfect. Both vets (dad and son) are amazing with great puppy side manner. They never up sell, are honest when you need it the most and I always leave with a smile while my pooch leaves healthy and waging her now 10 year old tail. I came here with my first rescue puppy and know as long as the building stands they will always have my business.

I would eat here everyday if that wasn't considered eatery stalking, plus who knows the looks I would get. I love the pad thai with shrimp and extra peanuts! I said it!  Come on down, I will probably be there.

Adore the family that owns it. I love the cashew chicken and the crab puffs are amazing. Give this place a shot and I am sure you will keep their number saved in your contacts !
