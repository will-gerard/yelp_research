Vivian and Tammy did such a great job! I went in right when they had closed and they had the best customer service! They unlocked the door and even double teamed it so I could have fabulous hands and nails for my weekend! Amazing! Plus my nails and toes look GREAT!

They don't like gays. Straight up got kicked out for laughing(at a comedy show) and was told they don't like our kind. I tried to pay my tab after they yelled at me mid meal and then wouldn't accept my payment. Weirdest thing ever.

Manager extremely rude. Messed up my order and gave me a pizza with nothing but sauce and the crust... No cheese, no toppings... When I called back the manager told me that's what I had ordered and it was my fault. Never in my life have I encountered a manager like that. HOW THE HECK DID THIS GUY GET PROMOTED?

I've been taking my shihtzus there for about a year now and absolutely love Smelly Dog and their staff. They are always so pleasant and helpful and my pups love them. Make sure you call at least a week in advance for an appointment, however, sometimes they have cancelations so a day of appointment is possible!

Very delicious! This place has a fun and intimate atmosphere. There isn't a lot of seating inside but the food is very good.

Food is good, but placed an order on grubhub and  delivery time was almost 2 hours. I had to call the restaurant several times and when the delivery driver showed up he used the excuse that he had been pulled over. I ordered the family combo meal and was shorted on 2 soups. The portion for the salad, pickles, hummus, and yogurt was very small. I felt like I was probably shorted on that as well. Food is decent but can get better service without being shorted on food from other locations. Disappointed.

Everything is simply amazing. I would recommend this quant establishment to anyone in the area. I'm obsessed with the beignets! They take special requests on sweets. Great cheese selection, wine selection, and beer selection. They have cute gift ideas as well! Come for breakfast, lunch, or dinner and you are sure to leave full and with a smile on your face.

Probably the best customer service experience I have ever received. All around 10stars!!! We were down the street and walked the boys in without an appointment, they were more than happy to help us out. We were greeted with arms wide open and friendly smiles!! Our 3 furbabies were treated like super stars and look amazing! They use very good quality product, these furry boys smell so fancy. This is definitely the boys new spa spot

We went in and sat at the bar. I was quickly and pleasantly surprised by the cool and calm atmosphere. Drinks were amazing: We had the bubbling hibiscus, southwest mule kick, and royal bijou. The bartender was attentive, professional, and had a wonderful personality. The menu was diverse offering many house specials (I recommend trying one of the specials!!) We had the burger special, corduroy burger, and lemony chicken. Great choice of side with the burgers! They offer several size plates which makes this a great spot to stop in for a drink and snack or a full fledge meal. Highly recommend trying this place out.
