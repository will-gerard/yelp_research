This location does not even compare to the Chandler location.

This is a great place to hang out, whether you are with your entire noisy family or just two adults enjoying some time alone.  I have heard that there are many wonderful salads and pastas to try, but we cannot bring ourselves to order anything but the thin crust pizza!  It is awesome!

We've spent two weekends here in the last year and had a wonderful time! The rooms are very clean and comfortable. Drinks and dining are reasonable. We will definitely come back!

The Sunday Brunch Buffet is worth every penny! There is an amazing amount of seafood, a carving station with ham, lamb and prime rib. There was every type of desert you could think of. Everything we tried was wonderful. The three mimosas that were included were pretty good as well. I'm looking forward to going again soon.

It's sad when you can say that Denny's has a better chicken fried steak, but it is the truth! The gravy was bland and the steak was like cardboard.  Maybe if they had Tabasco to add some flavor it wouldn't have been so bad, but they don't have Tabasco!?  I did enjoy the Mimosa.
