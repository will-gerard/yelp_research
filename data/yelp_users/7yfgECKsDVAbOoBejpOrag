I've been going to Phoenix Skin for PicoSure laser tattoo removal treatments and am horrified by my results. I make sure to be very diligent with post-care and avoided the sun for 2 months before continuing treatment on my tattoo (I make sure to only go during winter months as an extra precaution since the sun can be very damaging to the healing process.) I have suffered significant SCARRING as the result of my last 2 treatments here!  The decision to get rid of a tattoo that once made me self-conscious has only been made worse by having a scar to replace it. The last time I was in the office was February/March and I noticed scarring so I discontinued treatments for 7/8 months to see if it would get better with time. When I went in to see the laser tech (mind you, this is not performed by a physician) she noticed the scarring and commented, "oh looks like the last treatment was probably a little too much, huh?" No sympathy for the damaged skin she caused.   I initially liked Phoenix Skin and was planning on doing additional services after my PicoSure treatments were done. Now I am steering clear because of the lack of proper care I've received as a result of this practice.

I LOVE this place, so it really shocks me to see negative reviews. I have a totally different experience when I come here and there are always a lot of people here with nice cars as well, including me. I come here once a week or every other week as I'm a part of their annual membership. The staff is extremely knowledgable and I really find them to be trustworthy, which I'm really cautious about (being a girl at any auto company, naturally.)  And if you make a decision against something they suggest, they don't get an attitude like most places would, nor do they try to push you. The waiting area is always clean and consists of high tops, snacks, and tv's. Plus side: the bathroom is super nice and really clean! You can tell this place has been newly redone. I like that they suggest you can go shopping if you'd like while your car gets washed, which makes it easy for me to pop into Target and knock some items off of my list instead of waiting; so it's really convenient. All in all, friendly and knowledgable staff, clean and new amenities, and convenient.

I needed a manicure last minute with a girlfriend and we chose to check out Express Nails. I can say with absolute certainty I will most definitely be returning!  My nail tech was very attentive, and paid extra attention to not missing a single cuticle - usually this is rushed through in my experience. Great customer service all throughout and one of the best gel manicures I've gotten in Scottsdale. I love it and I know it'll last me the full 2 weeks due to how well it was applied. Thanks, guys!!

I've discovered the best dental office in all of Phoenix. Never have I had a more thorough visit to the dentist. Dr. Carr actually spent time with me and explained things very clearly. Not only that but he's really personable and engaging. His staff is the icing on the cake! Beverly, the office manager came out to greet me and is incredibly sweet. Moro and Leah are fantastic! Super nice, thorough, professional and engaging as well. The technology in this office is advanced and I love how engaged you can be with them and the social media outlets they utilize. Overall, you can tell this office cares for their patients and wants to create a friendly and "family-like" atmosphere to maintain that forever patient which I'm sure they have a lot of. Will be recommending this practice to everyone! Thanks guys!

I have gone here 3 times, been the only person in the store and have been rudely ignored each and every time. Totally turns me off to buying anything. I went in today and both girls were in the corner standing in front of the mirror checking themselves out and looking at their split ends and talking about their hair. They looked right at me and didn't even acknowledge me or smile. I noticed two other customers walked in and nothing. The only time they acknowledged me was when I walked to the cash wrap. I don't know who manages this store but it needs a major overhaul of its employment staff. If they reviewed their cameras they'd see how inattentive and lazy these associates are. I'm sure their sales would go up as a result of hiring friendlier and more customer-focused staff. Continuously I have terrible service from a Spanish girl with a very strong, possibly South American accent.. I hope this matter is taken seriously since these individuals represent the brand in a very bad light. Will be writing to corporate!

Zizzo does the best work in the valley, and I wouldn't trust my clothes to anyone but these guys. Amazing customer service, fast work, and great prices. Phil is also extremely hilarious and I look forward to coming here each and every time.

I love Tony's! I took a couple of pairs of work heels in to get fixed as an alternative to buying entirely new shoes and they look brand new again! Not to mention they were done the very same day and you really can't beat the price. Thank you Tony!

I was iffy before coming in because I was really wanting a back massage, but I received the best back massage in 15 minutes than I ever have had in a 60 minute session. And talk about the foot massage!!! Holy cow. I loved my session and I wanted to continue right after it ended. I WILL be going back here!!

Gary was the best waiter I've had in years!!! So entertaining, funny, and really sold all the entrees to us. If you own a restaurant, you'd want all servers to be like him. I came one other time and my server was not entertaining or all that attentive.... Kind of dull.   The food here is great although their menu is a little small. Definitely a little too dark in some spots too.. I remember us sitting in almost total darkness. All in all it's a great date spot or good for happy hour after work.

So I've been coming to Teres for about a year now, and I usually book with whoever is available since I have found every tech to be great here. Today that changed today when I went in for a last minute gel manicure with their new tech Yvonne. She is AMAZING. Yvonne has this great, positive energy and her passion for this industry is easily visible and voiced. I found her to not only be talented, but inspiring, sweet, and genuinely curious about me. She quickly established a bond with me in the same way you develop one with your hair stylist you never change. After my appointment I changed my scheduled pedicure for the next day to a date two days later just to have it with Yvonne. She'll be worth the wait!

Loved this place! It's filled with amazing, old books - great for decorating but also for collecting. I bought a book that had an inscribed note dated back to 1906!  The owner truly is passionate about vintage finds. She also has great tips and is funny. Cool place to check out and see what you end up with :-)

Two words: KERRY MITCHELL! I'm literally sitting in the parking lot after my hair appointment shamelessly taking selfies because of how amazing my hair turned out. I moved to AZ a year ago and have been on the hunt for a fabulous hair dresser... well, my search is over. Forever a client. Thank you Kerry!

Love the customer service here. The people who run this are really gracious and genuine. I don't feel like they're pushy like other nail salons in the area. They have a rewards program app. that can be used at any location (they're expanding rapidly) so that's plus for someone who gets their nails done often. I also enjoy the fact that their products don't have that toxic, chemical smell and it has a relaxing spa feel to it. Wish they would have something on the tv other than the news, though... I want to relax, not feel like I'm at a doctor's office.  Herbal nails is located in a very busy plaza (with Sumo Maya & Vivo!) but they do have complimentary valet parking. All in all, a good place to get a mani and pedi.

I love my Hair by Maggie! I've been waiting for her to get a Yelp page so I could brag about my hair. ;) Maggie is extremely passionate about hair, unlike stylists I've been to in the past who just go through the motions. She's the only hair stylist I've ever said, "I trust you, just to go for it" and I felt totally confident it would turn out amazing. And it does. I get complimented on my hair color all the time and I love how natural it looks. Thanks Maggie!!

I have been going to AZ PowerTrain for a month now and love it! This place has everything going for them!  Facilities - The women's locker room/showers are spacious and clean. They provide more than enough room to shower and get ready after a class. There are plenty of lockers if you choose not to leave your items in their cubbies (which they have tons of!) This is great as I've been to studios where I've had anxiety over there being space to store any of my belongings and cringing at the thought of using their showers. This is not the case at AZ PowerTrain!   Their studio sizes are very large and provide plenty of space to accommodate a large number of students. I've been to classes at other studios where I feel like I'm on top of the other students and it consciously disrupts my practice. I don't have to worry about being the last one entering class and having to succumb to the last few feet of floor space in the corner.   Now I've only taken Warm Vinyasa, Hot Powerflow, Set 26, and Barefoot Bootcamp - so I can say in regards to these classes that they are awesome! What makes the difference for me are the instructors at AZ PowerTrain. Every single instructor I have taken here is genuinely nice, helpful and caring. Whoever had a decision in bringing on these instructors I applaud you.  Jen is my absolute favorite- I love that we focus on something specific for each class (arm balances, backbends, etc.) and she's very spiritual- her classes are therapeutic and a great workout! Adam is hilarious - if you need a good laugh and a great workout, take any class he is teaching! He's very informative and I've never taken class where he hasn't made it fun.   In addition to great instructors, the front desk staff is great, too. Always greeting you and acknowledging you when you leave, as well. They set a positive vibe for your first and last impression while you're there.   Outside of yoga, I took the Barefoot Bootcamp class with Destiney and it was AWESOME! I loved the variety and how tough it was. If I took this class every day I'd have a killer physique. I've also heard from lots of students that the TRX classes are awesome and a must. It's still on my list to try here (I love the variety of classes) I just need to take advantage!  I know this is out of AZ PowerTrain's control but I will also add that everyone in class is extremely nice too. I've been to studios where the crowd is very pretentious and cliquey and I truly have never felt that way about anyone else here. (Something I worried about being in North Scottsdale at such a nice studio.) The vibe here overall is just great!   I plan to continue coming to AZ PowerTrain and can't say enough great things! Try the first 2 weeks for free deal and you'll be hooked! See you in class!
