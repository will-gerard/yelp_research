Great selection of girls! Good vibe, average prices for drinks, friendly girls, and all around better than any Scottsdale strip club I've ever been too ( Skin, Babes, Hi-lighter) The only thing keeping it from a 5 is one girl who turned down a fast $100 to dance in the back for 4 songs- rather she stayed to dance for $10 lap dances for one sleazy guy. Maybe he promised her a diamond ring??!

I am happy with the customer service....BUT .....The two star rating is a result of  - the deceiving arrangement presented in the online picture, the lifeless look of the flowers, AND the $ price you pay for such a puny cube. The dimensions are posted, but unless you are reading the fine print, you would expect so much more for the $70 you are paying. I suggest going to AJ's where at least you are paying for what you get. I suppose you would only use Cactus flower for the convenience of their delivery service. Cactus Flower should be embarrassed for the product they are delivering. I am definitely not calling CF again.

Great drinks, great view. Disappointing service all around. What's with the patio servers and the non-existent bar-tender? Can not believe that a place like this does not welcome you when you sit down, offer you drinks and service the second you walk in.

Amazing. That is all you need to know. Make sure you try the sopa de chile marron'. Phenomenal. Great service here, the bonus.

This Dominos location has never disappointed us.  The freshness and quality of their pizza is always spot on- not to mention their customer service.  They are always quick to deliver and friendly at the door!

This place is a rare find in the heart of Scottsdale. If you love delicious Indian, great service, lively ambiance, then you'll fall in love with TD just as I have! My favorite dishes are the Chicken Tikka Marsala, Lamb Vindaloo, Paneer Makhani, and their garlic naan (the best naan I've ever tasted). If you enjoy super spicy, make sure you request the chef's spicy! You may be disappointed if you don't request extra spicy.   Every Friday and Saturday the exotic spicy cuisine is paired with its spicy, exotic belly dancers. I highly recommend checking this hidden gem out.

Indian Spice, previously known as Taj Mahal, can not compete with any other Indian restaurant in the Valley. I drafted a review for Tandorii Times about a year ago and was dead sure IT was the best. .... But Indian Spice has me hooked. I will definitely be back for the Chicken Tikka Masala, garlic naan, samosas, and the Paneer- to die for. If you like spicy- make sure you ask for way more than an 8 on the 1-10 scale. Our dishes were low medium at an 8.

Great food, great ambiance. Huge selection of roasted coffees and juices. I recommend the Jolt - frozen espresso goodness. The service is always up to speed and friendly.
