The food was delicious and moderately priced. Everything we had was great. Staff was very friendly. We will definitely be back again.

I left my car keys in the back of an Uber and the company nor the driver will respond to my messages. Making a replacement key is very expensive. On top of that she dropped us off 2 blocks away from our destination because she didn't want to wait in traffic. This is the second bad experience I've had with Uber. They do not train their drivers well. I feel they take anyone off the street to drive for them. I can't understand why the driver would not respond so I could get my keys back, it makes no sense. A lot of unnecessary stress and money.
