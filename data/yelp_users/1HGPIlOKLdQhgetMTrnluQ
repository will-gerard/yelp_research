There is nothing that I don't love about this place.  My first visit was a late afternoon lunch after a hike and we sat on the patio.  Trust me when I tell you that you MUST get the bruschetta.  I can't wait to go back.  The parking doesn't bother me a bit because it's all part of the experience-don't let it deter you.  If you want a big lot and a restaurant with crappy food, no ambiance, and terrible service, go to Chili's.

We love everything about this place.  We can't believe we didn't discover it sooner.  Thanks to Nick and the crew for always taking care of us and our kids!  If you want great food and love to support local, this place is perfect for you!  Get the Super Six if you're not on the wagon.  Oh and start with the mozzarella cheese bread.  The gluten-free Greek pizza is awesome if you roll like that.  And go on Thursdays.  Trust me.  Half price pitchers.  Enough said.

Best brunch.  Best service.  Best food.  Our 4th year in a row for Mother's Day Brunch and another epic menu.  We totally appreciate the red carpet treatment on special days, and really, ALL days.  The place is just dope.

Had been waiting to try this place-heard nothing but greatness.  Went for a quick lunch before a work event and it was PACKED on a Thursday.  I got an already-ready salad because I was in a hurry and it was FAB.  My co-workers both got sandwiches and said they didn't disappoint.  I love the atmosphere and can't wait to go back for brunch and when I have more time to enjoy it!

Went for happy hour on a Friday based on the recommendation of a friend.  Got there early enough to get a table and beat the dinner crowd.  Prices were awesome and the service was great.  Food and drink great.  The only thing that kept it from 5-stars was the parking, noise level, and size of the inside.

4 stars for the food, ambience, and brunch. The service is always less than stellar.  Went today for brunch and had the worst service yet. Waited 15 minutes for acknowledgment by the waitress.  After another 15 minutes we got our food but still had no drinks.  Cancelled our bloody mary carafe but got charged for it anyway.  Got our mimosa carafe 5 minutes later-it should have been free but of course was not.  We never received so much as an apology from the waitress-the host ended up being more polite and taking better care of us. It's disappointing that we keep having such poor service because the food is so damn good.....Many of my friends have had similar experiences-not sure what it will take to see the service improve.

Update from previous review-Tom (the owner) contacted me and we exchanged a few emails about my experience, how hard it is to manage and develop staff, etc.  He was apologetic and we have a carafe on the house the next time we visit.  I think it's great that Tom contacted me, and other Yelpers, to make things right.  Thanks Tom!

Best happy hour in the area.  Wish the Desert Ridge location would lighten up on the staff and let them be-the vibe in Tempe is much more mellow.  Things to try:  Black Bean Burger and the Spinach pasta salad-must add chicken.  We always customize our app, by getting 1/2 red pepper hummus (ridiculously delish) and 1/2 tzaziki with a side of cucumbers.  This one is VERY kid-friendly and has the best service around.  We go once a week!

Stopped in today after reading Yelp reviews.  Happy hour is only in the bar-that alone means we likely won't be back.  HATE restaurants that do that.  We always have our kids with us and like to enjoy a HH beer while out.  Waitress seemed annoyed to be at work, and the place was EMPTY.  Pizza was good and the housemade mozzarella was amazing.  Place was expensive too-$78 before tip!  If I ever patronized them again it would be for takeout.

Elaine took our family photos in the fall of 2011.  I was impressed with how she assessed our venue and with all of the fabulously creative shots she planned to take.  The pictures came out great!  In addition, she was great with my kids and very patient-taking pictures with a 7 and 3 year old can't be easy.  We'll be calling on her again this year for another round of shots for sure!

The food is just okay.  I think having servers, a hostess, and a bar is an excuse to charge more.  YC's is a simpler set-up, it's cheaper, and you get more food.  Enough said.

Maybe 2 1/2 stars.  The food is not warm but tastes okay.  There is a great selection.  The sushi had been sitting out for awhile so I bypassed it.  The staff all seem to not know what is going on, but that might just be because it's new.  Kid-friendly so I'm sure the hubs will make us come back, unfortunately.

Oh man, where do I start?  Finally hit this place up yesterday for brunch with a girlfriend and our sons.  Convinced the friend I was meeting today for brunch to go there instead of Postino!  The menu is fantastic.  We tried the prosciutto and asparagus flatbread and the pumpkin pancakes yesterday, and shared.  You get HUGE servings.  We had the prosciutto omelette today with a side of pumpkin pancakes because they were so good yesterday I had to have them again, and we shared again.  The kids tried the chocolate chip pancakes and were thrilled.  Couple suggestions:  -Don't sit at the bar unless you are in a hurry.  The service was WAY better in the restaurant.  Not thrilled with our service today at the bar. -The strawberry mimosas are great but only when stirred.  Ask for a straw and stir it up before you take a sip.  YUM. -Yes, it's loud, but that's part of the awesomeness.  It's super kid friendly and also adult brunch friendly.  Something for everyone.  Baby crying? That's okay!  Arguing with the husband?  That's okay!  This place will drown it out and you'll be so happy with your full belly and amazing food when you leave that you'll forget your woes. -Do NOT go there for the first time and not order the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes.  They are light, fluffy, and have a tad bit of salt so they are not as heavy and sweet as you would think a dish like this would be.  I can see why they are the signature.  WOW. -Their hash browns are off the chain.  Go with a friend, order any omelette (which comes with hash browns) and get the pumpkin pancakes.  They split it for you with no upcharge and it's enough food for 4 people. -Chocolate covered bacon.  Order it.  No questions.  Need I say more?  It's chocolate covered bacon!  This is our new brunch spot.  We've been loyal Four Peaks brunchers for years.  Glad to have a new spot to break things up a bit.

They source local whenever possible.  Everything is crazy fresh.  Super filling even though they mostly cater to the salad crowd-get the 'big' salad for only a slight caloric increase.  Ask them to do 'light' dressing to keep the caloric content down too if you roll like that-the salads have so many yummy ingredients you don't need heavy dressing.  This is a quick stop-not a sit down and be served kinda place.  GREAT for weekday lunches. Have been twice and this is going to be a new regular stop for me.  Plan on getting something new every time because the menu has so many amazing things I want to try them all.

Mom and pop shop.  Awesome menu and service.  Order the fried pickles with ranch-trust us!  We are so excited that they have a breakfast menu and we can't wait to come back to test it out and have a mimosa.  It is kid friendly and their happy hour cannot be beat in this area.  We are not whiskey people but if you are, this will be your fave spot.  A must visit folks.
