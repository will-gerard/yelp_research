Seriously the best nail place I have ever been! Everyone in there is so friendly and they do an amazing job! I have been coming here for the past 2-3 months and they have yet to let me down!  A lot of nail places are the same but not voila! It's a small more personal experience. Recommend 100^

The manager was so rude- she was an older lady, tall, gray hair.. Never asked if she could help us and then we we Asked for help to look at rugs she said sarcastically "oh yay" cause she had to Move stuff in order for us to get to them and then she just walked away and left... She just missed out on a sale. I would never go back there.
