Love hertz! With most of the reviews and experiences it is hit or miss. When you travel and plan your trip you expect all reservations and experiences to go along as planned. All of my trips through this airport for renting a car have been as expected. You get off the bus, take the escalator to the Hertz level, see your name of the board and walk to your car and leave.  It's pretty easy... What I really liked was the bus driver gave us the address to the car rental return center and address to the closest gas station. This is always the issue when you return the car as its so expensive if you do not too the fuel tank off. What I did not like was the long bus ride to the car rental center...prepare at least 15 to 20 minutes for waiting and the bus ride. It is what it is so be patient and enjoy the beautiful weather in Phoenix.

When you are out of town and in Scottsdale Stingray Sushi is one of my go to places to eat. It is a great place to meet friends and have an awesome lunch or dinner. Stingray Sushi has this very hip vibe going on when you first walk in and it can be a bit overwhelming but once you are seated the service is great. They bring you warm wash cloths to prepare for your meal. We ordered a few rolls but the Mango Tango and Lava Rolls were my favorite.  The service was good but when all the hostesses and waiters are very young they tend to socialize with each other and get caught up in drama that is going on between them so for this reason I gave them 4 stars.  I will say that I plan on eating at Stingray Sushi again once I am back in Scottsdale, it's good eats.

OK, everyone raves about these cupcakes, but I do not get it! For one the price is crazy expensive and the cupcake itself was OK. I tried the red velvet my favorite cupcake and the frosting was tasty without being too sweet, but the cake was dry and fell apart when you try to take the wrapper off. Not going back.

Ok I am a fan of American Airlines.  What are your choices out there for airlines? They are the best of the worst in my opinion. Also, call it ego and the need to have status; I like status. I finally made platinum this year and there are so many platinum's not it's not a big deal.  I like to board early to put my carryon items away and I like to be able to show and go stand by for an earlier flight without a charge... When you book, choose choice essential as if you need to change your flight times there will not be an extra charge or if you want to select your seat in advance you will not be charged. The new aircraft A319 that they have started flying are awesome. These planes are clean, have more cabin room and your own personal entertainment center although they do charge you for the premium channels.   Ok so blah, blah, blah complain all you want and yes we do have bad experiences from time to time but if I can have an uneventful flight and travel experience then I am good to go. Keep on flying.

Nice atmosphere, dark and intimate with a great jazz band playing. Seated at the bar by myself taking it all in, relaxing with my vodka cranberry with a lime...here on business wishing I had gotten here earlier as this outside shopping center is the BOMB!!! Eddie V's offers valet parking for $5.00, it's worth just pay when you finish with your fine dining experience.  The bartenders are attentive as you would expect in a fine dining restaurant. I ordered the crab cake and it was awesome and comes with remoulade sauce. OMG, so much crab and it's a whole meal in its self. Your meal comes with a warm bread loaf.   If I lived here, yes I do believe I would be a regular here. Classy, relaxing a bit noisy but nice place and worth the money.

Mexican food, I think they impersonate Mexican food. Service was bad, food was greasy and a waste of money. Pay attention to the reviews and skip this place, go somewhere else. I sat down for a quick bite and was virtually ignored for about 10 minutes but finally placed my order. The food took 15 minutes and when it arrived it was cold. Pass on Jackalope Flats.

Love this Marriott. This is my 4th visit to the Courtyard Marriott Salt River. The hotel itself has a modern vibe and is located in a quiet area of Scottsdale off of Pima road. The staff is friendly an always greets you upon arrival. The beds are comfy and the rooms are spacious.  I am only a Gold member so no free breakfast here but the do have a deli type restaurant which offers some nice menu items. The oatmeal is a big hit with me. Try this place out, you will enjoy.
