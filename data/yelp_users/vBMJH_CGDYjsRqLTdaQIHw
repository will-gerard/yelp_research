**Original review from 6/1/2011. Updating new profile.**  I've been coming to this place, and particularly this location, for years. Their menu is vast and I just love the selection. 99% of the time I'm in here for breakfast. Since I'm a pescaterian (and I eat poultry), I'm limited to what I order from the menu, but I've never had a bad plate. I love the nurse's bialy, the castroville omelette, the cloud 9, the crabby one and many more. I've been here once for lunch and their sandwiches are fantastic!   Every time I've modified my order, they have never said they couldn't do it. They are always accommodating. Their service is great and always friendly. Food comes out hot, delicious and I've never turned down a plate due to a wrong order or something not cooked properly.  Keeping them from getting the coveted 5 star rating is their refusal to budge on charging me extra on the fruit bowl.  I'm allergic to melon and they charge me extra to modify the fruit bowl.... really?  Also, their coffee is less than desirable. Their flavored coffee is watery. But I don't come here for the coffee and they don't claim to specialize in it. On a few occasions, I've been served dirty glasses and flatware.

**Original review from 5/8/2011. Updating new profile.**  I live in the East Valley, so this place is not exactly convenient. I go there when I have the chance after visiting family on the west side. Tonight, I took my mother for the first time. She is in love with the place.  It's a small little cafe with a limited menu. However, this menu is perfect for the place. It's simple and delicious. Their zeljanica (spinach pastry similar to spanakopita) is damn near perfect. I've had their pileci (chicken sandwich) and it's so tender, juicy and friggin' addictive. My mother loved this so much she ordered an extra one to go so she could take it to work the next day. I have a feeling my gas budget is going to go up so I can take my mother here more often. It's quite a drive from East Mesa!  I ordered their Bosnian/Turkish coffee today for the first time. I loved it. Great flavor and my only complaint was that it was too late in the day to have another!   For my Muslim friends, I've asked if their meat is halal and sure enough, it is! I definitely recommend this place.  Their service and their food is excellent. The only reason why it didn't receive 5 stars from me was the fact that it's a little dirty there and the resident Bosnians of the place were making my son a little uneasy because they were staring at us a lot. My opinion? Who cares!!! I didn't go there to see if people were going to stare at me or not. I went there to experience food you do not normally find in the US, or particularly, AZ.

**Original review from 6/2/2011. Updating new profile.**  I went to visit a friend up in N Scottsdale and we decided to try this place with our families. I had no expectations going in. I was just hungry.  We were seated almost immediately. There were 7 of us, so prepping a table was in order. Immediately we were introduced to our waiter and drink orders taken.   They served the complimentary chips and salsa. I could have satisfied my hunger with that. The chips (and those who know me well, know I am not a chip person, nor a salt person.) were not salty, not oily, and the salsa was so delicious!! It had a great roasted flavor and just enough heat to satisfy me, but not spoil my taste for my dinner. Yum....  I ordered the seafood enchiladas. My friend ordered the chorizo stuffed chicken. Once my friend to her first bite, she was hooked. I actually heard a groan of satisfaction escape her. That says a lot considering she ran her own restaurant and is pickier than I am with my food. My seafood enchiladas were delicious! The seafood wasn't rubbery and overcooked. The salmon inside was tender and perfectly cooked. They didn't tell me what the catch of the day was though. I didn't care. It was GOOD. The side dishes were good too. I was happy to hear that the pinto beans were cooked with a chicken stock and not pork products. Whew!  Since this was my first trip, I am hoping that they are consistent. I want to go back.

**Original review from 5/20/2011. Updating new profile.**  Mmmmmm I love this place. I've been coming here on a regular basis since 2007. Found this place because I was mad at my boss and was driving around and pulled in to try Essence Bakery and was distracted by the fact there was an Ethiopian restaurant in the same plaza. So I decided to try this place instead. So, so, so glad I did.  (Regarding my first time) I walked in and immediately fell in love with aroma of the place. It was definitely tickling my senses. I ordered the doro wat (chicken) w/the traditional egg, misr wat (red lentils) and the fosolia (green beans and carrots in a tomato sauce). This was served with injera (looks like a crepe and tastes like a heavenly sourdough bread). To drink, I ordered the Yekmen tea, cold. Wow, talk about a drink to complement your food. This tea is fantastic.  The food is very flavorful. The spices are well balanced. Their version of spicy/heat is pretty mild for my taste, but everyone has their opinions of this. I highly recommend getting the Yekemen/Yekmen chai, hot or cold, with your order. The spices in the tea complement the spices used in the food very well. This is coming from someone who always order water with her meals. This is probably the only place I order tea instead of water.  I've heard some people complain about the service. Well, guess what, in Ethiopian culture, they are very laid back. This place does check on you, sometimes slowly. I'm grateful for that. Understanding the culture, I don't complain about the service. I do recommend that if you are in a hurry, place your order to-go.  Here's the one downfall. Their food is a little on the oily side. Wat is a type of thick stew and most of the wat recipes call for kibae, a type of spiced butter. I thought at first that the oily part was going to be a problem for me, but after dining at Blue Nile, I discarded the notion. Blue Nile had almost none of this oil, but then again, they lack the flavor too. That's another review for later though. I'll take the flavor any day!  I've since brought my mother, son, sister, friends, co-workers, clients and anyone I can think of. Their reactions are always: surprise that they like Ethiopian food and that they want to come back for more.

**Original review from 5/5/2011. Updating new profile.**  I used to go here a lot. The owners still know my name when I pop in on the occasional shopping visit, which I love.   I am in love with their chicken shwarma and chicken kabobs.  I don't eat red meat, so I cannot comment on their beef dishes, but my son LOVES them. I always order their Arabic coffee.  It's not Turkish, as some people have written.  Turkish coffee is made with a different spice, but the technique is the same. Either way, I love the Arabic coffee here.  I would give them five stars, but their hummus can be too salty at times. Maybe they are using canned hummus, don't know and I hope they don't.  Also their tabouleh usually is dripping with lemon and that's too much for me. The bulgur should soak up just enough to flavor and still be dry.   Here you will also find a great, but quaint, grocery store. Their pricing is awesome and I love the selections of spices, herbs and teas. Their feta is fresh and priced so well that I refuse to buy it anywhere else. They also offer various kitchen items that are priced very reasonably as well.  I've bought my tea and coffee sets from there and my cutting boards. They have a good, not huge, but decent selection of shisha also. This is my one-stop-shop for my Middle Eastern groceries.

**Original review from 5/3/2011. Updating new profile.**  If you ever go to Vegas, this place should be on your list of places to dine. I've been here every time I visit Vegas and I've never been disappointed. My brother's wedding reception was also here and they still had stellar service. They are just south of the airport on Las Vegas Blvd, maybe 10 minutes from the strip if you hit traffic.  You sit down and before the second butt-cheek hits the chair, your bread is on the table. Very soon after that your water. I've had several different entrees there and every single one of them have been great! I love their breakfasts too.... especially at 2pm. LOL Their service is exceptional. Their food is always wonderful and I've managed to hook my family on this place too.  I was particularly impressed when they hosted my brother's wedding reception. Even though there was a selection of pre-determined items to choose from, because I'm vegetarian and not a fan of alfredo (thanks to my meat eating brother, this was the only veggie meal in his selection), they had no problem offering me something else and offering it to other people as a selection as well. I loved this. The only complaint I had, as my brother's photographer, was that the lighting was so dim, the pictures were hard to take.  The only thing I haven't had here is dessert. I'm going to have to change that.

One of the few places outside of my house that you can get good food and hookah in one setting. They offer a buffet (which I have never tried), hookah, dine-in, take out, a small deli, a hookah shop to get your personal supplies and outdoor seating with misters for summertime comfort (if you can get that in Phoenix!). They also have a hookah lounge that is open later than the restaurant upstairs.  I am a regular customer and Olga, Mike and Ronda are always very nice and helpful. Since I cook Middle Eastern food at home, I tend to pay extra attention to restaurants offering similar foods. Their hummus, babaghanoush and falafel are ok. I can eat the hummus and not complain or turn it away, but my friends keep telling me that it is not as good as mine. The falafel (when I had it) was bland, but cooked perfectly. I like the falafel at Haji Baba's better.  Their chicken shwarma has always been stellar. I love it. My friends love the gyro meat there. I've never had over-cooked or under-cooked meat here. The flavors make your taste buds cheer. Their Turkish coffee is always delicious and made to my taste.  I have a new favorite recently: Fattoush with chicken. Yummmmm. A little heavy on the dressing usually, but still yummy.  Their hookah service is usually wonderful. Coals are always refreshed, but I noticed if a customer isn't quite familiar with hookah maintenance, they don't turn the coals for them.  Sometimes, the service is slow there, but since I know it isn't the case on a regular basis, I let it slide. There hasn't been anything that screamed "Don't come back here!" and I find myself meeting friends there all the time. Great hangout and chill place.

**Original review from 5/5/2011. Updating new profile.**  Another place I must visit when I'm out in Vegas. Of course, I've only been here 3 times and each time I get the same thing. Lump Crab Eggs Benedict. Heaven in my mouth! I don't come here for the coffee, which is drinkable, but not the best. I come here for this heavenly lump crab dish.... and the deli/bakery items. My mom had me try the potato cakes last time we were there and..... excuse me. Had to take a breather. Just thinking about those delicious, wonderful potato concoctions with the apple sauce.... Yummmmmmmmm.  The cafe service has been great for me each time. The last time I was there was on a Sunday morning and they were jam packed!!! The waitress was great and attentive, even though the place was packed. On busy days, I understand poaching eggs can be a little difficult because there's a lot more to pay attention to, so when I pointed out that my eggs had been overcooked, without hesitation, she comped me for one of my favorite things in the bakery. (I didn't want them remade.... they were still edible)  The bakery staff is why this place didn't receive a 5 star rating from me. Since I'm still new to the place, I didn't know that you had to stand in line at the deli to get service at the bakery. No one spoke up and when I tried to get the attention of one of the guys, I was blown off. When I finally received service, I placed my order and then asked for something from the deli. He treated my request as a big inconvenience. Needless to say, if it's a busy day, I'll just eat at the cafe and leave my bakery/deli order for another, less busy time.  Their food is great. Their bakery and deli items are delicious. I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone, but I would tell them to be patient and try to go when it's not so busy.

**Original review from 5/3/2011. Updating new profile.**  After trying the one in Gilbert several years ago, I was afraid to try this location. But I was hungry from fasting for a blood test and decided to try this location. I won't be going back.  For the record, this is not the same owner as the one in Gilbert (as I found out), and the food was much better than the one in Gilbert. I ordered a chicken shwarma plate with a side of hummus - to go. Instead of warning me that there's no lunch plate available for shwarma, only pita wraps, I was charged for a full priced dinner.  Nice.  Thanks.  The "dinner" comes with rice topped with a tomato sauce, salad or lentil soup and the shwarma. The shwarma had a great flavor, but was a little dry for my liking. The rice was overwatered, meaning it was mushy and they used too much water when cooking it. The tomato sauce they used to top the rice was good. What shocked me was that they put a small salad in the corner of my to-go box and the lettuce was covered with the warm rice and chicken. Gross. Soggy, warm lettuce. Ew. I cannot comment on the side salad I received because I forgot to tell him that I don't like creamy dressings and it was smothered in it.  My fault for not telling him.  They don't make their hummus fresh. Their hummus has the consistency and taste of the canned hummus you can buy at Haji Baba's down the street. It was over salted (canning process!) and they used too much oil for the consistency. I threw away my lunch half way through. I can get better food elsewhere.  If you are not familiar with Middle Eastern cooking, you will find this place good and charming. If you are familiar, I'm sure you know to steer clear of this place.

I think this place needs a dance floor. It is in a nice area, nice shopping center, and it is a very nice looking restaurant. You would think the atmosphere would cater to the typical patron for the neighborhood. However, I felt like I should have been ready for a night out at the club. The music is loud, thumping and just not what I want to hear when trying to enjoy my meal. I have only been to this location 3 times in the last 5 years because of this and the quality of the food.  The sushi is average, not great or noteworthy. I can eat it if someone really wants to dine here, but it is not my first choice. I haven't tried the sashimi, but to be honest, I won't if I think their sushi is mediocre. Most of the time it takes a while to get my sushi and it comes a little more towards room-temperature than I like. It should be chilled.  The service is average as well. You have to yell at your server because the music is loud. Last time I visited was a couple of weeks ago for a birthday. There was 7 of us. One of them ordered a California roll and it was the last thing served. By last thing, I mean the rest of us were almost halfway done with our meals by the time he received his roll. This should have been first out considering the basic prep for this roll.  I honestly don't know how this place stays in business. If you see the same complaints from a large number of (former) patrons, why not change the way you do business? If you have a slew of complaints about the music, turn it down! It's a restaurant, not a club. I don't dine here unless I am with someone who chose it and is adamant about it.

**Original review from 6/1/2011. Updating new profile.**  I'm not a red meat eater, but my best friend was in town and was craving a steak. I had no idea where to take her. Another friend suggested this place because it was close and she had only been here for drinks. We decided to be adventurous and give it a shot. The friend who suggested the place decided to meet us.  We were seated immediately and although I was a little disappointed that we were seated in the hallway, next to the kitchen door and across from two other tables that we had to face because our table was horseshoe shaped, the seats were far back enough that the kitchen door didn't bother me. I was still a little conscientious of the other two tables with people staring at us though. Strike one.... horrible table.  Get it out of there.  Strike one was redeemed with a fabulous waiter. He was attentive, and we never had empty glasses or plates once we ordered. We received bread, appetizers, salads, entrees and refills with no hitch.   I wasn't impressed with the appetizer, but it wasn't their fault. I just can't see myself ever having shrimp with cheese ever again. I thought it was weird when I ordered it, but was curious. Curiosity satisfied.  We received our salads and entrees and dug in. My friend's steak was cooked to her liking and loved her seafood with it. She said everything was what she was craving and expecting. Coming from her, that's a huge complement. My other friend was equally happy with her slab of meat.  My entree was the chicken oscar, which has shrimp and scallops on top in a Bearnaise sauce. Took one bite of the scallops and shrimp.... oh my. Yummmmm. Scallops were cooked perfectly. I love scallops that melt in your mouth. The vegetables were cooked perfectly. Still crispy, not over-cooked. Then I get to the chicken and this is where strike two happens. The chicken was so salty that I couldn't even finish the second bite. Luckily, I was full from the veggies, scallops and shrimp and mashed potatoes I ate. When the waiter asked if he could take my plate and I said yes, he asked if there was something wrong with the chicken. So, being honest, I told him. At this point, I'm full, fat, dumb and happy so I declined his offer to replace it with something else.   Then here's where they redeemed themselves on strike two. Even though I told him it was unnecessary, the manager came over and apologized to all three of us. He looked at me and said he comped my salad and entree and then offered all three of us desserts and coffees on the house. He explained the saltiness comes from the rub the cooks use and he's asked them before not to use so much. I barely heard this because I was still astounded that not only is my entire meal free, but now desserts for all three of us too? And coffee? Who am I to turn down free coffee???  Then the manager asked me something I love to hear: Do you have any allergies? WHY YES I DO! NUTS!  He explained that I should not get these certain desserts and offered me all the nut free options. I asked him if I could marry him. It's been too long since someone in a restaurant asked me this before I could say something.  I would go back for another dinner. I know how to modify my meal to my satisfaction now. I would also recommend this place to my friends and family.

Underwhelming is a good word for this place. I liked our sweet waitress, and the atmosphere is nice. I can cook better food in my kitchen though, and faster. Took nearly 30 minutes to get our appetizer out to us (on a Sunday afternoon). How long do you need to slice tomato and mozzarella and drizzle it with balsamic for a caprese? Took another 30 minutes to get the lunches out to us.  I'm not quite sure what kind of oil they use to cook the chicken, but the aftertaste was disgusting and it upset my stomach to (what seemed like) no end. Their bolognese sauce was boring. The chicken was dry and was too greasy to be "baked". Their steamed veggies were actually overcooked and soggy.  I didn't bother trying their desserts. Got out of there quick.

**Original review from 5/3/2011. Updating new profile.**  I cannot complain about the pricey menu because knowing it is in the Biltmore area, I would expect to pay these prices.  The wait/host staff were friendly. There were four of us there for two birthdays. I loved the modern look of the restaurant and was very happy with the service throughout the night. The duck frittes were ordered and enjoyed immensely! Being the only person at the table who liked spicy foods, I ordered the harissa couscous and was expecting a hot dish, but it was served cold. it's not specified on the menu how it's served, but I loved it anyways. It's Israeli couscous, so they are the bigger ones and the harissa was just spicy enough for it. I've had hotter harissa though. Would love to try it hot instead of cold though.  I ordered the lobster pot pie for my entree. Had I been at home, I would have secretly licked the plate. It was delicious! Generous chunks of lobster and the sauce was to die for.  My friends ordered, and I'm not kidding all three of them ordered the same thing, the scallops with lobster sauce. It's not on the menu like that, but they asked for the substitution of the lobster sauce. The waiter gave us no qualms over it and when it was served it was perfect. The scallops melted in your mouth. I can't wait to go back just to try the full plate instead of the bite I had to beg my friend for!  The desserts were amazing and even though they look small, they are perfectly portioned for a full belly..... Can't wait to bring my mother here and spoil her.

A friend took me here for gelato for the first time the other day. I've been looking for a good gelato place since I had my first gelato in Rome. This place is wonderful!! On a fluke, they had for the one night only my favorite flavor combination: Orange Chocolate. I could have bought a gallon of it. So delicious! Since then I've had their Red Velvet gelato and it is scrumptious. Their dulce de leche, Madagascar vanilla, and tiramisu flavors are yummy yummy in my tummy too. (Been back several times, in case you can't tell) My son is in love with their pistachio flavor.  The owners are wonderful and have a great sense of humor. I didn't realize I lived a 1/2 mile from them and I've been in the neighborhood for 5 years!  4 stars for now because I need to try their deli.... just another excuse to go in there and get some more gelato!

Well, that was an hour I'll never get back. Narrow aisles and seating so close you think that the people next to you are part of your group. The clear plastic seating is an eyesore and not properly cleaned, so it shows all the little smudges, spots, etc (and they are not very comfy). Our waitress was either new to waitressing, or too shy for the job. Come on, if my menu is in the way when you are trying to put my glass of water on the table, say excuse me. Don't push my menu into my chest with my water to make room. She also barely checked up on us. For a Monday afternoon and hardly anyone in the place, I expected a little better service.  The food was alright and edible. The rolls are anything but sushi. Almost everything has ingredients that requires cooking, which isn't sushi. What didn't require cooking, such as the rolls topped with salmon, came in at room temperature and wasn't very appetizing. My friend loved her dynamite roll though, and I admit, I liked it too. I ordered a roll that had tempura shrimp and the tempura coating was rubbery and stretchy, meaning it wasn't freshly cooked. So gross.  There's better sushi out there with much better atmospheres. Period.

O mio Dio!! My friends know I don't like pizza, so believe me when I say this place is phenomenal. (My friends are also probably sick of this word.)  I was introduced to this place while looking for a place to dine while working Phoenix Comicon this year. My friend wanted pizza and I was too tired to argue with him. I'm so grateful I didn't. We were seated immediately and the server was very friendly and attentive.  My friend introduced me to burrata. It was a little ball of heaven. It melted in your mouth and was creamy. It came with speck (prosciutto) and Rob said it was delectable and perfect. I don't eat pork, so I'll take his word for it.  Following this was the quattro formaggio pizza. Oh sweet baby Jesus.... I loved it.  Then came the tiramisu. The owner's wife makes it daily from scratch. I've had my share of "good" tiramisu desserts that people raved about, but I could never fathom ever eating a second time. Hers was amazing. It is rich and the lady fingers are perfectly soaked with just enough of the coffee liqueur. The marscapone is creamy, smooth and layered equally. This is the only place I will eat this dessert now. Just delicious and a dance for my taste buds!  Since then, I've brought my sister, niece, son, mother, co-workers and friends to this place. They all love it. I've tried their burrata pizza, their regina margherita pizza and also the bianca. All of these are fantastic!!  I was finally brave enough to try calamari when one of my friends ordered it. Both my friend and my mother are extremely picky about calamari since it can be quite rubbery when not cooked right. Their calamari came out perfect. Not one bit was bad and the garlic and Italian chilies are very good with it. We were stabbing each others' hands with forks to get at the garlic.  Here's one thing that I found to set them apart from other restaurants. When I ordered the burrata and speck the last few times I was there, the server remembered that I do not eat pork, so he substituted artichokes and tomatoes so I could enjoy the entire appetizer. They didn't up-charge for the substitution like most places would.  For those with a nut allergy - Their pesto is made with almonds. It is not on the menu, so if you don't ask, you won't know.

My first time here.... and I'm officially a pig. This was delicious food!! I had the chicken and cheese wrap that had the veggies in it with garlic sauce. I wish I had ordered two (remember, I said pig). It was tender and juicy and the bread is phenomenal! Momtaz!! I ordered spinach pies for later, but between my coworkers and my infinite love of spinach and desire to try more from this place, they are gone. So delectable. Their bread is something I could eat ALL DAY!  Keeping it from getting my 5-star rating is the salt. I had the hummus with their fresh bread. It was soooo salty and had tons of oil on top. You couldn't taste the tahini and barely the chickpeas. All you tasted was salt and garlic... not that I'm complaining about the garlic. Their spinach pies, although very good, were also on the salty side. I think their food would taste much better without all the salt. Let the spices do the talking!   I will be back though. Salt aside, their food is wonderful!
