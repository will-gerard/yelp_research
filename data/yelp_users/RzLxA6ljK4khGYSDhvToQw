Well I am not going to tell you it is the most fancy or fine dinning, But it is one of me and my friends favorite places in Arizona. The menu doesn't  change this is true but there has been three other buffet places in Casa Grande and out of them TWO has closed. One had a larger and fancier menu and it was right next door. It still went under. I grew up on this food and my friends and I will still drive 45 mins to get to the restaurant.

Ok I swear I tried to like this place first it took 25 min to get my three tacos and nachos then my nachos where soggy. The carne was dry and not flavorful, I then tried the fish Taco it tasted like cat food. I didn't eat a forth of my meal I lost my appetite.
