The enthusiastic Chef Payton Curry has taken over the Welcome Diner for now, offering his unique culinary creations to the public on a limited time basis. The self proclaimed "guerrilla gourmet" has an emphasis on using local, fresh ingredients, which he obtains at local farmers markets and direct from local farmers. He cooks up all types of cuisine, but he also caters to the vegetarian/vegan eating crowd.  My wife and I visited this past Tuesday and were treated to a scrumptious 6 course vegan meal tasting that we thoroughly enjoyed. If you're looking for some local, delicious, gourmet food whipped up by a chef who truly enjoys his craft (and makes it show in his food), a visit to Chef Payton Curry is a MUST!  Full review with photos at: http://wesnovack.com/gourmet-vegan-dining-with-paytoncurrys-local-vegetable-dishes/  HOURS (from paytoncurry.com )  We will open on every first Friday of each month and every SUNday, MONday, and TUESday 5pm-CL  You will also be able to book the inside 8 seats on Wednesday-Saturday and have Payton mess with your palette while he doesn't hold his tongue. Contact for more info..

Oregano's on Camelback is one of our favorite places to go for dinner & some beers. We always take out of town guests there.  The outdoor seating in particular is one of our favorite places to hang out, eat and drink. You can enjoy your food while relaxing in an oasis-like environment outside, enjoying the breeze, the sun or a sunset. Good music is always playing (jazz and other boppy tunes) and they have heaters over the tables outside for when it gets cold at night.  They have a decent beer and wine selection, including some good ones for beer connoisseurs. Pitchers of beer pricing is reasonable.  The food is fantastic. For appetizers, we really like the Guacatoni (quesadilla served with fresh guac) and the spicy ravioli's. Pizza lovers will love their selection of pie types and calzones. There's also a good variety of pastas and salads.  For us, it doesn't get much better then Oregano's. Yes, the place is usually crowded and you'll have to wait for a table. Yes, there are birds tweeting and hopping around outside, but we love the atmosphere and the food and drinks.

The food & beverages at Moto are awesome.  The service needs a little help, as they don't always check on you to see if you need another beer or a water refill. They might just need more staff.  I award 4 stars because I know I will be back for the beer and food. Awesome selection of craft brews on tap, only $3/glass during happy hour (3pm - 6:15pm). Cheap appetizers during happy hour too. Win!  Numerous veggie choices (that are actually GOOD).   The wonton nachos minus meat were awesome.  The tofu yakisoba was awesome.  The veggie rolls were awesome.  I wish this place was closer to my house.

Ice House Tavern is a dive bar with character.  Behind the bar is a large plexiglass wall with the Arcadia ice rink on the other side. The coolness of this is that you can sit at the bar and watch hockey or ice-skating while you drink. When we first arrived, there was a hockey game in mid-swing. There were multiple occurrences of goal shots gone wide, with a final destination of smacking against the back of the plexiglass bar wall near us. I found this to be highly entertaining, but it could definitely cause some people to get startled, so you might not want to sit directly at the bar if there is a hockey game on-going and you are easily spooked.  They've got darts, video games, plenty of seating and a good bottled beer selection. I wish they had a good micro-brew on tap, but alas, I settled for the bottle route. Thankfully, they've got some awesome bottled beers, like the 22 oz Arrogant Bastard Ale from Stone Brewery and Kiltlifter from Four Peaks.  Cool (literally) & unique dive bar. Check it out and then test your luck out on the ice.  P.S. The place can be a bit difficult to find if you don't know where it is. Drive to the left of Wal-mart and into the back alley area, passing Arcadia Ice Rink & then make a left. You'll see banners at the top of the end of the first building. That's the spot. Enter on the side.

Yay! I'm a fan.  I've used City Wide Pest control many times for spraying inside and outside my house to control the bug population at my home.  The technicians are always very professional, friendly and are willing to answer any questions you may have.  Unlike many other Pest control companies, City Wide does not require you to sign a contract or agree to a certain number of months of service. You can just ask them to set you up month to month and they'll give you a call each month to see if you would like a service scheduled.  Nothing but good experience with City Wide so far. I recommend them.

2 stars from the vegan perspective. Why? Because they don't have much of any vegan food.  1) The pizza sauce contains cheese 2) The marinara sauce contains cheese 3) Their margarine contains whey 4) Their pasta contains egg or milk  So PLEASE start offering a vegan entrée and some vegan marinara sauce SoNY! Maybe some whole wheat pasta too?  I would like to take this opportunity to complement and praise our amazing server Andrea. She is so awesome! She happily took the time to check on all of the items and dish ingredients for us to find out if they were vegan (or most often, not). Amazing customer service!  We wound up eating the following: Custom made passion bread with no garlic butter or cheese. We had it brushed with olive oil and added some oregano. We then made an olive oil + balsamic + oregano dip. A salad with their Italian dressing. A small pizza with no cheese, no sauce, veggies + pineapple & olive oil added as a base.  Their passion bread (made from pizza crust) is super delicious but it really sucked that we couldn't dip in some marinara.

Disclaimer: Vegetarian here.  Bamboo house is one of our favorite Chinese restaurants in North Phoenix. Other people think so too, as it is normally very busy, although the place is big with ample seating, so there is generally no waiting.  The egg drop soup is delicious. They will make it Vegetarian if requested (water base instead of meat broth). We just love that soup!  They also serve hot tea (Oolong?) to everyone, which is another big plus in our book.  The main courses are good, I enjoy the orange flavored tofu and some of their other veggie dishes as well. My girlfriend has tried some of the meat dishes and was happy with them. Dishes come served with either steamed or fried rice (which might be a dollar extra).  We really like this place and would recommend that you check it out.

Baja fresh is pretty freakin fresh.  I love their "no freezer, no MSG, no preservatives, no nuthin crappy" vibe, which they reinforce with signage plastered around the restaurant.  The food is delish. Lots of good options for meat-eaters & veggie-heads. They do it right with a delicious salsa bar that containis at least 5 different salsas, fresh limes and they've got a good selection of iced teas.

Oh what a sad fall from grace... My previous review of Baja Fresh was very favorable. This one, not so much.  The experience started off poorly when the cashier sneezed in his hand while we were ordering. He never went to wash his hands afterwards. Perhaps he wasn't handling food directly, but he's grabbing chip bags, trays and other items right next to your food. Thanks for spreading the germs, dude.  As a starter, at least we managed to enjoy the tortilla chips & their wide selection of salsas.  For the main course, we ordered some grilled veggie burritos enchilada style. When they arrived, we were highly disappointed. The enchilada sauce didn't taste that good and the burrito contents were mostly cold. What part of "Grilled veggie burrito" is supposed to have cold vegetables?  With a brand new Chipolte across the street, it looks like we won't be visiting Baja Fresh any more.

We stopped in at Spinato's the other day and had some thin crust pizza and a baked spaghetti calzone.  All the food was delicious, especially the baked spaghetti calzone, which was something unique. The pizza was a bit too greasy for us, but some people like it that way.  They also had a nice little outdoor patio area, but it was too windy at the time for us to sit there.  Plus, great beer on tap to boot! They carry New Belgium's Fat Tire and Four Peak's Kiltlifter on tap. Thank you!  They have a specific happy hour special for each day of the week, so check out their deals schedule before picking a night to dine there.  We will be back.

I'm giving Castles N Coasters 4 stars for their mini-golf.  Four separate courses, plenty of creative greens & hazards, lots of decorations, statues, structures, fountains, everything that makes up a good miniature golf course. Oh, and did I mention they have 4 different courses?  Once your done with some tiny golf, cool off with some video games, pinball or skeeball inside their gaming area.  The rides don't interest me, so this rating & review ignores their "amusement park" aspect completely.

Dr. Jordan S. Weiner, M.D. at Valley ENT is one of my favorite doctors that I've ever had the pleasure of being treated by. He is highly intelligent, friendly, sympathetic and displays all the attributes of a phenomenal doctor. He helped cure my chronic sinusitis condition through a combination of nasal surgery and nasal rinsing treatment. He'll take the time to thoroughly discuss everything with you in detail, along with answering all your questions. He doesn't rush you out the door like many other doctors do. I wish he could be my doctor for everything!

1 star from the vegan perspective, as they use whey (an animal protein) in most of their breads, including their white and wheat sub breads. Please drop the whey (and all other animal products) from your breads!

We've tried this place a couple of times and we were not impressed.  The restaurant was relatively empty when we visited, yet it still took the server a very long time to bring us our drinks or to do just about anything, including check on us.  We didn't like the bread at all, it has a biscuit-like texture and didn't taste good. They really need to switch it out for some good, warm Italian bread.  The main entree pastas and the salads we did enjoy. Good food.  The restaurant itself and the interior is very nice, with a charming decor and ambiance. Each table has its own candle and the bar area looks pretty cool. The wine and beer selection is good. We enjoyed a couple of glasses of some tasty Pinot Grigio from Italy during our visit.  Overall, the lackluster service will keep us away. Hopefully you'll have a better experience there if you try it out.  UPDATE: The owner contacted me about my review and said that they have changed the bread to a warm crusty Italian bread now and have increased staff to provide better service, although an increase in staff wouldn't have helped with the bad service that we experienced. She also mentioned that they are a small family owned restaurant and value each and every customer very much, which is nice to hear.

The employees are very friendly and accommodating and the food is delicious!  We love this place! The roasted beet & brussel sprout salad is so good that we find ourselves craving it routinely (sans cheese, obviously)!  They are very happy to answer my questions on ingredients, omit cheese & other items from predetermined dishes and even substitute extra items (like pine nuts) at no cost. Very vegan friendly establishment!  Other food that we enjoy there: The pizza crust bread (vegan), pasta primavera using either a garlic olive oil sauce or a marinara sauce, with pine nuts added.   If you're looking for some tasty Italian food and excellent service, check out Babbo.

Definitely one of my favorite grocery stores. Tons of vegetarian & vegan options. Lots of whole food based items. Lots of items focused on using healthy ingredients. They make lots of their own brand products, many of which are VERY good and delicious. We love their hummus.  The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is that I can't always find every single item that I need there, as Trader Joe's is a smaller grocery store than most. This applies to their produce section as well, as I can't find a certain vegetable or other item I'm looking for there occasionally. Wish the store was even bigger and offered even more so that I could do all of my shopping there.

This place gets 5 stars for their 8 sand volleyball courts, which are lit up at night until around 11pm (or later if you're playing with someone who works there).  Supposedly you have to pay a $2 entrance fee at the gate sometimes, but there was no one charging admission there tonight.  They also have baseball/softball, batting cages (pay per use), and a bar/lounge area.  Great place to play some volleyball at night during the hot Arizona summer.

The curious case of the disappearing review. I'm sure I've reviewed Fajita's before, but it seems to have vanished.  Fajita's has some spectacular lunch specials. I give them 5 full stars for their lunch, not so much for dinner (much more pricey), which some how I've determined equals out to 4 stars.  So, go there for lunch, munch on some tasty fajitas on the cheap. Being a vegetarian, I thoroughly enjoy the veggie fajitas for a mere $5. They make their own in house tortillas, which are unique and very good. They also include their tasty chips & salsa for every customer.  Awesome lunch spot.

The veggie fajita lunch special here rocks! It also comes with free chips & salsa (although their salsa has absolutely NO spiciness, hence the 4 stars).  For vegans, get the: veggie fajitas, no cheese substitute guacamole for the cheese & sour cream optional: a side of fresh jalapeno's (75 cents)  They tell me their tortillas are vegan, containing just flour, baking powder and one other non-animal ingredient (can't remember what they said).

Oh Amelio's, I remember you from years ago when we used to order pizza's from you almost every Tuesday night, to take advantage of your buy 1 get 1 free pizza special. I haven't had an Amelio's pie in years, so I decided to try them out again by ordering up a large extra cheese & some breadsticks.  The large cheese pizza tasted ok, but parts of the pizza had absolutely no crust on the end of the slices, it was like eating flatbread pizza with the crust chopped off. C'mon guys, no crust, rly?  The extra cheese also seemed to be concentrated on just 2 of the 8 slices of the pie, which was disappointing.   The breadsticks were tasty, but the sauces were way too small to accomodate all the breadsticks.   Amelio's, please make your pizzas better and quit skimping on the sauce sides.

As Kelly M. mentioned "They don't use any lard in any of their food or animal products in the rice." -  great for those of us who are vegan.  Last time I was there I ordered up a big plate of loaded nachos with beans, jalapenos, tomato, onions, black olives & guac. It was delish!

I'm very surprised by the prior low star reviews of Barro's.  Barro's makes some damn good deep dish pizza. With lots of cheese, tasty sauce and a satisfying crust.  Awesome lunch specials keep the place filled mid-day. You can get a slice & a drink, a slice, a drink & a salad, 2 slices & a drink or other combos, all for around $4.  Pretty tough to beat, especially since their pizza is super tasty. Another pro includes some good house-made dressings (including ranch).

Vegetarian here.  Luckily, Roberto's doesn't use any lard or animal products in its beans.  After reading the glowing reviews here on Yelp, I reluctantly tried out this spot for lunch. Reluctantly, because it's inside of a Shell gas station.  When I got inside, I was surprised to see that the Roberto's took up a big chuck of real estate inside the building, around one quarter to one third takes up the restaurant seating area. You can sit at a table or at a bar area with a view out the window.   I ordered a bean, cheese and potato burrito. It took them awhile to get my burrito ready, but it was piping hot (temperature) when it arrived. After letting it cool a bit and burning my mouth a few times, I wolfed it down. Their red salsa is also fantastic, loved the flavor, poured it on top of my burrito at every bite.  I would make this my new breakfast burrito spot too, but they don't open until 10AM on Sundays.

We get some custom vegan pizza from here every once in awhile and we dig it!  Our usual order is the veggie pizza, no cheese, plus banana peppers & pineapple. Their crust & sauce is vegan, making it a good option for us. It's quite tasty! We also normally add an order of crazy bread with no parmesan cheese.  Staff is normally friendly and professional. Food is made quick, even for made-from-scratch orders like ours.

Ahh yes, Sardella's and their $5 medium pizza special. The location near 19th Ave and Union is my Sardella's home base. We grab a cheapie medium cheese to go quite often (the price is not good for delivery).  The toppings, ingredients & cheese is much better than what you would find at those national chains.  For a small shop cooked, good medium pizza, you can't beat 5 bucks. Try their ranch dressing as well. It's made in house and is delish.

Meh, Oriental Express doesn't do it for me. Their vegetarian selection on the Chinese food menu is extremely limited and of that, they only have one dish with tofu.  I gave it another go recently for lunch, ordering up the 2 time mushroom with fried tofu. The tofu isn't breaded or particularly interesting, just cooked and then slathered in some dark sauce with mushrooms and a few other veggies. It's an okay dish and will work in a pinch of you like mushrooms.  The vegetable eggroll was just disappointing. Soggy exterior and not so great.  I will probably go back, just to try out there veggie "sushi" rolls, but I'll be going elsewhere for regular ol chino-american food.

As many previous Yelp reviews state, Captain Bill's is a great place to grab a sub on the cheap.  Vegetarians can opt for "The Veggie", which should probably be renamed "The Cheesie". It comes packed with 3 types of cheese, a variety of veggies (including avocado) and is best topped with their delish Italian dressing.  The inside of this eatery is plastered with stickers, photos, and other decor. Most of the stickers and signs are comedic in nature, so look around a read while you're there, you're sure to get a chuckle at some of their stuff.  Good subs cheap. Fun atmosphere. I dig it.

Updating for the vegan perspective: I asked the staff & owner if their bread contained any animal products. He had no idea, but he did try to call his bread supplier (Capistrano's bakery) to find out for me. Unfortunately, they couldn't tell him at the time, so I asked him for the phone number (480-968-0468).  I followed up with a phone call to the bakery another day and they informed me that they use whey (an animal protein) in all of their wheat & white breads. Their sourdough bread has no animal ingredients, so vegans eating a sandwich here should opt for the sourdough bread.  Recommendation to Capt-N Bill: Add a vegan sub option to your menu.

Golden Greek is a diamond in the rough and I find myself craving it often.  The place is one of my favorites, if not my top Greek restaurant in the valley.  All of the food is made from scratch and absolutely delicious. I think I've liked pretty much every single food item that I've tried there, the hummus & pitas, the greek salad, the spankopita, the pasta de greco. Love all of it.  The service can be slow at times, but the fantastic food is definitely worth the wait. Prices are low, so the meals are easy on your wallet. If you want some spectacular Greek food, this is the spot for you.

Mi Pueblo is good, fresh, tasty Mexican food in the Ghettro center vicinity.   Prices are reasonable and the food is good. Vegetarian options are also available.  Their salsa bar is on point. They've got everything from roasted habanero tomatillo salsa, to a standard tasty red salsa that you would expect from a Mexican joint. Eat as much chips & salsa as you'd like.  I like to sit outside on their patio, which includes misters that help cool the area down a bit during the hot summer months.  If you're looking for some quick, informal Mexican food without the bottom of the gutter bertos feel, check out Mi Pueblo.

I wouldn't eat here for other meals, just breakfast.  They've got some decent dishes and actually just added some new $5.99 breakfast plates. On my visit this past weekend, I ordered up their egg, cheese & jalapeno enchiladas, which come smothered in a tasty tomatillo green sauce. I also added a side of red skinned breakfast taters for 99c.  We like to order up their "hibiscus coolers" with our late morning breakfasts. Sparkling wine + cranberry juice. Try it out!  If you sign up for their "E club" you get a free breakfast coupon on email. It's a risk free way for you to try them out! http://www.mimiscafe.com/EClub.aspx

Stopped in to get a new tube after Tera popped hers on our last critical mass ride.  Guys in the shop are hella cool. Very friendly, willing to talk to you, answer questions, show you how to do stuff etc.  I only bought a couple of tubes and a tool set on this visit, but I'm sure I'll be back for other biking gear.  I also bought my bro a mountain bike here a couple years ago and that experience was also stellar. No complaints for this place.

Loved it! Unique Ecuadorian/Peruvian/South American food with good flavors, excellent presentation and a good variety.  The vegetarian plate comes with veggie flan doused with cheese sauce, grilled plantains, a mound of rice, lentils in a tasty sauce and a fried egg over easy, cooked oh so right.  For those of you who aren't in the know, mash down the rice mound, salt it up, then throw the fried egg on top. Chop it up and feast! I love me some fried eggs & rice and they make the ingredients perfect here.  If you're looking for some unique flavors & food combinations that are sure to impress, check this place out!

My Bro and I dropped into this bro spot (Santisi Bros) today for lunch. I've been here many times as it is right down the road from my neighborhood.  It's dark inside, so prepared to be blinded if you exit mid-day. TONS of TV's lining the walls, most tuned in to a sporting event. Good beer & drink selection and good food selection. Pizzas, pastas, salads, calzones, sandwiches and more.  Today I went with the eggplant parmesan sub and I really think it is the best damn one I have ever had. So damn tasty and perfect. Crisp bread with a soft inside, crispy eggplant slices, delish cheese. I don't think it can get any better. There pasta dishes are also HUGE, so be prepared. Santisi is a great neighborhood sports bar who happens to also make some damn good food. Recommended.

Meh, we weren't that impressed with our latest visit to Top Shelf. It's decent enough, but they don't have anything in particular that will keep me coming back for more or craving anything in particular from the place.  The side of guac we got was also kinda crappy. Seemed like it was old or had some other prob. Maybe they made it in the morning and it didn't hold that well till the time we ate dinner there.  On the positive side, no lard is injected or slathered on their refried beans, so the plethora of dishes that include beans are safe for vegetarian consumption.

If you're a beer lover, you'll love Papago Brewing company!  With approximately 30 beers on tap and hundreds more in their fridge wall, Papago has a beer for everyone. The tap beer selection is also rotated weekly, with new, special and seasonal brews making their appearance all the time.  The inside decor is also very cool, lots of wooden, log cabin-esque seating and decorations, with hundreds of different tap handles stored in the overhead wooden beams.  If you want to play a game of darts, they've also got you covered with 2 dartboards near the entrance.  Downsides to the place include that there is no "free" music playing nonstop. To get some good tunes, you'll have to pay up to the Juke box monster, which can be pricey (I paid $1 for one song last time). You'll also want to get some music going because the place can get very loud with people talking when the place is crowded.  The food is decent, we enjoy the beer bites and the pizzas. Downside is that food isn't served all night, so get your order in before the kitchen closes.  Overall, if you enjoy a wide selection of good beers and a casual place to hang out, definitely check out Papago brewing company with some friends.

We love the Improv. We go here all the time, most recently to see Jim Breuer (who was absolutely hilarious). If you haven't been to the Tempe Improv, then you might not be a fan of comedy.  Obviously, your experience will vary depending upon who the performing Comedian is and how funny he/she is, but for the most part, the Improv gets some pretty hilarious individuals passing through.  The venue itself is a relatively small "theater", which means that you won't be straining your eyes to see the performer no matter where you sit. As far as seat recommendations go, we always try to get a front row spot on the balcony, which provides a great view and a non-cramped seating arrangement (the table seating is cramped).  A few things keep me from giving the Improv 5 stars. 1) The 2 drink minimum is lame. 2) They don't serve their draft beer upstairs, which means that I can't order a Fat Tire and I have to downgrade to drinking Newcastle's, which I really don't like very much. 3) They are super agro about cameras & photos. Absolutely no photos are allowed. Even a grainy, blurry, camera phone snap will incur the wrath of the wait staff.  We're huge fans of standup comedy, so we'll keep going back to the Improv for more and more, but I just wish they had a good beer available in the balcony area.

Vegetarians & Vegans: you're gonna love Green, that's for sure. The place is 100% vegan ingredients & food. And it is delicious!  Everyone else: you're gonna like it too! Pretty much everyone that I've taken to Green or talked to that has been there (Vegetarian or not) has enjoyed the food. They've got an awesome selection of appetizers, entree items & deserts. Check em, yo.

Almost every single time we go, we have a great experience at My Big Fat Greek restaurant. Our latest trip (this past Saturday), was no exception.  Food was awesome, service was good and the overall experience was great.  Vegetarian recommendations: Greek Fries, Pizza Salad (so damn good), Vegetarian Moussaka, lemon potatoes & lemon rice.

Papa Razzini's is a great little family owned neighborhood Italian restaurant.  They start you out with some warm bread and a bowl of tasty bruschetta. This is one of the best "free" appetizers that you could get at any restaurant. Love it!  Their salads are pretty good, but the dressings are a bit thick. Due to this, we opted to go for an oil & vinegar dressing topping instead.  For the main course, I can emphatically recommend the Bird's nest dish. I absolutely love it. Angel hair pasta with garlic, basil and olive oil goodness. I don't know what they do, but they make it sooo delicious.  We love stopping in at this spot when we're out on the East side of town.

Meh, I stopped in at Horny Toad with my lady to have a drink. It was mid-day on a Sunday & the bar area was empty except for us. We didn't eat, but we had a couple of draft beers. The beers were over $4 each & they were served in small glasses. We didn't even get a full pint! Lameness, Horny Toad.

I give Richardson's 5 stars for their breakfast! We go here all the time for breakfast/brunch on the weekends and almost always enjoy it thoroughly. Note: I do not eat dinner there, as there is not much of a vegetarian selection besides their pizza.  But back to their fabulous breakfasts...  I absolutely love their enchiladas & eggs dish. I normally order my eggs fried over medium, which are then set atop cheese enchiladas covered in chile (get the red if you're vegetarian). The red chile is made just right, with the perfect amount of spiciness & flavor. The dish also comes served with delicious beans & potatoes.   The huevos rancheros are also damn good & are my number 2 pick.  The service is typically great. On one visit with some friends, we ordered a few prickly pear margaritas to start the day off right. When the drinks arrived and they didn't even look purple, we complained and our waiter happily brought us some extra prickly pear juice.  On another occasion, my girlfriend ordered a Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary's come with a shot of Mexi-beer. When we were casually chatting with our waiter and told him that we didn't like that type of beer, he swapped it out with a Chimay shot for free!  We love the food and they always treat us right, so we'll keep coming back.

One of my new favorite restaurants in my area.  Being vegetarian, I love the chinese vegetable quesadilla with their delicious hot sauce drizzled all over it. I normally get this with a refried bean burrito (combo), white rice and refried beans on the side. This is a ton of food. My girlfriend & I normally split this meal and are plenty full afterwards.  The finishing touch of a snickerdoodle cookie is fantastic. Love this place.

I still love Chino Bandido, even as a vegan.  My normal purchases are: A combo meal with veggie "quesadilla" (no cheese) + black bean burrito (no cheese), refried beans (no cheese) and white rice.  The veggie no cheese quesadilla still has a crisped up tortilla piled in with lettuce, broccoli & tomato bits. I drench it in their fantastic hot sauce & dab in some refried beans. The no cheese burrito still has the best texture as you bite through the just right chewy tortilla into the soft beans, drenched with hot sauce of course.  On the weekends, I like to get a tostada no cheese too.  The staff is always friendly and willing to highlight and accentuate the no-cheese requests on my order form.

We had a great experience at Spice Market Buffet. No line when we arrived around 1pm on a Monday.  The place is setup as a "tour around the world" type of buffet, with a station for American, Middle Eastern, Mexican (closed when I was there), Italian, Seafood, Asian, Desserts and maybe more.  Tons of options for vegetarians! The Middle Eastern area had some great stuff, I dug the mashed potatoes and mac n cheese from American and the garlic butter linguini was a winner on the Italian side.

The Roosevelt (http://twitpic.com/408gd ) has an impressive beer selection (both on draft and in bottles), very friendly staff and the place itself is very interesting. Beer prices are reasonable.  It is located inside of an old house that has been renovated and transformed into a bar. The place has high ceilings, unlike similar historic homes in the area.   We had a good time there on a Sunday afternoon, relaxin at the bar and chatting with the bar tenders.  We did not try the food.  We'll be back!

Stopped in for lunch and grabbed the pizza + salad + drink lunch special for $9. Nice deal.  The salad was tasty. I got the Margarita pizza (sauce, cheese, tomato, basil) and it was good. Super thin crust, charred to a good crispiness. Lots of strips of fresh basil on top, making it extra delicious. I love fresh basil ! I probably wouldn't go here for dinner, but the lunch specials are great!

This place gets 2 stars for adults. It might be a good spot to take some kids, but that's about it.  This miniature golf course is all indoors with Air Conditioning, which is a welcome feature for the hotter than imaginable AZ summers. All of the holes are constructed with green colored carpet, not turf like most mini golf courses.  The holes are mostly extremely easy as well, with the majority being a straight shot trajectory, usually through the legs of various animal statues. The course gets pretty boring since there is not much variety and hardly any hills, bumps, relief or other bank type shots.  We also had little kids jumping on our greens while we were in the middle of trying to putt on a few of the holes. Control your kids people!  If you're an adult looking for some mini golf, skip this course and go elsewhere.

I'm a fan of these types of Mexican restaurants. It's the line up and order what you want and they scoop all your ingredients onto your burrito right in front of you steez.  It's the Chipotle/Qdoba/Kokopelli/Cafe Rio style place.  What sets Bajio apart from these other spots? I think their restaurant is a bit nicer & they have some additional options that you might not find at the other guys.  3 types of beans: refried, black & spicy 2 types of rice: Mexican style & sweet TONS of types of sauces  If you're a fan of this type of Mexican & you want lots of choices, give Bajio a try.

Me looks at my tire tread and finds that it's looking very low. Me notices $50 off 4 tires Black Friday weekend discount online for Discount Tires. Me drives to Discount Tire and asks them to look at my tire tread & wear since I think they're about ready for replacement. Discount Tire guy finds 3 of the 4 tires ready for replacement. Me shows the Discount Tire guy that the tires didn't last their full 50,000 miles as guaranteed by the tire warranty. Discount tire guy says no problem and gives me a credit of $14 per tire. Me mentions that I saw the Discount Tire $50 off 4 tires discount online. Discount Tire guy says no problem and gives me the discount. Me leaves with 4 new Yokohama 80,000 mile warranty tires for around $360 out the door.  Very happy with Discount Tire, my only complaint might be that their installation/disposal fees, etc are a tad bit higher than say Costco. Other than that, wonderful experience. I'd recommend them.

As some previous reviewers have mentioned, Ginger China Bistro is reminiscent of the restaurant formerly known as Fate in downtown Phoenix.  I popped in for lunch this week as I was nearby due to GangplankNW http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23Gangplanknw  To get my ginger party started, I ordered up a "Ginger Palmer" (ginger iced tea + lemonade). Man, what a unique and tasty beverage!  For my entry, I ordered up the "Tofu puffs" with seasonal vegetables dish, which comes with white rice. This dish (and probably all of them) come served in a generous amount of sauce. The food was tasty & filling. Ginger Bistro is a good spot for some flavorful, not so traditional Chinese cuisine.

Sunflower is my new local grocery store. After deciding to go vegan, Fry's food was no longer good enough for our needs (not enough vegan options).  Sunflower to the rescue! Tons of faux products for vegans! meats, cheese, veganaise, sour cream, soy yogurt, etc.  Tons of fresh produce too. Sunflower is great for anyone looking for some more healthy grocery options. They rock!

In this world of automotive repair shop scammers, it's refreshing to find a car repair shop & automotive technicians that pride themselves on being fair, ethical, honest and professional.  Andre with Toyoworks is awesome. He's a certified, officially trained Toyota technician that used to work for a Toyota dealership.  He's always honest and upfront about everything, including what options you have regarding maintenance and repairs on your car.  If you have a problem that doesn't necessarily require immediate attention or repair, he'll let you know that. Most other shops would tell you that all problems need repair immediately, even if they don't.  If you need a new part that's very expensive direct from Toyota, he'll tell you that you can get it on the cheap at a junkyard if you want that option.  His service is always superb, friendly and professional. All of my experiences (including multiple repairs & maintenance) have been superb with Toyoworks. If you've got a Toyota, you should make them your go-to automotive shop.

Checked out this Whole Foods for the first time yesterday and we were very disappointed. Much smaller than other Whole Foods locations we've been to, less selection and pretty expensive (although most Whole Foods are expensive). I definitely won't be making any more special trips to this location.

As far as the breakfast goes, Sylvia's kicks some major arse. It is definitely one of my favorite spots to hit in Phoenix for some b-fast. Lunch or dinner, I cannot comment on, as I only go here for breakfast.  The place has a rockin chips & salsa bar. We start out our Mexi-break-feast by piling up some regular tortilla chips along with some tostada chips in a bowl. For dippin, they've got a red hot sauce, a traditional red salsa with tomato, onions, cilantro, peppers, etc and they also now have a creamy, spicy guaca-salsa, which is delicious!  Their coffee is unique and very good. It is a cinnamon spiced blend, which complements their food very well.  They have many Mexican breakfast items that you would expect, and some that you might not. One of our favorites is the breakfast quesadilla, which is pretty large & perfect for splitting with someone else. This tasty dish includes eggs, cheese, green chiles & some other stuff.  Their hashbrowns are delish and come with green chiles and cheese on top. Order a side of those to complement your meal.  The only reason I didn't give Sylvia's 5/5 is due to their service, which can sometimes be lame. Everything is ordered at the counter (no waiter/waitress) and sometimes there is no one to be found when you need something else. They can also be a pain to deal with if they mess up your order. Today we ordered a side of guacamole & we specifically asked for it on the side. Instead, they put a small amount of guac inside our breakfast quesadilla. When I tried to get a side after the fact due to their screwup, they gave me some flack. Try to improve your customer service a bit Sylvia's.

I would give My Big Fat Greek Restaurant 4.5 stars if possible, but since I can't, I'm rounding up in this instance.  We frequent the location in downtown Phoenix at the Arizona center. The outdoor patio seating is great, it has a nice view of the Arizona center plaza & park, with the calming sounds of the waterfalls right near the patio.  For starters, try the Greek fries. They serve a heft plate of french fries topped with a tart lemony sauce and cheeses (including feta). This app is delishhhh.  The Happy Hour (4-7pm) specials get my stamp of approval. They offer $3 large beers on tap, including some super good beers like Alaskan Amber. They're worth a visit just for their beer specials.  For the main courses, one of our favorite dishes is the pizza salad. You get a plate of warm, toasty pizza crust with a delicious salad thrown on top. The salad is dressed with feta cheese and a tasty balsamic vinaigrette dressing. It is very difficult for me to NOT order the pizza salad when I'm at MBFG restaurant.  Another good dish is the Vegetarian Mousaka (http://twitpic.com/46x9h ), however it can be a little bit sweet. The lemon potatoes and lemon rice are very tasty, if you're into lemon flavored sides.   Give MBFG restaurant a try, even if it's just for their happy hour beers.

Summary: stingy on the feta cheese and too much use of dried spices.  We started off our meal with a hummus app and 2 glasses of house wine (only $1.99/glass during happy hour, M-F, 4-7PM). No complaints about the wine and the hummus was decent.  Next up we received our Greek salads. Not much feta in the salad, not much cucumber, not much green pepper (I think there was one in mine).  For the main course, I ordered up the Greek spaghetti, which is one of my favorite Greco dishes. Again I was subjected to the attack of the missing feta, as they sparsely graced my plate with a few blocks of the good stuff. The pasta also had a good amount of dry spice mixed in with it, which wasn't very pleasing to eat.  I really wanted to like the Greek Patio, especially since it's close by to my house, but due to the issues above, I'll be sticking with the Golden Greek and My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. It's worth the drive for me.

Visited Armitage Bistro for the first time yesterday with high hopes, seeing as though it's a wine bar and we really love Bomberos, Postino and 5th & Wine elsewhere in the valley.  Ordered up a few glasses of wine for a special price of $5 on happy hour, which is normal HH pricing at a wine bar. The wine was good. Their happy hour lasts til 7pm, later than most other wine bars, which is a plus.  Appetizers were $5, so we sampled the Bruschetta, Warm Spinach Dip, Toasted Ravioli and a half order of french fries.  Let's start with the Bruschetta, you get to choose 4 types, so we went with 2 Tomato & Fresh Mozzarella, 1 Mushroom & Gorgonzola and 1 Chopped Tomatoes & Roasted Garlic.  As the bruschetta arrived, my first impression was that it was definitely a smaller portion than I'm used to receiving at other wine bars that I frequent. It's essentially one piece of some type of normal-sized sliced bread cut into 4 pieces and dressed up with different toppings. I much prefer the bread & portions at Bomberos & other spots.  The Tomato & Fresh Mozzarella bruschetta was highly UNimpressive. In fact, it really wasn't good. The tomato slices weren't red, they were thin, the fresh mozzarella wasn't impressive and there was barely any basil on them. Big bummer for us since this is usually our most favorite type of bruschetta.  On to the next type! The Chopped Tomatoes & Roasted Garlic was okay, but we didn't prefer it much due to the overly garlic flavor. If you're into garlic, you'll like the taste here, but again, the bread contributed to a disappointing experience with this bruschetta.  The Mushroom & Gorgonzola bruschetta was delicious! Definitely our favorite out of the different bruschetta types we sampled.  Next up we got the "Warm Spinach Dip" which is described on the menu as "Spinach, Artichoke Hearts, Irish Cheddar & Asiago Cheese  Served with Warm Bread & Pita".  I'm not familiar with Irish cheddar, but this dip was almost entirely cheese and had a very sticky/globby feel. There didn't seem to be much spinach/artichoke in it. We didn't really enjoy this dish.  Next up was the toasted ravioli. Not too shabby, but not overly impressive either. It was a good effort and we ate it with the provided marinara dipping sauce.  Lastly we got a half-order of seasoned french fries. These were pretty decent. They come with 2 sauces, one of which is a red-pepper ranch type sauce that was good. The other is a BBQ-esque sauce with some other twist, but we didn't really dig that one. I did enjoy dipping my french fries into the aforementioned cheese dip.  Overall for the price, and even at a discounted happy hour price, we didn't feel it was worth our money. The bruschetta could definitely use some improvement, especially the Tomato & Fresh Mozzarella variety.

Awesome loose leaf tea spot in the North Phoenix area. You can have a cup/pot of tea in-house, or buy a variety of teas to go.  HUGE selection of loose leaf teas. If you're a tea fan, a visit to Souvia is a must-do.

Looking for an A-MAZING vegan pizza (sans cheese)?   Follow our formula at Barro's: Order a veggie special pizza with no sauce and no cheese Ask them to use the white pizza mix as the sauce (oil, herbs and garlic) Add a side of marinara sauce for crust dippin if desired  Result = Stupidly awesome vegan pizza. We loved it.  WARNING: It seems the "white pizza mix" may have Parmesan cheese in it. Not sure if it varies by location or not, but we've been given different answers at different locations. I suggest speaking with a Manager at the location you are ordering from to confirm this. We've had to ask for just olive oil, garlic and herbs as the base on a few occasions (rather than the "white pizza mix").

Nice! An excellent Indian food restaurant in my hood.  The food is delish, the staff is super friendly and the decor is appropriate.  We enjoyed the garlic naan, a peas & cottage cheese dish and a cauliflower & potato dish. All were super tasty. Lots of vegetarian options.  I'm really glad we popped in to try this place out. We'll be back.

Fresh Mint rocks! Delicious food, a large variety of items on the menu, and it's all vegan except for the last entrée on the menu (#31 or #32 ?), which has egg noodles.  Their mock chicken is awesome! The perfect texture and chewiness.   Their main course entrées are pretty large, so it's easy to split a meal with someone else.  Looking forward to going back to try some more items on the menu!

Amante has some delicious salads, pastas and good pizza. The best part for me? It's right down the street from my house.   The decor is freakin awesome. Lots of columns & neat decorations, you'll feel like you're dining in an upscale restaurant, but the prices aren't that bad ($9 - $15 for most pasta dishes).   We really enjoyed the food, but they no longer have a liquor license. According to our server, they no longer serve alcoholic drinks since approximately 1 month ago. Again, I like the food, but I want some freakin wine with my Italian dinner. This short-coming will keep us from becoming repeat visitors.

Full Disclosure: This review pertains to a private anniversary event at Babaloo's. The restaurant invited food critics, the media and a few Yelp Elite members to attend the event. Food, drink & entertainment was provided to attendees at no cost.  Babaloo's started out by providing mojito's, with fresh mint (of course) and a delicious mix of ingredients. Text book mojito's, good stuff.  A Cuban band was on site to entertain the guests during the event. The music was very pleasant and entertaining. Babaloo's also hosts live music every Saturday night, according to their website.  A history of the restaurant was presented, discussing their Cuban family origins and how they meticulously create and maintain their recipes. This is a family owned restaurant that prides themselves in their food & its quality.  Wine & food tastings started shortly thereafter. Samplings were provided for 1 appetizer, 4 entrees & 1 desert. 4 different wines were paired with the food samplings & a 40 year aged rum was served with dessert.   3 out of the 4 wines were fantastic. The one wine I did not like may just have been a style that I don't enjoy.  Being a vegetarian, I couldn't try the majority of the food samplings as they all included meat, but my carnivorous table companions seemed to thoroughly enjoy the food. At one point, I was served a plate of some flavorful rice & beans over a crust and I did enjoy my little sides meal.  The dessert was fantastic & literally melted in my mouth. Absolutely loved it.   Many thanks to Babaloo's Cafe for inviting us and hosting the event. Thank you also to Gabi at Yelp for inviting us & to Nathan S. for the good conversation and taking "a real step up".

Hey vegans, they've got a menu guide just for you (ask for it), showing exactly what dishes are vegan and which are not. They'll also happily substitute ingredients in and out of any dish to make them vegan for you.   I recommend: the potato garlic dip, the hummus (get the regular pitas, the greek ones have dairy in them), thousand beans, the macro platter and there are a few more good ones as well.

This is my favorite theater near my North Phoenix residence. Why?  1) The theater is pretty new, which means good audio/visual equipment, comfortable seating and a bright & shiny experience. 2) Harkin's T-shirt program! You can buy a Harkin's tee for around $20, which allows you to get a free popcorn all year long at any Harkin's theater. Even if I'm not hungry, the smell of fresh popped corn at the theater will get me running to scoop some up. I luv me some poppin corn! Yes, I'm an addict.  We go here when we're not doing a early bird $5 special at AMC DeerValley 30.

AMC Deer Valley 30 is close to my pad and convenient. It's a regular ol modern movie theater, nothing too special, nothing to alarming. As the name implies, there are 30 different theaters inside, so movie hoppers rejoice here.  We like to hit it before noon on Sundays to take advantage of the $5 early bird ticket price specials.

Fresh baked breads, delish soups, salads & sandwiches. Lots of vegetarian options. This place does it right! Entrees with fresh & uniquely mixed ingredients dot the menu. On my most recent visit, I opted for the sweet potato sandwich and a creamy artichoke soup. Both were very good.

Yesterday my wife and I both had a "half" of the roasted sweet potato sandwich, which normally comes with "roasted sweet potato, fresh mozzarella, fig confit, tomato, arugula, marinated fennel and Balsamic Vinaigrette on Herb Focaccia". Obviously, we get it without the mozzarella, and it's fantastic! The half sandwich is still big, don't know if I could eat a whole one.  We also both got a bowl of the vegetarian chili, which is vegan. It was also fantastic.  Lots of vegan bread options and otherwise (hummus plate, salads, etc).   I appreciate that they use a wide variety of unique ingredients, veggies & herbs, that you don't normally find at most other restaurants. We'll definitely be frequenting Wildflower more often now.

Seeing the word "hippies" in the restaurant name had me stoked, as them tree-huggin hippie types got to have some vegetarian food, right? Yep.  I walked up to the lil window and asked about the veggie options, the guy behind the counter informed me that they have a cactus burrito and that it was one of his favorites. Score! Or so I thought...  Upon receiving the large, heavily stuffed burrito, I bit in with high hopes. Those hopes quickly dissipated as I found that the innards of the burrito were primarly COLD. The cactus pieces were cold, the cheese wasn't melted at all. The only thing that had a bit of warmth were the beans, which weren't even hot, they were luke warm.  Sorry guys, but a cold burrito isn't going to cut it. Make that cactus, beans and rice HOT in your burritos if you want some customers. Melt the friggin cheese in there, don't leave it ice cold.

My quest for the perfect breakfast burrito near my hood led me to Poliberto's this morning. At $3.25/breafastirito, their prices are good.  My potato/egg/cheese burrito was tasty & so was their hot sauce. The green is hotter than the red.  I added guacamole to my rito when I ordered, but when I got home and started gouging myself & chowing down, I was a bit disappointed to find that the bit of guac was concentrated almost entirely near the bottom of the burrito. Other than the guac skimping, I thoroughly enjoyed the burrito & will most likely be back. The quest continues!

Recently visited Hanny's for the first time and received crap service from a waitress with an attitude. She was not willing to happily accommodate any requests and acted put-off at anything we asked about or asked for. Plus, the place wasn't even busy while we were there, it was pretty empty. That's how you drive customers away.

Checked out Next Coffee today for #GangplankNW  The place is spacious, with lots of tables, chairs, couches & bar areas to work from.  On Thursdays & Friday's, they have an omelet bar, cooking up made to order omelets. I tried a veggie omelet with feta & parmesan & thoroughly enjoyed it.  They have a couple different Iced Tea choices, with free refills included. I tried a green iced tea with fruit flavors & it hit the spot.  The WiFi was acceptable for the majority of the time I was there. At one point, I could not pull any data & could not reach the DHCP server. After rebooting my PC, I was able to reconnect with no issues.  Next is a great place to grab some coffee, tea, breakfast and meet up with some people. I'll be visiting regularly.

As Arik mentioned in his review, this place can make some good pies. If you're looking to pick up a pie or grab some dessert, this spot can be a good option.  As far as dining here for lunch or dinner, it's nuthin special. American cuisine with no real surprises. They have an ok salad bar & can have some good soups (cheesy potato!) on hand, depending on what they made that particular day.  They have just about zero vegetarian entree options on the menu. If you're a veg head dragged along to this place for a meal, you'll probably have to custom order some pasta with veggies or get creative in another manner. I'll be trying my best to avoid the place for meals, but meat-eaters might find something enjoyable...

Best chips EVR!!!!! Gil's makes their own tortilla chips from scratch & they are absolutely fantastic. I also particularly enjoy the green chile salsa, so delish.  For the main course, I ordered up a cheese enchilada with chile relleno combo. Food items were drenched in a good amount of chile sauce. The chile relleno was deeeelishous. The cheese enchilada itself was nothing too special & I didn't eat much of it. The rice & beans were delish. Rice was thick & tasty. Everything is made to order and home made, which shows in the food.  No alcoholic beverages served at this restaurant, which is one drawback.

I've always wondered what a breakfast pizza would be like and I finally found out at my visit to Scramble. I ordered up the Garlic Spinach, Thyme & Mushroom brizza (which also comes with some type of cheese, possibly provolone). This thing was delish!   My girl ordered up the ham & cheddar brizza, but she liked mine even more and proceeded to steal one of my slices.  Scramble also scores extra points with me for having loose-leaf teas. I got a cup of the Gun-Powder Green Tea Mint, which was very good.  We were bummed that the hashbrowns were pre-made with bacon inside, as it made them no option for vegetarians like me.  We sat outside at their very slick & shaded outdoor patio and dining area. Cmon down, ya gotta try a breakfast pizza!

Love, love, love that they have a new vegan menu!  Scramble has all the options down pat, they've even got 4 vegan breakfast entrées, some great loose leaf teas, fresh made OJ, soy milk, various flavors of hot sauces and more. Their outdoor patio is rad. They're pet and kid friendly. I also highly appreciate the fact that they use separate cookware and plates for their vegan dishes.  My biggest problem with Scramble is their consistency. The food just doesn't come out the same way every time.  My first visit to try the tofu/soyrizo burrito resulted in a burrito that was extra oily and sweet potato hash that was blackened (burnt) and extra oily.  My next visit (today) resulted in a burrito with tofu that wasn't cooked/seasoned as well as the last time (big chunks of white tofu). The sweet potato hash was good this time.  I'd also like to see a bit more soyrizo added to the burritos.  The miniature cup of salsa provided with these dishes should also be increased in size, as it's easy to run through in a few bites.  I still really dig the place, I just hope that they get their cooking/prep down so that the dishes turn out more consistent and better.  I'd also like to see a vegan Brizza (breakfast pizza) added to the menu (with tofu instead of egg).

hobo eggs dish = ridiculous. My waiter warned me that it was "alot of food". I thought, ok, it's gonna be a big plate of food.  I was wrong, way wrong. It's not a big plate of food, it is a MOUNTAIN of food! http://twitpic.com/awqxk A tasty mountain of hashbrowns, onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers & eggs, with the majority of it being hashbrowns. This behemoth of a serving had me shocked & joyed. Crazy Otto's made my day yesterday. I'll be eating leftovers all week.

Disclaimer: I am a Vegetarian.  Today I checked out the newly opened Loving Hut on 35th Ave & Union Hills in North Phoenix. The food was fantastic.  I ordered the NY "steak" combo (pic: http://twitpic.com/3qbwy ), which came with a soup of the day (very tasty vegetable soup), rice (brown or white), some side veggies (cabbage, carrots, snap peas) and eggplant with tofu.  The eggplant with tofu was very good, the skin was not chewy at all like in many other eggplant dishes, it almost melted in my mouth and it was very tasty.  The actual NY "steak" was more like a crispy faux chicken, but it was still pretty good and came with a curry dipping sauce.  They also have a wide variety of other food menu items. The drink menu is also impressive. Many fresh made juices, smoothies, teas, etc. I opted for a not-so-exotic Jasmine iced tea and added some organic brown sugar found on the counter.  My entire meal including my drink was about $9 and left me with a full belly. Plates range around $6 - $10.  The only downside I saw with this place is the "supermastertv", which is playing on two ~42" plasmas hanging on opposite walls of the dining room. The channel is playing animal rights groups & animal cruelty content nonstop. To be clear, I have no problem with advocating no harm to animals, but I don't want to see slaughterhouse videos and animal abuse footage while I am eating. I would be much more comfortable if they played some other non-graphic content there.  Overall I was very satisfied and I will be turning this into a regular lunch & dinner spot.

Alright Loving Hut, let's face the facts, I love you and you love me. Your "strategery" of using "Love" in your establishment name has paid off, as you have enamored me with your delicious, 100% vegan food as well as your kind & friendly staff. I eat here all the time. We even get their food for parties.   Vegetarians, Vegans & Omnivores alike will find something to enjoy at Loving Hut. In particular, I can wholeheartedly recommend the "Spicy Cha Cha", a unique faux breaded shrimp dish that I have seen no where else, made with Yam protein. Yes, it's delicious & amazing.  Keep on rockin on, North Phoenix Loving Hut.

My lovely woman and I stayed at the Clarendon this past weekend, so we had plenty of encounters with Gallo Blanco and we dug it.  You can't go wrong with their fresh, made when you order it, guacamole and house-made tortilla chips. That is some damn good guac! In addition to the normal ingredients that you would expect (avocado, tomato, onion, spices) they also include some tangerine or a similar fruit in there, giving it a tasty variation. We ordered it as an app before dinner and also during the day while we were chillin poolside. Good stuff!  The grilled corn appetizer (Elote Callajero) with cotija cheese and smoked paprika is also a unique and tasty treat. They'll even cut it in half for ya if you want to share with someone else.  For din-din, my girl enjoyed their fish tacos more than the carne asada taco.   I was satisfied with the veggie tacos. A good mix of grilled veggies and other taco goodies was included, along with a fresh lime. Gotta love fresh lime juice squeezed on fresh ingredient packed tacos.  If you want a little somethin extra, their house-made french-fries are delicious and will only run you $2 for a side.  The dining area has large glass windows that you can sit up against, which is pretty cool and allows for a good view of the surrounding area.  The bar area had a live music performance on Saturday night, which was a welcome addition.  My only suggestion for Gallo Blanco would be to expand their drink selections and availability. I'd like to see a good pale ale (like Sierra Nevada) put on tap there. They do have a Oak Creek Hefeweisen and a Nimbus Dark Amber, so I give them props for covering those beer styles, but I still want a good pale ale.   As far as mixed drinks go, my girlfriend wanted a Strawberry Daiquiri to sip on while we were lounging poolside and they were unable to make one for us. After I found that out, I asked if they could make a strawberry anything for her and they agreed to make a strawberry margarita, although they seemed very reluctant to do so.  Overall, the environment is awesome, the service is good and the food is good. I would definitely recommend that you check it out.

Upgrading Gallo Blanco to 5 stars as it is now one of our favorite places to eat downtown.  Even after switching to eating vegan, Gallo Blanco still rocks for us!   I'd recommend: Chips & guacamole with no cheese (some of THE best guac in town) A couple veggie tacos (these come with no cheese by default)  Other options: side of jasmine rice with green tomatillo salsa side of beans with no cheese + more  Both their red & green spicy sauces are vegan and delicious (ask for them!!).  My previous qualms about their beer selection have been resolved. They have a tasty craft-brewed amber or pale ale on tap almost every time that we visit.

I'm stoked to have another decent breakfast spot close to my house. Tiny's is good ol' home cooked style food.  I ordered up the Spanish omelet, which has some fluffy eggs, cheese and their secret family spanish sauce on top (which is a tomato based sauce with celery, onion, tomato & maybe some other ingredients). It was pretty good.  The hashbrowns are awesome. I love the thinly sliced potatoes that are cooked up crispy on the top layer. Good stuff.  The inside of the place is nicely decorated and the bar seating area is pretty cool looking. The service was friendly and accommodating. We'll be back.

I popped into La Mirage today to try them out. Their lunch specials are very reasonable. For $5.99, you can choose any sandwich (served on a pita), choose soup or salad and get a fountain drink included.  I ordered up the potato and vegetable sandwich with house salad and an iced tea. The meal also came served with a basket of cut pita bread and some cabbage soaked in some type of yellow oil or sauce. The green house salad was very tasty. Good dressing with a good amount of herbs & spices mixed in. It would have been nice if it had feta on it too, but I can't really complain due to the awesome lunch special price.  The sandwich was good, but it was a little dry. Luckily, my very friendly server brought me out a side of tahini sauce at my request. So if you're going to order up one of their "dry" sandwiches, ask for a side of some sauce or dressing too.  One thing that really surprised me is that they don't make or even carry any tzatziki sauce! Seriously?  A Mediterranean spot with no tzatziki? Yep. I overlooked this one small flaw due to their tasty food and their awesome lunch special deals. I'll be back to try some of their other stuff.

This place is a fast foodish style Greek spot where you order at the counter and they bring you your food.  The restaurant itself is located on the very west end corner of the complex that houses the AMC Deer Valley 30 Movie Theater and was formerly a Souper Salad. Upon arrival, we immediately encountered a problem while walking up to the restaurant. Something outside smelled like sewer & it was very gross. This seemed to carry into the restaurant a little bit too. Despite this problem, we proceeded to order and try out the place.  I ordered up the Vegetarian combo that comes with a greek salad, hummus, tiropita (cheese pie), falalfel and pita bread. My girlfriend ordered a chicken plate that came with thinly sliced chicken pieces, "greek" fries, rice and a salad.   My meal was pretty decent, everything was just "ok". Nothing extraordinary or outstanding. My girlfriend didn't like the greek salad dressing, claiming that it tasted too "olivey". She also didn't like the rice, which was pretty plain and didn't taste like lemon whatsoever. The "greek" fries didn't seem very greek at all. They appeared to be non-house made fresh fries with a bit of seasoning on them. She said the chicken was OK.  Mid-way through our meal, the Greek music CD that they were playing in the restaurant started skipping. Now we all know how annoying a skipping CD is. It's basically an ear-wrenching, headache inducing nightmare. Not a big problem if they would've fixed it right away, but they let this POS audio-bomb go for at least 10 minutes before fixing it. C'mon guys, get your act together.

Wet 'n' Wild is now open in Glendale, off Pinnacle Peak on 43rd Ave. This park replaces the now defunct WaterWorld. $30 million was spent on building the 30 new slides and attractions at the brand new park. We checked out the park on one of the season pass holders preview days.  This is certainly a hundred times better than the old, crappy Waterworld park. It is by far the best amusement park in Arizona. We had a great time checking out a bunch of the new slides and we will be here often during the hot AZ summer. Lots of big slides for adults and big kids and also a kiddie area for the little ones.  I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 due to the following drawbacks: They charge for parking, even if you are a season pass holder. There is no alcohol served on site. They charge for renting intertubes if you want to use a tube at the wave pool. No towels are provided.  Other than these few negatives, Wet 'n' Wild is an impressive waterpark and a much needed addition to the blistering valley of the sun. Go get yourself some Wet 'n' Wild.

YMMV (Your Massage May Vary) at Arizona School of Massage Therapy. Fortunately for me, my last 2 visits have resulted in a kick @$$ massage. All for the small price of $25.   Sometimes you'll get a newer student masseuse who doesn't do it quite right, but a little coaching on adding more pressure should help you get your massage a bit back on track.   YMMV also depending on what time of year you go. Right now, they are mostly veteran masseuses who have been doing it since August/September. Starting in March, they'll be getting a new class and the massages will get suckier. They do at least, offer buy 1 get 1 free massage coupons during the time when a new class starts, so keep an eye out for those.  Overall, we love the place and get our cheapo massages here often.  Note: This review is from a massage consumer perspective only, I am not reviewing the school's program itself.

Need a TV repaired at your house? Then I would definitely recommend calling Emmett's!  They repair TV's in home, anywhere in the Phoenix area.  I called up Emmett's Fix-It Shop television repair to see if they could help me fix the broken coaxial tv tuner jack on my 42" Panasonic plasma HDTV.   After providing my TV model # and explaining the issue, the folks at Emmett provided me with a few options to get my television repaired. Even though they were unable to obtain the specific part that I needed, they agreed to do the install work if I obtained the part on my own. I was able to locate the part online, ordered it, got it delivered and then called up Emmett's to schedule the install.  Emmett's came to my house, worked their soldering magic and installed the new part. My TV is now back to 100% health. The people from Emmett's were very friendly, professional and courteous. I highly recommend them for your TV repair needs.

Stopped in here for lunch the other day. Quiet little independent Chinese restaurant that also has a Hawaiian style menu.  Not many options for vegetarians, no tofu dishes to be found. Didn't really dig my noodles + veggies + pineapple dish, hence the 2 star rating.

w00t! A coffee spot that carries almond milk! Now I know what you must be thinking... "big deal, almond milk?" ... but yes, it is a big deal, a VERY big deal.   You see, 99% of coffee shops choose to solely carry soy milk alone as their non-dairy creamer alternative. Unfortunately, you are currently reading the writings of a vegan who is allergic to soy milk, makes my throat all itchy and sore feeling, but I digress...   Royal made me happy by offering almond milk and I happily slurped down my iced vanilla almond milk latte while traversing the many wonders of the Phoenix open air public market on Saturday morning.  -1 star since I had to mix up my drink myself.  Take note other coffee shops: please carry another non-dairy creamer besides soy milk.

Stopped in on a Sunday and had a few glasses of wine on the shaded, mister-sprayed, patio area.  All glasses of wine are $5 til 6pm, every single day. Awesome. We also mentioned Yelp and got $2 glasses of a tasty St. Francis Chardonnay thx to a special I spotted on Yelp for Android (could be gone now).  Bruschetta was pretty good, but the fresh mozzarella was a bit runny & mushy. I would've preferred a more solid/chewy fresh mozz. They also use small cherry tomatoes instead of tomato slices, which Tera didn't like. Even so, we still had a great time and I wish there was a spot just like this next door to our neighborhood.

I love this place! Being a beer lover, I was excited to hear that they carried close to 40 beers on tap. I knew I had to go check the place out, just due to that. We stopped by on a Saturday (and then again on Sunday) for beers & food.  When I asked for a beer menu, the server told me that they pretty much no longer carry any of the crap domestics (Budweiser, Michelob, etc). +1!  They have plenty of craft ales and lagers to choose from, so even a budwiper lover can find something good here. To the more seasoned beer veteran, there are a plethora of beers will statisfy your tastes. Everything from seasonal summer ales to stouts and everything else you can think of, from good breweries. They have a large selection of beers from Rogue, Stone, Abita, Left Hand, Four Peaks, Sonoran and many more. Nice to see them carrying the local stuff too.  For starters, we've tried the chopped salad (sans pepperoni) and a parmesan garlic pretzels. Both were superb. The pretzels appear to be made out of pizza dough and they are oh so delish.  For the main course, I've ordered up 2 different hoagies, both times with Tempeh.  Vegetarians listen up! This place has you covered. They've got grilled Tempeh, jerk Tempeh, pesto Tempeh, BBQ Tempeh and Tofu as well.  I've had the "tempeh hoagie" and the "jerk" hoagie with tempeh subbed in. Both were immensely enjoyed and quickly devoured. If you're a vegetarian that's missing a cheese-steak style meal, get your arse over to Mellow Mushroom and try out one of their tempeh hoagies.

A hole in the wall Chinese fast food spot with some "tasty" options. Tofu dishes for veggie heads too!  Ryan C described this place perfectly, so check out his review ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-house-chinese-restaurant-phoenix#hrid:dPH4TU9Ys-04gmbkYPj5Yg ) to get a good picture of what this place is like.  I dropped in for lunch today and was also impressed by the $5 lunch specials. Unfortunately, they had zero tofu dishes available on the lunch special menu (there are 3 or so tofu dishes on the dinner menu). I inquired about this fact and they hooked me up with a custom tofu dish lunch special deal! Now that's good customer service!  I got the tofu with vegetables dish, which is some tasty thinly sliced tofu, deep fried and doused in a ameri-chino sauce. A selection of vegetables is also tossed in, with white rice and a veggie eggroll finishing off the dish. All this for $5.XX! Noice!  I really dug their tofu dish and the low prices. I'll be back to try their other offerings.

Terrible experience so far with Segway of Tempe.  I purchased 2 Segway tour passes at a discounted rate when a deal showed up for them on Groupon.  Because we purchased passes through Groupon, we could not use their standard "Reservations" 800 number to book our tour, we had to call Segway of Tempe directly to book it.  Our first attempt was before Memorial day, we found out they were doing tours on Memorial day itself (a Monday), so I called the number specified on the Groupon pass on Saturday trying to reserve a tour for us. I left 2 voicemails asking if we could get in on a Memorial day tour. Now I realize this was the weekend and they might not get to the voicemails in time to get me on a Monday tour, but I thought that I would at LEAST get the courtesy of a callback sometime the next week. Nope. No one ever called me back.  Fast forward to last week. The weather on Saturday was predicted to be much cooler than normal, dropping down to a high of 90. Perfect time for us to do a Segway tour before the temps are above 100 every day.  So during a weekday last week, I called and actually got someone on the phone. I then reserved a tour for Saturday at 10AM.   We show up on Saturday, at 10AM and the Segway of Tempe doors are locked and no one is there. I call their 480 number multiple times, it rings, no one answers.  I then call their 800 number reservations line, speak to a representative and they even confirm that they see I've got a reservation for today at 10AM. They suggest that I call someone at a 623 number.  We call the 623 number, a woman answers and tells us that maybe the tour guide didn't show up. She says that she will call us back.  So then we see 3 Segways zipping along crossing the Mill Avenue bridge. We wave and shout to them, they see us, but they just keep driving along over the bridge.  We sit around for 15 more minutes, and the 3 Segways that we saw earlier drive up to the Segway of Tempe office where we are waiting.  The tour guide, a male, tells us that he "didn't know" that we had a tour booked for today and that they don't even have 2 more Segways available for us to use today. He tells me that the female would call us back to try to "work something out" with us. I give him my mobile phone number again to confirm my number with him. He then leaves with his 2 customers to continue with their Segway tour.  So at this point, we're pretty aggravated, but we take off, expecting to get a call soon offering us a tour later that day or perhaps on Sunday.   Nope, we NEVER received any call back whatsoever.  So on a Saturday morning, we skipped breakfast, drove 34 minutes across town only to be denied a tour that we had already reserved and then we never got a call back from Tempe of Segway at any point. Talk about terrible Customer Service...

Pink Pepper has undergone an ownership change & been renamed to Tara Thai.   The food remains very similar and the staff is still very friendly.  I popped in for lunch the other day with fellow Yelpers Daren C. & Ryan C. and we indulged ourselves on their boofay.  The first part about the $8.XX lunch buffet that made me happy was that it includes an Iced Tea. Score!  The buffet offers a wide selection of options, from soup, rice, noodles, spring rolls, egg-rolls, tofu, vegetable dishes to many meat options (which my dining buddies appreciated). For me, I was happy to find a good amount of vegetarian dishes. One of the workers happily gave me a tour of the buffet area to show me what was veggie-friendly and what wasn't. Awesome service!  I really enjoyed the food and I'll be back. Especially for lunch!  A few other tid-bits:  They will not accept Entertainment book coupons for Pink Pepper.   When chatting with one of the staff members, they informed me that the owner also has a Tara Thai restaurant in Sedona & Prescott, so the empire is expanding.  They tell me the large Pink Pepper sign on the exterior of the building will soon be changed.

This place ROCKS! Very cool shop, large and roomy, lots of seats, nicely decorated, good vibe, decent outdoor area with additional seating.  They carry soy, almond and rice milk, which is totally awesome for a vegan like me that has a soy milk intolerance.   They've got some vegan packaged bars and oatmeal options, which is pretty cool.  They've got a loyalty discount program, which is cool and you can even place your order via text message in advance! r0x0r!  I'd give em 5 stars if they started carrying at least one vegan baked good. Their entire baked goods case has zero vegan options.

I've utilized Kristena Malgren's CPA services to compile my tax return forms for the past 2 years. Kristena has been a pleasure to work with, is always willing to research and answer questions and has very affordable rates. I'd highly recommend her for all your tax preparation and other accountant needs.

Awesome new veg spot! Love the salad bar concept with tons of options: salads, slaws, hummus, potato salads, bean mixes, quinoa & more. You pay for salad bar items by weight, so a good strategy is to load up on the light weight items such as the kale salad and then order an entree/wrap/sandwich from the menu.  Stoked to have another restaurant serving tons of vegan options in the valley! We'll definitely be back!

Tammy is awesome! My wife is pregnant with twins in a high risk pregnancy and we wanted to get her some professional relief with massage therapy. Apparently Tammy is one of the only (if not THE only) massage therapists in the Phoenix area with a Prenatal massage certification. She is thorough and makes sure that your doctor approves of the massages and lets her know of any restrictions. She was a pleasure to work with and a great masseuse!

This place has a monopoly on high profile stand up comedy in the valley, and they know it. They use that monopoly to their advantage with abusive policies (to the customer) and bad service. Their policies are total crap.   We recently bought some tickets to a 7PM show and when we found out that we couldn't attend that show, we called and tried to get our tickets swapped to the 9:45PM show. After emailing and calling multiple times (and leaving voicemails), I finally got someone on the line. They went on and on about how there are no refunds  or transfers whatsoever, but then they went on to say that they could check with their supervisor to see if we could exchange our tickets for the 9:45PM show. The person got back to me and said, yes, we could exchange our tickets to the later show, but there would be a $5 transfer charge per ticket. I asked him how they could have a transfer fee if their policy doesn't even allow transfers/exchanges? He couldn't answer that one, of course. We opted to do the exchange and attended the show.  Once you get there, you'll note that the place is extremely packed with chairs. They sardine as many people as possible into the venue. Many of the seats and arrangements are uncomfortable in my opinion. Once you are wedged into your seat, you are then reminded that they "require" that you purchase 2 drinks during your stay, at highly inflated prices, of course. They don't have hot tea as a beverage option any more (they used to) and I hear the iced tea is $10 a glass. In addition, gratuity is automatically added to your bill, so even if your service is bad, your server gets a tip anyway!  I love stand up comedy, but I despise this place. I won't be attending their shows and dealing with their heavy handed, turnip squeezing tactics.

What a breath of fresh fresh air. The owner of this restaurant actually took my constructive criticism and made some very positive changes based on them. How awesome is that?  Regarding the rice, apparently the staff who previously told me that they used chicken stock was misinformed. The owner showed me the seasoning they use and it is all veggie!  They're also now carrying a vegan lentil soup daily and it's delicious!  The pitas contain no dairy, which is awesome.  This place makes some great veggie food and the owner is very friendly and responsive to customer needs.  Definitely recommend that you check this place out!

We stopped in Wy-Knot Cafe this weekend as we had heard they have some vegan options. The entire experience was great!   We had some delicious seared tofu sandwiches (they press extra firm tofu, cut it thin and quick fry it to make it crispy), a super tasty vegetable soup, a beet salad, a side of breakfast potatoes and a couple of iced lattes with almond milk.   The service was good and the owner was very friendly and chatted with us about her vegan options and food.  We'll be back! Can't wait to try their tofu scramble and their TLT (Tempeh Lettuce Tomato) sandwich.  Note: They do not have any vegan butter/margarine, nor do they have any vegenaise. Hope they start carrying those both soon!

Loved this place! Kids eat free on the weekend!   Great vegan options. Choice of white rice, brown rice, or rice noodles as a base, and fried tofu (regular or spicy) as a main protein option.   Lots of good veggies and sauces as add ins! We were told all sauces are vegan with the exception of the Thai sauce, which has fish oil.   An extra side of rice is free, which is great for kids. Getting extra sauces is also free, which is great.  Don't forget crushed peanuts on top as a finisher!
