I will only come here for my car. Gab and his team give me the best service as well as factory parts only. They don't try to charge me for things that aren't broken.

Went in the middle of the week and was surprised to see it was packed! The place is very clean and they have wait staff that walk around to take orders for food and drink instead of having you walk to the other side of the place to get food. Food came out hot and good portions. Had a great time with a party of 4 and will be returning!

Four stars because the service is usually very good and food has never been a problem. Some visits are off. A few times it has taken awhile for staff to notice a group of us standing at the door waiting to be sat. Yesterday evening we were sat at a table and a waiter from a different section had to come over and "take us" since he was not sure who our original waiter was.  As I said before, won't be 3 stars because it's usually a great experience but lacking a star due to several issues with service.

I used to come here when it was known as Kashman's! Some of the same guys still work there and they are as friendly as ever. Nothing has changed much except some of the wall decor and the name. The food is always great, the staff is warm and happy to be there, and even the customers are happy and welcoming! Always a great place to catch breakfast with friends.

I'm familiar with the North located in Kierland, so the food was amazing as usual. This location was by far my favorite. It looks small from the street and has a nice sign at the front, but the restaurant itself is wide open and large. The decor is wonderful.  We sat outside on the patio per our reservation request and the patio was beautiful. It was a nice night. The lights were pretty and you could see the street but they put enough foliage that you weren't listening or seeing too much of the traffic.  Our waitress was very friendly and checked on us often. The food was perfect and we were left extremely happy.

What an awesome place for lunch! Excellent location (right by US Airways Center and not too far from the Ballpark). Brought co-workers out for lunch. Any attire is welcome. Very nice decor and ambiance. The staff is very attentive and nice!  Taking a look at the menu, the food was very reasonably priced! For the way the restaurant looks, you'd think you'd be paying more, but I was incorrect! Food came out pretty quickly and in very nice portions, and plated very nicely! Everything was excellent.  Absolutely coming back whenever I need a nice sit-down meal.

Amazed this place is still open. Food portions are small and overpriced. The food comes out either really good or really bad. No regularity in quality. Staff is always not attentive and look miserable. Came once to try it and came back to give it a second chance. Not fooling me three times.

AMAZING! A group of us go every Friday for co-worker/group lunch. The staff there will recognize us and seat us as quickly as possible (on a Friday at noon, it understandably takes time sometimes). Service has always been impeccable, drinks are refilled and we're checked on multiple times during the meal.  Food is fantastic! High quality sashimi and the range of available rolls is great! Everything costs what you would expect and nothing is overpriced.  Always look forward to Friday lunch here as it is a treat to end the week on!

Decided to try this hotel out for a "Spring Break" vacation with my girlfriend. The check-in process was very easy. Our room was ready when we arrived, the drive staff was very attentive and unloaded our bags for us while we checked in and then offered to get us to the room with a tour of the grounds.   We stayed in the room facing Camelback Mountain which is situated in the back of the property. We were given a cart ride with our bags and they were set-up in the room for us. I was impressed with how large the room was. It had a very nice patio, big bed, desk/table space, plenty of closet space, and a very impressive bathroom with full tub and separate shower.  The grounds are very beautiful as we took a walk around. The pools are nicely placed in the middle of the facility so they were not far at all to walk to.  For the price, it was the best valued hotel I've stayed at in awhile. We were also told to stay in the summer when rates are much lower and I definitely plan on returning!

Brought 6 friends to an 8pm reservation and we met up with a few strangers all going into the same room as us. While waiting for the room to open, the lady in the front was super nice and conversational. I forgot the name of the room, but it had to deal with a bank heist. We walked into a much larger room than I had expected that was set up like a bank. The first few clues were fairly easy, but got progressively more difficult and entertaining. The screen with the clock on the wall and the clues from the two way mirror were very cool additions.  Everyone had a great time! There was a lot of team building going on, so it would be great from events as such. The people who work there assigned to your room help from time to time with clues to help when you're close to solving a clue but not quite there.  The only negative thing I could say was that the clues weren't as challenging as I had hoped. Mostly key related, though the beginning had some very cool contraptions.  Very good experience, will definitely do another room again!
