5 star service my butt! I literally saw 3 people come in and just stand in the lobby. No greeting from the owner...nothing! I left. Will never come back or recommend.

No stars! Walk to the restroom and see the salsa and so called bean dip sitting on the counter with the dirty dishes and other cleaning equipment. I should have left then. Seriously on the cusp of calling the health dept on them.

Usually we get our pup shaved but with it being late October, we didn't want her to be cold, they suggested the furminator. NOT effective. Our pup is shedding like a mad man and our money is gonzo. Oh well lesson learned.

Exceptional Staff! Friendly service, Great cuts for the dogs. They both came home strutting a little taller after being there.   Great prices compared to Petsmart. My one dog there alone was $65. Both my dogs at this place were less than that by $10.  Great Deal.

Missing the great work the boys and girls did at Danny's. Had a free wash, got a free wash then had to clean and vacuum the inside myself at home because they did a crummy job. Going to look outside the former Danny's family locations for a good wash. Sad

I'm a bit honest but here are my expectations. Arrive to restaurant, greeting by hostess, wait for table, arrive at table, be served, eat, pay, leave. Pita Jungle got the first parts right but we waited oh about 5-8 minutes for any of the 12 hipster servers to acknowledge that we hadn't been served yet, once we received a server he was hit and miss the rest of the way, had to ask for utensils, ask for refills and generally felt as we were breaking up their conversations. We eat out a lot and from all different levels of establishments, 10 table 20 table & chain so we expect what we deserve. The food was usual pita jungle,  not impressive. Date of service 8-22-15

Thadius came to the rescue. Old cheap gate finally broke after many injuries. Was able to reach him immediately, send him photos via text for estimate, very responsive and provided same day service. I understand that can not always be achieved by lucky for me and most of his clients, he is business focused and earn every nickel I paid him. Provided outstanding service and was professional the whole way thru. If you have something metal break...dont replace it without calling him first. Save us 1000s on not having to buy a new gate.

Scott Berger, the owner, is by far the most friendly passionate jeweler in town. I dare you to find a better man for the job.

Meatball parm was like ground beef in a ball shape that tasted like meat paste. No stars this go round if I could. Stomach says -1 star.

If you like good service don't expect it here. Lousy at best. Table of 12 with only two other couples in the restaurant. Drinks stayed empty,  no ask for appetizers or dessert. Will not come back.

Outstanding service and management. When I ordered they were fresh out of Barbacoa so I ordered steak instead to not hold up the line. The manager gal who is awesome btw...comp'd my burrito. Always friendly, always clean. Much easier to get in and out of than the Kierland location.
