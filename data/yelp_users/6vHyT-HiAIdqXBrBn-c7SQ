This morning I needed to make a Home Depot run after dropping off my daughter at school. I walked in the door, was greeted by friendly staff and quickly found the coffee and restrooms. The coffee was hot and the bathrooms were clean. Everything that I needed was easy to find and the prices were all appropriate.

I started taking my vehicles to NAR after reading all of the great reviews here on Yelp. I have to agree with the 5 star rating. Randy, the owner, has been in the shop handling customer service every time I've been there and I have to agree that he is honest and works hard to get your car back on the road as quickly as possible. His prices are very reasonable.  His price for an oil change is great and he won't try to hit you up for an up-sell unless it's something that is really necessary to the well functioning of your vehicle. One word of advice, though, the waiting room is tiny, so don't plan on waiting too long for your work to be done if you are claustrophobic.

I noticed one of the employees pulling lettuce out of a tub to make my salad without washing his hands first.  When I approached him about it he became defensive and frustrated as if I was being a jerk. Then they were obstinant when it came to rectifying the situation. I said I didn't want the salad and paid without any sort of apology.

These guys were fast, clean and reasonable.  I'm very glad that I called them when our A/C went out.  He was on another job and didn't know how long it would take, so I told him I would call someone else.  I have someone scheduled, but he called and was able to make it sooner.  He said he'd be there in 20 and he was there in 15.  He replaced a worn out fan and a relay that showed signs of arching.  I will call Flores A/C again the next time we have an issue.  Total turn around time was about 2 hours from my first call to blowing cold.  Thanks!

This place used to be the Indian Fry Bread House. I'm giving it 5 stars based on their pork green chili tacos alone.  The horchata was perfect.  Shrimp and fish tacos were amazing.  Gong back ASAP!

Great newer little place. Perfect for a quick coffee and pastry before or after a hike, bike or walk at Dreamy Draw. The pastries and doughnuts all look amazing. The apple fritter I had was full of fresh apple chunks. Full service coffee bar and fresh brewed coffee. Very close to the 51.
