I have always ordered pizza from dominos and the delivery have been so so. I'll get my food and it'll be okay warm and okay good. That's also might be due to the fact that I always get the same stuff. But TONIGHT I got something different. I got a hot sub, bacon and ranch sub. The delivery was really fast for once but the best part was that the food was super hot. It he food was so hot that u couldn't even touch it. Never have I ever gotten delivery that was super hot.  It was SO good ;-) extremely satisfied with the service and food. Thank you.

Awesome service. I thought at first this place was only for old people...boy was I wrong. Freakin great food, dessert and again service. They are always clean n friendly. I am in love with there turkey sandwich. They make it exactly how I want it . Sounds crazy but sometime restaurants over due the simplest things. All I can say is if you looking for a place to grab something savory this is the place to go. Did I mention the service? Lol

I don't really like auto places because I feel that they're whole job is to make you scared by telling you minor things (that they blow up) about your car, soooooo you can pay more than what you need. With that super long sentence being said... These people are freakin cool. I came here early in the morning because I'm busy and needed a oil change quick. Also the pricing was right. I'm a college student ballin' on a college budget. They only charged me 30 bucks in and out less than a hour and friendly. They weren't mean or pushy. They printed out info I needed for the minor things they can fix on my car and with a quote.No haggling no hidden fees. They were honest and straight forward... And cheap lol. A lot cheaper than most. I had a great experience plus they have free Wi FI

I have NEVER FELT SO DAMN UNCOMFORTABLE IN MY LIFE! I wasn't in there 5 mind before I had someone breathing down my back.  I asked the lady at the front counter where the bonding glue was, she pointed to a very empty low selection shelf In front of the register. Not only did I just come in with a wallet, no purse or bag. But she had some tall a** man stand right behind me ( he's supposed to be there security guard...) Like I'm going to steal somethings. not joking 5 freakin minutes I was in there and I was gone. Hey here's a tip not everyone who's black steals. If you want to keep customers be friendly and have a selection. Ask what are u looking for? Horrible! If I could give negative rating OMG I would. DO NOT COME HERE. I have been to several hair stores and this so happened to be the closest to one of my clients.

Freakin best burgers have ever had. They make everything in front of you, which I absolutely love. Herd about the place from my boyfriend and I am in love! Friendly service, great staff but most importantly great food. Please bring cash before you come here, they do not accept credit or debit card. Kind of noisy but worth it. :-)

I only gave them two stars because they had the game on. Other than that this place is gross! I ordered a simple chicken tortilla soup and it was cold. I also order a glass of wine...UHG not cool. I have to admit the wine was cool but that wine glass was dingy and disgusting-.- the silver ware look like it had been through World War II . The waitress act like she had an attitude if we had a question. Not liking this place. This is the first time and definitely the last. Oh please STAY AWAY FROM THE SHRIMP AVOCADO SALASA... my mother got sick right after she ate it....

I gave it a star because the food I had was okay. The service however was F**kn horrible!!! I will not be returning here. The server like ignored us for 30mins and when she took our order she started coping a attitude. What the hell? I always base a restaurant off their service and there service sucked. Blah I'm super disappointed.

I have gave it one more chance due to my mother LOVING this place. They definitely step up since i came last time.  Maybe they were having a bad day? Idk. Well anyways I like this place so far. They have awesome lunch and happy hour deals and the staff they had serving us was very nice. I really do like the atmosphere of the restaurant. Pretty awesome place with pretty awesome food. TRY THAT MAC N CHESEE!!! :-)

Worst gym ever! I have been going to this gym for almost a year now and haven't had any problems up till now. The gym it self is okay got not being equipped for a lot of major machines. However the customer service at this DUMP is HORRIBLE! I don't know what gave the night shift the right to be so rude to paying customers but it is unacceptable. Attitude problems when u ask for a towel, Rollin of the eyes when you ask for a parking validation. Really now? I should be able to go to the gym to release stress not to get it.   UHG  frustrating especially when the manger never is there. Please don't waste your money here.

I herd about this place form a friend and he told me to check it out. I was a bit skeptical about it because of the location but as soon as I got there I was excited! The restaurant is well layed out and the waiting service is great. I have never eaten Viennese food before so I didn't know what to expect. The food me and my boyfriend ordered was fabulous and at a really decent price. I will definitely recommend this place to someone else.

So... Went here because it was super close to my house, and it had great reviews. Well let me talk about the pros first.  Pros: They have a AWESOME PAINTING OF ITALY! really cool love it. They have great coffee.   Cons: Supper stuffy and hot when I walked in the door. Had to ask to turn on the fan nearby.  I ordered a waffle anything but airy and soft. I was hungry so I ate it.  Was a bit confused on why a cup of fruit was not an alternative for a side. Instead you had to pay extra for it. Not a reasonable extra like 3 dollars extra for like this tiny bowl of fruit. Really disappointed at that because for the amount of money you paid for the food it was very little. Don't mind paying the amount if its worth it.

This place is soooo awesome!!! When I first stepped in it smelled so good. The people where so nice! Shout out to Ryan in the deli!!!! He had all the answers to my weird questions. I learned a lot. The people there are so nice. Everyone greeted me and asked me if I was doing well. Love this place an it's really not expensive if you know what to look for. I will be defiantly be coming back again. I had a great experience and if I could give it more stars I would!

Would give it 5 stars if they weren't lacking in customer service. Every time I go in there no one greets you when you enter. The cashier has no personality and doesn't like to make sure the order was correct. I guess I'll order from online now. Overall tho the pizza is the bomb! I really love how fresh EVEYTHING is. You can see what they are doing and the restaurant  is so clean. Which is a huge plus for me.

I really liked how clean the car wash was. Great prices and they have happy hour everyday between 7-9am which is really cool. The only reason I gave it 4 star is because they offer free vacuums with a purchase of a car wash n the vacuums suction isn't that great. I have a husky dog so I need a really good vac to get all that hair up. Other than that it was a great experience. My car was spectacularly clean so I will be back.

It was okay. The environment was awesome but the food well... Meh. It is definitely a hot dog place because their chili dog was on point. Good place to bring your family to.
