I would have expected a little more from Mandalay Bay. The food was OK (prime rib and crab legs being the 2 leading items), but nothing compared to Bacchanal at Ceaser's. The wait staff made a lot of mistakes. I ordered an iced tea and was brought a pink lemonade. It was about 10 minutes before he came around again so I could ask him to correct it. I told him that I ordered an iced tea, not a lemonade. What does he do? He comes back with another pink lemonade, which I promptly sent back. They were also slow to pick up the dirty plates from the table. I would save your money and pay the extra to eat at Bacchanal at Ceaser's instead of this place.

Always great food and superior service. A little pricey, but you get what you pay for. I love this place.
