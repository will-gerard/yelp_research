Very slow service! Sushi was just average. A little pricey for the food/service/ambiance. Probably my first & last time here.

Just had one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life here.  The server was incredibly rude and the hot pot was disgusting. Find another place!

Great 1st time experience w/ my family! We got a bunch of different dishes & just shared everything. The kimchi here is great. I would say that if you're not familiar w/ Korean food to start by trying the kalbi or bulgogi (beef) with rice or bi bim bap (mixed rice, beef, vegetables w/ a spicy sauce). During happy hour they gave us 'buy 1 get 1 free' beer which was awesome. I'll definitely be back here

Great 1st time experience! Got the tempura shrimp soba noodle (added zucchini) w/ a side of kimchi. Delicious. Fast. Clean atmosphere. We'll def be back for more

The food here is good, but the service is....Uggghh.  Been a few times and am used to slow service or them forgetting to bring items, but today the female server was just rude.  I don't know if she just didn't want to be there or didn't want us to be there...either way it left my table with a bad experience. Too bad.
