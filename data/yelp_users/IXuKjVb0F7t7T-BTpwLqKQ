I've been taking my 6 yr old daughter here for about a yr and a half. She loves coming here each week. She has made some great friendships and she has loved all of the instructors that she has been with. The student really creates a bond with their instructor. When you pay for the services, you really do get top quality.

One of my favorite places to shop at! Their food is amazing and a lot of their stuff you can't find at your local grocery store. They have quality flower bouquets that are cheap. I love how they have little shopping carts so that your children won't be bored and can help you out. I obviously know that if I go on a weekend it will be busier than going on a weekday. It shouldn't be such a surprise since its like that everywhere else you go.

I got my 1st tattoo this past Friday and I really had a great experience. Within the 1st ten minutes I started getting lightheaded and Rob stopped right away. He asked my friend to get me a soda from next door and then Rob made me put my head down, he put a wet paper towel on the back of my neck and just helped me get thru it. He let me take my time but thankfully, once I drank some of the soda I was okay. Rob was very nice and I just fell in love with my tattoo. If I get another tattoo, I will definitely be back!

Best place to eat Korean food.  Their food and service is amazing!  Really friendly staff and the manager always checks to see if everything is going good and if we need anything.

Hate this place!!! I came here under the new management and it was the worst experience of my life. I went to get a pedicure and asked for the callous remover and the owner took too much off. Yes, it was the owner! He kept talking about other nail salons and how his is better and how they focus on the customer experience. I could barely walk for 3 days!! It was so tender and just hurt way too much. I never had this happen to me before and I hope no one ever experiences this. I don't care how good the place may look but if you can't do your job and just worry about your business, maybe you should pick a different profession.

I seriously hate this place because of FOOD POISONING! My co-worker and I decided to pick up some Green Curry w/ chicken for lunch. The lady on the phone was able to persuade me to get the dinner serving for just $2 more. I agreed and when I went to pick up the food I was pretty impressed with how big the containers were because I thought I would be able to save half for dinner. I was very wrong. We barely ate a quarter of it and both of our stomachs started hurting really bad and than later in the day, I threw up. I called Thai Basil after work to let them know and the lady was very rude. She said it couldn't have been their food and it must've been something else that I ate because they just make a big pot for the whole day. I let her know that my co-worker also got sick and she just blew me off. She asked me what I wanted and at that point, I did ask for a refund since she was rude and didn't care. I hate asking for money back but if the customer service isn't there, than I will ask. She said they can only give me half of my refund back and nothing else. I picked up the money the next day and thno one said a single word to me about the situation. They just handed me the money and turned around.

This is only good to go to if you have kids.  Food is overpriced and they sure like to add too much pepper and believe its called flavor.  Only good thing is the atmosphere.

FINALLY made it after living here for 6 years.. really sad.  The pulled pork is to die for!!  My 4 year old daughter is a picky eater but she loved everything!  I can't wait to come back and try their sweet potato pie.

The buffet is amazing and the people are so nice!!!  Don't let one person's opinion of vomit throw you off.  It's just plain rude and distasteful.  My friends and I have been coming here for years and love it!  I finally have some week days off and get to come back.  Now I don't have to take a sick day to come eat at their buffet.  =)

A little too pricey!  I went to get a spray tan cos I had a holiday party to go to and I was desperate.  I paid $36 for a spray tan that lasts for a week.  The only nice thing I have to say about the place is the lady who works there is really nice.

I came for the first time today and I got the  Coconut Crunch (cold). It was really good and the customer service was great. The barista was outgoing and explained any questions we had about their drinks. The atmosphere inside was relaxing and calming. Plus, they have a drive-thru so it's a big plus if you have kids. Now it will be a hard decision between here and Dutch Bros.

I LOVE coming here! The entire staff is beyond friendly and super nice. It's always clean and there are toys, games, books, and a movie that can keep any kid occupied. Plus, they send text messages to remind you of your appointments.

Food is always great but the service was horrible.  We sat outside because the weather was perfect but it took about 10 minutes before anyone came to our table. There was people sitting all around us but we were just ignored. Next time I want Chompie's I will be going to location in Tempe!

Today was the first time that my bf and I decided to eat here. My bf was looking for a place for Father's Day and saw all the food reviews on Yelp. He read that you need to come early and thankfully, we decided to come 20 min early before they opened. The location is in an industrial area, really close to the airport. The parking lot is pretty small so that's another good reason to come early. We were within the first 15 people in line. The line does move a little bit slow but it is worth it!! First off, everyone who works there is incredibly friendly and you could tell that no one minded waiting. We were able to sample some of the brisket and sausage before choosing. Everything is cut right in front of you when you tell the guy what you want. There are a few tables inside and there is a shaded area outside to eat. If you do sit outside they do have misters. You can order the meat by half pound or get a meat plate with a couple of sides. I decided to get the 2 meat plate with the brisket, sausage, coleslaw, and jalape√±o grits. The sausage is a little bit spicy but next time I will just get the brisket. It is to DIE FOR!! They were so juicy, tender and just melted in your mouth. And.. the grits were really yummy! It had the right amount of flavor. I'm usually not a fan of grits but this will be a must every time. My bf also got the ribs and loved it. He said this was the best bbq he has ever had and is already talking about taking his dad. This is definitely a hidden gem!

I was finally able to visit this place after all of my friends have been talking about the location in Vegas. This was my first time and it was pretty good. We ordered a pound of the king crab legs, pound of crawfish and half a pound of shrimp. My bf love the crab and crawfish and the shrimp was cooked to perfection. I got the Hot N Juicy sauce with my shrimp and it was okay, nothing too special but I enjoyed it. We also ordered a side of cajun and sweet potato frieds. OMG, so good! The place was clean and the service was good. It was a little bit of a long wait for the food but I was with family so it didn't matter. They even gave us complimentary calenders for HnJ. Really nice! I will come here again but because I live in Chandler it won't be as often and the parking sucks but that is understandable because it is on Mill Ave.
