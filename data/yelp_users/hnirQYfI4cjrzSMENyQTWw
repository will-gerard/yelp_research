Hmm.. seeing all the reviews on so-called dive bars in Phoenix made me remember Kay's Place -- the diviest of all dive bars I've ever entered. As in, 'wow, I might die tonight.' Seriously. It's next to something that resembles a scrap metal yard. I used to come here with one of my old friends who LOVED dive bars. And she loved Kay's because the drinks were dirt cheap and you could karaoke with people ranging from the drunk homeless man to the guy who fried his brain on too much acid and drooled a little bit as he sang.. I'm not kidding. I finally convinced her to quit coming after we witnessed what looked like a knife fight, spilling out of the doors as we can in one night.  I'm giving it two stars -- one for being there and the second for being, honestly, the most 'authentic' dive bar experience I never want to experience again.

If you haven't been to this place - go! Seriously. It's amazing. It's the best little hole-in-a-rundown-strip-mall you can find. And it's cheap!  Nestled between stores like Big Lots and some electronic place with Mexican ranchero music blasting, this tiny place is hidden in the corner. The owner is from El Salvador, so don't expect it to be Mexican food -- there are many similarities, but the dishes themselves are different. Walking in, you can smell the homemade pupusas -- seriously, it smells like the roadside stands along the bus routes in central America. It's amazing. There are only a couple waitresses, and I don't think they speak much English, but the menu is in pictures, as well as in Spanish and some English, so you should do just fine.  Get the pupusas - they're like thick, hand-made tortillas stuffed with either pork, cheese and beans or, my favorite, cheese and loraco flower, which is some green and edible plant that tastes a bit like asparagus, to me. It's definitely the best one. These things come with salsa and some coleslaw (if they don't, just ask for the salsa) and are very filling! The other dishes are really good, too. For a low price, you can get an entire plate of things like meat with rice and beans - and this place doesn't skimp on the fixin's. They put slices of fresh tomatoes, avocado and all kinds of other stuff on the plates. I honestly LOVE it here. If you want to avoid the crowds, come at an off-hour... then you can just sit, relax and watch the telenovela on the TV in the corner. For dessert, pick up a piece of the cheese pie near the cash register. I can't recommend this place enough!

I love Lee-Lees: now that I'vee been there enough times that I can actually find things. I agree with some previous posters that it's really hard to find some items (like peanuts) due to their "aisle-by-country" organizational system. Hence, one star knocked off. Oh, and the fact that their baggers use enough plastic bags to fill a small landfill every day (Thanks, but I don't need a separate plastic bag just for my yogurt).  Other than that, though, this place is just amazing. You can find practically anything IN THE WORLD here.   And now that I've taken to trying to *surpise* my husband (lucky him, ha ha) by finding all these random recipes from his part of India, and then trying to make them, I've really started to appreciate their selection even more.  Also, the produce is dirt cheap. Lemons are 20 cents - are you kidding? They're at least 60-90 cents everywhere else.  You know how you have to pay like 3 dollars for a little container of fresh mint at Safeway? Well at Lee-Lee's, you can get a whole huge bunch for less than a dollar. Mojito Away!  Among the other great things I've found there: pre-fried tofu, Malaysian frozen parathas, fresh lotus roots, three kinds of eggplant, Guarana soda, anything tamarind, frozen grated coconut, Quilmes beer, any Indian spice imaginable, masaman curry mix, coconut juice, mung bean sprouts, paneer, frozen dhokla, pupusas... and the list goes on.

I had to buy a new laptop last week, and decided to check out Best Buy. I purchased one, only to get home and realize it was missing it's charger. Back to Best Buy. Then, they gave me a charger. I headed home and plugged it in and... nothing. The computer wouldn't work. Back to Best Buy. I purchased a different laptop this time, since I didn't trust the other one. Got home and hated it. It was huge and heavy. Back to Best Buy. So that last one was my own fault. And, after looking at my own clump of receipts, I figured I was going to have trouble getting a refund or getting a different laptop. But I was wrong! Mo, a customer assistant with a great attitude, helped convince the manager to waive the restocking fee and get me the computer I wanted. Even better, I didn't get the super obnoxious hard-sell about the warranties, software upgrades, etc., that I used to get at other Best Buys. They offered them to me, true, but tnone of the salespeople were pushy, which I really appreciated. Long story short, I'm really happy with the purchase I made, and will likely go back to Best Buy if I need to buy another computer.

Nothing too new to add to the reviews of Abuelos... beautiful restaurant with mediocre, watered-down Mexican food.  On the positive side, at least they have several decent vegetarian options. On the negative side, all of those options are loaded with greasy cheese and have very little seasoning. The sangria tastes like fruit juice - ick.  Yet another disappointing Mexican restaurant in Phoenix - then again, I should have known better. It is a huge, corporatized chain outside a shopping mall...

Havana Cafe is a fun little place -- live guitar music, yummy drinks, plastic chairs and fake plants that make me think I could be somewhere in the Caribbean... it's nice! My husband and I went here on Friday night. I hadn't been to a Havana Cafe for a while, although I used to frequent the one in Arcadia.  I got two caipirinhas, which were a little too sweet, but still tasty. Plus, it's not easy to find those drinks in Phoenix, so H.C. gets a star just for that! We had the fried plantains for an appetizer, which were just OK. But my dinner -- the vegetarian "cho cho" -- was great. It's chayote cooked with lentils and veggies and a "Jamaican curry sauce" over rice. Delicious and huge. My husband loved the mixed parrilla he ordered, too. For dessert, we ordered the flan and it was amazing. Definitely the best flan I've had in years. Not too sweet and the perfect consistency, and the caramel sauce that it came with had this great kind of creme-brulee flavor.  Havana Cafe was definitely better than I remembered it being! The only downside is that the service was sort of slow. We didn't mind, because we weren't in any hurry, but I could see where it might be annoying if you had somewhere else to be.

Harkins Shea 14 is my third-favorite movie theater in the Valley (number one, of course, is Camelview 5). I like Shea 14 because of two reasons:  1. While every theater is full of obnoxious pre-teens and teenagers, the ones at this particular theater seem to be less annoying and, well, there are fewer of them than in other places. 2. They actually sometimes show less-mainstream films here after playing them at Camelview 5 for a while. For example? I was able to see Persepolis here over the weekend. Of course, they DO put the foreign or indie films in the tiny little awkward theaters where your neck hurts from looking up at the screen and there are only seats for 25 people. But you know what? I'll take it. It's better than being forced to watch some terrible movie like "Good Luck Chuck" because there are no other movie choices playing...

I finally found a tailor! Yea!!! Fatemeh, the owner, is always here and she is SO nice! I've had several things altered here already, ranging in complexity from the  hemming of a pair of dress pants to the total refitting of a long, complex, embroidered dress skirt from India.  Everything has turned out lovely, and the prices are great, too ($9.50 for a pair of pants is just fine with me). They'll even rush orders, if you need it.  I highly recommend this place. Just don't tell too many other people, or I won't be able to get my same-day alterations :)

UGH. This is one of the worst places I've been to. Ever. I probably would have liked it when I was underage, but that's about it. Yeah, yeah, I get it, it's like three or four different types of "clubs" under one roof. But you know what? They all SUCK.  I came here a few months back for a friend's going-away party. Couldn't wait to get home. Pools of foam, bucking bulls, karoake, a 'hip-hop' floor filled with the crappiest top-40-rap you've ever heard. Wow. I couldn't believe it was possible for a place to suck this bad. And what's with the name, anyway? Who is this Graham?

I can only review Rag Tops for hair-removal, not their hair styling. That being said, this is the place I come for eyebrow threading. My friend introduced me to Rambha, one of  the only people she could find in the Valley who did threading, a few years ago. Since then, I've come consistently. In fact, I've tried to get my eyebrows threaded in other places, like Chicago and LA, when I've visited them, because I knew it would be cheaper than the $12 bucks Rambha charges. But it hurts a lot more, and they never look as nice. Rambha's great. The only star I've taken off is for the fact that her appointment system seems a bit off. Sometimes you end up waiting for an extra 10-15 minutes for a procedure that takes about 5 minutes, so that can be annoying. But regardless of that, I'll definitely be returning to Rag Tops so Rambha can do my eyebrows!

Everyone is right. This airline also sucks. Mostly because every time I fly US Airways I experience:  a) Check-in lines out the door b) Airplanes from the Nixon administration era.

Wow. I forgot that libraries existed.  Until recently, when I wanted to get some travel guides for an upcoming European vacation. Then I thought, hmm... maybe a library would be a good idea. So I visited the Mesa library on my lunch hour and I was amazed at all the great books they have there. Seriously, there were all these brand-new, just-released hardcovers just sitting on tables, waiting for me to pick them up. I remember being a teenager and having to wait MONTHS to get new books. Now, apparently, because either a) no one reads or b) no one uses libraries or c) both, new books are readily available at the library. Well, good news for me. I also think the Mesa library may be a great place to pick up decent books because most of the patrons seem to be really, really old or homeless and possibly illiterate. I'm not trying to be snarky, it's just something that's quite clear from the moment you walk in. Overall, however, this is a very nice, well-stocked library. And you can even keep renewing your books on-line.  Thanks to the Mesa library, I just  may make it to the Yelp book club meeting  this weekend... !

Wow! I never would have known about this place if I hadn't read about it on Yelp, and I'm really glad I did. My coworkers and I have been trying to find a decent place near downtown Mesa to have a drink after work - and we finally found it.  Pulling up to Sun Devil, I was a little worried -- it looks pretty ghetto from the outside, and it's surrounded by the typical Mesa trashy stuff - run down strip malls, etc.  But it's totally a hidden gem! Walk in the store and you smell that "liquor store smell" that always reminds me of pretzels. And walk downstairs and you see this cozy little bar with a few tables, surrounded by rows and rows of wines (you can buy them and drink them there, for a cork fee). A chalkboard shows the list of wines they offer -and they have some great ones! Not pricey, either. The bartender was super-friendly and the clientele was, too -- It was so informal, I felt like I was drinking in my uncle's basement in Milwaukee or something -- if my uncle had really great taste in wine, that is.

I like Rosa's.  Being that I've resigned myself to never again eating the great cheap Mexican food I had in Chicago (or even in Madison), I might have just lowered my standards -- but I think that Rosa's serves inexpensive and tasty food. I know some other reviewers have complained about the atmosphere, but I think the place is cute. Also, our waiters have always been really friendly. The last time I was there, we were served by a guy named Juan and he was the most outgoing, responsive and sweet waiter I've had in a really, really long time. I've only been here for lunch, so I usually have the lunch specials, which are in the $6 range. I feel like I get a pretty good deal, and the service is quick.

The restaurant so nice, they named it... well, you get the idea. I really like China China. Not only because it's fun to say, but also because it's cheap-as-hell and tasty. Not great, not healthy, but tasty in that "I really want cheap, greasy Americanized Chinese food the way I remember eating it in 1985 in suburban Wisconsin" sort of way.  The lunch specials are hard to beat. For $5.25 you can get a cup of pretty tasty soup, an egg roll, wonton and a main dish (fried tofu and veggies for me, but my friend had the kung pao veggies and they were also good).  Again, don't go here for a gourmet experience, but for a cheap Americanized-Chinese food experience.  Other stars are for the setting (clean and with cute little blossom-painted paper lanterns above the booths) and for the very friendly waitstaff.

Well I just got wind that this place is closing, now. Apparently the family is going to call it quits sometime shortly. I've been here a few times with coworkers and I'm not a fan, either. Too cheesy, too flavorless, etc. I think maybe this was the type of "Mexican" food that white Americans liked eating 30 years ago... that's the impression I've had of it, anyhow.

Ick. I rarely ever just throw away my food, but most of my meal from House of Egg roll is now sitting in my trash can.  I ordered sesame tofu, which sounded great. What I got was some hard triangles of tofu coated in about 10 sesame seeds and then dyed bright, glow-in-the-dark orange (which suspiciously looked, and tasted, exactly like the sweet-and-sour sauce that came with our egg rolls). ,  That was it. Nothing else, other than several florets of broccoli they put under the tofu. No, it wasn't cooked with the tofu and sauce, it was just plopped, raw, underneath everything. And there wasn't even really any gravy or sauce at all, so everything was dry.  I want to give H.O.E.G. points for trying to be a bit more creative on the veggie options (Sesame tofu, orange tofu, etc) but if the food sucks, it doesn't really matter how good the menu appears.  My husband's order wasn't much better.  The egg rolls were pretty good, I'll admit.  I should have stuck with Sun Chinese Dining. Sorry, Sun, I won't stray again...

I've been coming to this place for years. It's cheap and yummy. And, located in downtown Scottsdale, that's a rare find. For $5, the falafel sandwich is the best bargain. The falafel is crispy, and the sandwich is rolled up with hummus, tahini and tomato. It comes with a little iceberg lettuce salad that's unremarkable -- except for the tangy dressing (maybe sumac?) that makes it flavorful. The actual falafel here is probably the best in the Valley. It's the only thing I've tasted that comes close to the home-made falafel my friend used to make for us all at bar time....that stuff rocked.  A few tips, though: First, don't bother parking in the parking lot. It's tiny and I've seen cars almost hit each other (or diners) on multiple occasions. Just park on the street. Also, order ahead. The service can be kind of slow, so just go online and order about 10 minutes before you get there. If the weather is nice, it's a great place to eat outdoors.

Why do people like this place? Why is it always packed?  I came here over the weekend to grab a drink in between rounds of afternoon shopping.  My friend and I wanted a quick glass of wine (yes, I know, this isn't the place to go for great wine. But I thought we could quickly grab something decent). Let me start off by saying I tried to totally different wines that tasted exactly the same -- sour and rotten. Then we wanted an appetizer. SO I got California Rolls. Now, I know that's kind of lame, for people who are into sushi. I'm not into sushi. Our waitress actually ROLLED HER EYES when I ordered it. Kona Grill, come off it! You're like the Olive Garden of Sushi, and you're judging ME for ordering California rolls??? Then they weren't even very good. And my stomach was upset for about four hours after I ate it. And our waitress took about 30 minutes to bring us our check. And our table was sticky and smelled of beer. Ick.  Never coming back.

I know, I know... why the hell review Kazimierz? Hasn't everyone reviewed it already? Yes.. but I can't help it. It's sentimental. I've had some of my *best* dates here. And it's where I met my husband! So deal with it, people.  Love the atmosphere. Even when you walk in, it smells like tannins (or is that dirty leather? Well, whatever). It always feels dark and earthy and romantic. I always get the fondue, which is pretty good.   The best time to go here is NOT on the weekend nights. Sundays, Thursdays, any other days, they will often have live jazz or blues. Tonight I got to hear jazzy Christmas music, which was great. The weekends, however, can be lame, as they charge you for... absolutely nothing, other than walking in the door.  Why not five stars? Well, the long line for the bathrooms. AND the fact that, in spite of being a wine bar, many of the wines aren't that good. I was all excited to try one of the flights they have with Armenian and Lebanese wines. But they weren't actually that good. Some of the other wines I've tasted have just been mediocre. One exception? The zinfandel I had tonight. Something from Mortenson "dry creek." Can't remember the actual name of it because, well, I had too many glasses of it...but it was delicious! Spicy and warm and with a finish that reminded me of... marshmallows? I know that description won't make it into Wine Spectator or anything, but honestly, it was awesome!

When I got married a few months ago, I decided at the last minute that I didn't want to do my own makeup. I called a few places, which were all booked, and then came across Salon . They had an opening with a guy named Jonathan. I took it and I'm SO glad I did. He was really friendly, right on time and did amazing things with my eyes. Best of all, I was in and out in 45 minutes.  I have a friend who cuts my hair and I can't see myself ever getting pro makeup done again. So I probably won't be back. But I'd definitely recommend Jonathan to anyone!

So I don't really see much of a point in reviewing tons of chain restaurants -- so, in general, I don't. Unless the place is either so much better -- or so much worse-- than its counterparts, that it needs to be noted. Unfortunately for this Schlotzsky's, it's the latter. I came here today for a quick lunch, because my husband had a craving for it. I'm used to this place because a) I used to work at a S.Deli in high school and b) there's one near my office, so I eat there a couple times a month.  This Schlotzsky's, however, totally screwed things up. From the lack of a bathroom to the surly cashier to my sandwich -- which was, honestly, missing two of its key ingredients, the entire lunch was a disappointment.  Even worse? My husbands pizza. Apparently, they ran out of pizza crusts. Because it came out on a SANDWICH BUN. A large bun, mind you, but STILL! Isn't that the sort of thing someone would warn you about when you order?  "Oh, by the way, we're out of pizza crusts, so we can still make a pizza for you, but it will be on regular sourdough bread." Nope. Nothing. I'm definitely not bothering to come back here. Not when there's a Nellos and a  great falafel place so nearby.

Do you like looking out your window to see homeless people picking through your dumpsters? Do you like it when those people, apparently unhappy with your trash, then light your dumpster on fire? Do you think it's so much more fun to do laundry when it takes 3 hours for your dryer to do its job? Do evenings at home seem so empty to you, without barking dogs,  screaming NASCAR-loving neighbors and floors that shake from running children next door? Would you like to feel like you live off 19th and Buckeye, but have a posh Scottsdale mailing address, too? Do unresponsive front office workers turn you on? Does life seem mundane unless your car gets broken into in your "gated" community's parking lot? Do you like that smell of cigarette smoke that wafts into your apartment from the smelly smokers below you?  If so, you should most definitely check this place out. You'll LOVE IT!

Marshall's is the only place I've ever really trusted to tell me what's going on with my car, and not screw me over. I've used them for three years, and, until recently, I had a really beat-up, crappy car. It needed TONS of repairs, but they were always really nice about telling me which things needed to be fixed for my safety, and which things could wait. They actually tried to save me money.. amazing. One time, my muffler was starting fall off. I told them my budget for repairs, and instead of trying to cheat me out of as much money as possible, they actually wound some wire around the muffler, free of charge, to keep it going. They also superglued something in my windshield wiper for me, once, to keep it going (saying, of course, that they couldn't promise me it would stay, but they wanted to try to save me hundreds of dollars...guess what? It stayed for over a year). These guys are amazing, and they really know what they're doing. And, unlike some other mechanics I've been to, they are really professional and polite.  Even better? I read an old newspaper article about the guy who owns this place. He actually saved someone's life when he was hiking in the Grand Canyon years ago, carrying an unconscious hiker up halfway until rescue crews could get her. That's how much you can trust him :)

It's close. It's cheap enough. It's a few feet from Scratch Bakery.  All these are great reasons to try Chaparral Cleaners and Laundry. I've been to a few dry cleaners where they "can't" get stains out of the clothes, and won't even try -- WTF???  Chaparral has never had any problems getting the huge coffee stains out of my white and khaki pants -- yes, I'm a clutz -- and they also haven't melted any of the beadwork on some of the other tops I've brought inhere -- and for that, I salute them.

Yum! I LOVE Grimaldi's. Whenever I want pizza, I'm always stuck in a mental debate over Grimaldis vs. Nellos, since they're across the street from one another. But when I want traditional pizza (whatever I mean by that.. I guess I mean non-funky toppings!, just typical topping like olives or garlic) I choose Grimaldis.  Love the mozzarella they put on their pizza and I love the basil and the fact that they're light on the tomato sauce. Good drink menu, too, and hostesses are always friendly!

If you haven't tried Persian food YOU MUST COME HERE. This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley, and I always take out-of-town guests here (and they always love it).   No offense to Brian, but I don't really think it's fair to compare Persian Room to Indian food  (although I agree Tandoori Times is great for Indian cuisine). Persian food has very different flavors and its even very different from food in Arab countries. I love their stews, some of which have dried black lemons in them, which give a great, earthy, sour flavor.   Try the rice with the barberries -- it's really good. Although, if you go with a group, make sure to get their appetizer platter. They hummus and eggplant mixture is AMAZING, as is their fresh bread which they serve with butter and fresh mint.  If you're adventurous, try the chicken fessenjaan, which is made with a pomegranate walnut sauce -- it's a very unique flavor.  As a side note, Persian Room catered my wedding this past fall. It was such a bargain, compared with other caterers, and the food was absolutely delicious, from the beef to the chicken to the veggie stew and salad. Everyone loved it.

Antique Trove is one of the best places to dig for antiques in the Valley. Whenever I have an afternoon with nothing to do, I come here. I've found an awesome selection of 100-year-old postcards, an end table, an old tapestry, old shoes and some nice plates all here at Antique Trove. Unlike some other places that claim to have "antiques," this place actually has mostly things that are at least 50-years old -- not just shelves and shelves of crap like Smurf collectibles or Precious Moments figurines...thank God...

My husband and I came to Lalibela's for Valentine' Day and it was the perfect dinner. Every time we eat at Lalibela, we keep wondering why we don't make the short drive there more often.  Tonight, we tried one of the Ethiopian wines, a sweet red called Axumit. It was nice -- I think they might even sell bottles of it to take home,although I'm not positive. I love all the vegetarian dishes here, especially the Shiro Wat, which is ground peas with berbere and onion. Also, I always try to order their home-made crumbly white cheese to add to the dishes -- they're often out of it, because it takes a long time to make, but it's delicious if you can get some. The tiramisu and the coffee is also very good, as well as the Koranti, which is hot tea with some ouzo in it.  Overall, this place is just fabulous. I've had Ethiopian food in places like San Francisco and D.C., and Lalibela's has come out on top every time. The crowd is pretty nice, too. Lots of people from varied backgrounds frequent the restaurant, as well as what I think of as the NPR crowd -- you know, the ones with glasses and funky jewelry who have loud, obscure conversations about astrophysics or medieval Bosnian literature or the deplorable state of the world's organic strawberry farms... that could be because Cafe Lalibela is a sponsor on KJZZ, though, which actually was the reason I sought it out when I first moved to Phoenix. Just another reason to support this place!

KJZZ, Yesterday, due to a malfunction, you were off the air for about 20 minutes of my morning. I moved SO slowly, trying to get ready for work! And I realized how much I depend on you to make my mornings not suck.  I especially love your international reports with National Geographic, and I've even grown to like the "This I Believe" segments. The only thing I don't like is Car Talk. Oh well. You could make up for it by maybe adding more David Sedaris to your mornings???? Overall, you let me learn something new every day. And I love you for it.

Wow -- finally, I've found a coffee shop in Scottsdale with more than 4 tables. Seriously.I haven't been able to find anyplace within a half-hour of my apartment that has:  1. Enough tables 2. Decent-ish coffee 3. An absence of blasting rock music  And now I found this place. Even better? Free Internet access. Why don't more place in this town have it? So, yeah, I know CP is a chain. I know the coffee isn't fabulous. I know it's in a strip mall. Sure, compared to coffeehouses in college towns, it would suck. But, for Scottsdale, it wasn't bad!  And the cappuccinos were pretty good. Also, I know other posters have complained about a loud, high-school crowd here. But, at least on a Sunday, I didn't experience that.

This is honestly one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in -- worse than that ant-infested Holiday Inn in Wyoming. Worse, even, than the dirtiest youth hostel I visited in Mexico. Why? Because it's overpriced and disgustingly pretentious. The worst part about this joint was the lobby, which reminds me of what might happen if  Salvador Dali met Christina Aguilera in 'Moulin Rouge.' And then they had a love child.   I get the idea of a hip boutique hotel. But this is just some crappy 1960s motel that they painted black and white and furnished with shitty IKEA-esque furniture. Really.  It reminded me of  some "design on a dime" example on HGTV. "For just $40 and a bit of black paint, we transformed this aging motel into a hip destination!!!" Except that they didn't. The rooms are tiny, the bed was horribly uncomfortable and even the bathroom was...well...odd. They didn't even have a coffee maker! And the huge flat screen TV was too big for the room, so we couldn't even watch it properly.  I'm also convinced the front desk worker was faking some vague European accent, too, but I can't prove it.

Camelback is easily one of my favorite places in Phoenix. I'd highly suggest going RIGHT NOW, because when my husband and I hiked the Echo Canyon trail on Saturday it was gorgeous! All the rain has turned the mountain green -- well, as green as it will turn. It is still a desert, after all. Anyway, there is grass and weeds and wildflowers and moss all over- it's like a new mountain!  The one thing I don't get about Camelback, however, is how EVERY time I do it, no matter how many times I've done it before, my legs still ache like hell the next day. Oh well.  In addition to the great workout, hiking the mountain exposes you to a great slice o'life. I've seen it all here -- flabby men hiking in speedos, little chihuahuas that ascend this thing faster than I do, helicopter rescues, girlfriends nearly breaking up with their boyfriends because they don't want to go all the way to the top, and people from all over the country, and the world, who make sure to hike the mountain while they're in Phoenix. Very cool.   There is one minor annoyance I have with this place -- and that's the people who hike the entire thing, up and down, at a regular pace... then run the last 5 minutes like a bat out of hell. You're not fooling anyone, toolboxes, we all know you didn't run the whole thing. Quit pretending, and quit knocking me off the trail!

Cool: Funky retro furniture that looks like it could be  from the 60s. Not cool: Furniture that is so dirty it actually LOOKS like it's from the 60s and has been sitting in my parent's basement for two decades. Cafe Zuzu -- clean your freaking booths.  The first thing I noticed after sitting down here this morning was that the brown polyester upholstery on my chair was stained with -- milk? And then, looking around,  I noticed the walls of many of the booths (same fabric) were also stained. The carpets were full of crumbs and food, too. That's what I expect from I-Hop, not the Valley Ho.  My husband and I ate here for Easter brunch, but were overall disappointed. The menu? boring. The prices? OK, but a bit high for what you're getting. The service? Slow. The decor? Very cool. I'll admit, I enjoyed sitting in the cafe with glass walls that were open to the pool and the cool decorations. But that was about it. The menu was all things like "Denver omelet" "bacon and mushroom omelet" "scrambled eggs with grits" "pancakes" -- what is this, a breakfast join in Fargo or something? Really, that's the best you can do?  I really wanted french toast, but the only option Zuzu offered was "cranberry and walnut" - which seemed a little seasonal. As in, NOT the springtime season. So I settled for the eggs and grits. The grits were really good. The eggs were... well... scrambled eggs. They were fine, and all, pretty tasty -- but that's it.  I guess I just expected something more.  I was under the impression that this place was supposed to put a  "twist" on the typical "comfort foods" -- but they seemed to forget to add the twist. I could have had a far more creative brunch at home.

Five stars to Pita Jungle for being one of the handful of places that my mom, dad, husband  all enjoy. Oh, and I love it.  After about 2 hours of deliberations last night we decided to head over to the Scottsdale location. Bad news was that it was a 25 minute wait. The wait was made even worse by the fact that I'm quite sure the hostess accidentally skipped over us at least once. But once we sat down we forgot all about it. The parents had the salmon ($13), my husband had the seafood provencal and I had the med platter (it's the first time i"ve gotten anything other than the lentil fattoush salad, which is one of my all-time favorite meals). We all all got the cup of red lentil Turkish soup which was fabulous! Everyone was happy and full at the end of the meal and my dad was even excited about how cheap everything was.. thank you Pita Jungle.

I LOVE Camelview for the fact that it attracts much more of the NPR-loving, Fanny-pack toting, middle-age set than the teenagers. It's nice to go to a cinema and not be interrupted by the bright blue lights of a text messaging phone...  That being said, the place could circulate its movies a bit more. Sometimes I feel like they keep the same boring French film on rotation for a few weeks more than necessary. But if you're looking for a place to find a unique movie, this is definitely it. Also, they host a few film festivals throughout the year. About a month ago, my husband and I saw an Iranian film , a French film and a British film as part of the Scottsdale Film Fest and they were all great.  Really, I don't know what we would do without this place! Go! Support decent local cinemas!!!!

Let's put it this way -- Ticoz was so awesome that I am completely willing to come back for numerous happy hours -- even though I work about 40 minutes away, and gas is $3.75 a gallon.  Cool atmosphere, unusually friendly and down-to-earth staff, quiet enough for a great conversation, plenty of parking, and lychee mojitos.  What else can I say?

It's probably not worth reviewing Changing Hands, since everyone else already has... but I can't help myself.  As far as the selection -- well, I've seen better at other indie bookstores. BUT most of those bookstores don't carry new AND USED books. And that, in my opinion, is what makes Changing Hands rock.  And, unlike a lot of other used bookstores, Changing Hands actually buys books back at fair prices -- and sells their used book inventory at low prices, too. The last time I came here, I brought three huge boxes of books. I expected the workers to get really annoying with me for bringing in so much - but they were nothing but polite. And, even better, I got a $98 store credit! I was definitely not expecting that!  I also love the staff's choices of books. There are always some great finds in there.

I had high hopes for Tradiciones, so my husband I paid it a visit for lunch on a Sunday, on our way to grab some groceries at Ranch Market. First off, after reading some other reviews, I was worried about getting a cold shoulder from the waitstaff -- but nothing could have been further from the truth. Everyone was really nice and the service was great. The mariachi music was awesome, although I'm glad they didn't come over and try to convince us to get a serenade -- I hate that. It makes me uncomfortable...anyhow, the chips and salsa were top-notch. But the meals were just OK. My spinach and mushroom enchiladas had a good green sauce, and I was pleasantly surprised to see they weren't stuffed full of copious amounts of crappy cheddar cheese. Instead they just had *some* white cheese, which was nice. My husband ordered some chicken dish that came with a stew (sorry, can't remember the name). He liked it. We each had a margarita, as I wanted to try the cilantro margarita, but I wasn't too impressed. Granted, for $7, it really packed a punch, but the flavor wasn't too spectacular. Overall, I'd say the atmosphere adds another star to what I would consider a 3-star meal. I'd definitely bring out-of-town guests here, as it's a fun place with decent Mexican food in a town where (sorry, everyone) I find it VERY difficult to find decent, reasonable Mexican cuisine.

I can't believe more people don't know about Vincitorio's -- it's easily  the best Italian restaurant in the Valley. The great food, combined with a cool atmosphere (a lot of people are regulars who the bartenders and owners know by name) earns it five stars from me.  My husband and I found this restaurant by accident as we had some time to kill before watching a movie in the adjacent, slightly-ghetto Tempe Pollack Cinemas. We just grabbed some wine and an appetizer, but after looking at the menu, we had to come back.  That was a year ago, and this place has never disappointed us since. It's a small, cozy place with a guitar-playing singer on weekend nights. Also, one of the waiters is an opera singer and he will occasionally belt out  a quick song, a Capella, in the middle of the restaurant.  When my husband and I came here Friday night, we started off with an appetizer of asparagus (cooked perfectly) with prosciutto. Then I had the eggplant parmigiana (I'm sure it's terribly fattening, but was delicious) and he had some special with seafood and a spicy marinara sauce. He said it was delicious. We finished with a huge piece of their tiramisu, which is heavenly and surprisingly light (for tiramisu, that is...).  The only thing that 'could' be a downside to this restaurant is that it's small and tight, so sometimes, even if you make reservations, you might have to wait around for 15 minutes. It's gotten even busier since Phoenix Magazine ran a feature on it, too, last year. That's not an issue for us -- just give yourself some extra time if you are in a hurry.   When we came here for Valentine's Day last year, they were running quite behind -- but the owners gave everyone who was waiting a complimentary glass of champagne, which I thought was really a nice touch.  Oh, and if you get a chance to try their butternut squash ravioli, go for it...it's great, too.

I've waited to review Little India for SO long... mostly because I'm not sure exactly what to write to do it justice. First and foremost, this is an Indian grocery store. But, behind all its masalas and rice flakes, Little India has a family-operated snack business going on. Six or seven little tables in the back are there for people to order and eat their chaat, which is basically Indian street food. The first time came here, I expected typical Indian-restaurant fare. Don't. This is completely different. The list you can order from is small snacks, most of which include fried snack pieces, chutneys and yogurt. It's exactly what you will get if you find street snacks on the beaches in India. And it's delicious. It's not healthy, or light, but it's yummy.  I have friends from other cities, like Miami, who say they can't find anything like this in their cities. So Phoenix, consider yourself lucky!  And go to Little India. Order their samosa chaat (a smooshed samosa with sauces and spices) and a bada pav ( a spicy, spicy "veggie burger" made of potato and spices in between a bun, spread with chutney) and some parathas (handmade Indian 'tortillas,' stuffed with things like radish, or potato or fenugreek).  And it's cheap!

Five stars for Cornish Pasty -- for being something a little different, for having tasty food AND for having about a dozen choices for us vegetarians. I LOVE that this place offers their pasties with Quorn (fake chicken). I've had both the Veggie Rosemary Chicken and the Veggie Tikka Masala with it and they are both awesome. Yes, it's loud, sometimes it's dirty and sometimes the service is slow -- but I'll gladly put up with that for a taste of their pasties. Also, Cornish Pasty is a great place to take out-of-towners -- they love it!

For a great, slightly greasy American breakfast, there's nothing better than US Egg.  Sure,the tables are sometimes sticky, the menu (and the mural of America) is a little ,and there's often a short wait to get a table. But the food (especially the Jack and Avocado omelet - yum!) is great, the prices are reasonable, and the servers are always friendly. And even though there is often a line, they never rush you to finish your coffee. Also, the Scottsdale US Egg is a great people-watching venue. Whether you're an ASU student grabbing a post-church bite to eat with your parents, or a gal out with your friends after a Camelback hike, or a slightly hungover woman wearing last night's halter top, sitting across from a some guy  you met last night-- and you can't quite remember his name -- US Egg will hit the spot.

I used to come here all the time in the morning. That was back when I first moved to Arizona and didn't realize that this was just a California chain... I thought it was something new and different. Then I decided to switch from frothy lattes and other mixed coffee drinks to Just Plain Coffee. And I realized that someone in the back kept seriously messing up the coffee. I don't know what it was, burnt or weak or old or something. So I mostly quit coming. Once in a while I'll still drop in, but they do this thing which really annoys me -- when you ask for room for cream they leave like half the cup empty. I've had times before where my non-observant husband will get coffee for me, bring it home and it's honestly one-third empty because they left "room for cream." NO ONE uses THAT much cream, coffee bean, come on!

At last, I've found a Thai restaurant as good as those I remember from my old college town! Benjarong ROCKS.  I came here with several coworkers for lunch, and we all ordered from the lunch special, which was $6.95 for a main dish and rice, a cup of lemongrass soup, a really good egg roll and two Thai wontons. Delicious. The only thing that disappointed was that the soup had meat in it -- and I'm a vegetarian. They didn't have a veggie choice.  For my curry, I chose a green curry which came with pieces of fried tofu, crisp green beans, carrots, onions, bamboo and LOTS of basil. The green sauce it was swimming in was delicious. The quantity was huge, and we all took leftovers home.  In perusing their full menu online, I noted that they have a lot of dishes not commonly found on Thai menus, from many different regions of Thailand. And they even offer a vegetarian version of massaman curry, which I haven't found elsewhere in the Valley.  You can even order an entire fish, cooked Thai-style, if you want.  I can't wait to come back here and try more of their choices.   The one star deduction comes from the confusion at the time of payment. My friend gave her card, and the waitress (who was very friendly) came back and said it was declined. When my friend got back to work, she noticed that the money was deducted from her bank account anyway. The same friend said she had trouble with a credit card last time, too. Maybe it's just best to pay cash here?  NOTE: After returning to Benjarong about a dozen times, the credit cards problems have disappeared, so I'm adding a fifth star...

Nello's is one of my favorite to go for drinks and appetizers after work. I just went again, tonight, and remembered how much I love it. The setting is nice, the bartender is awesome, the food is good and the wine list is pretty good, too. My coworkers and I generally head to the Tempe Nello's for happy hour, simply because it's the only place we've found between all of our apartments. But the ambiance there is much more "kid-friendly, chucky-cheese." The Scottsdale Nello's has live jazz and mood lighting.. much cooler. I like the eggplant bruschetta as an appetizer, as well as the tortellini salad. My three girlfriends and I always split one of each, and the sizes are perfect for four of us...

Maybe it's odd to yelp about grocery stores, I don't know. But yesterday I realized that grocery stores all have personalities of their own. Trader Joes, for example, is that annoyingly perfect friend you have from Boulder. She hikes, climbs, is well-traveled,  and life is a bit predictable -- she's the person who always has "one glass of red wine," out at dinner and claims that makes her tipsy.  Basha's, on the other hand, is that annoying ex you had in college. He had major flaws and totally used you, but you kept forgetting that at bar time and always ended up with him at least once a week. The next day, you were so pissed off, you vowed to never do it again. But you did.  I always end up going to Basha's because it's really, really close by and convenient. And everytime I get mad at myself. Yesterday I was getting ready to throw a big holiday party and I needed to pick up some random stuff before I started cooking in the morning. Pomegranates? They don't have them. Baguettes? They didn't have them. The friendly guy in the bakery dept. did try his best to find them for me, and he brought me something that sort of looked like a baguette. But it was rock hard. At 9:30 in the morning.  Then I looked, in vain, for sweetened condensed milk, for 15 minutes. Finally found someone to ask. They informed me its in the BREAD AISLE.  Oh, of course, why didn't I think to look there? And their eggplants were $1.50 each! Basha's, why do you keep taking advantage of me?  (To be fair, I'm giving them an extra star because they're the only store where I can find 9X14inch phyllo dough packages).  In the end, I wasted about 40 minutes wandering around, and then I had to go to Safeway, anyway, to get everything I needed. Why do I need to go to all these different stores to buy very basic food items? How annoying!  My grocery bill was wayyyy higher than it needed to be because everything at Basha's seems to be about 70 cents higher than everywhere else. And they don't even have one of those purified water machines outside their store like *every other grocery store has.*  Will I be back? Probably. I can't help it.

Are these supposed to be cupcakes, or freestanding globs of frosting and...sprinkles?  I've never gone into Sprinkles, but my coworkers have brought their cupcakes in on several occasions, so I feel like its fair to review their treats.  And I'm not impressed. The cupcake part is so flimsy and weak, it practically toppled over from the four inches of frosting on top of it, each time I've picked one up. The cake tastes -- really boring. No flavor, other than some sort of weird preservative-like taste (is this from the grocery store bakery? No? Then why does it taste like it is?). I've tasted a vanilla and a chocolate and they both tasted like that. The frosting is yummy, but I ended up throwing away most of it. The worst part about these cupcakes is that, after eating them, both times, I've had a major, major blood sugar crash about two hours afterward. WTF? That doesn't happen when I eat other sweets... just how much sugar is in these things?

This is my second-favorite theater in Phoenix, after Camelview 5. Why? It's clean, close by and generally NOT as stuffed with annoying middle schoolers as the other cinemas (it could be that they have a stricter curfew, much like the one in place at Desert Ridge).  On the other hand, it could be that once this place is around a little longer, it will become annoying crowded and I'll find myself having to come to movies 90 minutes before showtime just to get a seat  -- I hope not.  Tonight, my husband and I came to Tempe Marketplace to see a Pakistani movie. I'm hoping maybe this theater is moving to occasionally show foreign films -- that would be so awesome, as Camelview 5 is the only other place I know to see them. Unfortunately, I'm a dumb ass and I failed to note that the movie didn't have subtitles. Oh, and I don't speak Urdu. When I asked, someone at the theater informed me that it didn't have subtitles and even offered to refund my money - which shocked me.  But I stuck it out, with a combination of my  "Rosetta Stone lesson 6 Hindi" and by annoying my husband with questions every three minutes. All in all, still a fun experience. Oh, and the bathrooms are always spotless at this cinema. That's worth at least an extra star!

Seriously, Yelp?    I finally find a place that I really like in downtown Phoenix, only to read that everyone's been ragging on it? WTF?  I came to Switch tonight to meet a friend who I hadn't seen in.. oh... 15 years? I was so excited to see the nice atmosphere -- much more a lounge, than  bar -- and that's something that's missing in the Valley. The place was cute, the music was the right level and the drink menu was great.  After a caipirinha (ok, well, it really tasted more like a mojito to me, but, whatever - it packed a punch!) and a nice malbec, I can say I truly enjoyed this place. It was a great space to sit comfortably and have a good conversation. The only downside was that the service was slllloooww -- but it was also very friendly, so that wouldn't stop me from recommending this place to anyone. My only surpise was to see that Switch is a breakfast and lunch joint? That struck me as odd, as I'd much rather come here for some nighttime drinks than for a breakfast. But, to each her own....

While I still haven't found a cheap Mexican place that compares to those in Chicago, or, say... Mexico, Mango's is a nice place to come for a burrito. And their aguas frescas are really amazing (my favorite is the canteloupe). The enchiladas are pretty typical -- lots and lots of cheese, rice and beans. But the thing that really stands out here are the burritos 'enchilada style.' The basically take the burrito and smother it in sauce and some cheese. It's delicious! I came here yesterday with a coworker and bought the veggie burrito ($4.75) enchilada-style (extra $1.75). It was tasty and fresh-- full of crumbly white cheese, chunks of avocado, onion, rice, beans and fresh jalepenos.   Antoher thing I like about this place is that, if you come during lunchtime, you'll actually feel like you're in a "real" city - the tables are crowded, both insdie and outside the buildling, it's loud, there's a mix of business people and families - It's unusual for Mesa, and its really nice.

United is officially the WORST airline ever and I have vowed to never fly them so long as I live. Never. Ever. Their ticket counter people? Horrible.  The last time I flew United was with my husband (then fiance). We were going to India. For our wedding. In several days. The ticket counter woman wouldn't let him on the airplane because she said he didn't have a proper visa for flying through Frankfurt. He didn't need one. He told her, and proceeded to pull out a letter from the German Consulate in LA which stated "You don't need a visa to fly through here to India." She replied: "I don't care WHO you got a letter from, I'm not lettin' you on the plane!"  Twenty minutes later, we convinced her to let him fly to Chicago, our layover, where he would recheck-in for our connection on Lufthansa. She yelled "They'll just tell you what I"m telling you!"  They didn't. She was wrong. But thanks to her antics, he got a seat assignment far away from me and we had to sit separately on the 10 hour flight.   When I wrote to United to complain (informing them that if she had succeeded in not letting him on the plane we would have MISSED OUR WEDDING) I never heard back from them. Ever. Nothing. No email, not apology, nothing. Which is why I am never flying their shitty planes ever again.

Let me start off by saying I really don't like seafood... so I'm not very qualified to review this place. However, my friend invited some of us to stop by here Friday to celebrate her just-received and hard-earned master's degree from ASU. So I went. We ate in the oyster bar area. The place is really cute. Sure, it looks kind of corporate, but in a nice way. It's definitely the kind of place I would want to stop by for drinks with my friends. The wine list was OK, and they had some nice sake and martinis. Our waitress was great and really friendly.  The seafood platter they ordered smelled good.. and everyone who ate it said it was tasty. It's definitely a bit pricey, but if the seafood is really that fresh, I guess it's worth it.  I'll probably bring my parents here when they visit and then I'll try something off the menu. The choices (aside from the sushi and seafood platters) range from pricey things like $20+  for the trout or the macadamia-nut crusted halibut to $12 tuna melts.  In the meantime, I have a good opinion of this place. Oh, and it's actually in the parking lot area of Tempe Marketplace, not in that annoying pedestrian part dubbed "The District." So that earns it some points, too.

So I can only review one item at Qdoba, because there's only one item I've eaten there since my freshman year of college in Madison... vegetarian nachos. I love them.  Which is why I was so glad to find out a Qdoba was opening up in Tempe. I'd tried the one in Central Phoenix once in a while, but it was really too far for me to drive to get nachos.  I'm not really a fan of other fast food Mexican food unless I'm really drunk. But Qdoba is different. Because of those fabulous nachos. Black beans, wonderfully flavorful cheese sauce, cheese, corn salsa and a side of guacamole... mmmm..... love it, love it, love it.   On lunch trips with coworkers, my friends don't seem to be as impressed as I have been. But I don't care. I'll go alone.

Cien Agaves is a great addition to downtown Scottsdale -- and it provides a fun, relaxed atmosphere into the mix of places that either seem to be a) dive-y and dumpy or b) snotty and superficial. Cien Agaves has a cool, open building and has some neat art hanging on the walls.  The margaritas I had here were head and shoulders above the ones I've had at nearly every other Valley establishment (especially at places like Dos Gringos or Salty Senorita).  I came here after work with friends and we ordered a house margarita for $4 (happy hour special). It had a lot of ice in it, but tasted really fresh and packed a punch. Then I tried one of their more expensive prickly pear margaritas -- yum! Delicious, without being cloyingly sweet. We didn't get any food, but the chips were great and the two salsas included a pico de gallo and a really amazing green salsa that included tomatillos and, I think, cumin. Great!  The only downside was the service. Our waiter was really nice, but the poor guy seemed completely overworked -- I think they only had one waiter for the entire restaurant and patio. If they hired another one or two servers, the experience would be more enjoyable AND they'd probably move a lot more margaritas! But I definitely plan on coming back here and seeing if maybe that aspect was just an off-night for them.  Try the patio if you can -- it's lovely and it gets you away from the rather loud music that could be playing inside.

Love it, love it, love it.  My husband took me here for my birthday dinner, as we'd been wanting to try this place since it opened. I haven't had the opportunity to eat Afghani food since college, and so I was really excited.  Kabab Palace didn't disappoint.  First, it's adorable, decorated with blue walls, chandeliers and Afghan art. Secondly, they offered a vegetarian section in their menu (it's always nice when they do that, as it shows me the veg food is more than just an afterthought). We ordered the vegetarian ashauk for an appetizer, which was thin "dumplings" stuffed with leeks and covered in veggies and yogurt. It was tasty.  I then ordered a vegetable special, which was amazing! Stewed spinach with a hint of cinnamon, crispy roasted eggplant with yogurt and tomato, an okra sample and sugar-coated pumpkin roasted and topped with yogurt -- all of it came with a rice pulao.  By the way, that eggplant was possibly the best eggplant I've had in my entire life. My husband ordered the sheekh kebab and said it was very good, too. For dessert, we ordered turkish coffee, which was just OK, but it came in adorable china cups and saucers. They also served tea, beer and wine, as well as various juices. The service was very attentive, and the owner was friendly. The restaurant was almost empty around 8 p.m., but I hope business picks up -- I know we'll definitely be back for the high-quality and unique food.

A good sign when you walk into a Thai restaurant? A pair of monks in bright saffron robes.  At least, that's what I figured -- and I wasn't disappointed.  Palee's is in the location of the old "Thai Hut." Those owners moved their restaurant, so the place is now under different management.  For the lunch special, you get an eggroll, a cup of soup and a meal with rice. The soup wasn't very tasty -- it had this thick tree-like stuff in it which I assumed was bamboo, but which didn't really taste like bamboo. Anyhow, the rest of the food was fabulous, and it was cheap. I'll definitely be back.

This place blows. Seriously blows.   I know, I shouldn't expect much at IHOP. But I normally like it for cheap, greasy, fattening breakfasts, especially if I'm hungover.  Not anymore.  I went last month and, as always, ordered the migas. The eggs came, with about a pathetic three or four tortilla strips in a soup of egg, tomato and grease. All covered with an inch of USDA Grade D processed cheese. I scraped the cheese off. But that didn't solve the problem of the inch of grease on the plate. I ate about four bites.  I told the waitress that it was inedible, but she wasn't helpful. Then when I paid, the guy asked how everything was. I told him, and he grunted. Still had to pay for it, though. Why do they ask if they don't care?  IHOP, I'm done with you.

I love winter in Phoenix. The cold, the rain, the clouds -- I LOVE CLOUDY DAYS.  I don't like what winter brings with it, though -- Uggs. Seriously, girls, you looking fucking ridiculous. It's 55 outside and you're wearing huge furry boots. If you tried that shit somewhere up north when it was 55 degrees, you'd get laughed out of town.  I get it. You think they look cool and you're dying to wear them. But you know what? You live in Arizona. You don't get to wear huge, fuzzy boots. Get over it.

My husband and I came here Friday night as part of our "phoenix tour of wine bars." Too bad the "tour" only lasted for two places... oh well. We were supposed to just have one drink at Bomberos and move on, but I thought the place was so cute, I made us stay longer. First of all, I agree with some other posters that the food isn't anything to write home about. We had some bruschetta and it was just OK. Pretty much tasted like something I'd make at home -- not bad, but not earth-shattering. Also, they could expand their menu a bit.  That being said, I really liked the feel of this place -- not pretentious at all, and yet cool. The outside patio was beautiful and the inside was nice and cozy. The bartender and waitress were both really friendly, and I liked my wine. I tried one of the Uruguayan ones, I think it was the tannat. Yum! I was also excited to see the Quilmes beer, as well as the Argentine wines -- I developed a fondness for them when I was studying abroad in Buenos Aires during college and I still love a good malbec more than just about anything else... Unfortunately, Bomberos is kind of far from our place, so I doubt we'll come back very often, but the next time I'm in that part of Phoenix, I definitely want to stop by again.

I had a new experience with this Whole Foods last week.... so, I was shopping at Fry's and noticed that several things on my list were actually CHEAPER at Whole Foods - specifically, basmati rice, quinoa, and tofu. I definitely wasn't expecting that...  Anyhow, the thing I like about the Chandler Whole Foods is that its vibe is waaayy more low-key than other -snooty-nose-in-the-air Whole Foods.  What do I mean? Well, the PV and the Tempe locations always have this snobby vibe to them (The PV one because everyone is rich and snooty, and the Tempe one because the patchouli-smelling hippie workers act like they're better than me just because they have dreds).  The Chandler location, however, is just... there. And the staff is really friendly.  Basically, it has excellent produce, bulk goods and a nice wine selection. They even have a little area where you can buy glasses or wine, or wine flights, of the selections they sell. That's pretty cool. I've never tasted all the fresh food they sell, like the Japanese station or the calzones, etc. But it looks good.  One star off, however, for the salad bar. Two times, I've found wilted lettuce, wrinkly tomatoes and SOGGY ONIONS for sale there. Ick. I've stopped buying the salads there, now, and only do that if I'm at the Whole Foods on Rural and Baseline, which has a better salad selection.

Eh.... 2.5 stars, maybe? 3? Not sure, yet.  After looking at the menu online, I really wanted to like this place. The menu has some creativity to it, unlike the template-North-Indian-restaurant-menus you find at many of the Indian restaurants in the Valley. Aside from offering things like korma, kadai, vindaloo, etc. with a variety of options (chicken, lamb, paneer, shrimp or fish for each) they also have some other more unusual choices, like one of my favorite dishes, mattar malai methi (creamy fenugreek and peas). And dahi vada in the appetizers... I couldn't wait to check it out. Unfortunately, three friends and I went at lunchtime on a Saturday - and there was a buffet. So I didn't get to try any of those tempting dishes.  The restaurant itself, while  decorated a little haphazardly (Chinese paintings?) is bright and clean. There's a TV on a wall, which happened to be playing one of my favorite Bollywood movies...so I was still excited about the place.  But...after tasting the food...meh.  The buffet was all right.. but nothing to write home about. Pluses? Once again, it had something different..fish curry as well as an Indian-style Chinese dish or two. So that was cool. But the food was just so-so. I was there fwith three other people - one of them said the cuts of meat, especially the chicken, were of higher quality than most Indian buffets. But he didn't like the sauces so much. One other friend said he liked the tikka masala, but that was about it. As for the vegetarians, well, we didn't have a lot of choices. Veggie manchurian (which was pretty good), a very bland chana masala and some pea/carrot thing that reminded me more of baby food than anything else. The dessert was just all right, too. And the rice was very bland.  So, overall, I wasn't impressed. But I don't want to judge the place too harshly based just on the buffet. After all, Curry House was packed on a Saturday afternoon, so I'm thinking maybe it's got something better to offer me.. I'll have to go back for dinner and see what their non-buffet selections taste like before I totally write this place off my list.

Aaah! This place, which was known for its very strong margaritas, is under new ownership. And the drinks are WEAK, people! Very, very sad. Not that I probably need the extra alcohol, but still.. My husband and I went here over the weekend, used to the margaritas we've had for years (chambord for me, sixth-street for him). We tasted them and, blech! They tasted like they came from those Tastee-freeze machines at a state fair, or something. When my husband complained to the waitress, she simply told him that if he wanted a strong drink he "should order the frozen ones." Right... Seriously, the rude waitress thing was something new, too. Usually people there have been really friendly. Then I had the same wild mushroom enchiladas I've always had. I was dismayed to find that the enchiladas now include squash and carrots and other veggies inside. It really ruins the flavor. Not only that, but the yummy black bean and avocado-onion-tomato salsa that used to come as a side dish has been replaced with -- carrot and raw onion strips. Who the hell eats carrot sticks with an enchilada??? Ugh. They've ruined this place, which used to be my favorite standard Happy Hour/cheap food place. So, so sad. Any recommendations for a new happy hour, anyone?

I love drinking in airports.  Mostly because I hate flying.  Desert Springs Brewing Company  isn't so much a "brewing company" as it is a tiny airport bar at Sky Harbor. It's connected to some sort of hotdog place and smells like mustard. It's fairly ghetto. However, the wine was there and wasn't terribly expensive, so it was all right with me. Until I saw the fruit flies. Everywhere along the bar. One landed in my water. Then I realize there was an entire fruit fly infestation all along the back of the bar. I decided not to order any garlic fries after all, paid my tab, and walked several spaces down to the Fox Sports bar, where it did not smell like mustard.  I wouldn't really recommend this place if you're in terminal 4. However, if you're in a hurry and there's a crowd at Fox, try it out. At least the service was quick...

Guru Palace has quickly become the favorite lunch spot of mine, and another coworker. While I wouldn't typically recommend an Indian lunch buffet - this place has a great one. It's like $8 and the selection is much wider than what is typically served at other buffets -- and the dishes changes from day-to-day so that's nice, too. Along with the ever-present chana masala and chicken tikka masala, there's usually several other veggie dishes, like pureed eggplant, or eggplant and potato... it's all quite good. There are always three desserts, too, and the chai is delicious. The highpoints, however, are the fresh garlic naan they bring (best in the Valley, IMO) and the very friendly waitstaff, who I think are the owners, too.

I would give Pink Polish a 4.5, if I could, for being great at what it is: a more upscale version of the cheap manicure/pedicure places.  My friend and I spotted this place last weekend, as we were about to pop into Swaddee's for an early dinner -- it's in the same strip mall. It looked brand new and really cute, so we peeked in the window.  I was hesitant at first --  mostly because I'm really suspicious of strip mall manicure shops. I really hate the salons where a bunch of poor middle-aged Vietnamese women are huddled over some snotty girl's nails, wearing face masks, spray-painting on polish and little tacky flowery designs - sorry, but it makes me feel really guilty and slimy, if not exploitative. So, if I ever get a manicure, I generally pay up the whazoo and go to a fancy spa. My friend dragged me in here, though, and it was a great surprise -- bright, and decorated in this whole pink-black-white 1950's glam decor. They used only OPI nail polish, which I really like, and they had a great selection. They played Frank Sinatra over the loudspeakers. The manicurists were friendly and took their time to do a good job. There were a few oddities -- like what looks like a bar in one side of the room. Also, some of the decorations were a bit odd. But overall, it was a really nice -- what other nail salon has granite countertops for you to put your hands on? Very cool. One of the women at the front desk said they just opened a few weeks ago and were "trying to do something a little bit different." They definitely succeeded. I don't remember exactly how much my manicure was -- I think 12 or 15 bucks. It was well worth it.

I was apprehensive to try this place last night after remembering some pretty negative reviews - but it looked so nice from the outside that my friends and I decided to give it a try. We're really glad we did!  From the moment we walked in the door, we were greeted, offered our choice of tables and given really friendly service. There was music, but it wasn't so loud we couldn't hear each other. And the wine list was amazing (much better than Kazmierz, frankly, where we had just been).  After hitting a complete dud at Kazmierz earlier in the night, I was hoping to finally get a good wine - and the malbec I had was fabulous. Really good wine.  My husband also decided to try the sweet potato fries and they were AMAZING. The best thing I've tasted in weeks, seriously. AMAZING.  I'll definitely come back to Fine's. Loved the laid-back atmosphere and the menu.

Now that I've been married for about 6 months, I finally remembered to review Piece of Cake Desserts. This business was, by far, one of the most professional and easy-to-deal-with establishments I worked with while wedding planning.  My husband and I started off with tastings at a few bakeries, but we found most of be either bland, dry or even worse, really really dense and heavy. Ick.  Amy's cakes were moist and fluffy and the flavors were creative and tasty. We tried a Kahlua-icing that we almost chose -- but then she indicated she was really open to trying new flavors. I'd always wanted a pumpkin-flavored cake based off my mother's old recipe for pumpkin and dark-chocolate-chip cookies (don't laugh, they're delicious). Amy gladly did that, and added little chocolate pieces into it. It was delicious. I've never seen wedding guests actually go back for second helpings of cake before, but they did at my wedding.  And on top of all that, she decorated the cake beautifully. I gave her a photograph of the henna designs that I had on my hands during our wedding ceremony in India several months earlier. Based on that, she did an amazing job replicating the exact designs onto the cake. And I didn't even have to have that horrible fondant icing like some other bakers insist on -- she was able to do it on a buttercream. Her prices are well below many other wedding cake bakers in the Valley. I would gladly recommend this place to anyone who needs a wedding, birthday or any other cake!

After reading the lackluster reviews of Digestif, I didn't even want to come here. But my husband made reservations a few days ago, and I went along with it. I'm  really glad I did.  First of all, I thought the atmosphere was great. To be fair, we were here on a weeknight and the weather was lovely, so we got to sit outside. But the noise level was just fine, the service was very professional and quick (but not TOO quick) and our food was good. I ordered the beet and citrus salad (which was very good, except for the parsley, which seemed to overwhelm the entire dish) and the ravioli of goat cheese, tomato and sweet corn. It was very tasty, though I did think the presentation, which had it sitting in some sort of oily broth, was a little off-putting.  My husband had the daily terrine and pan-seared duck breast, which he said was amazing. Our server saw I couldn't decide on wine, so he recommended the Novy nebbiolo, which was really great - one of the best wines I've ordered at a restaurant lately, and affordable, too. What I really think this place has going for it, however, is -- well, perhaps obviously -- the digestif menu. There's such a wide selection, and it's really unique to the restaurant. My husband and I shared a Green Chartreuse and WOW.  It's a four star, not five star, experience, however, because the food, unlike the Digestif, did not completely "wow" me. But I do think this is a great, fun place to come for dinner, with good food and great drinks.

I can't believe this place is tucked in a strip mall with a Subway and a Fry's! I came here at 8 a.m., right when they opened their doors, on a weekday last week and there was already a line! The aroma was wafting out into the parking lot.. yum! Scratch is really cute - fashionable with pink and black walls and cool vintage Vogue covers on the walls. The  pastries are great. The downside? They're really pricey. I think the almond croissants are $3 a pop. But they are heavenly. My husband is completely addicted to this place. Their coffee is good, too, and its organic and fair-trade.  I tried their sandwiches last weekend, though, and wasn't impressed. They were just too expensive for what amounted to a (admittedly great) slice of bread and cheese. But I'd like to try their quiche next time.  I'd definitely recommend coming to Scratch -- just get here early, before they sell out of their croissants!

I'm SO glad they opened up a BevMo that's somewhat near me. This place is great. They have a diverse wine selection.  My husband and I are going to Argentina in a few weeks, and I wanted to find some wines from vineyards we'll be visiting -- it was easy here. There were a lot of different choices, and  I ended up buying a great bottle of Tapiz malbec for $17. It was wonderful. - It's not worth deducting any starts, but the only teeny-tiny complaint I have about this place is its closeness to ASU and, therefore, the likelihood that you'll wander past a few Typical Frat Guys who are discussing what "great chard" will impress this "chick" they want to "get on." Umm.... none? Ick.

Mosaic was such a pleasant surprise!  You know that sinking feeling you get when you walk into an expensive restaurant only to find pounding music and a crowd more worried about style than substance? That's what I was expecting when my husband told me we were going to some 'fancy' place in "Scottsdale." But I was totally wrong.   This beautiful restaurant, surrounded by the desert and Pinnacle Peak, was quiet, romantic -- and yet laid-back.   First, let's start off with the wine list. It was enormous, containing   wines from well-known wineries, as well as from smaller ones. It notes wines that are organic or grown using sustainable agriculture, etc.  In addition to meat and fish entrees, the menu offers a wonderful vegetarian dish for each course, which included choices like a potato, saffron and parsnip soup and a salad that had fennel, endive and olives.  For our main course, my husband had some entree of kangaroo loin and ostrich. While I, personally, couldn't really stomach the thought of him eating a kangaroo, he said it was delicious. I was surprised to see they actually had a tofu dish as an entree, complete with barley, gourmet mushrooms, veggies and a great sauce. Did I feel lame paying nearly $20 for a tofu dish? Yes. But was I pleased to see the chef was considerate enough to  remember vegetarians? Yes. For dessert, we shared a citrus-almond cake. It was delicious. Absolutely delicious. I'd highly recommend this place. It's pricey, but with it's slow-food focus and its creative meals, it's one of those rare places that you feel is actually worth it. Also, the food was very healthy, and we left without feeling uncomfortably stuffed.

The Mesa Family YMCA is a great value. I admit, big expensive fancy gyms turn me off -- I hate feeling like I'm walking into a Scottsdale Club when all I want to do is work out in my crappy workout clothes (seriously: I don't have enough money to waste it all on clothing that I wear to sweat in -- wtf?).  That's why I like the Y. It's close to my office, so I often stop in after work. They offer a lot of classes, and the yoga and kickboxing ones I've been to are very good. I've also taken their water aerobics classes with one coworker -- everyone else was about 80. It was awesome!  They just updated their weightlifting equipment and their exercise machines are OK. Basically, this gym has everything you NEED, without a lot of extras -- but that's ok with me. Everyone is pretty friendly, too. One downside is the neighborhood -- My car got broken into in their parking lot last year and I lost a TON of stuff, so beware!

So, you've never had Burmese food before? I hadn't, either -- until going to Little Rangoon this weekend.    According to the menu, "Burma shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China, Laos and Thailand, and so its cuisine is invariably influenced by these surrounding cultural spices, seasonings, ingredients and cooking styles." And yet, it was completely different from anything I'd had before, too.    Little Rangoon has a lovely atmosphere. It's one of those restaurants that has nice decorations and a romantic feel to it -- like an expensive restaurant would -- but still manages to price its entrees between $8-16. This place is definitely not a hole-in-the-wall -- it's pretty, with nice art on the walls. For starters, my husband ordered the chicken curry pastry puffs, which were really good, he said. For entrees, I decided to try something called "samosas and Ba-Yar Gyaw Soup," which is a tasty thick yellow bean soup with cabbage, onion, potato and tamarind juice. It's presented with broken up pieces of samosa and Ba-Yar-Gyaw (dried split peas crushed and deep fried). It was $8 and it was SO AWESOME. If I could have this for lunch everyday, I would. The owner told us that particular soup is really popular among the women who come in for their lunch breaks.  My husband, meanwhile, ordered the coconut milk chicken curry, which he loved. He said it had high-quality ingredients, and the taste was more subtle than a Thai or Indian curry would be. For dessert, I ordered Burmese semolina cake, which was nice, but heavy.  He ordered Falooda, which is this funky rose-flavored milk, icecream, tapioca, bread pudding and jello strips all mixed into a sundae dish (It's quite the acquired taste -- although I like it). Throughout dinner, the owner was very friendly about discussing Burmese cooking, etc. The waitresses were friendly, too. I really hope this place makes it -- it's tucked in the same complex as a Claim Jumper, Tapino and Radda wine bars and Sushi on Shea, so it has a lot of competition for diners. But in my opinion, it's the best on the block!

Note: This review is simply for drinks and snacks -- I'd like to go back here soon and eat dinner, and then revise the review.  This place is beautiful! And it has a great patio, as well as a great open-air room that isn't really a patio, but isn't really inside -- basically, this is a great place to come with your friends for a drink after work or on a lazy Sunday. Which is what I did yesterday.  We sat down outside, were promptly given some water and our drinks (I had the white sangria, which wasn't quite as good as I had hoped it would be, but it was only $5 and it was tasty). Then we had some chips and salsa -- if the salsa here is any indication of what the food tastes like, then it gets good reviews from me. The big bowl of typical salsa was OK, but the two little containers they gave us were way better -- one was a tangy green salsa, the other was a spicy "chile arbol." They were really complex, compared to what generally passes as salsa at big Mexican restaurants around here. Service was great, too. Can't wait to come back here.

A star for the cute name. A star for the cozy, funky atmosphere. A star for the friendly service. And one for the food.  Overall, a great place!  My husband and I came to Chez Monieux last week. When we arrived there were a few other tables occupied, but we were told to grab a seat whereever we wanted. For appetizers, I ordered the jalepeno hush puppies and my husband ordered the boudin balls.  It took a while for them to arrive, but when they did, they were tasty - though I'm sure they weren't healthy! Our entrees were the vegan gumbo (for me) and the seafood gumbo (for him). My vegan dish came with a really yummy side of potato salad, too. Our dishes were well made and tasty. I was a little disappointed that, unlike the menu said, there wasn't any okra or seitan-sausage in mine, just the fake chicken. But it still tasted good. As soon as our food came out, the chef came to our table and apologized, profusely, for the wait. We hadn't really thought much of it, as we were enjoying our conversation, but I thought it was really nice of him to come and apologize! For dessert, we split a caramel-lava cake, which was delicious. And our whole bill, including a beer and a coke, only came to $32!We'll definitely come back, hopefully when I can try the fried green tomato po' boy!

I'd like to congratulate Pita Jungle on having the balls to move into the deserted shithole that is West Mesa -- someone has to do it first! Now there is a great, healthy restaurant that's open past 8 p.m (they're open 'til 10! 10 p.m.! In West Mesa! Can you believe it?!?) As typical with Pita Jungle, the food was tasty and fresh. And it was served up a little faster than some of the other locations because it was less crowded. Also, the building looks really cool. However the renovated it, they did a great job -- it's open and much sunnier than some of their other spots. I'm sure I'll be coming here a lot for weekday lunches.

Yum! Frozen Custard! I've been dreaming of it since I got back from a visit to Green Bay last summer ;)  I was excited to hear that Culver's opened here in Mesa -- I don't eat their burgers, but it' s nice to have a place for frozen custard -- there are so few places for any type of frozen dessert in Phoenix (which is odd, considering how hot it is) and there are even fewer places for custard. When I went to Culver's last weekend, I had the  peanut butter cup custard -- it was delicious. My husband didn't really see the difference between custard and ice cream, so I had to give him the custard speech: It's really different! First of all, custard is so creamy, when you jab your spoon in it, it just sticks there. Custard won't even fall off your spoon. And it has a much more egg-y flavor, probably because there is more butterfat and more egg yolks in custard than in ice-cream. There's also a lot less air in custard, making it denser than ice cream.   While Culver's was never my FAVORITE place for custard when I lived in Wisconsin, I have a lot of fond memories of hanging out at the place in high school, and I'm glad to see it brought here to the Valley.

Thanks to Alicia B's review, my husband and I hired Camelback Moving Inc. to help us move to a new apartment. We were so apprehensive, having only terrible past experiences with moving companies.... and as soon as our movers showed up, we were SO relieved!  Not only were they right on time, but they were SO friendly and professional! They moved very quickly, but at the same time, they didn't seem rushed, and they were very careful with all our things.  All I can say is that I was worried about not knowing where all our furniture would fit in our new place, etc, but they helped out with everything. The price was also good -- I'd definitely recommend this company to anyone who is moving places here in the Valley.  ** P.S. It's 112 people. Don't forget to offer your movers a bottle or water or something.

This place just opened up about a week ago, and I think it's a great addition to the Indian restaurants in the Valley.  My husband and I went to eat dinner here last night and, even late on a Monday, it was crowded. Beware - it's a small space, so if you are going on a weekend, I would call for reservations.  The restaurant, located next to the India Plaza on Apache Blvd., is really inviting - it's decorated with bright colors, nice, thick tables and contemporary lights and wall hangings. It has quite a different feel than most Indian restaurants in the Valley. It has fun, upbeat music playing too, although I think it could have been turned down a  *little* to make it easier to talk. I loved the menu, because it is quite varied, offering the 'usual' suspects as well as some different items like Goan fish curry, bitter melon curry, goat curries, and gobi manchurian. AND, it also serves chaat.  My husband and I, however, decided to stick with the more typical offerings for the night. He got the "La Jawab Kadahi Gosht" which was lamb pieces and veggies in a spicy yogurt sauce. It was seasoned really well and delicious. I ordered the malai kofta, which was also delicious and seasoned just perfectly. The rice and naan we ordered were tasty, and I loved the side of raita - instead of just a simple yogurt and cucumber dish that the restaurants around here typically serve, this raita had some veggies mixed in and, I think, little puffed wheat pieces. Yum! All the food comes in copper bowls and plates, too, which I love. The service was quite friendly, albeit a little slow (it took a while to get our food) - however, we felt that was more to do with ironing out some first-week kinks, rather than an indicator of anything more serious.  If you like Indian food, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try.

Wow - I was pleasantly surprised by Brio. When my friend suggested meeting up at SanTan Village, I wasn't too hopeful I'd find a decent place for us to eat. But we both really enjoyed our meals. There was a 45 minute wait for a table, but we quickly snagged a table in the bar area, which wasn't too loud or busy. I had a really delicious malbec and we both had soup as appetizers - lobster bisque and cream of mushroom. They were both delicious, and after eating the soup and the warm bread and flaxseed crisps they give out free, I knew we were probably in for a good meal. When our entrees came, we weren't disappointed. My friend had a scallop and shrimp eggplant spicy risotto (ok, that's not what it was called, but that's what it was) which was great and I had a ricotta-filled ravioli with vodka sauce - it's supposed to come with prosciutto, but they were nice about subbing mushrooms for me instead, since I'm a vegetarian. We didn't have any room for dessert, unfortunately. All in all, this was a really pretty, tasty, and friendly place for dinner. I'd like to return!

I was so afraid to try "Imagine Spain" because, well, I've been craving a great tapas place for years and every time I think I've found one, I've been disappointed. However, I'm glad my husband made me try this place out last night. It was fabulous!  It's much smaller and more simple than I had imagined, first of all. And that's a good thing. It strikes me as a place that focuses on the FOOD, not on the fuss. We had a great night here: Incredibly friendly waitstaff, great wines and sangria, and wonderful tapas. We shared the cheese plate, the sherry mushrooms, the tortilla and some mixture of roasted veggies and (tuna? I think?) along with the complimentary bread and sauces. Also, they gave us a little appetizer for free that was amazing. Then, my husband, dedicated to overstuffing himself, ordered the lamb entree, which he also said was very good. The owner of the restaurant kept coming out to check on the customers, too, and chat with us, which was a nice touch. This is a really great place and I hope that it does well in Scottsdale!

In the past, I've dreaded going to  Urgent Care centers. I've generally felt like they're dirty, crowded, involve long waits and uninterested physicians.  Which is why I'd highly recommend Southwest Urgent Care - they're exactly the opposite. I've been here three times and it's never been crowded, and I've never had a long wait (to be fair, I come in the a.m., which probably helps). The waiting room is immaculate. The staff is friendly. And the physicians have all been great.   An example? Earlier this year, I rushed to this place before leaving for a South American vacation because I was coming down with a nasty sinus/lung problem. Dr. Laney listened to my concerns and gave me some additional medication because he knew I'd be somewhere where I couldn't easily get medical care and he didn't want me to be sick on my honeymoon. Thank God he did, too, as I ended up having to use the "super antibiotic" to kick whatever bug I had.  Anyhow, I've seen another doctor and one of the P.A.s here, too, in the past year, and they've all been great. I'd highly recommend coming here if you are sick and in the East Valley.  Oh and I almost forgot - they let you check in online, so you don't have as long a wait once you arrive!

So, it figures. After four years of living in Phoenix, I would FINALLY find a great Chinese restaurant, oh... approximately six weeks before I move out of the city for good.   Sigh.   I came here the other night with my husband and we picked a few items off the menu. Our food was out within 10 minutes. The portions were very big, and the food (except for the egg rolls) was less greasy than what you get at a lot of other Chinese restaurants around here. My husband had General Tso's chicken, which was tasty, and I ordered the tofu and veggies. The tofu was fried, but lightly, so it didn't get greasy, and the dish was loaded up with crisp veggies including broccoli, carrots, water chestnuts, baby corn..the usual.  It was so good.  Also, this joint has the BEST EGG DROP SOUP I've tasted in Phoenix. Seriously. I'll be honest, I have no idea how Sun Chinese Dining is for more traditional Chinese food. Because that's not really what I'm interested in. But I can tell you that this place does the typical American Chinese food really, really well!

Kudos to the Tempe Library staff for being so amazing during the loooonnngggg early voting procedure, which took up their entire first floor on Friday, when I went.  So, ok, waiting in line for vote for 8 hours sucks. However, at least I was able to do it at this library, which I had never before visited. The place is filled with comfy chairs and great new books! I was able to actually skim through an entire newly-released nonfiction book I've been eyeing at the bookstore while I waited to vote.  Not only that, but the "connections cafe" serves up coffee drinks, sandwiches, soup and snacks. They stayed open late for the voters, which was nice. And it was explained to me that it's a nonprofit cafe, which the money going to help fund children's literacy projects. Awesome, again!  Finally, the librarians were so nice about hundreds of loud, impatient voters camping out. Not once were we told to "shush" and one of them even passed out Halloween candy for us!  Some of them had to stay really late (I left at 10:30 p.m. and they were still there).  Overall, I just think it's cool the library hosted the polling. It was much better to be there than to be stuck at the Mesa city center, standing in line in the heat with nothing to read.  If I lived in Tempe, I'd definitely get myself a library card and come back to this place time and time again.

As I ate my umpteenth-takeout meal from here tonight (mmm...malai kofta...) I thought it was about time for me to review this place. I really like it. The food at Tandoori Times is just more flavorful than it is at many other Indian restaurants in Phoenix, and I believe the ingredients are of a better quality.  I do wish they had slightly more vegetarian options here, and I really wish they had pakoras on the appetizer list -- but other than that, I can't complain. And, while I like the place, my husband absolutely loves it, especially their lamb dishes. Also, I have to admit, I'm emotionally attached to this place as my husband and I had the rehearsal dinner for our wedding here last October. They were able to pull it together for us with only a few weeks notice (our other selection had flaked out on us at the last minute). They were really accommodating when we were running late that night, and even started bringing out appetizers to our guests who got there before us (it was supposed to be a buffet, but they were thoughtful enough to improvise). Everyone loved the food, from the meat-and-potatoes Midwestern uncles to the Indian aunties, so that says a lot right there... also, their outside patio is lovely.

After reading the reviews of this restaurant's other locations, I am at a complete loss for words -- is this supposed to be some great local gem or something? What it seemed like to me was a big old Mexican chain restaurant full of overpriced cheddar-filled enchiladas. It wasn't *bad* food, but it was unremarkable. I came here for lunch and was seated promptly. The chips and salsa were quite tasty. I was surprised to see the prices on the lunch menu, though -- $10-$11 for vegetarian dishes like cheese enchiladas or a veggie burrito seemed really high. I went with the burrito, enchilada style. It tasted good. The tortilla was a bit chewy but the veggies were nice.  Ok. That's it. I get that this is supposed to be "Mexican city" style food, whatever that means. I didn't really notice that it had unique flavors to Mexico city, or any other region of Mexico, for that matter. Sigh.  I STILL haven't found a fantastic Mexican restaurant in this city of, what, 5 million people? I'm getting really frustrated. It's been three years! On to the next one...

Loooove Mystic Jewell!  I've been coming here for about a year for dance lessons. It's a great way to get a workout and meet new people. It's a little expensive (I think it's about 5 classes for $70) but it's worth it.  This place offers bellydancing, bhangra, Bollywood and hip hop dance classes. It's a very relaxed environment, which is  cool and unlike some other dance places I've gone.  The best part is the mix of people you will see in various classes here: ASU women's studies students, tattooed ladies, moms, professionals who just want a workout, people who want to try something new... it's very cool. Plus, they do recitals at the end of the class periods which let you show off a bit. You can check their schedules out online, their new classes start every two months or so. Many of the instructors here are in different world dance troupes around the city, so they're fun and really into what they do. I try to drag my friends here all the time after work, and when they finally come, they love it.

The cocktails here deserve more than 5 stars  -- they are amazing!  To the food, however, I'd give only 3 stars = so I'm giving the Merchant, as a whole, 4 stars. Still, that shouldn't discourage anyone from coming to this beautiful restaurant.  I spent a summer in Madison and came back to the Merchant multiple times  for their wonderful drinks. Every single person I brought with me was always impressed. The cocktails are creative and wonderfully balanced. There is no question in my mind that the Merchant's cocktails are superior (and a couple dollars cheaper!) to those of bars in NYC and DC that are known for craft cocktails.  I especially loved a new one on their summer menu that is basically a yerba-mate caipirinha. Amazing! The bartenders are also really friendly, and are always willing to suggest the perfect cocktail or wine for you if you are feeling overwhelmed.  However, the food I've ordered at the Merchant has been a mixed bag. The appetizers and cheese platter have been tasty. But when my husband and I came for dinner, we felt the food wasn't really anything to write home about, and was a bit pricey for what you got. For example, I ordered the small plate of mussels, which included about 12 mussels or so. Fine. Except at least 4 of them weren't even opened. Which meant I couldn't eat 1/3 of my order. Someone in the kitchen should have noticed this before plating it, and, frankly, why were so many of them unopened in the first place? The waitress agreed to bring me out a new dish, which was nice, but it was still a bit odd. The sauce the mussels were in was really bland, too. I can't remember what my husband ate for dinner, but he wasn't terribly impressed either.  For desserts, I've had the tres leches cake twice. The first time it was pretty awful, but the second time it was tastier. I should also note, however,  that the St. Louis Butter Cake with Jam was wonderful.

So this my least favorite Harkin's Theater. That being said, it's also just a few blocks from our new apartment, so, well, it's kind of stupid for us to drive somewhere else to see a movie. Sigh.  Why don't I like this place? 1. Too crowded, with far too many preteens. Sorry if that makes me sound like a crabby old man or something, but WTF? Is this where the entire junior highs and high schools of Chandler hang out???  2. Horrible parking situation 3. Bad A/C. Usually, movie theaters are way too cold. This one errs on the other side - I went to see "Tropic Thunder" today in the middle of the afternoon, thinking it would be nice and cold -- and I ended up sweating through the entire movie. It was hot and really stuffy, with no air flow. Ick.
