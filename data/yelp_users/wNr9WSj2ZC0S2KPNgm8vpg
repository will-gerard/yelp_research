Santa Fe chicken is succulently amazing !! This palace is very unique and the margaritas are awesome. My mother had the Carne adobada and she was so happy that wants to come back again. My bf got the Pasta Heidi , creamy spicy and delicious ! Great place to eat if you are looking for New Mexican style .

I am actually quite happy with Grigio in Tempe Town Lake! My apartment is awesome. The view it couldn't be better as it is facing the lake. It is a peaceful place with an amazing and energetic environment.  The manager and the staff - including the sell people- are humans !! Which means that they understand any issue and are able to help.  I have read many pejorative comments but since I moved here - 6 months ago- I haven't had any issue.  Thanks to Mackenzie and Trevor for your prompt work. You guys are solving problems.  In sum: you pay what you get and If you have an issue ask and it will be solved-

The food is amazing. It feel like in India and the best part is that you can order the meal mild, spicy or super spicy and they will do it for you. Totally worthy and succulent

After waiting outside for a table we got one close to the bathrooms and it was heinous. The large orange juice should have more water than orange. The ambiance is pretty busy so the waitress. Hence, it is a whole mess without mention that the bill arrives just on time to kick us out and welcoming the new victim. The food was ... Oh yes it was as bad as the service. Probably it wasn't my day and not even the sort of place I will repeat. PD: I am not a bacon person.... If you are not a bacon person don't waist your time.. If you are... Check other reviews !

Happy hour are awesome with great prices. I do recommend the hummus and the quinoa balls. The environment is very cosy and the staff is very friendly and polite. We love Haley because she is beautiful polite and always remember our drink.

This place is awesome. It make you feel like eating out in Europe. The service deserve an A+, as well as the food. Check out the local brews including a great  IPA from here in Tempe. The tea selection is unique. Don't miss the Pomegranate tea and the kebab with Persian rice. Yum!!
