Very cheap when they priced my un-used  name brand boy shoes...I  expected more. Didn't take any of my sons nice clothing compared to what they had in the store the clothes I brought where a lot nicer.  Not a Fan!

Nice people good service! Showed them a picture of what I wanted got exactly what I asked for, only down fall is the price I got a gel mani and pedi came out to $82 wayyyyy too pricey $10 for this .....extra $10 for that and so on. Needs to be a set fee for all and have a legit price menu for services. Not sure I'll go back for that much money.
