This place has an amazing happy hour and delicious food! The tacos are my favorite. The funky atmosphere of the Clarendon Hotel also makes for a cool adventure.

Pita jungle is usually pretty good, but I just got frozen basically inedible dolmades in a takeout order and it's making reconsider eating there again. So disappointing.

I really wanted to like this place, but they've let me down too many times. We live right down the street and were excited for a close  seemingly cool restaurant. The food is good and they have a good reverse happy hour...when it's actually available. The past 5 times we have gone on the weekend, they have either been closed or turned us away because they are completely out of food by 9pm ( when the advertised reverse happy hour starts). The excuse is always " we are out of food because we make everything from scratch and our food is fresh"... From my understanding,  most good successful restaurants do that, I don't think that's a very good excuse to always be out of food, especially if you're business is serving food. I don't know how they are still in business but I'm definitely not going back because it's a waste of my time to go there just to be turned away because they aren't serving food. Supply and demand.

I love this place! Just what downtown Phx needed. Great food and a great music venue.

I've been to harumi many times and it's always pretty great, but just went and had the omakase and it was truly incredible. This is a downtown gem, wonderful staff, amazing food, and a laid back vibe.

Delicious food, great service and wonderful pisco sours. They have great vegetarian and meat options. Highly recommended if you are looking for something different near  downtown. The ceviche is incredible!

This place is a great, unique addition to old town. Wonderful wine and craft beer selection and a variety of great small plates. The place is really small but that adds to the charm. The service was fantastic as well. Definitely a new favorite in the area.

Great prices and a great selection. The noodle and produce selection is incredible. Definitely worth the trip even if you're not in the neighborhood.
