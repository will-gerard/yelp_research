Sakana on elliot was busy on this friday visit.  The waitresses were all very helpful (and beautiful) and plenty of them to serve us.  We started with some green tea, and edamame.  Nice size portion on the starter (twice the size of Ra).  For sushi, we had the salmon - which is in the style of Jiro- salmon layed over the cupped sushi rice - delicicious!.  Then we moved to our sushi rolls - the rainbow roll was fantastic - salmon, tuna, shrimp, guac, all very fresh.  The california roll was excellent also.  We had the baked crab roll - which I have to say was not my favorite - supposed to be scallap and crab baked over a cali roll.  All in all, we definitely enjoyed our dinner and will return.

Dr. Quenton Morley is the best in the business.  I live in chandler - and drive into Ahwatukee just to get adjusted by him.   The staff at Ahwatukee Life Center is top notch.  They always great you with a smile, and make you feel glad to be there.  I have been going there for over 20 years now.   Because they are the best.

Chips, bean dip, and salsa was ok. Green burrito, rice and beans were below average. There was no green chili flavor at all - basically it was a brownish, dull flavor. The meat chunks were tough and not fit to eat. The rice and beans tasted a few days old. Margarita was ok, not much alcohol though. I usually go to Rositas which is right across the street - their green burrito (try it smothered in green sauce and cheese) is 100 x's better than Serranos - in fact every thing is better at Rositas. I will head over to the chandler Serranos and try that next time - hopefully they don't bring their food in from the same place as this one.  Honestly I can't believe this place is still in business. Try Rositas instead for some excellent mexican food.

The repair shop does great setups on guitars.  I have had pickups replaced, pickguards,  and many different rewires done here - they are as good or better than anyone in town. PLUS, they carry MESA BOOGIE amps!  I recently bought a Express 5:25 from them - they gave me a great deal - but the service and attention they provide is unmatched.  They ordered a cover for my and called to make sure I recieved it.   I can't tell you how much more pleasant and attentive they are at the Music Store - (100% better than the Guitar Center...)  They have the best selection of sheet music in town also. Give the Music Store your business, you will not be sorry.

Green corn tamale, rice & beans, chips & salsa, and a margarita. One of my all time fav meals. Tamale is one of the best anywhere. Salsa is perfect. This place has been there forever - and there is a reason- good food! Sit at the old school bar and watch a game while you enjoy fantastic Mexican food! I try to make this happen about once a week at Rositas.

Green chili burrito smothered in green sauce and melted cheese, rice and beans - time and time again - one of my fav meals anywhere.  I have tried green burros everywhere - Rositas is always the best.  Chips and salsa (and hot sauce) are the best around -and margaritas are great!  Sit at the bar and Mando always is the best bartender around.  I love Rosita's!!!

Brimley's have been doing my carpet cleaning for years. They always do a nice job and they are professional in every way. They call to let you know when they will arrive. The chem dry process is great - drys in a few hours! They even left me a free chem dry spot remover which is excellent!

This is the best gelato I have had.  Small place, but quality is great.  I get a small size with pistachio on one side and pineapple on the other.  Walk down to zia and check out the cd's while you are eating the best gelato in town.

Quarter chicken white with garlic new potatoes and mixed vegis. I get that meal at least once a week. Chicken is always cooked perfect with great flavor. Chocolate chip cookies are great too!  Staff at Alma/Ray are always friendly and give you a great smile at the drive thru.

The pizza muffins are fantastic - get those and an antipasta salad with a glass of wine and you will be happy!!!  The antipasta salad has lots of vegi's, salami, cheese, and a fantastic italian dressing.  The pizza muffins are rolled up pizza dough, sausage or ham, cheese, and they give you 2 dipping sauces with them.  The pizza and pasta are also good at Florindino's.  Great mom and pop family local Italian restaurant that you must try.

I get a small pesto pizza and side salad- (and the cheesecake is always great too )- one of my all time fav meals. They are always nice at Pestos. It is a great neighborhood restaurant - and the wine bar is great too.

Always a great menu- so many choices! The broiled chicken salad is a favorite. The chicken breast is always perfect - tender and marinated just right, on top of romaine with big tomato wedges, cucumber, and red onion. The best appetizer in the world might be the shrimp dish they have smothered in garlic with pita wedges to help enjoy the sauce. The place is always crowded- because they have great food!

Prime Rib on Wed nights is a tradition at Black Angus.  Prime Rib is always cooked perfect with baked pototo and vegi makes for a perfect meal.  I sit at the bar usually and the bartenders always are friendly and attentive with bringing my beer and food!   One of my fav places to go week after week. Wednesdays are good because you get a piece of mud pie for dessert along with the meal.  Fantastic!

Great coffee, great baristas who smile and remember your name, great couches inside, and great patio next to the lake.  Local coffee shops like this need support - more so than those other big corporations down the road...  And this place has won best of awards - they deserve it.  Sit out by the lake, enjoy the view -and the free wi-fi, and drink your delicious coffee.

I am hooked on the Langostino tacos! Ever since chuy's closed, I have been in search of good fish tacos.  Rubio's is a little expensive, but the food is high quality and worth it. Try the Langostino tacos or burrito. The mahi grilled is great also. I usually go at least once a week to have fish tacos at Rubio's.

The chopped salad with salmon and the potato cream cheese soup is one of my favorite meals. Chopped salad consists of wild Alaskan salmon, arugula, Israeli couscous, feta, red peppers, dried sweet corn, dried cranberries and sunflower seeds served with Pesto Vinaigrette.  It is my favorite salad... And with every order you get a  couple pieces of the famous WF bread - dip it in the soup...  excellent!  They are always quick to put together a take out order. Delicious food. Oh, and great carrot cake also... Always consistent quality.

Abuelos has been there for a long time but for some reason I have never been there. So I decided to try it. Walking in, I was very impressed with the decor - looked like the Cheesecake Factory - or maybe a casino. Sat at the bar and started with a margarita. It was ok. Tasted a little watered down. I had 2 of them - which usually does the trick for me - these must have been really light on tequila because I did not feel the alcohol. They brought chips and 3 salsas. The salsas tasted out of the can - and chips were out of a bag- not much taste. I had a combo with enchilada, tamale, taco, rice and beams. The taco beef tasted like Taco Bell but it did have nice lettuce and tomato - the shell was crisp. Tamale tasted like out of a can although it was sitting on a husk. Avocado enchilada was smothered in a white cheese- the advocado was out of a can - smooth texture with no flavor. The rice and beans were tasty.  I kept waiting for something to kick in after I finished my 2nd drink - it felt like I had 3/4 of a real drink since they were so watered down. My bill was $31. - after tip I walked out spending $36 for a below average meal. Abuelos probably stays in business from sun lakes residents and people in from out of town that think this is the authentic southwest Mexican food.  Go down to Rositas on Dobson/Guadalupe - not much on decor - but the food, chips/salsa, and drinks blow this place away.  Mexican food should have some flavor - Abuelo's is overall very bland.

Excellent bday dinner started with signed bday card from the staff for my bday date - nice touch! Our waitress was wonderful - not too intrusive, but very helpful and even helped put on my girls bday necklace - nice! Dinner started with surprise seared scallop on cheese sauce which was delicious. Wedge salads with blue cheese, nuts, and crisp piece of bacon was fantastic. Then our entree of filet, lobster, asparagus, and Flemings potatoes. Steak cooked perfect - everything was amazing. Then bday desert with chocolate tart filled with gooey chocolate and 2 ice cream scoops, with fresh raspberry. Really, the entire meal and bday experience was perfect - both my bday date and myself were completely impressed. Thank you Flemings for a wonderful night.

If zero stars were a choice that is what I would give them. Bought a GC guitar cable there for $25. 1st time I used it found out the threads were stripped on the end and the cable was shorting out.  Took it back expecting they would replace it - but no...  They refused to replace it since I did not bring the reciept - and would not even look on the computer to see that I had bought it there - they just tried to sell me a high priced monster cable ripoff for $75.  They would not even give me any credit at all for trade in so I could get a better cable.  I asked the clerk to throw it in the trash for me and he said no he could not do that.  I threw it in the trash in front of them and walked out - no words at all from the jerk manager.  Wow, these guys know NOTHING about customer service (customer is always right - treat them right with total customer satisfaction and you have a loyal customer forever???)  BTW, I had seen a new HSS strat in there that I was going to add to my collection for $1350 - but you can be damn sure I will not buy it from them. This is the 2nd time I have been belittled and disrespected in the elliot store.  I bought a mackie p.a. from them and they would not work with me at all when I had electrical issues with it.  I will go to MILANOS from now on - where you can always get personal service from a business that respects you.

Robert has worked on my guitars for over 30 years.  He is hands down the best in the valley when it comes to guitar repair.  The guitar repair section of the store is all I have used.  The rest of the store has some music instruments for sale, and for rent.  Local stores like this are much better to deal with than your big corporate stores.  Better service, better quality - thank you Robert!

Amazing, but everyone that has ever gone to Chandler High School always returns to Elmers!  Why?  Because they have great food!  Bean and cheese burro with sauce and strips - I have only had this meal a thousand or more times in the last 30 years...  Elmers hot sauce is the best ever - and the cheese on the strips tastes SO GOOD along with that hot sauce!!!  Not much on decor inside, so get it to go -and enjoy!!!

We had an amazing dinner at D&C - one of my all time favs. We started with a salad - I had the house with blue cheese and Alanna had the wedge - both were cold and excellent. For dinner,  1/2 BB Ribs and shrimp for my beauty, and I had the salmon with baked potato. Salmon was perfect, and I always love how they do the potato - with salt and pepper on the skin always makes it delicious to eat the whole thing... We sat right under the Ted Williams bat which was very cool. Excellent service as always.

I always and looking for a good place to have pizza.  After a movie at camelview, we stopped into Grimaldi's based on a friends recommendation.  We had a large pizza with pepperoni.  I have to say, it was the most delicious tasting pizza I have had in a long time.  The crust is absolutely perfect.  It is thin crust, and maybe the best I have had.  The crust has a savory tast - I believe it is basted with butter and garlic, but the flavor is mouth watering.  The sauce is tomato based, and flavorful - not spicy, but has a great taste.  The cheese was also perfect - mozzerella along with the fresh pepperoni is a simple yet great combo.  The server was friendly, and very helpful in explaining the menu.  The prices are a little high - if all you are used to is calling in a pizza from dominos.... but if you want  a high quality, mouth watering pizza, try Grimaldi's.  I will definitely be back.

Ceasar salad was perfect, chicken and rice was the best I have ever eaten, corn on cob with chili butter was amazing, and the homemade Oreo desert was incredible. By the way, the service was 5 star all the way. No wonder this place has a wait most every night. Wish I could eat there 8 nights a week...

Started with escargot - in mushroom caps - dip the bread into the butter and garlic - my fav appetizer of all time! We had the Alaskan king crab legs with rice and vegis - which has to be one if the best meals money can buy. The expert waiter cracks the crab to perfection- leaving you to dip the very large and incredibly sweet crab meat into the melted butter - and experience a true feast! San Rimo shrimp dish is also excellent - both in appetizer or pasta dinner. Owner Richard Huie chatted with us and thanked us for coming on our way out. A wonderful experience that is always consistently excellent every time we dine at the Salt Cellar.  5 star all the way.

Really cool how they have tables thru out the store area - lots of great specialty foods and bread is great. Had a turkey and Swiss sub to go. Bread was excellent, turkey fresh, lettuce fine cut. Nice selection of ice tea. I will definitely stop in again and try other menu items.

We have been going to Monti's since the 70's. Always an enjoyable meal, and take a walk down Mill ave after dinner to top it off! I usually get the ribeye with a loaded baked potato. This particular visit, I had the sirloin - it was cooked to perfection and was absolutely delicious!  The ambiance and history on the walls is priceless. Monti's is always a good meal and a great place to take out of town guests.  Last time we were there - we had our dinner, then walked across mill ave bridge to catch a concert at the Marquee theatre - seeing the lights across the lake was a fantastic sight!

We started with the Oreganos Salad -  usual vegi's etc - nothing special - it was definitely not chilled enough. The drinks were good (should be for $7) Then we ordered a Margherita pizza. We were looking forward to a great thin crust pizza- but after hearing the ravs of this place, I have to say I was very disappointed. First of all, it was almost cold. It must have sat there at least 5-10 min out of the oven before they brought it.  The flavor was quite bland.  I can tell you at least 10 different places in the valley with tastier pizza than this. In fact, Paul Newman's FROZEN Margerita pizza is better than this - it is better tasting, crust,  toppings, and you don't have to sit on hard  wood chairs for 45 minutes waiting for it. Ok so we wanted some dessert -so how about some cheesecake?  They don't have any - first Italian place I have ever been in that doesn't have cheesecake.  So we get the cookie- wait another 25 minutes. Nothing special... So after 2.5 hours including the wait for the table - and $65 - wow- I can say this was a total disappointment.  Maybe it was just an off night???  Not sure, but I probably will not return.  Go to Grimaldi's, Pestos, or Floridinos in Chandler - all have better food, service,  atmoshphere,  and value.

Camelview is the best theatre in the valley.  Small compared to the big box theatre - it is a harkins - so wear your shirt and bring your cup to get your coke and popcorn for $1 - you just cannot beat harkins!  Camelview is known for showing independent and smaller films that your 24 plex will not show.  The staff at the snack counter is always fast and attentive - more so than the big theatres.  You will always get good service with a smile at camelview.  That is why I drive in from chandler on a regular basis to see movies there.  They make you feel welcome, and that you are part of a movie experience.

Mediterranean pizza along with the shrimp  and salmon salad. Wow, this was a perfect meal for the two of us to split - along with a glass of chard wine. The salad was one of the best I have ever had. And the pizza had the greatest crust ever. Our waitress was fantastic. We definitely enjoyed everything about our dinner- and can't wait to go back.

I have only been coming to Serrano's for 30 or so years... Salsa and chips with the warm bean dip is always great - I always get a taco, enchilada, rice, and beans. Ric and family have provided great food for chandler for a long time - the other locations are also very consistent excellent quality Mexican food.

Wow, I had eaten here before and it was good. But today was another story. Ordered the Pork BBQ sandwich and beans. Waiting for my food, I noticed there were multiple flies in the restaraunt which is not a good sign... Then I got my food. Now, I like a good BBQ sandwich and was looking forward to this!  BUT, the bun was wet on the bottom, and when I picked it up, the meat fell through. It was not wet with bbq sauce either. It was more like water, which was slightly disgusting. I tried to eat the meat with a fork- there was almost no BBQ sauce and NO flavor.   I threw it in the trash and left. I was very dissatisfied.

We walked in and as always, were greeted with a smile - the owner remembered us, and where we liked to sit at the sushi bar. We had the yellow tail sashimi, rainbow roll, spicy tuna roll, and AZ roll. Our fav sushi by far-  the sushi chefs are friendly and ask you with a smile if you are enjoying their beautiful sushi creations. At the advise of our wonderful waitress at the bar - we had the tempura ice cream which was a perfect way to finish our meal. The staff there always makes is feel welcome.  When we leave there, we always feel like they have made us a part of their family.  Wonderful experience as always - we will return soon - again and again!

Zia always has a great selection of both cd's and dvd/blu-ray.  And the great thing with zia, is you can trade in your old media - cd, dvd, video games etc, for credit toward buying new stuff.  I usually go thru my cd's and dvds, then head down to zia - trade it in and come home with something new.  If they do not have it, they order it and call you when it arrives.  The staff are always knowledgable and helpfull.  I have been going to zia in tempe for many years - and the chandler location is just a good if not better.

Chicken club is always excellent - two. Strips of bacon and Swiss cheese on soft warm bun, along with garlic fries is a fantastic meal. The TK wings are the best I have ever had - anywhere. Beer is always very cold and of course the beautiful girls are always easy on the eyes. The huge bar is a great place to sit - lots of tv's with sports and lots of seats. Believe it or not, the food is excellent and is the reason to go there - and of course the girls are great too!

I sat at the bar -right next to the fantastic fireplace. I had a cheeseburger with bacon, and a couple blue moons. The burger was fantastic- smoky flavor from the wood fire grill, crisp lettuce, onions, and tomato. Beer was very cold -and delicious... Bartenders were friendly, and the mood very relaxed in the cozy bar setting.  Firebirds is great, and I will try to make this a part of my fine dining rotation of favorites.

My previous review was 4 stars, but this time(12-23-11), things were different.  There were 3 girls behind the bar.  The one that initially took my order gave me my beer, but the beer was not very cold, and the glass appeared to have just been washed - it was warm which is not good especially when the beer is $6...  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger.  After that, and I kid you not, this was the last time I was acknowledged at the bar- mainly because the girl that took my order apparantly went on break and the other 2 did not seem to interested in taking care of me.  My cheeseburger arrived and it was well done- as in over cooked so much the edges were burnt - after I had specifically ordered it medium.   When I needed another beer, I had to flag one of the bartenders down. As I was eating, I sat there for maybe 5 minutes with no one so much as looking at my empty beer.   She finally brought me a beer and was not polite at all- acted like she was put out - no smile, no asking if I needed anything else.  I have to tell you, there were maybe 10-12 people at the bar, and these 3 girls could NOT handle everyone.  Yes, it was busy in the restaurant for dinner, but that does not mean they ignore the customers at the bar. The next bartender that came over to start washing the glasses, started talking to the guy next to me about her kids xmas presents - she had a loud voice and the last thing I wanted to hear was her whine about her kids while I ate my burger.  Well, that is what happened - for at least 5 minutes.  In a supposedly upscale place, do I really need to listen to that???  My nerves had just about had it...   When I tried to pay, I waited 5 minutes to get someone to take my credit card.  With no one paying attention enough to get my bill taken care of, I threw down some cash and left.  I have to tell you, I cannot remember the time I left less than 15% tip, but this time I did.  I could not wait to get the heck out of there.  I was not happy at all and was in fact, very upset and mad at the situation when I left.  I should have complained to the manager but just wanted to get out of there.   Next time, I will just drive thru INN-N-OUT and save $15, get better service, and better food.

Hi, I just wanted to let you know that I have been returning over and over to Kings Fish House.  One of my fav meals: I had a half dozen oysters - which are always the finest in the valley in my opinion. I told the oyster shucker, the waitress, and the manager  that I always totally enjoy the oysters at your Kings Fish House.  The best there is! I also had the grilled swordfish, rice, and spinich - with 2 glasses of chardonnay. The warm sour dough bread and butter was also incredible tasty with my wine! One of my fav meals for sure.  I love King's Fish House. Also I asked the bartender to turn on the stanley cup game and they promptly took care of it.  I sat at the oyster bar which I like to do so I can watch them prepare the oysters!  It was an excellent meal.  See you next week!

We walked in and were completely impressed by the ambiance and the overall look of the entire place.  We stared with the shrimp cocktail - which had Fresh gulf shrimp, chunky avocados & pico de gallo in a spicy cocktail sauce.  I can say, this was the best shrimp cocktail I have ever had.  We also split a ceasar salad which was perfect.  For dinner, I had the Mahi blackened over dirty rice .  The fish was fresh and spicy - all their fish is flown in daily.  My date had the Pasta Mardi Gra - Linguine tossed with crawfish, andouille sausage & crimini mushrooms in a marinara cream sauce topped with jumbo grilled shrimp. . .  This dish was quite spectacular... We thought we were in New Orleans...  For desert, we had NY Cheesecake - with fresh strawberries in a sauce - topped with fresh whipped cream - I can't think of any cheese cake I have ever had that was better than this...  The desert plate they bring to the table has all the deserts on there - they all looked amazing- quite a difficult choice... WOW - the entire dinner was perfect!  AND on top of it all, our service was top notch.  SAM was excellent - he talked with us and explained the items we had questions on, cleaned the table in between courses, and gave us fresh silver ware - along with always keeping our drinks full.  And he had a great attitude - he acted like he wanted to make our dinner very special.  The manager came and talked with us also, and thanked us for coming in.  Quite impressive.  This was one of the most memorable dinners we have had, from the time we walked in the door until we walked out.  We were completely impressed with Pappadeaux - and can't wait until we return.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would, it is worth it.

Well, you know what they say - when a place is always busy, there is usually a reason. I have gone into STB several times and could not find a place to sit at there huge bar - why?  Because the food is fantastic and everyone loves it!!!  We both had the chandler burger this time- that includes chedder cheese and thin onion rings on top - with horsey sauce... cooked to PERFECTION with slight pink in the middle - juicy and delicious!!! This burger is absolutely great!!!  Home brewed beer is always great and waitresses serve you with a smile.  No wonder they just got another award in Best of New Times - they deserve it!

I go here at least 3 times a week. For a single person, the pre-made meals are fantastic. The pasta is always great, and I always get the salmon filet with brown rice and vegi - for $6 you just can't beat it.  Throw in microwave for a few minutes for a quick healthy meal. I regularly buy produce there. The fresh and easy Greek yogurt is the best. The fresh grapefruit juice is always a fav. They have a great selection of nuts, trail mixes for a great price. Their meats are always great- the chicken breast is always perfectly cut. Go to their website and sign up for weekly coupons- they email me coupons that make shopping there very affordable.  $5 off when you buy $25 of groceries - a great value!

I was in the mood for a good cheeseburger so I tried chili's near Chandler mall. Not sure if I was just starving - but the old timer with cheese was fantastic! Perfectly cooked and very tasty. The fries were good too. And in the bar, they have great tv's - and the bartender was friendly. I have had the ribs also - they are great to take out.  So I will definitely put chili's in my rotation!

I am a frequent visitor to this chilis at chandler mall.  I have to write this review because I am tired of getting my burger cooked well done.  This is the 3rd time in a row that I have ordered a burger MEDIUM (not well done).  I ordered the bacon burger - bacon was nicely cooked but AGAIN, the burger was like shoe leather.  What is it with these places so afraid of getting people sick they can't leave any pink in the burger???  Yes the blue moon was good, yes the bartender was friendly, but I was not happy with my shoe leather well done burger that I ordered medium. I will return, but I will definitely let them know next time what I expect.

Top Shelf has been in business since the 70's.  How does a restaurant stay in business that long - especially with this economy?  GOOD FOOD!  Top Shelf has had consistently good mexican food for the last 30+ years and we always enjoy going there.  The Top Chimi with guacamole and sour cream is always good.  And the basics - taco, enchilada, rice and beans are as good as anyone in the valley.  You get a big bowl of chips with a large bowl of very tasty salsa when you are seated.  Also, you must try the cheese crisp.  We always say it is the best out of all the mexican places we have tried.  AND, we always get service with a smile when we go.

We started by walking in thru one of the biggest doors I have ever seen - into a restaurant full of excellent ambiance. For starters, we split the rolled mozzarella with tomatoes, and a Cesar salad that featured fresh Parmesan cheese, olive tapenade, and a very savory dressing. My date had the herb chicken with fingerling potatoes and spinach - chicken was perfectly cooked and delicious. I had the grilled salmon over angel hair pasta with mushrooms.  Watching the owner cook our meals was a real treat. Our dinners were both perfect. Our service staff was helpful and attentive. On our way out, Eddie took time to shake our hands and asked how we enjoyed our night. I do not give many 5 star reviews, but our entire experience at Eddie's House was wonderful. We are very much looking forward to returning.

We started with the mushroom appetizer - deep fried and dipping sauce is horseradish flavored - very delicious!  I had the grilled salmon with sweet potato and broccoli - all perfectly prepared - my date had the talapia - for dessert we had the brownie and ice cream which was enough for at least 4 people!  All this food for $19.99 M thru W.  Our server was excellent also. A fantastic deal and the food is excellent.  We will definitely return.

A huge disappointment. I saw this show 3 years ago and it is very good. He seems completely bored with no enthusiasm. The illusions were boring. The one big illusion broke down in the middle and they stopped it and apologized. He brought up a 15 year old kid on stage and wasted 20+ minutes talking with him. I wanted to yell "get on with it!!!".  It is time to shut Believe down. NOT worth the money.

Irish Republic-  Since San Tan Brewery was to busy, I walked into this place - which was not busy at all- that was the 1st red flag... First impression was it smelled bad when I walked in - probably all of the musty $1 bills stapled to the wall. Nice HD tv's - 5 of them at the bar.  Bar was sticky and uncleaned - with wadded up paper napkins and an used glass in front of the bar where i sat - which the bartender never did bother to pick up.  Stella beer was not very cold.   Bartender did not know they had a chicken sandwich - he had to look at the menu. That should have been a warning to not order it I guess. The bun was good. The chicken was not seasoned - flavorless and full of connective tissue- no wonder the bartender never bothered to ask me how everything was... But only served a few fries - definitely not enough - ketchup bottle was sticky and empty. I ate half of my sandwich, drank half the beer and left.  I will not return there- and btw,  it takes quite a poor experience for me to rate a bad review.  They could definitely learn something about customer service, along with food quality.

This is a great place to take out.  They flat out have the best teriyaki chicken bowl in town.  Always consistent.  And they have sushi also - it is great!  I get the teriyaki chicken bowl and edamami to go all the time.  Call in and it is ready in 10 minutes.  Try it, you will enjoy it for sure.

A friend and I sat at the bar for lunch. We had the baja tacos. 3 battered tacos with rice and black beans. The tacos were very good- the flour tortilla seemed home made. Overall, we were fairly impressed with the food. It is the service that left us unimpressed. The girl behind the bar was more interested in talking to her friends than serving us.  I had to flag her down, first, to get a menu, and then to order, and then to get a refill on my empty ice tea. After I asked her for an ice tea refill, she then actually went back over to the guy she was talking to and actually finished her story - before getting the refill.  She tried to force a couple smiles to save things once she knew we were not happy with her service, but mostly acted like she wanted no part of being there. We were finished, and then waited at least 10 minutes for her finally to ask if we needed our ticket. Then she gave us the wrong ticket.... These type of people do not belong as the main bartender - they can definitely ruin your business.  Tacos and 2 ice teas with tip (which honestly she did not deserve) was $40. Next time, I will go to Rubio's...

Number one animal style is excellent. Check the Internet for In N out burgers secret menu. Animal style is a mustard grilled patty with pickles and grilled onions. This burger has incredible flavor, and beats many high dollar burgers around town.  (Check my review for the Grind... ) Great shakes also - secret menu allows you to mix and match new shake flavors which is totally cool. You can't beat In-N-out for both flavor and value. And you can buy a cool In-n-out shirt for $8 - wear it proud!

After seeing this place getting glowing reviews from the show "Check Please", I decided to try it.  And I am sorry I did...  After sitting down at the bar, I asked if they could turn the tv on above the bar.  The bartender explained they were all out of order - ok, bad start... So I sat down next to a couple loud yuppies at the bar - who were obviously trying to let everyone know they were extremely successful... It was not working, boneheads...  Decided to order the BLT burger, which looked good on the tv show review.  The burger arrived on a skewer, about 8 inches high a nice thick tomato, lettuce, and onion making it stand that verticle. For presentation purpose, it is kind of neat looking.  But when you try to eat it, it is another story...  There is NO WAY you can get your mouth around this burger to eat it.  They onion was not cooked enough, and was so thick, you could not even bite thru it - it pulled out when I tried and I had to re-assemble... The bun was cold - it could have used a little toasting to hold it together. It eventally fell apart again - even when I mashed it down.  I ordered the burger medium, and it came well done, NO pink - it was defintiely over cooked.  No juices at all.  The Grind advertise the ultra hot oven - and cooking it in butter on a cast iron skillet adds flavor.  BUT, I have to say, there was basically NO flavor what so ever in the hamburger meat.  It was very bland.   The bacon on the burger was nicely cooked and was tasty, but the patty was not.  It could have definitely used at least some salt and pepper.    And if there were any around (there was not), I would have used some.... The so called char from the broiler did not add any flavor - more like burned fat - yuck...   I was quite dissapointed.  I will not return.  The burger was $12, and included NO fries, that would be extra... So wih my corona and my tip, I spent about $20 total.  I would have been happier driving thru McDonalds!   I kid you not, try the double double ANIMAL STYLE at in-n-out - it is 100% tastier than this place.  The burger at coach & willies also blows this place away.  For a place that specializes in burgers, and advertises that they have won awards for them, I was expecting to be wow-ed.  Instead, I was very disappointed.

Not sure if Mike Pulous still runs this place or not - but still has the same good food as the original on Central Ave.  Manager special is my fav - with 2 of the sauce choices on 1 plate of pasta- I got the meat sauce, and the brown butter/cheese sauce - a great combo.  They bring a nice warm loaf of french bread with your included chilled salad.  Add a glass of cabernet wine, and top it off with spomoni ice cream - and it is a great meal.  The bar is nice and large - and a great place to sit and have dinner if you are just a single.  The bartender is always pleasant and knows how to take care of you with great service.  I have been back a few times and have enjoyed consistant great food.  I hope this place makes it - I know the rent has to be high at Chandler Mall.  So I am going to do my best and eat there at least a couple times a month!!!  :)

Had a cheeseburger (coach &willie burger) with Swiss cheese, fries, and a blue moon. Burger was excellent - perfectly cooked, juicy pink in middle, cheese melted, and bun was great. Burger tasted like it was grilled over wood fire - great flavor.  Fries were perfect. Bartender was friendly and attentive. I have been there twice in a the last 10 days, and both times the food was excellent.  C&W will definitely be in my regular visits for dinner.

Ok, so I am officially updating my coach and willies review. My beautiful Alanna and I went for our one year anniversary. We had our first date their 1 year ago. Jessi waited on us - and she did an amazing thing for us by giving us an anniversary dessert on the house and wishing us happy anniversary - also she had the manager come to our table and wish us happy anniversary. It was a very special dinner for us. I had the Italian chicken and grilled vegetables and Alanna had the lobster mac & cheese. The dinner was delicious and when Jesse brought us our surprise anniversary dessert, it really topped off a great experience for our anniversary at coach and willies. We will be back - it was fantastic!

Great service, mobile - so they come to your business or house.  Great prices, great attitude, and tint is beautifully installed.  Bernice is absolutely the best window tint in AZ.  And also, they are happy to appreciate your referrals. Highly recommended.

Nice bar, good music, great tacos! Salsa with chips was good. Happy hr price of pitcher was great- dos Equis- was cold and mug was ice cold. I had the 3 fish taco selection of Baja grilled fish, ahi tuna, and crispy fish. They were all excellent - grilled probably the best. Orange cucumber salad ordered with tacos was a nice cool off to the spicy salsa. Total bill was $19 and well worth it. Very nice and upbeat atmosphere - but wondering about the open air design when summer rolls around in Gilbert with the cow dairies close by.... You know, flies may be a problem -but I guess they can always shut the windows. Nice addition to downtown Gilbert! I will definitely return to joyride!

Wow these guys are great! Repaired and upgraded with added rollers to my glass door in less than 30 min. My glass door barely was opening - it went from screeching to smooth as glass!  After he added silicon it now moves with the push of one finger!  Highly recommended!

Phillys is a fantastic sports bar. We went there on a Thursday night for Thursday night football between the Cardinals and the Vikings. The place was packed, but Tori, the best hostess in the world, found us a table within minutes. Phillys has the best selection of HDTVs I have ever seen in a sports bar with the television at every booth, and large HDTVs everywhere in the bar. They also have a nice patio with its own bar. The bar inside is large and accommodates many people. The food was fantastic. I had the Philly deluxe which included Angus beef, mushrooms, grilled onions, and Bell peppers. It had white and yellow cheese mixed in and melted on the thinly slice beef. It was without a doubt the best Philly cheesesteak sandwich I've ever had in my life. We will definitely go back soon.

Parking is tricky at first, but you can actually get fairly close to the theatre. Camelview Fashion Square shows small Indie films which is good. But $14 for a matinee??? Wow, that will not keep people coming back!!! You have to pick your seat. If a load nacho eater or talking kid is next to you, I guess you are locked into that seat??? Not good... I would definitely prefer to choose where I sit after I enter the theatre. I will not return mainly because of the assigned seating. Seats recline, but after 2 hours are not very comfortable. Harkins at Tempe Marketplace (Cine Capri largest digital screen in AZ) is still my favorite place to see a movie.
