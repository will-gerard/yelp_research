Was excited to take my girlfriend to vegas for the first time and booked a room at this hotel. I have yet to even check in yet and am already amazed how painful this experience is. I have been to Las Vegas a number of times before and I have never had to park my own car. Not only did I have to, the main lot and overfill lots were completely full. I had to park on the street roughly a mile a way in a less than ideal area of town behind the strip. I then hike into the hotel where I am greeted with a line resembling space mountain on a Saturday in July to just check in! There are 5 or 6 people working the main desk and I see a self serve kiosk so I attempt to use this. I walk over to see 3 of the 5 terminals are "out of order" and the two that do work require a credit card only, no debit is accepted. So I sit here in line writing this. Defiantly the worst experience I have ever had in Las Vegas. Haven't even seen the room yet! Let's hope for my sanity it is nice. Will edit this with results.

Great food with many different selections for any taste! Szechuan is hot! Just be advised. Bowls are a solid choice. As of this posting they have all menu items are $6!
