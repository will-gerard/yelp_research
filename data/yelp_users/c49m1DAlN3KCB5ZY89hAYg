Fun vibe. Drinks were well poured and not overpriced. Decor is fun and atmosphere is upbeat. Good for talking, but hit or miss if you are with a group.

If you need a place to return items purchased online this is the V. Secret to go to. Quick and easy with the efficiency of a secret agent.

Interesting items in the store. Varied selection of good quality clothing and accessories. A touch bit over priced, but not too far out. Someone takes time in selecting items to sell and it showed. A nice place to peruse.

I have been coming here for years and it only gets better! LOVE: Hot Chocolate and the Chai Tea any which way. ALL TIME FAVORITE: White Mocha Mindfreezer. If food ever made me happy this would be it. Overlooking the sugar and caffeine this is the best drink of all time. People are awesome, hours are fantastic, service is always good and best thing is that all of those things are consistent. Go. Here. NOW.

Executive Chef Chuck is one of my favorite people. So much thought goes into his cuisine. I have had many an item off the menu. The salads are the best in the valley. I now like beets because of the salad here. Drinks are Devine. Desserts are what dreams are made of. Happy hour is a hidden deal. Go here for a fantastic dining experience.

Man oh man. Ask and you shall receive. The place is an absolute delight. Have stayed here many times and will continue to. Great deals are the way to go. Every room is worth it. Hosted my 29 and 1/2 birthday party here. Upgraded room, complimentary drinks and food with personalized card. Make a connection with the staff and see great things come your way. Eat and much food as possible. The chicken quesadilla ordered from room service is my favorite quesadilla of all time. Book your stay in AZ here. Do it. Enjoy a boutique hotel that makes everyone feel like a celebrity.

Stayed here a few times. Reasonable price and nice special packages. Location is great. Staff was OK. Waited every time I needed something... Tooth brush, key that worked etc. I'm a local and could have answered the other guests questions of where to go or how to get somewhere faster than the front desk. Didn't really have an issue with noise and had good parking every time. Nice to have the shuttle service take us places and a late night pool fun!

I will be coming here again. As a lover of girly girl drinks this place was pure bliss! It does take extra time and a bartender who who how to do more than just pour. They are really making cocktails. Bartenders are super sweet too and have lovely personalities. Go here for a good time.

For my annual birthday party I create a themed scavenger hunt party. It takes places at various venues of Scottsdale. The only place I have repeated in the last three years has been firehouse. With excellent service this place is on the top for party planning. I work in community relations for a TV station in Phoenix with the mind set that communication is key and firehouse agrees. Other venues clam to have "marketing and pr" people, but firehouse is the real deal. They are so quick to respond it is amazing. Not only respond, but ask how they can make the experience memorable for the client. Refreshing that there are owners/managers in the venue business that believe pushing for excellence from a customer perspective. Justin and Brian and team have been an absolute pleasure to work with these past two parties and I look forward to working with them in the future. If you are looking to plan a large function in Old Town Scottsdale, these guys are some of the best.

My suggestion would be to have more hands on training with new staff members.  The person taking our order was obviously new and did not have mastery of the cash register. Unfortunately, that also meant that he did not have mastery of putting in orders as well. If a employee does not show that they are capable of executing their task, please do not let them do it on their own. It is the customers who feel the negative impact. I cannot eat the schmear that comes on a BLT with Avocado thin. Even though I put in my order three separate times, as that is how long it took the employee to input my order, I opened my sandwich to find the schmear on there. This condiment was on every part of the sandwich and I ended up having to through it away. The receipt did not reflect my request to not have schmear on the sandwich, which leads me to believe that even though the cashier repeated  "no schmear" back to me, he was unable to successfully put the order into the register.  As a result, I paid for a lunch I could not eat.

Since my first review I have come to LOVE this place. They always have everything, great coffee and tea and friendly staff.  Why I am changing my tune is because they helped me out when they did not have to. Trying to place an order early one morning for myself and my work team. 4 drinks and select bagels. Get the order in and low and behold when I move to the other register to pay, my wallet is gone. It had already been a rough morning as my car would not start and my hair would not cooperate.  What changed my day around was my experience at this store. At first they were going to give me one coffee for free as I was frantically looking in my purse for loose cash. Then before they could say anything more, I ran out of the store to look for the spare cash I keep in my car. After flying in and out of there like a mad woman, so relived I had found cash, my entire order was ready. Before I could explain that I had money in the car, the manager and team walked around and handed me my bagels and all my drinks. The lovely manager explains that he had already started the order before I realized my wallet was not in my purse. Although I insisted I pay he says, "Miss, we all have days like this and I couldn't let you leave without your coffee. Its on the house." THAT does not happen. In a world of me, me, me this man just helped another human being out. It was that simple. He had nothing to gain, other than my respect, his team's respect and the 10 other customers in the store's respect. Why I choose this one for my morning breakfast and coffee and tea is because I want to give my business where by business is appreciated, but also where the mentality is that customers come first and helping people with kind heart is a priority.

Pleasant dining experience. Honey seared chicken was light, hot and flavorful. Easy to get to. Seating was very much available. Staff were friendly with speedy service.

Thank you Hopdoddy for being you! Get the Turkey Burger! It's my new favorite! Yum to the last bite! Fries compliment nicely. Shakes are out of this world. Dining experience is cool. It always seems like it might take long, but it never does. Staff are super friendly and laid back. Visit if you need a juicy burger in your life.

I love this place. Unique vibe to Scottsdale. Selection of coffee and beer is admirable. Groovy staff. Fun game night and open mic appearances are worth a watch. Go here if you are cool or cool ironically.

Come for great food and excellent drinks. If you really want the Pilgrim pasty go during the week to guarantee that it's not sold out. Arrive before 8pm for more of a dinner feel. Oddly, my favorite Greek salad  is served here. I think I would eat everything put in front of me if it had their dressing. Service always pleasant. Perfect for and outdoor dining experience when weather permits. Take tourists here for a fulfilling meal.

New name same terrible management. I would be a stressed waitress too if there was no one to bus tables but me. However, give patrons a wait time or have them sign in. It was irritating to see a couple who arrived after us get seated first. Waiting is not a big deal, but ignoring customers is. Find someone who knows how to run a business and prioritizes customer service.

Gosh this place is cool. I wish more people knew about it. Warehouse with a community of businesses is a fantastic idea. Food, festivities and funky vibes check DeSoto Market out!

Live music. Check. Games. Check. Solid drinks. Check. All in all Valley Bar is worth the sketchy ally and sometimes cover. DJ's alternate so music isn't always my taste. 4/5 times the crowd is cool. If you go on an off night it just gets weird. Worth a roll of a dice and play cards against humanity.
