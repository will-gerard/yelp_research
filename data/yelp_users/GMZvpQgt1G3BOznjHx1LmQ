Yo so I came though here looking to get a breakfast sandwich and they sent me home with some sandwich that I cannot even identify being on their menu I was giving no receipt. I called them after using the number here and no one picked up the line. The sandwich  was covered in tomatoes which I am also allergic to. I'm not a happy camper as this one just so happened to be on the way that's out of the way. I managed to come back to settle what's happened and the Joseph  fought with me over the price difference which my intended meal was cheaper I've been told to come back and talk to the manager in the morning. They fixed my order but not how much I paid because " you didn't pay cash"  My hopes are not high...

I live 2 mins away I will come back when my orders wrong and have now 3 times, and today going back did nothing for me. I always get the same thing bacon breakfast with extra bacon and potatoes and that should ensure a bite with bacon every time. And when yall don't put extra bacon on it yall end up making me two burritos to replace the first. I DON'T WANT TWO BURRITOS JUST ONE WITH TWICE THE BACON. If I need to order extra extra bacon I'll start it's not about the price it's about the bacon!! Egg shouldn't be the most used ingredient if I'm asking for extra bacon. Ur too close for me to stop coming but please make my food so I only have to show up once

This place being "new" the only money spent to make is any better seems to have been all put in the sign on front. Unless your bowling maybe after reading the other review they might give a shit about you. I was waiting playing pool on the rest of my party and the music is so old and tasteless that I going to leave. The food might have gotten better but the lack of service makes me not want to spend another dime here. This place is worse then before in my opinion. Please make some improvements.  P.s. The lighting sucks for playing pool and it's over priced as shit!
