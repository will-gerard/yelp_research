Been a few times at various times for various reasons.  Food - 4/5 Love the bruschetta, sandwiches are good really no complaints, good alcohol selection.   Service - 4/5 I always receive good service.  Valet is always youthful.  Atmosphere - 3/5 Casual, great place for meeting friends. can be a little too busy for my liking.  Price - 3/5 Average I can't really complain.  Overall - I don't go out of my way to go here, but I certainly recommend it.

I love Firebirds. Its warm and cozy. I like to sit in the bar (until they changed it now there is just uncomfortable hightops with stools where there was a nice long bench seat with tables before)  or along the outside of the middle because it can get REALLY loud.   Food - 5/5 Really haven't had bad food here (only thing i haven't liked is the Sesame Chicken) I like grabbing the Soup and Salad for lunch with the BLT Salad and the Chicken Tortilla Soup.  Service - 4/5 Always good.  Atmosphere - 4/5 can be loud, but always a comfortable "log cabin' "winter resort' type feel  Price - 2/5 Price is a little high but this certainly isn't a Sizzler.  Overall - Try it out you wont complain.

This place isn't quite a full-fledge dive but it can smell funny, their beer selection is basically bud light on draft and whatever dusty bottle of domestic you want. They offer a menu with what they say is food... its basically deep fried whatever. They do have Karaoke, Pub Poker (pays $50 cash, I managed to win last time i was there and it was a nice surprise to leave the bar with more cash than i came in with.) and they have colorful collection of waitresses. They only have 2 pool tables and their bathrooms are small and awkward.

Good food, was here for a work lunch. I had the Miso Salmon Bento Box and it was delicious along with the Cucumber Salad. The prices aren't outrageous for lunches and they didn't appear to be busy so you can get in and get a table.   Views are amazing.

I have always been a fan of Papa John's Pizza, especially more than the other large pizza delivery chains. The quality of the pizza and prices were good and found it hard to complain. My opinion has started to change and I can say for a fact that I will never order pizza from the Papa John's at 231 W Thomas Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85013.  I generally order a thin crust pizza and more often than not and like today, the pizza comes cold and has the consistency of wet cardboard and what you would assume would be crispy is about as far from it as you can get. The past few orders have been messed up in one way or another. I've received plain wings instead of the flavor I ordered and I can't count the amount of times the driver has forgot and promised to bring back a 2 liter of soda but never come back to bring it.  There are too many great pizza places around me to bother ordering this consistently bad pizza, even for convince sake and I would suggest you do the same.

Food  - 2/5  Food was below-average at best. My steak tasted like it had freezer burn on the edges of the steak or like it had been microwaved. The side salad was good, I finished it but the veggie skewer was dry and the tomatos were old. My buddy did get the Southern Fried Fish and Chips (Catfish) and it looked pretty good and most everyone else at the table seemed satisfied with what they received and thats the only reason I gave the food any credit.  Service - 3/5 Waitress despite forgetting my beer was nice, she did use profanity when I mentioned she forgot my beer... I may have liked her more because of that tho.  Atmosphere - 3/5 Like most other "Texas" steakhouses it was loud but I could hear the other 6 friends I was with which was nice.  Price - 2/5 Based on the quality of the food I could have gone somewhere else and spend $20 for a ribeye and veggie skewer and been much happier. Drink specials were good and apparently they don't get much during the week because they have the big vinyl sign promoting 2 meals for $14.99 Mon - Wed.  Overall - You can find a better steakhouse in most strip malls, probably even the one Logan's Roadhouse is in...

Try this hidden gem. I haven't had the pasta yet but the pizza is amazing and have been told from friends the pasta is the same.  After talking to the owner last month he is suppose to start offering delivery soon.

Caminero replaced my favorite taco shop Bisteces a few years back, they changed the meat in the burrito and it wasn't quite as good, Bisteces probably had my favorite burrito and salsa ever.  Food - 4/5 Quality burrito, I get carne asada with avacado, cheese and sour cream and load up on the Tomatillo salsa which you can (and recommend you do) buy by the pint. You can tell when they get fresh made tortillas, the burritos are especially good on those days.  Service - 4/5 They get busy but the guys here are quick, helpful and polite.  Atmosphere - 3/5 If you eat at the restaurant it can get cramped I usually just grab a burrito and soda to go.  Price - 5/5 Cant beat a quality burrito for around $5.  Overall - Quick and delicious I'd recommend it to anyone.

I've been to the Garage a few times generally for a long lunch, they are usually pretty quiet and I can catch up on some e-mails while getting a quality craft beer. They don't serve the domestic swill so if you drink boring light beer continue on down to your local sports bar. I over heard the owner mention he didn't know what a Gastropub was until someone told him he opened one, he did a good job I enjoy frequenting his place.  The service is good, bartenders and servers make recommendations and I haven't been let down yet. The burger is quality and can't beat the price, I love the flatbreads and they always seem to have a good special at lunch. If you have a chance to have the chicken meatloaf sandwich give it a shot you wont be let down. People have mentioned and complained about service and I can say that this place can get busy especially during weekend dinner hours so if you're impatient, don't be, get a drink and enjoy yourself and the atmosphere and the weather, especially when the doors are open to the patio.  My only real complaints are the rear parking, its tight and limited, people who park out front consistently back into the poles, the rear entrance forces you to enter through a small smoking section that can be dirty and smell of smoke and if you sit in the booths there is a faint smell of tire as there are 3 hanging on the wall... but maybe that's just me.
