A good amount of meat on the pulled pork.  Crappy bun.  Sauce is good.  A few pieces of pork tasted like paper had gotten into meat.  The mac and cheese was crap, and so not worth 2.50.  My roommate loves BBQ so the idea of rubbing this one in when I came home backfired.    The take home message here is OVERPRICED!!!!

I went to this place about once a week with my roommate over the course of a year living here.  Always had a good experience with the exception of one girl there who has the personality of a mop.  I find it amazing that someone can see you dozens of times, even after waiting on you, will not even acknowledge your presence.  No head nod, no smile, just very unfriendly to the point of being rude.    Last night I went there for their anniversary with my roommate, and then another friend had joined me later on.  We ordered 2 chicken nachos from one girl.  After 20 minutes, I made mention that we still didn't have them.  Another girl said the order must have not made it to the kitchen.  Another 20 minutes had passed and I then told the bartender.  It took another 15 minutes on top of that.  Never ONCE did anyone bother telling me what happened.  No reason given.  Honestly, no one even gave a Sh*t either.  My buddy even commented on that after we left.  No one even cared.  Clearly the first person didn't put the order in.  The second..who knows.  No accountability what so ever!  I won't be going back.  I"ve worked in the restaurant business before for 4 years.  Never has any restaurant I've eaten at or worked for not went out of their way to make up for an error on their part.  No free beer on the house, no discount for the next time, no free nachos, no half off the nachos, not even god damn apology!  I'll never recommend this place to anyone as I have in the past.  And I did so fairly often.

Way overpriced.  There sub should be priced at 6.50 tops.  It's just okay at best.  Their pickle taste like its been marinated in salt.  The worse part about it was that my buddy wanted to go somewhere else but we went to this place on my suggestion.  Fortunately, there was no rift caused in our friendship.

I'm basing this on the owners lack of appreciation for his customers.  My buddy and I used to live in Tempe where there was a guy on University who made the best italian beef Chicago style.  Unfortunately, it is no longer there.  Since moving to Phoenix, we can't find a good one.  This one came very close, but the owners attitude sucks.  Furthermore, the guy charges 70 cents per topping which puts the normal toppings at 2.80 on top of the 8 dollars and change for the sandwich.  23 bucks for 2 of them.  This guy is crazy for charging such a price.  He definitely lost some business from us, especially considering we used to go 1-2 times a week at the last place.    The nail in the coffin was when my buddy said good bye on the way out and he just looked at us.  Unbelievable that you treat your patrons like that!  I'd rather give my business to someone else.

I really like their meatball subs. A bit annoying though with the middle meatball being in the middle where it either goes to one side or the other when you cut it giving you 2 on 1 side and 1 on the other.  Yep, a peeve of mine.  Haven't yet tried the other food.  Their mac and cheese sounds extremely tempting!

Called the other night to place an order and they didn't answer the phone.  That's not good, they wound up losing business. I told my roommate about it and he said that he called them on a Friday night to place a to-go order and they turned him down, said they were too busy!! That's incredulous.  I'm dumbfounded as to how you can turn away business like that.  So, basically, they lost my business and my referrals.

Tonight was the last night I got clowned by this place  I like a good Mac n Cheese and thought that I would go back on my word tonight to try it at this place.  I figured it would be good.  Man was I wrong!  First, it was a block 2 inches wide by a 5 inches long by 1.5 inches in height.  It didn't taste that good.  It was horrible if I"m to be honest.  The real kick in the crotch was that I was at the Lux not far from there and passed on their mac n cheese to try this places.  And the Lux's mac n cheese is way better!  Not just better but 7 dollars with bacon and jalapenos.  The size is a little more, too.

You look at this place from the outside and you wouldn't think much of it, much at all.  Actually, your subconsciousness would probably just have you look past it and not notice it at all.  But like my buddy's friend told him one day, look for the place that looks sort of run down with a lot of cars in front, they typically have the best food.  Following that advice, looking for food, we pulled a U-turn, went back and parked.  We were going to get take out until we heard the chips and salsa were free.  Budgeting and maximizing caloric intake, you know how that goes.  Place was hotter than all can be (the 2 a/c window units couldn't keep up), but we shrugged it off like the manly men we were and parked our arse.    The waitress was really friendly and helpful in explaining all the stuff they make, and the best part about it is that it's made fresh - chips, salsa, guac, etc.  This place is the real deal when it comes to mexican food.  It just goes to show you how most all places bend and give in, abandoning their tradition, just to meet the "needs" of the American people.  Or shall I call it ignorance?

When I arrived, there was people at the front desk so I walked around until one of the couples left.  When I approached, I stood in front a guy (Johnny) who had his head buried in the computer and without looking up at me, making any eye contact, he says, she can help you over there.  The inflection in his voice was as if to say, "I'm not going to help you, I don't care to help you, and can't you seem I'm busy with whatever I'm doing."  He reminded me of a disrespectful punk 12 year old kid being immersed in his gaming and blowing off his parents invite to join them at the table.   So, when he first said the other woman can help me, the couple was still standing in front of her.  I think they had asked another question, but regardless, they were still there.  He said it again with the same nasty tone.  At this point I barked back him telling him I don't care for his attitude, and second, I was standing right there, I'm fully aware of what's going on.  He said something under his breath to which I called him on it and instead of manning up, he lied and said she could help me, when he knows this isn't what he said.  I got into my room, the wifi wouldn't connect.  Then upon inspecting the bed I found 2 long woman hairs.  I'm like...WTF?  There is just no excuse for this.  I called down and complained about both.  She gave me a number to call for the internet which rang to no one.  I called back and was upgraded to an executive room.  Was nicer, but then after laying in bed chatting with my fiancee, I noticed another few woman hairs.  Again, WTF?  Obviously, this place does not wash their sheets.  And that is just foul!  I'll be making a major complaint tomorrow.  The only reason I would come back would be to teach this punk at the front desk the meaning of respect.

My roommate and I have been coming the Phoenix area, and others for an Italian Beef that rivals a place we went to in Tempe before it closed.  We found a couple that were decently close, but none that matched.    Came across this place by chance looking for something else.  Wasn't hungry, but when I saw the I.B. advertised, I made room.  I asked the lady how good it was.  She said, "You'll be back!"  Yeah....what else is she going to say, right?  Three days later, I was back and brought one home to my roommate.  Anticipating his reaction after the first bite, it was an ear to ear grin.  We finally landed on the moon!

One word:  Gluttonous  The fact that you can pile as much food into and far beyond the top of the bowl given to you is reason to start moving toward a 5 star rating.    In the land of opportunity where a person can stroll in and reward themselves for anything they like, usually just making it through the day without cutting your wrist, it's an American's dream.   It's sort of like a one time all you can eat buffet.  It's worth the price of admission just to see others work their magic while they pile on the food 6 inches or more above the rim of the bowl.  I believe there is an art to this master craft of self indulgence.  I was awestruck by this man who redefined the term, "the sky's the limit."    I will be going back this coming week to try and either 1)  break my own record set last week  2)  To match the height of the guy I saw on this last visit  or 3)  To eclipse his mile high feat and take this to a new level.  The next best thing about this place is that for 50 cents, you can purchase a box to put whatever you don't eat in and take it with you.  If this doesn't stir up the pig pen, I don't know what will.    Oink Oink

Arrived.  Was given ear pieces to listen to some audio.  After that, I was given some pages to flip through covered in plastic which....was the same thing in the video.  Twice?  Ok...  Then, I was told by the new girl to sit down off to the side and wait.  After waiting and waiting..about 45 minutes, I was called.  I was told by this girl that  the next I should just wait in line so they can see me.  Uh, but...I was told to sit  over "there."  The Diagnosis?  I got hosed by the new employee.  Too bad I wasn't compensated for every mishap this day because I could retire early.  I then went to this area where they proceeded to ask me questions about all of my tattoos. What it was, and what every color was present, etc.  Cause I guess if I get new ink they will somehow know was the premise and I couldn't give blood till a year after.  I wondered, do they do a cross reference every time you go there?  So I asked.  They don't.  So then how would the know?  Seems a bit much if you ask me.  Most people there donate because they need the money, so do they really think those people are going to be honest about drugs, sexual practices,...let alone that they got "new ink"?  Of course not, cause they need the money.  But hey, let's please the law makers shall we?  I went back to the exam room where the girl proceeded to go back over everything that I  just listened to and read before entering the room.  What the deuce?!  I'm now agitated.  I hop up on the exam table where I was given the most awful and incompetent exam.  When listening to my lungs, the person placed the stethoscope over my posterior deltoid and was off on the other side as well.  The posterior lobe...you would have thought was at my waist...ok, perhaps my flank would be more accurate.  My heart was auscultated over the middle of my left pectoralis muscle and so was the right side.  So much for that aortic and pulmonic valve.  She did at least make a decent palpatory effort when digging for an enlarged liver.    I then left the "exhaustive" exam and headed back to the chair.  After sort of not hearing the lady's instructions on where to go, I made my way back through all of the people who seemed like they were probably just at the DMV...you know that crowd?  yeah....so...I sit down and get stuck with that lovely 17g needle only to have it clot.  They did the other arm and it too clotted.  Thinking that I wasn't going to compensated in the tune of 45 clams was quite unsettling.  To throw more gas onto the fire, I was told by the one girl that since they didn't get any plasma, I would have to re register again because there was nothing to link me to - yeah...do it all over again.  You know that saying, "phuck that noise" ?  Yeah, it applies.  There was a light at the end of the tunnel, and it was not in fact a train with the roadrunner at the helm, but it was the fact that I did not have to repeat that agonizing registration and I did get paid.  I think I will try the other one on Broadway.

Good wing deals on wing night which is a plus.  Nice variety of sauces, and you can combine them which is nice.  Good amount of TV's for the games.  Service is spectacular.  However, if you are a non smoker and go there after 9pm'ish when the bar inside closes, you have to sit outside in the smoking gallery.  This peeves me, particularly if you have trashy loud obnoxious people sitting right behind you.  The smoke would be much less offensive if it were an open area, but it's roofed so it just lingers.  Grrr.

Place is pretty solid.  Good prices on beer.  Great wing prices.  Darts.   Photo hunt.  The only inconsistency is the service.  Once I went there and came in just before the happy hour ended and by time the waitress took our order, it was over.  She never bothered to just get the manager over ride the register, to which she acted as though was impossible.  Annoying and lazy.  Another time, the bartender completely forgot that she took a dollar bill and never gave me my change.  Even when I asked I her, she had no recollection.  I was left with the impression that she just took my word for it.  I've had much worse service don't get me wrong, but I have also had better.

Anyone who thinks this place has good gyros has not had a good gyro, and I feel bad for them.  Although, getting a good gyro is really not an easy task.  If you are ever in Seattle, go to Mr. Gyro's on Greenwood Ave and you will understand what a good gyro is.  This gyro had meat, tomato and onion.  That is hardly how you make a gyro.  Not to mention the Tzatziki sauce was awful.  The pasta salad was okay.  The lady taking the order -  how do I say this:  Not rude, but almost there.  Not friendly, but not rude, but not exactly chipper.    This is the kicker:  I saw they had a gyro with pasta for 6.50 (special), so I ordered a gyro. She asked me what side I wanted, so I had her say what the choices were.  She told me soup, pasta salad, fries, and steamed veggies.  So I chose the fries.  She then told me the total was 10 dollars and change.  I was like....what?  She repeated the total.  Changing gears and clarifying it wasn't my hearing that was in question, I asked for further details on why the price jumped 4 dollars with choosing fries instead of the pasta salad.  She told me the pasta salad was on special.  Still not believing this and that there must be more to it, I then asked if the gyro's were the same size, and she said yes.  At this point I was tempted to just cancel the order based on the logic of this restaurant in charging 4 more dollars for a difference between choosing fries vs pasta,and that the gyro was probably going to suck.  Once again I paid for not listening to my intuition!

Went there for the first time yesterday and I'll definitely be going back.  I had the super nachos while my buddy had the burrito, both were fantastic.  Their chips are awesome.  My only gripe there was no salsa; however, you can order pico de gallo and add their sauce to it.  There special on Tuesdays, Rock!  As for the comment about "being worried about the area", perhaps if you are alone at night walking, it might be a bit sketchy since there is a liquor store just across the street that tends to draw a certain crowd, but I would not let that deter me from dining here.  Besides, you are parking in the lot, not walking the streets.

I used to go to Pho Tanh until my buddy told me of this place.  At the time, I had already been unhappy with the poor unfriendly attitude of Pho Tanh.  I mean seriously, is it that hard to say hello to people, to smile, to greet them as you seat them?  These are your customers!    Well, Da Vang is definitely friendlier, all with exception of one of the ladies.  She's a grouch if I'm to be honest.  And I'm almost positive it was her that every single time I ordered and asked for whatever on the side (as in spiracha), she never got it right!  Happened like 6 times in a row.  Finally, I just bought a bottle from the store as to not deal with the incompetence.  I know...why wouldn't I check myself after the 3rd time, right?

There's only one nice lady there of the bunch.  The rest are unfriendly.  The same with the men.  There's one that is nice, the other is as rude and unfriendly as the one woman.    I've given this place enough forgiveness and it is time to pull the plug.  I'm never going there again.  The last time I went there, there was literally 7 people in there, and my food took 25 minutes from the time I ordered for it to-go.  The place has always been slow on delivery.    There is nothing worse than patronizing a place which is rude and does not appreciate your business.  I've experienced far better customer service and appreciation.  My recommendation to this place is be more friendly and appreciative.  We customers pay your bills.  I hope more people boycott your place.  Maybe that will teach you some manners.

Had their pizza, that was awesome.  It was one loaded up with stuff that I can't remember, but it was fab.  Went back tonight and was a tad disappointed in what came with the gyro platter.  Some good places that I've been to put a little medley of things, which it had but was just olives, and those green things that end in cini.  There's a place in Seattle that I have yet to find which compares.  These guys put rice, hummus, feta, olives, tzatziki, and a small greek salad on the side which you can make an awesome wrap with!  And there was more portion for the same price. The meat was good, and everything was good, but I won't order that again.  Seattle's ruined me.  If you are ever in Seattle, you must go to Mr. Gyro's.  I will confidently say that you will not find anyone who makes them better, if so, you got damn lucky!

I love Chili's having worked there for about 4 years in a past life, I grew accustomed to their menu, and Brownie Sundae!  of which is the absolute Bomb.  I think Chili's has some really good food for a chain restaurant.  Snazzed up the Chicken Sandwich the last time around.  Super good.  The Chicken Nachos are awesome as well.  Fajita's rock.  What is there not to like.

Went two days in a row for the Chicken Pho.  It was very good.  Chicken was tenders.  Broth was very good.  Nothing fancy about this place, just good food and nice people.  Still not sure if seat yourself or not.  You just kind of walk in and meander over to a seat and wait for them to meet eyes with you and then it just happens, the reciprocal head nod which says, yeah...have a seat right there.

Place lived up to the expectations.  Being a pizza and wing connoisseur, I was pleased on both ends.  The wings are a nice size too, no scrawniness here!   My buddy recommended the stuffed pizza and it was pretty awesome.  Although, I may have enjoyed the recommendation of the waitress more.  I think she recommended the deep dish.  Or was it the other one?  Damn lack of memory recall!  Ah...well, I guess that gives me another reason to go back.  The patio is pretty cool, too.  Had it not been so cold, I would have ventured out side.  Last but certainly not least, the waitress, Marie, was totally awesome.  She bumped it from 4 stars to 5!

First time I went in, I ordered a slice of pizza and then I had this feeling that they had to make a whole new pie for this.  I was bit annoyed that no one told me this.  I would think this would be a basic form of communication.  So once I inquired and realized this, I left because of time constraints.  I was going to write them off, but didn't.  I ordered tonight and got an 18" pizza for $9.95 and...(just walked to the fridge to check)...I DID order a half dozen wings but just realized that I ate about that many and still had some left over.  Nice.  Explains why the total was 20 bucks.    Wings were actually good!  To have a place make really good pizza AND good wings is a rare find.  I'm a wing connoisseur and there's only one place in BC Canada that I could not finish all 12.  The cooks actually walked out to see what fool ordered them :)  But this place actually makes them pretty hot (911).  Not scorching by any means, but I'll probably notice tomorrow sometime ;)  That's always the gold standard test for wings and if they make them hot.  Do you experience them twice?!

Just got off the phone with these people - John the owner.  For being an owner, you would think that the person would be more helpful in explaining what the process is in getting a poster made.    I'm helping a non profit organization and was trying to figure out what the costs were for different sizes.  After giving me one size he basically just assumed that I didn't know what I wanted because he never bothered to ask the right questions, nor did I really have the chance to explain.    When someone tells you, "why don't you figure out what you want and then call back." It tells me that I need to go elsewhere for better customer service.  Sorry John, that's why I was calling, to find out different costs which dictate what I want or can afford with the budget given.  Had you listened long enough, you would have learned that eventually I would probably buy 500 of various sizes.

Pricing is awesome compared to other places I've taken my dog.  People are friendly.  Never have had a problem.  Owner is nice.  I would definitely recommend taking your pet here.  Aside from all that, if something were to happen, they have a vet practice on site as well.  Can't beat that.

I still find the staff to be great. However, I chose to pull my dogs out because I don't like their mandatory Frontline that is required for flea and tick prevention.  If you read the ingredients which contains Fipronil, and Fipronil with Methoprene on the Frontline Plus, you can read about the toxicities inflicted upon the central nervous system by these products.  The package insert to these things always skew the facts.  If you do enough research, you can find a couple published studies with all the side effects. I included a link to a well documented study  This stuff is stored in the fat cells and it is released over about a mean avg of a 45 day period.  So then when your dog or cat grooms/licks themselves daily, they are ingesting this orally which is more toxic.  Most diseases are a result of cumulative build up of toxins, whether you are a human or animal is of no difference.  People don't see the results of their bad choices and thus they think there's no harm.  It would be like smoking a cigarette and then arguing that because you can still breath it's not causing any damage.    Using this stuff month after month simply is not wise, nor healthy for your animal.  There are other more simple and natural things you can do for your pet.  And having two dogs that I took there adds up when you are shelling out extra cash every month, for a poison none the less.  And as a medical provider, health always comes first and thus it is my obligation to educate the public about unknown carcinogens.  http://freedownload.is/pdf/safety-of-fipronil-in-dogs-and-cats-a-review-of-literature-6640434.html  http://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2011/07/14/are-you-exposed-to-this-carcinogen-when-you-pet-your-dog.aspx  http://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2012/05/04/flea-and-tick-control-tips-for-pets.aspx  On a different note, I brought my dog there for a foot injury.  I requested x-rays be done but after examining the dog, the doctor said he didn't feel it was necessary as he didn't think anything was broken.  In this day and age, with overhead expenses to meet, it is always refreshing when people can think beyond the almighty dollar.  They could have easily charged me for an unnecessary x-ray.  Kudos for that.

This place is awesome.  3 dollar import beers on tap?!  5 dollar wings, and really good tasting wings at that?!  A hospitable bar manager by the name of Dan got our drinks and took our order.  He's a long time patron of the joint who's known the owners for a while and he's on board now looking to make some changes for the better.  So I'd say that if anyone rated this place 3 stars or below, you should definitely check it out again.  Not sure what isn't to love about this place.  When good people and affordable food and drink culminate together, it's a 5 star dealio.  Oh, and the dart board with pool table is definitely a nice touch.  The only other thing that would float my boat more so would be if they got Photohunt !!    ADDENDUM:  They DO have photohunt.  How could I miss it!  Yeah, I'll definitely be back at this place!

Place is pretty awesome.  Nice and laid back crowd.  Been there twice now.  It gets kind of loud in there.  I didn't realize that I was somewhat "yelling" to have a conversation with my friends there until I woke up at my buddies after leaving tore up from their delicious white chocolate beer and he said that my sore throat was from talking so loud to be heard.  Yes, the deducing agent would be that his throat was sore as well.  I'll definitely be back, although next time, less white chocolate beer.  Man is my body just aching today!

I called to find out how much their happy hour price for beer was.  She didn't know.  (She only works there)  She then said their half off.  Another person comes by who she asks and they didn't know either.  At this point I'm thinking....seriously, is the younger generation these days this clueless?  After being put on hold, she says 4.00.  So, normally the beers are 8.00?   I don't know, but there's too much confusion for me to give this place a try.  Good luck.

Is it 5 stars as good as it gets for a gym?  No.  But keeping this review in context to what it provides, it is 5 stars.    1)  It's AFFORDABLE!  10, 15, or 20 bucks a month depending on which option you choose.  I went with the basic as it's all I need.  But if you drink a lot of stuff from the cooler, I would definitely go with the 20/mo.  2)  It's clean  3)  Has showers  4)  Offers enough stuff to get a good work out   I like the fact that it doesn't have a flat bench and dumbells over 80#, it deters all the "muscle heads".  I'm just here for a work out, not a spectacle.     Furthermore, if you can't figure out ways to use a dumbell and the other equipment to tone your body, then not sure what to tell you.  Herchel Walker just does situps, push ups and I think dips/pull ups and he's ripped.  You don't need a huge gym unless you're in competitive body building.  In their defense, a sign up fee is not a membership, nor is it a contract, so they are accurate in their advertisement.  Just because someone only wants to work out there for one month and is unhappy with a cheap start up fee doesn't make it a "scam".  10 dollars a freaking month.,  Some people in this world think everything revolves around them.  ADDENDUM:  I have to say their policies are a bit weak. No bandana's?  I'm knocking off a star.

Went back to this place.  Internet was still awful.  Can't watch any videos.  Mocha is really good.  But they lost a customer for good.  You're a coffee shop, and people come here to study.  If you can't provide adequate internet, then that's a problem, and a foolish one on the owners behalf.

My review is based on the U2 concert that I attended a couple weeks ago. Definitely is a nice stadium.  The surrounding area is pretty awesome.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Pitt.  If you are a Steeler fan, it definitely seems like a great town to be in.  Found the people in the city to be more than cordial  and friendly.  Would definitely go back to this city to visit.

I only go for the oreo chocolate cookie shake and half the time I go there, their "machine is down".  I called when I got home to ask the question I didn't when I drove off aggravated, "why the hell is your machine down all the time?"  However, no one answered the call.  Nice.  Lost my business.

I used to frequent this place like 2 or 3 times a week.  Then one night I call up and it rang for 2 minutes. No one picked up.  I hang up and call back.  After about 30 seconds the owner picks up and I tell him who it is and what I want.  (he knows me from all the business I give him).  He tells me that they close at 730.  It was 7:29, plus the fact that the phone was ringing for a couple minutes..there was no reason I should not have my order taken.  The biggest factor was my repeat business I gave this guy.    Bottom line:  I will never be back to this place.  Don't ever give anyone your business when they don't appreciate your business, particularly when they snub you before they even close!

Went in there to check it out being a nacho connoisseur.  I was severely disappointed.  For the price paid the good delivered, it was awful.  You can drive a little down the road, not much to Pepe Taco Villa or the Sun Up and get way better chicken nacho's.  And Sun Up has 5 dollar happy hour all day on Sunday for their drinks and food.

I called for the price and was told 8.95. A bit skeptical due to the low price.  I mean, seriously? Ok, so I went on yelp to read the reviews.  I read through the review and felt pretty comfortable.  Although, there was one which talked about a roach and showed a picture.  At first, obviously a bit unsettling, but lets face it, where is there a place that has food which does not attract roaches?  The question was, is the place disgusting inside or unsanitary?  I thought I'd go see for myself.  Place was clean.  Temp was good.  I only ad the sushi and it was moving off the table pretty fast as there was ample amount of people getting sushi.  I think the place is busy enough that their food doesn't stick around that long to spoil or incur issue.  There was a person that mentioned going there at a certain time could affect this temperature issue, I think he mentioned later on.  Not sure.  But during lunch when I went, everything looked and tasted good.  My body feel fine.  Service was good and friendly.  A very wide selection of stuff to choose from.

Good beers on tap.  Solid pub grub.  Happy hour shaves off a few bucks and makes it what it should be otherwise.

First, the lady who works there was very nice.  It's nothing personal, but the lamb tasted more like beef than lamb.  And the lamb was in chunks, not thinly cut where it is customary.  I'm a gyro connoisseur, so I can tell you that this is the first place I've ever been to where it was in chunks.  Ruined the mouth feel of it. Tsiki sauce is okay, not the best.  Sorry, but whoever says this is the best gyro or lamb souvlaki hasn't had good Greek food, and I feel sorry for them because they are missing out.  If you want a good gyro, try the Persian Garden Cafe on Thomas road, then tell me this is the best there is.  If you are ever in Seattle, you have to go to Mr Gyro if you want the best of the best.

Definitely good sushi.  I think sometimes an all you eat has a stigma of "must not be that good of sushi", but I would say that's not the case here.  Actually, I saw one of the guys who was making the sushi cut into an avacado, and I guess there was something about it he didn't like so he threw the whole thing away.  Heck, I think I would have at least looked further to see if there was some part that was good.  So point being that they don't pass off bad food.  I'll definitely go back if I'm in that area.  Personable people to boot.

The food was outstanding.  Had the Chicken Curry with Naan Bread.  The only thing that ruined it was the obnoxious brat sitting across from me which I finally had to ask him myself to be quiet because I was trying to enjoy my meal.  Mom was a bit pissed with an evil eye.  My thoughts are, if you can't control your kid, then stay home!  Or at the very least, have some common courtesy and common sense to extricate your child from the scene.

Drug use must be rampant in Tempe, or perhaps, there is a direct correlation between those who are high and those who review George's Famous Gyros on Yelp.    There is absolutely nothing good about this gyro except the quantity of meat.  There is essentially a pinch of lettuce, tomato and onion.  The sauce is there, but without much taste.  I've had better food at the ball game.    I think I will quit med school and just open up a gyro shop because apparently there is no competition since no one in Tempe knows how to make a gyro.  I guess all the Greek paraphernalia is analogous to an incompetent doctor with a great bedside manner, just because you look the part doesn't mean you are going to deliver in the end.

They get a 5 star review for 2 reasons:  1.  Their subs/sandwiches are awesome.  They are priced well.  2.  They appreciate your business.  I enjoy giving my money to people who run their own business and appreciate their customers.  Seems to MIA these days.

Gave up on this place.  A man can only take enough of supporting a place with his hard earned economic dollar to be around unfriendly staff people.  The last time I went there they screwed up and didn't put in our order which made myself and 2 friends late to our engagement.  They lost 3 customers that day.    Honestly, it just goes to show that you can not even say hello to people, be grumpy and unfriendly, but if you have good food that has little competition around, people will still support you.  It really is amazing.  However, not this guy...not anymore.

Love Q-dobes chicken burrito.  The rice was a little undercooked today, but it still was delicious.  Staff was very friendly.  Place was clean.  Just not much else to report, would go back.

Ever go to a place, but just before you pull in you have this gut feeling that you should just keep driving?  Yep, that's this place.  However, I had mixed signals because I had been there before, just once.  But it wasn't until I actually parked that I realized it.  However, I still didn't know WHY though.  I order a chicken burrito and then when I got it, BAM! The light went on.  The size of the meal...the BANG FOR THE BUCK!  That's why I had the gut feeling!  Needless to say, I felt like that kid in the movie, "The Christmas Story", who day after day ran to mailbox to check for his package.  Finally, upon getting it, he fills out the mysterious code which turns out to be nothing more than some stupid statement telling him to drink more Ovaltine?!  Well, that's how I felt upon walking away with that measly burrito for 8 bucks! - Like a sucker.   After sitting down in my car, I said to myself, HELL NO!  I'm not going to get jacked for 8 bucks for a POS burrito.  So I went back in and got my money back.  People are insane charging what they do for such skimpy portions.  Well, to the recent poster....there might be a reason why it's never crowded when you go in there - grimace proportions!

This place rocks.  I love the bowling alley setting with the pool tables and two bars up front.  The connection to the Gypsy bar is fab.  The arcade is a great touch.  And the service is pretty fantastic.  The attitude of their employees is very personable which I like.  I hate going to a bar where the people just put your drink down and don't ever say a word.  I can sit at home and have a better conversation with my dog.  No seriously, my dog speaks on command.  Sounds something like rooo-ooohhh-oooo. And she changes it up, too.  It's much more entertaining than most places around town.  Lucky strike is definitely a great find.

Been here several times now.  Always good service and a positive experience.  The places is clean.  The food is great and at a low price.  Being a med student, it definitely helps with the budget.  That's probably the main reason I keep going back, well....and it tastes awesome.

Definitely a nice go to on Sunday morning.  Greek omelet was good.  My buddy had the scrambled eggs and the other stuff with it.  Both enjoyed it.  Would go back if the prices were a bit lower, but I think $9.29 for an omelet and toast is just a bit much.    I saw some old people sit down and then eventually leave.  I think they didn't realize it was order off to the side, take a number, and then wait for them to bring it out to you.

$9 freaking dollars for a philly cheesesteak that is about the size of an old dollar coin?  Save yourself the money and go to Chicago's Taylor Street just down the road on Rural and Curry.  A bit shorter but way thicker, all for 5 bucks!!  These people lost their minds charging what they do.

I went back after my initial review and gave the place a second chance.  Frequented there often because I found their wings to be awesomely hot.  After going there ALL the freaking time, I ordered wings (2 dozen) which were basically not hot what so ever.  I called and long story short, they gave me a 3 dollar discount.  Had I known that was what was given, I would have had them deliver another order and pick up what was left.    What really irritates me is that when I call up and find this out, the girl basically just says that there's nothing SHE can do.  And then just leaves it at that.  Well how about getting someone on the phone who can?  What a concept!  I mean, I know it's just short of rocket science, but come on!    Then, the manager comes on the phone.  I ask if she worked yesterday, and her reply is, "what day is it today?"  WTF?!  Seriously?  People are absolutely effing clueless!  So begins to tell me that she doesn't have the authority to do anything else.  SHE doesn't.  Well who the heck does?  Maybe..just maybe we should contact them?    I find it extremely aggravating when you have to problem solve your own issues with a company because the employees are dumber than a box of rocks!  Do you have one brain cell that is functional?  This place sucks.

As I write this I sit here enjoying one of their delicious dishes.  I was here for the first time several weeks ago and their chicken pizza and spanikopita were awesome.  The owner remembered me which is always a nice touch.  But what I like most is that he walks around and personally greets everyone to see how their experience is.  That's top notch! Having a new dish today which is incredibly tasty as well.  And the food is high quality, with fantastic tasting water.  So nice to not have to buy a bottle of water these days just to get a basic necessity of life!  And last but not least, the service is always great.

Was there on a Sunday afternoon.  Not a bunch of people there at the moment, but I can tell this place probably throws down on a weekend night.  They have all the fixins for a good time - photohunt, darts, billiards, Mrs. Pacman/Galaga.  Only had a beer so I can't comment on the food.

Definitely an awesome buffet.  Not your typical buffet stereotype.  Love the sushi.   Great variety of things to have.  If memory serves,  it was 19.99 when I was there.  I think a tad high, but someone mentioned 25 bucks, so maybe it's come down :-?  Sake is priced well, and the beers.

I think the friendliest person is the bartender, whatever her name is.  The rest are there for a paycheck, and probably think that they should get a good tip because they have skimpy clothes and most guys are desperate and fawn all over them.  Nothing worse than self-entitlement.    People go out for entertainment.  And part of your job as a waiter/waitress is to be outgoing, to socialize.  The couple of girls that waited on me seem lack this skill.    The most annoying thing about this place is the "We ID everyone regardless if they are on an oxygen tank, in a wheel chair, full head of grey hair, more creases and wrinkles than a Sharpe (dog) and wearing a World War I hat."  Seriously?  How stupid.  I'm not going back simply because of such stupidity.  Next is their over priced beers.  $5 dollars for a 16 oz beer?  Ridiculous.  There's TONS of places that have more to offer than this chain on both beer and food, and at a better price.  If you want an awesome variety of beers, check out the Whining Pig or Pigs Meow.

Went there with a buddy of mine during the late afternoon.  Service prompt as we sat at the bar and it was just us and another patron at the bar.  Wings were good and beer....tasty.  I'd go back.  Actually, me and my buddy did but they were closed for renovations.

Been back twice now.  Definitely a fan, and hooked.  90 min for 45 dollars is worth everything associated with the trip to and fro.  I've seen Lisa both times.  Girls got some strong hands, and she'll put the hurtin on you if you need it.

This place is good.  They have specials every day on beer and food.  Tacos are awesome.  Fajita's are stellar, and loaded to the max with meat.  Staff is friendly and cordial.  Definitely my new favorite place!  Prices rock.

I went there tonight and had their wings and burger.  Both were awesome.  I always get my wings extra crispy and very hot with blue cheese.  They didn't have blue cheese but I reluctantly ordered anyhow.  The wings were neither crispy or very hot.  The set up was perfect for a disaster.  As it turned out, the garlic ranch was pretty awesome, and the wings fell off the bone.  They were extremely tasty as well.  Needless to say, quite a nice surprise.  The burger was fantastic as well.  Not a huge selection of beers, about 5 in total but the pumpkin kilt lifter and IPA were good.  Bartender actually was there for more than just a paycheck which is odd these days.

Good Pho.  But $11.95??   Good lord.  I wish I had looked at the price before hand, but given that every other place I have eaten Pho (and that's a lot) comes in under 8 dollars, didn't think I needed to.  Lesson learned.

Went there because I'm new in town and  I'm a chicken wing, pizza and gyro connoisseur.  They have all 3 there.   I ordered a gyro ($4.50 alone or $5.00 for the combo) and wings  ($7.95).  The total came to $15.95 so I stopped the guy and mentioned this. He said the 2 sides of blue cheese was 1 dollar a piece!  I was flabbergasted.  I mentioned that NO WHERE have I ever been would they charge you 1 dollar a piece!  And they were small sides (1 heaping t-spoon).  I would pay 75 cents for a side at Genos's in Tempe for 3 times that amount of BC (needed for big orders).  Get this though, the guy will charge you 50 cents for substituting blue cheese for the regular side of ranch - because it cost more.  Seriously, 10 cc's of blue cheese is something that is too much to include with meal as every other plae that I have ever been to will?  Needless to say I cancelled my order.   I wonder, was it really worth it for him to lose that business, AND future business?    As I was driving home, I thought about the 50 cents increase for the special.  I chose a can of coke instead of the fries.  But here's the math:  By his logic, the two small sides of blue cheese cost more than 4 cans of coke or 4 orders of fries (0.50 X 4  = the $2.00 for the sides of BC).  Crazy.  I may go back for the gryo because it's on my way to school and back, and just around the corner, and it wasn't bad.  In a pinch will hit the spot, but it won't be regularly I can tell you that.  He could have had a customer a couple times a week and one that bought more than just a gryo being that I love wings and pizza as well.  Not just that, buy my roommate and I tend to eat out at the same place.  The guy definitely needs better business sense and customer service appreciation.  3 stars for the gryo 1 star for the blue cheese charge

A 12 ounce beer (minus 2 oz for the head) served in a plastic glass is a bit absurd.  Charging 5 dollars on top of it!?  More absurd.  I won't be back.

Food is very good.  But the owner is even better.  Super nice.  Fully appreciative of your patronage.  I don't know if you knew it was my first time or not, but she brought me out complimentary rice and an egg roll.  I thought that was extremely nice of her.  I'll definitely be going back.

Went there for my first time with my roommate and a buddy with his girlfriend.  When I got my ribs, I was expecting them to near fall off the bone, however, they did not.  I usually go to Outback as I like the soften of their meat and the ease at which it comes off the bone.   Now, there are others who really like their ribs, but for me, it just wasn't what I was expecting, so if you are expecting an outback type ribs, you will be disappointed.  But again, this is only my opinion and you may just love them like many others do!  The sauce is really good, I can say at least.    But this is what sets this restaurant apart from many others, and that is how they handle an unhappy customer.  The owner took the ribs off my bill, offered me something else, then brought me a complimentary side of chili/beans which were very good.  And then he brought out table a dessert to share for free.  To me, that would make me come back to try their pulled pork, which my roommate enjoyed.    It's rare these days where you find owners really appreciative of the patrons business, and that's something that I fully value as a customer.

People are incompetent and rude.  Asked for seaweed salad and then afterwards would have the yaki udon.  So they bring the main entree minutes after she brings the seaweed salad, regular salad and miso soup.  Who does this?  No common sense.  So the entree sat getting cold.  No apology.  No follow up to see if everything tasted good.    When I got to the entree, there were 2 brocolli stems each with 2 and 3 small stalks.  It wasn't even a full bulb, let alone there being only 2.  Then, there was about a few slivers of carrot and cabbage.  It was ridiculous.  So needless to say, I wasn't going to pay for that.  I brought it up to the guy behind the counter, and he was incredibly rude and unhelpful.  He refused to walk to the back and get the lady so that I could discuss it with her.  I would not recommend this place.

Definitely worth going to.  I love the fact that they have gluten free crust option.  And the amount of toppings you can put on is awesome. I've been there a couple times and there was a simple error or confusion, which is understandable since they just opened, however, every time they are offering a free beverage and the last time they made a mistake with the pizza and instead of throwing it out, they gave it to me anyhow and redid the pizza.  Pure awesomeness.

Ok, this may seem harsh but first off....if you open a store, there should be some basics in place.    1.  I though the ambiance was rather flat.  There's just nothing "going" on.  I don't think there was any music playing, if so, it wasn't noticeable.  No TV's.  Nothing to keep you busy.  I'd recommend one of those bar boxes with the games.  A TV.  Music (turned up a little).    2.  6 dollars for a draft...on Indian School and 24th st?  I'd expect that in Scottsdale.  I've had quality beers, and can appreciate a fine crafted beer, but I can't stand places that charge 6 dollars for a draft beer, even Scottsdale.  And no, it has nothing to do with being cheap, it has to do with price gouging.  The mark up is outrageous.  Sun Up has quality drafts at much more reasonable price.  3.  The menu is horrible.  3/4 of a menu of cheese?  It's not a wine bar.  This was a horrible decision by whomever.  Beer increases appetite...enough said. Panini and beer?  Good lord.  I understand working out the kinks, but as it is, I see this place closing if it stays the same.  The one reviewer writes "great concept..."  What is the concept?  Serve beer, have tables, and offer cheese?  Hmm. Ok.    I see this place as being greedy.  It's over priced.  They clearly want to serve food that doesn't require a kitchen so that they can keep the cost of the establishment at a bare minimum.  This tells me they could care less about the customer service and just expect to get people to come there and pay inflated prices for beer and a sliver of cheese.  Sorry, but I'll pass.
