Was very good, non greasy and healthy.  A great choice.  Service was fast and friendly.  We sat on the patio with outside temperature at 59 degrees but with the patio heaters was perfect for a nice Sunday morning.   I had the Rocky Mountain Omelet which was the perfect amount and was delicious.

Met a good friend here for lunch.  The place is a nice little meeting spot.  The food was delicious.  I had the Chicken Taco Salad.  Price is reasonable and the staff was great.

Downtown Chandler was having the Jazz Festival and the after party was Kokpelli.  This was my third visit and I was a little apprehensive as the last two visits were way less than acceptable.  They had jazz music which was excellent.  We decided to try the food.  The was actually pretty good.  The Sea Bass was a little oily but what do you expect for 15.00 sea bass.  I was actually feeling like it could be a good visit, but the customer service there is horrible.  The waiter loses interest after about two trips to your table and then just seems annoyed you are still there.  It is a little strange for a wine bar to be rushing people out.   I would give them a B for the food and an F for their service.  They really need to work on it, as it was the service issue I had experienced on my previous two visits.  If you are a small local establishment developing good customer relations is critical to your success.    Wine- We had the Chardonnay Reserve, when we arrived we ordered by the glass and it was actually pretty good, so we decided to get a bottle.  The bottle was tart and undrinkable.  If you drink wine you know when something is off with your wine and every bottle is not always the same.  We tell the waiter and he says you have been drinking that all night and left the bottle on the table.  The bottle sat full when we left with two full glasses.  This is really horrible for a wine bar and no I will not go back.  The atmosphere is very nice actually, and it has an awesome location in downtown Chandler.  I hope in the future they fire all their staff and start over..

We visited The Living Room after a bad experience at Kokopelli.  This was my first visit.  The energy, music, decor and customer service is above average.   The kitchen was closed so we will return and check out their menu very soon.  This would be a much better choice if you are looking for a wine bar in Chandler.
