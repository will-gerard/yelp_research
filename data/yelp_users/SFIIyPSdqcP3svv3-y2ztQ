Is it possible to give no stars?? Terrible!! Took my 5 month old there on Christmas Eve since his dr was closed. He had what to me looked like hives but I just wanted to double check. We were the only people in there.. It took dr. Cooper 40 minutes to see us, even though he was sitting outside the door typing on his computer. I asked when we would be seen, he had the nerve to tell me 5 more min your next.... Uh I'm the only person here!? When he came in to look at the rash he didn't touch my child to examine the rash or anything... Well it doesn't look dangerous.. Waste of my time. Don't pay him your co pay

I'll start out by saying if I could give 0 stars I would. I had previously been told that Jos A. Bank had some pretty good deals and it was worth checking out for my upcoming wedding in September. Made my appointment online, got my confirmation email. Confirmed my appointment. All is good right? WRONG. My fianc√©, sister in law and two groomsmen show up at 11:20 for our 11:30 appointment to not being greeted and asked what do we need. When I let the woman know we had an appointment at 11:30 she Rudely asked me for how many and said that she was the only here. Asked me for my group number, I got my email out and she apparently couldn't read it. One of our groomsman has a service dog, who barked. The lady had literally rolled her eyes and acted so annoyed that we were in the store. She then proceeded to show me the small rack of what colors they had. Didn't bother to ask me what colors I was looking for, when my wedding was, what style we were thinking. Says, here look. Turns around walks away and proceeds to try and talk about the service animal and dogs. Doesn't even ask us ANYTHING about tuxes. After 5 mintues I told her we were leaving now and going somewhere else. She literally said well there is another Jos A. Bank down the street. Thanks lady! I'm already standing in one, why do I need to go down the street??????  My advice, don't waste your time. Go to men's wear house and have someone who likes their job help you. Oh and I called later to ask for a manager... One of the salesmen said hang on I'll get her... Low and behold the woman who answered the phone was the SAME woman who wouldn't help us at our appointment. This company needs to really look into they hire for management!!!!
