Food good. Waitress good. Bouncer however, very rude and looked like he wanted to fight us. Came in with a VALID green card and they said they didn't accept it because it didn't look like the green card on their picture. Terrible argument because a lot of people's ID's didn't look like the picture in front either. But that's fine, I said I wouldn't drink and they let me in with a mark on my hand. It was getting late and my little brother who's 12 years old started dozing off. Bouncer came and told him "wake up or I'll kick you out!". Somebody needs to educate these people on the law and how to properly talk to the customers. Never going back here again.

Talk about going above and beyond. These guys really took care of me and my car. Before going to Vision Collision, I went to 3 different places to get estimates but leaving my car at those places didn't feel quite right. At Vision Collision I felt very assured that my car would be taken care off. Sure enough, it was. Not only did they fix my broken bumpers but also restored my headlights for no extra cost. I definitely would be going back here if I need to. They have my highest recommendation.

Todd and his team has done it again! I went in due to recommendation from another mechanic that I needed to replace my entire clutch after he replaced my master and slave cylinders. The clutch would have cost me an arm and a leg so I went to Todd because I knew he would offer the fairest price. Here's where Todd saved the day and my bank account. Any other mechanic would have been glad to just swap out my clutch and get their money but not Todd. He took it upon himself to figure out if the clutch was actually bad or if it's something else. With the help of his team, he found that the only thing wrong was the master cylinder that my other mechanic installed. It's safe to say I'm not going back to that mechanic again and I'm sticking with Todd and his team. Thank you for all you do Todd! I look forward to doing business with you again.
