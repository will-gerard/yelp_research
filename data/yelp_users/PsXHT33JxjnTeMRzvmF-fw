Ooh my goodness! The food? Delicious. The service? Fantastic. Sangria? Yes please!  I ate here with the family for my mom's birthday. We all had a bunch of items from the happy hour menu and were stuffed.   The only thing that could be improved is if they let the sangria soak a bit more. The fruit tasted like it could have used a couple more hours in the mix.   Other than that, I can't say anything bad about it.

I wish I could give it a half of a star.. The only thing they do "right" is that they make some kind of drink for you.  It's probably not going to be what you ordered, but I guess there's always the option of going back, waiting in line for another 10 minutes, asking them to remake it, getting a dirty look about it, then finally getting it back 5 minutes later.  Who wouldn't want to do that...?  This is the closest location to my house; however, it is the LAST one I would choose to go to..  : /  The set up is semi inconvenient, but I don't really go at the rush hour times of day, so I can't comment on that aspect.  SOME of the baristas are nice, but out of the 30 times I have gone there, I think my drink has been made correctly 6 or 7 times.  That kind of inaccuracy is not what I would expect from anywhere, much less such a well known company like Starbucks.  But on the other hand, I don't HAVE to go to this location, it's just the most convenient, so I guess I should just suck it up and drive to a different location- like the one inside Desert Ridge.  I've never had a bad experience there.
