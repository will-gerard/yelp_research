Late afternoon dinner at the Palm... I wanted to leave when we were not received for about 10 minutes, but we gave them some time to realize there were customers up front. After someone in the kitchen finally noticed us, we were seated at a table, with no menus... Then, our waiter introduced himself, took away extra silverware, and gave us no menus. We asked... Should we get out own menus? He said he would get us some. He then proceeded to chat with some waiter buddies in plain view. Since the restaurant was almost completely empty, it looked like we were interrupting a break. After several minutes of chit-chat, the waiter finally delivered some menus (how hard is that?). Perusing the menu, it was clear the Palm doesn't believe in meals, which I guess is because meals are... gauche. You can order a steak for $45, but you won't get a salad or a side unless you buy a separate $8 plate of veggies or $8 salad. I just couldn't believe a 9 oz. piece of meat would be worth that much (plus, I'd rather a 6 oz. filet). So, we ordered the Veal and Chicken Parm. (~$35), which do not come with any noodles unless you pay $4 extra (thus bringing the Parms. up to ~$40). I also ordered a coffee, which was just OK, and asked for a bread basket, which was room temperature and less enjoyable than the Mimi's bread basket. On the plus side, the entrees were excellent, and had there been half as much Chicken Parm., a vegetable, and some well-prepared noodles or potatoes, I wouldn't have felt so ripped off. As is, two chicken breasts was way too much chicken and too little fine dining. In addition, the lighting in the restaurant was not very romantic/intimate, and there was a noticeable lack of ambiance. We managed to escape from the restaurant for $110 total (no salads, no desserts, no alcohol), for a meal that was less enjoyable than many $60 meals ($30 per person) we've enjoyed at other restaurants (with at least 1 salad, 1 dessert, and 1 glass of wine). If someone else had been paying the bill, I had ordered the lacking sides, and I had never seen the price, I may have had a better experience, but the service and ambiance still were nothing to write home about. (Hi, Mom!)

Teriyaki chicken with soba noodles! That's what I get every time... It's pretty darned good for a fast food Japanese place in a mall! The food is cooked up on a big grill in front of you (with a bit of performance usually thrown in by the cooks ~ "yummy, yummy chickeeen!"), so depending on the rotation of the chicken, you may have to wait 10 minutes or so for the chicken (or steak, I guess) to cook up. That's fine, as it's worth the wait for fresh food. The teriyaki chicken comes with some traditional veggies ~ bok choy, I think ~ and a very light sauce. However, they do use some vegetable oil, so don't expect this to be the lightest meal you've ever eaten. Surprisingly, I found some threads on the web of people dying to reproduce the recipe, so I guess I'm not the only one who enjoys Sarku every so often!  Oh, by the way, lots of folks get double meat, but with the soba, I might go into a comatose state if I tried that one, so I just get the regular meat portion. It is PLENTY.  P.S. I've heard you can do double veggie instead of the rice normally served with the teriyaki. I might try that, but it's hard to say "No" to soba noodles. : (

I had been to Riazzi's with co-workers for the affordable lunch specials, so my husband and I decided to give it a try for dinner. We stopped in at just about 5pm on a Sunday. The decor was lovely for the holidays ~ a big fancy tree up front, lights and decorations throughout, and some classic Christmas tunes. Service was very attentive, and we were provided with our drink selections and dinner bread quickly. For dinner, I ordered the tortelloni with a pesto cream sauce for myself and lasagna for my hubby. Each entree came with either a choice of dinner salad or minestrone soup. The salad with Italian dressing was zippy with lots of vinegar, a few beet slices, a pepperoncini, and a few black olives. The tortelloni were giant with lovely ricotta inside and a quality pesto cream sauce. My husband reported that the lasagna was quite good, with a bit of sweetness to the sauce and some nice sausage. We also liked that the server left a small dish of parmesan cheese for us to sprinkle on top of our dishes.  All in all, we were very pleasantly surprised by the high quality food and recipes as well as the great service at Riazzi's. Parking was easy and ample in the private lot, and I appreciate the outdoor courtyard with fountain that you walk through to enter the restaurant.  Recommended for a mellow and tasty night out with a date, a spouse, or friends!

NO CASHIERS AFTER MIDNIGHT?!?  Well, we went to our old Fry's this evening (we used to shop here more often before their brand selection went down the tubes), and much to our disappointment, they have decided that anyone that shops past midnight is not in need of a checkout line!   Hey, I'm pretty darned good with the Self-Checkout, but I really don't want to have to do this for myself at 12:30AM in the morning. Plus, the scanner wasn't very sensitive, so I wound up having to scan some things a couple times.  I recommend that you shop at Safeway at Rural & Broadway instead. They are now open 24/7, it's a much cleaner and nicer store than Fry's (with Starbucks and sushi), AND they actually have cashiers after midnight!  Of course, if you're worried about price, just go to Wal-Mart instead (we recommend the "fancy" one at Country Club & Baseline in Mesa, near the Culver's). Wal-Mart has a somewhat better selection, and they also have cashiers after midnight, even if the lines can get a bit long at times!

I'm a big fan of this place. Hey, it's not much to look at, but the owner is super cool, and the pressing by her staff is very good. Who wants to get their clothes back (and men's suiting) with wrinkles pressed in?? I have gotten that from other supposedly high-end places.   Unless you request it faster, dry cleaning usually is done by tomorrow after 2pm and laundry the day after.  This is not an inexpensive dry cleaning place, but it's probably middle of the road, and they have never messed up my clothes once...

Manuel's Mexican Restaurant on Southern Ave. has always offered good, quick Mexican food. I've visited here for more than 10 years, and the food is always consistently high quality. I particularly like the green corn tamale with rice and beans (AKA, "Mix and Match"). The shredded beef taco is also tasty. My husband always gets the Fiesta Platter, theoretically an appetizer, because it has a bunch of little items to sample.   For the past 10 years or so, the same friendly gentleman has served us the chips and wonderful Manuel's salsa. I think it shows that Manuel's is a quality restaurant for someone to work there for so long! Manuel's isn't fancy, but their food and friendly service keeps my family coming back again and again. Try it!  UPDATE: This location has the best "balloon sculpture guy" I've ever seen! If you have a kid, call ahead to see what nights the guy works. Yes, he really is that good.  (Note that this review ONLY applies to the Southern Ave. location. We have been very disappointed by other locations...)

I'm a die-hard Hoodlums fan. I was there in 1998 when they started up, and I'm happy to say that I still can shop there in 2008!   After the disastrous ASU Memorial Union fire, I saved up all my CD-buying until Hoodlums relocated from the MU to their current location on the southwest corner of Guadalupe and McClintock in Tempe.   I don't know how they do it, but there is musical magic going on at Hoodlums. The staff there truly know their musical stuff ~ if you are in need of musical advice, they will actually make recommendations based on your tastes. The range of the CDs available is joyfully eclectic. I'm always in the mood for a treasure hunt at Hoodlums to see what new and cool music I can find, and they never fail to have in stock some artist that I have never heard of but that is a worthy addition to my collection.  So, in summary, go to Hoodlums, enjoy the in-store music, browse for a while, buy a few CDs (I attempt to limit it to 6 or less on each trip!!), and then stop by the Trader Joe's for some wine to go with your new musical selections!   Repeat as needed.

Open late! This place is always relatively clean when hubby and I visit, and we like that they deliver the food to your table (kind of nice for a fast food joint). We partake of the chicken strips with white gravy and toast from time to time. The burgers aren't bad either ~ pretty large and not frozen-tasting. I also like the fact that they use mustard on their burgers, since I'm a mustard fan. They're also good at honoring my husband's standard order of "only lettuce and tomato." Last but not least, the fries are very boring, but the onion rings are good. Go for the o-rings if you're ordering a burger.  Overall, a good place to catch some late night fast food!

I'm reviewing the catering at Karsten's clubhouse (http://www.asukarsten.com/meetings_special_events/catering/). I have used the catering several times for large groups (100-175 guests). On all occasions, the food and service have always been exactly what we requested and definitely above expectations for such reasonable catering prices.   Eating at the clubhouse in the winter season is especially lovely, since they decorate the entire area with festive lights and a large, beautifully decorated Christmas tree. At a recent December event, we selected a buffet which included vegetarian tamales, string beans with red potatoes, rice pilaf, and glazed carrots. There was also a turkey carving station. I'm very picky, and everything was excellent. The carrots in particular were really yummy with a candy-type glaze on them, but everything was above expectations. The coffee served also was surprisingly good, which is always a treat.   I highly recommend the clubhouse at ASU Karsten Golf Course for your catering needs!

I have yet to find a better fish and chips this side of the Atlantic ocean. Pair it with a Guinness, and you'll be in heaven. Corned beef ain't bad either, although it's not particularly lean (yes, I know, it's an Irish restaurant!).  Good for lunch meals (since it's usually not packed at lunch), as long as you plan on not being able to think very clearly for the rest of the day. ; )  Update #1: I asked an Irish friend of mine for his "take" on Rula Bula's. I didn't want to lead the Yelp community astray... He says it's the best Irish food in town! So, I guess you can take that to the bank.  Update #2: A friend and I were dining at Rula Bula's when a patron behind us starting choking. I gave the heimlich a whirl, but not having the best upper body strength, stepped aside when the professional help arrived (first a very nice cook and then perhaps a manager?). Anyway, heimlich was successful, and everyone went home safe and sound (after eating the rest of the meal, of course). Hey, that's cool. I like eating at a place that's not afraid to save a life or two... Oh, the meal was good too ~ lamb stew for my friend and corned beef for me. ; )

I keep going back to Tokyo Stop, as do all my friends, so I'm giving it an extra star. Plus, it's always packed!   The teriyaki chicken is my new favorite. It's large enough to share with a friend for lunch, as long as you get the lunch combo... : )

For lunch, arrive by 11:30, or expect to wait for a seat. Service is a bit slow (understandably, given how busy they are), but it's fine as long as you aren't in a hurry. The Garlic Chicken and Spicy Noodles dishes are my favorites. Since the chicken pieces are over-large for the dishes, I usually order the tofu. I've visited for lunch several times and have never been disappointed.

Hubby and I have tried a lot of pizza joints in the Valley, and I am originally from NJ ~ mmm, I can still recall the Atlantic City boardwalk pizza from my youth ~ so I think we have a pretty decent base upon which to review a thin crust pizza. Over the years, we've been disappointed with NYPD, Rosati's, Oregano's, and Nello's. Ray's, Lorenzo's, Barro's, and Spinato's were better.  Classic Italian Pizza lives up to the Yelp-hype. CIP specializes in 12" thin crust pizzas. You get a high quality, slightly chewy yet crunchy thin crust pizza with a well-spiced sauce and top shelf Italian toppings (the sausage was delicious!). The brick oven bread appetizer recommended by previous Yelpers comes with a plate of olive oil and marinara that is great for dipping your pizza crusts into...In terms of portion size, my hubby, his friend, and I split two pizzas and a bread appetizer, and that was enough for fairly large appetites. And, finally, the service was awesome, as was the ambiance.   In sum, go now, go often... and probably go on a Thursday night, as it seems you'll be seated immediately!

Yummy, yummy, yummy barbecued pork ribs! I always get the Regular Ribs - 1/3 Slab Platter with a baked potato instead of the sides (which are blah). The corn on the cob and corn bread muffin that come with the Platter are delicious as well. My husband enjoys the Texas Beef Brisket.  So far, I haven't found another BBQ restaurant in the Valley that's better!  UPDATE: I still really like the BBQ here, but we prefer the Mesa Riverview location as it's less busy. Hmm, I'm downgrading from a previous 5-star. That was probably a bit crazy anyway. : )

Is there a limit on the number of good reviews one restaurant can get? Well, let's test that theory! Yes, Cornish Pasty really is good. Yes, this location is REALLY LOUD (but fun)!! Don't bring your date for an intimate meal, especially if s/he's a bit on the hard of hearing side.   Thus far, I have tried both the Chicken Pot Pie pasty and the Cottage Pie pasty (the ground beef version of Shepherd's Pie). The Chicken Pot Pie pasty was just alright, but the Cottage Pie version was pretty darned awesome... Frankly, I was a little afraid of the "ground minted lamb" in the Shepherd's Pie, but maybe I'll try it next time, after drinking a cider to start out with. Did I mention the Strongbow Cider is worth a sip, or two, or three? (I like the fact that they have 3 sizes of Draft Beers, so that I don't have to special request a small glass...)

Having spent 4 years in New Orleans (mostly Creole food) as well as some time in Lafayette (Cajun food, not Creole food!), it's nice to partake of some Cajun fare from time to time, even if it's fast food...   So as long as they don't take away my red beans & rice or my hubby's dirty rice (AKA, Cajun Rice), we'll be happy campers at Popeye's. Hubby misses the naked strips from the recently reduced menu, but my spicy chicken strips are still great, as are the biscuits that accompany the combo meals. I wish there were more diet drink selections, but that goes for almost every fast food chain out there, right now...   Recommended if you are in the mood for a heavy, crunchy, crispy, spicy meal. : )

Hubby's favorite is now the chicken sandwich. I have to admit that the bun is tasty. He pointed out that the lettuce (not iceberg) and tomato (actually red, not pink) are fresh as well.   I still like my spicy strips, red beans and rice, and biscuit. Evil, but yummy!

I'm embarrassed to say that the reason we tried Port of Subs is that the Panda Express next door was full (at 1pm)!   I tried the cheesesteak, and my buddy had a hot pastrami with swiss. They cooked them up well ~ not faux cooking like at Subway. The result was a very decent cheesesteak. I was a bit bummed because they didn't have any tomato sauce or ketchup to go on top. I'm originally from Jersey, and I don't know why, but I like ketchup on my cheesesteaks. It was OK though ~ since the rest was so good.  My buddy liked his pastrami on swiss, commenting that he doesn't like rye bread, so he liked the fact that he could get his pastrami on a plain old white roll.  Oh, also, they had one of those new digital Gold Peak iced tea machines and served Coke Zero. Bonus points for good beverage choices!  So far, so good. I'll try it again sometime and see if my review gets better or worse!

I'm posting this review to overwhelm all the other 1-star stinkers out there. You know who you are! Come on, people. 1-star reviews should be reserved for food that tastes like live bait or has squiggly hairs in it! If you don't like fast food hamburgers, then why the heck are you going to this place to begin with!??? Sheesh.  The quality and service at In-N-Out are always consistent. The ground beef is of average to above average quality, and they will cook your fries extra toasty if you want them to. They always get your order right... What's not to like? I only eat here about once a month, but I'm never unhappy when I do.

There are (at least) two items on the menu that pass the test at Chompie's ~ the corned beef sandwich and the matzo ball soup. They are both worth the visit, although your waistline may not thank you. I get the half corned beef with a side of the soup, and I'm in Jewish heaven. Although several folks have mistaken me for Jewish, I am unfortunately just a boring Gentile. However, my Jersey roots appreciate Chompie's.  HELPFUL HINT: If it's not a traditional Jewish food, don't bother ordering it at Chompie's. Their menu is full of "American" food items that they don't execute very well, not surprisingly. They need to trim down the menu by 2 pages!!

WORST CHEESESTEAK EVER!   Note that you cannot get it without Onions or Green Peppers because, and I quote, "it's mixed in." Um, OK. So, I took a shot. What I got was a cold roll with some sweet tasting, room temperature, pressed meat in it, mashed up with some Onions or Green Peppers, topped with no cheese that was apparent to the naked eye (or could be tasted), and some shredded lettuce and tomatoes. By comparison, the Steak-Um product that you can get in your grocer's freezer section is FINE DINING.   STAY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! We never throw away food, and this went straight into the trash in favor of frozen burritos.... UGH!

For all you folks who need coffee to go with your turpentine, Cartel is the place for you!!   For the rest of us, I hate to pour cold coffee on the Cartel-parade, but I just am not feelin' the love. I ordered an iced cafe mocha. The resulting lukewarm concoction tasted like a very strong brew of chocolate-infused cardboard. *shiver* To tell you the truth, it was vaguely reminiscent of chicory coffee, which is not my "cup of tea," so to speak. I even brought my younger, hipper friend to Cartel to make sure my evaluation was fair, and she now makes a face whenever I mention it!  Try it if you must, since we all like to support our local businesses, but don't blame me if you don't like it...

If you don't like Dairy Queen, just stop reading now...     Are they gone now?   OK, for the rest of us, Culver's is a family-friendly fast food joint, and their Butter Burger is pretty good. As other reviewers have mentioned, the burger is not the same as In-N-Out, but I get sick of the same old burger. I like some variety, and this is a good-tasting, fairly high quality burger. It's a bit unique because they butter the inside of the bun and press the beef patty until you get a slightly toasty outer edge on your patty. As for the sides, the cheese curds are not that great (A&W has better), but the onion rings are good. I haven't tried their crinkle cut fries yet, but I hear they're pretty good. Eh, from now on, I will just get a single Butter Burger and a small custard; that's more than enough food for one person!  I will probably visit Culver's every month or two just to try something new from their large menu. The service is VERY good and VERY friendly, the restaurant is clean, and there is a nice LCD where they show sports games. However, you shouldn't bother coming to Culver's unless you like ice cream. The custard tastes a lot like soft-serve ice cream, but thicker and richer. The different flavors of custard mixes are fun, but avoid the brownie bits (eww!). On the other hand, the turtle mix was really good with all those nice roasted pecans.  Give Culver's a shot. Just skip the sides and save PLENTY of room for dessert

We eat at Cracker Barrel about once a month or so.  So far, the Dobson restaurant beats the Chandler one by a mile. We like to eat out late (open until 10pm Sun.-Thurs., 11pm Fri./Sat.). However, after 8pm or so, the Cracker Barrel on Chandler likes to run out of staples (like chicken and dumplings), but not tell you until they bring half of your meal out. "Oh, did we mention that we're out of the one thing you wanted?"   Personally I love the fried catfish with crunchy cornmeal coating, green beans, mac & cheese, and fried okra. If you're in the mood for breakfast, the pancakes are good as well, and the bacon is thick cut and well done. I recently discovered that the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon meal is really cheap compared to a full meal. While I'm not a fan of the biscuits, lots of sausage gravy makes them edible enough. The cornbread is almost as bad as the biscuits. Apparently some people like both, but I can't see it. Cracker Barrel coffee is not that great either, but I drink it anyway. : )  My husband likes the chicken and dumplings above all else, although he'll eat the fried chicken from time to time (DANGER: it's heavy!).   All in all, if you like Southern cooking, you should give Cracker Barrel a try.

I've eaten at Engrained twice. We like to call it, lovingly, "the frou-frou restaurant at the ASU MU." Any place that has the words Pithivier, Quinoa, Frangipane, Kalamata Tapenade, and Wilcox Flavorina Tomato on their menu, all at the same time, has frou-frou written all over it. Engrained claims to be a "living-learning restaurant committed to locally grown food and environmentally friendly practices." Eh, whatever. So far, it all tastes good, or else I wouldn't bother yelping...  The first time I ate at Engrained, I partook of the prawn spring rolls with a peanut sauce. I have to assume that someone in Arizona is growing prawn in a vat, but that's cool. It was really, really good!    Today I enjoyed, and I quote, "Lamb and Feta Patties with Cucumber Tzatziki Parsnip and Potato Puree" for $10.95. The meal comes with a drink (soda, tea, coffee), so that's really not a bad value for what you are getting. The meal consisted of one good-sized lamb patty with feta cheese mushed into the patty, on top of a yummy mashed potato base with a few string beans and cherry tomatoes. I think there was actually a pesto sauce on the top of the tzatziki, and it sure was delicious!! Portion size always seems adequate, without being overwhelming - a nice change from chain restaurants.  I haven't tried the sushi bar yet... Sushi "grown" in Arizona? Hmmm...  Anyway, do give Engrained a try, and try to guess what part of Arizona your food came from! : )
