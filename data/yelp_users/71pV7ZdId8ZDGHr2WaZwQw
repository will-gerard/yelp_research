Great food, fast and attentive service, good prices. It's not upscale or fancy, but Chens beats the Panda Express option easily.

When it comes to pizza, I am fairly particular. More often than not, when I try a new place, I leave disappointed.   I happened to be driving past Chizona's Pizza and thought I'd stop in for a sandwich. The Italian Beef was outstanding, as were the fries.   The next time I drove by, I decided to take the risk and try the pizza. It was fantastic. Really. The thin crust was perfect, the sauce magnificent, and the toppings generous. It was so good that although I live over 30 minutes away, if I am anywhere near Chizona's, I make it a point to stop in.

Thanks to a nail, I had a slow leak. Stopping by Discount Tire in Tempe, I expected a long wait. Thankfully they got me in and out fairly quickly. The only drawbacks were: it's difficult to find. Some better signage would help on this busy corner. And the sun makes it very bright in the waiting area at that time of day (like 'headache-inducing'), it might be good to use the shades on the west facing window. But I was happy they took care of me so quickly. I don't buy tires anywhere else!

Until I stopped eating out so much, I ate here at least once a week. Now it's once every few weeks. This store has great staff -- manager Chad is the bomb! The recent remodel expanded their seating, and it's easy to see why the other neighborhood pizza spots have closed down or struggled. The pizza and pasta here are great, the wings are very good and the sandwiches (while pricey) are outstanding.   I have several out-of-state visitors each year and we never fail to stop at Venezias for a slice special. If they are lucky enough to hit the spot at the start of their visit, they always get in another meal before heading back home. If they don't go until shortly before their departure, they ask me, "hey! why didn't you take us here sooner!"

Super friendly help, decent flavor to the food, but the sauce on the gyros needs a little work. Still, we were satisfied overall it and enjoyed  our lunch even if it was a tad pricey.

I had a quick lunch here today and I am a FAN.  The meatloaf sandwich was great. The portion was generous and the flavor like 'home-cooking.'   The server was friendly and attentive.  The location and the facility weren't fantastic, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. Next time: breakfast!

My buddy brought me here for a quick lunch. He ordered something for me that I never would have tried: the crazy potato. I was genuinely surprised; in the words of Dora the Explorer: "yum, yum, yum... delicioso!"   The place was clean, the staff pleasant, and atmosphere above average for a quick-stop eatery.   If you are in the neighborhood, don't miss this place!

I don't have much to add -- the other reviewers nail it. The long wait is crazy for a lunch, but that's a well-established fact and there's no reason to gripe about it. Try every meat -- the fatty brisket is incredible, and the smoked turkey is amazing.

Hopefully it was an anomaly but my shaved ice tasted of freezer burn... I've been to several Bahama Bucks in the past, but never had THAT experience before...

A great breakfast and lunch spot. Excellent food -- the breakfast burrito is stellar, as is the french toast. At lunch the bacon cheddar burger is excellent, and if you enjoy wraps you need to try the Turkey Cranberry Wrap - it'll remind you of Thanksgiving at any time of the year.   It hasn't been super busy any of the times I've visited -- yet. That will be sure to change as word spreads about this hidden gem. Nice job by the staff too!
