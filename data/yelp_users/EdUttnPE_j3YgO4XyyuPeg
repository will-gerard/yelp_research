We came on a Sunday  based on good reviews. I had to get my usual grilled pork with vermicelli noodle bowl.  We were seated in an awkward sitting area right by the kitchen. I know I shouldn't expect top notch dining service at a pho restaurant  But where I was seated the busboy cart full or dirty dishes was 2 cm right behind  me.  What was unpleasant was having my seat near the kitchen door with people goin in and out. What was stomach lurching was when I switched seats I had a view of their kitchen which looked grimy. The man at the front counter was wearing sandals when making drinks. A waiter who was taking out the trash I'm not sure if he washed his hands when he was later handling food.   Our noodle bowl itself was small, but decent. We enjoyed the grilled pork as they were marinated properly. But towards the end the noodles became mushy because of temperature and there wasn't enough  lettuce. The pickled veggies were sad strings.  We left full but unsatisfied.  .. The pro are the prices but you get what you pay for. This place needs some work.  Dining experience: 2 Food 3 Overall 2.5

Came here with my friend a Chandler native. Apparently the place changed ownership. The owner at the counter was great helping find a good drink we ended we getting carried away and ordered  fried chicken,dumplings and minced pork rice. there were so many to choose from we had a hard time deciding. They also had many different lunch boxes that I can't wait to try next time I'm in town.  What I loved was how everything was authentic Taiwanese. The owner even gave us extra slices of oranges on the house it felt like having my favorite aunty behind the counter. I got jasmine milk tea with boba the tea wasn't too sweet and boba was chewy. My friends taro milk tea was not bad if you like that purple flavor.  Overall: Service:4 Milk tea: 3.5 for Az 3ish for SoCal standards  Snacks/food: 4

I came in here and looks like they let the graffiti "art" get out of hand. Customers are allowed to plaster their names or write silly things on the wall to their hearts content with sharpies, but its starting to look less like art and more like a mess.  We ordered our regular milk tea with boba. Their milk tea always tastes chalky and for some reason the drink has an odd color... The diamond ice did not look appealing unless you like crushed ice with sad pieces of fruit and hard mochi..  Some of my friends love this place, but it still hasn't warmed up to me yet.

My friends suggested we try this place for sushi. This is one of the worst sushi establishments I've ever been to. First the waitress sat us in the way back And she didn't even hand us a menu!! The only reason I knew was because the ppl beside us started ordering off menu items.  Second the sushi did not look fresh the mayo was turning a different color and not many choices. Also on the conveyor belt were weird items like juice boxes and random stuff that looked like they took stuff out of the fridge...the only pro is that their plates are cheap. But I rather pay for higher quality & a better experience

I come into this Ulta pretty often. Today, I had to review because the staff was doing an excellent job with customer service. A girl from the salon helped me pick out a Round brush to help blow Dry my  color-treated hair. They even we're giving out coupons for their salon services when my hair need a trim I just might come in.  Also, when browsing the make up section there is always a girl to help when you have a question. One sales person helped me with filling in my eyebrows  and recommended now one of my favorite brow product from Anastasia! It's always fun to browse in this store even when I don't need anything because they are always stocked with beauty goodies. I agree with a previous reviewer, the only gripe is the long lines and some products getting sold out.

Another Yogurtland that failed in training their workers. The story is there is a new yogurtland app. After seeing the sign I Downloaded it to get pt's on my phone. When I came back to get my point... The girl at the cashier changed from when we first came in.  In the beginning it was all smiles & hellos....Colorful yogurtland rainbows ***then later when we had an issue... all the attitude came out. When i asked her for a receipt. She lied and said that we didn't ask for it.   When it turned out my hubsss had it in his pocket!! niceeee....  Then they brought their Assistant manager later who also lied to us. Saying we can get our return later online. "OHhhhhh hrmmm did they train me? I think you can click that link" Yeah, that's for filling out a survey totally unrelated.  The whole staff here gets a bravoooo for all that acting.   It really ruined the whole experience. With such noobs,  I'm not sure if i ever want to step foot in a Yogurtland again.

Being new to the area my hubs and I were looking for a good family dentist that we could trust and wouldn't try to upsell us all the time and do a good job. Another dentist kept pushing a $200 whitening treatment when he really didn't need them.  We decided to go with our friend's recommendation.  When we came in for our appt. We were greeted by the staff. It was early morning and I just wanted to sit down. We got to sit in their nice waiting area. The decor was nice and they were playing relaxing music. There were also some of my favorite mags I could browse while we waited.   When we were called to our rooms the hygienist helped us. When I finally got to meet Dr. Shim he was very helpful in explaining preventative health and all the different options if I was interested. I was experiencing Jaw pain from TMJ and sometimes my jaw would POP. They also told me about flossing more regularly and when the best time is to brush your teeth. Which is after breakfast!! Gross, but who would've thought?   Had to get two teeth refilled from last year...because my previous dentist didn't do a good job...but i was numbed up by the Dr. and didn't even feel a thing. I never had such a fast filling done. And biting into food doesn't feel off.   Well I'm glad they took the time to explain everything so that I could take the right steps in correctly and hopefully needing less work next year. The staff is all very nice here you'll have a great experience.

New to the area, I was in desperate need for a hair cut and style. My hair had split ends and was very flat from the dry weather in AZ.   Upon arriving to the store. I was greeted by the wife of the owner. She was very friendly and helped me with my things and prepared my salon coat. We had a nice chat  as she  washed my hair. Found out the couple was from LA i knew i was in good hands.  I brought a picture to show what i wanted. There were times i didn't and ended up looking like a korean boy. I wasn't trying to recreate coffee prince, or worseeee MILEY CYRUS.   After my shampoo and cut which felt like   just minutes I got to see my hair. Jim did magic as he was snipping my nice layers, and giving me a chic A-line bob.  I feel like a kpopstarrr!  My next mission will be to grow my hair to try their Japanese digi perm.  Kamsamnida Jim Jeon Salon!!

A 50 cent charge to use credit card. The sign for the drive thru should be 10 times bigger. I was refunded the amount because I used cash for my drink.  I got a large taro smoothie  without boba which came out to 4.97 under the $5 charge policy. The drink was really good however the customer service was lacking...

So today, I decided to give this place another shot. I previously received really bad layers from the salon across the street. And a girl I met recently received an amazing ombre from Holly. Today I got a consultation from Holly who recommended me to wait two more months so the unevenness in my hair will grow out.    I'm glad she didn't rush me into getting my hair done for a quick buck like other places. Cause I prolly would be unhappy.  Can't Wait For My Hair To Grow Out For balyage! Ladies go to Holly she knows her stuff

I've been waiting two years for my hair to grow out into a perfect LOB (long bob). After getting burned by so many different stylists in the area, I finally waited for Hollys hair coloring advice. It took 5 months to get my hair to the right length because I had uneven layers looking like a asian mullet situation. After my hair appointment last week Holly worked her magic and my hair looks longer and I walked out feelin' like a million bucks!   The color was brought up higher and my hair looks sun-kissed. She used Joico hair color, toner, and matrix shampoos so it definitely  made a difference. She also took care of myself & another patron we had snacks and complimentary water, plus girlchat. I LOVE my new medium length balyage thanks holly! She's the best in terms of hair coloring & I wont go anywhere else!

Walking around during the New Year.  I noticed my friend's impeccable  eyebrows.  She said she got them threaded at a shop in Texas.  That's when i decided for my New Years resolution I NEEDED better brows.   When approaching  the Shapes brows bar there were already girls laying down on chairs in the middle of the malls to get their faces plucked by the eyebrows artists.  However,  there are two  sets of chairs to wait on so it was hard to tell who was in line. When I asked "where is the line??? " noone responded... After 15 min of waiting in an odd area we took our business  elsewhere.     The ladies working here need some serious work in customer service: #1 we werent greeted by anyone.   #2 we weren't reaasured about the wait #3 huge confusion on who was in line (3  ladies cut in front of us)  #4 brow dreams ruined.

Finally got my eyebrow situation in check.  I came here by a friend's recommendation. When coming in to the store its eally hard to find make sure to look for a little eye symbol by Victoria's Secret.   My associate got me seated in the chair right away. She was very friendly however it was very awkward having other customers waiting in line for their turn to watch me as my eyebrows group plucked.   They really need some music or something in there to keep it more relaxed and lively. Awesome $2 discount with checkin! I'll be back guys kept up the good work.

This place was right under my nose and I have never noticed it!! When I came here on a hot Saturday I was in the mood  for something sweet. looking on the menu we wanted to try their taro smoothie. The lady at the counter was nice and our drink was made quickly.   They had a display of donuts to choose from and breakfast sandwiches. Our large taro smoothie hit the spot and was filling. Their store is open 24/7 next time I'm in a rush ill have to try their croissant sandwich. Thanks Arizona Donut co!

Came on Taco Tuesday!  I got two shrimp tacos and fries and opted for a free drink upgrade vs an extra taco.  The batter on the shrimp was nice and crispy. They have a salad and salsa bar that you can freely top your taco with chipotle sauce and avocado sauce, peppers, and salsa. The fries were also delicious. At first sight the tacos looks small but with the seasoned fries and the extra toppings from the salad bar we left stuffed and happy! If your really felling adventurous try watermelon tea with sprite while your at it my personal fave

We came to merci cafe for the ambiance but we were blown away by the service and the food!!   Highlights:  i got the kobe burger with brioche bun and frites. The brioche bun was soo good with a flaky crust it tasted like a french biscuit almost. Truffles frites were also tasty and finished with in seconds  French onion soup salty  For dessert we had the chefs special with pistachio mousse layered with strawberry mousse.  It wasn't too sweet and was super smooth.  You must try this!  Can't wait to come back for their weekend menu. The chef & wife team were very nice. The chef came to talk to us when we had dessert & said he only uses Belgium chocolate for his desserts. We were very happy & bellies full. Merci!!

Found this place through fellow yelpers. After staying in the sun all day we were hungry and wanted all you can eat.  When we walked in there were ppl waiting. It took a couple of min to get the waitress to greet us. The family before us left because there were no tables. Lots of ppl In the dining room came in parties of 6 or more which left no space for smaller parties.    Luckily a table opened up for us. We ordered a bunch of specialty rolls. Including  XS roll,  Sweet heart roll, Las Vegas Roll, Amazing tuna, Manhattan roll, Angry dragon roll. Volcano roll   A lot of variations had imitation crab meat, mango, cream cheese, avocado or tempura  The Standouts has to be XS roll & Sweet heart roll   Las Vegas roll was a fried sushi with cream cheese and Volcano roll was similar with more sriracha decorations we wished we had gotten instead sashimi which was very fresh and was served with thick slices  Best sashimi: salmon, tuna           Nigiri: eel, salmon roe   Cons: There is a long wait for the sashimi and servers sometimes get orders mixed up, understaffed   Pros: fresh sashimi, price, generous portions. Ice cream

We came on grand opening day. The place was nice clean and bright. Looks like its a family owned business. They have a cute logo, an artic fox.   We were waiting in a long line eagerly awaiting our Bogo treats. I got milk tea with regular boba, a small taro with red bean mochi and hubs got the mango snow with flan pudding and mochi.   The snow itself was a little chewy when it is usually supposed to be soft shave ice like a creamy snow. I liked the flavors however they were on point. And the staff was really friendly. Hope they do well out here in AZ. Much needed option.   I think the larger portions or their snow specials maybe a better choice, which we will try next time.    Overall: Location: 3                Flavor 3.5                Service: 4

Extremely slow service even though there is no one here... I waited 5 minutes to order my drink then an additional 10 minutes just to wait for one drink which is very easy. In terms of efficiency they have have a long way to go.   Despite the gripe for the wait I keep coming back for the green milk tea with redbean and oolong milk tea. Sometimes the drinks come out watery and sometimes they come out perfect.   My friend got a regular milk tea but the flavor was just not there. Disappointed...However, when the Big Boss is there from SD my drinks come out nice. I like the regular milktea with redbean and boba. I wish they didn't charge .60 more the drink.   Oh and please get the regular stamp card or fivestars or something...*With the perka app you have to go through an additional steps of scanning your barcode on your receipt. Ain't noone got time for that.   Efficiency: 2 Customer service/ Friendliness: 2.5 Drinks:3 hit or miss

With the heat wave this weekend we needed a good boba break. We decided to give Teastreet another try.   In stead of milktea we tried the  Top 10 menu selction Yogiberry. The cashier was helpful  in helping us.   We subbed strawberries for  lychee popping boba. She was very  quick and efficient with our ice blended surprise.  Within 2 minutes before I had time to even scan my perka app our drink had arrived!  We went back in line and ordered a lychee milk tea. So far oolong milk tea, red bean milk tea and yogiberry are my faves!

Happy to find a korean chicken place in AZ. This is in the space that Chino Bandino used to be loved that they kept the Panda Bandit. The Place: When walking in its a huge venue. One could rent out the place if they wanted for a dinner party or family gathering or company luncheon. They have two flat screen TVs and a stage. Well, when we walked in there was only 1 other korean family it was pretty quiet. They really need music playing for more energy in the restaurant. The owner came out to greet us and was very nice.   The Food: We ordered the shrimp  Fried rice & Half Sweet &spicy chicken. The sweet & spicy chicken is garlicy, sweet and sticky. The portion was pretty big and we were stuffed. The hubs usually just orders mild but the wings weren't spicy.   Shrimp Fried rice was smaller than I expected. It had a lot of butter and soy sauce. I would say skip rice for more chicken!   ***They are doing a super bowl Sunday special!  .50 cents per wing and they also do delivery within 5 miles of the area We are definitely coming back for a chicken fix. Support local business!

We came here for a sunday afternoon treat. It was quite spacious inside.  This is in the same plaza as tempe cinemas youll know when your in the right place because there is a giant ice cream statue outside.. We tried all the indian flavors but they were too strong for us we eventually went with butter pecan and fig which had a light butter flavor.  We got a double scoop which was plenty for the both of us. The size was for refernce like a Coldstone Love it size. They also had really beautifully decorated cupcakes. I got the the coffee butter cream cupcake and it looked almost too pretty to eat.. This is a cute place to have girl chat and desserts will be back to try more cupcakes.

Very happy with the service tonight. The much anticipated  Koreatown has been open for a month! How did I not know this? After visiting Sonoran lights we were in the mood for Korean Tofu Soup. To our delight Koreatown was open .   We ordered Kimchi Pancake and two orders of Korean tofu soup I ordered Mixed. The  Seafood tofu soup had small bits of shrimp and 1 or two mussels and clams. The hubs was hoping for more seafood but the flavor was nice.  My tofu soup was "mixed" but had the smallest sliver of beef.  I would suggest going for seafood because mixed is a dollar  extra.    Kimchi pancake came out on a large round metal pizza size plate. The kimchi pancake was good but I would prefer crispier. The sauce we didn't care for,  was VERY salty. Actually dipping the pancake in the tofu soup tasted better.   Our waitress tonight was really great. We didn't get her name but kudos to her cause she was carrying all the trays and checking up tables. Also , the space was very clean and spacious and their AC was blasting which is nice for AZ.   PS. ***Koreatown is better than Hodori. Happy there is a korean restaurant with NICE korean people and food!

Was extremely excited about Bambu coming to AZ from my hometown San Jose! I was anticipating the opening ever since seeing the Bambu car at Chandler Fashion Mall  Bambu has fruit smoothies, vietnamese coffee, boba and the vietnamese dessert che. I Loovve the coconut milk and three beans and jellies! It's like colorful, squishy gummies with different textures on top of crushed iced and creamy coconut milk. Yummmm..     We ordered the #6 fruit addict it was hard to decide what to get. I liked that it came with pieces of real coconut and jackfruit, lychee and red tapioca.  I wish it had more beans and coconut milk there was so much jellies that there was very little coconut milk.   Price wise felt a little higher than usual $5 but because  the place was clean and they accept credit card!( They don't charge  minimums like most asians places) I think l'll let it slide.   Next time I will customize my che you can choose inredients as you please. *Don't need to order the preset combos. Hurray hope bambu is here to stay!  PS. please bring loyalty cards ! ;)
