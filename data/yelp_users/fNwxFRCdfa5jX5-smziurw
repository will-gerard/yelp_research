I live across the street and can't eat here any more.  I went in once for lunch to go and the one of the curries melted through it's container and one to my car seat.  The other ones were lacking in salt and spice- very much boxed versions....no love in the food.  I too experienced the crunchy rice.  What turned me off completely was that my bf and i went in once to pick up some sweets and there was a nice american lady ahead of us in line that had ordered the same thing that we were going to, and the owner quoted us a different price that what he quoted her!!! Epic fail.

Being south indian myself, i really really want to see south indian restaurants  succeed in the valley, and being a life long vegetarian I really want to see such restaurants continue.  This was my first time at Udupi, and can honestly say I went in with high expectations, and left wanting never to go back.   We got there at 2:40 and I asked the host, if it was too late to enjoy the buffet and if we should order from the menu or take the buffet- he insisted the buffet would be wonderful.  I mentioned that this was our first time here and asked if there was anything special we should try.  he said the buffet is wonderful and that while they close the buffet at 3, we should feel free to enjoy our lunch after.  Everything looked appetizing so we loaded our plates and sat down. The waiter brought out two dosa's for us and everything had the makings of a good lunch. BIG problem 1: Sadly, the food was cold, even the dosa they supposedly freshly made was cold- not just the crepe on the outside, which would naturally cool quickly, but the filling inside as well.  I mentioned the cold food to the waiter and he actually GRINNED and walked away.  Maybe he didn't hear me?  who knows.  Big Problem 2: Our host didn't tell us that it wasn't just the buffet that closed at 3, but the restaurant itself. Our waiter actually changed his clothes and left without even telling us!! I looked around for him, and the host came over and asked us "what are you searching for?" and i mentioned our waiter and he goes "oh he went home, we are closed right now, we are all just waiting for you so we can also go" so of course, we dropped our forks mid-bite got up and left- $13 per person!! when i mentioned the cold food, the host said that the food is cold because they turned off their food warmers over half an hour ago (um, thanks for the heads up)  You know, i could forgive the gaps in service if the food was stellar.  but it was eh, with the exception of the spinach kootu dish with was delicious.   I went up to the condiment bar and when i moved a ladle a bunch of fruit flies came out of the salad area- yuck.   WHY would anyone with any amount of self-respect serve a guest food they new was cold/sub par and then hurry them out of there.  If he had just said- hey we close completely in 20 mins, please join us for dinner I absolutely would have come back.  Greedy Greedy Greedy.   I sincerely hope my experience is an isolated incident, but I'll never go back, not will i ever suggest them to anyone.

fabulous food, great price. The ladies who make the food and bring it out are sweet and wonderful people who make me feel like i'm at their house instead of at a restaurant.  If i could change anything it would be the guys at the front- the older gentleman chews tobacco while he's talking to you and sometimes spits, and the younger one- I guess his son- has a serious lack of people skills but i'll put up with both for the goodies that come out of that kitchen- try the vada paav or the gol guppa chaat....yum.

I'll keep this sweet and to the point, realistically, i'd give this place a 3.5  Pros: *willing to accommodate food allergens- I've vegan, and super lactose intolerant. *beautifully decorated restaurant, well plated food. *the food is made to order, even the sauces. *I liked some of the inventive touches in their food- my curry with peas, pumpkin, baby corn. *one of our companions asked for extra sauce and they very kindly made more  Cons: *Portions are ridiculously small for the price.  Everyone at our table of 9 ordered a separate entree, and no own was full, even the ones who got appetizers. *My throat was killing me, so I asked for some warm water, instead of iced, while I looked over the menu- they brought back water that was colder than room temp, without the ice and I was politely informed that this is what they had.  But I wonder how in the world they serve hot tea on the menu, if they don't have hot water in the kitchen.   *Some of the veggies in my curry were undercooked (think aldente potato)  All in all the flavor of the food was good, but 1 cup of rice and 1.5 cups of curry does not a 18 dollar entree make. You really are paying for the ambience and customer service.  If i had a special occasion, i'd prolly visit here again, but when i'm needing a thai-fix, there are other places around town that have equally great food, without the upcharge.

not impressed. I'll be brief-  went in to get a few cupcakes for a very sweet-tooth prego friend of mine.  I was the only customer there and was speaking to her on the phone describing the cupcakes- the guys who were there seemed impatient, which I can understand if there was a line out the door but they had 3 hours left till close and not one other customer in the store. I found out that one of the guys there was the owner and had been there since early in the morn- i get it you're tired, but if you want my repeat business, it'd be great if you smiled when I was purchasing something.  The cupcakes:  we tried two cupcakes- redvelvet & caramel apple.  The red velvet was pretty terrible, I got it because my bestie loves red velvet but it just tasted like food coloring to me and she agreed. the frosting was pretty good, and my niece licked all of that off.   the caramel apple cake was my fav- it was moist and delish, but the frosting was way too sweet and too much for both our tastes- again my niece loved the frosting and licked it off.   So there were aspects we enjoyed, but on the whole both cakes were a mess.  I haven't entirely written them off, but seriously doubt I'll be back anytime soon.  and yes, this was me being brief.
