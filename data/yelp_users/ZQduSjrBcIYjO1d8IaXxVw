THE best place in Phoenix to see a live band. I have been here a few times for the Red Elvises, who have played here a few times a year since 1998. Also saw a few other shows here, the staff are friendly and helpful and the drinks are reasonably priced. Oddly, last time I was here n a Tuesday night, they were actually busier than they were on a Saturday.

I usually come here once or twice a week. I love their gyros and fries - both very authentic and served Chicago-style. The staff are very friendly and accommodating, and they serve some good desserts as well. Good selection of Middle Eastern sodas, snacks, and other ingredients as well. I'm a fan!

I drove by this location earlier today and was a little sad that they were closed for good... then I realized, who needs Borders when you have a perfectly good Half Price Books across the street? And a B&N nearby?

Pretty decent food here, reminded me of Chipotle a little. Too many onions and green peppers in the burrito I ordered, but I liked the freshness of everything, as well as the outdoor seating. They need more umbrellas or shade, as there was not enough seating outside for other customers that also didn't want to eat in direct sunlight.

Meh. It's Olive Garden, I guess the breadsticks were OK, warm and garlicky. And the service was decent. But the salad was all iceberg lettuce. And the chicken and shrimp carbonara? I didn't really notice much chicken in there at all, and the shrimp were pretty small. I don't know that I would come here on a regular basis.

Very good and attentive service here. The dolsot bibimbap and chapchae are tasty, authentic and worth a return visit. Nice complimentary miso soup as well. All in all, as good as it gets.

The location and atmosphere were promising, as was the open kitchen and friendly staff. Initially it felt like we were dining in Thailand (or it was like watching an episode of No Reservations). I actually found most of the food to be bland and flavorless, apart from the Pad Thai, which was just too darn sweet. The mussaman curry with beef could have used some spice, or even just some salt. The fried spring roll appetizer was perfect, but it took quite a while for the staff to take our entree order. I will be back, because I like the place and want to see them succeed, but when I ask for 4 out of 5 on the spiciness scale, please make the food have at least some kick to it? OK?

Large portions all around... my sister had the lox, my nephew had the corned beef and I had an omelet... great food and great prices. I would say it's an authentically Kosher place except for ham on the menu as well as the number of dishes mixing meat and dairy. Excellent bagels, however. As General MacArthur said, I shall return.

This was my first time at this location, but I was impressed, The staff were friendly and helpful, and even moved tables around to accomodate our large group. They were also very good at keeping waters refilled, chip baskets topped off, and food arriving hot and fresh. Even the numerous unusual requests and separate checks barely phased them. They must come from the planet of Krypton or something.

Wow. Major overload of food here. Even the regular fries is an amazingly huge size. Granted, they are fries that have seen potatoes very recently, which equals fresh. Too much salt though. And, as a guy, no way I can go in and order one of the "little" burgers; that's what the ladies at my table ordered. So, it's gotta be the double cheese, with bacon (of course), with everything. Only problem was, I couldn't seem to figure out their newfangled soda machine. I tried to get a cherry vanilla Coke, but it came out tasting like regular Coke. Oh well, maybe next time.

Tasty gyros, and lots of it! They serve Kronos from Chicago, shaved right off the spit so you know it's authentic. And they really pile on the meat, too! The tsaziki sauce was freshly made, too. I could see myself coming here more often, if only I lived closer...
