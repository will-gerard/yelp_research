Came here to order some gumbo to go which I've done before and the bald man working says if u r ordering to go u have to wait in line with all the people who are eating here which makes no sensr brcause we are not eating here.  This will probably be my last time coming here or bring anyone which I've done many times in the past. Talk to a couple people and they said the same thing and how the bald guy was being rude.  To be honest the best gumbo next to the south is Ritters in the oc, couldn't believe how bad the service was here.  Do not waste your time or money coming here horrible service and food is only good depending on who takes care of it.

After a long day of hiking we stopped into this spot for dinner, everything was great quality and the service was outstanding. We had the spinach salad, calabrian pizza and pesto noodles =) sooooo good! We were visiting from out of town to do some hiking/camping and they even comped our dessert. Definetly give this place a try next time you're in phoenix or a local for sure!
