Wonderful country store. Christmas time was nice with unique ornaments and decorations. I purchased a table here not too long ago, good quality and i constantly receive compliments on the piece.

I found this place on Yelp looking for a metaphysical book store. They have a wonderful selection of books and cards. Prices are pretty standard depending on what you are buying. I also had a reading done the second time I went in. I cant seem to recall her name but she did a very good job. I was having some serious anxiety about having my first reading done and then also more anxiety about the things going on in my life. She took my hand and reassured me that no matter what the cards say its ok, she really made me feel at ease. I will be returning for many things from tarot to readings and crystals.

I was so disappointed with the Salt Cellar. We made reservations here for our anniversary dinner knowing what a phx staple this place is. table was ready which woudlnt have been a problem considering that the place was empty. My hubby had the scallops and lobster which were average at best. I had the steak ordered rare it came more medium and wasnt that tasty. For the price i just wasnt impressed. there is a ton of great food in the area and i wont be returning. it wasnt all bad the wait staff was very friendly and the oysters were ok. just the quality isnt there for the price.

Everything I've had has been amazing! Especially fond of the Cinnamon Roll French Toast. It's literally a cinnamon roll sliced and fried like French toast. Omg. Steak and eggs was real good too. Can be a greasy spoon depending on what you get

We were greeted by a warm smiling pig. After navigating through the novelty pig signs and Route 66 decor and having a ton of saw dust in my flip flops we were seated at a picnic like table. Waitress came and took our drink orders and answered my questions about the menu. Ended up with the baby back ribs with mac and cheese and "horsey spuds" mashed potatoes whipped with Horseradish. Food came very quickly and let me tell you about these ribs. My god. I'm not a huge rib aficionado but i know good ribs when the bones literally fall out of the meat. BBQ sauce is served on the side in a cast iron skillet. It was perfect. Good portions of food and good prices. The horsey spuds had the perfect bite and the mac and cheese was homemade. brought some ribs home for later and more sauce. Sides are never ending.   This Main St drag is home to many retirement communities and snow birds this time of the year, so once you've mowed over the walker and parked next to the electric scooter the food is amazing. Steer clear of the gift shop next door. Lots of gas station-esq novelty items that have been marked up ten times to appease the Canadian crowd. If you can get past the surrounding neighborhood the food is so so worth it.   BF had pulled pork sand which and it was perfect too. I like that the drinks come in mason jars too. Checked in via Yelp and received a free drink

I was so disappointed in this place. Really sad about my experience here. I find that in Gilbert its pretty hard to find a locally owned place. Lots of chains around here. So I was pretty excited to see how JP was. There wasnt a sole in sight was we came in around 10am and the waiter looked like he didnt know where he was, very quiet. We sat and took a look at the menu, mostly typical breakfast stuff. Pancakes and eggs. I ordered the Banana Chocolate Chip Pancakes and my breakfast partner ordered the French Toast Combo. Food was fast about 10 min. Pancakes were average at best. Def tasted like a mix instead of homemade. However, my buddies food was terrible. He insisted that the french toast was frozen and bacon and eggs were not even edible! Thats pretty bad if he couldnt get through the bacon. We sadly will not be returning. I hate to write a not so good review about a local spot. Get it together JP. Prices were a little high as well.

Thai Chili is a hidden gem in Gilbert. I have been to Thailand a few times and love the food honestly this is the most authentic I have found in the US and haven't had a bad meal here.  Some of my favorites are the crispy chicken with plum sauce and the sticky rice. Lets talk about the handmade coconut ice cream. Holy moley it is amazing. You cant not have a scoop made in house. When mango is in season the stickey rice with ice cream and mango, cant go wrong. Just try this place. You will just as in love as the rest f us.

I really like this place. Tried it out on a groupon and they did an awesome job. Ive been coming for pedi and mani and it has always been reasonably priced and they give out coupons. Also salon is always clean and sanitary. today i had them do a design in my nails and it came out adorable. A good value and a good experience.

I cant say enough good things about the academy. I have been going to the toni and guy at san tan for awhile and trust them always, however they are expensive. the academy gives the exact quality and standard of work from the salon for a third of the price. check in offers and free services from mentioning yelp. I have Bella do my hair she is amazing!

Awesome place. Reminds me a lot of restaurants in Asia and Europe. Casual, good food, loft. Very cute food was good, I like the steak sandwich, and I believe this will become the new "spot" no pun intended to hang out at in Gilbert they are pretty crowded on weekends

I love my tanning salon. I have been coming to iBeach gilbert for over a year now and have not been disappointed, They are a little pricey but the 24hr convenience is well worth paying a little more. Staff has always been friendly. Members save on lotions and email list receives coupons and i only get maybe one email a month rather than everyday i like that

Love these guys. Bought my Mac book here about a year ago, got a great price and a great product. I recommend all my friends and family here for all apple needs. Just went in today too needing a new power cord. The guy working tested it and gave me an honest answer about where to get a new one. Keep it up Orchard great customer service and product. Love supporting local business too!

I live and have lived about a mile from this place and finally stopped in a few days ago. I really like it here. They have a large selection of all kinds of used books. They arent as big as some of the other used books in the valley but i walked out with more than a few books for under $20. If your in the area I highly recommend checking it out. Just take a look

Similar problems as other reviewers, had a groupon for mani/pedi with hot stone and paraffin wax. I really hate when businesses treat you differently because you have a groupon. Me and my mother went in and both were bossed around about being late and not picking out colors quickly enough. When I sat down my water was so hot I couldn't put my feet in right away ( I like hot water, but it's winter I can't just plunge in) my tech comes over and pushes both my feet in! Guess I'm in. She starts on the pedicure and cut me a few times removing my cuticles. While she's doing that a gentleman comes over and slips the paraffin wax on my hands. The paraffin wax and hand massage felt good. My tech asks if I need callus remover, which at every other salon is $5, they charge $7 and didn't even do the entire bottom of my foot. When it comes time for my foot paraffin wax they slip the bag on my foot and I screamed because it was so hot. I tell her I'm in pain and she starts massaging the liquid around my foot so now my entire foot is burned! I should have called it quits then but my mom next to me wasn't complaining and I wanted her to enjoy. The hot towels were scorching and the stone massage lasted maybe 5 min. My manicure was also very clumpy and cloudy and started peeling off the next morning. Looked like all their polish was really old. I won't be returning. My plea to owners if you don't like people using groupon stop using groupon.

If I could give negative stars I would. I started to write my whole story here, but no one really cares. I got a really bad dye job here and the girl Yvette that did my hair was so mean and rude. No nice way to put it. At one point in the appointment she called me a racist. When I left the salon I had a yellow racing strip up the back of my black hair and my roots were dyed orange. How embarrassing for the stylist that did it. Take warning, your at the Fiesta Mall that should be the first clue... If your as cheap as me and want some quality, go up to Toni and Guy...
