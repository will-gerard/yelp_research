The food is pretty tasty, no complaints there.  The atmosphere is quiet and a little awkward at dinner time. Also, I asked for a side of chutney and they charged $3 for a little cup.  It really feels like you are being nickled and dimed. It isn't really a good value either.  I would recommend taking the food to-go or maybe going at lunch.

My very favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix. The staff is amazing, a family run joint.  Get the Panang curry, drunken noodle, and a wonton soup.  Oh! and the eggplant is amazing!  Just get one of everything....

This is the very best place to get Singapore Rice noodles!  All the dishes are amazing but the Chinese here is the best. It isn't bland and greasy like most places. Totts is clean and the staff is super sweet. Would recommend!

I'm here once a week.  The staff is great.  The food is better!  Spicy Tuna Cracker app is a winner. Baked scallop roll is a must have.  They have so many different rolls, there is something for everyone. Rice free, low-carb options available as well. ooh!  Get the jalapeno popper app. It's stuffed with crab. Soooo good.

My boyfriend and I love to go out to eat in midtown.  Great vibe in a very cool building. All the food was amazing.  He had a custom pizza and i had the beet salad.  We split a cheese board and had a couple cocktails. The service was excellent.  We will be going back again soon.

Amazing food! Open burrito was amazing! Fish tacos are great. Great vibe too! Service was slow, but it think its because they became so popular so fast! They were very nice about it though. Really interesting decorations!
