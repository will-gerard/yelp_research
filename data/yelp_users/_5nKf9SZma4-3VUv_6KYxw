If I were rating on the food alone I would give it a 4 star. I enjoy the food served here. Unfortunately the service is subpar. The cashier was very rude. My wife asked if they had tea and the cashiers response was "Ya we do, I have no idea what kind though, it's over there you can go check it out" after ordering the tea the cashier handed my wife a steaming glass of water. We waited for our sandwiches, finished eating and it is STILL steaming, way too hot to even sip still.

Food is great. Although the location is a little bit off the beaten path it makes for a nice, quiet dinner. The sushi is authentic and they have Chinese food for those not fond of sushi. The cheetah roll is by far my favorite.. Even though it is a little gimmicky with the flaming hot Cheetos in the center, it tastes amazing!
