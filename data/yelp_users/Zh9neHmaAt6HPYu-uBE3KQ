Great, friendly service, nice location, and terrific food! Not your typical "coffee shop", think Starbucks meets Paradise Bakery. This will be a new favorite Tempe lunch spot. I was here for a business meeting and they were extremely curteous and helpful without being intrusive. I'm a huge fan!

The Pavilions is definitely on the road to revival. The Food Court has been completely revamped (although many stores are still vacant), YC's is always delicious and I can see the developers vision for the future. I sold a foreclosure home nearby to an investor several years back and he went on and on about how this redevelopment was coming, but only in the last 6 months has it been so apparent. Salt River Fields next door has been very successful, and reopening the movie theater was also a huge plus. Pavilions will soon be a nightly Scottsdale destination again, and not just on Saturday nights!

We've been driving past this place for years, finally tried it tonight. Food was great, service was excellent, and the restaurant was very clean and inviting. Will definitely be back!

We come here pretty much weekly. It's a bit of a drive (we have a Good Egg about 10 minutes closer) but well worth it. The service is prompt and friendly, and you are always warmly greeted at the door. Protein pancakes are our favorite, try substituting apples for the blueberries for a new experience.

Well, we tried this place for the second time, with similar results. I want this place to be better (we live down the street), as it has a "Zipps" type look to it, but doesn't come close to stacking up. The food is very bland and flavorless, the staff seems unfriendly and too busy to be bothered. The server asked if I wanted a small or large beer, I specifically said small and she brought a large. Instead of just leaving it, she took it back to "make" it a small...why wouldn't you just leave it at that point, instead of bringing back a flat, warm beer??? Customer service is not their forte here, I'd recommend Humble Pie or Mellow Mushroom.
