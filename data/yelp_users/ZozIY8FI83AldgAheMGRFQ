I actually want to get this place zero stars but that is not an option. I went here with my family my aunt and uncle words are from out-of-town and I had suggested this place because I have had the food there before and it was very good. We got to the restaurant at a decent time on a Monday night there was three other tables, we asked to down in one of the empty booths but she told us that we could not. That we had to wait. . We looked around and couldn't figure out why it was a 25 minute wait. We said okay we would like to sit down the bar and have a drink my uncle and aunt enjoy a nice glass of wine. The waitress who was very rude, told us that if we sat down at the bar to have a glass of wine that we cannot sit at a table. We looked to her completely confused she said that we could not dirty two areas of the restaurant. I couldn't believe what I was hearing! We said okay and could we sit at a table, that we will stay at for dinner,  we will understand if they couldn't get to us for the 25 minutes we can still sit and have a drink, she said no we have to stand there or sit on the bench waiting for a table for the 25 minutes or we cannot eat there!!!!  We left the restaurant and I will never return. I have now read the reviews how the service has sank. It's sad because it was a very enjoyable place at one time. Big fat F for this place.

I just left the paint store and I'm literally still sitting in the parking lot because I'm so P-o'd . I went in there with a chip of paint and told them I needed a paint match. The guy said they could do it and I expressed to them that it had a hint of purple in the paint at my home I just picked up the paint and it is not even close to being the same color he would not help me out. Basically told me I was S out of luck. I will never go back there again the guy was a complete arrogant you know what. Now I have a paint color that doesn't match anything in my home and I cannot use it. Reading through the reviews I see that the same problem has occurred to other people. I would go anywhere but here from now on and I used to go there quite a bit. I wish there was an option to get zero stars but the guy that help me this morning was nice.

If I didn't like how close this place was to my house or the giant selection of fabrics I would give it zero stars! The customer service is horrendous!  the people that work there are the rudest people I've ever seen in my entire life at a store. That's all

Two stars for having my product. Rude lady wouldn't go back in ever. She's very condescending sounding. Tanks are WAY overpriced.

Bad bad customer service.  I bought a bag that ended up cracking all the way around the top. I took it back and they specifically told me it was a defective batch and they replace it which was very nice of them. Well the person that they replaced it with is also part of the defective batch because it's done it again and they refused to replace it. I will never ever buy another Louis Vuitton purse from anywhere seeing how I spent $2000 on this purse and don't even want to use it because of how bad the cracks are I'm including pictures to show you I would advise going with another brand because the customer service and rudeness of the sales staff is horrendous! ZERO STARS

I have to say this is one of my favorite places in all of Arizona. I have many dogs and many cats and I am truly treated like family at this establishment. Everyone here is just amazing! The owners are two of the greatest guys they have even helped my son out, who also works there! In time of need. With rides when his bike broke down etc. The quality of food they have for their dogs and cats is outstanding. I literally am in there twice a week getting treats and different stuff for my dogs. My dogs are groomed there by some of the best groomers in the valley. Holly is awesome Kevin is awesome Val is awesome they are just downright awesome people. No I was not paid to write this! Haha. This is how I truly feel. Danika is an amazing person! Truly. I am greeted with a hug and a smile and she knows exactly what my dogs one it's just fabulous! Emily who is the manager is a sweetheart Britney is wonderful, Beau is a cool dude too super super nice!!!   Richie one of the owners, gave my son a chance when he was 16 years old to work there. He is now 18 1/2 years old and still there! He could not imagine working anywhere else he truly loves it. Obviously when he's older he will move on to other things but right now his heart belongs to wag n wash!! And so does mine! Oh and also. My dogs love it too!!!!!!!!

I love this place but I am so unhappy right now. I have told them a million times and have stressed it a million times that I have to have decaf. They are the best coffee I've ever had and the service is superb but today after I say DECAF numerous times at every order because I am on meds that I can't have caffeine i was  given a four shot caffeine Carmelizer. I'm now a mess and my whole day is ruined and couldn't go out with my family..  Here is my update. I went to Dutch brothers to talk to manager about how sick I ended up being from getting served a caffeine drink and how sick I was from it.  I was very nice explaining the situation to a young kid that works there as I was trying to get a manager's phone number.  The kid with a tall skinny guy with a after five shadow beard wearing a bandana pink tights and shorts named spencer  gave me a wrong number. I called as I was pulling out of the parking lot I then turned around and went back and told him he gave me the wrong number and he said to me "listen lady you really getting under my skin" who says that to a customer who is asking for a managers phone number due to being extremely sick all day? I asked him for his name of which he said he didn't have to tell me. I walked away and said your manager will be hearing from me of which he yelled across the parking lot while laughing "good luck"!!!! I am truly disgusted at this behavior and I will never return again. I did talk to the manager josh who was really wonderful and offered me a 15 dollar gift card and said he had a talk with the employees about making sure if a customer says decaf it IS decaf. It's a dangerous thing. However he considered spencer family so I can only assume he got a slap on the wrist for treating a customer so very poorly. It's inexcusable how he treated me on too of how sick I probably looked after puking and shaking all day.  I won't go back cause I would be really afraid of spencer retaliating and giving me caffeine again. Which sucks cause their coffee is the best.

Wow. After giving them another chance after staying away for a year I was just handed ANOTHER caffeine filled drink!!! After saying PLEASE PLEASE NO CAFFEINE I AM NOW SUFFERING AGAIN. I I'll say the past few days I escaped with them not giving me  caffiene but once again there's a jerk who doesn't care what affects can happen to people sensitive to it. It's really disappointing because I like their drinks.

Ok I have to leave another update....I just went for coffee again because I subject myself to the possible dose of caffeine because I LOVE their coffee. They have the best iced mocha's ever! I will not order unless there is no line and I can see the machine they get the decaf from. I know.. It seems like a lot of work for a coffee but that's how good it is! Laney (spelling) recognized who I was when we were chatting about the allergy to caffeine and she knew it was me writing the review and she understood why I did and she was SO AWESOME! I told her I was for sure updating my review because she took the time to talk to me about the issue and told me to contact her if I ever had any issues... I have to say its good customer service! I will be back if there is no line!! Best coffee ever!

Very overpriced and VERY VERY rude. Just left a sale. Wish I would have never spent my hard earned 20 dollars. Will not go back again. They make it feel as if you are a complete burden to them and snicker at you wanting a few dollars off. My total for some used towels a sheet and egg slicer and thermometer was TWENTY THREE dollars!!!! They wouldn't even do 20 dollars. Never ever will I go back

Best place I have ever had my hair done.  Danielle really knows her stuff! My hair was pretty much black and in two visits managed to get my hair super blonde with not one broken piece of hair! How is that possible??? Because she's that GOOD!  she doesn't double book. When you are in her chair that's it. It's all attention on you. That was a big deal to me. I've had broken damaged hair when left under dryers with bleach while a hair stylist cuts other people's hair. Not good. And that would never ever happen with Danielle. If you want to go blonde. She's your girl!!! My hairstylist for life!

I can not stand this place!!!   I asked them to put a hold on my account when they called for the hundredth time because the money wasn't debiting out. I explained I need it on hold because I can't afford it.  I WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN. I'm canceling my card right now because they took the money out anyway and caused me to over draft due to me having my regular bills coming out too.  They don't care about anything but getting money.  Typical corporate business.  I will make it my duty to let everyone know about their practices. Facebook. Instagram. Google. Yelp. Any social media I can inform.   DONT SIGN CONTRACTS WITH THEM THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO HELP YOU ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO STARS
