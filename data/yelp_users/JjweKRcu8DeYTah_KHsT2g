My car was overheating and the closest place I could think to take it was this Pep Boys. Let's make a long story short...they quoted me almost $700 because "all of my hoses needed to be replaced" along with my thermostat and a coolant flush. Not to mention they were going to charge me EXTRA for a warranty on the parts which is absolutely ludicrous. After talking to a trusted mechanic (who doesn't live in AZ) I took it for a second opinion to Shadow Mountain Auto Service. It was a bit of a drive but I made it. After all, they're yelp reviews are nothing but raving fans. A trusted, hard working, friendly auto business. Not only did they quote me $300 less than Pep Boys but they told me they couldn't find anything wrong with my hoses. It seems to me that Pep Boys DOESN'T do everything for less or even with integrity, for that matter.

Shortly after posting this review someone from Pep Boys requested I email them about the situation at hand. Would you guess I received NO response?! What a crock. Save yourself and do not bring your car to THIS Pep Boys Service Center!

The Armadillo Grill is where it's at for Philly Cheese Steaks! My boyfriend and I have searched high and low through Phoenix seeking out a better Philly and have yet to find it. I mean, it's not the prettiest place but who cares? If you want to relax and get your grub on, do a little off-track betting and drink an ice cold beer, this is your place. We often take family and friends here for a low key yummy dinner and boozin'. The service is always great and you're likely to have the owner stop by and ask you how your meal was. I love that:) It's a big place with a big bar and plenty of TV's. It's easy to miss so keep your eyes peeled!!

I've been to this location quite a few times and I usually find at least 1 little gem! On my first trip I found a cute cream colored banana republic v-neck that I wear often on a night out or on a lunch date on a Sunday afternoon! My best find so far was my brand new (I mean they were BRAND NEW) black nine west pointy toe pumps. And it just so happened that on this weekend ALL 'non-designer' shoes were half off! I thought $16 was already a steal but to my surprise...$8. EIGHT DOLLARS? JACKPOT! Recenty I bought a cute pair of used cream and brown peep toe pumps that I fully intend to take full advantage of. Ladies, the best part of my sisters closet is the mens 'Well Suited' next door...so send your BF on his way and you can meet up when you're both done shopping:)

Honest, Reliable and Hard Working. 3 things we all look for in a mechanic but rarely find. This specific Pep Boys location meets all of those standards. New management has really turned this store around and kept me coming back time after time. It's nice to feel like you can take your car in and not be jerked around for the almighty dollar. 5 Stars, 2 Thumbs Up!

The most tasteless mexican food I've ever had.   I gave the 2 stars because the service was great considering we went as a large party. Everything came out in a timely fashion and correctly. Our server was also really nice.  But the food is awful. Just terrible. Kind of defeats the purpose of it being a restaurant... Just sayin'.

I've decided to make this one short and sweet...  The Menu - Too Small. The Food - Good, but nothing special. The Service - Stellar. The Aesthetics - Cute, 5&Diner-ish, CRAMPED! The Wait - Too long & clearly not worth it.  Just because Guy Fieri ate here...Puh-leeze. 2 Stars because I genuinely appreciate a warm and attentive wait staff.

Had dinner here this evening with some family from out of town. Stellar. Split the Fresh Mozzarella, Fig & Prosciutto and Manchego Bruschetta. All wonderful. The guys both ordered the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, sister-in-law ordered the scallops and I ordered the spicy shrimp risotto. I had a bite of each and believe me when I say you can't go wrong with any of those entrees! Our server was friendly and made lots of recommendations and my boyfriend and sister-in-law both agreed the bartender made a mean Dirty Martini:) Overall a solid experience. Atmosphere feels upscale while still being casual, we'll definitely be back!

I LOVE Kincaids! Especially with the updated decor and menu, you just can't go wrong. Not to mention they have an incredible happy hour. Half off all appetizers, $4 drafts (including Guinness, WHAT?!) $4 glasses of wine and select specialty drinks. This is a great place to go if you're looking for a different spot before a game or concert, even just a night out Downtown. The regular dining menu definitely doesn't dissapoint either - some of the freshest seafood and perfectly seared steaks! Clam chowder, French Onion Soup, even the salads. This place just knows how to do it. Can't wait to head back for happy hour soon. :)

Jason's Deli is always solid. You have to try the French Onion Soup w/ their awesome salad bar. I also enjoy their "Wrapinis" and the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich(SO GOOD!) Everything is FRESH!   The staff at this particular Jason's Deli is always fast and friendly and the restaurant is very clean!   Great, quick lunch spot!!

As a woman I've always been a little weary of taking my car to get looked at in fear of being taken advantage of. (i.e. There's a tiny mythological creature in your exhaust) Anyone? ... Anyway. I called 180 early in the week and made an appt. for that Friday. I was greeted by Cory who was very friendly and they immediately started looking at my car while I waited. They have a nice little sitting area with some magazines and even a YELP! Sticker on their window:) I was there for 15-20 mins when Cory explained to me that my water pump was leaking and I was lucky it hadn't caused any extensive damage. Not only did they not charge me to diagnose my problem (like all these big dealerships  usually do) but Cory took it upon herself to find out if my powertrain warranty covered this problem over to the second owner. It did! So I took my car to the dealership and the problem was fixed that day. For free. Awesome.

It's unfortunate that this is the closest WalMart to me because it is literally the worst Walmart EVER! Not only is there ALWAYS a line because there's never enough employees working but you can count on some idiot in the 20 items or less line with MORE THAN 20 ITEMS! Did I mention the clientele is HORRIBLE?! Whoever manages this Walmart needs to open their eyes! ::Written while waiting in line at THIS VERY WALMART!!::

I had seen The Main Ingredient on channel 10 news one morning and had been wanting to try it for a while. Went on a Saturday for lunch and the patio was packed and it was windy so we decided to sit inside. Love the modern decor and the way everything was set up. The music was awesome and we heard an upbeat version of John Legend singing 'Ordinary People' in Spanish but it was SO loud I almost felt like I was yelling. The artichoke dip was great! Huge chunks of artichoke and light on the cheese unlike your usual heavy mayo, heavy cheese, full of oil and sits on the bottom of your stomach dip. I had the Charli2na (I think that's how it was spelled) on sourdough with kettle chips. Very good and the bread was really fresh! My other half had The Sheridan. OMG!! Amazing! So flavorful! Turkey, genoa salami, cheddar cheese and greens on a fresh roll. I immediately said, 'This is like a party in your mouth!!' Also they had coca cola with real sugar cane in a bottle. Tastes SO much better! Overall, everything was wonderful but I would turn the music down just a smidge. Considering that it's a pretty small place:)

Well, the boyfriend and I decided to make a second trip here last night. Sad to say that we didn't have such a great experience this time. We sat outside on the patio because it was a gorgeous night. There weren't very many other patrons so I don't know why it took our server forever to come over. We explained that we WEREN'T in a hurry and that we would probably have a few beers and ordered an appetizer and an entree. The beers took a while to come out and the appetizer came out shortly after. Now, the food was definitely not the problem. It certainly did not dissapoint even this time. But a few bites into the appetizer the sandwich comes out and we've barely gotten into the app let alone we've hardly had a chance to touch our drinks!! We both agreed we would have rather had them just hold the sandwich for us while we had some time to get through the beginning of our meal. Here's the cherry topping...with the sandwich we had a choice of greens or chips. I swear we practically said in stereo, CHIPS. We didn't get chips. As a matter of fact, we didn't even get our server back to say, 'We ordered chips.' So we ate the greens with balsamic dressing (did not dissapoint, even though it's not what we ordered), finished our sandwich and beers and decided we did not want to spend any more money at an establishment that was going to give us crappy service. Needless to say, I doubt we'll be back any time soon. Which sucks. Because the food is great. :-/

They even seemed genuinely concerned about me driving up there and told me to keep in touch and call them if I happened to need a tow. I'm so glad I decided to get a second opinion. Thanks Shadow Mountain for being so kind, greeting me by name and understanding that all anyone wants is an honest mechanic.

Lived here for a year and moved in around the same time as Phillip M. and completely agree with everything he said. Seemed great, cheap rent, WAS quiet... The moron who moved in above me would play really loud soundtrack type of music that came through my ceiling at all hours. It was weird because you could hear it ringing through the halls too but no matter who I spoke to, nothing was done about it. That's another thing, don't try to call the office because no one physically there will answer. You will more than likely be forwarded to their central office. Cell phone reception BLOWS because of those huge parking structures and if there's a baseball game in town, just forget it. The first day I moved in my feet were black from the kitchen floor...really? And then upon move out I was charged an extra $35 on top of the mandatory carpet cleaning fee for a "Stain Removal." Well, you know what Camden Copper Square, that stain was from all the crap that was tracked in from your disgusting parking garages. And last but not least, when I asked about the option to go month to month when my lease was up I was quoted an amount that was THREE TIMES what I paid monthly for my tiny 600 sq ft apartment.   They LOVE to boast - "In 2010, FORTUNE® Magazine recognized Camden as one of the "100 Best Companies to Work For" in the country! Listed this year at #10"  What about living there...?

I have found my new tailor! For starters, Randall and Dennis offered to stay after they closed because I couldn't leave work until 5:30 so I could come in and have them pin some work shirts for me. Dennis is chatty and funny and I love that. That same day the hem on my pants (that someone else had done and overcharged me for) came undone and he offered to fix it before I left for their first time hem price of $7. Long story short, $15 per shirt and an amazing job. Dennis even remembered my face when I walked in to pick them up and I was greeted with "Hey Girl!" LOVE it! I will be back in the future for more of my tailoring needs. Thanks Guys! A+++

Oh man! Decided to "take-out" with the mister on a whim tonight and we are SO glad we did. Talk about a money street taco... We tried the Pollo, Asada, Al Pastor and Chorizo. I probably wouldn't get the chorizo again because there's just something about it for me that feels more 'breakfasty' but it was still great. The salsas were spicy without being overwhelming and I loved the crispy, grilled soft tacos. Not much to look at inside but we will definitely be back for the food. At $2/Taco I would've been fine eating just 2 and 3 1/2 put me over the edge! Definitely recommend it!

My 9 month old Basset mix was in desperate need of her first haircut. I was slightly apprehensive because, as you may know, puppies are afraid of everything!   My now 4 year old Terrier mix has had a couple poor experiences with PetSmart so it was time to find a new groomer. Upon doing my research Wag N' Wash Scottsdale had at least 4.5 Stars everywhere, from Yahoo to Google to Foursquare to Yelp! The employee (Kate, I think) who took my original phone call was very friendly and sounded upbeat on the phone which I liked. She put me at ease when I expressed my concerns of this being her first grooming session.  On Sunday at 10am we were welcomed by Lindsey who was to be her groomer. She was great and asked what exactly I was looking for and offered some suggestions which I loved. She mentioned it could take up to 3 hours which I had already planned on. I hated seeing my little girl be nervous to go with a stranger as I left...  Only 2 hours later I got a phone call from Lindsey that Lola was ready! When I arrived to pick her up she was smiling and bouncy and so happy! They told me that she did wonderfully and they didn't have any issues. I will definitely be bringing our 4 year old mix here for her next cut. They also carry the girls favorite treats, "Fruitables." As I can't find these at PetSmart anymore I grabbed 2 bags, paid for everything together and signed up for their rewards program!  Great experience, lovely, clean store and friendly people.  Thanks Wag N' Wash Scottsdale!
