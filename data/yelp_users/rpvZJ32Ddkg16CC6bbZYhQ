Large selection of sugar free flavors and even larger selection of regular flavors! Their sugar-free is also flavored with stevia which I prefer over aspartame and other sweeteners. The portions are HUGE and the ice is perfect! Fine and powdery, just like eating real snow. They get 4 stars because of the time I got a side by side sugar free banana and sugar free toasted coconut, and my banana was definitely not sugar free. I was on a strict diet at the time and could not have ANY sugar. I called and the manager I spoke with basically told me I was wrong and that it was sugar free. He didn't offer to compensate me, offer me a free treat, or even a free punch on my card. I will continue to patronize them because that is the only issue I've ever had, but I can't forget it.

China China is the best chinese food in the valley and basically anywhere as far as I'm concerned. It is fresh, inexpensive, delicious, and the service is always friendly and fun. They always remember us when we come in. The flaming volcano bowl is a must try. My favorite dishes are the Kung Pao (shrimp, scallops, beef, chicken... anything really), the crispy garlic shrimp, and the house pan fried noodles. I can't say enough good things about China China.

What can I say? I love Jamba Juice. Cold, fruity, delicious, fast. Can't go wrong with this place! Surf Rider is the best smoothie that they always have. Last summer they had a yumberry smoothie that was to die for, but sadly it was a seasonal promotion only. Aloha Pineapple is also amazing!

Last night was my first time at The Dhaba and I will definitely be back! We had a reservation for 3 at 7:30 on a Wednesday night and were not seated until after 8pm. This is my ONLY complaint about the restaurant after eating there. It was definitely worth the wait.  We ordered Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Korma, Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Vindaloo, and rice and naan, of course. The portions look small, and we did not take home any leftovers, but we were full to the point of bursting when we left. We also had a bottle of wine, and I intended to try the Chai Masala but I will have to save it for next time.   The meal itself was by far the best indian food I have ever had. I tend to gravitate more towards masalas and vindaloos for the most part, and theirs were excellent, but I was absolutely blown away by the Korma. Nutty, creamy, sweet, spicy - perfect! I scraped the bowl and my plate clean with naan, and will go back for this dish alone over and over and over again.  The service was friendly, helpful while ordering, and unobtrusive throughout the rest of the meal, which I like. My water stayed full and that was all I needed.   Having to wait after making a reservation was initially somewhat off-putting, but this minor annoyance was forgiven the moment we tried the food. Maybe next time we will make a reservation slightly earlier than we want to eat.

Updating with an extra star because we went back today with a reservation at 6 and were sat immediately. The food was heaven and the korma was maybe even better than last time!

A few months back I went to Il Vinaio on a whim for supper with a friend of mine. The restaurant was nearly empty, but our waiter was excellent, our food was served promptly and was delicious. I also ordered a glass of Sangria which was heavenly. I half-joked to the waiter that I wanted to buy a gallon of the stuff to take home with me for a get together I was having that night, and the waiter and staff were so accommodating. They sent me home with 5 freshly made bottles of sangria and a container of fresh sliced fruit garnish. It was a very good experience and I have been trying to get some of my friends to join me for a meal there ever since.  Well, last week I got together a group of 8 diners and we decided to go there for dinner. Two of the diners would be enjoying their last dinner there before returning home to England. I realized several hours before dinner that there would be an Oktoberfest Beer dinner that evening, and called to make sure that regular service would be offered. It was, and I reserved a table for 7pm. Three people were there right on time, and the rest of the party arrived a little bit late but staggered, no later than 7:20. I'm not sure if our waitress had never waited table before, or was just highly incompetent at her job, but the entire meal was a disaster from the beginning. The beer dinner taking place in the center of the restaurant was not as busy as I had expected it to be, and there might have been a couple of other tables in the restaurant, I'm not sure. Our waitress didn't get all of our orders taken until after 7:45. Bread arrived 10 minutes later, stale and cold. A couple of friends ordered pitchers of Sangria, which was not quite as good as the batch that I'd purchased previously, but still very good. However, the pitchers were tiny, filled to the top with ice, and $34 each. Most of our water glasses remained empty for long periods at a time while our waitress was nowhere to be found. The food was also very inconsistent with my first visit - I had tried the mac and cheese which was delicious and rich, and my friend that ordered it received a bowl of runny cheese-milk with noodles in it. The sauce on the mac and cheese was identical to the "fondue" appetizer she'd ordered. I ordered a grilled flatbread with cappicola, and what arrived was a glorified tortilla with some cheese and ham sprinkled on top. It was not a $12 meal. Some of the food was delicious, but the inconsistency was truly astounding. My husband's sirloin burger was cooked perfectly and was delicious. Another friend ordered the antelope burger, and stated that he preferred his meat as rare as possible, but as he'd never eaten antelope he would like the chef to prepare the burger as he recommend it be eaten. The burger came out well done, tough, and underseasoned. I also had this item on my first visit, ordered medium, and it was perfect. Our food did take a very long time to come out, which I could attribute to the kitchen being tied up cooking for the beer dinner. However, we were a large, paying party who made sure that regular service would be an option before we came. There were so many more issues with the food and service. I was appalled that I had so highly recommended the restaurant and taken a large group there. It was a disappointing meal for every single member of our party. This review would be much longer if I detailed each member's order and the multiple issues with each.  I am not a confrontational person. I have worked in food service before and the experience we had was inexcusable. My husband picked up our portion of the check and I left as a couple of our more confrontational party members said something to the waitress. Nothing was comped, no apology was given or explanation made, and none of us will be back. I had such high hopes for this restaurant after my first visit. I am saddened that my second experience was so disastrous. Downtown Mesa needs good local businesses and restaurants, and I was so excited that this would be one. If this is a typical experience I expect they won't last another year. Please, show me this was a fluke!

I love The Royale! Located in the heart of Downtown Mesa, this awesome movie theatre shows a wide variety of movies you won't find anywhere else. The atmosphere is great, the staff is lovely, and the movies are fun! Go out today and support this wonderful gem of a local business.
