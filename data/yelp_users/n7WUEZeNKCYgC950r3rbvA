The Sahara is On The Strip. I like that in an LV hotel. Also, it has a monorail station downstairs, which can take you down The Strip, to any number of OTHER cool hotels.  I think I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for The Sahara, though. I liked how they put your name on the television set, welcoming you to your room. I also liked that they made decent drinks in the casino... you know, the free ones you get while gambling?  PLUS, I won over $500 here in one day, which is pennies to some people, but for a novice like me, it was A LOTTA DOUGH!!! I was totally kvelling over my winnings! There were a mix of people in this place, too... young, middle-aged, old.... though not as many old people as were at The Plaza.   My hubby, sister, her friend, my mom and my new step dad all had a great time here! The food in the restaurants wasn't bad, either. The breakfast buffet upstairs was actually pretty darned cool, even though it's in a cafeteria-like setting. They had anything you could ever want for breakfast, and it's 'all you can eat', which is why we go to Vegas in the first place, baby!  The Sahara is a bargain for a Strip hotel. I recommend it! (Just don't expect fancy shampoos or soaps in your room, or mints on your pillow. At least the rooms didn't REEK like the ones in The Plaza.)  Go, have fun. Win some money! Just save some for ME!!!

HAUNTED!! (tm Kristina R)  .... Not.  My husband and I, along with a couple that we're friends with, stayed at this old Las Vegas hotel for three days. We had seen on TV that supposedly Houdini's ghost haunts this place. The only haunting that I experienced is the "ghost of cigarettes past". Ugh. Our room (which was 'nonsmoking') smelled like we were actually sleeping inside an ashtray. I think I might've gotten a nicotine addiction just from hanging out in our hotel room!  The place is run down, the guests here all are at the lower end of the economic scale, and about 20 years older than us on average, but you know what? We still had fun! I played my favorite slot machine: WHEEL! OF! FORTUUUUUNE!!! Yeah, baby, I made bank, too! I must've won at least $200 in quarters, and only put in about $40 of my own money to start... after that I played off my winnings. I came home with $180, which to me, is fantabuloso!   I also played some roulette, and stayed at the table for quite some time (a couple hours) before I skedaddled with my winnings... a whopping $80. Hey, I doubled my money... how many of you can say THAT? (I always bring only $40 to a table. Never more. It's a hard and fast rule of mine.)  The diner inside the hotel was... well, a diner. It had diner type fare. Not bad. Not great, either, but satisfying.  The Plaza is right at the end of Fremont Street, though, which is a fun place to walk around at night, when it's all lit up and they have music going. There are lots of old casinos here that are probably haunted, too, from the looks of them. Old. Decrepit. Stinky. Yeah, they MUST be haunted! We didn't see any ghosts.... or DID we??  But we won't be staying here again.... it's too far from the strip, and it was kind of a bummer to have to walk to the bus stop, ride the hot bus for 20 minutes, and then peel yourself off the seats when you reach the Strip. Not too glamourous.   If you're into "old school Vegas", where you might run into the ghost of Dean Martin, or Old Blue Eyes, then by all means, stay at The Plaza. If you want to be close to the shows, fountains, and general youthful glitter of Vegas, though, best to stay somewhere on The Strip.

I had a nice experience in this hotel. I had to stay for a work conference, for three days and two nights. They were friendly and courteous, and it was easy to check in and out. No hassles.  In the nice rooms, there was a little bag with complimentary ear plugs, an eyemask, lavendar sheet spritzer and also a CD that you can listen to to help you fall asleep easier! That was new for me! The bathrooms had granite countertops and were very clean.  I received two dozen red roses from my husband while I was visiting (well, it's not like I wasn't going to announce this to the world, right?!) and they brought them up to my room with big smiles. It was so sweet! I couldn't take them all with me, so I left them with the front desk, who thanked me profusely and happily arranged them in the lobby. I kept one to take home with me and it just barely survived the trip!  The food and conference service was nice. They served us a full breakfast on the first morning, and a continental on the second/last morning. The lunches were buffet style, also, and were sandwiches and salads the first day and a Mexican spread the second day. All were quite tasty. Especially the Mexican food!   The one downside is that there were  150 of us, and there was never enough bottled water put out. It would be gone in half an hour and not to be replenished until after the next meal. since I don't drink sodas, and coffee only in the morning, that meant that I had to keep getting up with my plastic cup and refilling with water at the water kegs they had in the back, which can get disruptive when you have seventy or so people doing that.  Also, the air was kept quite cool so that I was shivering half the time. I'd look around, and even some of the men were cold. That's saying something. We're in Phoenix in the fall, and yes, it's hot out, but inside should be kept at a normal temperature around 70-72 degrees, right? It was about 65. Brrr!  Their shuttle service was efficient and friendly, also. The lounge was smoky and dark, as most lounges are, but the service was also friendly there.   All in all, it was a very pleasant experience! I would recommend any one to stay here if they're in the area. It's not luxury, but it's clean, up to date, and friendly!
