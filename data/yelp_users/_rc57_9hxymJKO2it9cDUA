I've been here a handful of times and always had a pleasant experience. Until I went to the brunch. We had 6 people and reservations, so we were seated immediately. I thought we waited slightly longer then we should have to place our orders, but everyone is talking & having fun so I wouldn't mark that against them. I didn't see any $5 cocktails as mentioned in another review. That is something I usually enjoy in most central Phx brunch spots.  So we order and no joke it took 1 hour to get our food. The server never once apologized or even commented about the wait until we asked. He told us since we were a large party the kitchen gets backed up. 6? Is a large enough party to throw off the entire kitchen? When we did finally get our food, 4 of us were served and the other 2 waited for 5 more min.... Even though they were the same dishes as the next person.  The food was good, never had a problem with that part.  This is when we probably bothered the server by asking him to split charges on 4 different cards. 2 were a couple & 1 had cash. Gratuity was included so we told him exact amount to charge on every card. Equally divided, doubled for the couple. He took the time to identify who's card belonged to who, but when he rang it up, realized it didn't add up (cuz of missing cash) instead of walking the 10 feet to table to double check, he decided to divide it evenly among cards. Ugh we already had this figured out. He came back and everyone was upset about it. He then got snippy and said well I have to refund everyone and redo it. Yes you do. A simple walk over when amounts didn't match up would have saved a lot of time. I allowed myself 1hr & 45 min to have brunch and get to my next engagement. 2hrs and 15 min later we were still getting the check mess figured out. This was not due to lingering & drinking. This was how long it took to get us food and get us out the door.  I really should have spoke to the manager, but I just didn't want to be the a second longer. I was over an hour late to next event :(

All around Excellent. Cleanliness, friendliness and especially professionalism. Shane is very thorough in his consultation. Educates you on how to treat piercing and what to expect. He is the only piercer I would trust for myself & my family. Highly recommend him to anyone looking for a piercing!

Just went to "Tony's". New owners straight from Chicago. Had great pizza and my family enjoyed real saucy wings. Gave us all free samples of the Italian ice. Yummy! Also enjoyed the conversation. These are the nicest guys you will meet! Open late & delivery. They just took it over do they are going to be redoing the interior. Support local business and really good people. Give it a try!
