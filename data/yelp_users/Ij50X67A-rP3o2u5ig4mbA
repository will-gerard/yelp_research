Gorgeous jewelry!! I have purchased all my favorite pieces here!! Amazing piercer!! She has done everything I currently have pierced(tragus, daith, helix[x3], and septum) on 3 different visits. Each visit was clean, comfortable and professional. :))

I hired A Wise Move and I must say they did an impeccable job! I work in an industry where good work is appreciated and people return to me based on the work I do for them and I will be recommending A Wise Move to everyone I get the opportunity to! I am so incredibly pleased with the move! And @ a reasonable price! SOOOOOO worth it! I will be using this company the next time I need to move!

If I could give 0 stars I would. I came into c&r tire on May 24, 2014 and replaced all 4 tires. I was never offered a warranty and the tire was damaged within 7 days and under 400 miles. The owner, Ralph, was extremely rude to me and actually expected me to pay for a new tire!! He claims I declined the road hazard warranty when it was never offered. I have been a discount tire customer for years and thought it was strange no warranty was offered at c&r. I know that they have an all new staff as the 79.91 cash(of the 429.91) I paid was never received(stolen by employee) and I was given a call within a few days asking me to come pay this amount again. Employees are thieves and apparently it is a learned trait from their owner. I am a business owner and I stand behind my product for at least 2 weeks!! I will never do business with c&r tire again and bad word of mouth passes so much faster than good word of mouth.

Why don't you charge a little more and then you could do a better job. I would rather pay a little more to have my steering wheel cleaned and the inside of my windshield since it seems to get missed everytime! Pretty obvious stuff. Won't come back here EVER again as both times we've been here we have ended up having to fork out money to have some "new" problem fixed.
