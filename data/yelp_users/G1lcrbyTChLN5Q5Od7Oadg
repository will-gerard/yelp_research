After a fiasco at dinner, we walked over to the Sugar Bowl for some dessert since sugar makes everything better.  Love the old school look and feel to this ice cream parlor - you feel as if this place was frozen in time. Get it? :)  Choose from a large selection of ice cream scoops, build your own sundae or get a shake, soda or float - tons to choose from! The mint chocolate ice cream is great - large chunks of bittersweet chocolate. Next time I'd love to try the sorbets.   They also serve soups and sandwiches for those wanting something savory before enjoying dessert.  What is neat about this place is that there is a small game room in the back with air hockey, basketball hoop game, skeeball, etc.   One gripe: We had fun playing a ton of games with our young cousin and thought it would be fun to redeem our tickets for one of the "prizes" in the cases. No staff was in the game room, and there is a note clearly stating to go out front for service. We tracked someone down and after waiting for 20 minutes or so, no one ever came back to help us. It was not busy at the ice cream shop, so not sure what the delay was.   Overall a tasty, fun experience when in Old Town!

We recently stayed here and were pleasantly surprised! This location is not far from the Las Vegas strip (less than a 5 minute drive) however a car is really convenient to have here. That being said, if you don't have a car, you can take the monorail at LVH which is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel.  This hotel definitely reminded me much more of a nice condo than a hotel. We stayed in a one bedroom suite on the top floor and it was really clean, completely renovated and best of all, quiet!   The suite had an open layout with granite counter tops and stainless steel appliances in the kitchen equipped with bowls, utensils, etc. and a really spacious living room, bedroom and bathroom and free WiFi. I joked with my husband that I could happily live here. Had we stayed here longer, we definitely would have gone to the grocery store and made some of our meals here; this would be a great option for a longer stay in Vegas or if you have a large family or kids.  There were two large flat screen TVs in the suite, large Jacuzzi tub (if you're into those) and comfortable king size bed. My favorite though was the bathroom: double sinks, a walk-in shower with excellent water pressure, great toiletries and best of all, very clean.  Downstairs there is game room, a small coffee shop, and a pool with a BBQ pit area. Unfortunately it was a bit cool for us to hit the pool but I'd love to come back in the warmer months and take advantage of this nice outdoor area.  Unlike most hotels in Vegas, you won't find valet parking (although the parking lot is so huge it is not a problem) and one night we had to request a cab from the front desk since there is not usually a large cab stand outside of this hotel.   Would love to stay here again - in addition to a great room, friendly service too - highly recommend!

A gluten free diner's gem in Las Vegas! This place was SO good that we went to 2 out of their 4 locations while on vacation over the weekend.   We stopped by this location on the first day and the service was fast and friendly and I was impressed at how familiar with gluten-free dining my server was. I also loved that they have a separate gluten free menu which you can request.  SO many gluten free breakfast options! Choose from scrambles, to omelettes, skillets and gluten-free pancakes. On my visit here I was so excited for all of these options that I ordered a bit too much food so beware, the portions are quite large.  At this location I tried the Southwest Scramble which consisted of eggs, chorizo, green peppers, pickled jalapenos, onions and a side of salsa. All eggs come with a side of hash browns or seasoned potatoes and gluten free toast! I was glad the server (as well as the menu) mentioned that the bread was toasted in a non-gluten-free toaster; however they will happily grill it for you to avoid contamination. The scramble was super tasty but the hash browns stole the show - perfectly seasoned and crispy!   I also ordered two gluten-free pancakes and they were excellent - large, fluffy and a little crispy on the edges - could not tell they were gluten free!  My husband who does not have any dietary restrictions also loved this place, especially since they serve you a huge chunk of warm, delicious coffee cake with your eggs! I was jealous but was more than elated with my own meal.  Will most definitely return here if ever in Vegas again - especially since I saw that they also have gluten free lunch options such as burgers and sandwiches.

A gluten free diner's gem in Las Vegas! This place was SO good that we went to 2 out of their 4 locations while on vacation over the weekend. This location in particular was our second stop at a Cracked Egg location.  There was a bit of a wait at this location on a Sunday, but they still moved the line pretty quickly. This location also has a great outdoor patio dining area which unfortunately was full. We waited for no longer than 10 minutes and service was super-fast and friendly! Tip: If there is a long wait, you can sit at the counter and not wait at all. Another plus about this location: our meals came out really quickly! So quickly that even our waitress said it was quick! Given that we were famished, we definitely appreciated that.  Having been through the drill at their other location, I requested the gluten free menu and was excited to try yet another meal here. SO many gluten free breakfast options! Choose from scrambles, to omelettes, skillets and gluten-free pancakes.   At this location I tried the Lighten Up scramble which consisted of egg whites, with turkey, diced green peppers and a side of salsa. All eggs come with a side of hash browns or seasoned potatoes and gluten free toast! I was glad the server (as well as the menu) mentioned that the bread was toasted in a non-gluten-free toaster; however they will happily grill it for you to avoid contamination. The scramble was delicious - the ingredients tasted really fresh and light. I ordered the hash browns again because they are so darn good - perfectly seasoned and crispy!   My husband who does not have any dietary restrictions also loved this place, especially since they serve you a huge chunk of warm, delicious coffee cake with your eggs!   Will most definitely return here if ever in Vegas again - especially since I saw that they also have gluten free lunch options such as burgers and sandwiches.

We recently dined here for my husband's birthday. Having been at the Mastro's in Scottsdale, we knew what to expect: tasty appetizers, good drinks, and even better steak, so we were excited to check out this location.  The restaurant itself is in a unique setting: inside the high-end Crystal mall in the ARIA in a wooden tree house sculpture - pretty unique! I will say that having dinner while being able to look out at the Fendi & Louis Vuitton store did seem to downplay the high-end feel of this restaurant and it made me really annoyed (I know, hater) at all the women walking around with their Chanel & Prada shopping bags.  We were promptly seated outside of the tree house in the booths and as usual, service was second to none. They were aware of the gluten-free dining note on our Open Table reservation and brought me the Gluten Free Menu which is pretty large and almost mirrors the regular menu with a few exceptions and some alterations.  Large signature cocktail, beer and wine menu - I liked that they denoted which cocktails were gluten free as this is usually a place in the gluten-free menus restaurants ignore. Stunning and colorful bar - my husband liked the large selection of craft beers as well. The two TVs flanking the bar though did seem out of place.  For a starter, the shrimp cocktail is a great choice: presentation is really cool with the dry ice vapor, the shrimp are HUGE and the sauce is good. For an entrée, I went with the filet. Instead of their regular rub which contains gluten, they will season it with salt & black pepper. It was a huge portion (had I known, I would have ordered the small filet) and it was cooked well and they even did a butterfly cut to ensure it cooked through. I also ordered a side of green beans with sliced almonds - tasty & fresh however, there were no almonds...   Our waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgeable and did a great job of checking up on us despite a busy Saturday night.  He was even nice enough to bring out some chocolate covered strawberry with whipped cream on the house to celebrate my husband's birthday which was even more thoughtful because he made sure it was a dessert I could eat given my gluten-free diet.  We had an awesome time, with superb food and drinks and top of the line service. Would highly recommend for a nice dinner, but be prepared to spend at least couple of hundred dollars on this indulgence!

This place is awesome for those looking for a healthy meal with super-fresh, sustainable and organic-farmed ingredients in a great open atmosphere. This is especially the case for those with dietary restrictions (gluten free, vegetarian, vegan).  Ate lunch here & the menu was clearly marked with gluten free items and their server was really knowledgeable. For starters they were able to sub the pita bread in the herb hummus for some veggies and it was excellent! The drink list is great as well - after a 4 hour flight, I opted for the Hangover Rx - a tasty concoction of coconut water, pineapple, vanilla and orange juice - so good and invigorating.  Next was the toughest decision of the day - what to order? I LOVED that their menu featured a "global" cuisine Tons to choose from including salads, pizza, sandwiches (they have gluten free buns!), and even some solid entrees! I was starving so ordered the margherita pizza and was able to get it with a gluten free crust.  Food came out quickly and everything tasted excellent! The pizza is definitely for one person and was super fresh, perfectly crispy crust (but not dry like some GF crusts) and not oily at all topped with organic tomatoes and plenty of basil - so good!   Extensive wine, beer and cocktail list - they even have sake!   The space is huge and open with the indoors featuring great décor featuring reclaimed wood, tons of windows and a great yellow and green color palette. You can also see the open kitchen (which always gives me peace of mind). Outdoors there are a ton of lounge /couch areas to dine- I recommend sitting outdoors.  This is on my must-dine list when back in Scottsdale. Great atmosphere, service and very knowledgeable about dietary restrictions so that you can sit back, relax, enjoy the open atmosphere and eat without any worries.  Would be AWESOME to have a location in Chicago!

Great place with super-fast & friendly service & plenty of great options (including gluten free).   We headed here on a Saturday morning for breakfast and as all the other reviews note, it was packed, and there were several people waiting for a table, especially since everyone was requesting indoor seating due to the chilly morning. Don't be turned off by this. Despite the wait we were seated in less than 10 minutes (what we were quoted) and after we ordered our food, it was out in less than 10 minutes.  Gluten free eaters, you are in luck. Choose from a variety of skillets, omelets, and egg scrambles as well as gluten free pancakes or gluten free Belgian waffles! I ordered the New Mexico skillet and chose the gluten free pancakes and a cup of fruit as sides. I was pleasantly surprised that there was no up-charge for the two GF pancakes as other places usually tack on at least $2 extra! Pancakes were really good - not super dry & crumbly as most GF pancakes tend to be and the skillet was spicy and tasty.   This is also a great breakfast option for those that have no dietary restrictions as they can also choose from some unique french toast options, french crepes, breakfast burritos and plenty of oatmeal options.  Service was on point - the minute our plates were done, they were picked up, our waters and coffee were filled like clock-work and this was all done without making us feel rushed at all.   Also, unlike a lot of other places in Scottsdale, this place was unpretentious, plenty of older people, kids, and college students clearly hung over in their pjs - no need to primp for this place. Would definitely stop by here again & try to eat out in the patio!

Dined here when out of town since we were looking for a good Mexican place in a neat place to dine with our younger cousin. Barrio Queen it was!  Our dinner experience started out with us waiting a while for the waitress to come by. Long story short: good (albeit pricey) food, neat ambiance, AWFUL customer service. The latter is enough to make us never come back.  We ordered several entrees and one of almost every taco to share. Really good chips, salsa and guacamole. My favorite tacos were the nopales and rajas tacos - great for vegetarians and for gluten free people like myself. Their horchata was also really good - although $5 per glass is REALLY steep, even for Scottsdale standards.  After slow service but an otherwise pleasant meal, we gave our waitress our credit card to pay our check and that's when the %&*# hit the fan. We waited for over 20 minutes for them to come back with our credit card to no avail. It wasn't until we looked over and saw about 5 people with flash lights and knives in a commotion, including our waitress. When she saw us looking over, she finally came over and told us she lost our credit card since it had fallen and got knocked under a large generator behind a wall. Accidents happen, sure, and we would have been TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING  had she apologized and said they were trying to get it out, however the first thing that came out of her mouth was, "so I'm sorry, I'm going to need another form of payment" to which my husband responded he would like to pay with the credit card he gave her. She then became upset and said it was an accident, and got even more mad when we asked to speak with a manager. At this point we have been sitting there for over 30 minutes.  We were heading back home the next day and having to potentially cancel the credit card on which our rental car was on and flight would be a great inconvenience, and could not wrap our heads around how neither the manager nor the waitress thought this was a big deal or how they could not conceive why we were upset. They asked us to "come back later" as they continued to look for the card but asked that we put down another card for them to charge in case they did not get it out. In hindsight, we shouldnt have done this. After going down the street for some dessert they finally called us to come pick up our card. No apology again, no nothing.   With so many good Mexican places in Scottsdale, no need to visit this place that seems to completely disregard customer service. First and last visit here - which is a bummer considering their food was pretty good.

The best thing about Isabella's by far is the beautiful atmosphere as there is plenty of outdoor seating facing out into the gorgeous golf course. We were able to sit on one of the couches on the patio with a fire pit - highly recommend!   Our server was super-friendly and was extremely accommodating to my gluten-free diet. While they do not have a separate gluten-free menu, he went back and verified with the chef what substitutions they could make to get me a GF meal. I was able to enjoy the Green Beans as an appetizer and the Kale salad.  The green beans were AMAZING - and the kale salad was really tasty and fresh as well with grapefruit and orange, roasted almonds and vinaigrette. They were able to add some grilled chicken to give it more substance too. The salad portion was HUGE - I kept eating it for over an hour and yet still barely made a dent.  They have a rooftop which looks pretty neat - would love to return here at night & see the stars & Phoenix lights.
