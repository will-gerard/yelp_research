I love Einstein bagels! This location SUCKS! The employees are rude and every single visit has been terrible! They ALWAYS get my order wrong! Today I ordered -- girl at the counter was nice enough! I pay for my order at the next counter and the women is nice as always. I wait for my order and see that it's all wrong--- I bring it back to the counter to report the issue and ask nicely fix it -- I get rolled eyes from the women at the counter then I get a huffy melt down by the girl on the food prep line. WOW, unprofessional and extremely poor customer service! People around me were blown away by the "mean girl" performance! Customer lost --- I will never be back to this location and plan on contacting the district manager! It's the principle!!!!! I paid $10 for a bagel and bottle of water -- I expect a nice place to dine and friendly customer centered people. They could tell how upset and saddened I was by their reaction to me and NO efforts were made to make the situation right.  This is not the Einstein's way -- I'm very disappointed but it's obvious if you hire rude careless people whom service your customers this morning then you're aware of the horrific attitudes and service they provide! I will never be back and hope those reading this will chose another bagels shop! Don't reward businesses that treat their customers so poorly!

Food is terrible but not as bad as the staff -- rude and complacent. It's basically a Latin inspired chuck-e-cheese! Do you're self a favor and go anywhere else! The management  is careless to complaints. Never going back ---

This location sucks! The staff are incredibly slow and just can't be bothered. Can I just say that I LOVE Einstein's bagels -- it is my all time favorite bagel and smoothie shop !!!!! This location is a huge disappointment. I will never go back to this location. Order a bagel and schmere and what felt like a life time pass before my bagel was done -- I was the only one there and it took almost 10 mins -- the two employees were too busy chatting with one another. I finally got my bagel and it was delish but I was too annoyed with the service to enjoy it. I then decided to get a drink before leaving. I stood at the register for almost 5 mins while the two young male employees where restocking the cold bar (a matter of a few feet from me) and would look up at me but NEVER offered to help or came over to take my order. I was dumbfounded. This place really needs an intervention. Wow! I finally just said OUT LOUD "I guess I will just not buy a drink" and went to leave. They looked right at me and did nothing so I left. It was so weird. VERY poor service. I am sad because I LOVE Einstein's bagels. I hope this location closes so no one else has to deal with this type of experience.

Huge after work meet up for drinks and dinner. We get there and it's empty -- literally not another table there. It took almost 10 mins just to get menus and someone to take out drink order.  I am going to make this quick and to the point -- I don't plan on returning to this hot mess. The service is incredibly incrediblyyyyyyyyyy slow and sloppy. The food sucks -- delivered cold. I would have complained but after delivering the food we didn't see the waiter for like 30 + mins.   To sum it up -- our waiter was also the bartender. Bad move on the part of the restaurant.  Food and services were terrible -- will not return.  Oh AND a couple at our large table left early. So when we went to pay our bill they told us that that couple never paid and asked if we were going to take care of it.  We called our friends to ask what happened -- they texted us a photo of the paid receipt!!!!!!!!! This restaurant is extremely poorly managed --- double charge??? Keep it classy Macayo's !!!

Excellent experience! I LOVE how my hair came out. Kasondra did my cut and color.  She was sweet and bubbly!   The salon is fabulous and chic. I just moved to the area from Boston so I am used to paying high Newbury street salon prices so in my opinion  altered egos prices are high for the average services. Clients are not offered a beverage (water). I paid $39 dollars for the hair cut and a total of about 50 hairs were cut off my head. It was weird. I asked for a minimal cut but assumed ALL the dry ends would be trimmed.   The receptionist that set my appointment over the phone was amazing! Soooo patient and kind!

AMAZINGGGGGGG!!!!!!  The food is amazing! Just a delicious spot to grab lunch (they have specials and are quick for a lunch time bite) or go for dinner!   OMG the food is delicious and they understand spice -- medium is actually medium -- "thai hot" is actually "thai hot" -- the food is just phenomenal!  The staff is friendly but can be flighty and a bit lost at the wheel at times so don't let that bother you -- go for the pad thai or curry !!!! Delish!!! T  If you got for luck they include a salad and soup bar and OMG it's good!!!   Try it -- you won't be sorry ;)

Will definitely be back!!

Food SUCKS! And was expensive for the offering -- it just sucks... First time here so I ordered the #1 3 taco combo ... Food was cold, uninspired and flavorless! Mexican tacos are about flavor and fresh zesty textures -- the tacos have none of that!  Void of any spice or flavor -- Will not be back!

Recently found this amazing taxi (more like car service) company! I love the convenience of booking the car service online. Both drivers have been very friendly and professional!! I love that I can book online in a snap! So easy! Plus the cars they send are always clean and fancy!   I have several more trips already booked in the next few weeks to the airport as I travel a lot for work. Plus they do airport pick up so I don have to go for a ride around easy valley with one of the other taxi companies -- no thank you after a long day of travel! The driver is always there to meet me and whisk me home in a flash -- and super reasonably priced.  I highly recommend the car service!!!  A++ service! They really care about their customers!   Give them a shot -- you will not be disappointed!

The food is terrible! My mom and sister went last week for lunch and loved it so we figured we would go for dinner. The restaurant was empty but the service was excruciatingly slow. Like 15 mins to get a beer or soda refill. We finally received the food after almost an hour and 5 of our 6 meals were cold. Not warm -- COLD!  We were so hungry by that point we took a few bites of the DRY cold Pulled pork and asked for to go boxes. What a waste of a night out with family.   Honestly the best thing about the meal was the basket of warm corn bread and butter we received while waiting for our drinks.  I will never be back -- huge disappointment!  The waitress Brittany was nice!

They fro-yo is not yummy at all. It's a total bummer. All flavors taste terribly and too sweet. I have gone twice --- thinking the first time was a fluke but it was terrible today too. The owner is very nice but the service is extremely slow. Ordering bobo tea takes 10/15 mins -- it's insane. There is nothing better than the plain vanilla tart fro-yo, it's a unique flavor. The tart plain vanilla at yummies is cloyingly sweet and a huge disappointment. Oh well -- there is always yogurt land (it's soooo delicious)
