Terrible service at this location. I have consistently gone in, and Sean the shift leader is a complete jerk to customers and workers alike. When I got home and told me husband about my experience today, he asked, "Is Sean the one with the longish hair? Yeah, I know who you are talking about. That guy sucks." I thought it was kind of funny my husband who has a terrible memory, remembers this kid by his awful service.  Today I went in, and asked if they had any more everything or cheese bagels, since the baskets were empty. Sean says he will check, huffs and walks away. He comes back and says no to the Everything, but they have the cheese bagel. I order a cheese bagel and a cinnamon raisin bagel, as a replacement for the everything. Not even fifteen seconds later, a girl walks out from the back with a pan of everything bagels. I immediately ask for them to switch the cinnamon bagel out for an everything since I was just told they were out, and Sean looks at me and says in a loud voice with the rudest attitude he could muster, "I didn't SEE them behind the sesame bagels, okay?!" I was very taken aback. He then asks if my bagels are to go and I say yes. To lighten the mood, I then said "come on, do you really think I could eat two bagels? Ha ha" and without smiling he looks me up and down with his eyes lingering on my stomach, and says "I don't know." Implying that I look like I do!! I was so insulted by this. Everyone who works there looks so miserable, there are no smiles or "hi, how are you today?" The girl at the register snapped at a mom ahead of me, who looked shocked. I looked on Yelp and saw all the negative reviews. I ended up calling the manager about ten minutes later to tell him how awful my experience was, in case he is unaware of how terrible his workers are. His reply was "...okay? I will pull Sean aside and talk to him..." But he really didn't seem to care. I will not be back, I will drive a little farther for an Einstein bagel, served with a smile.

I can't attest to the actual ring-buying, but my fiance raves about this place! He said he went to Kay, Jared's, and a few others and he was getting discouraged so he decided to make the drive out to Shane Co. Apparently the other jewelry stores were dingy and overpriced in his opinion, and Shane Co far exceeded his hopes! He ended up designing my GORGEOUS ring, with a little help from the staff here! It's a cushion-cut halo, with a twisty diamond crusted band and they managed to keep it just under his budget! (Not sure what the budget was, but I guarantee it was the best bang for the buck) I still catch myself staring at my ring daily, and I have gotten it cleaned regularly since he slipped it on my finger, because I love the sparkle! The night he went to Shane Co., he told me that he had to work late (great cover) and I actually headed over to his work to surprise him with dinner. Thankfully I mentioned where I was headed to my friend (who knew what he was actually up to) and she called him to warn him, so they could stop be from blowing the surprise and showing up at his work (where he wasn't at)! We still laugh about that close-call. So glad he went here, and I'm even more glad my fiance had the opportunity to design my ring! It means so much more to me. Every time we have gone in, everyone has been so warm and accommodating! Way to go, Shane Co!

My best friend got married here, and I loved the venue, but she warned me about Patrick. As soon as I got engaged, this was the first venue my fiance and I went to look at. The grounds are great, and the setup is really beautiful. We went to the open house, and Patrick's dad directed us to him. He was in mid conversation with another bride as we walked semi-close to him, and then he stopped the conversation he was already engaged in, to greet us and ask if we had questions. It was kind of awkward. The other bride looked offended at the interruption, rightfully so, so I told him we were happy to wait. He dismisses them a few minutes later (literally they told him they were ready to sign a contract for their date, and he said "okay go inside and I will catch up with you when I can.") They slowly walked away, clearly a little disappointed he wasn't making them a priority. Again, awkward.   This was when it got frustrating. My fiance and I asked him about a Saturday morning wedding, and he said AND I QUOTE, "yeah we could do that, but if other brides come in to set up their wedding during your ceremony or reception, there is nothing I can do. Be prepared for some visitors looking to set up early. We will be pushing you out at 12pm." I was so shocked, if I am PAYING from 8am to 12pm or 1pm, I expect that I will have that time for the best day of my life, and not have to worry about other brides trying to interrupt to set up their evening wedding!!!  Also, I did not appreciate how unprofessional it was that he told me they would be pushing us out, when we paid for that time. I felt like he was trying to squeeze me in to make some quick money, but he made me feel like my wedding wouldn't be a priority because it was morning and they have other, night weddings to worry about. And I also didn't like that he straight up told me that he would allow other brides to interrupt MY wedding to set up their wedding, hours later! Overall, very unpleasant. I went with Château De Vie in Chandler, and am so pleased I did. I would not recommend this venue, as long as Patrick is running it.

I hate this credit Union. I have had an account with them for sixteen years, since my parents opened a junior account for me on my eighth birthday. Throughout the years, they have always given me poor customer service and they always talk down to me, as if I don't understand banking lingo simply because I am a girl in her late teens through early twenties. Very frustrating, since I have held three federal jobs with direct deposit, and had multiple lines of credit with them, and they still treat me as if I my very presence is an inconvenience. And the people I speak to on the phone or in person, never have enough knowledge about things, yet act as if they do. When I was eighteen I tried to open credit with them, and they told me it would boost my credit but I had to have a cosigner. I got to cosigner, and they told me next time I would be able to get credit without the cosigner. Yippee! I paid the three year loan off in nine months, and a few months ago I decided I needed a new car. I went to this credit union to get the loan, and they told me I still didn't have enough credit and need another cosigner!! Please note, I have four lines of credit through other banks and the government, so its not that I'm not established, and my credit score is average. So began the beginning of my mistrust of this place   This last week, I finally had enough. I accidentally overdrafted, for the first time since I was in high school! I was starting a new job, and accidentally ran the wrong debit card all day, out of habit. I went into this credit union to set up direct deposit for the new job, and the teller told me I had three overdraft fees. Oh no! But she told me that I was in luck because they have forgiveness for three overdrafts a year. Woohoo! She calls up Lynn, one of the managers who has always given my parents and I, poor customer service especially through the credit fiasco. She immediately recognized me, and without even looking at the screen, asks the teller which account I have. Lynn then looks at me, and says "yeah we can't reverse them. They weren't our fault, they were your fault." And she said it SO RUDELY, as if she was talking to a three year old. At first I thought she was joking, because of how flippant she was about it and she was smiling gleefully as she said it. Apparently making me unhappy brings her joy, which wouldn't surprise me due to how impolite she always is. After I realized she was serious, I was irritated. So I force a smile, and say "the teller just told me I get three a year." And Lynn once again says, "we only reverse charges that are our fault. But we didn't run the card, YOU did." Again, SO RUDE AND CONDESCENDING. I was livid. But I bit my tongue, and smiled and said thank you, and then she smiled back and then hovered over the tellers shoulder, as if to ensure that those charges were not reversed. It was really awkward. I would have understood if she had said no we can't in a polite or friendly way (since the charges WERE my fault) but she was so rude and the conflicting information was very frustrating.  I ended up calling the call center, and someone higher up did end up reversing the charges, by upgrading my account. Not sure why Lynn didn't suggest that while she was standing there, but I will assume it is because she feeds off the unhappiness of members.  Wednesday is my 24th birthday, and to celebrate, I am closing the account. As a recommendation to the higher ups, train your employees so they are all on the same page, and make sure that the people you promote aren't rude. My parents have banked with FCU for much longer than I have, and when I told them how rude Lynn was to me, they mentioned they might close their account too. Chase offers the same accounts and credit, but have much better customer service. And at the end of the day, I will happily pay a little higher interest, to a company that treats me well.

I have gone here a thousand times, and always enjoy it. This was the first place my (now) fiancé and I ever met up at, and it was where we first discussed our future together. The night he proposed, we reenacted our first time meeting here (looking back, I should have seen it coming) and he proposed right down the street, at the little bench in front of the lake down Islands. I have the best memories thanks to this Starbucks, and I am so glad it exists. Also the partners are really nice, and the drinks are always great. My fiance and I still come here regularly, and it just moved buildings so the parking is hopefully better!

I come here one to two times a week with my boyfriend on his lunch break. They always have fast service and delicious food. The "lighter fare" of rosemary chicken and potatoes always makes me happy. Never tried anything else except a few bites of my boyfriends choice hamburger. The latest one he has liked has cream cheese and jalapeños I think? Very good, but so spicy that it burned my mouth. Yum! I enjoy this place immensely.

Love this place. Went on a really awful date here, but the food made the whole experience worth it! Mac and cheese, corn, beans, pulled pork, it's all incredible.

Yesterday an older woman employee (possibly a manager?) was outright yelling and cursing at a teenage employee. It was very unprofessional and just plain embarrassing. A few other people in line were clearly uncomfortable, and I considered saying something but she was so aggressive, I was afraid she would yell at me. I will not be back. I felt so bad for the teenage boy, he was very polite and friendly as he rang me up, even as the older lady was telling him to shut up and being rude.

The little brunette teller was wonderful, I absolutely adored her, otherwise I would give a one star. I asked to change my pin and the manager lady said it would be a few minutes. THIRTY FIVE MINUTES later after being told this six times, I finally ask the same manager what is going on. She ends up telling me their machine is down, and has been all day and she recommends I go to a different Chase... Wish she would have told me that immediately instead of putting it off for almost forty minutes.

They were the only place that could replace my one plus cell phone screen. It cost me 150 bucks, but it was still cheaper than a new phone so I went for it. They quoted me an hour but when I came to pick it up, they said it would be another hour. I was a little frustrated to wait, though the guy did apologize. Also, the guys aren't very friendly, and remind me of Vulcan's.

My favorite restaurant hands down. I go here two to three times a month, for their Monday Tuesday deal. The bruschetta is incredible, at first I was weary of the pairings but I have never been disappointed. I came here on a first date with a very picky eater, now we have been dating for 6 months and it's our go to place since we both love it. The Moscato is perfect, and I always make my boyfriend drive so I can guzzle it down. My only qualm is the fact that servers are not assigned sections, so there has been a time or two and I have been forgotten for over 20 minutes while they attended to someone else, thinking I had already been helped. Overall the atmosphere, staff, food, and wine all make this a wonderful experience. I highly recommend for anyone and everyone. Even my mom loves it, and she is the least adventurous eater ever. Plus they have gluten free options for her!

I went to the Ahwatukee location first, and they did not impress me. I decided to try out the Scottsdale location for bridesmaid dresses, and Nicolette(?) was our attendant. She was incredible!!! I ended up making another appointment for my wedding dress with her, just because of how great she was. As a side note, I would definitely recommend NOT using Google maps to get there, because it took us on a huge, unnecessary detour which resulted in us being twenty five minutes late to the appointment, and apparently that happens to a lot of people. Thankfully, Nicolette was very sweet and although the appointment was only supposed to be the remainder of the hour (leaving us with 35 minutes) she got me in and out of nine dresses, and allowed us to go a little over on time. A few of the other attendants came around to watch me try on the top two contenders, and they helped "jack me up" with a veil and "Sash-a Fierce" let me try on a belt. I didn't get the belt (sorry Sasha!) but the girls were all so sweet and funny. I was laughing the whole time, because they were so hilarious and bantered really well. Overall, it was a fantastic experience and I got my dream dress, under budget! Also, Nicolette deserves a raise because she was so awesome, and has a lot of patience with demanding brides. The bride before me seemed to think this shop was a great place for a family reunion, and brought like thirty members of her family to watch her try on dresses, and Nicolette handled it like a champ. Okay, I will stop gushing over how great she is, but she really, really is! I wish I had caught the names of all the other girls too, but I know one was the manager and she was wonderful too! Thanks for helping my dreams come true, ladies! :)

I got my hair done with Kylie and she is fantastic! I had to book three weeks in advance, but it was worth the wait. She took the time to really get it right, even though it took over an hour longer than she had planned. The color was amazing, the curl was awesome and she was FAST. My hair has taken over eight hours to cut and color with people less experienced, and she had me cut, colored (a few different colors!), washed, dried and styled in three hours. And I have a TON of hair. Plus she explained what she was doing, and why. It really added to the experience. I usually dread the small talk awkwardness with my stylists, and she was so fun I was laughing the entire time! Plus she let me do homework while my color sat, and she just sat there in silence and left me in peace. It was awesome. Totally recommend her, and her amazing skills! If I had time to make the drive, I would have her style my hair weekly!

Wait was 45 minutes for a table, so my friends and I sat at the bar. Great pizza and bruschetta! Plus the bartender was very friendly and fun. She answered all our questions and even had the bruschetta cut into thirds instead of halves, so each of us could sample them. :)

I ordered an acai bowl... There was literally no one else in the entire building, yet it took eighteen minutes for it to be put on the counter, without even an apology or acknowledgement for the amount of time that had passed. An older man who I assumed was the owner was quite pretentious when I ordered, and he seemed a little too invested in the conversation with his much younger female employee. Both of them seemed annoyed when I asked for a to go cup, as if I was interrupting their conversation. The acai bowl was awesome, but I couldn't believe the wait time for it. The customer service (or lack of) definitely detracted from the whole experience.
