Disappointed in the service we received this weekend. We were seated for 20 minutes and, despite flagging down the bus boy, could even get a glass of water. The server finally acknowledged us but didn't return for our drink order for another 10 minutes. I'm deeply disappointed and won't go back any time soon.

This pizzeria is quickly becoming one of our favorites. The deep dish, Chicago style, pizza is to die for! It is perfectly balanced with delicious cheese that isn't over powering and blends well with the other ingredients. The bottom crust is deliciously crunchy - so good, addictive actually. We always receive great service. Nate is one of the best servers we have ever met. He is attentive, makes great recommendations and follows our pace. I highly recommend this restaurant

I am forever grateful to this hospital and their nurses and physicians. I went there when I couldn't breathe, my arms and legs were also numb. The intake specialist immediately noticed how sick I was when I walked in, waved me to the front of the line and called for a wheelchair and oxygen. She quickly got basic information from me but her main focus was to get help for me. They wheeled me back and had a doctor see me immediately. They started an IV and ordered tests to quickly diagnose my illness. We knew within 30 minutes that I had pneumonia and a blood clot. Once they knew what was wrong then they sent a person to my bedside to gather my personal and insurance information. I spent 4 days there and they took great care of me. The doctors, nurses, therapists, lab techs, even the person from food serve was friendly, compassionate, and helpful.

Deeply disappointed with this practice and medical advice. I had double pneumonia for 2 months that they didn't diagnose. Instead they told me I had allergies and persuaded me to buy allergy drops for $350 out of pocket; I was desperate and couldn't breathe so I trusted their medical expertise. I still did not get better so I went back and was told I had probably developed asthma from my allergies, they prescribed an inhaler. One week later I still couldn't breathe so I went to the emergency room where they discovered the pneumonia and a blood clot in my lung. I truly believe that their main goal is to make money at all costs, health care is secondary. I will find a new primary care physician

We had quite the dinner experience at this restaurant on Christmas Eve... I think the limited employees who were working on this night lost a bet and were required to be there that night -and if they were miserable they were going to make sure EVERYONE was miserable. They yelled at each other from across the room. They argued about who would seat us and begrudgingly found a table for us. The waitress practically threw the silverware at us when we asked for it. It took over 30 minutes for our food to be served. We ordered prime rib and it was served cold. My husband and I still laugh at the absurdity of the whole situation.  We will never go to this restaurant again

We regularly visit this restaurant because of the friendly service, tasty food and excellent happy hour food options. We love the cheesy and buttery Shrimp Cargo appetizer that is served with toasted bread. The Chicken Club Salad is my favorite main course. It comes with one of their warm, soft and delicious croissants.

The Balsamic salad was delicious but it is huge - enough for 2. I also had the tasty tomato basil soup but the best part of my meal was the Chipotle Bloody Mary - it was tasty with just enough spice and was served with 3 large green olives. Highly recommend!

This place is fine dining at its best. Attentive service and delicious food. This hidden gem located inside the Golden Nugget was a refreshing change in decor, ambiance, and service. Both the veal and filet were cooked to perfection and practically melted in your mouth. I loved the au gratin potatoes - I would come back for the potatoes alone. The strawberry basil martini was a little strong but I enjoyed the flavor. I would highly recommend this classic steakhouse.

We called an order in for take out. I was asked to hold while the in-store customers were handled. The food was cold and sloppy. The buns were soggy from the condiments and assembled half heartedly. We were disappointed

I loved the casual feel of this restaurant. They have a comfortable patio area for outside dining. The service was prompt and attentive. I ordered the Brown Bag Chicken Sandwich and it was excellent! I also ordered the Church Potatoes - they were amazing! Great comfort food - highly recommend!

The custom made pizza is amazing! Great sauce and toppings options all included in the price of the pizza, they don't charge extra for each topping. I also love their Watermelon tea. My family loves this place - we eat here often! Good food and good prices!

I love this delightful shellfish shack; it has a casual and fun feel to it.  Come prepared to get messy - they lay down butcher paper on the table to soak spillage (and there is a lot of spillage).  I appreciate the simple concept of selecting your shellfish, sauce, spice and additions.  The #2 - Sizzlin was pretty hot.  I ordered the Trifecta sauce (garlic, lemon, and Cajun) and it was tasty but too hot for me.  I ordered the mild = wimpy on the second visit.  They serve the shellfish in a plastic bag that is plopped down on your table and you go crazy pulling out the meat.  It is fun but messy - wear the bib. Butter is not served with the lobster or crab, you have to request it as an add on.  The restaurant is crazy busy so expect a wait of at least an hour on the weekends.  The prices are reasonable for shellfish and the servers were attentive and friendly.

I love this trendy restaurant! They serve authentic Mexican food - zesty dishes that use the perfect Mexican spice blend. The Tortilla soup is a must have! The carnitas tacos were served with a green salsa, avocado and cilantro were tasty - you get a free side if you order 3 tacos. We also had the Mexican Sweet Corn as an appetizer - so good! The servers were friendly and attentive.

Heavenly! The Cajun Lobster Roll I ordered was served on a warm, toasty, buttery Texas Toast bread that was shaped like a hit dog bun. It was overflowing with sweet lobster chunks and seasoned with a Cajun spice that was made from a unique blend of herbs that offered just the right amount of flavor but wasn't too spicy and didn't overpower the natural lobster flavor. The roll was served with homemade chips that were crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside - delicious. The service was great! I can't wait to go back.

Chandler store:  We were more than impressed with both the food and service! I called with a take out order on their Family and Friends training day (I thought they were already open); their grand opening is tomorrow. The manager was exceptionally professional and friendly, he took my order and then informed me about their training day and graciously agreed to fill our order even though they weren't officially open - it was such a welcoming conversation. And the food! It was amazing! The chicken tender breading was crazy good. The bacon cheesy sliders were delicious, they taste like steak and are cooked to perfection. Portion sizes are pretty huge, you can easily share. We would highly recommend this new burger joint!
