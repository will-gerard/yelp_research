This place is an icon. Lil has been here for years. We like to have a PBR and listen to some music and just relax in this great little neighborhood bar.

This place takes such care in their food preparation... Their entrees are always top notch. This place is much more upscale in their food and prices, but I think is well worth it for the ambiance and the food that they serve.. We shared an appetizer and an entree and it was plenty of food. We live right down the street, so I would love to see this place continue to do well. It has great servers and was a great experience...

I really hate to do this, because there are so many great reviews, but I did not have a good experience and I feel it is important to share. I called last week and asked to schedule an appointment for them to come and take a look at the unit on my new house. The man I spoke with, said he thought he could come the next day and would call me back and never did. Later in the week, I received a call, and I was told that they just realized that were supposed to come and that I could have any time that I wanted. I rescheduled for today at 10:30 and no one ever showed up. I did call and leave a message. At this point, I'm moving on to another company. I actually feel mostly disappointed, because it seems to me they have done great things for other people.

We were looking for a good place to have fish and chips and I found this place on Yelp. I agree with the other reviewers that say this place is very good. It is a simple place in a strip center and I probably wouldn't have just stopped by, had I not read the reviews. We had the spicy catfish and the cod. I had the okra which is one of my favorite things in the world and it was very good. It was not greasy and everything was freshly made. We were greeted with a smile and made to feel very welcome. We definitley will be back.

This place has the best happy hour. $1 street tacos, $5 skinny margaritas, and $2 chips and salsa. Also, during regular hours the margaritas are all fresh squeezed lime juice, great tequila, and fresh ingredients. The owner Obed takes great pride in his new place. I'm excited to have a new place within walking distance to our our house.

What can I add to the other reviews. This place is such a friendly neighborhood space. Great beer selections, wine and games to play with friends. We have known Emily (one of the bartenders) from Sun Up for a long time. It just feels so fun to have a place to go near by and enjoy good company, beer and have a great time!!
