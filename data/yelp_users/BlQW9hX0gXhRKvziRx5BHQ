The nail technician I had was very sweet but the front desk person was rude. I came in with a group of 6 people for a bridal appointment and the bride had some issues with her dress to deal with and we were 10 mins late. First they called the bride 1 minute after we were supposed to be there (ONE MINUTE) and when we arrived the front desk person made a huge deal about it and had to ask the manager if we could still get our nails done. I don't think I will ever visit this nail salon again.

This bridal boutique was great!!! Our bridal consultant Jessica  was so sweet and helpful.  Their dress selection was amazing and the prices were reasonable. I highly recommend finding your dream dress here.

I came in before 11 and they weren't open yet but instead of turning me away they encouraged me to come in and order. They have amazing customer service and are very accommodating.

Kim is so sweet and my nails turned out exactly how I wanted. They have a ton of options for gel colors and everything is very clean.
