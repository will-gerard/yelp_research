I have am on my third lease. I remember looking to rent here with an ex boyfriend and this was our dream place. I ended up later moving into a one bedroom by myself. I love the complex. Its quiet, clean, and safe. Though my friend left her car one night and it got broken in to because she has a radar detector in her window. Kinda a freak incident. Other then the stoners that live above and over from me I have no issues. I can hear occasionally the people above me walking but its normal for apt living. I recommend this complex to my friends.

I drove by this place last night and the lights and atmosphere drew me in. Ended up going there the next day. Me and my friend ordered the calamari and it was straight out of a Kroger box. No tentacles or rings. Just thick pieces of god knows what. I know we live far from an ocean but you can find decent fish on this state. The salad was fine as it is hard to mess up. I ordered the chicken swarama or whatever it was called and it was not impressive. The chicken was dry but I took the leftovers home so I could at least make use of the pita bread. I was disappointed because the outside was super intriguing. The best part of the experience was my best friend and the pitcher of blue moon. The bar area was packed so stick to a liquid diet here. Even our server seemed few and far between checking on us due to lack of confidence in what she was serving. I think this place has potential but maybe as a bar with no food.

I was more then impressed with Massage Envy. I have been having ridiculous lower back/hip pain for a year now and after physical therapy not cutting it i wanted to try a massage. I was welcomed the moment i walked in the door by Jacob. He went over the paperwork and my concerns and explained to me how they work. I then waited in the relaxation area which did exactly that. The music and lighting was calming. Then i was greeted by Amber. She was absolutely amazing. I had a 90min deep tissue massage with her. Afterwords she met me outside with water and went over what she found. In all reality I am a mess. I figured i was bad but not this bad. I have already booked my next massage with her and walked out pain free today.

Love this place. It has become a place I go with my girlfriends regularly. They have so many beers on tap and even cider. This is great because I have a friend who has a gluten allergy so she can get her cider fix. The food as well is awesome. From the apps to the entrees you cannot go wrong. The bartenders and servers are prompt and friendly.

I love this place. My new morning coffee shop. I love that they offer almond milk as I am lactose intolerant and all the drinks I have tried are amazing. I now buy the punch card so I get a free drink. I recommended it to my friend since they opened in north scottsdale by her apartment.
