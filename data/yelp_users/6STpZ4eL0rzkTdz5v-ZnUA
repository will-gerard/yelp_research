Wendy is like a second mom to me. In fact, my own mother and I have been going to Wendy's for the past 15 years. Yes, 15 years. Regulars are treated like royalty. Sorry, that's NOT A BAD BUSINESS PRACTICE AT ALL. Reward the people who keep coming back by being extra nice, that's called a GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICE.  Now, understandably, you know exactly what you're walking into when you come into nail shops like these. People have absolutely ridiculous standards for what they're paying for at Wendy's. If you want to be bitchy and demanding, yeah, they're probably going to talk shit about you. Guess what, the same thing happens when you go to restaurants and act like a princess.   I ALWAYS get a pedicure, usually with Jason or Ann depending on the day I go. If it's busy, they will go quickly but not do a bad job. And if you're unhappy or notice they messed up before you leave the salon, it's on YOU as a customer to say something first before going on Yelp to complain about it afterwards when you didn't sat a word.    Wendy doesn't have the most warming demeanor but she's a hard-working woman and literally the epitome of the American Dream.

Horrible horrible service.  Came around noon on a thursday and there were 2 tables seated besides my table. The busser brought our waters and iced tea fairly quickly and then ten minutes later our server finally came to take our order.  So, we ordered a greek salad which came out pretty quickly and then we noticed that the two other tables got their pizzas right after we finished our salad. So another twenty minutes goes by and still no pizzas, finally after a half an hour our server came over and said there was a computer malfunction and that our pizzas would be there in the next ten minutes. Needless to say, the pizza was good which is why I gave it two stars. Other than that, I will probably never come back.

Great beer selection, especially if you're into Four Peaks brews.  I had the Pesto pizza and added garlic. It was absolutely delicious.   The only thing that was bothersome was we were sitting at the Pizza bar which happens to be next to where the food comes out of the kitchen and some guy that worked there kept complaining to the cooks/pizza makers about the food. It's like, if you don't like it so much why don't you get behind the counter and make it yourself?  So besides the whiney man and semi-attentive server the food is absolutely delicious and the atmosphere is great.  I would definitely recommend The Parlor to anyone who likes awesome gourmet pizza.

It makes me so sad to say this but I have given up on you Juliobertos.  I ordered my last bean and cheese burrito from there yesterday and was SHOCKED when I found what resembled to be a PUBIC HAIR in the spillage coming out of the bottom of my burrito.  So disgusting, I am never going back. I used to eat there ALL THE TIME too. Makes me shiver to think what else I could've eaten there before.

Wow. Two stars because the food is always delicious but what the hell has happened to the service?  I wasn't even going to write this review because I asked for the manager (Aaron, great guy) and his empathy blew my mind.   1. My two male friends arrived at 7:30 on Thursday night and asked the host for a table for 4, she seated them outside on the patio and said "your server will be right with you."  2. My bf and I arrive 5 minutes later and walk into the restaurant hoping the host would be there to take us to our friends. Truth be told, the only person in a mellow t-shirt that was visible was the bartender. Mildly disappointing but we spotted our friends on the patio and decided to seat ourselves.  3. We get outside at 7:37 pm. We sit down, look at the menu and I ask if anyone has come by yet because I'm super thirsty. Turns out the answer is no but there are two different servers bringing the other tables food, drinks and service.  4. Around 7:45 the server helping the adjacent table looks over at the four of us so we're hopeful that she's either going to come over and say "hey I'm your server" or "I'm sorry you've been sitting there for 15 minutes, let me see what happened with YOUR server" but no, nothing. I've had several jobs in the service industry, many of them while I was an overstrained bitch in college, but I never let a table sit with menus in front of them with no drinks for more than 10 minutes, even if the table wasn't mine. I must've been silly for wanting to make sure the place I worked made money from happy customers, not from customers  who's bill you almost had to comp because your incapable staff screwed up repeatedly, without remorse to add. (shout out to Aaron the manager again, you give me hope for the service industry, unlike the people you work with)  5. At this point, I'm slightly irritated but willing to go find the hostess to see if we can get her to grab our server.  6. It's now 7:52, I checked my phone while waiting for the blonde hostess to get back to her hostess stand. 7:54, she sees me and one other couple waiting and slowly (seriously, i've seen people on ketamine move faster) walks back to her stand and addresses the couple first (not a huge deal).  7. 7:55: Blondie is back but has no idea what I'm talking about, "what table are you talking about? Who?" me-"my two male friends sitting outside that YOU seated twenty-five minutes ago and my boyfriend, dude in the hat facing the street." her-"can you like point it out to me, I'm not sure who you're talking about" mind you, the patio and my table are completely visible, due to the GIANT WINDOWS. I digress...  8. I get her to follow me outside, where I point to our table and make sure she sees who I'm talking about. "oh, you got here 25 minutes ago? I'll send someone over"  9. 8:02, a male server, who I haven't seen at all, comes out and says something along the lines of, "I'm sorry guys (please, I'm not a guy, learn some manners) you've been waiting here for too long, blah blah blah something about miscommunication, what can I get you to drink?" My friend is pissed because the last time we went to Mellow, they screwed up his order and our other friends order as well and he doesn't understand why we keep coming back. He orders water because he refuses to give them any sort of business. At this point, I get it. The server then asks if we're ready to order food, really? We've been sitting here for 30 minutes staring at the menu, yes, we're ready.   10. We order the Tye Dye pizza, sans tomato & cucumber with a half order of salt & butter pretzels (hoping those come before the meal as we're starving and thirsty). My friend orders a small Tye Dye, sans mozzarella with vegan cheese added.   11. Our drinks come out a few minutes after that, probably around 8:10 at this point. Our pizzas follow, about 15 minutes after that so, 8:25.   12. Since our friend is only drinking water, we feel bad and eat quickly. Did I mention the pretzels haven't come out yet?  13. We've finished our pizza, the pretzels come out at 8:40, we get our servers attention and ask for a to-go box for the pretzels and pizza, and the check.  14. At this point, since they screwed up pretty badly, I'm expecting that someone has the decency to knock off maybe my beer (our bill was 58 total, before I spoke to Aaron) but no, everything is on there, including the pretzels. The pretzels that came after we were done eating.  15. I look at the check and ask to speak to manager immediately. About 5 minutes later, Aaron walks out, looking pretty upset and distressed (we've all been there).  16. I preface everything with the fact that I've been coming to Mellow for a long time, my love for their pizza started in North Carolina a few years ago and I'm going to keep coming back. He's extremely sympathetic and thanks me for being patient. We get $10 knocked off our bill and two $5 coupons in hopes that we will return. I will, but probably only for take out. Damn.

I went into Bianco on Saturday night with 2 friends. First of all, the waitress (named Maria) was not helpful at all. We asked her for wine recommendations and she recommended the most expensive bottles on the list, sorry but no. Then, when it came time to pay the waitress overcharged us (she rang in beer instead of espresso, really?) and then when we got the corrected bill, we all paid and went home. The next morning, I looked at my bank statement and realized I was over charged by THIRTY DOLLARS. I immediately went into the restaurant and the manager said he would void the charge and charge us the correct amount. Well, the sneaky guy decided to charge me $64.10 instead of $58.10. Even WITH the correct receipt he still managed to over charge me. What a f-ing joke. Learn some goddamn customer service.   I will NEVER go to Bianco ever again.
