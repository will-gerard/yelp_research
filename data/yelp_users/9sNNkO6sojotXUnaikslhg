In a world of Starbucks, this is a rare gem.  The espresso beans are awesome & they will sell you some to take home.  I don't really go for flavored beans, but they have those too.  They have a big selection of baked goods and the scones are buttery and amazing.  They have a great selection of teas & brew every cup fresh.  The pomegranate green tea is awesome. I love that they still have punch cards to get your 10th drink free (any way you want it).

This dry cleaner is close to my house, so I gave it a try and have gone back 2 times.  I haven't had any problem with the actual cleaning, which is why I gave them two stars instead of one.  The problem is that they can never seem to clean my clothes fast.  The first time they told me that same day cleaning wasn't available because their pickup came earlier than expected that day (not that I missed the normal cutoff time).  The second time, I didn't need same day, but they couldn't even do next day service.  I was told that they have 5 stores, and people procrastinated all their dropoffs until the beginning of the week. Isn't that what people always do? Shouldn't the fact that you have 5 stores mean you can figure out a way to actually get all your dry cleaning needs met? If I was putting up with slow service because the dry cleaning was cheap, that would be one thing, but this place is not a bargain by any stretch. I think I'll try over paying at the Organic Dry Cleaners across the street.

I've picked up a gyro from here before and couldn't really remember if I had liked it, so I stopped to grab something quick on my way back to work. I've read some reviews that say their falafel is good, which I can't speak to. I can say that the gyro, the side greek salad that came with it and the baklawa were overpriced and disgusting. The shredded iceberg that topped the gyro and comprised most of the salad was browing and reminded me of what subway would have thrown out .The baklawa was soggy. This might explain why they were completely empty and able to serve me quickly right around noon on a week day. I'd say the Schlotsky's two doors down would be a better and cheaper options. If I really want a gyro, I'll go the mall food court and get a cheaper gyro that actually tastes good from Pita Jungle.

Love it!!! I lived within blocks of this restaurant for over a year before I tried it, which was my mistake.  My friends and I have a theory that they drug their food because it is so addictive.  Their Green Curry is heavenly and I go back & forth between getting it with Chicken or Tofu.  The Thai Basil is good too.  Try the spring rolls. The take out portions are not skimpy, and the veggies are always fresh & perfectly cooked. This restaurant is one of my favorites.

The Wor Wonton Soup comes in a big container and has a flavorful broth, crisp veggies, lots of wontons and meat.  It is great with chili sauce in it.  I've heard the Peking Duck is great, but have yet to try it.

A hip restaurant in an old house downtown (next to Cibo). The menu is somewhat snooty, but I've been very pleased with the breakfast items I've tried. There is usually a wait, but there is lots of outdoor seating and tables to wait at.  The cranberry nut bread is delish. They seem to be bike and dog friendly (outside only of course). The service is ok and they really should figure out how to not keep people waiting when they have open tables, but overall this is great place.  They have a website, so you can check out their menu before you go.

Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. They have a great selection of slices  until 4pm. The white pizza with a side salad (tip, ask to add mozzarella) was amazing. They made us a fresh order of garlic knots despite having a plethora on display. The sandwiches come on amazing soft, yet flaky bread. I dipped everything in a big bowl of marinara and was in heaven. The staff was super friendly.   Definitely not a first date place, but the best NY style pizza I've found in AZ. I'm a little bummed I've driven by so many times. We'll definitely be getting takeout and delivery regularly.  They'll also sell their dough to take home. I'm in love with this place.

I should probably eat here a few more times before giving it a full 5 stars, but 4 stars wouldn't express my enthusiasm enough.  Their sangria is awesome. Their servers have all been amazing. The biscuits and gravy are spectacular, and the hangover sandwich is filling but also amazing. I haven't tried the lunch menu, so I'll be back.  The hostess wasn't the most helpful with trying to get a group of 5 on the patio, but it was probably due to my own uncertainty of where we wanted to sit. Give this place a try for hanging out on the patio or for a good breakfast spot in Old Town.

Pita Jungle has something for everything. Even my pickiest friends love it.  The Desert Ridge location is brand new, has a big patio, more tables than the other locations and the food quality has not suffered.  The Salmon Salad, Pesto Pizza, Jalapeno Cilantro Hummus & the Beef Gyro are among my favorite items. This location does feel less hipster than the Tempe location, but that isn't a bad thing.

To call it a kennel would be blasphemy.  This is a cage free pet hotel with web cams and friendly/consistent staff.  While it is a bit more expensive to board your dog here, its not that much more than the kennels that keep your dog in a cage & charge you extra to give your animal attention or a treat.  Your dog must be interviewed to make sure he gets along with the other animals. If your dog is social and doesn't like to be ignored the entire time you are on vacation, Villa La Paws is a must. Don't let the strip mall location deter you. They also offer pet daycare, so there are always lots of dogs that join in on the playtime.  They offer some discounts & packages to help with the pricing.  I always have my dog groomed right before I pick him up. I get my dog back clean, tired & happy to see me.

My 5 stars is a bit generous because the ambiance of this restaurant isn't really what I look for in a restaurant, BUT sometimes you need to break the rules to get your point across.  As a long-time fan of Fate, I should have given Sens a chance. It never really peaked my interest because the things I loved about Fate didn't seem to match the new tapas menu. Now Chef Johnny has recreated his craft again and brought it all together in Sochu House. It's not as charming as Fate was, but he has some items on his menu that make me want to hug him. If you don't like strip malls, or hip decor or loud DJs, try the items below and perhaps you will forgive all the things about Sochu House that I've gotten over:  HOT N SOUR SOUP (This is not the goopy brown stuff you get at a Chinese restaurant) - It's the most amazing spicy, tangy, tamarind broth ever. The little round rice noodles will change your life, and the copious amounts of fresh crisp veggies are amazing. SOUP GYOZA - unique and awesome BLACK DRAGON ENTREE - sometimes I ask for different veggies, but the sauce on this entree is beyond amazing. I get it with Chicken or the fried tofu. Mmmm. HOUSE DYNAMITE or the SPICY BASIL are also awesome entree choices.  For anyone who was sad when Fate closed, you can still get your fix of amazing asian fusion in Phoenix.
