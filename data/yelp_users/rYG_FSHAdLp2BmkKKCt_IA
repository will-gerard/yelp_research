I love Pane Bianco. Their Mozzarella tomato sandwich is simply delicious. Their bread taste so good which makes the sandwich well worth it.  I've been here several times and not one time have I been even remotely disappointed.

People in the hood need to learn how to follow directions. I made an online order and the driver read me what I ordered and looked at what I didn't order.

No reviews? It's probably because it's in South Phoenix and it's a small hole in the wall.   They have the best cerviche (Sinaloa style) ever. Oh and you might need to know Spanish to order but it's well worth it.

I came here during restaurant week and I ordered a bacon wrapped filet mignon with shrimp and scallops. Came with an appetizer of  buttered shrimp and a dessert (I ordered crème brulée but they didn't have it so I picked carrot cake).   The buttered shrimp appetizer was pretty good. The filet mignon was the best. I always get it medium rare and it always hits the spot. The shrimp and scallops were a bonus.  They didn't have the dessert I wanted but the Carrot cake (à la mode) was a big slice (like 1/4 of a regular carrot cake). I'm sure I would've gotten diabetes if I ate all of it but I took a few bites and finished the ice cream.  The price was pretty good, all of that was $39. In my opinion this is a little bit better than Mortons.

Chicken + Waffles = food coma.  I ordered the Lo Los which is 2 waffles and 3 pieces of fried chicken. It's really unhealthy but this is some good comfort food. The fried chicken here is the best fried chicken I've ever tasted. The waffles are good and everything wasn't that greasy and I skipped the butter. Those SNL guys should have said "Fried Chicken + waffles = crazy delicious."   I did order the mac and cheese but to me it's the same everywhere else. I must say it should be recommend you burn 5000 calories before and after going.

I've had an account for them for years and in the last few months my bill has increased by $100 for no real reason.  And one garbage can was "too full" so I had to pay an additional $60.00.

Ice cream was good and places like this is hard to find. Usually places just serve plain ice cream but this ice cream was really good.   I'd recommend this to everyone although it's a bit pricey for Ice Cream.

My friend and I split a Po Boy, BBQ chicken sandwich and some crab puffs. I'm not a vegan but I decided it was time for something healthy. i liked the Po Boy it was quite spicy. It was almost as good as the vegan Po Boy at wholefoods. The crab puffs tasted good but I like the regular stuff. I loved the BBQ chicken though it tasted almost like regular chicken and it was really tasty.  The fries were really tasty too. The only missing star is because the atmosphere to me different I'm not quite used to it but I highly recommend this place to others.

Why the negativity? These croissants are the best! Their croissant breakfast sandwich isn't bad either.

Lawry's has the best prime rib. First time in the Las Vegas location.   This place is so good their salad is amazing. The prime rib (Lawry's cut) is one of a kind along with a side of cream corn.   I always leave this place happy and this is one a few places that give you the feeling "the world feels right."

It's hard to find authentic Chinese food but this is close enough. Their seafood soup was good and the salt and pepper shrimp is awesome. Their beef chow fun is legit.   I'm not a fan of AZ Chinese food but it sure beats a 400 mile drive to California.

BRAISED KOBE SHORT RIBS were amazing! That was the best Kobe beef I have ever tried. I also ordered the Braised noodles with scallops and enoki mushrooms which was an interesting combination.  The customer service is awesome and they speak Cantonese!

I love Mexican Food and Chinese Food and who would've thought... together?   The place looks like a taco shop in the ghetto but who cares. The panda is wearing a sombrero and has a mustache and is holding a bowl of rice. The lady lets you sample some of the favorites which is unique because most restaurants you're stuck with guessing.   I ordered a jade chicken quesadilla and ginger chicken with rice and beans. The food is amazing and whoever thought of this idea is genius. They give you a cookie with their order but my friend ordered "snickerdoodle" because it sounds funny. It was a cinnamon cookie.    And their on the wall it says "The Great Wall of Chino." Someday I'll be on that wall :)

I like vintage games but stuff is really unorganized. On top of that employees don't help you or don't keep track of inventory. Their best answer is "if it's not in the pile it's not there."  I'd rather go to Bookmans or use eBay.

I ordered the Nachos which is just a huge try of fried wantons with cheese, pepperoni and some type of meat. That tasted interesting but it was a huge tray for $10.00.  My friends ordered a Sausage Pizza which had hot dog meat for sausage. The Chicken Alfredo tasted like the hot dogs which some weird cream.   For my waffle fries I was given cocktail sauce instead of ketchup... wtf.  i'm never going here again.

I love the atmosphere and this place is probably the only place in Downtown Phoenix that has class.  I love the drinks they serve here. I recommend the Pims cup and the spicy Bloody Mary.   The margherita pizza with pepperoni is also one of the best.

This is the best chili dog I've ever eaten in Phoenix. FYI it is inside an Antique Shop but it is definitely worth checking out.   And yes, Pittsburgh Willy is a hardcore Steelers fan and he has a bunch of Steelers swag.

I love foot massages they are always so relaxing and takes away all the stress. The people are nice here and it's a quite atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that is looking to relax. Foot Massages are a Chinese thing but you gotta try it I mean it feels so good after that and it makes you feel like your walking on air.

This place is a gem in South Phoenix. Their fish and chips are really good and I love their seasoning.   The Philly Cheese Steaks are amazing. They have a drive thru, in case your scared of the hood.

Delivery in South Phoenix is usually terrible even with big pizza chains. Pizza is usually the only thing that delivers too.   They have a wide range of food from burgers, wings, philly cheese steaks, and seafood. The wings are really good and the pastrami is amazing.   Every now and then they have fried oreos or other cool things to try.

It's a small Chinese Restaurant next to Bashas. I was out with some friends and we found a small restaurant. We ordered Walnut shrimp and egg foo young. The food was pretty good for its price and the staff was friendly. They even gave us free crab puffs.   They deliver which is cool because it's a good alternative than Pizza. It's a $20 minimum though.

This shooting range is close to my house and the staff is very friendly. The prices for the lanes are really good. I usually have eyes, ears, guns and ammo so I'm not sure about the rentals. They don't let you use shotguns unless you're a member.

I love paletas. I found this place through Yelp and loved what everyone said. I grew up in South Phoenix and I do remember the paleta carts rolling around. Since those aren't around I had to find an alternative.   I do recommend this place however for me $3 / paleta is quite high. They used to be $1.    FYI: It's cash only.

I had to book a flight to China on a short notice and they stayed up until 12am to finish and helped me obtain the proper visa. They have superior customer service and I would highly recommend using them.

I actually have been going here for a while now. The food was excellent. Though the past 3 times I have gone the food has declined rapidly. Super soggy noodles and still frozen crab puffs aren't my idea of a good meal.

Their bread is amazing! I found this at the Town and Country farmers market. This changes my view on what good bread is. I highly recommend this and get there early because they sell out fast.
