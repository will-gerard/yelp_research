Ok well first off we walked in with a party of two , there was a huge line an the server said it was a 45 minute wait so we asked to sit at the bar witch we did an on the way noticed the  restaurant was pretty much empty an the bar was full ! The bartender was great her name was Jennifer an she made excellent drinks ! On the other hand food was way to expensive an extremely way to spicy to the point I didn't eat ! Also there was no silverware an no napkins anywhere to be found :/ not to mention all of the servers stood around an talked to one another ! We will not be going back :(

Best Chinese take out I have ever had ! Very very pricey ! But absolutely worth it ! I have a few different things on there menu an all where great and good size portions ! The down sides are how pricey an that they charge 5 bucks extra for delivery and don't give that to there drivers also I wanted to substitute white rice for the fried rice and was willing to pay extra but they wouldn't budge at all on that !! So I ended up telling them to keep the white rice an I ordered a side of fried which was 7.95 a piece ... You would think they would compromise a little I spent over sixty bucks on take out ! But overall food was fantastic when it arrived to bad won't be able to afford to have it anytime soon !lol

Great experience ! Good place to have a date , food was good and they have a reasonable deal for a party of two, comes with two cups of soup , one appetizer an  two entrees plus two tiny desserts for 39.95 perfect amount  for two .The best part was the awesome friendly and accommodating bartender his name was Brian ! Kinda pricey but over all good defiantly will go back an hopefully Brian will be there !

I was so excited to go to this bar I just moved to the  neighborhood an there are not a lot of options an from what I had read seemed pretty cool ! Well wrong couldn't get service if my life depended on it , in fact   the bartender looked at us an turned her back like she was to good to serve us, they weren't very busy or I would understand,we were sitting at the bar might I mention !  ! Her loss an the restaurant I might not look like I have a lot of money but I am a great tipper an patron !  after not getting served a drink or any food we had to leave ...hungry an disappointed not to mention thirsty !!

Absolutely the worst Mexican food and service I have ever had! For one we were the only people in the place and we waited 20 minutes to have our order taken ! The margaritas are pre made and so is the food ! From the night before !!! I asked and they admitted it was from the night before ! Disgusting I got the taco lunch special which was three tiny " carne asada" taco which I made into two an only ate one and even that was one too many ! I got sick 25 minutes after I left and so did my partner who had the shredded beef enchilada style burrito  ! An to make matters worse the server came out an told my partner she was buying her a margarita because it looks like she is having a bad day ! Wow how insulting ! I want my 28 dollars back !!! I won't even drive by this place again !!!!

Wow ! Ok the truth hurts Mr.James H  what I wrote was all true !!! I get you work there so want to protect your job ! Yelp is for restaurant reviews and it's not high school ....

Went to the club last night and it was awesome !  First off they asked us were we heard about the club and we told them yelp and they gave us the five dollars off each of our tickets . We got seated in the front which made us a little uncomfortable so they moved us right away to amazing comfortable private seats in the back .there were a few comedians before the headliner Sarah Tiana they were ok but nothing compared to her she was super funny, witty ECT.We almost left before she came on but was enticed back in to watch her by Howard the host who by the way is also really funny and a amazing host and I am really thankful we went back in Sarah made the whole show ! We had food it was ok drinks were good and service was great! I can't wait to go back I think we just found our new favorite place !!
