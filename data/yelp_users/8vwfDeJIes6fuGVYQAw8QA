I thought this place was great! The rooms were huge and the beds were very comfortable. There's a small balcony which is nice. Plus having two separate rooms was great to watch tv while my girlfriend napped. Perfect place to watch a sporting event is definitely at the bar that has several TVs including a huge 72+ inches (id say) that is behind the bartender. Overall property is great.   The location if this place is great. It is right in the middle of old town so everything is in walking distance including two banks ( Wells Fargo and Chase Bank).   My only complaint would be the parking situation. They don't really offer too much on site parking without an additional charge.    So I got a stain on my shirt in my suitcase and the front desk agent gave me some laundry detergent and dryer sheets so I could was my shirt before wearing out that night! That really made my stay that much better!

This place was for me one of the worst buffets ever! I was really excited to go here after reading the review but was really disappointed with the food. The service and people were great but the food no where near that.   I was looking forward to the sushi, which was really bad I may add, so I then went to the buffet. The typical dishes were horrible and left a weird after taste. Even the soda we got was flat and had a really bad after taste.   The only thing I truest enjoyed was the Mongolian station.
