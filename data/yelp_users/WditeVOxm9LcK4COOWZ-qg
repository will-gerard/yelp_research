I almost didn't go there for dinner because of these bad views and that would have been a big mistake! The food was extraordinary (we had enchiladas, shrimp fajitas and my friend had the tamales). we ordered a pitcher of margarita and it was VERY strong on the tequila. I'll definitely go back!

We absolutely love the sushimen at Ah-So. They are so awesome and friendly. Try the Las Vegas roll or the Monsoon. They are to die for.

So, we ordered 6 pizzas tonight for my son's b-day party. They got 2 pizzas wrong. We went back to complain and got attitude from them and no apologies. Are we ever going back? Nope.

My favorite thing to get at Mimi's is their hot chocolate 'bucket'. It is the best in town (from a connoisseur like me!)

Love their appetizers!  It is a little too pricey to visit more than once a month though.

Don't listen to sour grapes giving bad review! The store is huge and I always find what I need. I especially love their selection on art materials.  Better even; they always give me a discount with a coupon, usually I get 40% off of 1 item. Follow this link for a coupon: http://www.hobbylobby.com/weekly/coupon.cfm

The best petting zoo and ice cream in town!!! And they have a community garden few people know about. Check it out.

My husband can't survive without Filiberto's breakfast burritos. I like their chicken taco salad and the tortas (sandwiches). Oh, and of course, their tamarindo juice is the best.
