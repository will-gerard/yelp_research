WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE HISTORY OF CUSTOMER SERVICES!!!!!!!  I bought tickets online to the downtown Phx location and I realized that this is the wrong location. The correct location is the AMC 14 (Dine-In). At 8:30pm I called the 1-800. Spoken to a rep, who was rude, not helpful at all. All we wanted was our money back or transfer tickets to the correct location. The rep talked over us, asked us the same questions over and over (our order/confirmation number) and that shows she didn't pay any attention to our story.   After repeating ourselves 3 times, she stated she can only give us $15.18 instead of 18.18 (what we've paid for).   We asked for a supervisor, she places us on a 3min hold, she came back "pretending" to be the supervisor. How we found out- The rep slipped up and said "I believe I was speaking with you earlier". Once we called her out on it and demanded to speak to a supervisor, she hung up on me.   I called back!!  Demanded to speak to a sup right away, the same rep answered. The rep wanted to know why? And I explained that she hung up on me. The rep said "hold on" placed me on another 7min hold, she hung up on me AGAIN!   Your employee is a reflection on your company and I want no part of it, and I will let everyone know how your employees treat loyal customers!!   GOOD LUCK

A few co workers and I decided to go during lunch hour. When we walked in, we were greeted right away. We were also seated right away.   Our waitress was nice and helpful with the menu. We had unlimited bread and salad. I asked for Caesar salad and she said she will just bring out the Caesar dressing. When the salad came out, the salad was already tossed in their signature dressing. Mixing Caesar dressing together was not a good taste so I didn't use it.   For my main course, I ordered a Sampler: Stuffed mushrooms and calamari. The taste was amazing. Very flavorful.   The only downfall was instead of all our food come out at once, the food came out one at a time. Me being the last person to get my food, everyone was almost done eating. The manager was informed of this issue and took off $2.50 off my meal and acknowledge their mistake.   I would go to Olive Garden again for the simple fact of admitting service was not up to par.

Going to Z for a few years the menu and pricing has changed. Happy hour prices increased and the times changed. It doesn't seem so much of a happy hour anymore.   Corn bread was one of their specialties that was free, you now have to pay for it if you want it. Drastic changes like that, will have consumers second guess coming again.   Their 3 limit Chambord has always been, however, Dos Gringos sale the same drink and its unlimited.   Lastly, the CatFish Beignets use to be so white and fresh looking inside. Now it looks very veiny and dark. The batterer is good and that Sauce is still amazing so please do not ever change that.   I believe to stay in business, Z need to revamp their menu, prices and happy hour.

This place is quit AMAZING! The only down fall was the wait time. The restaurant receptionist said it would be a 45min wait, however we waited 20 minutes if that. I was not aware of making reservations, next time, it will be smart to do so.   When we were seated, we had two waitress name Jenna and Cathy- I think Jenna was training Cathy as a server. Anyway, they were both courteous, nice, and gave a really good descriptions on the whole menu, as this was my first time here.   I ordered two appetizers, a salad and two mimosas. The appetizers were Rib Eye Potstickers which was a very strong BBQ taste to it. Definitely not a an appealing taste. On the other hand, Salmon bits were to die for. Every single bite, I was sad that it was gone. Luckily, there are 4 bite size and it was very satisfying. My main course- Turkey Salad was scrumptious! I would definitely buy it again. Lastly, the two mimosas was very delish!   Overall, with the server, food, and overall service, I will go again in a heart beat.

Overall service was awesome.   From the time we walked in to the time we left, all the servers were attentive. We had one main waitress, however, 3 additional servers came to us to top our waters off or simply asked how the food was.   Food was amazing as well as the drinks. I love the whole idea of picking a beverage depending on how you would want to feel after finishing the drink: Get to the Point, Refresh, Divergent, and Play it Safe. The drinks served was spot on.   I will definitely come back a third, fourth, fifth time!
