Is my love for Houstons waning?! A much anticipated visit to the Phoenix "Houston's" turned out to be a disappointment. Hillstone is the parent company as well as a number of other restaurants such as Bandera (Chicago), Rutherford Grill (Napa Valley), and Woodmont Grill (Bethesda, MD). I once had an aspiration to visit every Houston's but am now reconsidering. Unfortunately, the Phoenix visit is where this reconsideration started.   We went in for an early weekday lunch. Our server was polite but acted like he was being forced to be nice...fake enthusiasm with a lot of teeth showing.  His enthusiasm didn't translate to familiarity with the menu. He told me that the kale chicken salad was like the regular chicken salad - somewhat accurate but much less helpful than explaining the differences to me when I told him that I had eaten the chicken salad many times. NOT the same in volume nor flavor.  And I have more general angst against Hillstone/Houstons: - Rarely offer open table or other reservation system - No more off the menu classics but stil a limited number of menu selections - Wine selections have become more pedestrian over the years   C'mon Hillstone...step up!

Great service and nice atmosphere.  I had the scallops which were good although a bit rich for my taste (nothing low fat about that dish).  Service was excellent. Our waiter was patient with our table (not everyone could decide on dinner selections quickly) and helpful.   We found a Ramey Syrah on the wine list that was both delicious and reasonable - something you don't find on a lot of steakhouse wine lists.

Great wine bar - good list ... I ordered the Chateau Smith cab. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough to classify as a complete glass (very generous pours!) so they offered to give me another half glass of something else (a very generous half glass!).   My friend and I wanted a small bite of something. We ordered the cheese plate to split, and the waiter suggested that we get only a half order - he was right! The cheese was piled on the plate, maybe not the most high end but it worked.

Wonderful! My friends in Phoenix had not tried this spot but it was close and the menu looked good.  The wine list is impressive: Peter Franus, Caduceus (AZ winery owned by Tool lead singer Maynard Keenan), Orin Swift and DeLille! I had a glass of Peter Franus cab, recently well rated by Wine Spectator. I think the waiter thought i Was a bit weird when I went on about how great the list was. :)  For dinner, I had the North Central Chicken, grilled red chile glazed chicken  with roasted poblano creamed corn, mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. The meal was delicious. I wouldn't have expected that mashed potatoes would pair well with the chile glaze but the chili flavor was mild.   My only regret was that I had to leave Phoenix with only one meal at Sierra Bonita - I'll be back.

I am a big ihop fan although I rarely indulge given the portion size usually leading to an afternoon nap. However, we were on vacation and it seemed like an ideal time to indulge in a pancake fix wit a side of some egg concoction.  The waitress was prompt, professional and took and delivered our drink orders quickly.  We weren't as lucky in the food. The ordering was prompt but we waited about 25 minutes to have the food delivered. Unfortunately the pancakes were too brown and the syrup was cold. Omelettes were good so all was not bad, however, my pancake indulgence was severely disappointing.

After a bit of confusion about the location (google maps still lists only the old location although it notes that it is closed), we found our way to Pomo. The place was hopping! It had a wonderful outdoor area as well as tables inside. And the shiny silver tile-encrusted indoor pizza oven looks like it comes out of a science fiction movie, but it certainly puts out the pizza.   We started with salads - a Romano and a misto (field greens) salad which were both large enough to share. My recommendation would be for two people to share a salad or plan to share pizza or other main course.   All of us ordered pizzas which are thin crust and approximately 11-12 inches. I had the capricciosa which was excellent - prosciutto, olives, artichoke hearts and mushrooms. We all agreed that the pizzas were good albeit a bit soupy, maybe due to the fact that the 900+ degree pizza oven didn't allow them to be as crisp as other ovens.  They had a nice selection of Italian wines by the glass and service was excellent.
