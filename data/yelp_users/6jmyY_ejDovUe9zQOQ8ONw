Rant begin..... My husband and I went to Buffalo Wild Wings on McDowell and Dysart road to enjoy a few drinks and wings. Unfortunately 1/2 way through our dinner a mouse was roaming the restaurant near the kitchen and bar. We were disgusted along with multiple customers with the poor management led by Martin who did not acknowledge the issue and neglected to apologize for  the grotesque incident. He kept it hush hush... Not only did he not apologize, but he had the balls to try and inform us that the mouse couldn't enter the kitchen and there was no way our food was contaminated regardless of the swinging door from the dining area to the kitchen.... Does that make sense to anyone???? No!!!!! Our waitress understood our frustration and was very understanding and polite and apologized multiple times. The management at this facility should be reconsidered or should be put through the basic customer service training in which  most likely they give their new hires.... Rant over for now. #nevergoingback #disgusting

My mom and I always choose this restaurant as our go to for girls night! Every time we enter it is very busy, but the customer service is always great! We both get the Caesar salad and potato soup combo which never fails.

I requested a custom order to include white roses, hydrangeas, and calla lilies and the final product exceeded my expectations. The person I spoke with on the phone was very helpful and asked detailed questions about what type of bouquet we wanted i.e. modern, traditional, flower preference, occasion, etc. When the flowers were delivered right on time we were blown away at how grand and gorgeous the arrangement was. Great customer service, great product, and well worth the price. I will definitely be ordering from Blooming Expressions from here on out!
