If I could give a lower rating then one star I would. I just ate at the Coco's in Scotsdale Az. It was one of the worst ideas I ever had. I went with family we had 2 kids with us a baby, and an 8 year old. My brother and his girlfriend ordered stake, I ordered a chicken sandwhich and sweet patato fries, the kids had mac and cheese, and a pizza and fries.  Everything was COLD, all the sides cold, the kids food was cold, and the stakes were undercooked! I would never advise anyone I know to eat here, we told the manager, and all he took off the bill was the stakes, not my sandwhich, not the kids food, and I'm pretty sure we were over charged. The staff wasn't mean about it but I know they could have done better then just taking 2 things off the bill, since everything was cold.

This is an amazing place to eat, it was a treat! I went here with a group that included 6 adults, and 4 children. We were all happy with our orders, and the portions, and service were great.  I must say I grew up on Jamacian food, since my dad is from there. The curry chicken was amazing, and the rice & beans were perfectly cooked.  This place is a must for people who want to try food from the island.
