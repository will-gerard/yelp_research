I had been wanting to try this type of workout for awhile and finally bought an online deal for it. SO happy I did! This studio is such a great workout and all the instructors are so friendly! Have been four times but each time they were extremely polite in help correcting form while also giving us positive feedback and motivation during the class. The class is great for people of all ages and experience and in no way do I feel uncomfortable if I make a mistake or have to modify a movement. On top of the great class, the place is cute, clean and they have an easy locker system! I would HIGHLY  recommend this studio! :)

Absolutely love this wine bar!!! We went here on a date night and the service was excellent as well as the atmosphere, music, and menu. Our waiter James was really nice and made sure we were well taken care of and so did the owner Michael. The owner was seen on the floor checking on tables and the service. He stopped to talk to us a couple of times and made sure our experience was superb! The decor is very cool, the prices are very reasonable, and the live music they had was really good! Highly suggest this as a fun place to get together with friends or as a date night! This is definitely a new gem in Old Town! Will most certainly be returning soon!

I would not suggest going to this salon for a gel manicure. I was not near my normal nail salon and was in a pinch, I decided to try this salon out. Salon was empty so I was taken right away. The first woman who worked on my nails was kind but did not do a very good job. I had acrylics that needed to be taken off first and by the time she got them off and was filing, she kept filing my actual fingers making it painful. Meanwhile, I also had to point out nails that were uneven (very obvious, not me being nit picky). I then just wanted gel polish on top and that was a mistake. When she finished the polish looked as if a child had done it. I had gel polish on my fingers and it was not painted all the way to the base. The second coat was also uneven and not started where the first coat began.   At the end, she said taking the acrylics off was $10 when she originally said $5. I questioned the woman at the front desk and she seemed confused and said "Oh it's whatever she said." I walked out and when I further looked at my nails there was no way I was leaving like that. I walked back in and explained to two other employees what I was seeing and bothered by.   They asked about which light the first employee used to set the gel polish and they said she used the wrong one and agreed to fix it. She made comments about how she tells other workers to use the OPI light for OPI polishes but no one listens. The second time around was a bit better but still bad. I had to point out a part that was painted and there was still gel polish on my fingers and it looked unfinished at the base of the nail. At that point, I didn't want a third person attempting to fix it since the first two were not doing a good job.  I have had my nails done consistently for awhile now and am not extremely picky! I don't get crazy designs or colors, just basic nail jobs. So going in for plain gel polish on short nails, I do expect them to look clean and neat. The fact that the staff is not properly finishing a nail job is concerning. If there is a special light to use, it should be used. First and last time going to this salon!!!! I spent $35 on a job that took two people to work and way too much time. I had to go home and still get extra polish off. If I wanted to spend that much time and have them look unprofessional, I would have done them myself. Very disappointing, do not go here for gel polish!
