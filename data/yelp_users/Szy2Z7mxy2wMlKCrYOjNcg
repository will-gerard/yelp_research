One of my worst experience ever my eating pupusas.  With that said the owner took our order and she was rude not friendly at all..... 1. She get the order wrong 2. She food was kind of cold 3. Seen like she didn't want to be there (she is the owner) found out she was the when I was paying the bill 4. She was trying to over charge the bill postings images of bill.   5. She never told us about the drinks weren't free refills  6. Got mad when I pointed out that the bill was added wrong  7. Slam the bill on the table when she corrected it. Even my girlfriend who is calm was shocked 8. When the bill the guy owner said sorry for the bad service When noticed I not happy

The owner she is rude and has no customer service skills 3 times they have ruined my shirts The girls who work there are nice  I got mustard on my shirt asked them to clean it  I pick up the shirt and the stain is still there pointed to the owner she was like we can't get it removed I went home spend my time on it and now it gone. a average guy who knows nothing about cleaning. Got it removed.  Never going back there again  Try to be nice 3 times  3 time same poor results I wish there was another dry cleaner near me instead of this one I have to drive longer I guess

If there was an option to give them 10 stars, I would. Food just like my grandmother used to make it. Pupusas are really great. Must have if you're having Salvadoran food. A regular to all their locations.

Pizza is great! Remind me of back home.  The cheese is out of this world. And I can tell they take pride in their food since I found this place I haven't order pizza no where else
