Wow.  The food was very good and the service was good.  The food was fresh, the restaurant clean and the servings were adequate.  We will return to try some of their new dishes, including salmon tacos.

I recently had an antique desk I wanted to send to my nephew.  I contacted this UPS store and was told they could pack and ship this for us.  Everything went smoothly, and the desk was received in Ohio in perfect shape.  Great job for handling our family heirloom as carefully as we would.  Thank  you.

convenient location - often moved without notice or found ceilings falling or the restaurant flooded.  I quit going here because I don't feel they really value their customers.

I am so sorry this closed.  Dan's restaurant was clean, the food exceptional, and their service was excellent.  I hope he opens another something because this was hands down the best Cajun food in Phoenix.

This food is amazing!  Healthy, light and very tasty.  We've always received great service and the prices are fair.  This is worth the extra drive.

We recently visited the Angry Crab in Peoria and really enjoyed the seafood.  We got a combination of crab, shrimp, clams and vegetables - delicious!  I'm gad we asked for sides of the sauces because we weren't fond of them - basic seasoning was ok.  Very casual environment and they offer you a bib and lots of napkins because you eat with your hands.  We will go back.

I was questioning why we were driving so far for tacos; then I found out it was well worth the drive.  The Tuesday Tacos were wonderful!  Even though I'm not addicted to chocolate, I must say I tried the chocolate flourless torte and it was very good.  I liked it.  It was slow getting the bill, but while dining, people did check to see if the food was good.
