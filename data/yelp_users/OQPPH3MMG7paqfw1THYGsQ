OK, I admit, if you are going to Firestone for your auto care you probably don't have the highest level of knowledge about your cars inner workings nor do you want to spend time determining a proper shop for repairs.  That being said, I think Firestone Auto Care offers some decent services so long as you follow the rules.  These rules (as written by me) include:  1. Go there for the BASICS.  This includes oil changes, tire rotations, wheel alignments, and other routine maintenance services.  They do these things very well and  typically can't screw them up.  2. Go to their web site and print any coupons - they usually have a coupon for oil change, tire rotation, and alignment discounts.  This will save you money.  3. Decline any additional services or maintenance they suggest.  You are better off getting a second opinion from somewhere else.  On my visit for a wheel alignment, they did not push any unnecessary stuff on me.  When in doubt, check your manual.  If the routine maintenance is not listed, DO NOT PAY FOR IT.  If it is a repair item, get a second opinion.  4. Shop Around.  For routine services, Firestone will generally price match.  You'll need to have the name of the competitor, price, location, etc. but they do this without much hassle.  5. Make an appointment.  If you don't to this, you'll have to wait for several hours (no es bueno!)  That's it.  The service by location will vary, but I've had good luck with Firestone on Scottsdale Rd for tire rotations, oil changes, wheel alignments, and battery replacements.

OK, it's Subway so you get the general idea of the place.  I am a fan of this particular location for a couple of reasons:  1.  Parking - there is lots of it as it's next to a Bashas supermarket  2. Lunch Prep - they always have around 5 sandwich artists at this location at lunch.  They draw a brisk lunch crowd but move through it quickly   3, Ingredients - Their sandwich toppings are always fresh - never looked like they had sat out too long like some other places.  That's it!

Wanted to share my thoughts about Phil's Home Maintenance as they have done a lot of great work for me over the past year.  I actually found out about Phil's from one of their employees who is related to a friend of mine.  Phil's can do a lot of general "handyman" type things.  I have asked them to do a variety of tasks for me in the past, including:  - indoor/outdoor painting  - grouting  - caulking and sealing  - changing out hardware  - installing lighting  - tile cutting  Phil's charges a trip fee that includes your first 30 minutes of work.  You pay based on the amt of time that they spend on your job and any supplies that are needed (they have a well-stocked truck that enables them to do lots of stuff at your home).  I highly recommend Phil's Home Maintenance for all your small jobs around the house!  They make a great handyman!

Let's face it, junk is the antithesis of glamorous.  When you've got a big pile of crap you need hauled away, any guy with a truck will do, right?  WRONG.  You want someone that will be on time, is willing to clean up the area where the junk is after they've picked everything up, is polite and fluent in English, thinks of value-added services like emptying your trash bin, and represents a local business that you can patronize.  Junk Guys ticked all these boxes for me.  THe guys were great and helped me out when I needed some items hauled away from a house that I had sold.  I'd highly recommend them over an unknown entity or a big corporate junk removal company.  So go get your crap hauled away by the Junk Guys - you'll thank me!

I'll echo what others have said - Dr. Cooper is an EXCELLENT dentist who not only does great work, he really cares about his patients.  I discovered Dr. Cooper from the previous Yelp reviews and needed a dentist in AZ as I had moved from out of state.  In addition to the regular cleanings, I had to have some additional work done (replacing some old fillings that had failed and get 2 new ones) over the course of about 3 years.  Dr. Cooper always told me exactly what needed to be done, showed me the issue on his comuputer (via xrays he had taken), and documented the work digitally so I could see before, during, and after shots if I wanted to.  Dr. Cooper also calls you after a procedure to ensure that you are doing OK which I always appreciated.  Finally, Dr. Cooper wasn't on my insurance plan so they only covered "reasonable and customary" charges.  Despite this, Dr. Coopers prices were fair and they always could give me an esimated out of pocket cost prior to doing the work.  If you are in need of a dentist in North Scottsdale, I'd highly recommend Dr. Cooper.  I only wish I could still see him as I moved to CA but have already found another great dentist courtesy of Yelp!

Another 5 star review for Tom and Brandon.  I had a water leak right off my water main / meter and called them on Jan 2 to schedule an appt.  Tom got me scheduled the next day and Brandon called ahead to let me know when he would be there as I had a dentist appt that afternoon.  Brandon was on time, polite, knowledgeable, and pretty efficient.  The price seemed very fair given the amount of work needed and he quoted it up front (Which I really appreciated).  Brandon also noticed some issues around my water heater that needed attention and gave me a very fair quote to come back and fix them.    They honored the Yelp special of no trip charge and 10% off as well!  I would highly recommend Sav-On Plumbing and will be doing business with them again!

I am writing this review of Right Honda based solely on their service department.  I have no experience with the sales team there.  I took my wife's 1998 Honda Accord to Right Honda for its 60k service.  They were very friendly but they were quick to walk me through everything they were going to do and their estimate was significantly higher than both Greg's Japanese auto and my old Honda dealer in WA state.  When I asked them to break down the parts/labor cost estimate, they were reluctant to do so.  As I probed deeper, they were only willing to give me their labor rate which was over $100 per hour!  I decided to go elsewhere based on this experience and would encourage others to shop around - Right Honda has very high labor rates for service and you might get a better deal from another dealer or Greg's (my personal choice).

I like Golden Spoon.  There, I said it.  Golden Spoon was introduced to me by my wife (who is a big fan from California, where GS is well entrenched).  I'm a fro-yo fan and frankly, there aren't a lot of good choices in Phoenix.  Plus, I'm a bit of a traditionalist and don't like all the "Pinkberry-esque" places with green tea flavors and fresh fruit toppings.  I want my yogurt served straight up, and I want a lot of choices of yogurt.  Golden Spoon delivers in spades in this regard.  There are usually a dozen or so flavors to choose from.  The sugar content is very reasonable, and if you want just a little bit they have a kiddie size that is about $2 - very reasonable.  The portions are pretty big so don't order a larger size if you don't want it piled up.  One suggestion if you like to add toppings is to ask for a larger sized cup so that the toppings don't overflow out of the cup.  My favorite flavors are Peanut Butter Cup and Heath Bar - they go great together side-by-side

Clearly BevMo! is an acquired taste.  You either like it or you hate it.  I personally like it.  A lot.  A whole lot.  I drive from N Scottsdale to BevMo for a few reasons:  1. Their 5 cent sale (on as I am writing this) - buy one bottle of featured wine, get the second for 5 cents.  This only goes on sporadically but they often have very good wines available.  Do your homework before you go (you can see on their website when the 5 cent sale is going on and what is available) but you can save some decent money this way.  2. Lots of KEG BEER! - If you need a pony keg or full-sized keg for some kind of event, this is the place to go.  They have a huge selection of mainstream and microbrew type stuff available.  I wouldn't necessarily go here for a pony keg of bud as you can likely find it cheaper somewhere else, but if you like Red Hook ESB or Alaskan Amber and have to have it on tap, order your keg here.  3. Selection - I like different types of liquor that usually are only stocked by big box booze shops like BevMo! and Total Wine.  If you want a broad selection of stuff to choose from and rarer items, go here.  There isn;'t necessarily a rhyme or reason to their pricing, though.  Sometimes the mainstream stuff is more expensive here than it would be with a club card at your local grocery store.  As others have pointed out, the customer service is just OK.  Clearly the employees don't get the same kind of benefits as Starbucks or Costco retail folks, and it shows.  However, they keep things moving, know where to find things, and are willing to check around for stuff if they are out of stock.  Give BevMo! a try if you are looking for a different booze shopping experience - you'll either love it or hate it!

Note: The Company that owned Scottsdale Auto Salon (Scottsdale Auto Salon LLC) Declared Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in early March 2009.  The facility is being operated by the bank according to employees that now staff it.  "Auto Salon" and "Auto Spa" are terms that only get thrown around in Scottsdale apparently.  In the rest of the civilized world, these places are simply known as car washes.  Sadly, the only thing that appears to differ between an auto salon/spa and a car wash is the price and the propensity of the staff to try and upsell you to a super-carnuba waxy goodness package for $60.  Since SAS went chapter 11 on me, they have definitely slid down the ranks for attention to detail and service.  Of course, the flip side is the employees are likely no longer paid on commission since they are paid by the finance company that now owns this establishment, so upsells are few and far between.  If there is one good thing about SAS, it is that they will accept competitors coupons so you can find the best coupon and take it in to get them to match it.  Overall, they didn't spend much time drying my car and missed cleaning most of the windows.  Used to be very detail oriented but now I would say that Cobblestone is better (although you have to deal with the ongoing upsells at Cobblestone).  Don't go out of your way to go to SAS, but if you live in or near McDowell Mountain Ranch and have a good car wash coupon it might be worth your time.

The location has closed (AGAIN).  Not good if you have prepaid washes or other credits as the business has closed.  Some speculation on other sites is that they have filed for bankruptcy again.  Don't bother stopping by to use their services as the facility is cordoned off and a big sign says "business closed".

First off, let me say that I've only lived in Phoenix for two years and one of my biggest struggles has been finding good contractors to do work on my home.  I was lucky enough to stumble across Phil's Home Maintenance courtesy of one of their employees.  Phil's recommended Miguel at Flores Air Conditioning and Heating and send all a/c related issues to them.  Miguel is very up-front and easy to work with.  He charges a flat fee for a service call (in my case it was $90) and then additional charges for any supplies or parts that are necessary.  He has a big truck like the other guys that contains lots of parts and supplies so he can do lots of jobs on-site.  One thing everyone in the valley should know about the "big guys" that do a/c work is that the person that comes to your door is paid on commission.  This means it's in his/her best interest to get you to sign the biggest possible invoice possible.  I am not saying that they all do this, but Miguel doesn't operate in this fashion at all.  I highly recommend Miguel and Flores Air conditioning and heating.  Fully licensed, bonded, and insured.  Serves almost all the valley.  ROC 198122 C39R ROC 198123 L39

Frozen yogurt has been slow to catch on in Phoenix (at least from my vantage point).  I'm not sure why - living here in the summer is like camping on the surface of the sun.  Places like CA have been overrun with these places for some time - including the self-serve, pay-by-weight concept that I'm speaking about today - Yogurtology.  First off, Yogurtology is centered at the edge of McDowell Mountain Ranch on the corner of Frank Lloyd Wright (FLW) and Thompson Peak Parkway.  There are thousands of well-off folks in this area not to mention the throngs of kids from Notre Dame Prep and the like that swarm this place after 3:00 on the weekdays.  A good location and an approach that suits the demographics of the area.  The premise is simple (and has been discussed in other reviews):  Step 1: Choose flavor(s) from the myriad that are available the day you go in (there are about 10 to choose from on any given day)  Step 2: pour as much as you like of each flavor into a cup  Step 3: add any of roughly 30 different toppings and 5 sauces to your frozen conoction  Step 4: Weigh and pay  Step 5: Gorge  It's a pretty simple setup and one that you can find in other areas of Scottsdale.  What I like about this particular outlet is:  1. Selection - there are a lot more flavors here than some other outlets I've been to.  In addition, the selection of toppings is IMMENSE.  I am not sure who wants jumbo gumballs on top of their yogurt but they have that topping if you want it.  2. Access - not too far off the 101, near my house, LOTS of parking.  3. Service - unlike many yogurt stores (e.g. Ice Tango) the place is staffed by adults who ask you if you've been in before and offer a guided tour and free samples depending on what you need/want.  I personally like this approach and think it doesn't make newbies feel like idiots if they stumble in here after a shopping excursion at AJ's  So there you have it - yummy yogurt in an attractive wrapper.  If I lived closer to Golden Spoon I might give that the nod over Yogurtology as I like the consistency of their soft-serve a bit better and their nutritional info is clearly posted, but for now Yogurtology reins supreme in McDowell Mountain Ranch

Scheduled a repair with Dino's for my dryer (the drum had stopped spinning).  They gave me a time estimate and weren't able to meet it (which is why I didn't give them 5 stars) but they were polite about it.  Apparently the motor was going bad and the cost to replace it wasn't really worth it when compared to buying a new dryer.  Since they were way behind (and it was almost Christmas) they went ahead and waived the trip fee (which I appreciated) and we agreed that I'd just buy a new dryer.  Overall, I'd recommend Dino's and would use them again if I have an appliance problem.

I also called Mike to get some concealed wiring done for a TV that I already had mounted.  I was interested in adding a home theater hookup to improve sound and hide the HDMI cable that connected everything.  Mike was professional, asked lots of questions to understand what I wanted to do, and had good flexibility in scheduling so I could get everything done in the timeframe I wanted.  As the previoius review notes, he is great at taking his time to ensure everything gets done correctly, cleans everything up, and tests everything to make sure it works properly.  He also is very knowledgeable about technology and can help you get everything set up as well if you want that kind of support.  Thanks for the help mike!

I was pleasantly surprised to see a number of positive reviews from the Yelp faithful for a sports bar/grill, so the wife and I decided to head over for some college football over Labor Day weekend.  The layout is great with a long bar and two big areas for seating.  One area is mostly high-top tables and is more bar-centric.  The other area is almost all large booths with plenty of space for 8+ folks per table.    The TVs are EVERYWHERE and cover just about every seating angle.  It's definitely a sports bar that also has a big menu, not a restaurant that also shows sporting events.  Sound is turned up for most games so you had better be there for a game and not just to eat as there is no escaping the TVs and sound.  The good news is that if you are there to watch sports, there's plenty to like besides all the TVs.  There were over 15 beers on tap plus an equal number of bottled choices.  My wife said her mixed drink was well made and plenty strong - they also have a specialty drink list for those that like a little help selecting their beverage.   The menu was BIG and the food we ordered was very tasty.  My wife got the Rib Sampler off the appetizer list which consisted of four "fall of the bone" pork ribs that were served very hot and were really good.  I got the Buffalo Chicken Salad which was well made, had good crisp chicken, hot buffalo sauce, and lots of greens.  If there was one critique of the food list, it was that it could be a bit repetitive across the categories (e.g. Buffalo chicken wrap, salad, burger, strips, etc.)  The staff was friendly and accomodating - service was quick and they accepted a coupon I had from localdines for $30 of food with no issues (something I recommend grabbing if you are headed here anytime soon).  we'll definitely be back for whatever the next "big game" is - Blue 32 is a cut above the Zipps and Fox Sports Grills in Scottsdale and worth serious consideration for your next sports-fueled food fest might be.

I recently got a new car and wanted to make sure I had a good polish and wax job done before summer gets here.  Phoenix is known for eating the unprotected paint off of cars in the summer heat.    I called Andrew from ANS auto detailing after reading about him here on Yelp.  Andrew was very courteous, had competitive pricing, and worked with me to find a time that worked with my schedule.  ANS is s fully mobile detail shop.  This keeps their overhead low and allows them to travel to you for the same price that you'd pay to take your car somewhere else.  They use Meguiar's auto products which is a very respectable brand and definitely know their stuff.  The detailer that came to me was on time, very polite, and walked through exactly what he was going to do.  A full exterior detail (wash, clay bar, polish, wax) took a little under two hours.  The car was immaculate when he was done and he had clearly improved the finish of my new car.  The detailer also went the extra mile by pointing out the scratches on the chrome that he couldn't get out (I would never have found them on my own) and asking me to take a good look around to ensure I was fully satisfied.  I definitely was.  The reason for the four star review was because, a day later when I looked at the car, it was clear he had missed some spots where there was still  bit of wax between the insignia on the back of my car and a couple other areas.  I spent about 5 minutes touching up those spots with a microfiber cloth and that took care of it.  In the futire, I'd expect them to take care of this (and for me to catch it) so they are definitely capable of a 5 star review from me in the future.  give them a call a try them out!
