First time here, and I devoured the teriyaki chicken plate w/spring rolls! SO MUCH FOOD -- and I only ordered the lunch special! It could have easily fed two people, but if it is that good, why share? I love places like this. Simple restaurant specializing in something they do best, and this is the place to come for teriyaki. My food arrived at my patio table in less than 10 minutes. The salad had a delicious citrusy/sesame tasting dressing that mixed well with the rice and chicken. Chicken was so tender, and the teriyaki was neither too sweet or salty! Perfect taste. Since I like super spicy food, my only regret was not squirting Sriracha sauce all over it. However, I didn't realize that until AFTER I was half way done with my meal. It was so flavorful my spicy craving didn't even kick in I was way too full to continue on.   Good for lunch or early dinner since this place closes early. Drive-up window if you are in a rush!

I love Mexico City, and good tacos are hard to come by here in the states. The al pastor was really good, and I will definitely be coming back for the tacos!   They had some of the best horchata I've had in Phoenix, make sure you try it. I ordered the huarache, but was not too impressed. It was a little bland for being a specialty item. If you've ever eaten a huarache in DF, you might be disappointed in that dish. Overall, this place was great and I will be back again.

I recently moved from Idaho, and Jiffy Lube has always been my #1 choice. I only hoped I'd find a Phoenix location that exceeded my expectations the way my Idaho locations did.   The verdict? Fantastic service! Thanks guys.   Let me tell you that I don't know crap about cars. I went there thinking my oil needed changed because my car was making a strange noise (turned out to be a belt). I was past the 3,000 mile mark on my car and thought maybe the employees could see if some fluids were low or otherwise just change my oil. After 10 minutes of waiting the gentleman informed me my oil is 60% full and pretty much branch new. All fluids were full too. He said I could change my filter if needed, and even then it wasn't necessary. He also said my issue sounded more like a belt problem. Meanwhile, without me actually paying for a service the other guys were wiping down my dash and windows!   I felt no pressure to purchase anything since I really didn't need to. I felt embarrassed for thinking that I needed an oil change, but the guys didn't treat me any differently. They were genuine, friendly, honest people. I will 100% be back to PURCHASE a service when my car is ready! It's service like this that makes me gladly pay a little more here than a cheaper place with sub-par service.   Keep up the great work!

Employees are friendly and helpful since this was my first time here. However, I'm writing this review as I'm so bored after waiting for over an hour for my car to be washed and serviced. I will finish this when I get my car back!  So I just ended up going inside to check on my car, and it has been done for who knows how long. The guy who originally took my car said he would call me when it was done. Obviously that didn't happen since my car was finished and I was waiting for nothing. I read the other reviews while I waited, an they weren't very good. Hmm...I'm not swearing this place off some I live down the street, but I will definitely be more prepared. Remember: watch for your car, don't get huddled to fix scratches on your car, go on Tues, Wed, Thur for an oil change---you get a free wash.

I've always been a MAC user, but being from Boise I wasn't sure what type of service I would receive here at Paradise Valley Mall. Employees are super helpful here! My sister-in-law got her makeup done here for her wedding, and the gentleman who did it was FABULOUS! I'm so sorry I can't remember his name, but he is tall, dark and adorable, and is extremely talented at what he does. When I need to restock my make-up collection, I will be back, and hopefully have that guy give me some tips!

Great service! After struggling to find a gas station in Scottsdale and running on fumes, I turned into this place for some gas. I've never been to a full service station, and I still don't know if I should have tipped or what! The attendant was super friendly, quick, and even washed my windshield.

Who isn't always searching for the most delicious cupcake? I have, and I'm pretty sure I found it in the brown velvet. I tried six flavors, no not all in one sitting, but the brown velvet tops the list. Cakes are moist, and the frostings are all unique and heavenly in flavor. The cream cheese and raspberry frostings are to die for. Service is quick too. Again, I love when places don't have dozens of options to choose from like Sprinkles, and stick with what they do best. I also appreciate how they try to use as many local, organic ingredients as possible. They also introduce limited time flavors like peach, if peaches are in season! How cool is that?

My husband and I stayed here while traveling to Phoenix. Buildings are nice, and parking is plentiful. It is an extended stay hotel so there are some rooms that look like apartments overflowing with personal decorations. It is very pet friendly as I saw nearly 10 people with dogs in the lawn. My bigger concern was security. The walls are paper thin, and I heard a domestic dispute in the room above me. I called the front desk at 1 am to report loud commotion and screaming. The man said he would send security, and I think he did because it stopped. I had I call again at 7 am because it started for the second time. The girl at the front desk seemed apathetic toward my call, an didn't offer security or anything. I wouldn't recommend this place for a family with young children. My husband and I are in our twenties, but I wouldn't feel safe with kids.

This was my second trip to Phoenix, and nothing sounded better on a warm spring day like a tasty Greek lunch. I was not disappointed here! I ordered the chicken shawarma and a side of french fries for $6.99. The shawarma chicken was lightly seasoned with Mediterranean spices (perfect for a light lunch), and served in a fluffy warm pita with fresh tomatoes, onions and tahini. This pita was much larger than I expected for a lunch portion, but delicious none the less. The flavors of this dish completely satisfied my craving for a Mediterranean style lunch. It left me curious, and wanting to try other pitas and dishes on the menu. The patio seating was nice, cool and laid back. I'll definitely be back again soon, and I'm excited to try the spanikopita next time!

I said this place is "as good as it gets" because it really is if you want to indulge your inner girly-girl. I went here with my sister-in-law and our other female relatives the day before her wedding and we were pampered in a room of pink, sparkles and pretty things. They had an old movie playing (from the 50's maybe?) and yes, a Backstreet Boys song. The decor was modern, but super feminine. The front of the store was merchandised with unique, pretty accessories, jewelry and clothing pieces that were definitely impulse buys if you weren't careful! Coming here to get a mani/pedi was definitely a treat. I would recommend coming here if you want to pamper yourself, host a bridal party, birthday party or whatever with a group of friends. They will not be disappointed!

The happy hour prices were decent, but I'd be willing to pay much more for better service. Waitress was not very friendly, and our drink orders were few and far in between. You can't really screw up chips and salsa, but this place had greasy stale tortilla chips and very mild and somewhat "old" tasting salsa. You could probably find better food at a school cafeteria.

I've been a member for a month now, and I guess I'm able to get my workout done. I do find myself annoyed how cramped it can get by the weights. Like most of the reviews mentioned some of the equipment is older, but it suffices. I worked out at the LA Fitness on 3rd/Bell and it was AMAZING! It was so clean, nice, and new--tv's on EVERY cardio machine. When I came back to this location I felt BLAH.

This is my second review of this place, and I had to give it one star this time. This place deserves it. Overcrowded is an understatement, but the most disappointing thing is the quality/shape of equipment and overall cleanliness. It's the little things that really ticked me off. First, the employees are often hanging around chatting while the paper towel dispensers are empty and garbage litters the weight area. If equipment is out of order it usually takes a few weeks to get repaired. Cardio equipment is grimy, sticky and outdated. For those patrons who litter the areas and don't clean up on themselves, seriously get some manners. However, the lack of pride in this establishment from the employees makes it OK for rude people to trash the place. I would be embarrassed to work there in the shape it is in. This place is a straight up dump and a waste of my time and money. I've been to another LA Fitness in town and it was like a different world. New, clean, friendly employees. Imagine that! I've only been a member since May, and as soon as I'm done writing this review I'm looking for a BETTER gym close to my home.   It's really a shame. The worst part is I think the employees know this place is a dump and just don't give a damn.

Favorite things:  1. Blood Orange Martini 2. Thai Fish Cakes 3. Fish Bites 4. Cool, modern, retro decor 5. Great patio area 6. Really great bar service 7. Location  Only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars:  1. Price, however it redeems itself during happy hour!  I have a favorite drink now, and it is the Blood Orange Martini from Hula's. The Pink Bikini is good, and if you want more bang for your buck order the Zombie. Tiki drinks run about $7 or $5 during happy hour. Really great place to relax, but if you are on a budget this place can be a bank buster. The appetizers all look amazing, and I've order fish bites, thai fish cakes, and sweet potato fries. Mmm...the fish is so fresh and the dipping sauces have me swooned just as much as the BO martini. I'll frequent this place more often, but know that 3 drinks or 2 and an appetizer is gonna run me around $25...eek.

I'm giving this place five stars because there isn't a place like it. Healthy, Mediterranean, interesting hummus options, and great drink specials? Come on, this place has it all if you like all of those things. The name made me think this place was going to be a walk-in joint with a sub-par menu. I ate at the downtown PHX location, and I was completely surprised! Eat out on the patio if you can. It's a lovely setting with stringed lights overhead, and alley views. You get a real urban setting here, and delicious food. I had a pesto turkey pita and my husband had the Philly cheese steak one. We ordered the cilantro jalapeno hummus = this is a must try. We didn't go during happy hour, but the menu had really great prices $3-$7 for drinks and small plates. Portions are generous. ambiance is great for date nights or casual drinks with friends.

Where do  I begin? If you've ever been to a self serve yogurt shop, this place is no different. I guess it only has 12 flavors than 36, but still...nothing mind blowing. Pomegranite blueberry sorbet is pretty good, but otherwise it's just ok. Interesting topping selection though if you are into that. Oh, decor is pretty sleek. Cool, modern. Yeah...

A beautiful lounge with fantastic service and excellent drinks! Try the American Gothic if you like bourbon. This place is pretty packed at night, but if you want something a little more low-key go during the day. Joy was my bar tender and she was so sweet and offered great recommendations. She made one hell of a drink! I will definitely make this place a regular stop every time I'm in Vegas!

Careful, you can easily miss the building when driving by! Order family style dishes to share: lemongrass beef Cambodian stir fry, mmm...  I've never eaten Cambodian before so that is why I'm giving it 5 stars. I love the quaintness of the dining room, and there are books about Cambodia on each table that make for great dinner conversation. Staff is friendly and helpful in ordering. Our food was super flavorful, and tasted like Cambodian comfort. I don't have anything to compare it to, but I would image this would be their version of "home cooking." The lemon grass beef stir fry was excellent, and I experienced about 3 different flavor explosions in my mouth while chewing each bite-- same with the Cambodian fried rice. I only wish we ordered the chicken wings because everyone around us were...they looked incredible. I will be back soon to try something new on their menu.

I heard this place is really fun at night with the live music -- haven't done that yet. Went after work for happy hour on a Thursday, and it was super chill with a great beer selection and awesome cheese bread for an appetizer. If you are a hummus lover, don't get it here...it's not that good. I got the Papago Orange Blossom beer, and it was awesome! Service is better than I expected too.

$16 is a little more than I typically spend on an eyebrow wax, but it was worth every dollar. I will say, the girl really went to town on my brows and it even hurt a little, but she got EVERY damn hair out of there! Well worth the suuuper minor discomforts! She did a great job with the hair removal and shape. Gosh, and it smells so damn good in there! Also, beware of the adorable (expensive) jewelry they have for sale -- I may just have to by some earrings the next time I'm in.

Ice cream always sounds good on a hot Phoenix day, but usually I leave unsatisfied after a trip to the self-serve froyo shops or places like Baskin Robbins. I stumbled upon this gem downtown inside the Fair Trade Coffee shop. I was mainly entranced by the select flavors they had to offer. In terms of quality and taste, I've never had a more creamier and elegantly flavored ice cream that tastes the way frozen cream should. I had horchata flavor on my first visit, and although I could taste the delicate hints of cinnamon and rice milk nothing was overpowering and you could taste the purity of the ingredients. If you bought this flavor from let's say, Dryers, you have an over sweetened over processed cold mess. On my second trip I had a scoop of horchata and a scoop of birthday cake. Best birthday cake flavor EVER. The owner of the place serves locally made ice cream from some lady in Scottsdale I think. He makes the waffle cones fresh, and they are crispy and a little chewy at the same time. You can't beat staying open until 2am on the weekends either. It's a perfect way to wind down after some drinks with friends. Keep in mind if you are looking for a mountain of scoops like you get at Coldstone--you will be disappointed. The beauty of serving a natural, local, homemade product is that the portion is not massive, which is essentially wasteful. They don't need to overcompensate in serving size to make up for crap taste. A little scoop goes a long way.

Finally! I found my favorite yogurt place. I've only come across franchise shops, and was never very impressed. The decor and layout was thoughtfully designed with bar seating along the main window for superb people watching and a sweet comfy lounge area for great conversation and yogurt eating. Patio seating is available too. Besides the yogurt, I loved the stack of sketch books and cups of colored pencils for guests to doodle!  Now, on to the most important thing = YOGURT! Hands down, the most flavorful and refreshing. Some chains compromise quality in order to provide 15+ flavors, but this place didn't need to. Also, the yogurt was flavored perfectly w/o too much artificial flavoring.   Favorites:  1. Caramel w/cheesecake bits (...and I don't even like caramel, but this converted me!) 2. Strawberry banana 3. Cheesecake w/oreos 4. I got a sorbet I think too, can't remember the name but it was wonderful! 5. Fantastic, personable employees! I only spoke with a woman who was working, but she was so nice and friendly. Also, right when we walked in we were immediately greeted.   I will never buy fro yo anywhere else. Unless I happen to be traveling outside Phoenix!

This place is still trying to figure itself out. The decor is simple, so it made me think they must be saving all of the excitement for the food. I ordered chicken tinga and some pork tacos. The meat in both tacos was pretty decent, but the tortillas were too oily. I suggest frying the tortilla longer or just grilling them? I'd love to give them a second try, perhaps to try one of their specialty dishes.

The Manhattan deserves a million stars!!! I have yet to try a Manhattan here in town that comes close to B&T's masterpiece. Try it. Now.  I'm surprised at how many cocktail options are on the menu. I know it's a cocktail parlor, but it was overwhelming. Their signature drinks are interesting, but it's the classic cocktails that I think they make the best.   Ambiance - The area by the bar is super cool, try to score a table there. The dining room seems to be confused about the style it is trying to be. The decor in my opinion, is too contemporary for the historic building.   Service - great service every time.  Price - on the high side, but order a Manhattan and you're golden ;-) Very strong!  Food - the fries chicken with watermelon kimchi is bomb! Oh, and the popcorn is super delish.

I want to give this place five stars so bad! I just can't, yet.   I've been here three times, and each time left me a mix of disappointment (service) and satisfaction (food).   The service is still not consistent. The first time I went, the host and server were super friendly and things were going just fine. I ordered the carnitas taco, and it was a little bland. I ordered some crispy flautas that were good, but not mind blowing. However, I really enjoyed the house margarita for $3! I was interested enough to return for a second round.   Second visit was on a Saturday night, and the place was packed! The energy was great, and we were seated by the food counter inside. After a minute of sitting the cooks kept yelling "Order Up!!!" every few minutes. It kept startling me, and I just could. not. concentrate. My suggestion, remove that table position. It's a busy spot, and between the music and the "order ups!" I couldn't hear myself think. There weren't any other tables available that night, so we had to stay put. Honestly, I can't even tell you about the food because I was so distracted by the yelling that I just ate and left asap. I think I had, tinga tacos?   The third time I had excellent Tinga tacos! The best! However, the service was really below average. Our server was nice enough at first, but we kept waiting for 10+ minutes for margarita refills. He also kept forgetting to bring us things we asked for (salsa, chips, guac). I am definitely not a rude patron, so I didn't say anything --I just had to politely remind him several times. He never wrote anything down which could have been the problem...

When I saw this place being built a few months ago, I couldn't wait to get my behind inside! I finally had the chance to stop by for a quick macchiato and scone. Wow! I was super impressed with my simple meal. The staff was incredibly helpful and sweet. The decor is beautiful, bright, and rustic. In fact, I just returned from a month long trip in Mexico City where I ate at some of the best cafes. I was a little sad to leave them behind knowing I would not find such places on every corner of Phoenix. I found the essence of some of those cafes in Fame Caffe, so thank you! The black and white back splash behind the counter was super tasteful, and added an art-deco element of design again the modern, rustic decor (similar to what I saw abroad).   Back to the food though...  I bought a scone because I thought, why not? I'm here for coffee, yada yada yada. The moment I bit into the cranberry scone, I knew I had to come back for more. It was fresh, flavorful, and hands down muy rico! The espresso was absolutely delightful, and presented exactly how I would order it from the cafes in Mexico City.   Coming here was just what I needed as I was coming off my post-vacation blues. Great service, quality food, and damn good espresso. I'm coming back for brunch, and I'm a woman of habit so you will probably see me often.
