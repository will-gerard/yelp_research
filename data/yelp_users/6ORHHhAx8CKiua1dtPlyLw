Very unprofessional and rude employees. Bank of america is already a terrible financial institution, but the lack of knowledge and respect for customers tops it off. Strongly recommend Chase. Steer clear of this BOA location and the institution all together.

AZ88 is probably my favorite restaurant/bar. The food is decently priced, the martinis are literally the BEST and the atmosphere is so welcoming! The bartenders are always friendly and the wait staff is always helpful and fun! I make it a point to come in at least once a month to see if there is a new art display up! Check it out! Try the lemon drop
