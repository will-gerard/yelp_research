Do not ever come or stay at this hospital! They charge for valet four dollars and charge a dollar to park in the garage. I don't care if it's $.50 a dollar or four dollars .... I have never known any hospital in all of Phoenix or Scottsdale to charge the people who come to visit the people in the hospital money to park their car while they are staying there, their valet is always complementary. Downright obnoxious and it should be against the law. Rant over.

There are open again. Tried to check in but Yelp wouldn't let me. Sad to say they don't have their famous black berry lemonade anymore.

I love this place! Came here about a year ago through groupon and now I've been coming every month since! Best female masseuses ever. I can't speak for the males, but I'm sure they're fantastic too. I would definitely recommend N8 Touch to anyone in the valley who wants to get a massage.

Man oh man what can I say. First of all, reading all these negative reviews makes me so sad! I absolutely love this place and adore the owners and Ace, the sushi chef, he is incredible! I have been coming to Kokoro for the last year practically every Wednesday for lunch and I have never been let down! Every person I bring with me or suggest to come on their own would agree with me. The food is always fresh, service is timely, I'm always greeted by a friendly face, and their restaurant is always clean. I always look forward to my Wednesday lunch date with Kokoro's sushi. I usually order Edamame, the Las Vegas Roll, and the Caterpillar Roll. When my friend comes with me she usually orders the Honey Sesame Chicken or the Teriyaki Chicken. Both of our meals are a hardy helping and we are both satisfied and full when we leave. I can't tell you how obsessed I am with their Las Vegas Roll. I consider myself a sushi connoisseur of sorts. I've lived in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area for 10 years now and have tried many sushi spots. Kokoro, hands down, has the best Las Vegas Roll in the valley. I will continue to recommend Kokoro sushi as one of the best places to get sushi in the Phoenix area!

So my boyfriend saw this place listed on groupon and it was a great deal so he bought it.   He got the red wine flight and I got the white. I definitely enjoyed the white wines better but... The white wines are paired with a champagne and the red wines are paired with a port. By far my favorite was the port but I have a different taste than most. Love those sweet desert wines/drinks. But overall all the wines were great.   The food... Oh my gosh... Delicious! We ordered the grilled cheese bites, cheese board, hummus, and a bruschetta. All items were reasonably priced and the portions were perfect.   The wait staff was pleasant and eager to our needs. Love the feel of the restaurant, great ambience. Loved the lighting with the mini candles and corks. Cute twist. Can't wait to go back.

Courtney has been my hair dresser for the last 4 years but has been doing hair for over 10 years. She cuts, colors, and styles my hair regularly. She just got done coloring my hair bring pink in fact, a pink ombr√©. It looks great.  Courtney is also my makeup artist. She has accompanied me to photo shoots and prepares me for various events when needed.   I couldn't speak more highly of any other hair stylist. She's a great person too, fun to talk with. She's very easy going and is willing to drive any where for a hair or makeup client.  If you decide to go with Courtney Ness you won't go wrong. I highly recommend her.

Went by just now planning to eat there before my movie and they're closed for renovations per the theatre. Anyways, would have been nice if someone from management had reported that to Yelp.
