I actually had this saved as a draft and was going to say something nice. Unfortunately I have been back to this location a couple of times since the new management and I don't think I will be going ever again. Service goes a long way, so I will say the food was great, but the service was unacceptable!

So..   My favorite east valley eatery does it AGAIN! This time the awesomeness came in the form of "The Club" sandwich. Perfectly executed with crispy bacon and lightly toasted sourdough.   Bravo!  Trust me people this place is LEGIT! Another favorite is their Sunday brunch from 10-2 on Sundays and their all you can eat fish fry on Fridays.   Get in your car, get to chandler and get to Pecan Grove!

If you're pre or post workout and you're looking to get educated on what your body needs to reach its goals, then you definitely need to check out Kiwi Juice bar. The staff is friendly and extremely knowledgable. They make you feel like old friends.   Not only do I frequently enjoy my post workout recovery smoothie; (Java Jolt with chocolate almond milk, Glutamine, and a scoop of espresso beans) but the staff actually showed me the benefits of adding a pre-workout drink to my workout. I was able to buy everything there!   Saddens me that 5 stars is the max, because Kiwi Juice Bar deserves a 10 diamond rating.   - Leo

Absolutely AMAZNG! From some primo steaks, to exotics and even jumbo Chicago style Vienna hot dogs! Live near 5 grocery stores and in the month since I've discovered this place I haven't gone ANYWHERE ELSE for meat and chicken. This place is exceptional!
