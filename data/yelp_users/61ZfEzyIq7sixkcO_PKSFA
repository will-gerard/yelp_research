I have never felt more comfortable really anywhere but my own home as I felt here. These people are kind and helpful. Dr Manning makes you feel like you have known him your whole life. Tried any way he could to save me money - even offered coming in at 6am just to get my procedure done around my schedule. Real stand up guy. I loved it here so much I told my "ex-dentist" he should use Dr. Manning for his personal dental needs  if I could leave ten stars I would.

Went in for breakfast.. Wasn't very busy 2 servers working all tables.. Ordered our food and coffee.. 20 min later food called for both servers tables (Us and another table that arrived the same time we did).   I'm in the restaurant/customer service industry.. And this last part is what gets me.. The other waitress took the other tables food right to them when she was called.. Our food sat as our waitress was talking and walking around.. Now running a restaurant is a team effort.. And if you see food sitting, regardless if its your table or not RUN THE FOOD, Don't let it sit for 15 min and look at us 4 times and not say anything to the other waitress.. I'm not eating cold food.. I paid for the coffee that was never refilled and walked out.. Will not be back.. Which is unfortunate is they are the new owners of Frank Food Truck and it's a small business..

Honest guys doing honest work. I own and operate a gourmet food truck in the valley and these guys are the ONLY people I trust to touch my truck. They will do all they can and they will always be honest and open with you about their work. Love big b
