Velocity Fulfillment is anything but. They were contracted to handle rebates from Cooler Master, for which after 2.5 months I'm still waiting to receive my rebate check.  VF has a website (status-now.com) on which you can check the status of a rebate. A month ago, the status updated to say that my submission was processed and the response was mailed. If I didn't receive it by the middle of November, there was a number I could call.  As of today, I've still received nothing, so I called. Their call system is a joke. The system told me that I was caller 2, put me on hold with elevator music for a minute, and then the music suddenly cut out. For 12 minutes, there was complete silence. During this time, I wasn't even sure that I was still connected. Maybe my call got dumped into the void?  Finally, I heard something. It was the welcome message being played again. Then, the system happily announced, "You are caller.... 5".  I hung up.  So much for the "Rapid Response Call Center" that they boast about on their site.

In my previous review, I mentioned experiencing rebate delays and a phone system glitch with Velocity Fulfillment. I'm happy to say that within a day (wow) of me posting my original review, Greg, a high-level investor in the company, personally contacted me through Yelp and offered his apologies.  He agreed that I should've received a check in the mail by now, and offered to have a check overnighted to me. He was sympathetic to my concerns and not pushy. He really did seem to care about righting a wrong.  I'm always impressed when a business looks at (honest) negative feedback, takes that constructively and tries to make amends, and uses that experience to do better in the future. That does seem to be the case with Velocity, after all.  Followup: Looks like the check came as promised!
