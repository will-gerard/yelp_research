Manuel's is our standby Mexican food restaurant in the Valley, due to its reasonable prices, friendly service, and consistently good food. Over the course of 8 or so years, we've gone to Manuel's and never gone away wishing we had gone somewhere else.  The portion sizes are great for the price. And the chips & salsa they bring when you're seated is quite good. You would think that would be easy, but so many Mexican restaurants bring you watered down salsa for you to dip their greasy chips in. Not here!

My wife and I decided to have a date night for the first time in a really, really long time. We settled on trying Flemings and we were delighted that we did.  The waitress we had was excellent. Was always there when we needed her, and nowhere to be seen when we didn't--a good thing! The food was excellent, to say the least.  When the manager stopped by our table about halfway through our meal, she asked what the occasion was. We explained that with our son needing so much attention, we don't get to go out much. Since I ordered the 4-course meal, I got dessert. To our surprise though, they brought my wife a dessert (the lava cake) as well - with the explanation that "if we don't get to go out much, they wanted it to be special." A nice touch!  Usually we find that most restaurants have trade-offs. Great food but bad service, or great service but bad atmosphere, etc. With Flemings, we found no trade-offs. We will return.

I'm shocked at the amount of stars being used to rate this place. I would give it no stars if I could.  My wife, son and I just tried the place, and I was the only one who got any food. After ordering a hamburger for my son, we were brought a cheeseburger - which he cannot eat. When they finally brought out the hamburger some time later, the fries were cold enough to tell me they left the original fries on the plate while they cooked a new hamburger and didn't even bother to keep them under a heat lamp.  My wife never did get her food - as by then I had finished my $11 chimichanga that was microwaved (a fact anyone could determine by the scorching hot outside and still cold inside) tiny little thing in the middle of the plate. Honestly, $11 for something the size of a hot pocket, covered in dried out lettuce is just insulting. Both the refried beans and the rice were bland - completely void of any seasoning at all.  I should have known what we were in for when I saw the grease-soaked chips brought to us when we sat down.

The yogurt is spectacular, and most toppings are great too (I would stay away from the fruit if you're looking for something fresh). But other than that, it beats everything on a hot Phoenix day.  I like this location in particular because it's always kept clean, there's generally not a long line, and the kids working there always seem pleasant.
