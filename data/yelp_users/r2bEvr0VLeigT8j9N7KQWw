Let start by saying horrible customer service for being the only ones in there. The lady was very uninterested in taking our order and I brought my mother here who is visiting out of town to get breakfast. So glad I didn't order anything and give this establishment my money because, her little "hole in the wall" shop doesn't deserve my money I worked hard for. *Drops mic*

Let me start by saying I've been going to Zealous hair lounge 9 years and every visit is better than the previous. Meka is very professional, knows her business and is an amazing hair artist! I would recommend her 100 times over. You definately will leave feeling more beautiful!! Thank you Meka!!!
