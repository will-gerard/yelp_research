Guanaquito's was a place my GF found out about through someone at work, and she dragged me along. I was skeptical, but optimistic. I have lived in Panama and Guatemala, and I was looking forward to some basic C.A. farmer food.  I was not disappointed. My stewed chicken was excellent. We ordered an appetizer platter: starch as far as the eye could see. They even had yucitas (casava fries). In Panama, we joked  about yuca being the potato's drier, stringier cousin. But Guanaquito's yucitas brought back fond memories of the campo and drunken evenings sitting in Pio Pio in David. A mixed message for most, I'm sure, but for me it was all good.  The staff was awesome, explaining for us gringos how to enjoy the fare. And we did enjoy. I'm looking forward to making my way back sometime soon.

The pizza here is top shelf. My brother actually slings the pies at LGO on the weekends, so I'm a little biased. If you're feeling adventurous, ask him to throw an egg or two on your pizza. It takes a little longer, but it adds an awesome little extra protein fix.

I have mixed feelings about REI. I used to sell outdoor gear for Popular Outdoor Outfitters (now defunct). When we didn't carry something a customer was looking for, which wasn't often, we sent them to REI.    REI is the destination in the valley for high-end outdoor gear. However, their prices reflect this. I really like the REI store-brand gear. It's durable and the price point is pretty good. Anything else in the store, however, has a larger mark-up than you would find elsewhere. If you're looking for something you could buy elsewhere without trying it on, shop around online for a better deal.   Their dividend program is nice, though. REI is technically a co-op, meaning you can pay a one-time fee (20$ nowadays) and sign up for the dividend program. You receive some percentage of your purchases back as a dividend to spend in the store. They also have a Visa card which lets all of your purchases feed into your yearly dividend at a lower percentage. They issue dividends in the spring, just in time to get geared up for the new season.  New info: I was digging through my dividend packet, and it turns out you can actually get your dividend in cash. See the store for details.

Hyundai of Tempe is great folks. They walked me through my first car-buying experience. I managed to get a pretty good price on a nice ride. (Who knew you can still get a decent car for less than 10 grand?) The sales manager (Vic) cut me a deal because I was ex-Peace Corps. They have free hot dogs and soda. All in all, it was a pleasant  experience.

The MAC rocks! It is a fully modern arts venue with great architecture and 4 (count 'em) four performing arts spaces. I've seen three shows at MAC  and I've had a great time, every time. Add to this the fine arts education center and the museum (which I have yet to visit).   The Store, as they call the gift shop, is full of the regularly gallery store crap. But it also has handmade ceramic, glass and jewelry pieces created by students in the education program. All are affordable, and some of the pieces are actually really good. Check it out next time you need a cool gift.

This is an OK Goodwill (I've been to a few). Their selection of housewares is pretty good. This place's proximity to ASU would seem to make it a natural haunt for students on a shoestring. But then, this is Scottsdale we're talking about, and most of the people in here are la gente trabajador. I give it only four stars because the selection of men's clothing is severely limited. The staff members I've interacted with have been pleasant. And, most importantly, every other Saturday everything in the store is half-off.

OK, I've only been once. The GF and I were in search of a happy hour in the area.  Flicka's was a huge disappointment!!! They didn't have any food specials on the day we went, and the drink specials were limited to domestic beers. Ugh! Maybe it's livelier at night, but our afternoon experience was bad. The food was bland bar food, and the nachos had already started to cool and congeal by the time they arrived at our table. Big disappointment.

The GF and I were headed out of town for a weekend at Lake Roosevelt to do some canyoning. We dropped our pups off on Friday afternoon after the "check-in" time (3PM) with the understanding that "check-out" time is 12 noon daily. We were planning on picking up our fuzzy, four-legged children on Sunday before noon.   We camped out Friday night, did our canyon run on Saturday, and decided to head back to town Saturday night for a soft bed and a puppy-free evening. Come Sunday morning, happy and relaxed, we find out that Scottsdale Pet Hotel does not open for pick-ups or drop-offs on Sunday until 3 PM (their check-out time). So the dogs were held for that much longer, and we were charged another night for picking up after the check-out time. My GF was, to say the least, a little miffed by this loophole which they use to ream Sunday customers.  The place smelled of dogs (as to be expected). It's impossible to know if they had the outdoor play time for which we were charged extra.  In their defense, the service was friendly and the pups did not appear mistreated. Overall, though, Scottsdale Pet Hotel is not a sparkling gem in the local pet-care industry.

My buddies and I get together for Sunday lunch, and we've eaten at Serrano's more than we should. As most Italian food joints fill you with bread, Serrano's fills you with their addictive, creamy refried bean dip and chips.  If' you're feeling cheap, order a bowl of pozole (pretty tasty) and then get your fill on the chips and dips. If you're just ordering a burrito and a soda, you might get out under 10 bucks.Their grilled meat dishes are the best things on the menu, but, of course, also the most expensive. The margaritas are delicious (though I'm pretty easy to please here) .   My only complaint (and this mostly applies to the Dobson/Guadalupe location) is the service. It is generally slow, and groups seem the intimidate the 16 year-old servers working here. The Rural location has better service, however, and a nicer bar.

I made it out there by my lonesome yesterday. WICKED COOL! The drumming was amazing, the swordsmanship was cool, and the guy sculpting with wax was pretty neat. There was a large contingent of anime cos-players out, and it was fun to see all the costumes. And check out the Buddhist Temple's stand for some of the best yakisoba in town.

OK. First...I frickin love peanut butter. Not just because its a tasty treat. Not because the taste stays with you for at least 15 minutes as you lick it off the roof of your mouth. No, I don't even love it because of its special places in American history (George Washington Carver, Jimmy Carter, anyone?)  I love the old PB for one simple reason: It was damned-near my only source of protein for 18 months of my life. Peace Corps taught me that sometimes meat is hard to get, the chickens aren't always laying, and beans aren't always in season. So what was a man to do? Well, after I was tired of chicken feet and beef tripe, I rediscovered peanut butter. It's calorie rich. It travels pretty well. And praise the lord, you don't have to refrigerate it!!!  Pretty soon, I was throwing PB in my rice, and I'll be damned if it wasn't the best ghetto Thai food I've ever tasted. And when I moved to a bigger town, and bought a second-hand fridge, I kept up my peanut butter habit. That habit has stayed with me to this day. While I don't eat rice quite so often anymore, I still like a big glob of PB in my oatmeal.  That being said, PB Loco was to me like an Italian cobbler's shop to a Scottsdale fashionista: so many opportunities for exquisiteness. My GF and I did the sampler and I indulged in three fantastic ways to dress up the old crema de mani. The sandwiches looked so-so, but the sampler was a pretty good way to experience the new wonderfulness. And I even walked away with two jars.  Oh, and the staff was courteous if disinterested. The design was OK; seems more aimed at kiddo's than adults. I'm going to go back for the savory flavors; I think there is some great cooking possibilities in the curry and sun-dried tomato varieties.

Their frozen drinks carried me through last summer. They have free air (for your tires) and water (for the radiator) at every location I've ever been to. Their hot sandwiches, though greasy, aren't TOO greasy and actually taste like food. The coffee is pretty good, and they have more ways to tart it up than Starbucks does. QT frickin' rocks.  And BTW, the QT stands for Quick Trip.

I'm a DIY kinda guy. I like working on my car. I like fixing up the house. I enjoy these things not because (like so many hipsters) I think its cute or cool. I fix things because I'm cheap, and I think things should last. The awesome thing about Harbor Freight is that they sell tools that are cheap and that last. They have almost any kind of air tool or power tool you could need, plus enough hand tools to build an arc or repair a aircraft carrier. My only qualms are that they don't have fittings for PVC and the lack of a lumber yard.

Sports Chalet is the most complete sporting goods and outdoor store I have ever seen. They have a vast selection of sports equipment and exercise gear. Their Mountain Shop has a very good selection of climbing and camping gear. Although the gear section is not as extensive as REI, the prices are slightly better. And they do SCUBA.   I took my PADI course through a dive shop before I found out about Sport's Chalet's prices. They are FAR less expensive than any dive shop in the valley when it comes to the PADI open water certification courses and dives. The dive instructor at the Tempe store, Dan, leads the dive classes and is highly competent. (I give the dive program five stars).
