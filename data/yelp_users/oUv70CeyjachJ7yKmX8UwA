These guys are clearly uneducated and mix currency's by different countries in different continents! They didn't know how to exchange currency, when I always do it at different chains. I don't recommend this place there's one down the road that must be better..

I'm guessing this place is under new management, I've been going to this place for quite some time and now they are the nearest dry cleaners around my neighborhood. The new owners are always happy to see me and always hook me up with specials and discounts they are fast and reliable. They know I'm lazy and I don't to my own laundry so when I show up with a big bag of fluff and fold they make jokes that make me laugh and and take good care of me all the time. The best part is that they are cheep for being in the Scottsdale region!
