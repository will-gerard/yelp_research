We usually call in to go ordrs as we did today. Speaker for pickup doesnt work, u just have to hope they see u on camera or youll be waiting.. hannah had wrong price so i couldnt contact on speaker- had to run in cause i forgot my cell. They gave me correct price, and my order. I get back to my van n check my bags. Hannah had forgotten half my ordr. No cheese crisp, xtra chips n salsa, and my entire carne asada chimi meal with rice and beans were no where to be found. So now, im making my second trip in cause again, speaker doesnt work. Mind u, hannah has only been out to my vehicle once and that was to get my name for my order and my credit card. I had already given her a $10 tip for my $37 order when i paid.  AND ive gone in and out twice cause she didnt properly check my bags. I shoulda asked her for change since i paid her tip cash. By the time i got back to my vehicle, my initial food brought out first was cold. Hub and I, as much as we like the food, have now sworn off this place for good. Customr service on to go is zero stars the only reason for two stars is the cooks know what theyre doing. Let me make a point of saying I always tip good rght away and normally this gets me good srvice. I pay cash tip even if i use cc just so i know they get it right away, and recognize it...like i said, they appreciate the consideration normally and i get good service.  I'll know better next time i guess. I checked my bags, i made sure ordr and pricng on receipt was correct, i did all the legwork...shoulda tipped myself!

Been coming here since i was 7 and im about to be 29. Theyve hardly ever messed up my order- I cant even think of once actually. Melanie is best in the drive thru, shes always really friendly and sweet.. must not be an az native! =)  Ive seen her like triple check my bag before- so shes really thurough. I usually dont go in to eat- havent in years since it was the go to munchie place when i was a teen. So I cant really comment on inside...but the drive thru has never been an issue - that and the food is consistent and good!

Very customer friendly. My inlaws have gone through LEE for years, then for my husband and his sister, and now Im going there too.  He usually has some of the best prices, and unlike most places, they do the glasses in store! You might have to wait a couple hours or a day, but no where near the waiting time if you were to go to a place like Nationwide Vision who I used to go to.  They are very knowledgeable and are concerned about what you need.

Awesome and quick delivery. Used them for years and cant recall EVER having any issues.  Traffic may suck for pickup because its right across from glendale community college and next door to a overcrowded and run down circle k. Opt for the delivery if u can. Worth it n quick!

They get a two only cause their pizza and wings are awesome.  Their prices are bad for some things-good on others.  I paid $5 for an order of calamari.  8 circular pieces, but no pieces with legs or anything.  They were hard on outside but pure rubber on the inside.  I get calamari literally anywhere I can... I love it normally- but would not waste money buying it here.  Neither my order of breads ticks or calamari came with marinara.  NO  SAUCE.  Only got Ranch for my wings.  I ordered at 4:40pm and they said they'd be here in less than an hour.  An hour and a half later- I was dialing the pizza place to see where my food was at as they pulled up.  I tipped $10 cause I'm on their delivery border but had I not been far- I would've docked tip.  FYI I tip extra for early.  My last delivery from hungry Howie was twenty min early- he got a $15 tip from me.  We just wanted something different so we ordered rosati's.         I have picked up from this location as well before and ended up waiting 20-30 min passed the time they gave me in the restaurant... Watching others eat.  The have me a free extra order of 6 wings for my wait... But that seems to be the main issue they have consistently.. Timing.  So- skip the calamari - make sure u get your sauces and expect a wait.  Pizza and wings are complaint free

We ordered take out. They were here within a timely manner. My egg rolls were ok...just tasted old.   The sweet and sour sauce was the worst. I LOVE chinese and love sweet and sour sauce. First off, it smelled like sweet and sour sauce mixed with puke. I'm not kidding. I wouldnt say that to be mean, it is LITERALLY what it smelled like. We liked the crab puffs...just didnt have anything GOOD to dip them in. We both ordered teriyaki combo plates, and pork fried rice as well. Rice was ok...not much flavor. Hub never even got to his teriyaki last night....bad thing is, I did. I had probably about 5 bites before I put it in the fridge for tomorrow. It was the only thing I ate that hub didnt. I was up ALL NIGHT long in the bathroom. Sick as a dog. The teriyaki meals are still in my fridge and I plan to call about it.  ( JUST CALLED THE PLACE) spoke with the manager. I asked for a refund on just my two meals that wouldve totalled less that $15.  My order including tip- I even tipped 8 dollars!- was $38.   I've lived in peoria all 28 years of my life, and order from this place quite frequently. I have never asked for a refund or complained before. Usually they are our GO TO for chinese take out.  Guy said no, beccause people can eat, get full,and then call for refund.    ONe of my meals had like 5 bites taken out of it (that's what got me sick) and hub didnt even touch his yet, he put it in the fridge and was saving it for today......SO I OFFERED to take the food back to them.  He said no again. I asked for higher up and than him and he said there was no higher....just the owner. I asked for the owner's info or to give him my info for contact and he refused!  He said the owner would think it was silly and would laugh at him for not being able to handle it.   I said, ok, then why isnt this handled?   He again refused to take my info and then hung up on me.   I told him I write reviews and would post to the BBB- I wanted to speak with the owner. Im not some cheapy trying to get my money back.  I have a house, two vehicles, and a small business. $15 isnt anything but principal at this point. Your food made someone sick.  I didnt ask for a full refund and I tipped MORE than what is adequate.  I WAS a good customer and now they have lost our business.            Today is mother's day. Last night we ordered take out cause my inlaws just took the kids for the night. It was my relax night....and I ended up in the bathroom all night long- and feeling like crap this morning.     My review and issue is on to the BBB next, and any place else I can post about it.    It's just not right!

I love this place! Their subs are awesome.. soo much better than subway. Ingredients r fresh n prices r comparable.  I love going here and supporting a small local business. Him and his wife own and run the shop- small mom and pop op.   They have a punch card too which is better than subway. Ive had the gatti which is good but a lil strong to me. We usually get the turkey ham and bacon. The only reason this isnt five star is cause they really need to work on how their menu is presented. Wayyy easier to look at flyer than it all bunched up on those dry erase boards. The first time i went in, it took a while for me to read and decifer bunched up writing and pricing.  Regardless, service and subs r top notch!

We ordered online. Quick n easy. It says they dont deliver n Im like 2 miles away litrrally. So where do they deliver cause im right in between two locations? Anyhow, that would be my ONLY complaint. Food is awesome. Just enough of everything..nothing overdone. We got two gargantuans for hub n i and the kids each got a slim. Paid around $30 for 4 subs which is more than other places. We usually do gatti's down the road...we just were wanting to try something different. Ill still probably stick to gattis for my usual place cause they have more variety..but this is nice- different- for every now n then... another instance where delivering would encourage more orders...
