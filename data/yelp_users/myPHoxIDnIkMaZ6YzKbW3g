Best salsa in town, I've been eating here for 10 years and I always order #34 chicken melt- there was a time where they started cooking it a weird way so I stopped going, but just recently started going back and they went back to their old ways so Im excited to be eating at my favorite restaurant

I go to Mcfall for EVERYTHING!!! I have gone to many auto repair places and these are the only guys I would EVER trust, they are good honest people and that's really hard to find now-a-days, and totally affordable! I have many good experiences with them, they have gotten me out of a lot of jams with my truck, but I've had my truck for 6 years and its still going strong thanks to the guys at McFall tire!!!

I have been to a million different dentists, every time I go I have horrible experiences. The last place I went to left me in the waiting room for 45 minutes just to tell me they couldn't see me because the hygienist was not going to be in the office that day! I understand not being able to see me, but it shouldn't take you 45 minutes to tell me. The time before that they burned my skin and tried to tell me it was because I'm allergic to latex.... I have never been allergic to latex, nor am I at this moment. My last dentist told me cavities were forming and I need to get fillings and many other things. So after that last appointment I swore to never use them again (western dental-DON'T go there) I looked online at my dental insurance to see which office I could go to, and reel dentist was down the street from my house so I decided to go with them, plus I read reviews on their facebook/yelp/google and they were all positive so I decided to try them. IT WAS SO WORTH IT!!! I didn't have to wait long at all, they had a cute movie playing when I was waiting and the staff is super nice! I highly recommend everybody use them. They keep you well informed about what is going on with your teeth and they do a great job cleaning! I don't remember the last time I was able to trust a dentist and I finally found a dentist that doesn't lie to me or try to do things to my teeth that doesn't need to be done. I'm really glad I found this office, I won't be going anywhere else! Five Stars!!!

The hotel was beautiful, I was getting married at the quad and my parents booked us the room at the trump, they upgraded the room at no charge because we were getting married and we also received a complimentary bottle of wine. When I first walked in the staff was so friendly and answered every question I had. I also brought my dog with me and he received some free things as well. We walk our dog three times a day, and they have a convenient places to walk him outside. When we were settled in we took the free shuttle to ceasers palace and walked up and down the strip. They also have a shuttle that goes to the wynn, and they both pick up and take you to those two hotels, which is nice so you don't have to pay for a taxi. The room was incredible! I was having my pre-wedding pictures done of me getting ready in the bathroom so my concern for the room we got was the bathroom and they exceeded my standards! I was so impressed with how beautiful the bathroom looked! This hotel was amazing and so was everybody that worked there!!!

Was super good, went for happy hour and ate three rolls under $20! And the rolls were extremely good, the murphy roll was my favorite, I also had the salmon roll and the vegas rolls, the vegas roll was a little different that Im use to but it was still really good

Kabuki has THE BEST SUSHI in Arizona, my fiancé HATES sushi but I took him to kabuki and he loved it, they are normally always busy so service isn't that great, everytime I go there it takes forever to get the check, or a refill on a drink, every now and then its not too bad but normally the service isn't that great. The portions are good size, I normally go during happy hour to get cheap sushi, but the sushi rolls are huge! LOVE IT!! And its all fresh, so if your looking for a place to eat sushi where you wont end up getting sick-this is the place to go!!!

I definitely do no recommend this place, the dentist said I needed fillings because I had cavities forming, so I said okay fine when could I have it done and he said it would be an all-day thing and I can schedule it in a few weeks- which was fine I could live with that... the part that pissed me off was that he eventually decided to tell me that I couldn't be seen that day because the hygienist was out of the office. I would have been okay with that but I waited 45 FREAKING MINUTES for him to tell me that I was there for nothing? Are you serious? I'm one of those people that have a job that's really hard to get away from, so not being able to be seen the day I was supposed to be seen was very frustrating- I understand things happen, but don't leave your patients in the waiting room for 45 minutes just to tell them they can't be seen! The kicker is- I decided to try a new Dentist, who my family has been using for years, she told me I HAD NO CAVATIES WHATSOEVER!!! So those assholes at western dental apparently just wanted my money... don't go there- they ALWAYS have a long wait time and all they are after is your money

The three times I've gone here I've gotten falsely diagnosed or given the improper care, the last time I went they called me and told me I needed to go to the hospital because my white blood cell count was high, they made me feel like if I didn't go I could die, so I went and nothing was wrong with me, I now have a $1200 hospital bill AND the bill from them, definitely NEVER coming back

I refuse to ever go to this chipotle again, the staff is unprofessional-probably because they all look and act like 5 year olds. Everytime I go its normally right before they close and its PACKED, yet they won't serve anymore guacamole or bell peppers or anything else if they are out (they have more in the back) horrible customer service! I'd rather spend my money elsewhere

A great place to go if you're in your 20's, I went with my husband and the food was over the top awesome!  And it was a fun atmosphere, it was really loud so its not a place I would take my parents, but I enjoyed my experience

I hardly ever get to go out because I have a crazy schedule, so me and some friends decided to go to whiskey rose to try it out at westgate, the bartender was HORRIBLE!!! I shouldn't have to wait as long as I did for a drink, especially because it was a Sunday night and it was there were 20 people in there tops... Not to mention the drinks were horrible, I felt that she wasn't putting any alcohol in them, I had 3 margaritas and not even a buzz!!! Thank you for, we ended up leaving and going to toby keiths... my friends and I wont be coming back-not worth my money, me and my fiancé are really understanding people but the dumb blonde behind the bar needs to find a new profession because bartending just isn't working for her.  If I could give no stars I would

I have lived at these apartments for nine months, for how many rules there are I still feel like im living with my parents. The other day I was moving something and had some heavy stuff in my hand so I set it down on the side walk and proceeded to take half of It to my truck, as I turned around to get the rest, an employee showing someone around looks at me and says (you need to move this off the sidewalk) well no shit Sherlock! The stuff was there for not even a minute!  The pool used to be open 24/7 (which is why we moved here) but thanks to some dumb kids they now have it closed at 10pm so if you get off late and want to go for a swim-good luck with that. They also do not allow any parties at the pool, so no bringing your guests to the pool. And those security doors they have didn't work half the time I've been here, and now that they do work- someone always has a rock to prop them open so they open most of the day. I complained about this and they said it was only when there was tenants moving out and the people working on the vacant apartment didn't have a key to the complex so they propped the door open. If you ever want to rent the clubhouse, expect to pay $150 plus a $500 deposit (which you get back) and it only holds up to 30 people...not worth it no matter how nice it is. My rent was $775 but after all the hidden fees its $850 which is fine but I wasn't expecting it to be that much for a one bedroom. DO NOT get a room on the bottom or second floor, you can hear EVERYTHING that is dropped or people running/walking down the hall. The BBQ's are great, best thing about the place, just every now and then they run out of propane which sucks when you prepare your food then head out to the grill to find out it has no propane. Lately I'm also beginning to get the feeling the place isn't kid friendly, so if you're single uptight person without a family this is probably a good fit. The apartment has the nicest maintenance staff, the guys are super nice and knowledgeable and do a great job at repairing problems. But the apartments aren't worth their price, you might as well as find a house to rent. I'm not renewing my lease, instead I found a house to rent for $850.

I had a bachelorette party at the tempe locations- best investment ever! Customer service was awesome, drinks were always full and we got to dance the night away, if you are planning any sort of party plan it here- im not much of a party person but I will definitely be going back again!

We were just charged for the bachelorette party that we had 2 months ago, I understand that we owed the money, but after 2 months  you tend to forget that the money was never taken out, I just assumed it was taken out the night of the party. I won't ever go back to whiskey rose, I'd rather go to a bar that will bill me within a decent amount of time, not two fucking months later!
