Great local authentic Mexican food! Brought a couple out-of-towners to this place and said that it was amazing, and they definitely agreed. An easy way to tell that a Mexican food restaurant is going to be good is by their beans, rice, and tortillas. All 3 were awesome. Long waits in line, but definitely worth the wait.

Great shop! Every employee I talked to knew their stuff. Not only where they informative, but they were all so chill. Everyone seemed happy to answer any questions you had, and always made some good recommendations. If you're in Tempe and don't know when to find a good smoke shop, find these guys.  P.S. If Ashley is assisting you the day you get there, give her a high five! She's knows what she's talking about, and was extremely helpful.

This place has some bomb late night pizza. My spot every time I come out to Tempe to drink.

So....gave this place 3 chances. They worked with me and gave us a free car wash after they messed up the first time. So that's much appreciated. We brought it back in to get re-done, and they still did a horrible job. Looks like they just wiped it down with a wet towel. It wasn't until the last time bringing it in the they did a decent job, and that was because I was standing there. Told them after the last chance that I wasn't coming back in again. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.

OMG. this place has amazing donuts. I've been going to them since I moved to Litchfield. The couple that owns the place are cool and they always seem happy to do what they do! Would recommend to anyone who is in need of donuts in the Avondale area! BOOM!
