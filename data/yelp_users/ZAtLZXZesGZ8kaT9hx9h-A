After receiving a HUGE box of Huggies diapers size 4 at my baby shower, I was thankful to the gift giver. It wasn't until my daughter outgrew size 4's and I went into the storage closet to see the box of unused diapers, I freaked!! So I went to BBRus to exchange the size from a box of 4's to a box of 5's and they wouldn't allow me to exchange because it was over the 90 day "return window." I wasn't trying to get money from them, I wasn't trying to exchange it for something completely different...I only wanted to exhange sizes. After some back and forth with the cashier, I asked what he thought I should do with a 220-ct. box of diapers that I can't use and his response was, "I don't know, give it to a friend." He wasn't trying to be understanding and they couldn't just exchange a size. Walmart and Target are VERY accomodating for returns/exchanges. I also feel like I'm always jumping through hoops to try and use a coupon from them. They have SO MANY exclusions: Diapers, wipes, strollers, cribs, formula, carseats, bedding, anything your baby may need in it's life span. You can use the coupon basically on a tub of "baby puffs." I feel like I waste so much time there when I'm looking for items on the registry for friends, because items are always scattered, discontinued, or wrong. (i.e. Pink pacifiers for my friend who is having a baby boy.) It's possible that they could have made that mistake, but who doesn't go look at their registry online once it's created?? She would have noticed pink pacifiers on there. I had another friend who said that BBRUs would add crap to their registry, and delete stuff as well. It's almost never busy there, however I find myself waiting for staff members to help me either find something, or check out. Someone stated in a previous post that they waited 10 minutes for a cashier to come, and I really feel like I am always waiting as well for someone to come over and check me out. I refuse to have a baby registry here, and I cringe everytime I have to go here to get an item off of a friend/family member's registry!

In the years past, my family has given my husband and I gift cards to Claim Jumper for anniversary gifts, Christmas, birthdays, etc. They knew how much we LOVED this restaurant. (Notice the past tense for 'love.') We went to eat there tonight to celebrate our anniversary, and it was a complete shock. CJ used to be one of our favorite restaurants. Tonight, we experienced mediocre, overpriced food and SLOOOW service. Don't get me wrong, our waitress was really nice...just probably very busy with the other 2 tables she had in her area. The restaurant was barely full (there usually was a gaggle of people on a waiting list eager to eat there), and there was a lot of staff members standing around idle. I don't know if they are under new management, but the menu has changed, and quality of food is sub-par, and the service was slow. Needless to say, the word has been spread amongst my family NOT to get us anymore giftcards to CJ.

I've had a water softener and an RO System in my house for the last 4 years. American Home Water was the one who installed it and have only had to come out to deliver salt bags to us! We have had no problems with our equipment in the last 4 years, the prices are very reasonable, and they are very quick to get back to you and are always considerate of your time and work around your schedule. Like another reviewer said, they were honest and upfront and didn't try to "up sell" me on anything. They were very knowledgable of their systems, and were very friendly when they came. I couldn't have asked for a better experience, and I would highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for a water softener or RO system!

I was shopping at Kirklands today, and the cashier made my day! He was funny, witty, and very personable. Not only that, but he saw the coupon I had and knew that the store was offering a better one, and let me use it! He made it a great experience and I got some cute things to decorate for fall! I can't wait! I love the unique things you can buy, and how cheap they are compared to other home good stores!

What I don't understand, is how there haven't been any changes in quality of service after YEARS of bad reviews of this location. This McDonald's location is the only one I avoid. Service is ALWAYS slow, and there's a 98% chance that your order will be wrong. I have 3 little ones, and they love going to McD's as a treat every now and then. I will drive them to a different McD's that's out of my way, just to avoid the annoyance and frustration I feel going to this location. I feel like the staff even thinks it's a joke to keep customers waiting. There's never a sense of urgency, or even an apology when you've been waiting in line 10 minutes for a Diet Coke. You would think after all these horrible reviews, they would try and find a new manager and staff. Disappointing.

I came in with my 1 year old and 3 year old daughter, who were both very antsy and hungry. Gory was the woman who served us, and she was very fast and efficient with her work. She talked to my girls, and was extremely friendly. What could have been an overwhelming experience with my 2 young girls, ended up being a great one! We'll definitely be back to visit again!

My husband and I ate here last night for our "date night," and we have no regrets choosing The Haymaker! I got the BLAT sandwich, (which was delicious, by the way) and he got the ribs/chicken plate (I can't remember the name on the menu, but it was also VERY good!) His came with baked mac'n'cheese and mine with sweet potato fries. We were 100% satisfied with our food, and after ordering the bread pudding for dessert we were stuffed to the brim. It was great food for a great price, and we definitely plan on returning!

Yummy, delicious donuts, and friendly staff. We've only eaten at Donutsville a handful of times, but they are always friendly and their donuts are always fresh. What I'm most impressed with is their catering capabilities. We did a "Donut Breakfast at the Park" for my daughters 2nd birthday, they provided dozens of donuts along with jugs of coffee. The coffee was delicious, was held in a container that kept it warm in the cold breeze, and provided the cups, stirrers, and creamers to go with it. All for a decent/competitive price! I highly recommend trying them out!
