Some places are old because they are cool. MacAlpine's is cool because it is old.  It smells like your Grandmother's house (some people find this endearing. Really? Musty is chic now?). Food is extra medium. We went with a group of a dozen (none of whom had been there) and no one raved about their entree.  I'm docking a star for having a broken air conditioner (during the hottest week in Phoenix August history) --- our shakes & ice creams went melty fast. Also... they close at 7. Just because it smells like my Grandmother's house doesn't mean it should go to bed when she does.  Stars for great service, lots of things to look at and a bajillion choices of Italian sodas. Plus it's old. 1928 in Phoenix is like 1700 in Boston.  Worth a visit to say you have been there... and if you want a soda fountain, a Coronado alternative to the Sugar Bowl.

The lunchtime service here is so fast they either use cooking ninjas or a microwave. No human can cook this fast.  Maybe the servers read your mind?  Consistent, hot and cheap.  A Phoenix staple... Probably why I see Jerry Colangelo here all the time.

Full disclosure: Tokyo Express was my first job (in 1994).  So I'm probably biased.  This is a Phoenix locals favorite.  The same people have been going here forever.  That being said --- I have tried boatloads of Japanese fast food in my life... and nothing comes close to 'the Tokyo.'  (anyone who EVER compares it to Shogun, etc.  Thems are fighting words.. and I'm a pacifist)  It's fast.  It's cheap.  I love that they place your announce your orders with "ah-nay-guy-she-mas" (which if I remember correctly, means 'please')  The sauce and rice are always perfect.  The salad dressing is out-of-this-world.  20 years I've been going there and I have no idea what's in it.  Probably an addictive chemical.  I don't care.  It is terrific.  I haven't worked in many restaurants but nobody cleaned a kitchen like the management at Tokyo Express.  You never have to worry about the back.  As a teenager I once ordered a sukiyaki bowl 27 shifts in a row... and I still wasn't sick of it by the end.  I only wish there were still more in town but if it's lunchtime and I pass by the one at 10th & Camelback or the one in old town Scottsdale.. Tokyo Express sucks me in like a tractor beam.  If I move away... upon returning, my first meal will be a spicy teriyaki chicken, a couple of side salads (with extra dressing) and a medium tropical iced tea.  That's not a meal.  That's utopia.

When it comes to being Jewish, I'm more ish than Jew... a fellow Heeb nearly dropped dead when I didn't know what a "black & white" was.  I can not-so-boldy tell you I have never had gefilte fish... and God-willing, I never will.  That being said, there are probably all sorts of layers to the onion that is Scott's Generations that I haven't peeled back.  And while I haven't embraced many Heeb traditions --- one thing I dig is the food.  And friends, Generations has the food.  If you're there during lunch, this place gets slammed.  There are roughly a bajillion types of sandwiches, some pastas, you name it.  I'm a half-sandwich and matzoh ball soup guy.  One thing: I can't get the feeling the service here is a little subpar.  Plenty of silver-haired, no-nonsense souls roam the dining room... and they're so nice (and old) that you'll feel guilty correcting them when they screw up.  We got a salad yesterday with no dressing and missing some key ingredients.  When we asked if dressing came on it, she said, "Oh, you wanted dressing?  You didn't ask for any."  I'm not one to rip on service -- I think this is the first I've mentioned it in any review -- but c'mon.  Are we being high maintenance for thinking dressing should come on salads?  Are we rabbits?  Overall --- still the best Jewish deli in town and a great place to go when you need a little deli in your belly.   Calorie counters need not apply.  Bubbie would be proud.

Used this location to print invitations. Initial meeting was great; associate made suggestions on paper, offered to cut the invitations out, to print multiple copies on one page ("this will save you money!").  They were ready the next day, even before agreed upon deadline.  One catch: she didn't disclose that the cutting and putting the 2 on one piece of paper were significant added expenses . Added 50% to the cost of my order of two dozen invites. $10 for the paper cutting (what recession??) and $5 for "file enhancement" (aka printing 2 copies on one page). If this had been proposed beforehand, I'd have said, "Uh, thanks but no thanks."   A VERY IMPORTANT UPDATE: Helene, the location's manager wrote me about my prior negative review and asked to make it right. She offered to refund the entire order and apologized. I have to say --- a very impressive move. There's no doubt FedEx does great work and fast. Now I can say they want repeat business. This was a teachable moment for the staff and I'm grateful for their high tech and expedient response. This was not a high dollar order. They could have just easily let me walk with my business but they did the honorable thing.  I'm upping my review to four stars and will be back.

Shocked to see a low Yelp rating for Healing Arts Day Spa.  Facility is nice (albeit small and in an office complex) and staff was polite and a good massage to boot. And the price is hard to beat. $39 for 60 minutes? (and seems like there's a handful of promotional deals out there on the Internet if you Google around)  Their online reservation system was terrific -- easier than booking a flight --- and appointment started on-time and lasted the full hour.  There are fancier (and much less fancy!) places to get treatment but overall an impressive first visit to the Mesa location.

So this is what mini golf in the Third World looks like!!  I took my Dad here to kill a Sunday afternoon in May.  To say this course "has seen better days" isn't fair to the term better days.  This is course is the Road Kill of Miniature Golf.  Apparently the recession is taking its toll on Tempe's Family Fun Park.  The grievances?  Torn up (or completely missing) turf, broken obstacles, ants aplenty, dried up fake river beds... and a partridge in a pair tree!  (Actually a pear tree would have been a welcome distraction but no way it survives with this lack of upkeep)  I remember going here on a date in the 90s and losing a ball in the water.  Today the only balls getting lost are the batting cage balls, some of which fly through the shoddy safety netting!  (I wish I could make this stuff up)  There are plenty of other distractions at this park (arcade games, batting cages, driving range, bumper boats) --- but if the upkeep is as shoddy as the mini golf course, I'd stay far, far away.

This place doesn't need Yelp's blessings or review because it's been here for a 1,000 years and thanks to the food & drink, will be here for a 1,000 more.  Huge menu with tons of stuff but pizza & wings are the star. Prices are the co-star. We weren't there for happy hour but methinks if you want to get happy (beer) & full (pizza) for not a lot of money, this is the place to do it.  They even have an appetizer that made me like artichokes. (And I HATE artichokes) I think the secret ingredient is magic. Also, perhaps copious amounts of butter.  Family-run operation that definitely appears to be a labor of love --- I put this on my Mt. Rushmore of Italian-style eateries in town (along with Uncle Sam's and Santisi Brothers) -- but you can't beat the bang for your buck.

It's hard to tell if they do a good job or not because I was too busy declining services from aggressive salespeople.  I had previously purchased a $30 wax. They wanted to upgrade that to a better wax with a detail for $90 (with a "free car wash"! Guess what? If I'm paying $90-$120 the car wash isn't free). When I kept declining the self-described "great price" -- he lowered it $20. Then the guy asked me "how much I wanted to pay." This kind of cheesy insulting bartering should take place in the mercados of Tijuana, not at a neighborhood car wash. I was also offered a free windshield replacement with some speech about it not costing me or my inusrance a penny.  I will never go back. My wife will never go back.  I advise the rest of Phoenix do the same.

Wow was this colossally bad. Yelp, I'm shaking my fist in your general direction.  Overpriced, overcooked and underportioned -- either we were there on a particularly bad night or this place has survived on its glory days.  We got this to go; the portions are laughably small. Our dinner party looked at the spread and said, "So where do we want to get dinner?" The good news was no liked it very much so the portions weren't a problem. The egg rolls are more like egg roll tapas. Moo shu chicken was flavorless. Lemon chicken was a mess of soggy chaos, wonton chips overdone.  I'll give an extra star because the nice lady offered bottle water while we waited.  For the life of me, I don't get its high rating. Either we were really unlucky or there's some neighborhood loyalty. A symbolic footnote; we offered our dog the leftover rice and she wouldn't touch it. I empathize with the pooch.

We decided to pay homage to the faux Jewish tradition of "Chinese food on Christmas" and ate here... on Christmas.  We ended up getting the Kung Pao equivalent of coal in our stocking.  I really wanted to like Autumn Court.  A lot.  It's in my neighborhood and not a chain and gets glowing reviews from many-a-Yelper.  Didn't happen.  The owner is a very nice guy but apparently some of his staff had skipped town to Tucson (or something).  I empathize but that ain't our problem.  So he was running around, food came out very slow (our soup never came), the check came out even slower and I'd consider it all pretty average fare.  (Nothing like the turbo speed of China Chili)  It was forgettable Chinese at best.  The restaurant's ambience is nice on the inside with a bar & TVs.  It is bright and clean and welcoming.   I will give this place another shot but the people who have called this "the best Chinese restaurant in Phoenix" went to an Autumn Court in another time, place and/or dimension.

Historically I have been a dealership hater: too many headgames, too many salesman circling out front and condescending finance people in the back. Avondale Toyota turned that trepidation on its head.   No cheap negotiating tactics (no negotiating at all - the numbers are set), aggressive pricing and no surprises. I was cynically waiting for something bad to happen and it never did. There's not even salesmen lurking out front. The price that was quoted via the Internet is what I paid.   Lots of the frills you'd expect from a modern dealership (Snacks! Water!) but bottom line is the prices are good and the experience is near perfect. We had the affable Elgin as a sales guy / finance person (knows his stuff!) but I imagine this dealership's philosophy goes across the board.  We gave this dealership a shot because of Yelp! reviews and are happy to say they were on the money. I have shopped at many dealerships, always left feeling subhuman and finally have a go-to place.

Joe's, I want to love you but I don't. I think there are two types of people that go here. People that know the food is average and people who are in denial because of its geography. Your food is extra "meh" with a side of "Hmmm."  We have been here many times. The set-up is terrific. We make the trek and take our dog to nearby Cosmo Dog Park... then hop over for pizza, hamburgers, salads, etc. (I think we've tried just about everything... to no avail. How do you screw up BBQ pizza??)  Since I may sound like a Negative Nelly, I will say I dig the milkshakes.  So why is it so popular?   This is a haven for East Valley apologists who want to have a signature restaurant to call their own but don't want to drive into "the city." Look into your hearts, people of Mesa / Gilbert. Enough of the charade. You saw it on Food Network and you're happy there's some place there with a line out the door.

The best ice cream sandwich in town and (for future reference) they deliver. What's not to like?  Plenty of adventurous flavors if you're into that sort of thing and if you want the usual suspects (I'm a mint chip aficionado) you'll be pleased. I'm going to be back. A lot.

Good selection and lots of toys but the mark-up on some items is insane... and borderline criminal.  Prices on cables are insane.  I needed a Firewire 800 cable.  The only one they carry is a Belkin.  $49.99.  Amazon sells the EXACT SAME THING with shipping for $15.  Even Belkin themselves have the list price at $39.99.  They know most people will buy things like Blu-Ray players and then will pay jacked up prices for the accessories to go with it.  Very insulting and 1990s-ish.  Now any idiot like me can price-check on a cell phone.  (Worth noting: my issue isn't with this particular location, which seems just as nice and exactly the same as 8 bajillion other Best Buys)

This is a terrific hotel for anyone looking for a quiet place to stay in LV.  The concept is terrific: peaceful, clean, healthy, green.  The lobby has a green tea scent that we really liked.   We called ahead and got a reduced rate from what the website offered and clearance to bring our 65 lb golden retriever.  It is a pet friendly hotel and we were grateful for that.  We forgot a dog bowl but they hooked us up.  The rooms are quaint -- even a little tight if you use the pull out couch --- but the space is useful... Like a modern loft.   Great sink and showerhead with no little plastic bottles to end up in a landfill.  Room also has a nice sized HDTV that rotates so it can be used if you're at the desk, in bed or in the kitchenette.  The free breakfast was just right -- warm breakfast sandwiches, mini fruit smoothies, pastries, etc.   On Saturday they added pancakes, sausage and eggs.  Pool looked small but nice - my parents used it - free cabanas and outside towels.  Only complaints would be that rooms facing the 215 freeway will hear a good deal of highway noise.  The Element is practically on top of it... So request a room on the quiet side.   Also, the grounds are minimalist desert landscape -- fits the green concept but if you bring a dog there isn't grass anywhere in the area...a nice park is about a mile away.  My wife & I were very impressed with the Element and will return and look for other Elements in different cities.

I can't tell if this is a diner or a scene from a movie.... whatever it is, I'm in.  Fairly seedy strip mall just a minute away from Turf Paradise.  Definitely a blue-collar, salt-of-the-earth crowd.  Inside though it's a very classic midwest feeling diner.  I told the waitress it looked like the place "had been there forever"... she told me it had only a few years!  (It used to be in Sunnyslope)...     I couldn't tell if the spelling errors on the all were bad grammar or just an adorable attempt at being folksy.  The prices in this joint will make you feel rich.  It's practically free!  I got the mountain of fried potatoes with eggs, etc.  Delicious and about $5.  My special lady friend got eggs, bacon, hash browns, etc.  Her taste in breakfast is pretty All American --- she gets the same thing in every place so she can always compare.  Gives it a solid thumbs up!  Also... I always think you can tell a good breakfast place by the orange juice.  Tiny's passes the test.  (Butterfield's has the best OJ though)  They promote their blue-ribbon winning cinnamon rolls up front.  We got one to go.  Liked it.  Didn't love it.  I prefer my rolls sans almonds.  How this thing is so popular on Yelp is beyond me --- the food is terrific but I didn't look at the clientele and think "social networking."  I thought "domestic beer" and "belt buckles" and "if-I-keep-staring-at-my-fellow-diners-someone-is-going-to-kick-my-ass"  (I Stereotyped!  There!  I said it!)

Umm.  What are these "hippies" smoking?  I only ask because: a) this isn't a 60s-ish place.  Just because you calling your appetizers "munchies" (I get it!  Like I'm stoned!) and you have a psychadelic menu cover doth not make a hippie place.    This was like the bastard lovechild of TGI Friday's and a 5 and Diner. b) This is some of the heaviest pizza I've ever had.  And not in a good way (like traditional Chicago pie).  You'd better like crust because you get a ton of it.  We did a cheese and a BBQ chicken.  c) Tomato bisque soup is not bisquey.  My wife thought it tasted like tomato sauce.  When she sent it back, the server guessed right "Did you think it tasted like red sauce?"  Apparently we weren't the first.  That ain't a good sign, friends. d) It isn't cheap.  You want good, cheap hippie food?  Go to Two Hippies Beach Stand @ 5th and Camelback. e) Where's the peace on Earth?  It is loud.  We got sat in the back (near the kitchen) which was better.. but up front?   Find me an eating experience where loud helps your experience.  I never notice the noise levels in restaurants.  This was madness.  On the plus side, there are a lot of beers.  They are expensive but it looks like a great deal at happy hour (which is 2-6 M-F).    Northsiders, don't let the convenience trick yourselves into thinking this is good pizza.  You're better than this!

If I were a gambling man, I'd say no way this place stays in business.  We were there with a large group on a Wednesday night.  We were literally the ONLY ones eating in the restaurant.  Never a good sign.  That's like the one night  my goldfish was swimming sideways and I knew in the morning he would be dead.  That's how I felt about Urban Seven's lack of patrons.  There were 14-15 of us.  The server never took my order.   (Honestly, I didn't notice until everyone else had their food.  Hard to blame him for this in a large, boisterous group but no way this happens in a better establishment)  They did take an order from me and comp my meal -- a nice gesture.  One of our friends got their credit cards charged twice.  I mention this because another Yelper has said the same thing.  Either something shady is going on or their staff doesn't know how to use the credit machine.  I compare what I had to above average wedding food.  Nothing memorable but certainly nothing offensive.  Just food.  Two stars for half-priced bottles of wine on a Wednesday.

Maui Dog has been Yelp's greatest gift to me.  I only live 2-3 miles from this hole-in-the-wall and I'd never have stopped in if it weren't for the glowing reviews.... which are on the money.  One of the things that brought me in is the inclusion of a turkey dog on their menu (for those of us who don't eat beef, this is a rarity in a hot dog-themed place).  The menu freaked me out at first?  Pineapple on a hot dog?  Spicy mayo?  Coconut?    I could hear my Mom's voice in my head: "Just try it.  You'll like it."  I don't know what makes it work... but it works in spades.  (Might be worth it for the bun alone.  Maui Dog is issuing a challenge to all you other hot dog joints.  The bun counts!)    They also have terrific vegetarian chili, cole slaw and a brownie that John joked to us "will be the second best brownie you've ever had."   Speaking of John... he is one of the nicest restaurateurs I've ever met.  Odds are if he's there when you're there you'll find that out too.  The location is a little strange --- easy to find but kind of isolated.  I think this is a few blocks city away from being one of the best fast food restaurants in Phoenix.    Maui, you've won me over.

Reviewing solely for the self-serve dog wash, which might be the best in town ---  Very easy for the dogs to get in and out, lots of room for a person to stand on both sides of the tub (which is great if there is two of you), no upgrades if you want different shampoos, etc. Very helpful staff.   And here's the kicker (and an INSANE deal). if you buy a bag of food or case of canned, the self wash is free. That's a $17 coupon, friends.  They carry high end foods. Yes, I"m looking at you PURINA feeders.  We will be de-smelling our golden retriever at Kosmo's from here on out.

I think the only thing that could make this place more chaotic at lunchtime is if the building were on fire. Even then, you probably couldn't tell the difference.  I was told the sub rolls were no good so she put me in a 7-grain.... which was $1 extra. They sold me a drink for iced tea (only there was no ice. Or tea. And no plans to refill either). Slightly warm lemonade to wash down my turkey sandwich? WHERE DO I SIGN UP!?!?  Such prime real estate deserves better... Prices are cheap but much better sandwiches around town. I'd take a knuckle sandwich over a Jimmy John's.

I'm going to give Kokoro 4 stars out of the gate but there is plenty of room for improvement. Caution: I was there on their 2nd day of business, before even their grand opening (and without serving their full menu) so I will update this review after a few more visits.  The good? A good selection of sushi at reasonable prices. Until now the only downtown sushi has been Moira (and it is good... but expensive!) The priciest roll on Kokoro's menu is nine bucks. I hope this brings in some ASU downtown kids to keep this place open where others have failed (including its previous occupant, a curry place that lasted about 15 minutes.)  The lunch special is a terrific deal. Chicken or beef and rice, a salad, 4 piece California roll and 3 pieces of tempura for $8.50. It is a belt-loosening lunch portion. Salad & tempura were solid. Chicken (both teriyaki and honey sesame) could use some work but they are early in the game.   The not-so-good?  For the terrific lunch special, if you get it to go -- you walk with 3 styrofoam containers. A bunch of people from my office got food and everyone reacted the same way. A good amount of food but it felt wrong to throw all that away.  UPDATE: Looks like they've remedied this down to 2 containers. But the greener way to eat at Kokoro is definitely to eat in-house.  Flow of traffic to place orders is a little crammed (partially due to nobody wanting to sit outside). But making you way to the counter requires Formula 1-style maneuvering.  Four stars for bringing a modestly-priced, casual but legit sushi place to downtown Phoenix.  The owners have 2 West Valley Asian restaurants I have not been to but I applaud the move. I work in the area and hope this place does well.

Ridiculously friendly staff that has insight on different foods, supplements, treats to offer your four-legged friends --- the food prices are on par with big box stores but they offer frequent buyer programs and lots of coupons in the mail... (ask to sign up for the mailing list) Small, easy to get in and out and customer-centric --- I like the late hours, even on weekends (which is usually when I panic and realize I don't have enough dog food to get me through Monday, much less the week).  I've found a few of the items (some toys etc) are cheaper elsewhere but if you're smart about it you can save a lot of money and it's my favorite pet food store in the area (and there are a lot of good ones around here).

Cafe 1010 is one of the best kept secrets in the area --- I'll tell you about if you promise not to go blabbing to everyone. Deal?  Tucked away in the government building district, there's easy garage parking (free! shhh!) --- inside the Cafe is a grill that does everything from burgers to turkey reubens (Juan is a grill ninja master. Ask for crispy fries.) --- daily specials like fish & chips or baked ziti or taco salad or filet mignon (I may have made the last one up) --- I have not been here for breakfast but the regulars swear by the breakfast burrito.  Another pro tip: don't tell Emilio, the affable owner (and frequent cashier) --- but his prices are trapped in 1999. Very, very affordable. Convenience store prices. I also like, as a diet soda person, that the fountain drinks include Diet Coke (bah humbug!) but also Coke Zero (getting better) and Diet Dr. Pepper (is this aspartame heaven?) Plus there's coffee and iced tea and juice and ---   OK, enough reading. Go to Cafe 1010. Don't tell your friends. Our little secret. Deal?
