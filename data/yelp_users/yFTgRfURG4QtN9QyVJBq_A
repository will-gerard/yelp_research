I took my puppy Stanley here for his first vet visit and was more than pleased with the staff, atmosphere, and level of service. I gave them a rating of 4 only because it was our first visit. Time will tell but I am pleased thus far. Stanley was a nervous barking puppy and the staff calmed him (and me!) and were able to examine him. I've been to other vet offices and this was by far the cleanest. I feel like my puppy is in good hands.

This is the perfect place to hide for a romantic dinner or dessert and drinks. The owner always comes to our table with a rose and the servers are well versed in the wine and food selections. LOVE Pesto's!

I don't get the fascination with this place. It's crowded and loud and the food is overpriced.

Ladies, if you need a car, go here. I recently traded in my 2004 Ford Ranger in for a 2006 Mercury Mountaineer and couldn't be more pleased at the level of service I received. From the time I called and spoke to Andrew to signing the papers for the new-to-us car, we were treated with respect. (As a woman, that is rarely the case when I've bought a car.) Through each step of the process with Nick and Brady at Mesa Motors treated me as a valued customer, asking questions to find me the vehicle to fit my needs. It was a refreshing experience . I recommend Mesa Motors to everyone I know.

From the service to the food to the made-from-scratch margaritas, this is our go-to spot for Mexican food. Don't be fooled by the lackluster appearance, this place is worth visiting again and again. I recommend the carne asada, carnitas, or mole. Delish.

Only my absolute favorite coffee shop in the valley. Great service, drinks, and music.

If I had reviewed Postino's East when they first opened, they would have gotten five stars. Service is slower, music is louder now. I went at 4pm on a stormy Thursday so it was a better-than-expected experience. When I've gone later in the evening, I've experienced a lack of service (like no one filling water, asking if we want more wine or food). More than once I've complained. They give a coupon for a free appetizer; I'd rather have the app I ordered (twice) comped immediately. It's go-to for location only. Glad to see more choices available in the area.

Bob Wilson is an expert at business and life coaching combining experience and expertise with passion and insight. As mutual clients we have worked together to create better than expected results for our businesses. Not only is Bob a consummate professional, he's a great friend. As a member of a Success Team that Bob facilitated I was afforded the opportunity to be coached by Bob, to learn about myself and to see Bob coach others to help them reach their dreams and goals. It is a privilege and let's face it, a lot of fun, to know and work with Bob!

Clean store with great prices. We took a list of the food we buy most often to WinCo and other  grocery stores. WinCo was BY FAR the most affordable for grocery items. We drink coffee every morning and were paying $7-12 for a pound; we found the same coffee at WinCo for $5-7. You can find better deals and higher quality meat elsewhere but check the meat here too. If you watch the prices, you can get non-food items like toilet paper and paper towels at good prices.

This location has successfully NOT gotten my order right more times than I can count. Glad another opened up down the street in Chandler.
