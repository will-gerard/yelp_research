Tomato jam bruschetta.  That's all you need to know.

I'm a huge fan of BCVC. Not only is the location extremely convenient for me but the facility is well maintained and very inviting. Dr. Ryan is one of the sweetest and most caring Veterinarians I have every met. She takes the time to listen to what you have to say and when it comes to treatment for illness or ailments she actually gives you options as apposed to giving you a list of treatments, pill, x-rays etc., that your pet "must have". Pets can be very expensive so it's nice to know that there are Vet's out there that will give you honest and realistic treatment options.   Even though I am moving all the way across town, I will still come to see Dr. Ryan at BCVC...She's awesome!

My boyfriends Mom and Sister referred me to to Paulene's. The place is sort of hidden between a yogurt shop and Wildflower Bread Co. I walked in on a Thursday mid afternoon, asked for a mani/pedi and got right in. I was surprised how busy the were for it being mid week and all. The staff was nice and polite and complimented my color choice...perhaps they were just being nice. :) Tammy did both the mani and pedi. She was very patient with me as I had asked for the Gel Soak Off for both. It usually takes a bit longer as there are more steps involved. Tammy was sweet and had a very relaxed tone in her voice. She worked clean and efficient and didn't try to push any extras...which I hate!!  4 weeks and counting after my visit, my pedicure looks brand new.  Sort of amazing for an open toe shoe junkie.  Paulene's is clean, quick and a very pleasant experience. all around.  Note:  Bring cash for tips...their CC machine only runs as debit.  :(  I had to take one star away for that.

As a pet parent it's always hard to leave your pet in the hands of strangers. After trying the usual suspects in pet boarding we tried Second Home Pet Resort. It was a fabulous decision and we are so lucky to have found them!!   SHPR is not the usual boarding place and I don't even like to use the word "boarding" when referencing them. It's more like a hotel or resort as it states in the name. The place is beautiful and clean and smells great. They will let you take a tour before your pet stays there which I think is smart...there is nothing to hide. They are obviously very proud of what they do, and want you to feel comfortable about where your pet stays.   My dog Salinger LOVES the water park!! He's not so friendly with other male dogs so he gets to play with the staff members instead. It's a wonderful option for my snobby little guy.   I recommend this place to anyone who really cares about the happiness of their pet or if you are hesitant about who takes care of your pet. You can tell that everyone on staff here really loves animals and their jobs.   Your pets will be in good hands at SHPR...I promise.

I don't even want to waste a lot of time talking about how bad this place is...I'll try and sum it up.   *Dining room was dirty, uncomfortable and hot.   *Service was lacking. 10 min for the first greet. 20 min to order. 30 min for food. Every chance the server had he would go an do his side-work while eating...right in front of us.   *Found a water glass at the table with lipstick. When we asked for a new one the server simply pulled one of the table new to us. NOTE: server man handled the glass at the top...where people put their lips!   Food: Blah. Nothing exciting to report.  Maybe it's because I could get past the server putting his hands all over my glass.  Yikes.   I wanted to like this place...

Needed a pace to store our things for a year while we moved in with Mom. Units was the most affordable and practical option for us. After securing a Unit and scheduling a time, the truck showed up with a very large and very clean storage unit. Once we loaded up our things the truck came back, picked up the Unit and took it to an air conditioned warehouse. Throughout the year the family owned business took care of our little Unit and sent payment reminders via email. The customer service was great and come to find out, Units is a family owned business which is awesome because I'm all for supporting local businesses.  Friendly employees, clean units, quick service.  Long story short, Units was a fantastic option for storage and moving. Highly recommended!

Had my car towed to the dealership not too long ago. Did a search and found these guys on Yelp. They had a deal that if you mentioned the Yelp ad you'd receive a 15% discount...not a bad deal considering how expensive towing can be.   Pros: Quick service, great customer service, took care of all the details when leaving the car at the dealership, super nice guys all around.   Con: I'm not sure my neighbors were too thrilled about the crazy loud music blaring from the tow truck at 9:15 at night...just sayin'.   I'm a fan. I'll recommend and use again.

Salon Stylush is an adorable salon in Scottsdale.  Just as adorable as the salon are the ladies who own and operate it.  I have followed Jenny from the last two salons she has been at will continue to do as as long as I am in Arizona.  Cuts, styling and color are what I see her for and no joke I get compliments ALL the time.  We've played around with length and color over the years and I have never had a bad visit and it always looks natural.  I trust Jenny completely with whatever she does.   I'm so excited to have her do hair for my wedding in October!  I know I'm going tho have "kick ass" hair!  The space is fun and inviting and they always make you feel welcome.  The decor is unique and funky...love the curtains!  All of the ladies here are up on the most current trends in hair so you'll never have an "old lady" hair style.  Go visit the ladies of Salon Stylush!!

We visited on a busy Friday evening.  The place was packed and had great energy.  There was a wait which really didn't matter since we like to sit at the bar so when two seats quickly opened and we sat immediately.  The ambiance is worth five stars alone.  The decor, the open windows and the amazing wine room make this place inviting and attractive.  After ordering the wine and an appetizer (Wood Grilled Artichoke) we waited...and waited...and waited some more.  The bartender noticed how long we waited several times and kept checking with the kitchen.  After about 35 minuets and an apology from the bartender the artichokes we delivered by someone...perhaps a manager with another very forced and dry apology.  The chokes were OK, but not fully cooked but the ailoi was delicious.  As expected  two minutes after the app was dropped our entrees arrived...annoying.  The Grilled Vegetable dish was served with a goat cheese spread and overall was good but not something I'd order again (my fault for ordering).  My husband had the Steak Frites and enjoy it.    As soon as the check was dropped the service dropped.  Not once did the bartender ask if we wanted another glass of wine when our glasses sat empty for nearly 30 min nor was there any further contact from any employee.  The best part of the whole experience was when the bartender who wad been serving us that night grabs her purse, clocks out and then sits next to the guy sitting next to us and starts having a conversation.  I guess she didn't care that we hadn't paid yet...she must not be hurting for tips?  I understand food timing issues and that kitchens get backed up sometimes but I don't understand poor service and the lack of recovery from staff and especially the managers.  If something is wrong at a table or the bar, it is the managers responsibility to take action and not ignore it.

This review is meant to be constructive.  I would generally submit feedback directly to the business site but I couldn't find anything on their site that lead me in that direction.  First time visitor with high expectations.  I understand the concept and what they are trying to do.  I appreciate the claim of quality, clean ingredients, local farms, fresh food on the go and all of that. With my visit and purchase today I don't feel like their quality standards were achieved therefore, there was little value in what I received and experienced.    Ordered the South Beach.  I enjoyed the taste of everything, the blueberries were fresh and firm, beets were fresh, kale was crisp and firm, dressing tart.  Missed steps:  Soggy, slimy spinach, inedible beet exterior pieces, stems on blue berries, portion of chicken and blue berries was lacking and missing pistachios.  I discarded quarter of my salad that I found to be unappetizing or inedible.  I am happy to pay $13 for a salad that delivers on it's promise, this salad did not, and was definitely not worth the money spent.   I'll try Grabbagreen again once the sting has worn off.  I'm intrigued by the rest of the menu and concept itself.

Wow.  Discovered MLP though a last minute Yelp search...All 5 star reviews deserves a look for sure! Needed some flowers the day of for a birthday.  The arrived about two hours after ordering looking fresh and super cute all wrapped up in craft brown paper.  My sister-in-law loved them!  Made her day and mine too!  What a cool concept and impressive service.  So glad I found them.  Will for sure be using them and spreading the word.
