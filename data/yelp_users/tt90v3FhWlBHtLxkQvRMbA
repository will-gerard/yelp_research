Went to use a groupon and they said we had to have six people to use it, I explained we were going to have a couple bottles of wine and our food bill would be more than what the groupon was worth.  We left and I will be asking groupon for a refund.  The place looked dirty so maybe it was a blessing.

This is a wonderful place to take dance lessons.  My Fiance and I purchased the groupon for our upcoming wedding, well with only a week before the wedding they work us into the schedule.  The teacher was great to work with and taught us the right dance steps to our song we wanted to dance with.  We will be going back for more. Thanks!!!

We took our car in there for the normal service, oil change, tire rotate, bah bah bah...  200 plus bucks, which is expensive, but we like to say that all the cars service has been done at the dealership when we go to sale a car.  We will never bring our car back to these jokers.  When we picked up the car, the steering wheel was starched and gashed.  We took it right back in and they immediately said they didn't do it and that it was normal wear and tear.  Then the manager tried to say make-up from my wife was the issue,  it's my daily driver and I don't wear makeup and last time I checked makeup doesn't gash faces when applied.  They then offered to replace the steer wheel that they supposedly didn't damage at employee pricing with no labor.  Umm if you didn't do the damage why would you offer to do that.  The fact is that they knew they did the damage, but still tried to get into my pocket book for more money. It was very clear the gash was new because of the color and where it was at.  I wouldn't even let these guys service a kids hot wheels car......  VERY BAD SERVICE!

They also go above and beyond on service.  I showed up at this store thinking I put in a catering order and my mistake I placed it at a different store, they had not problem hurrying up getting me all the meat I needed and canceling the other stores order for me.  Thanks guys.
