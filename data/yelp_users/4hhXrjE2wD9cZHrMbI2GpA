Sacks never misses.  Their daily special whether the sandwich hot or cold, salad, or soup are always spot on.  Usually on Friday they feature the Kona Club, this is a CAN"T miss sandwich(just be sure to get the sauce on the side, if getting to go!!)

Sunday. food good. Posole yes. 5 bloody Mary bar. Takes a long time for them to replenish bar though, bacon, olives, green beans,  etc. But service holy slow. 10 minutes to run card. Really? Asked hostess if understaffed,  she says no really busy, um not that busy. So your understaffed,  because you plan for this, Sunday brunch crowd

Wait! Taco Tuesday.  $20 for 2 adults, 1 child. 5 total tacos, 1 kids meal, and chips and salsa.....tacos were definitely worth the  $2 per taco. Plus a bucket of chips and salsa. Definitely will return for Taco Tuesday.

Inexpensive, decent flavor rotation, bike rideable  (close by) and the kid loves it. The day we went Island Banana, good. Paddy's Chocolate Peppermint, good. Gorilla Peach, good. Strawberry Margarita,  which I did sample, was also good. Place is always clean and quick!

I have had Mamma's pie when she was located at Short Leash, they are good and I will probably go there again. I went there at 2pm on pie day and they were out of pie. Really? How do you not plan for this? Girl behind counter said come back later, that they are trying to restock. I am with a 6 year old princess who wants pie on pie day!

Pretty darn good. Peanut butter cup pancake,  pleasantly not overly sweet,  was very delicious. Green eggs and hamwich on cibatta was also very good. Decent coffee and espresso, too. Service is good, restaurant  is clean, ping pong on the patio. Yelpers give bad reviews because they go at peak times and have to wait, sorry that wait comes with GREAT places. Think out side the box....don't go at peak times, just get up and go.

Breakfast pizza, "brizza", Chicago,  very filling, but tasty, enough to share and to eat for lunch. Biscuits and gravy, brown gravy, yum. Unlimited coffee, 3 varieties. Order first and then sit down with your number, food comes out very quickly. Would give 5 stars, but prices are kind of on the high side for breakfast. Overall great place.

Everything is always good.  Peanut butter cup, salted caramel, green tea macha, Irish cream, chocolate Guinness.  One of the best local ice cream places in the valley.

Good appetizers.  Wings are good, with nice spice dry rub,  and I believe a Frank's Red Hot Sauce based dipping sauce. Pretzel sticks with dipping fondue. The steak is good and was cooked as ordered. French fries could use a little work. The kids mac and cheese looked like Kraft boxed mac and cheese,  the menu stated it was spiral pasta, it wasn't, please fix the menu. Nice draft selection, they do flights of beer,nice! Only 3 beers UBH beers, though....but they feature other Arizona craft brews.

This place is always busy and always good. They take reservations. FYI. Start off with garlic naan with dipping sauces, they spicy one, yes! Share a Taj Mahal, it's hot outside, so refreshing. Main dishes chicken galam for the squid and spicy vindaloo with spicy naan, add Hindu hot sauce, oh yeah sinus is clear!! Overall the place is a can't mess highly recommended.

It was good. Had the special pizza of the week, will definitely go back to try the cauliflower pizza. The beer cheddar brocholi soup was stupid good. Can't wait to get back there. Good rotation of beers on tap

Looking for lunch on Friday afternoon, driving around aimlessly. Passed by Guacamoles the other day, purposely drove in that direction. Passed by it again, pulled up on Yelp, u-turn, let's check it out. Order the "3 Traditional Tacos" everything on them. *barbacoa. Really?  fooled me where's the flavors, okay add salsa *carne asada.  Meat needs to be marinated, again no flavor add green and red salsa *cochinita pibil. Not bad the best of the 3, but that doesn't say much add salsa  verde I might go back to try something else in the future,
