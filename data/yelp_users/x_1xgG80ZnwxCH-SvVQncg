Absolutely love love love this restaurant! Great food and entertainment! The belly dancers are amazing to watch. My boyfriend and I have been here several times. He is from Tunisia and loves this place. One evening they had an event with a cover charge and we just wanted drinks. Instead of letting us go elsewhere for cocktails the owner offered us seats on the patio so we could enjoy the evening with sheesha and drinks. Definitely knows how to treat a customer. Very impressed with this establishment and will be back!

Best sheesha I've had so far! The mint sheesha is amazing! We had a large party for my boyfriend's birthday and the staff moved around other customers to accommodate us. They answered questions and provided excellent customer service!

I highly recommend you go see Rich for all your auto repair needs! He has made several repairs on my car and I've never had any issues with his work. The first time I went there was because my dealership couldn't find the fuse that needed replaced. Rich found it in literally a minute and replaced the fuse absolutely free.   Ever since then I only trust Rich to fix my car. Today I drove an hour from North Scottsdale/Paradise Valley where I now live so that he could replace my brakes. His prices are very competitive and worth the drive! Thanks Rich for always taking care of me!

A fantastic place to take your dog! Took my dog Faith in for grooming and a full day of doggie daycare and she had a great time! The staff was friendly and very informative. Not only that, Lori was able to trim her nails when many other places couldn't. She found a method that worked! I highly recommend you try Lori's Grooming!

Was very disappointed with this hookah lounge. The sheesha was very good but the music was a disappointment. We were told they couldn't play Arabic music due to the American customers. I'm American and my boyfriend is from Tunisia and we wanted to enjoy sheesha and good music. Instead there was a customer who may have been an employee playing only Spanish music to cater to their group of friends. Also the furniture was very worn down and marble tables broken that could cut someone if not paying attention. Needless to say we didn't stay very long at all and won't be returning!
