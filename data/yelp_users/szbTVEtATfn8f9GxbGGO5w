I thought this place was kind of a ripoff and the food was mediocre at best.  I got the arroz con pollo and a large drink for just over ten bucks which I personally thought was a lot, but I got a couple salsa cups and took a seat.  The salsas were okay I guess, one is called casera and it sure tasted like the Herdez Salsa Casera you get at the grocery store. My lunch arrived and it wasn't quite the arroz con pollo I'm used to.  The rice was completely devoid of flavor, the chicken was a very small portion of thigh meat simply grilled which tasted okay but certainly nothing to write home about.

I had a pretty good lunch experience here the other day.  Very friendly staff, the place was quite busy and all the ladies were running food and drinks out to customers but everyone still had a smile on their face. Great deal too, for less than eight bucks you can get the lunch special with salad, two mini egg rolls, chicken and rice and the portions are enormous.  I probably finished about half and I was stuffed!  Good food too the sweet & salty teriyaki was nicely complimented by a char-grill smokiness.  I look forward to my next visit!

This place is like crack for foodies :)  You just cannot get enough!  This should be #1 on your list when out of towners visit you, they'll just drop their collective jaws.  Hit Tradiciones for lunch or dinner and then the market for those tortillas steamin' in the bag OMFG there's little finer in life!!  Their homemade chorizo is spot on, produce is good (and CHEAP!) .  I want one in Moon Valley!

Well, I was driving between work locations and in need of a quick lunch when I saw Yoshi's through the windshield.  I thought I remember hearing this was owned by the same guy who did Yasu Sushi (which is sublime) so I went in despite the large Pepsi banner outside.  I should have known just by that a lackluster experience was about to be had... I ordered the spicy dragon beef bowl and gyoza and an iced tea :)  The beef had an interesting flavor akin to melted plastic.  I kept waiting for the spicy to kick in but it never did.  The gyoza were cold, yet amazingly enough they were crunchy enough to chip teeth if you weren't careful. The tea wasn't bad...

A very solid 3.75 star review :) So, I leave my last job site at Camelback & 7th Ave. starving and looking for something non-chain and non-hamburger.  I start to head east and Cherry Blossom suddenly popped into my view.  I've certainly read about them over the years, never made it by so now's my chance! I am so glad I ended up here for lunch, especially this ccccooollllddd week (hey, at least for Phoenix).  Nothing goes down better on a cold day than soup, for me at least particularly Asian noodle soups.  Like Gabi mentions Phoenix is definitely lagging behind San Jose, Honolulu, Chicago, name your place-they all got mindblowingly good ramen/noodle house type restaurants. My opinion is that the Valley has more Southeast Asians (Thai, Vietnamese, Cambodian) than Japanese so pho or tom yum gai isn't as hard to find as good ramen.  Cherry Blossom's version is not like any I've had before-I usually simply order the cha su ramen in whatever size is not the gigantic bucket full.  Cherry Blossom's was not a clear broth, rather it was almost a creamy white laden with seaweed and pork and those wonderful noodles....I could eat a WHOLE lot of this...coupled with eight pieces of California roll, salad with some pretty solid ginger dressing, and bread (??) with a tropical iced tea set me back $11.   Very good food and good value I'd say too!  I see you again soon Cherry Blossom!!

I had lunch here the other day and it was really pretty good, that 16th / Bethany intersection is not lacking for good restaurants either!  I went with six other people and everybody really liked it.  Smooth decor, decent service, and competently prepared food with a SW flair.  Soup, sandwiches, salads, all were a hit!!  Their brunch is the stuff of legends although I have yet to partake.

Sure, it's a chain but I like Schmick's at happy hour for sure and it's pretty good for lunch too.   Do not pass up the Thresher Shark, and their mashed potatoes are frickin' killer.  I've actually never had a loser from Schmick's I even have their cookbook! Dinner's a bit much price wise for me, although for what I've experienced off their lunch menu I'm sure the quality is excellent.  I am a 2nd generation cheapskate though so GIMME A $2 CHEESEBURGER!!

I really don't know why this place gets any positive reviews. I've been to New Orleans a couple times but am by no means a Cajun/Creole conniseur (SP??).  Their food is downright bland and nowhere near the level of NOLA and we're talking a cuisine that thrives on spicy/flavorful food!!  I went with five friends and nobody was all that impressed.  Cute location with patio seating and decent staff though. All this talk about Ragin' Cajun' closing and now this crap is the best in Phoenix...my Lord I'll start a Cajun place and make a mint!! With my Russian heritage and all it will be a home run!! Or maybe I'll just stick to my day job :(

Three locations??  I'll have to look into that, I've been to the one on Bell and the one on Camelback and a great time was had by all on both occasions!  I got hooked on Cuban food whilst visiting the sister in law down in Florida many years back.  I've not had a Cuban sandwich that rivals those on South Beach here in Phoenix, not like that's any big surprise...Havana Cafe is about as good as it gets in the Valley.  And thankfully they actually do a pretty good job! Try thier paella next time, I thoroughly enjoy their version.

Sliders.  I need say no more.  But I will :) That is the only thing I've ever had at this restaurant.  Now, if you're a transplant from the Midwest and a fan of White Castle they are not exactly like that.  They are bigger but a good percentage of the slider goodness you're used to.  I still go to the Castle when I go back home for Christmas, really you either love 'em or you hate 'em.  I'm enamored!!

What a cute place!! That is about the only positive thing about Aunt Chilada's, unfortunately.  The food is not even mediocre IT SUCKS!!  Started with the nearly inedible chips and the dressed-up-ketchup salsa all the way through dessert was downright misery!  And the service sucks too :(

I will never take my cats to the vet again!!  Good news is now the vet can come here, and it's much less stressful on all of us : ) We got two cats from the Humane Society last year (not related) and they are just now starting to get along.  When one of them got stung by a scorpion the office visit to the vet set relations way back.  All the strange smells, one's an alpha and one's perhaps a delta or epsilon, I didn't see either of them much except for fighting... So, when my epsilon had an eye issue I decided to seek out a mobile vet-I don't know why I didn't consider this sooner.  Dr. Kennaway was just wonderful and I would certainly patronize her business again without hesitation.  Prices were better than I expected for an in-home visit.

Okay, I'm not one to usually flame places, but they deserve it!! I had about the worst experience EVER at Shogun, and I didn't even get a chance to try their food! Went a few Saturdays back for lunch with a friend.  Upon arriving a harried guy told us to just sit anywhere, which we did.  We were catching up and after a bit realized that ~15 minutes had elapsed since we sat down.  No menus, no 'can I get you a drink', nothing.  We sheepishly looked around for our host who was nowhere to be found.  There were some occupied tables, but I would not classify it as 'busy' by any means. I flagged down a sweaty waiter who said that everyone had called in sick and he was doing his best to keep up.  He brought us both iced tea, which we did not order nor did we really want.  Still no menus. After half an hour of sitting there Mr. Sweaty threw menus on our table and assured us he would be right back.  He kept this promise and took our orders.  Tick tock Clarice.... AFTER A SOLID FRICKIN' HOUR we just left.

I agree with Sean, as a Chicago native every good 'street food' type joint has the hot dog statue outside and the sports posters and stuff lining the walls. Today saw me ordering a gyro and I really would not recommend this as a gyro place.  The pita was good enough, but the meat was weird-dry and VERY lemony...tzatziki would hold it's own I suppose but the meat totally took away from the experience.  Seven bucks for a gyro and small pop.  Take that for what it's worth.......... I've eaten lunch here previously and I thought the beef sandwiches were okay, not great by any means but I'd order a beef sandwich way before the gyros should I lose my mind and patronize this establishment again.

I actually like Brennan's, you wouldn't really think their food would be as good as it is.  I typically order Mexican type stuff and haven't been disappointed.  I went a few days ago for lunch with a couple friends after a golf game and everybody really enjoyed their meal.  I had fajitas and my friends had carnitas and grilled chicken salad, good portions, decent salsa and guacamole and BIG pop/tea glasses!!  I've never done 'real' drinks there, but I will say that football season does indeed bring a good share of rowdy fans so I agree that it's not a good place to bring the kids. Their prices can be a little high, but there's always coupons from the Entertainment book or restaurant.com-our bill was less than $20 with a GC from the latter :)

I love Oregano's and probably one of the better things that I can say is that one location is as good as the next.  I've probably been to Oregano's upwards of thirty times and I've not had a bad experience yet.  The lines outside of any of their restaurants should be a solid indicator of their quality.  Good pizza is hard to find out here in Phoenix, I've tried many and other than Rosati's I've really not been very impressed. Maybe when my tax check comes I'll take four hours and visit Pizzeria Bianco :)

Went in for a fairly simple tattoo of script along the forearm and my artist was Chris Bailey.  The end result was great and Chris was very friendly and professional.   Except...I don't know what it is with the plastic wrap after the tattoo here in Phoenix (and it's not just this shop).  Wounds need air to heal, I've never seen a tattoo shop use plastic wrap other than here in AZ.  I'd say do your own research on aftercare but I took the saran wrap off in the parking lot.

Nuts, I wish I would have looked on Yelp before I went to learn about the beer & sake deal :) I stopped into this plaza to go to the Fry's when I noticed Fresh Wasabi-same sign as the place I recently visited out in Surprise which I liked, so I headed in for lunch (best to grocery shop on full stomach you know!). I found the service to be a tad slow especially considering I was one of just a handful of patrons.  Slow but friendly, just like me!! Anyhoo, I simply cannot get past the pork katsu/California Roll bento.  Every aspect is really good, the miso soup, salad, edamame just seem to be a perfect combo plate to me especially since I'm not a huge fan of raw.  Price/value ratio is good, though I think the Surprise location offers a wee bit more generous portions. This visit actually inspired me to try and recreate the bento at home with some pretty decent success-my miso soup was even better than Fresh Wasabi's lol!

I'm very surprised I'm the first to review this awesome West Valley spot.   I went with a big (14 people) group after a movie last Saturday.  The service was about at full capacity and therefore my drink laid empty a little longer than it should have, but it's not as if anyone was slacking by any means. With such a big group I was able to sample many dishes and there wasn't a loser in the bunch.  My chicken zingarella was fantastic, as were the stuffed mushrooms.  I must go back to try the gnocchi!

I wasn't really impressed with this place at all.  On the positive side their medium salsa was quite good, but they just give you a squirt bottle when you get your food (i.e. don't expect to get complimentary chips and salsa).  My lunch was the chicken taco and green tamale combo.  The tamale was nearly petrified, in fact I had to cut it half way in order to remove it from the corn husk it had grown glued to over, oh I don't know, a week??  The chicken in the taco seemed to suffer the same petrification process.  The rice and beans weren't bad.

I enjoyed my visit to Asadero Toro.  The decor is minimalist, folding chairs and tables in an old Wendy's and a small bar with salsas and pickled vegetables on ice.  You gotta get carne asada at an asadero, I thought, and it was a good choice.  It comes served on a plastic tray much like you'd find at a school cafeteria, I felt special though as the other patrons got styrofoam plates :)  The food was delicious, solid tortillas, and they even gave me a char-grilled onion quarter.

I always find it reassuring when I pull up to a Mexican restaurant that there's a bunch of landscaping trucks parked and the guys are inside eating lunch :)  I thought Mixteca did a pretty good job with my carne asada tacos, rice and beans were not a complete afterthought, decent chips and salsa bar.  The staff was friendly (they actually SMILED). I was about to get a little p.o.'d when my taco platter and small Diet Coke was more than nine dollars but rest assured the portions are by no means skimpy.  The decor was typical fresh-Mex beach type, I could certainly see myself enjoying a cerveza on the large patio when the sub-100 degree days resume!

I think I found a new favorite pho place, and bonus-it's really close to work!  I've read about Maxim for some time and I finally found myself with an opportunity to try it a few weeks back.  I've probably been back three times and I just cannot get past pho tai despite my going in with the idea of trying something new. The broth is wonderfully complex and they give you a good assortment of fresh herbs for additional punch.  Prices are great and the family that runs the place is very friendly.

I've always been impressed with Shooter's World.  I've taken a class (with Anthony), shot at the range (Jared made sure all was well), purchased items, did an FFL transfer and I've yet to encounter an employee that wasn't very helpful and friendly.  The staff is always vigilant about safety on the range, in the classroom and at the counter-I've never seen even a hint of any unsafe activity at Shooter's World.

I've been here plenty of times since I moved to Phoenix seven years ago, and I've finally had a dish I wasn't thrilled with-carnitas.  It was more like oven-roasted pork slices, not anything like I'm used to. But....this is the first time in seven years I've been disappointed.  Their arroz con pollo is very good, carne asada, tacos, enchiladas, chimis, you name it-solid dumpy Mexican place!! I've always been treated very well by the staff and never overcharged :)

Don't be ashamed, Deb.  Costco is the shizz nizzle dizzle if I can be so-ten-years-ago.  And there's always a free mini lunch (via samples) when you visit and they do carry many superior products at prices not found lower elsewhere.  Though sometimes their prices are higher than grocery stores on some stuff, do your research and don't fall victim to the impulse buy no matter how agonizingly difficult it is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!LJH)*HFOH Okay, soooo-you can get discount FOX group restaurant cards, prime ribeyes for 8.99/lb (though rare) and the most killer La Brea Artisan bread, not to mention cheeses and Steelhead trout which is the bomb and laundry soap and...okay, I guess you get the point.  Costco ROCKS.

Somebody on Facebook mentioned Taylor's as a good place for seafood on the West side, so I checked out the Yelp reviews.  I think I had realistic expectations going in, sort of a blue hair place, nothing fancy but good bang for the buck. I ordered a cup of New England clam chowder (it's a chowder house, right?) and the grilled Mahi.  The chowder was okay, a good amount of clams, but it had an odd flavor to me...cheap sherry maybe?  It's basically just potato and clam and I personally like some bacon, celery, etc. The Mahi was definitely strange, I expect a 'grilled' piece of fish to be simply cooked over some sort of open flame.  It arrived scored on top with no visible grill marks.  It also had a sort of teriyaki sauce on top that, frankly, ruined the fish-it was hideous.

You know, after decades of different restaurant experiences from pasta just outside the Vatican, Antipasti in Bologna, fish and chips in a London pub, Haggis in Edinburgh........pierogies and kielbasa in Chicago's Polish 'hood, Seattle's Pike's Place, Gilroy Garlic Festival, Hatch Chile Fest....I could go on and on... Sooooo...Roaring Fork-if I had to pick a quintessential Arizona restaurant, this would be it.  It's cowboy/Southwest but just superbly prepared and served.  The staff is more than accomodating, and everyone in our party just had the best experience. I'm this .[read index finger and thumb about a quarter inch apart]. far from duplicating their green chile pork MWWWWWWWWAHAHAHA!!  :)  Seriously, this dish is killer and a must try!! T out!

Okay, if you've not visited this Valley institution by now I don't understand what you're waiting for.  Go now, really-put down your mouse, shut off your computer and GO! It's certainly the old school aspect that adds to their appeal, for once you get taken back to a by-gone era with the red velvet and killer cocktails, good steaks.  Are they the BEST EVER steaks?  No, those are cooked up by me at home but Durant's are pretty dang good.

This is a generous slant on 3.5 stars as this is probably the best experience food wise that I've had at a Fox restaurant. I really, really do want to like them as the atmosphere and service are always second to none but the food usually falls short especially for the prices. The restaurant was quite full, as was Keirland-anybody hear about the recession? No? Good, keep spending and eating at restaurants!!  Greene House gets major props for the Mission/Arts & Crafts decor (my favorite as it embodies timeless warmth) and a very friendly server!! I ordered the pork tenderloin with penne (mac-n-cheese) and broccoli. The pork was masterfully cooked, the mac-n-cheese was okay and the broccoli was straight out of the bag I don't think it was cooked at all. The house BBQ sauce struck me as almost bitter and not very good, but my buddy just loved it. You know what they say about opinions..........  Kobe sliders were okay I thought, good fries, and my other two friends had the sweet potato cannelloni and veggie panini which I did not taste but they seemed to enjoy.  I'd probably go back to Greene House, patrons should check out the $100 gift card pack for Fox Restaurants at Costco for $80 to maximize your value.

Uh....you all are kidding, right?  I must have missed something when I visited Fez, as I was very underwhelmed.  True, it's very cosmopolitan and the atmosphere is very cool but to me the food was lackluster at best.  A restaurant with mediocre food is a mediocre restaurant. Maybe I'll just have to stick to drinkin' next time :)

I can't believe I didn't try Sierra Bonita sooner, it was just a great place to have lunch today!  You knew it was going to be good before you even got served anything because of the great attention to details.  Phenomenally clean, not so much as a stray tortilla chip on the floor.  And, this is probably just me, but the washroom has good smelling soap (I absolutely loathe when places use the cheap ass pink junk). The guacamole (though nine dollars) was quite good, it came accompanied by a trio of salsas which were also good.  I had citrus grilled chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables, my buddy had the five spice chicken sandwich with some nice crispy fries.  There was not a loser in the bunch, everything was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. I'll definitely go here again, though the steep prices make happy hour that much more appealing.  And $2 beers too!!  :)

While reading the free Glendale paper at a much-suckier restaurant I scoped a coupon for Bobby Q-$30 for two dinners, appetizer and dessert.  I figured what the heck, I've heard a lot of good things about this place, though I've been burned before it doesn't make me fear that fire :)  So me and a buddy went for some Q this past weekend. This place is actually a lot hipper and nicer than the...umm....kinda crap neighborhood would make you think it would be...the entrance is not really well marked, we thought they were closed because we couldn't get in!!  We could be dumb though... The brisket rolls were deep fried goodness, nothing wrong with that.  Chicken/rib combo was solid very moist, though I would have appreciated more smoke flavor.  And the spare ribs had that gristly-mini-bones-fatty-section action (though not unusual for untrimmed spare ribs)  The sauce and the sides (mashed potato and mac-n-cheese) were good and the portions are absolutely ENORMOUS!  I'm still eating their Q!!

Touch of Thai is probably the best I've found so far in the Valley.  Satay is the ultimate gauge of a Thai restaurant IMHO, if your satay sucks you've just tarnished my opinion of your entire establishment.  Is it fair?  Maybe so, maybe not but I got my standards!! Theirs is pretty good, their noodle dishes (pad see u, pad kee mau, etc,) are also good choices.  I am a big fan of spicy food and their menu does not disappoint in that regard when I specify that I like it HOT!!! Have fun!  And a Singha!

Very swank and the food is as good as the atmosphere!  While I'm not a fan of the raw stuff Yasu has plenty of other options.  I went with five friends and all were equally impressed with this restaurant. I found the service to be excellent, the waitress was very accomodating in answering the ad-nauseum questions from the annoying patrons behind me :)  They wouldn't be considered cheap, but hey-it's raw fish so I guess I gotta butch up sometimes...

I went with Melissa, Tiffany and Anthony today for lunch-what a cute little place!!  The food is pretty killer too, I had empanandas with onion rings and I cleaned my plate-really good very, very slight greasy on the end of the empanada, but others would have crested much sooner.  Usually I get to sample other dishes but my companions were fully content keeping everything for themselves at this place, a testament to the quality of food being offered.  Thusly the four star rating, I feel it has five star potential and will update if it is necessary!

Pita Jungle is pretty decent I've had their chicken shwarma plates every time I go.  It's pretty college-neo hippie-veggie-art on the walls is for sale-type of place.  Not to say that's a negative, just a weird vibe for me personally. Haji Baba is just down the street and personally that is more my speed and I think their hummus is better too.

I was pleasantly surprised when I visited Don Jose's, the food was actually pretty good!  My order was the carne asada plate, that and a bottle of Diet Coke was just over nine bucks, a little pricy I thought, but I grabbed some of their salsas and sat down.  My order arrived quickly and the portions were big, I left STUFFED and I couldn't even finish everything.  The beans were a little looser than I would have preferred but tasty nonetheless.  The carne asada was well seasoned, chopped up into chunks with no mystery gristly fat pieces.  Came with a good scoop of guacamole, rice, beans, and a steamin' bundle of tortillas.  My only gripe is that they don't give you chips to go with the salsas-you have to buy a bag. I enjoyed everything and would certainly return when I'm in the land of the blue hairs :)

This is a pretty good store, for Phoenix anyway.  Good variety of food from Asian cultures, but there's also a good selection of Eastern European goods which brings me to the one product that is alone worth a trip-LEPINA!! The lepina is a Balkan bread, and it is something that I just cannot leave this store without.  Poofy, yeasty, heaven.  You seriously need to try it!!

I'll give the 'economic kitchen' a round up on a 3.5 star review.   I happened by this place the other day and ordered a carne asada burrito.  Usually I gripe about no free chips and salsa at Mexican restaurants but I ponied up the extra dollar for some chips to enjoy at their free condiment bar.  A basket of warm tortilla chips came out a few moments later and I was lovin' life.  The salsa roja was really solid I only wish I wasn't so rushed as I would have liked to have tried the salsa verde.  The burrito was big and beefy (insert joke here) and quite tasty.  I'll definitely return to try some of their other dishes when I have the time to sit a spell!

JT's exceeded my expectations when I ordered the gyro plate the other day. Very generous portions and the plate is nice crispy fries (they know how to operate a deep fryer!!), gyro meat with griddled pita, rice and salad.  Really, this was enough food for two but I couldn't take the leftovers unfortunately.... The pita was just about perfect and the tzatziki was pretty solid as well.  I wouldn't say I was a fan of the salad, as it seemed there was no 'ette' in the vinaigrette (read ALL vinegar) but I'm sure it would be well received by others. I'll visit this shop again and determine whether they knock Chicago Gyros off the my-favorite-gyro-shop throne-and that is a very high standard!

I can't believe I've not written a review for Hobe before this.  Super helpful staff and products that set this shop apart.  Of note is an amazing selection of game meats, you'd be hard pressed to find this diverse array anywhere else in the Valley.  Their Prime steaks are just delicious. They also carry some sauces and marinades, my personal favorite is BBQPHX sauce!!

Yes, I came to Noodles Ranch for a rushed lunch a few weeks back.  It was really good and I wished I had more time to spend here. I ordered the cashew chicken curry lunch special with a Thai iced coffee.  Everything wasgood, again I had to go to the counter and pay before they could even bring me the check, but I was impressed with this place and I'll gladly return!

I cannot even believe how rude the man at the counter was today.  I had purchased a range card a number of years ago for this course for ten buckets at a discounted price, which never expired.  Four buckets had been redeemed on the card; I had some spare time so I headed up there to get in some practice. I went to the counter and said 'one large bucket please' and put my range card on the counter.  The man said that card is of no use to them.  I asked why, as there were still six buckets left to redeem.  He said they haven't taken those cards in over two years and that if I wanted a bucket it would be ten bucks. Now, I'm not looking for free stuff here-I paid for ten buckets and played four.  I said to the man 'so you're saying I'm screwed out of the rest of the money on the card?' and he told me 'yeah'.  Well, thanks so much for that!

This place is certainly worth a visit, and I live all the way in Moon Valley (North Phoenix)!!  Great atmosphere in the middle of a community based around a large garden/small farm with mature trees and a great patio surrounding this old (at least by AZ standards) building!! Food is pretty standard fare with burgers, sandwiches and deep fried goodies.  They do a pretty good job, few places do an awful job, but the spot is the draw here.

You know, I am with you Thomas. Everyone's looking for any relief possible from the ridiculous gas prices, you pull past the Arco and shriek "MY GOD!!! LOOK AT THOSE LOW RATES"  (as anyone from Chicago can hopefully appreciate :) So you pull in and whip out the debit card and oh-WTF??!?  You're gonna CHARGE me extra for using my debit card??  Well, haha, I got one over on you, hello Mileage Plus Visa...WTF YOU ONLY TAKE DEBIT!)(*#UR(NFP)G&_(@&$GFBIPU.  This is a very deceptive business practice, IMHO  Plus, they only authorize for fifty bucks and my frickin' ALTIMA was $75 last time to fill up so plan on visiting your local AM/PM for quite some time on your next fill up.  I only hope your surroundings are better than this sh!thole... Despite the low prices I'm afraid I will no longer patronize ANY Arco stations.

This is far and away the closest thing that I've found in Phoenix that rivals the great hot dog/gyro places back home (Windy City Gyros in Wrigleyville [on Broadway just south of Irving Park rd since someone asked]) would be the gold standard-it almost brings a tear to my eye just thinking about it...).   The gyros are very good, with solid tzatziki and pita.  Their Italian beef is also quite good piled high with giardinera.

OMFG, I would give this store six stars if I could!!  Awesome find in a city with an ethnic food profile that would be described as lackluster at best.  Plus this place is CHEAP.  They have filet mignon for less than six bucks a pound and they're pretty dang good!  Are they Ruth's Chris good, no-but for the price (or even twice the price) I doubt you'll be able to find better.  I sure haven't and I go all over the Valley to visit food stores. Produce, noodles, sauces, tea, spices, flour there's little you CAN'T find here!  I need to quit my job I think...LOL!

Looks like I have to agree with my friend Deb L.  I too wanted to like Yen since it's pretty close and I really got excited about all the positive reviews.  Though, sorry Deb-I don't mind cans of pop :) So, I have their spicy pork bento box and my buddy had a couple rolls.  The rolls were a disappointment I could tell, just not quite what she's used to.  She also complained about an immediate potty trip upon arriving home, despite my explaining it's impossible for food to travel through your digestive system in a half hour.... I had the spicy pork bento, I don't think I left quite as disappointed but I'd call the pork oily before I called it spicy.  The usual accompaniments (miso, salad, etc.) were pretty blah I thought.  And I do agree it's pricey especially considering the mostly abandoned strip mall location across from a Whataburger...

Yes, Pad C U twice in a week/???  I'm all up for it!! Usually I eat homemade lunch, but this week has seen my out and about with all sorts of work to do... So, I've been to the Tempe location of this restaurant and it rivaled Touch of Thai at Bell/35th Ave for my favorite Thai place in the Valley, though none have even come close to the places back in Chicago. Solid, solid, solid-you get a small salad as you sit down and I ordered Pad C U and a Thai iced coffee.  The coffee was sweeter than I remembered but the Pad C U was quite good.  More significant 'gravy' than Thai House in Scottsdale and just delicious.  Cheaper too even though they're downtown!

Okay, judging a Vietnamese restaurant on the decor is a little jaded IMHO.  Ambience is certainly a factor when dining, and if that's your most pressing criteria you're probably not fit to go into most Vietnamese places. Pholicious does a great job with their food-went their for lunch over the weekend and tried their oxtail pho which was very good.  My buddy had chicken & vegetable chow fun which was also delicious.  Sizable portions and the most unique serving of Thai iced coffee I think I've ever had.  Almost like a half old time Italian espresso pot on top of a coffee cup that holds the coffee and condensed milk.  You're supposed to stir this then add the contents to the accompanying glass of ice.  Unlike dummy me who just dumped it in the ice :)

I frequently shop at the great Lee Lee market and have often eyed this restaurant, I thankfully had some time while waiting for some watch batteries to be replaced at the adjacent jewelers to eat lunch at Hop Kee. Now, first off I am (as they say) a woman with certain endowments who should know better than to wear a white shirt to an Asian restaurant but I really did not plan it out correctly...usually this ruins my experience 'cuz I'm such a dummy but not this time. Singapore noodles are sort of a hard dish-it's either oily and flavorless flourescent yellow with shoe-leather pork or an incredible marriage of char siu and curry.  Hop Kee was certainly leaning toward the latter.  I really liked this dish, so much so I wore some home without shame!!

We had just the best time at Arrowhead Grill, a group of us went for happy hour the other day.  It was my anniversary (17 years WOO HOO :) so we decided it was okay to go to a place we didn't have a coupon for LOL! The bar doesn't have a happy hour menu per se, but you do get some discounts and can order anything you wish off the regular menu too. We tried the crab cake (just superb), filet sliders, prime rib sandwich, shrimp cocktail, pig wings (roasted mini pork shanks), and chicken tacos.  The tacos had a bit of a fake smokiness added to them and they were the only thing I wouldn't order again.  Good beer and wine selections of course!!

Three words for you-EAT AT FLOYD'S!!  You'd almost be stupid not to :)   Seriously, I went for lunch and it was hard to find much that was more than six dollars.  So, my expectations weren't very high for my Cajun Chicken sandwich.  I'm figuring flimsy thin chicken strips straight out of the Tyson bag with a little season salt.  I was very, very wrong-there was a generous portion of real white meat very nicely cooked topped with bacon, cheese and chipotle mayo!  Side salad too!!  WOW!!  I almost felt like I was stealing, the sandwich, salad, drink and a more than 20% tip to the wonderful server was just over ten bucks.  You cannot beat that. As previous reviewers have noted it's just two guys whose dream it was to open a restaurant with good, home cooked food.  A dream I can really get behind, hope you do too!! Anytime you're wondering where to eat around Paradise Valley Mall, skip the yukky chains and support these local guys instead.  You won't be sorry!!

WOW is all I can say too!!  When I saw the bill...even with a $25 GC it was $100 for four people to eat here!  There was two beers (and you know how places only fill a tap beer about 2/3 full?  That is this kind of place) and two glasses of house wine (likewise chintzy on quantity), two appetizers and three entrees. I do have to give major props on most of the food, the yellow chicken curry and pad see u (sp??) were quite good, also ordered Lard Nar which was lackluster at best.  Satay was solid, their version of crab rangoons were completely cream-cheesy I didn't taste one sliver of crab in them. Bottom line is although they had some food that was pretty, even very good, I'd likely not return simply due to the high prices. Go to Taste of Thai on Bell/35th Ave and you'll walk away full in the stomach and full in the wallet  Grasshopper :)

This is my favorite Rosati's location as you can dine in and the pizza is SOOOO much better fresh from the oven!!  I have only ordered the thin crust and probably will never venture elsewhere on the menu because it's so dang good!!  Just like the Rosati's chains back in Chicago except for my absolute favorite location has an all-you-can-eat lunch buffet!!  Then again, maybe it's a good thing they don't have that here....  :) Their prices are not cheap, and they get dinged one star for that.

I'll throw in a positive review for this store, the people are just great and that's a good part of the experience.  This is not a retail store per se, they do have some frozen items for sale and offer fresh product on certain days, but for the most part I get the impression you can order what you want and pickup when they promise.  I'd probably try to call first if you're not in the area. If you're looking to cook local and support the community (and get as fresh as possible) this store is one you want to visit.   This store is not cheap, however-be prepared to pay about triple what you would at the big groceries.

I'm afraid I'm going to have to downgrade my prior review as I've been disappointed the past couple times I've purchased from the Meat Shop.  The staff is still great, very helpful, but the product has let me down.   First it was pork belly, the quality was not good-much fattier than my normal Asian market source but I figured homemade bacon's kind of a tough standard to judge quality as it's smoked and cured.  I then did a head-to-head with spare ribs and the ones from the Meat Shop were thin and tough while the ones I got at Smart & Final were meaty and juicy. I suppose if I better express what I'm looking for I might get better results but just because I don't that shouldn't mean I get crap, especially for triple/quadruple the price of the regular grocery store.

Anne, I can't even imagine I visited the same place as you did-I found them very friendly and my lunch was just great today.  Though I'll give you the 'Panini' moniker is misleading, and the pita is likely not what most people are used to.  This place is definitley worth a visit though!!  I recently found out my favorite lepinja bread at Asiana Market (43rd Ave/Union Hills) was baked here, and I was counting the milliseconds until I could visit this place.  Seriously-best bread I have EVER eaten and I've eaten LOTS of bread.  It is a pillow of wonderfulness reserved only for the most discriminating carbo-holics :)  So, me and a buddy split the small beef sausage sandwich with the above mentioned killer bread, onions and a buttery/creamy condiment spread.  We are both foodies (though Bosnian food wouldn't be something we'd call familiar) and we couldn't quite nail down what this was.  Except darn tasty!  I'd call a mix between whipped butter and sour cream?  HELLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO!??!?!   I can't imagine a person actually being able to eat the whole thing by themselves, but we both loved our lunch-and a $5 price tag makes it even more appealing.  I will DEFINITELY be back.  They get the five-star fame just for their awesome bread!  Please bury me with a coffin full when I'm dead :)

Now, I'm probably not the best person to review a sushi place as I'm not a fan of the raw stuff.  Kawaii has all the bases covered though-my Yaki Soba was quite good and my friends really enjoyed the Philly rolls and spicy tuna.  The restaurant is decorated very nicely and the staff is attentive and helpful.  Too swank for being next to a Wal Mart store :) I'd go back to Kawaii, a sure sign of an enjoyable experience.

Another sign of a good restaurant with multiple locations is that one is as good as the next-certainly true with Chicago Gyros!  i had gyros, I couldn't resist, these are about the best you'll find in the Valley.  I've been all around and I'm always delighted to find another Chicago Gyros store for lunch!!

This was a pretty good lunch, I had the Lil C of two drumsticks and mac-n-cheese for six dollars.  I thought the price was a bit steep, but everybody's got to make a buck right?  Given this is 'the' spot for this type of food they can pretty much command their price. So I placed my order and hit the rest room to wash my hands, by the time I returned to my table the food had already been delivered!  The chicken was pipin' hot, very crispy and juicy.  The mac-n-cheese was good, not great though.  My expectations were extremely high however given the number of Yelpers who specifically pointed out this dish as gastronomic nirvana. Should I be in the area I'd return to Lo Lo's and try some other dishes.

Yes, I'm indeed a fan-best pho so far in Phoenix.  Yes, it's over 100 outside, but pho has a special place in my heart/stomach (and it seemed very popular with the other diners as well). I went this afternoon with three of my buddies and was lucky enough to sample a number of dishes.  First, I should say this place was VERY busy even at 11:30 on a Sunday.  The spring rolls and egg rolls were great, as was my pho tai and my buddy's lemongrass chicken. Service was a little slow but really-this place was PACKED.  Mostly with Asian people, a good sign. I never dined at Pho Bang, but I will certainly return to this restaurant as it's hands down the best Vietnamese spot I've tried in the Valley.

I met up the other day with my two good buddies for lunch, and thanks to yelp we all really enjoyed our visit to Fresh Wasabi. I should probably offer a disclaimer that I'm not a huge sushi fan but I very much enjoy Japanese food otherwise.  We all ordered bento boxes, which were quite generous for the $8.95 price.  There was miso (good), tempura (good), salad (very good), california roll, rice and mine was chicken katsu which was quite good.   Good food and friendly service make this a solid bet, especially in Surprise.

3.5* I've been to Bluewater a couple times now, and I've had some great food and some that's been so-so.  Our first visit I had the pan seared scallops and my buddy had the miso salmon.  We both really enjoyed our meals, not to mention killer oysters rockefeller and sourdough bread! Our last visit (in addition to the aforementioned oysters and sourdough of course) I tried the prawn and scallop skewer and my buddy tried the chinook.  Now, to me anyway, prawn=BIG shrimp U-15 like. But alas, these were more akin to 21-25.  The food was not hot when I got it which definitely detracted from the dish.  The chinook was average. So, in closing I'd say oysters, chowder and bread will probably be my next meal at Bluewater, never been disappointed in those.

I got very, very sick after eating here with some friends-I would have to blame the Diet Coke as that was the only thing different that I had (and it did taste a bit moldy, didn't drink much of it)  My friends thankfully were spared the disease. We all had chicken salads and they were nothing special but I'll likely not return due to me heaving my guts out the night before a flight to Chicago.............. Now, as a Maricopa Cty. certified food handler I know that food poisioning can take up to three days to manifest and you may not know 100% the cause of your gastro-intestinal distress.  But as I was walking to my truck after lunch my stomach was already churning and burning....

I just got home getting my latest ink with Chris and I really could not be more pleased.  Chris worked on a tattoo for me about two years ago when he worked at another shop, when it came time again I followed him over to Inkenstein. The shop is a little off the beaten path but really nicely appointed and very welcoming.  My previous tattoo was probably one that most artists merely tolerate-simple script which I provided so zero creativity.  This tattoo I gave Chris an idea of what I liked and didn't like and gave him creative license.  He exceeded my expectations and my tattoo looks better than I even imagined. Inkenstein has built a solid reputation and it is very well deserved.  There is certainly no shortage of tattoo shops, especially in downtown Glendale, there's good reason this place is number one.

I am having major problems with my deck which Arizona Creative renovated back in 7-13.  I originally contacted AZ Creative as my old kool decking was chipping off in several spots which was diagnosed as efflorescing of the concrete underneath and it was very evident in several areas of the deck.  I was told that the concrete would be ground down but there would be a possibility the chipping may return.  I did a lot of research when exploring options for the deck renovation and heard very good things about this company and the bullet-proof product that they installed.  I trusted the experience behind the evaluation and that it certainly wouldn't make sense to install a coating over a deficient substrate. Less than two years later the chipping had indeed returned, and in fact had worsened, which Arizona Creative was nice enough to repair under warranty.  Now, we're at 2 1/2 years and my deck looks worse than ever with several large areas peeling off.  Had I been properly advised that it wasn't 'possible' the chipping would return, rather that it was certain to return, I would never have spent $7000 on what ultimately turned out to be a band-aid with a two year shelf life. Regardless, I need a solution-a permanent solution.  The company is not returning emails or voice mails.

I had Performance Muffler install a Stillen catback on my Titan and I couldn't be happier with the experience (and the end product!).  Very reasonably priced as well. If you need a custom exhaust or have a problem with your stock system, go see Russ.  He's got all the top brands and is a very skilled tech.

Let me say first that I absolutely adore a good cheeseburger and fries.  Sadly, I do try to resist them because they're not the best for you but, sometimes it's impossible to avoid this temptation. So, I had a major moment of weakness and found myself starving after a trip to Target-Five Guys!  All their accolades and awards made me very hopeful that I'd soon enjoy a pipin' hot, crispy, salty bag of french fry heaven and a juicy flavorful cheeseburger. Unfortunately, they dissappointed big time on both factors.  The fries were room temperature at best and, frankly, mushy.  I did not find one fry in the bag that offered any resistance to the tooth.  I ended up throwing away basically all of them.  The burger was okay I guess, not very juicy and really-would it kill you to put on at least salt and pepper??   I can't see this place lasting long especially with places like Delux around, hell even Wendy's has better burgers IMHO.

Yes, fellow Yelpers it only took EIGHT YEARS but I finally found a place in the Valley that rivals the Thai spots back in Chicago!   Now, this is not an upscale place, they're trying to do the best they can with this location, but it's really a bad spot.  There's been so many restaurants in and out of this space in a rather dumpy strip mall I can only pray this one makes it as this is the best Thai we've found in Arizona. Started off with chicken satay and hot & sour soup.  The satay was quite good though dark meat and unskewered, with killer peanut sauce.  The hot & sour soup was good, though my buddy said it needed more sour to it.   I ordered my favorite Pad CU and it was sublime.  My buddy's Pad Kee Mao was also fantastic we were stuffed when we left with our take-away boxes (YAY!! Thai for lunch tomorrow!!). All that and two Diet Cokes came out to $27...with the $10 Restaurant.com coupon we felt like we were stealing... We told our very friendly server that the restaurant reminded us of the Chicago Thai spots and she said her husband was the cook and he's from Chicago.

I've been back several times since my initial review and this place just keeps impressing.  I've brought a bunch of my friends (which, bonus for me, allows me to taste even MORE dishes!!) and everything I've tried has been just great.  Their sushi is simple but delicious and fresh, soups are excellent, noodle dishes are hard to beat, and the staff is always friendly. The lone(albeit tiny) gripe I have is with the Mongolian beef-I ordered this as part of their $3.95 lunch special menu and I'd probably call it Mongolian onions more than Mongolian beef.  What do you want for four bucks though... I've not tried any dish here that wasn't delicious!!

So I arrived at Rocket at noon totally in the mood for a greasy spoon type lunch and this place hit the mark.  I've passed by a number of times with the promise of the Latina Meat Market which never opened or closed before I had the chance to go in. Anyhoo, I ordered a double cheeseburger with fries and a can of Diet Coke.  It took a little bit even though I was one of four patrons in the restaurant, but I'll accept that in that it means they cook your meal to order.  Good thin patty burger and thin natural cut fries, though the bun was a bit large.  I'm not a big exotic soda pop fan, but as previously noted if you are they've got probably 6-8 big coolers worth of everything from cream soda to energy drinks to regional colas. The only issue I had with this place hit about 12:15 when a swarm of teenagers descended upon the restaurant and all of a sudden it's completely packed and noisy as all hell.  Guess the adjacent Moon Valley High isn't a closed campus...

My God, you better come hungry to this place-not only is the food good but the portions were absolutely enormous when I visited.   I had the gyro plate and it came with about a pound of gyro meat, three cups of Basmati rice and a unique bread underneath.  Not soft and poofy like a pita or naan bread, it was thinner with a crispness to the crust.  I like to consider myself a world bread conniseur (SP??) but I've not had anything like this before. All in all, a good visit and I'd happily come back to try some of their other dishes.

Like other Yelpers I recall seeing this place on Triple D and wanted to try but I am a North Phoenix resident who never makes it to the Tuke.  Good thing they took over the old San Gabriel or whatever the hell it was before. I enjoyed the carne asada tacos, good salsa, good rice & beans though I can't say I was really feelin' the value factor as much as I would have liked.  I cleaned the plate and probably could have eaten more, though I did skip breakfast and ended up at Los Taquitos about 2 p.m. :) I'll be seeing you again Los taquitos!

I'll go generous on my 3.5 stars for Leo's.  The staff is super friendly and the restaurant is spotless.  I ordered the Kalua pig plate lunch and found the rice to be, well, plain rice as it should be and the macaroni salad was also good and simple as it should be. Now, I've had the real deal when visiting Hawaii-whole hog lathered with salt and wrapped in banana leaves cooked in an imu (big hole in the ground).  I think the county health dept. would take issue with that cooking method, so I'm not going to fault Leo's for that :)  But at least IMHO the pork needed more salt-it was tender with a hint of smoke but was underseasoned.  And Kalua Pig should make me retain water just lookin' at it!!  My opinion, if you think L&L's is too salty you might enjoy Leo's. All in all I will return and try some of their other dishes.

Another jewel in the Fox crown-read amazing look and feel but outrageous prices for food that's really nothing special.  A few of us went to lunch the other day and one of my buddies orders the prime rib french dip.  The server asks if they would like mushrooms, peppers or onions to which my friend replied yes, please.  They were kind enough to charge $2 EACH for said add-ons so $6 total additional charge.  I mean seriously, I can get ten pounds of onions for two dollars... I ended up splitting a chicken club and a ~1 oz. cheese 'plate' with a friend and we both got iced tea.  $24...to top it off the waiter was kind of a dick. I probably would never patronize a Fox restaurant again if I didn't get hooked up with gift cards on occasion.

I would seriously give this place six stars if I could.  The shop is spotless, the people could not be more helpful, and the products are truly second to none (not to mention the prices are very competitive).  They dry age Angus beef in house and are probably the only Certified Angus Beef store in the area.  The dry aged strips I cooked a few weeks back were just superb, and I've cooked plenty of Prime, Wagyu, and 'Kobe' steaks over the years. They will also special order things for you if you've got a special occasion. I really cannot recommend this place highly enough! p.s. they also have BBQPHX sauce, which that alone is worth a visit!!

It pains me to have to write a two star review for a new restaurant.  Lord knows anyone who dares open a restaurant these days has a lot of challenges, but I can't recommend this new Vietnamese spot simply based on the food. The restaurant looks great, and the staff was very friendly but unfortunately that's where the positives end.  I came in the other day and ordered a small pho tai which should be the signature dish of a Vietnamese restaurant.  I found their prices to be a bit high, but I figured what the heck-it's so much fancier than the Vietnamese places that I frequent.  I noticed the chef pouring pho bowls while I was waiting and the broth was barely brown...maybe it's pho ga I thought...regrettably, my suspicions were confirmed when I finally got my beige pho tai. Pho broth is the holy grail IMHO, with it's deep beefy flavor combined with the sucker punch of star anise, clove and cinammon-it's probably the most soul nourishing dish that I've experienced when done well.  Pho & Grill's version was completely lackluster and even the additions of the Thai Basil, cilantro and a healthy dose of Sriracha couldn't rescue it.

I am acquainted with Scott and Bekke (and Travis) from the BBQ competitions here in AZ so I was anxious to try their new place.  Being that they trounced just about everyone, including my team, I was really wondering what style they'd be serving.  The meat is very true to Texas style, simply seasoned and perfectly smoked.   You can tell that great care went into the preparation of the meat, and great BBQ is ALL about the 24 hours prior to the meat hitting your plate. I cannot recommend this spot highly enough, the first real step to putting Arizona on the Q map.
