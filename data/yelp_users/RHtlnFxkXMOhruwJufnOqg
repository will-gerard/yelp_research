I was in search of a new vet to take my American PItbull Terrier (Lucy) to.  The last doctor we took her to (because of a constant limp) suggested ACL surgery one visit, then the next said there was no way it could be her ACL.  We were not going to take her back there.  I found Cochise Animal Hospital on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  It is a cute little facility with a very calm, cute hospital cat.  We didn't wait very long for assistance and the nice woman who saw Lucy suggested a natural healing approach rather than charging us for unneeded x-rays.  We were very thankful for her honesty and recommendation.  Lucy is feeling better now and we will be taking her back for all her doggy health needs!

After just ok and so/so experiences with former stylists, I decided to ask a few friends for a referral.  My good friend- with great hair- recommended Leona at Shampoo Ink.  I've been seeing her for almost a year now and I've never been more happy with a stylist!  My hair used to never grow past a certain length (probably from being over processed).  Since I've been seeing Leona my hair has FINALLY been healthy enough to grow and has never felt more full and happy!  Leona is incredibly sweet and a great listener.  She always points me in the right direction with color and toner and is wonderfully consistent with her cuts (a slight trim really is just a slight trim- she won't chop your long locks off!!)  Not to mention her blowouts are out of this world!  The salon is adorable and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming.  I am one happy client! :)

We are regulars here.  Love the convenience of having a Barro's near us!  Great pitcher deals and we love the wings.

This is my closest Verizon store (I realize it's a franchise but still). We've gone here a few times and the service has always been good, but this last time it was excellent!  My dinosaur iPhone4 took it's final spill and it was time for me to upgrade.  Levi helped me right away, found a great upgrade deal for me and explained the entire process very well.  He was also very appreciate of my patience since the store was busy.  He was also very friendly and energetic even though it was at the end of Cyber Monday and he must have been tired!  Thanks, Levi!

I was overcharged on my bundle purchase at this store three weeks ago. I brought it to their attention and the store has done nothing to correct the situation. I spoke to many employees about the matter, including the manager. To make matters worse, the store keeps giving me the run-around and I am still waiting for a resolution three weeks later.    Do not purchase from this store- take your money to an actual Verizon store.

Janet was referred to me by a friend who had her bridesmaids dress altered.  She was able to get me in quickly and her place is darling.  She is bubbly, friendly and extremely professional!  She hemmed my floor length gown so that it falls to the ground perfectly as well as made the dress fit like a dream.   Her prices are also very reasonable and her customer service is outstanding!  I'm a soon-to-be bride myself and will absolutely be taking my dress to Janet for any alterations as well as referring my own bridesmaids.  She was even kind enough to recommend some bridal salons in the area, which I will be visiting soon!  I highly recommend Janet to all bridesmaids and brides!

Friendly service and my tan looked great for my trip to Vegas.  I'd definitely go again!

Terrible.  The only reason we actually use these people is because our landlord has us call them.  The "customer service" girls on the phone are always VERY rude and have a bad attitude- they are not helpful at all.  Service is rarely available for anyone that works a normal job schedule and they take forever to order the actual parts you need and get them fixed once you actually get them there.  The last service guy came much later than he said he would be there then had gave me major attitude when I told him I had already left the home for the day (I can't sit around and hope someone would turn up two hours after my wait window is up).  All in all- take your business elsewhere and save yourself frustration and a bad experience.

Great happy hour in a great location!  Perfect for drinks before a game with friends.
