There aren't many Mexican buffet restaurants in phoenix. Maybe because Mexican food is best served fresh. I remember the 1st time my boyfriend took me to Panchos; he remembered eating there when he was younger & wanted to go back.  The salsa isn't very good; it's bland for a Mexican place. We have gone back many times and I must admit that it has gotten worse & worse every time. The food selection has gotten worse & the price higher. We also saw them on the dirty dinning report & they got a horrible rating and neither of us was surprised. It's sad, such a great Idea & good location could have done allot better!

Not many menu choices but we both ordered the chicken fried steak & could have shared one plate. We both had half our plates left over. That would have been nice to know ahead of time. The bread they serve before dinner is ok; it kept the kids occupied until the food came. The food we ordered was ok but I don't think we will be back. Slow waiter service as well.

We first went to the Avondale location many years ago and the food was great. I worked on 16th Street & Indian School at the time so the Thomas location made sense to stop in for dinner after work. We have also dined at the Scottsdale location & all three are great!!  The food is always fresh, the macaroni salad is great & it comes on a bed of steamed cabbage. The Chicken Katsu is delicious, tender & juicy on the inside & crunchy on the outside. We also love that the portion sizes are large enough to share with our kids not having to order additional meals.  Love Ono & always stop when in the area!

Casino Arizona is a fun clean casino with a great selection of games. We have gone to just about every casino in the Phoenix area & like this one the best. Casino War is our favorite game to play, the table is always packed, but we always manage to get our lucky seats right next to each other. More times than not we walk away winners, either way, being with someone you love makes a great night! The cocktail waitresses keep the drinks flowing and most of the dealers are friendly. The snack bar is good but the buffet is delicious! My boyfriend absolutely loves buffets due to the options and variety and theirs doesn't disappoint at all. They have an ok dance floor that has live bands on the weekends; it's typically full of the "casino groupies" and old men trying to score one, LOL! My only complaint is the smoking, we don't smoke, it a nasty habit & hate sitting next to someone chain smoking at the table.  We take family & friends here on occasion but usually it's a late night / early morning after date spot!

My boyfriend & I love Greek food, always have. There are many Greek places in Phoenix so it's hard to find a good one. Greek Wraps is on the top of our list, Chicken Kabob Plate is seasoned well, although there have been a couple times when it was a little dry. Their rice is probably the best Greek rice I have ever had, I love the soft, fresh pita bread & the garlic sauce wraps it all together. The hummus is ok, not the best, not the worse but then again I love tomato basil hummus versus plain. The Chicken Kabob wrap with Caesar dressing is also amongst my favorite things to order here. My boyfriend loves the Greek Salad but always orders extra Feta cheese. They are always busy and the food is always fresh!

Our first time coming here was about 8 years ago when we lived on 19th Ave & Dunlap; we liked it then & still do now. It's a smaller place located in a strip mall, you could drive by and never notice it. The chips and salsa are always fresh, the beans and rice are good. My boyfriend likes the green chicken enchiladas and I have gotten a variety of things all turned out good. I once ordered the taquitos and they were over cooked but besides that no complaints. They also sell bottled Mexican sodas and frescas that he loves to order instead of a fountain drink.

We love going to Zia Records. They have a great selection of music, movies & now books too! We always go here when we are looking for something & have always had great luck finding it. The store can be a bit overwhelming at first but the staff is very friendly with helping you look up & locate an item. It's also a great place to trade in your old stuff for cash or credit towards something new or at least new to you. They have a $1 bin of children's books and I always find some good books for my boys! The novelty area of the store is pretty cool as well. They have lots of unique items that I have never seen anywhere else. LOVE ZIA!!

From the outside you might be unsure about going in to eat, but please do. This is an amazing little market/ deli/ restaurant all rolled into one. The store is very user friendly & is easy to find items you are looking for, if for some reason you can't find it the staff is more than willing to help & give suggestions if needed. The deli is great, good fresh bread & meat. I love the dressing they put on the sandwiches. The pastas, hot or cold are great as well. It's fast and easy to get in and out if you are in a hurry.

I love Olive Garden, I love their salad & bread sticks. My boyfriend took me here on one of our 1st dates years ago & it became a place we eat at frequently. We both love the chicken Alfredo & the fresh grated parmesan cheese they top it with. When they have the never ending pasta bowl special he likes to go & get spaghetti & meatballs or sausage. For a big chain place its ok, I know it's not "real" Italian, but it's still good.

Wow, the food here is so good and very cheap. Our Family ate here under $20 and had so much food left over. Plan on waiting a little bit for your food as everything is cooked fresh as you order it. But it is definitely worth the wait. Everything we ordered was delicious. We asked the owner / waiter what to recommend & tried a variety of items. The tamales & beans we the best restaurant tamales I have ever had, they will keep us going back for more!

I love their wings, the pizza is ok, they do have an ok amount of TVs to watch & have little sound boxes you can put on your table so you can hear the TV (assuming the music isn't blaring). Not our favorite sports bar place but we stop in every once in a while.

Our La Perla experience started off with the fear of being shot during the vatos altercation in the Fiesta Room that carried out into the parking lot. Our debate to stay or not weighed heavily on the BOGO coupon we had.  I ordered the chicken chimi "regular" size, the chicken was good but I didn't care for the red sauce they topped it with. The beans were very runny and the rice didn't have much flavor. My boyfriend ordered the carne asada plate, the meat was a little bland but otherwise ok. He also didn't like the beans. The food wasn't horrible but wasn't good either. Sorry La Perla, we won't be a return customer!

I am very pleased with Phoenix Pediatric Dental. I have been taking our 4yr old here for a couple years & I started taking our 1yr old as well. The office is very clean & completely caters to kids. The staff is great, very professional and amazing with our boys. Their scheduling department is wonderful & always calls you if they have a sooner appointment to see if you would like it. I'm very happy I found Phoenix Pediatric Dental and recommend them to anyone I know.

Dave & Busters is a fun place that my boyfriend and I have been going to for many years, (back when it was Jillian's) and always have a good time. The games are fun, the bowling alley is cool, the drinks are good I mean what's not to like. I will admit the food is not the best but it's a game place so who really goes there to eat? They change the games every so often to keep up to date & I love the "casino" feeling games where you win tickets when you push tokens over the edge. How funny it is to sit and watch grown adults so into games!  Its even fun to take the kids with us sometimes (shhh don't tell them we go by ourselves on 1/2 price game day!) our 4yr old is at the age where he really gets into some of the games. We take family here when they come in town for a fun night as well.  Dave & Buster's gets 4 stars in my book, really no complaints here.

We used to eat here all the time but haven't in a little while so we decided to stop in the other night. I must say, Golden Corral has made a couple changes in the right direction. They have a few new menu items including a pasta bar with different sauces (which were all pretty good) my boyfriend especially liked the spicy Alfredo sauce, at the fresh seafood bar they will make some delicious shrimp to go with it. They also added a chocolate Fondue fountain that we all loved. They don't bring you baskets of their delicious bread anymore but it's all self-serve so it's almost better, you can grab a fresh warm roll as you want one. My boyfriend and I love sweet tea & theirs is pretty good. All in all we were pretty impressed and have gone twice in the last week.

The Place has good food, cheap prices & is always packed. I'm happy they moved across 51st Ave into a bigger restaurant because you almost always had to wait for a table before. Their biscuits are so good, homemade, fresh & fluffy. It's not my favorite breakfast joint but it's still good.

I have only tried this place once. My boyfriend and I saw it on the food network channel DDD so we decided to give it a try. Our food was ok, nothing fabulous but not bad either. There were a lot of flys inside, the beans were very watery, the meat on the torta had good flavor but was missing "something". We might give it another try, maybe we didnt order the right thing.

We have been here so many times but I have yet to find a favorite dish. Don't get me wrong, I have never gotten anything that wasn't good, but it wasn't OMG great either. My boyfriend loves the pastrami or the turkey sandwiches & the chicken soup.  If the kids are with us we normally let them pick out a treat from the bakery. Chompies is a good place to go if you're in the area!

My boyfriend & I are both fans of BBQ. He is especially picky but I can understand because his Dad makes the best BBQ and homemade sauce I have ever had. That being said, Papa Joe's is delicious. We have never had a bad experience and have been coming here for a while. The pulled pork or pulled chicken are my personal favorites. If you go later in the day there is a good chance the pulled pork will be gone, that's a good sign in my book. He normally gets the ribs & has never complained. Their fried okra is good as well the batter has the perfect spices in it.  I have suggested Papa Joe's to several friends; its small & the people are friendly!

My boyfriend and I wanted to try someplace new. We have drove by Scramble several times so on this particular morning after we took the kids to daycare we stopped in for breakfast. It's nice and clean inside, you walk in to read a big menu and place your order at the counter. They give you a number to put on your table and the waitress brings your food out.  Both of our food was good, will be back to try different items.

This was my first time eating at Pho Thanh as well as my 1st time eating Vietnamese food. The restaurant is small and most of the tables were full so that's a good sign.  I was pleasantly surprised with our food & dining experience. I was not sure what to order so my boyfriend helped me pick something since he has eaten Vietnamese before. I ordered the lemongrass chicken; it was a little spicy but not over powering. He ordered some Pho, a pork sandwich and some spring rolls, all of which were good as well. We are both excited to go back and try some different items.

We love Jimmy Johns and are so excited they are finally expanding. That being said, we love this location on Mill. They are open till 4am on Friday nights so we typically hit em up either coming or going from the casino. Walking along mill and going into the shops is fun, there are a lot of restaurants we like but JJ is fast & cheap! The bread is delicious & I love the vinaigrette they put on their sandwiches. Thanks JJ for opening this location!

We came here for a date night dinner a while back and it didn't disappoint at all. The food was amazing, the steak was delicious and however they season the potatoes is to die for. It was a little on the expensive side but the food, service and atmosphere were great. We have been and will continue to go back!

My boyfriend stopped in here after lunch last week, it was a typical hot AZ summer day and we were both in the mood for something cool. We love downtown Glendale and all the little shops so we decided to stop in for a cool treat. Cute little shop, nice staff, good ice cream, what else can you ask for!

LOVE going to the drive-inns with the family. Such a great deal, $6.50 for adults & kids under 5 are free. You can bring your own food & drinks in without having to smuggle them in. They do have a snack bar with a good selection of food & snacks that are decently priced. For $6.50 you can watch 3 movies. The 1st one starts around 7:30 (a little later in the summer) and there are 2 showings after that. The kids normally pass out towards the end of the 1st movie, then Mommy & Daddy can relax and watch another movie together.  Tonight we watched Kung Fu Panda 2 and our 2nd movie is about to start. Great times, I love my man!

My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch today before taking our boys to the water park. Rocket Burger is one of our favorite places to stop in to eat or just grab a couple of the MANY bottle sodas they sell. Upon walking in we immediately noticed they did a little re-model and moved the kitchen area back so it opens up the dining area a little. I also noticed it was a lot quieter & cooler inside. They also put a wall up that they are going to be selling some of their sodas by the 4 or 6 pack. My BF was excited to hear that so now we can stock up on some of his favorites at home.  Like I said, we have been here many times but this time I tried the Afterburner Burger & OMG was it good! It had just the right amount of hot flavor but not too much to where you couldn't eat & enjoy it. He got a Bacon Rocket Burger that was good as well. We always get the chili cheese fries with the chili on the side & like always they were delicious!  Don't be discouraged by the location or outside appearance of Rocket Burger, it's a small family business ran by nice people who serve good food!

They have great tacos & happy hour prices. $2 tacos, who wouldn't love that, we saw this on DD&D and decided to give it a try, we took family here from out of town & they loved it as well. Small place but good food & friendly service!

Our favorite Hawaiian BBQ place is not close to home, that being said we were so excited to see that Leo's Island BBQ opened up. The food is great and always fresh, a family favorite for sure. I normally order the chicken katsu and my boyfriend likes the chicken/ seafood mix with chicken, fish & fried shrimp. The macaroni salad is great, fresh & creamy just how it should be. The staff is super friendly. Long story short, we love Leo's Island BBQ; hope they are around for a long time!

We have gone here twice now. Once after they first opened & then again tonight. The food was good, no complaints. I ordered a chicken burrito; my boyfriend ordered the 3 carne asada taco plate. Both were great, I think he ate half of my burrito but that's nothing new! The chips and salsa are delicious and the margaritas are Yummy! We used to eat at the original Popo's on Indian school when I was growing up so my family was excited to see this one open on our side of town. Good food, reasonable prices. We will be back!

Driving by this place several times I have never stopped, that is until yelp came along! We looked this place up on yelp and they get great reviews so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try for lunch one day and man am I happy we did!! The carne asada tacos are great; I also ordered a chicken tostada that was delicious. My boyfriend ordered a fish taco, carne asada burrito and a molote (masa fritter with potato and chorizo) all of them were great. The price is cheap & the food is fresh. It's small inside and gets a little warm on a hot summer day but it's still worth it. Don't be put off by the outside appearance & give Tacos Atoyac a try!

We love Greek food & we're always open to trying a new place. Good Fellas definitely didn't let us down. The owner greeted us when we walked in & asked if it was our 1st time there. He asked what we like & suggested a couple items. My boyfriend ordered the 3 meat plate that comes with steak, chicken, ground beef & rice. I ordered the 2 meat plate that comes with chicken, ground beef & rice. Both meals came with fresh pita bread & some sauce. The owner was very nice & gave us 2 bowls of chicken curry potato soup to try on the house. Neither of us has had Greek soup before & wow was it great! I had no idea what I was missing. All of the meats were delicious, perfectly cooked & seasoned. I was a little leery about the ground beef but it didn't disappoint, it was great as well.  Overall we were very pleasantly surprised and will definitely be back again.   They also have a check in coupon so it saves you 20% off an entrée plate. I hope they get a lot of business so they stay open and we can dine often!

The summers here in AZ are hot so my boyfriend and I were so happy to see that they opened another indoor range on this side of town. The staff is friendly & very helpful. Fridays are ladies nights, so we drop our kids off with the sitter & start the night off emptying a few clips! It's loud inside the range for our 4yr old & they don't let kids under 4 inside for safety reasons. They have a good selection of handguns & rifles to rent if you don't bring your own. Bringing your own stuff & renting the lane is the cheapest way to go. Otherwise, if you rent their equipment, you have to buy their ammo as well. They have some good targets but we bought some awesome ones online for way cheap! If you're looking to purchase a new weapon & want a chance to shoot different ones before you purchase one, shooters world is great!
