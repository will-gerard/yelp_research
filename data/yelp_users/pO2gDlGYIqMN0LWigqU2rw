If you've never been to bobby q's you have to try their baby back ribs. They are the best fall off the bone baby back ribs I've ever had!!! The cornbread and donuts are to die for.

Their customer service was excellent but the baby back ribs were horrible. I still think bobby q's has the best fall off the bone ribs.

I have a new favorite restaurant!!! The staff was friendly their service was fast. I ordered their ribeye and asked for medium well and that is exactly what they gave me. Perfectly cooked outside with a tender juicy center. So in other words the ribeye was cooked to perfection I am extremely satisfied. I will be coming back soon  Ps they have an awesome beer and wine selection
