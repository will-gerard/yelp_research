Food is tasty but portions are small. This sure ain't no burger king, Can't have it your way right away! LoL  Tried to add cheese and tomatoes and they said sorry can't do that. Don't bring in Starbucks from same plaza. They'll make you toss it. Good thing I was done!  What else... Oh, 50. Cents extra for a togo cup.  That's cwazy! Smells like a fresh bakery... Guess that's the ticket!? Or is it!
