This was the second visit, in as many weeks, and the cuts of Rib eye and Filet were very good on both occasions. I would suggest the Rib eye. See Photo.

Got the full Rack and half pound of brisket. Ribs were very fatty and mediocre. Cole slaw was pretty bland and not cold. Brisket was best of the lot and it was just fair. Not equal to Dave's BBQ by any means bit an okay fast food rib stop.  The price was high for what you get also

The fish here is good, however, the portions are far less than good. The $7 Halibut taco that claims a portion size of 4oz weighed in at 1.3oz and the Mahi Mahi taco weighed in at 1.8oz.  We have talked with the establishment on more than one occasion about this, but they do not seem to care. All they will say is "it loses a little broiling it".  It does not lose over half Oscar!

Cool stuff but takes a VERY long time to be seen for "appointment" to fix a new iphone. Been dealing with it since 2pm. A5 fists appointment was for about 4pm, then it said 4:30 pm and now it's almost 5pm and still waiting.  We were told there is still 7 people ahead of us, wth? I think Apple can spring for more employees or not over book by several hours. Okay,  it is 5:30 and we are still sitting in the store waiting for our appointment...this is ridiculous.

The Culinary Dropout at The Yard is a fantastic place to enjoy lunch on the patio. The prime rib dip is always tasty, as well as, the truffle chips. There are many games (cornhole, ping pong, giant Jenga) to enjoy before or after food, and even a free photo booth.  It is not located in the nicest area, but if you find your self near it, it is definitely worth the stop. See photos.

This is our new top pick for macaroons since our previous top choice being a bakery at Santa Monica Place changed their ownership and macaroons along with it. The proprietors are a nice French speaking couple that makes you feel welcome. See Photo.
