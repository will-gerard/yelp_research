I feel so bad for those live Midget horses. It was so hot out there, and one was limping. My wife was so bummed, and it ruined our whole shopping experience.   Other than that, it's the same ol parkn swap, just getting smaller, and smaller every year.

Ray is a great guy! Very fair rates. I'd the home work. ;) I HIGHLY recommend Ray & Todd to everyone I know!  First Class Auto Service is a hidden little car repair gem! These guys are honest, and true to thier word. If they say it costs a certain amount, thats what it is. They are SUPER fast. I have been going to Ray since 2011, cause he way recommended for the alignment specialists, but they go above and beyond for customer satisfaction!

Today 12/9/2013 3:47pm; was the 2nd worst day of my life. ;(  I lost my best friend, of 12 years. Cheeto. The best Pomeranian in the world!!!  Worst thing about it, was the vet named Raymond Gniadek (Hardly a doctor); if you need to put your dog down, I highly recommend not using this particular vet @ AZ Pet Resort. He honestly is a jerk.. Ask for Dr. Andrew Coonce. If my dog wouldn't have been so sick, I would have waited for Dr. Andrew. Raymond Gniadek tried to give my wife false hope, an more pills, that clearly wouldn't help!   Raymond Gniadek; It would have been nicer if he got the deadly drug in my dog the first time. This made it even worse for us. He had to shave his other paw, and finish the dose - He claimed Cheeto (the sedated dog) moved, and the needle slipped out!!   He was squirming, and kicking, and crying, so he clearly wasn't sedated enough!!! : ( Why did he screw this up on my poor lil dog!!! Man, that was a disaster!!   Thank god Raymond Gniadek, had Melissa assisting, because we were so close to leaving with our ill buddy, who was clearly suffering terribly, and going to another vet. But we just couldn't, the dog was too sick & we were too far in it by this time.  I am giving 2 stars ONLY because of the nurse, "Melissa" that assisted. She was nice, and understanding, & totally compassionate. Otherwise it would have been -5!  Raymond Gniadek your bedside manor is terrible, and I suggest retiring, because honestly; I feel you lost the passion for helping animals & families in a rough time. But definitely you lost our business!   Melissa, you are the super star of the clinic! Thank you for helping us.  Rest in piece Cheeto!! :( You were our best friend!!

Get rid of Jim the manager and I'll be back! Till then I'll pay more to go else where.   He is a rude pig, a total pirv, an really shady piece of shit!   My grandmothers Retirement community was scammed by him. (that's right, even @ the $3 Car wash!!) He was telling all the old folk of the Riviera Retirement Community in Scottsdale, it was minimum of $7.00!  I wouldn't have known till my Grandma gave me a $10 for her weekly car wash, and I said "10?? it's only 3 bucks Grams??" And she said "her friend in the mobile home community were told by "JIM" that it was 7 bucks!!!" I was furious! So I think I will be taking ALL my business else where!  Dude, I asked your employees yesterday, after you were rude again to me, and they said the owners were busting your nuts to upgrade sales? That's no excuse, to scam the seniors. Have a radio events there? Organize a charity event there??   Your in a prime location for this!! This outside the box JIM!!! But Ill tell ya! I will make sure every one in the area knows your greezy face!

Definitely wont be back!!! And I am actually trying to cancel the wellness plan. What a joke!! Long, long, long, long, long waits.. Dr. P is really a nice guy, but man, not everyone can afford a 200 X-ray for a 10 year old dog. ; (    Then I am over billed, for a 40 monthly plan, I was VERY explicate about. Definitely, stick with your regular vet before going to the Tempe Marketplace Banfield. I feel like i was scammed into the wellness plan, and miss lead. Now they want a charge for canceling!! The wrong plan I signed up for?  Not to mention, they shoved the thermometer up my lil dogs butt too far, and made him scream! I should have ran that moment.

I admit, I can be a pain in the ass customer! I know this first hand,  for most part.   Today, I had a wonderful conversation with Dr. Pierce, of Banfield Pet Hospital, and he has made me a satisfied customer. ;)  They made me feel 100% whole & satisfied with our issue(s). We understand now, that this plan was just not for us.  Me, and my dog Cheeto thanks you Banfield, for your attempt to help him get better, and as well, your immediate attention to our chief complaint(s).  And we will be in touch about Cheeto's health progress.   The Doc and his staff @Banfield Tempe Marketplace are super nice! So nice it actually saddens us to leave, but we need to do whats fiscally best for our checkbook, and our schedules.   Dr. Pierce, thank you again for calling me personally, and apologizing for the mis-understanding/mis-communications; you made a tough conversation / situation, totally comfortable. I can confidently recommend this Banfiled Animal Hospital services to all my friends knowing you put the animals health first.

From the un controllable LOUD kids, their running around, crawling under tables, to the WAY too close booths. I am honestly bummed about this place. If parents don't control their kids, staff should ask them to quite down. I wont be back, to that location at least.

I really like it. Glad you guys are here for the holidays! Chris H. Helped us, and he was so very helpful.  I was able to get all family something for Christmas. They basically saved my Christmas! I financed all my purchases, cause  i have been dealing with health problems these past couple months, and missed lots of work. Went to Conn's just to see what the letter they sent me of a Pre-Approval, and it is totally legitamate! Conns gave me a PHAT line of credit, so it has saved my 2013 Christmas! : ) Thanks Guys!!! I will be back for that iComfort king size bed, and the 80 inch TV!!!
