Great view of the fountain.  Outstanding food. I had the prime beef tenderloin.  Service was friendly and quick. Very pricey,  but that's to be expected at the Bellagio.

Lazy lack of attention to detail. They did a very poor job cleaning the inside. Obvious areas not even touched with a rag inside, and outside, my truck. Dust still on the doors, parts of the dashboard, and center console. Dirt still on the rear bumper... I went back to point out the lack off attention and to have them do the areas missed. They did it, but I got a "whatever" attitude vibe from the supervisor of all people. I wont be back.

They were a bit understaffed that night. And I think our server seemed a little inexperienced.  But other than that, a nice place, with live music. And the burger I ordered was outstanding!
