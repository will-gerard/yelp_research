It took me several years to find a family doctor that I could truly trust. I found Dr. Goldman about 2.5 years ago after having a severe allergic reaction and he was able to help me pin-point the cause and put me on a path to recovery.  Dr. Goldman and his nurse Maddie are truly great! I am saddened to say I am now leaving this practice because of a silly Admin fee they have now introduced along with a calling list they put their patients on to receive recorded advertising messages of medical services they provide. Really, you want me to pay $49 a month so you can send me infomercial voicemails to spend more money at your practice?!?!  I am generally a healthy person and maybe visit the doctor once or twice a year.  They already bill my insurance up the wazoo and also charge me a co-pay every visit, is that not enough?   Maybe if this doctors office was a luxurious spa, with outstanding customer service, would I consider spending a yearly fee.

By far, the worst music venue in the valley. The fees are unreasonable, drinks are expensive, no air flow, poor acoustics, line to get in is typically down the street and the employees are rude. I will go to Crescent, pub rock, rhythm room or Comerica any day over Marquee.

3 years ago I posted on FB that I needed a quality, local moving company and a friend was quick to respond that 'Camelback Moving' was the best!  Taking her recommendation I called and was surprised with their high level of customer service and the honest levels of expectations they set.  Camelback Moving did nothing but impress with their integrity and quality of work and friendly movers. As I was planning on moving in with my fiance I contacted CM for the second time and had a repeat excellent experience. I recommend this company to all my friends in the area. Thank you Camelback Moving!!

We had our rehearsal dinner at Tommy V's back in November.  Words cannot describe how grateful we are for the experience Zoran and his staff created for our closest friends and family. We were able to custom create a menu to work with our budget and everything turned out wonderful. Menus were even printed with our names and wedding date on them (sometimes just the little things make a big impression.) The private room was just the right size for our 30 guest and everyone sat comfortably. Thank you Tommy V's for  setting the stage for our wedding weekend!!

I used Maid Pro to clean my house as I turn it into a rental home. I researched on yelp and they had nothing but rave 5 star views and my experience totally matched that! Everything is spotless and looks/smells great. Carpets, hardwood floors, baseboards, cabinets all spotless.  Thank you Maid Pro for being an efficient, honest and friendly Maid service.

Props for the awesome decor and vibe but we thought the food was just OK for brunch; bland and nothing to write home about. Plus, we waited in a long line to order our food (30 mins) and by the time we got up front to order they were out of the  top 3 items I was considering to order.

We love living down the street, from what we deem, the best little donut shop in the greater PHX area. This shop has character, charm and best of all GREAT donuts. Hoping to see more small business/local cafes, stores and restaurants enter into S. Scottsdale like Born and Glazed.
