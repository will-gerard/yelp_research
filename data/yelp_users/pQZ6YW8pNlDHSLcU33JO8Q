Complete lack of customer service. The employees are only there to attempt to up sell you on a new plan. The "manager" told me to go to the Apple Store if I needed to get my problem fixed. I should have signed with Verizon. I will not be coming back for anything.

Costumer service is horrible I will not be coming back. I came in at midnight tonight to do some shopping. It had appeared the closed off the section where the restrooms were for waxing. They had not even started to wax yet but refused to let me use the washroom. So I thought whatever and started my shopping. By the time I got half way across the store they had shut down half of the market! They weren't even waxing and wouldn't let me grab the few items I needed. Worst yet is they were rude and refused to grab them for me if I wasn't allowed in the roped off areas. Customer service is a big thing for me and this places lacks it. I will not be going back, I'd rather shop at Walmart. Smh.

Brad is a genius, I won't let anyone else touch my hair. Could charge 100 dollars a cut and I would still come. Highly recommend!

Yum! Can't really go wrong with frozen yogurt. Everything is very clean and orderly, extremely costumer friendly. Also fairly priced!

Love this place! Came in for their famous Sunday Funday party and had a great time. Their host Garrett was super accommodating and helped us out throughout the night. The servers were all beautiful, best looking in town for sure! We ended up staying all night, the place never died out. I will definitely be coming back here more often! Oh and the tacos are life changing.

Came here the other day around 5 pm. The inside area was completely sat (maybe because it was 110 out) so we decided to sit on the patio. I had the Mac and cheese and a burger, the food definitely made up for the scorching heat. Great place to grab a burger if you feel like having a cheat day.

The food here is unreal, that apocalypse sow burger is a taste of the heavens. Also late night menu till 1am, can't beat that. Also the udon noodles are to die for. Even though the location could be better, I will be coming back.

Hands down my favorite place to drink on mill, also the burritos are so unique yet delicious they keep me coming back. The atmosphere is really what sets this place apart though, chill spot to hang with friends and grab a drink wether it's for happy hour or a night cap.

The manager of this establishment should really get a reality check. I came in with some friends for cocktails on a Monday July 6th and was immediately met with two girls running the opposite way and an overly intoxicated patron screaming as they left. We decided to stay even after the whole ordeal. I assumed the man would have been escorted out by management, unfortunately I was wrong. About 10 minutes went by and the over served patron approached my group and grabbed me by the shoulders asking if the girl next to me was my girlfriend. We left immediately. It is beyond me that a manager and staff can be so careless to let an overly intoxicated patron stay and terrorize other customers. I won't ever be coming back.

Came back and this place was amazing. Our server Ali was super helpful probably the best in the business! I had the Mac and cheese burrito and it was out of this world. The buckets were fairly priced for a ton of alcohol. Definitely a bang for your buck.

Went here after a workout to grab some protein shakes. Took a half hour for two smoothies when the place was completely empty. No customer service what so ever, wasn't even greeted with a smile. It looked as though 3 employees were standing around doing nothing while the other one worked.

I found this place on Craigslist and left a message Sunday because they were not open. I received a call first thing Monday from Patrick, and the whole experience has been treat since then! He was extremely helpful with me throughout the process even though I was doing the work myself and not contracting through them. I will definitely be coming back for my next project!

The apartments here seem to be pretty high quality, heavy cabinets, nice appliances, and granite countertops. Unfortunately you really must pay a premium to live here with rent for a 1 bedroom upwards of 1,500 dollars a month. For a location that is subpar in my opinion I would never pay that kind of money for such a basic pad. The common areas and pool are very nice, though the gym is basic at best. Overall nice place, I would never live here though.

This place is great, fresh concept in the heart of a thriving nightlife scene. Not to mention one of the best brunches I have had the pleasure of tasting. Their staff is top notch and service impeccable. I will definitely be a regular here for a long time to come!
