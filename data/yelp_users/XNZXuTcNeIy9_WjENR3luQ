If you're looking for a traditional english pub, you may like this place.  To me, it's was a little too dark and damp and the menu was very limited and a little overpriced.  Seems like a good place to watch a soccer game, even though the TV's aren't that great.

Last time I was there, the service was poor and the AC was broken and could not be shut off.  The back section of the restaurant was probably 55-60 degrees.

We came in with a bolt in the tread of the tire. Even though it was close to closing time, Craig and the other maintenance staff helped us quickly and were so kind and courteous. The got us back on the road in less than 20 minutes. I can't recommend this place highly enough. They made me a customer for life.

I stayed here over the July 4th weekend for a staycation.  Both pools could have been cleaner but were pretty nice.  My room was in rough shape.  The front door had previously been broken into and the pry marks were still on the door.  The door handle had also put a hole in the interior wall that had not been repaired.   I honestly expected a lot better and was let down.

This hardware store has great service.  Everyone is friendly as soon as you walk in.  Wes helped me several times throughout the day and kind/understanding/patient every time.  They don't have the best selection and the prices are a little higher than Home Depot or Lowes, but you can't beat the customer service and quick in/out time.

I just joined a volleyball league at Prankster's Too in south Scottsdale.  The outdoor volleyball area is very nice.  Good sand.  Nice lighting.  Full outdoor bar.  If I were only rating the outdoor part of Prankster's, I would give it a 5/5.  The inside of the bar needs to be updated.  Its kind of dark and outdated and just needs some attention.

I needed the shaft replaced on my Ping driver.  I am relatively new to golf, but the staff at AZ Golf works was very helpful and nice.  I didn't feel intimidated or pressured into buying anything.  Looking around, they have the best prices in the valley and they got the job done the very next day.  I highly recommend AZ Golf Works.

I wish that I could give them a zero.  I found a car on my True-Car app.  I called to verify the price. I received multiple confirmations via email and telephone that the price was accurate and the car was in stock.  You probably see where this is going.  Chapman Chevrolet would not honor the True Car price and said it was internet error.  This was a classic/dirty bait and switch.  I was going to just let it go, but then I received several emails from Chapman asking about my experience.  When I responded to the customer feedback email with my complaint, I didn't hear anything.  No apology or anything.

Hidden treasure on Central Ave.  Authentic, local, Phoenix culture.  Coffee and pastries are fairly priced and very good.  Cocktails in the evening are unique but a little pricey.

Food was good.  I had the wrap and it was great.  Beer selection was below average and they were out of two different selections listed on their menu.

Was on time.  Flipped around my front door handle for free and made me a few courtesy keys for my side gate.  As good as it gets.

Very cool spot.  Staff is always helpful.  Their signature cocktails are way above average.  I recommend the pork sandwich!

I had the green chile pork burrito.  It was above average and I would order again.  The service was great.  My drink was always full and the server kept us full on chips/salsa.

The location isn't ideal, but once you are inside it's the best spring training park in the valley.  The fans are always nice and loud.  The food is good and the team really cares about making sure you have a good experience.

Really cool location and atmosphere.  The island/tropical themed cocktails are pretty awesome.  I love the coconut shrimp rolls but I wish the menu was a little more robust.  Not a ton of options.  Overall, still a really good spot.

Great spot for lunch.  Spicy Chicken Pita is big enough for two!  Always busy, but they still manage to get you seated pretty quick.

One of my favorite places in Phoenix.  The menu is creative and really tasty.  The beer list is long and affordable.  And the service is really great.  This is a great lunch spot in downtown Phoenix.  You won't regret it.

Best patio in midtown.  My favorite place to get brunch.  If you're in central Phoenix, this is a MUST!  Their staff is amazing, helpful, and works on a team service concept so you never get neglected.   They don't rush you out and let you hang for hours.  Somehow they've accomplished a small-town, neighborhood restaurant feel, right on Central Ave. in Phoenix.  I highly recommend the Quinoa Oatmeal!

I had a leak in a PVC joint as well as some coverage issues.  Sprinkler Doctors sent Mark D. to my house.  He arrived early and got the job done fast.  He addressed every one of my issues and made sure I was happy with the work before he left.  When it came time to pay the bill, I was very happy with the value.  I expected to pay a lot more.  If you have been wanting to address some problems with your sprinkler system, call the Sprinkler Doctors and ask for Mark D.  You won't be disappointed.  I will be a customer for life.

He came to my house late on a Sunday night to get the job done before Monday (which we really needed).  As he was leaving, my wife noticed a small spot on one rug, he came back in with is equipment and removed the stubborn small spot.

Great beer list, but its a little pricey.  Some of the pints can run $8-$9.

Brent was so helpful and never pushy. When comparing House of Diamonds to stories from friends/family, the value isn't even close. They communicate quickly and really go the extra mile to make sure you're taken care of.

Best patio in downtown Phoenix.  I recommend the Hot Chick chicken sandwich or the Nachos.  The staff is top notch and super nice.

Their beer list is amazing.  Great selection, its always changing and the prices are fair.  The food is good, although the menu is a little limited.  My only complaint is that the service is sometimes slow.

The food and service were amazing. We got the pulled pork and hush puppies. I couldn't have been more impressed with the sandwich and fries. It was amazing

Danielle is a great realtor and guide through the home buying process.  She is professional, responsive and knowledgable.  We were first time home buyers and she took the time to walk us through each step of the process.  We never felt dumb for asking too many questions and she always had thoughtful answers.  Her best character trait is that she listens to what you really want and does not try to force particular houses on you just to get a sale (as I've heard many other realtors have).  I give her my absolute highest review and recommendation.

I really wanted to like this place.  My chicken sandwich was above average and the beer list is pretty good.  Unfortunately, the atmosphere is tired and dated and our service was deplorable.  We watched hopelessly for at least 15 minutes while our pints sat on the bar top sweating in the AZ heat.
