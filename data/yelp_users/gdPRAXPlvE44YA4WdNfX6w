This place is considered a steakhouse?? More like a child care service with mediocre food. Noisy, no dress code, extremely slow service and really disappointing. Stupid kids running everywhere. Our server was a low talker, which made it hard to hear what he was explaining on the menu. Steaks were tough, shrimp was dry and a dinky bowl of beans for a table of 6. I just can't right now.

First and last time here. I was told the chili was home made but it tasted like Kroger brand out of a can. My friend ordered a quesadilla and didn't like it and she was asked twice if she needed a to go box and replied with "No, I didn't like it." GM  didn't even respond and when the same convo occurred between my friend and our server, his reply was "No worries." Shouldn't HE be worried? He does work off tips.  Draft beers weren't even cold. Ugh. Not impressed one bit. I'd refer this establishment as an upscale Chili's, at best.   They seem to be accommodating to the handicapped though.

Here on a Monday and the bartender couldn't see past a three foot radius. I sat at the one seat open at the bar that had the leftovers from a previous guest for 30 minutes before I had to switch seats from the mess not being cleaned up. Then, I got a view of the kitchen and remembered why I don't come to chili's. It was a complete mess and the MANAGER was munching on food just adding on more weight. Gross. My memory serves me right.

First time here for lunch. Immediately greeted by the hostess with a friendly smile. Took a seat at the bar and the bartender (petite brunette) was extremely pleasant and accommodating. She told me what she usually orders and I opted for that choice...very satisfied! It was the gyro without the pita bread with the tzaziki and lemon dressing on the side. Atmosphere was very clean and inviting. Cheers!

Not a place that caters to the elderly. Took my father here for a trim and they refused him service. They wanted to charge the full price of a pedicure for just a trim and turned him away (after walking him in a walker due to a handicap). Sad way to run a business.

Worst club in Vegas. Fuck a club where you can't ask for party favors (meaning fireworks for a bachelor party) bc they have a zero tolerance for anything fun. And you'll get walked out like a criminal with the schmuck security manager and a goon bouncer. Ruined a Vegas weekend altogether and will never be back. Not recommended to ANYONE. F This dump.  Not to mention they took $700 of prepaid dough from my boys and didn't give two fucks about any type of refund. Avoid at all costs.

It was proven tonight...this is a pure WT bar...white trash. Management proved it, along with the patrons. I'm disgusted. Management approves of regulars who complain about those who come here to spend a good $ on a drink and a fight only to be shut down by those who are paying to be here rather than those who pay to party. What a joke. Concentrate on those who pull in money rather than the white trash who come here expecting a hand out.

My wife and I have been coming here for two years. The service is always friendly and the food has been consistently delicious. Best egg drop soup I've ever had too. The ingredients are always fresh and it's nice to support a local business. Best Chinese food in the east valley! Always clean and welcoming.

Took my dad here and met Tony. A real friendly guy who keeps his shop very clean and sanitary. Price is extremely reasonable and he did a great job on my dad in order to be prepared for my upcoming wedding. Convenient hours and also takes appointments if needed. I'll be taking pops here from now on. I just hope I have time tomorrow to stop in for a beard trim and line up!

First of all, when you're here, you're family. The hospitality here is unparalleled. When time permits, Vito, the owner, and the crew will be sure to stop by, introduce themselves and drop a friendly hello. It's so nice to come to such a wonderful Italian restaurant and have authentic cuisine. Vito definitely takes pride in his work and the staff delivers. When you come, request Desiree and tell her Mark and Cristina recommended her. Enjoy the amazing food and ambiance. Support your local Italianos and enjoy what Vito and his staff is proud to serve you! Till next time, ciao!

Mistakenly came here for a second time, on my birthday, no clue why. The doormen asked my wife where we were prior and she named a bar that recently closed and they refused her entry saying she was too drunk. What a joke. The bar we were at was only open for four days and she couldn't recall the new bar's name so she stated the previous name and they deny entry for THAT? Never again. Avoiding at all costs. Spare yourself.

I came across Gateway Barbershop here on Yelp and I am so glad I did. Panda hooked me up with one of the best fades I've ever had and also took care of my pops with exactly what he was in need of. Panda also trimmed up all the extras without asking and my dad looks and feels great. Very clean shop and time taken to make sure patrons are pleased. I'm very particular with my haircuts and when I find a great barber I never go anywhere else. I'll be checking in here every weekend. Much as gracias Panda!
