The only place where movies are the most important thing in the world. A legitimate 1990's dingy poorly lit video rental store. Amazing!

Food so good you just want to fuck it rather than actually eat it!

The dude with the dreadlocks is annoying and rude. I stopped going there just because of him. I advised my friends to do the same. The menu is okay though. Nothing groundbreaking or inspired.

If sunshines and flowers could sell clothes or jewelry it would be like Frances. With that said, sunshines and flowers could probably use help with the selection of mens wear and accessories. Maybe a gun, sunshine, and flower collabaration would fix that.

The beer selection was so incredible that I threw up in my friends mouth.

I dined here with 2 other people.  Somehow the server never once asked me if i needed anything to eat or drink. It was as if he had a personal vendetta against me. So in the hour I spent there I can't say I even had a glass of water.   Moving past that portion of our experience there, both of my friends got violently sick from the food there. Simply put, I love sushi and I live right next door to Moira but I don't eat there and never will.

Giant Coffee really misleads their customers. The size of the coffee there is comparable to any other coffee house. "Normal Sized Coffee" might be more fitting.

This is how shopping should be experienced. Beautiful clothes and knowledgable staff.          If you have a negative review of this place, you are either poorly dressed or unable to afford the brands sold here.

the cookies are so big here that your life will seem smaller in comparison.

This is your typical Urban Outfitters for the most part, just a little on the small side. The store is staffed with people you'd probably try to have sex with. They just don't look like they'd enjoy it.

alan, an employee or part owner of guitar pickers had emailed me everyday for weeks to bring a guitar that he seemed desperate to buy. after about 5 weeks of him emailing me i finally went down. he looked at my guitar and offered me 20% of what he had mentioned through his emails. what made it worse is that when i declined his offer he called me the "N" word and told me to leave his store immediately. i left and won't ever plan on going back.

i called the audio doctor about a repair for some speakers. nothing about this call made me think he wanted to work on them. I felt like i was putting him out by asking questions he could be great at what he does, but just not a friendly person.

I directly dealt with Roman, the owner, on a pair of jeans. This was a pair of jeans that I never received. After about a month, Roman stopped returning any emails. The store is closed at CityScape. There are many similar stories of  other customers not getting jeans or it taking months to get a pair. There are so many other raw denim options at there that you shouldn't risk losing your money with Lawless Denim ( terrible name by the way, Lawles?)   UPDATE 12/6/2014  so after my review, Jim Fuentes contacted me. To clarify,i placed and paid for an order back about a year ago then contacted them again this year to receive a promotional pair. I took me leaving a negative review for anybody to contact me. they stopped emailing me before so i encourage to leave a negative review to resolve your issues. unfortunately for me, Jim was not helpful. In fact, he said i was not a client of theres. He claimed that i didn't receive my jeans because their employees have to eat lunch, don't work weekends, and a bunch of weird excuses. Either way, i did not receive either pair. And Jim and I might come to blows over this.

my old review of lawless seems to have vanished. heres a quick recap. i ordered jeans twice and never received a pair or a refund. its been 2 years. only after i wrote negative review did lawless contact me. they didn't offer any kind of refund or actual product. they just explained how they were busy.
