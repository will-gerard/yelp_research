I heart Half Price... and I'm also excited they recently opened a new location on East Camelback-- the PV one is the first one I discovered... I have found a crazy number of dirt cheap DVDs and clearance books here, not to mention they have a great selection of regularly priced used books... have even found deeply discounted new books in the front part of the PV store.  But by far I enjoy the clearance section the most-- I head straight back there usually, then wander back through the store towards the front to pay.  I always find at least one or two things in the back that are in great condition (usually $1-$2 apiece).  If looking for something specific, I think it can be a little trickier at Half Price, at least in my experience if I'm looking for a specific title.  But I've walked out of the place with a bag full of books/DVDs for under $20.  Hard to beat that!

Never. Again.  Wow, now I'm even more irritated after reading other reviews. Apparently the staff here are perfectly capable of being friendly when they want to be. Maybe I need a bull ring piercing like the miserable looking cashier in front to get decent customer service.   Even the way they respond on here to customers who've had bad experiences can be summed up like this: "We're sorry YOU had such a bad experience here, but here's why we are still in the right."  Unfortunately, for me it's the vibe I've gotten at both the Tempe and Indian School locations that guarantees I won't be back to either of them. I went to the Tempe location at 5:45pm on a weeknight, thinking they were open until 7. I confused their hours with Blick's. I was informed the moment I got in the door that "we close in ten minutes."   The Tempe store is a little claustrophobic, about the size of a large bedroom and, obviously, I felt like I needed to get in and out as they were closing, so not much time to look around or see what type of selection they had. I found a couple of things I was interested in buying but didn't think there was time to ask questions.  I gave them a second go at the Indian School location when I knew they weren't closing anytime soon, early afternoon on a weekday. This one is larger with a nice selection but, like another reviewer said here, there are notes EVERYWHERE letting you know you're being watched. It's like being simultaneously snubbed while also being watched like a hawk.  Also I got to overhear two employees saying snide things about customers who'd just left.  I would shop at the Indian School location regularly if not for the shitty customer service. The prices are high but they have a decent selection. Again, it comes down to giving money over to a company that employs people who are rude. There are just way too many other, better options out there to get the products you want. And since this place is so expensive, there's absolutely no draw for me to go back in there.     Just, no.   I'm sorry I spent any money there today. Thankfully, it wasn't a lot. Will definitely go to Jerry's or Blick's for any future shopping.

Really enjoyed my shopping experience here. The store is well-organized and has a lot of fun eye candy to look at. The employees were the high point! All three people in the store, at the time I was there, were friendly, answered many questions, and definitely knew their stuff. It is awesome to see real artists running an art supply store because they are passionate and knowledgeable. So glad I stopped in -- previously I had only ordered from this company online and didn't even know they had brick & mortar stores.  My favorite part? Testing out watercolor crayons at the front of the store, where they were neatly displayed with quality watercolor papers to play with. Both of the women I spoke to in the shop were so sweet! There were no hard sell techniques. Very personable, clean and well-lit store. It also smelled good in there -- clean with a touch of lavender or some other kind of essential oil. Highly recommended!

At One Yoga is one of my favorite places to be, period.  After a trial membership I decided to take the plunge and become a full fledged member- a little steep in price, but like another reviewer said on here, you get what you pay for.  The instruction is phenomenal... impressive, too that many of their instructors and guest instructors are internationally recognized.  I find incredible peace and empowerment through the music, challenging classes, and welcoming energy at At One.  It took me two or three weeks to figure out what levels of yoga worked for me-- some of the classes are still a little too challenging for me, and I appreciate that they offer some "slower" classes.  Current favorite instructors/classes: Mimi (deep stretch), Danielle (all levels), Gina (flow) and Stephanie (candlelight flow). Also have had amazing experiences with the restorative class and basics.   Also, huge bonus: this is one of those yummy studios where the instructors give you mini-massages during your practice.  What spells bliss?  Crouching down into child's pose while your awesome instructor rubs your back!  Wow...  *Tip-- arrive a few minutes early so you can get a good spot, since some classes are packed.

Well, it's fresh, and it's easy.  Perfect words to describe this cute, clean little store!  This was my fave F&E in Phoenix because it was a mere block and a half from my place.  I STILL miss it, and I moved away from Phx over a year ago!  I popped in here several times a week to pick up staples, (it was always an adventure to see which prices had been marked down-- they even have a section in cold foods where they mark older stuff way down).  I appreciated their little bundles of veggies which were sold in just-right amounts (as in, not so much that some of it will end up going bad). This market was also great for soups (their brand was my pick, although they have a selection of major brands as well); it was also my go-to place for prepared healthful lunches perfect for work (like the F&E pre-made burritos and pasta dishes).    Check out frozen foods too-- there are reasonably priced items like tempura, and special organic seafood dishes I never found anywhere else.    I also liked the casual setup of the checkout area, with the option for a cashier or self-serve.    And...wait for it... I just found out they are opening at least two F&Es in Sacramento!!!  (okay, that won't likely cause much of a stir with the Phoenix crowd, but I am so excited they'll be open in my area!)

Normally I wouldn't review a place that I'd only visited once, but I'm just so dang excited there's a vegan restaurant close to where I work that i had to post on this one.  I ordered the Hawaiian Burger w/ Fries (takeout)... love that I got the experience of a down & dirty "splurge" meal that killed neither my wallet nor my energy level.  I felt meal-satisfied and also alert and springy enough to continue the rest of my work day (the exact opposite would have occurred had I eaten an actual hamburger).  The fries were decent but the real pleaser was the burger itself-- sliced pineapple, grilled onions, deliciously teriyaki-infused veggie patty that had a hearty texture yet left me with a clean (not greasy) feeling afterward.  Yum!  I left off one star for the customer service-- they were friendly enough, just slooow.  But I'll definitely be returning just so I can try some of the other deliciousness I eyed on their menu...

I can't say enough about this club! I've been here twice now, and both visits were gut-busting funny entertainment. A girlfriend of mine introduced me to Stand Up! and I'm quickly becoming a regular.  The club has a personal feel because the owner, Howard Hughes, does his own monologue among the other comedians. He is damn funny, and in fact Howard, if you're reading this right now -- please consider being a headliner yourself one of these nights! I don't know if club owners do that, but I'd definitely pay to see him do an hour-long show. He's just one of those dudes who's naturally funny.  This last weekend we went to see Lynne Koplitz, who was so funny, we were literally doubling over laughing throughout her time on stage.   The appetizers and desserts are yummy, and it feels good to support this club because it's locally owned. You might even get a chance to see Huma, Howard's adorable dog (I think she's the bouncer).
