My hubby and I used to come here all the time when we were dating.  I just took our daughter and him back and nothing has changed. They are awesome. Go on Thursdays because marshmallow is my favorite, you should like their Facebook page to find out daily flavored. They also have great prices!!

I was honestly upset the moment we walked in. We booked our stay over a month in advance from hotels.com. it was just my husband and I. We left the kids with my mom for a romantic getaway. The front desk guy informs us we get a room with two Queens  (that honestly were doubles we have a queen at home and these beds were smaller.) There was gum on the floor from the previous person and dust was hanging from the fire sprinklers. I will say I like the location and the tiny beds were at least very comfortable. I do like Dick's and their drink choices. I haven't decided if I'll stay here again. Honestly the bed thing made me mad!

OMG!!! I love the jumbo bakers! They are HUGE!! I love potatoes so of course I love these lol. They have pickled onions that I could eat all alone. They are amazing. One of the reasons I come! My hubby and daughter love the homemade root beer! I also must say best BBQ sauce around. I recommend the spicy.

For real.... How hard is it to get simple orders correct. I'm not the only one in my family having this issue. I refuse to go to sonic anymore I can not handle the disappointment of an incorrect order.

I stopped here with my baby who adores Chinese food and my hubby. The prices were amazing and the staff was super friendly!! The food was fast Chinese but way better than Panda Express and cheaper plus family owned. I love that! We will be back!

The food is always fresh and every time we've gone the same cashier is there and she is super nice! My daughter loves building her own bowl. The iced tea is awesome also!!  Very clean, fresh, and friendly.

I'm not a fan of fancy Mexican food. I don't think we need it to contain beets or whatnot. It is very pricy and in a state where Mexican food is so prevalent I feel like they are trying to make themselves look better than what they are. Save your money and go to the tacos stand down the street you'll be happier.

Reviewing this is hard. They used to be my favorite places to go. I loved the fajitas. However the portions get smaller every time and the service gets worse and worse. I love the hatch chili but sometimes they forget it and don't bring it to me. They don't refill the drinks and you never see the waiters or waitresses. It wouldn't be so bad but it cost about sixty dollars every time we go there. If I'm paying I want good service and not tiny portions. We've stopped going here because it is no longer worth the price. Like I said it USED to be my favorite but no longer. Going to fast food Mexican is more satisfying because at least I'm not out a lot of money. I love good Mexican food!!

Not going to lie I went to this taco bell and the cashier was telling me how she had her card so she could legally smoke weed and that she was high right now. I was like ummmm ok I have my children in the car with me. It took 33 minutes to get through the drive through with five people ahead of me. I ordered a grande box and I got 6 hot sauces totally for ten items. Thanks what kid do I decide doesn't get sauce......I guess me as the mom. I asked for the bean burritos to have everything they had nothing but beans, this is made worse by the fact I had no sauce to help it go down. I'm very upset with what I got.

Wow! My pizza showed up so burnt that it's hard and my child can't even eat it. I'm super excited to pay good money for burnt food. My cheese sticks are so burnt you can see the brown burnt cheese on top. I'm glad you saw my order was burnt and decided to send it to me anyways. That's awesome customer service.

I have friends that rave about this place is will say I love the fact that all guacamole can be added to everything! The cheese enchiladas were very good and I love me some rice. They had a nice set uo that was clean and they gave me both kinds of salsa without a hassle. I was alone lol. I preferred the red. It was very flavorful.

We've rented cars from here on many occasions. They've always been friendly and helpful. We rented last month they were very very busy. We were fine waiting. The manager went above and beyond to make everyone waiting happy. We picked up a car this time on a Saturday. We called the night before and changed our reservation from later to earlier. The lady was helpful and let you husband change it.  We showed up and they got us in a car and back home in under 17 minutes. I was impressed.

We went tonight for date night. I told my hubby I wanted bar food. The waitress (I'm so mad I didn't get her name) was amazing. She was my favorite. I packaged half my food to go and she offered lids for my sauce. I'm not going to lie that's few and far between at any place, and goes a long way with me!! I am an awful eater lol. I wanted the french dip but with chicken and mushrooms and onions. She got the order correct and it came super fast and fresh. It was so Delish. I was very leased with our experience tonight.

We purchased two futons for our daughter, two bookcases for me and an awesome floor lamp. We had everything delivered. They called and were on time with the delivery. When we started putting everything together the futons came assembled but everything else had to be put together. When we put the lamp together it was missing a piece. It took me a week to get the lamp back to the store. They exchanged it with no issues what so ever, the guy that brought us the. Ew lamp even helped load it and opened it to check it was ok. The lady at the return Counter was super nice. On a plus side you can't beat the prices here either.

I'm super picky about my meat and this being a place that really only serves ground meat I was  apprehensive. I must say the chicken burger I got was amazing! It was the best tasting one I have ever had! They cooked it and even listened to how I liked it! The craft beers are delish as well! We went here for a friends birthday party and they did a great job with service and food. I was impressed.

It was a fun time with friends.  The food was good and drinks were awesome. I dislike only having tall chairs to sit on because I have short legs and like to touch the ground.

I came here with my best friend and we split a bean and cheese burrito and we got a few street tacos. The street tacos were amazing!  We did have to wait a little bit because it was taco Tuesday and some big group wiped them out, but the girl behind the counter kept checking on us and she was so nice! The burrito was fresh and the tortilla was amazing. The tacos were so flavorful and fresh. The salsa was on point. I will definitely be back. Great local restaurant with a friendly small town feel.

I love the fact that these are personal (super huge!) pizzas, so I can get whatever I want to one it! They have a plethora of toppings and sauces! It's so cool! Plus the sinks in the bathroom are awesome. Only down side they need to do numbers for their pizzas so you know if it's yours or not.

We live in the mecca of amazing Mexican food then there is this place. When did Mexican food become so sweet it hurts my teeth? I was so disappointed it was horrid. However I will say young people seemed to love this. Me I prefer  food that's called Mexican to actually be Mexican. Even my child hated this and she hates spicy. Ehh gross. However the staff.at the register was friendly.

This place was very fast and very friendly. I love the spicy BBQ sauce and I found out they have ever one even hotter I can't wait to try. Taco Tuesday is a great deal!! My hubby got the tacos and they were very yummy. I got the chicken and it had so much flavor it was almost a shame to put the sauce on it! I got the chicken and macaroni and cheese for my daughter (she is seven) she loved the Alfredo Mac so much she stole mine as well! I can't wait until next Thursday we are picking up wings! They are rotisserie wings with a dry rub and the flavor is amazing!! The prices are so good I can take all my kids (family of seven lol) and not break the bank (soooo much better than fast food chains lol)! It's our new favorite go to! Plus I love supporting small local family owned places and you can feel the warmth when you walk through the door!
