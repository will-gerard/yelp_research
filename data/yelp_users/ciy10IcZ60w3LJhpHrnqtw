Unexpected find hidden in a light industrial park near the Scottsdale Airport.  Family owned and run with great, simple fare.  Authentic, home-style Italian...nothing fancy or high-brow, but very good! Great spot for a satisfying lunch...be warned, though...there is not table service; you walk-up and place your order at a counter.

You'd never know such a hidden gem exists tucked behind a dump of an old shopping center, but when you open the doors the foodie gods will sound their trumpets and the angels will sing!   This place is a FIND....not stuffy or pretentious, but the offerings are on par with the best I've had anywhere!  Fantastic, spare decor. Friendly host staff. AMAZING, vibrant, and creative craft cocktail list. Fantastic, funky and often WAY out of your comfort zone menu selections.  Love their tasting menu that allows you to taste any three items on the menu for $45!  We added a shared appetizer (whipped goat cheese with charred beets...probably my favorite dish of the evening!).

A little hard to find, but well worth it!  Charming, cozy, and welcoming interior where you'll be greeted by friendly (not snooty) baristas and kind patrons.  A great place to meet or work, they offer free wi-fi, a great meeting space (for rent) and comfortable surrounds. The coffee offerings are delicious and they baristas are very accomodating.  Their food offerings are also wonderful, the locally made pastires are delicious and on a recent visit the chef made me a yummy avocado toast on a crusty artisan bread that was drool-worthy!  I hope this place is a success!
