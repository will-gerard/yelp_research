Came here for a weekend for a little getaway and it was perfect! It's def a family friendly hotel and lots of great activities for the kids by the pool!   -movies by the pool -They passed out Popsicles for the kids -cool water slides And the list can go on  At night it's equally as beautiful and fun! They have the fire pits going along w/ live music. Beautiful resort that I will love to go back and stay at!

Love southwest. Always on time and makes your flying experience feel easy and quick.. I just think they def need too work more on finding more friendly flight attendants... They seem miserable and think they are a person a favor by asking of I would like a beverage or a lousy bag of peanuts!

I was part of a large party, over 20 of us had our hair done that day. I decided to get a tiny up do. I just wanted a simple pony tail with a little poof and my clip in extensions snapped to my pony tail. So the stylist told me that she doesn't want to blow dry my hair because it's easier to do the updo this way. I was fine with it because I said she's a stylist and knows what she's doing. I go to pay up front and it comes out to $80!! She didn't even blow out my hair she just did a pony tail and clipped my extensions in! I told the receptionist "that I thought $80 was way to much for a pony tail and NO BLOW OUT"  said said well it took our stylist 1hr.. I  was so disappointed I could have did it better at home and saved $80 plus a $10 tip  I was a really loyal customer to dry bar and so were my family and friends. What a turn off when you feel like your being takin advantage of. I will make sure to tell all my close ones to be careful they don't rip you off!
