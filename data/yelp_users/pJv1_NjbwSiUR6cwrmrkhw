Everybody knows Pho is the best cure after a night of obsessive drinking...and in Vegas I know almost everybody be getting drunk so read this and check em out!  Pho Vietnam is located on Spring Mountain Rd. in the "Asian District" above Sam Woo.  The place is clean, service is polite (Vietnamese servers are so much nicer than Chinese/Koreans!) and the food is bomb!  Their pho broth comes out piping hot and the taste is clean and soothing like it's made from real beef broth and not just water and MSG (which is still good hahaha).  Their meat is not paper thin but big and thick and comes out rare, make sure to dunk it under the noodles.  Order the crunchy eggrolls!  If you got room order the french bread w/ bbq pork or beef!  They bake the bread fresh and it's crispy and perfect!  I know it might sound weird to be eating Pho in Vegas but this is the place to be after waking up w/ a hangover =)  Bonus!  The prices aren't that bad- compared to the $13 pho at the Venetian and Rio Hotel!

Buffet at the Wynn.... I'M STUFFED!  When I grabbed my first plate I was in awe at all the different types of gourmet cuisines.  I felt like Charlie when he visited Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory!     Lemme tell you I got my grub on and with Yelp in mind I made sure to try out everything!    Quality is key and the Wynn definitely  don't pinch pennies.  They have the plumpest shrimp cocktails, juiciest tender prime rib and a very proud salad selection (over 6 salad cups).  They have a Pasta station where you can choose type of pasta and ingredients (grilled cloves of garlic my fav).    Meat station...was a hit!  Yummy sausage links, prime ribs, lamb and more.  The hispanic dude carving was a jerkoff tho- he kept saying "neehou" and I told him I wasn't Chinese and he still kept saying crap in Mandarin!    Seafood station....was a miss.  DO NOT come for the CRAB!  Wynn serves cold crab legs and it's cut in half for you which is supposed to make it easier to eat but actually makes it harder to get out the crab meat!  For Seafood go to RIO SEAFOOD BUFFET- they have hot and cold crab legs and hot lobster tails too!  Dessert station...a miss.  It  faked me out!   The bright red candied apple was harder than a rock and I couldn't break the hard candy shell.  The creme brulee looked perfect until I took a bite and saw the custard was watery soup.  *pout*  Such a tease... I tried telling the lady worker that the Creme Brulee was bad but she didn't speak any English!  I was a bit disappointed at the Wynn Buffet after hearing such great reviews I expected more.    All in all it's a great buffet but there more misses than hits for me.  I give it a 4 star for presentation, selection and quality.    BUT....Go to Rio for seafood crab legs and oysters,  Grand Luxe Cafe at the Venetian for yummy sandwiches and shrimp scampi and Wynn Buffet for prime rib.

BROKEN GLASS EVERYWHERE  No, this is not a line from Grandmaster Flash but literally, there were shards of glass underneath my table!!!  I was eating with my friends this morning when I felt something wet on my foot.  When I looked down, I was shocked to see my foot covered in blood!  I became nauseated and wanted to faint.  I called the server to ask for a band aid and told him that I had cut myself on a piece of glass.  As I examined the floor I found more broken pieces!   When the server disappeared for more than TEN MINUTES I then asked for the Manager who took another FIVE minutes to attend to me.  WHY WERE THEY TAKING SO LONG!?  When the Manager came, that is when I realized Mandalay Bay will hire just anyone who will work the graveyard shift.  The manager's attitude about the entire situation was disappointing and disrespectful.  There I was, bleeding profusely (cut was pretty deep) and she didn't rush over to me because she said she was waiting for security because that is their policy.  I understand business has policies but I what I don't is why she couldn't come over immediately to assess the situation.  The cafe was empty (it was 6am) and I was flagging down every server to get the Manager.  The demeanor and tone she used made me feel like she really didn't give a crap about her customer.    All she had to say was, "I'm sorry this happened I will get security to help you with first aid." but when I told her that she said with attitude, "I cannot apologize because then I'm claiming liability.  Also, our business policy states that you cannot be barefoot." Which got me more upset because I came in wearing heels!  I took them off while eating .  I've seen kids crawling on the floors at these restaurants what if a piece of glass had cut one of them?!  What if someone fell and sliced their wrist on the glass?!    Mandalay Bay used to be a high-class resort with excellent customer care but they have definitely lost their value.  Maybe that is why their room rates were significantly lower than the others on the strip- no one is staying there anymore.  They have nice rooms but I don't think I will be coming back here anymore.  I hope someone at Mandalay Bay can address this rude Manager at Raffles Cafe and get her fired.   She's a black girl, in her early thirty's with glasses I didn't get her name, right when I started filing a complaint she disappeared.  She should not be allowed to work in any customer service position.    What a bad way to end my weekend in Vegas.

LOBSTER, SUSHI & CRAB OH MY!!!  I was surprised by how many people who go to Las Vegas don't know about the Seafood Buffet at the Rio Casino Hotel!  I've been to all the buffets in Vegas but the Rio has to be the BEST when it comes to SEAFOOD!  Their sushi is fresh and delicious, the lobster tails & Alaskan King Crab legs are steaming and HOT just drenched in butter, they have prime rib & rack of lamb that's tender & yummy!  They also have a Mexican & Chinese station for people who don't like seafood.  OOh and the Dessert Station is awesome!  They have all kinds of pies, eclairs, tarts, brownies, rice crispy treats, cream puffs, chocolate & custard fruit cups (my fav) & ice cream *drool* soooo good!  The price is $35 and the line is ridiculously long so get there early!

NEVER FAILS...  Every time I come to Vegas I always eat the Rio Seafood Buffet and I have NOT ONCE been disappointed.  Thank you for staying true to the food lovers =)  The hot steaming Alaskan King Crab legs are thick and juicy and the Lobster tails are my fav.    They have a huge selection of Sushi and Sashimi =)  I've gotten so good at crackin the crabs the people sitting next to me just stared at me in amazement and said, "Wow you're a pro at this!" which I replied, "I should be I've been coming here for over 5 yrs!"    Seriously I think I'd whoop anyone's ass in a crab leg eating contest.... I got it down.... crack the middle part, slide the meat out nice and long ('that's what she said' haha) and dip in butter and into my tummy all in one quick smooth motion!    OMG I am such a fatty!  hahaha  I love it

'U MIGHT WIN SOME BUT U JUST LOST ONE"   Lauryn Hill said it best in her song...U might win some but U just lost one is dang right.    I used to rave about the seafood buffet at the Rio but last night's mediocre dinner and unprofessional staff proved how much the Village Seafood Buffet has FALLEN OFF.  They changed the interior design to make it look nicer but for the first time ever - NO LONG LINE!  For a Sunday night it was empty.  Even though the decor LOOKED updated  the taste of cuisine quality sank low.  The steamed crab leg was still delicious but everything else was CRAP.  Mediocre sushi, dried out rice/noodle dishes, salty salty fried food....Hometown Buffet quality food for $49 was a slap in the face.  What happened?  =(    It's sad.   Don't they know that with all the new buffets at the Wynn, Cosmo and others brand new spots they have to do MORE and be BETTER than ever?!?!  I spent $100 for 2 dinners that was horrible.  The desserts here used to be really good but it tasted different.  My favorite chocolate cup with vanilla custard and fruits was bland.  The creme brulee was grainy and mushy.  WOMP WOMP WOMP =(  FAIL.  I even had to complain to the Manager about their staff.  The girls working behind the dessert bar straight YAWNED in our faces and blatantly ignored us when we tried to get their attention.  The prime rib station guy was missing all night and kept going to the back to chat with the other workers.  The Manager didn't do anything for us (didn't expect it not surprised) but thanked me for my comments.  Note to the manager:  you should always offer a discount or rain check for another visit when you have an unhappy customer.  We're only trying to help.  *shrug*  They just lost one.

SHHHH!  VEGAS'S MILLION DOLLAR OX TAIL SOUP HERE!  I don't want to blow up the spot but sharing is caring so here goes...  If you think eating a big bowl of Pho is perfect after a night of heavy drinking, imagine that satisfaction...TIMES A THOUSAND when you're eating a bowl of hot, delicious ox tail soup!  Never again will I go to Vegas w/o getting my soup fix here =)  The broth is deliciously salty and perfect, with generous portions of tender meat that falls off the bone.  (I love it when people aren't sheisty with the meat!)  They serve it with cilantro and tons of minced ginger and served piping hot.  Ask for chili on the side and dump your rice in the soup and mix and *sluuuuuuurp* GET YOUR CHOW ON.  Only $9.95 and served only at night...only catch is the time so don't forget.  Starts at midnight until 6am PERFECT for the after spot.  I love (method man voice) THE CAAAAAL!  Sure, it's packed w/ senior citizens but who better to gamble next to than some veterans??   Pit bosses and dealers here are AWESOME too friendly and chill... They comped us 3 FREE SOUPS when we spent a few hours playing blackjack =)   that was the best $100 bowl of soup I've ever had!  (get hawaiian shaved ice upstairs w/ vanilla ice cream yum for dessert)

"What Dust???"  I am stuck at the crappy Tropicana Hotel here in Vegas on a TKD tournament.  Of course crappy hotel equals crappy restaurants.  Last night after a few drinks my friends and I went here to grab a bite...while we were eating the waiter starts VACUUMING around us!  I understand we're not eating at the Bellagio or Wynn but come on even Denny's don't pull this kinda crap.  So I politely asked him if he could wait until we were done with our meal which he replied, "Well I have to finish this area."  The Manager came (old, crusty white lady) and when I told her the vacuuming caused dust and ruined my meal she said, "What dust?"  WHAT DUST!?!?  The crap I'm breathing in between my bites bitch!  Manager then said, "He needs to work his shift and finish vacuuming" and basically didn't care about customer service.  I could've raised hell but I decided to save my breath.  I plan on writing a letter to the hotel restaurant department as well as the health department instead.  STAY AWAY!  There's a Deli in this hotel that is tucked away in the corner that serves pizza, hot sandwiches and stuff...and the workers are SWEET and POLITE!

Deserves the Big "O" Award  I've found my new favorite restaurant to dine in when in Vegas!  Loved the atmosphere- very  casual with a splash of class with the outdoor dining.  Went with a group of friends so I got to taste a bit of everything so here's my 2 cents:  actually, I'm not gonna waste time talking about other dishes...  Cut to the chase- here's what to order:  Fried Pizza Dough, Caprese Salad, Braised Pork Shoulder with Smashed Fried Potatoes and Sauteed Squash.  Pizza Dough:  Curiously shaped these strips of fried dough have the perfect chewy texture and is topped with shaved cheese and pepper flakes.  Simple yet addicting =)  Caprese Salad:  Yummy tomato slices with this soft gooey mozzarella like cheese on top!  It was so good I would play bloody knuckles for the last slice =)  Braised Pork Shoulder:  Huge, thick piece of pork meat that's so tender and soft that is glazed with this delicious apple reduction and cucumber slices.  Honestly, the pork was so good I didn't even realize there were cucumbers on that pig!    The sides were AMAZING:  Fried Smashed Potatoes were something new that I'm a fan of....little red potatoes baked soft but the outside is lightly fried and crispy with this incredible salty slightly spicy kick!  Zucchinis were sauteed in butter and garlic- enough said!  What NOT to order:  Pizza (why waste $ on something you can everyday?!), Butternut Squash appetizer (tasted flowery), pasta margherita DOC (it was too salty).  My friend had a bite of my pork and said, "Ohhh, the chef made love to that dish!" and my reply was, "If that's the case this pork had some multiple O's!"  Seriously guys, it was TOO GOOD!  *sigh*  Now I'm sad....talking about this restaurant and being 3 hours away sucks.  If you're in Vegas please try San Marco out.  The staff are wonderful and atmosphere is chill w/ lots of people watching.  I think I'm going to plan another Vegas trip- just to eat here again!

Inside the Rio Hotel...  I'm sick.  So I got the shrimp wonton soup.  It was good.  But small.  My brother got the combination fried rice.  It was good.  But small.  For $11-12 a dish it should either be fan-freaking-tastic yummy or be served in bigger portion.

BOMB PASTA  Order the chicken parmigan spaghetti it's the best I've had so far!  They flatten the chicken breast and bread it in panko and lightly fry it so it's crispy and delicious!  The pasta is served al dente perfectly.  If you go during lunch special hours it's worth it at $14 a plate.  Plate is bigger than your face so you can share =)  They also have a separate menu for small dishes $3-7 a plate.  Great for those who just want to put something in their tummy to soak up all the alcohol!!!  No dress code, I saw girls in bathing suits walk in from the pool.  *shrug* we're in Vegas I guess anything goes!

I came here because Studio Buffet was packed and I was pleasantly surprised.    The elevator takes you up to the very top and when the doors open you feel like Alice in Wonderland...it's dark, sensual and inviting.  The view of Vegas in the distance is a great backdrop while dining.  We sat at the bar and watched knicks vs heats game for happy hour.  Tomato and buffalo mozzarella salad was delicious!  Slices of red and yellow tomatoes with thick slices of soft cheese and the balsamic vinegar was made into a sweet glaze.  It came with these crunchy flattened parmesean cheese crisps.  Order this!  Kobe sliders and fries were good.  Fries are shoe strings which I don't like because they tasted like chips.  They give you 2 sliders for$ 10 happy hour.  Sushi platter for 2 really should be for 1 because you're going to have to fight for them rolls!  I expected it to be typical cheap fish but the pieces were fresh and rolls enjoyable.  This too $10.  Shrimp cocktail came with 4 gigantic shrimps.  Can't go wrong but $15?!  I give em 3.5.  Spending $60 here felt like a ripoff because I can't help but to compare em to the buffet downstairs which is so much cheaper for quadruple the amount of food.  But Veloce has a nice ambiance and smoking patio outside for those who wanna just go check it out =)

Wicked Idea!  Bomb buffet with a twist; items are placed in cute lil pots and kettles! Great for sharing!  Another pat on the back for wicked...they have a unique menu!  A lovely array of gourmet oohs and aaahs that will leave you highly impressed.  Few things I tried: chicken pot pie, braised short ribs with sweet berry glaze, mushu taco, spinach risotto, mac n cheese with toasted crumbs, some cod dish, clams, mushroom ravioli, sushi etc.  They all came in these adorable little pots and serving dishes =)  Everything was extremely rich and flavorful!  Dessert looked a lot better than it tasted but again, I was impressed. Gold flakes sprinkled on top, the dessert bar looked like Willy Wonka's factory! Choc covered strawberries and mini candy apples were a hit.  I went for lunch and it came out to $22!  VERY IMPRESSED =)

QUICK AND TASTY SEAFOOD   I like how it's a "fast-food" seafood joint. Here's the goods and bads:  Lobster grilled cheese was bomb. Totally worth the price it was cheaper than lobster roll.   Lobster Roll Connecticut style: really good! The lobster meat was chunky and abundant. Heads up this roll is pretty small. Much smaller than the pictures but it's still filling. But if you're a big dude order two.   Difference between Maine and Connecticut is the Maine is cold lobster and Cont. is warm lobster in butter sauce.  Lobster Mac and Cheese: thick shell pasta, cheesy and delicious! A good amount of lobster meat.   PASS:  Lobster Bisque: more like Lobster WATER!!! Bisque is usually thicker and have chunks of lobster and veggies but this one here was the opposite. It was straight watery lobster soup. Skip it.  Blueberry lemonade was sweet and yummy!  Tip: if you add a combo you can substitute the drink for a beer for $2 more!  PS. As you can see by  my picture the lobster rolls are pretty small.  But what I'm confused about is why our rolls didn't come with the huge claw meat on top like all the other pictures show???  Manager should be alerted that this place isn't consistent.

KIDS MEAL WINNER  If you're a girl (or eat like one) save a few bucks and get the kids meal. The fries are normal size, so is the soda and I think the burger is too!  See my pic for size :)

MOST EXPENSIVE PHO I'VE EVER HAD  I love this buffet. It seriously kicks all them other buffets ass out of the water. Why?  1. HOT crab legs! Others got them cold but here you can ask them to steam em up.   2. Huge variety of cuisine! Even the Asian food tastes good and not like Panda Express filler!  Mexican station is fancy and delicious too.   3. Delish dessert station! Everything is good here. I mean it. The gelato flavors are unique (habanero mango?!), the crepes are fresh, cookies and cupcakes baked perfectly and it goes on and on. Other places have one or two yummy items and rest is crap but not here!  4. Home made PHO!  Best hangover cure - c'mon when you're in Vegas you know there's going to be some drunkies who will appreciate this one!  5. No lines! You punch in your name and number and they will text you when you're table is ready! Genius! Go gamble or hit up the bar and waste more money haha  I love it here. It's pricey but worth every penny. When paying your $50+ bill just think- that's like one hand at black jack or a few shots at the club!

NOT BAD FOR EATING AT THE AIRPORT  Chicken: flavorful and crispy if you're lucky. Some of the thighs weren't as crispy which sucked.   Waffles: average tasted like Roscoes. Only negative was it was soft because it came in a to go box the steam ruined the exterior.   Gravy: they have two types. The white gravy with sausage was delicious! The LoLo gravy has onions which we passed on.   Mac and cheese: pretty good. It's the dry thick version which is my fav.   Corn bread: very dense and semi-moist. Only the center was soft. The exterior was pretty hard and dry.   I think had we gone to the real LoLo's we would've had better prepared food. But I still gave it a 4 star for it being pretty tasty at the airport.
