horrible customer service. waited 20 minutes to get my eyebrows done as a walk-in. they kept telling me just two minutes. they took 6 people ahead of me. so i stood up a collected my keys and wallet from the chair next to me and they didn't say a word so i just walked out. and there was dust everywhere. will never go back!  if i could post no stars, i would.

This resort used to be an apartment complex. The mailboxes are still there, half of them hanging open. There is a hot tub and two pools, usually just one is open. There is always enough parking. No elevators. Jim at the front desk was very nice. He offered for security to take up my bags for me since there were no rooms available on the first floor.   My boyfriend and I were visiting for a week to check out apartments in the area, so this was good for us. But, if I were to visit here for a vacation, I'd be very let down!  The room was pretty darn dusty, there was a ring in the toilet bowl, the bed had crumbs under the covers and the bathroom smelled like mold. You have to pay for wifi which I think is absolutely ridiculous this day in age.  I probably wouldn't stay here again. It could have been a lot worse, but it easily could have been much better.

Do not stay here!!!  Filthy!  Overpriced!  Had two hookers smoking the reefer and doin the do in the room next to us. So, it was difficult to get any sleep.   We told management and they said there was nothing they could do about the smell of pot.  Last I checked, it waa illegal. But, hey, it is Vegas.

I drove to Plato's Closet which is next door to Pita Jungle to sell some clothes and they told me there would be a 45 minute wait. So, I decided to head over to Pita Jungle. I asked if they had a happy hour and to my delight,  the bartender said yes! Their house wines are $3 and the glass is pretty big amd they definitely fill it up. I ordered the hummus trio (oh, did I mention it's only $1!!??!?!?) off their happy hour menu and it was delicious!! I also got an order of their garlic lemon chicken (for $2!!!) which was also yum yum yummmayy!! I highly recommend pita jungle! ESPECIALLY this location because of TYLER, MY AWESOMEEE SEVER/BARTENDER/AWESOME PERSON, LAUREN and DANI !! Awesome service and awesome personalities!!! Oh and awesome food!! ;)

beware!!!!!!  (i do not live here, but my boyfriend does. and i have experienced this company's bs firsthand. so, i feel like i have the right to review it.  i will be so happy for him when his lease is up. this place adds a ton of unnecessary stress to your life!!!)   if i could give zero stars,  i would! !  this apartment complex is terrible. management doesn't care about their residents. they are rude and it takes forever to get a maintenance request taken care of.   the worst thing about this place is the fact that they have a deal with a towing company, kwiktow, where they have the tow trucks randomly drive around the parking lots and tow residents cars. this happened to my boyfriend's car. he got home and not even an hour later went back outside to find his car was towed. they are supposed to give you a warning before towing your car. he had been parking in that spot for nearly 6 months with no problem. the assigned parking spots they give you are farrr awayyyy from your front door. so, many residents make agreements with eachother to trade spots so that they can park closer to their apartment. the apartment complex is clearly just money hungry!! i mean this is supposed to be your home, a place where you feel safe and comfortable. not a place where you have to constantly worry if your car will be there when you go off to work in the morning.  the water bill is always ridiculously high because their sprinklers are broken and flood the parking lots. why should residents have to pay for that??????  there is something wrong with the plumbing in my boyfriend's apartment and both toilets overflow at their own free will. he has come home to find the toilets overflowed all over the floor. he called the office and told them about the emergency and they say oh we're so sorrrry we are sending someone right away! but guess what? every time it happens, he has to keep calling them back. he has waited up to 2 and a half hours to finally get someone to fix it. but they don't even really fix it. hence, why it keeps happening. they once had an actual plumber come and look at it and he said something needed to be done or else it was going to keep happening.  the plumber told the maintenance man that they needed to put a camera down the line and the witch in the office apparently decided against it. just hours later, it happened again. one time it happened at night and he called the emergency maintenance line again and again and left messages with no response whatsoever. not even in the morning did they call him. he had to call and bug them til someone came. so he had to go use a public restroom.   not to mention. when my boyfriend was at the office with beth signing the lease and all, she asked him what day he wanted to move in.  he told her he was unsure and that the date might change due to his busy work schedule. beth told him that it was fine and that he could change it no problem but to just choose a date.  so he did. when he called her to switch it to a few days later she then told him he would still have to pay prorated rent for the original move in date because you are not allowed to change your move in date. so, in other words, she straight up lied to his face. thennnn, when it came time to move in, she didnt have the keys made. which is ridiculous considering they should have been ready for the first move in date.  i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy!!!  stay away!!!! highway to the danger zone! !!

Awesome place. Julie the bartender was awesome. The food is excellent. Highly recommend! If you work at the mall they give you a ten percent discount which doesn't hurt haha. But discount or not, this place has verrrrrry good pizza and I'm allowed to make that judgement because I am from New York and I know what good pizza is haha.
