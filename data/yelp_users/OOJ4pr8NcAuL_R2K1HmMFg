Horrible service!! Co worker and I went for lunch we literally work 2 minutes away from this location and we barely made it on time back and we didn't even get to eat anything! I couldn't believe how long it took them to bring out a simple cheeseburger out and a salad. I will defiantly not be returning here!

I've been coming here for at least 8 years now. It's actually my mother and father's to-go spot for Chinese food. They love it here!That being said, if you prefer a small intimate restaurant with not many people there this is your place. I've has lots of Chinese food in my lifetime but I can honestly say the small "home like"  environment is what I prefer but others might consider it a "hope in the wall" restaurant. Tip: sometimes the hole in the wall spot are the best!! The locations works perfect for us because it's in a plaza and there is a big lots a few stores down. We like to have dinner then walk over to big lots for a little shopping. Anything you order is great. My favorite has to be the shrimp and vegetables in the brown sauce comes in a combination plate with fried rice, crab puff, fried wing, egg roll, and my absolute fav egg drop soup. I've had their soft noddles, orange chicken, and a few other dishes and all have great sauces and great flavor! And all in reasonable prices!! Above all this, gotta say their customer service is beyond awesome! Waitress knows us, she knows what we like, and never fails to make us feel welcomed every single time! It's defiantly a gotta try! ;)

This is my to-go-to sushi spot. Great location on bell road. The place itself is pretty small and intimate which usually is what I tend to like. They have really cute patio...by cute I mean it has a little romantic vibe to it. Great place for a date night or just to hang out with the ladies.   The food here is pretty good. My usual is the spicy tuna roll and Mexican roll with miso soup of course. They just changed their happy hour which is awesome because Monday-Thursday is happy hour all day! Now who wouldn't love that?!  With all that being said, the only thing I wish they would work on is customer service. For some reason the last past 3 times I've been here I tend to feel rushed. Servers are polite but I feel like they just want me to hurry up and eat then leave right after. I hope this changes because I truly like this place and wouldn't want to go else where for sushi. Till next time Tokyo Lobby!

OMG god am I glad I only live 5 minutes from here! Can I just live here and eat here everyday?!? I'm so serious this place blows my mind away!!! It's so ridiculously good! It's really intimate and when you first walk in you may think you are walking into any other hole in the wall Vietnamese joint but boy are you in for a treat! Anything you get on the menu I guarantee will be great. I highly recommend the spring rolls on the appetizer section, it looks like a condom with a bunch of veggies and shrimp and beef stuffed inside but it's amazing! Also if you have never tried pho before this is a great place to do so. I love seafood so I always get the shrimp and beef pho and it never disappoints me. Customer service is great! They are always on their toes to make sure you are pleased! This place absolutely deserves a 5 star. It's a must try!!!

Great location! Pretty busy on a Saturday night probably because of the asu game. They changed things since the last time I was here about 4 months ago. Now they give you these "name cards" where u write your name and just give it to the cooks. Guess I don't mind that much I got food much faster that way. I was pretty excited about making my shrimp bowl till I read the sign they just added stating that they are currently going thru a Shrimp shortage at the moment. You don't even get to sample the sauces any longer. That was another cool thing I loved about this place. WTF I was truly disappointed. Also I felt a little rushed. Not even ten minutes after I received my food the waitress handed me the bill. Not as pleased this time but I guess I'll give then another shot. Hopefully next time they'll have shrimp!
