My family and I love the Phoenix Zoo! Yes its hot and yes its a lot of walking but it is still fun to go to!   Did you know that you can take your bike or Rollerblades and ride or sk8 all over the zoo. Its a fun way to see all the animals and its great exercises.   The Orangutan sanctuary will be open very soon and that is going to be something to see! You can also pet stingrays and feed them in their open habitat. There is also a petting zoo on the west side of the facility. It is full of goats and the kids love to look at all of the collars to find out the wacky and fun names the workers have given them.   The food is eh, but you can bring your own food and have a picnic right on the grass in front of the giraffes or at one of the many picnic areas around the park. They do have pretty good snacks and dessert type food at the food stands, which are everywhere!   All in all this is a great place to come relax or go exploring and have a great family outing or a 1st date! Give it a try!

Hey CLEATS you guys are great! Thanks for having everything that we need for our 7 year old Football player even though its not Football season!   What a concept, carry equipment even when its not in season! Great idea. I think the other large chain athletic places ( sports authoricrap and DICKSucks sporting goods) should take a Que from you! THANKS!   4.5 stars in my book...Took away one little stare because you all didn't have the exact size we needed but had one close enough! And my kid is tiny so its not your fault i am sure!

What can I say? Famous Dave's is my favorite BBQ place in Az! My wife son and I where there the other day and we got the All-American BBQ Feast half size only like $33.00. It feed all 3 of us and we took home leftovers for the next day!    Freaking sause... Their sause is so good! I was putting a bottle of the Sweet and Zesty in my wifes purse and got cought. The nice Waitress (Alicia) then reminded me that I could purchase a bottle for only $3.50 more!  Cha-ching and I dont have to go to jail for stealing BBQ sause. Although it would have been worth it!   St. Louis-style spareribs, Chicken, Georgia chopped pork (or Texas beef brisket which you can add for a few $$$ more) , Corn Bread, Corn on the cob, Beans, coleslaw, and Sause!  What a day.... what a day!!!!

This game stop is my fav. Every time I go in here there is a really good and knowledgeable worker behind the counter with lots of suggestions for me on new games! Great prices too!

Man I love a good chick-fil-A sandwich! The secret is to put the Polynesian sauce on the sandwich! Mmm-mm good! This Chick-fil-A is a really nice and neat location and it has a really cool kids area! (in its own room so noise is at a minimum) Give it a try! Not open Sundays!

Freddy's is the type of place you want to drive out of the way to go eat! I love the burgers and the shoestring Fry's are in my top 3 fav to eat!   This is a must go restaurant! If you think Smashburger is good then go get a real burger at Freddy's and experience a burger worth talking about and savoring!   The custard, although sounds kind of weird to eat, is awesome! Just try any one of the flavors and you will see why this place gets a 5 star rating from me!

This is a great Salon!  Whenever I am in the area I stop and have Alecia Biggs/Brown (haha) cut my mop and she is awesome!!!  All the other stylist there are great as well. DollyRockers is really on the cutting edge (no pun intended) when it comes to their technique and products.  The inside of the Salon is really cool and fresh. The front desk is always on top of everything and they are always on time with appointments. The prices are right there in line with any other Salon but why go to another salon when DollyRockers is the BEST!?!  Give 'em a shot, they kick butt!

I had a great time at R.T. O'sullivan's last night for St. Patrick's day! Green beer, a yummy corn beef sandwich and live music, what else do you need?! Our waitress was doing a pretty good job for how freaking busy it was and the food came pretty darn fast! So all in all good times!

My wife son and I go here often to get breakfast and lunch. Although lunch is good, the breakfast is much better. I recommend the Bacado, it is a really good omelet with bacon cheese and avocado! It is the best thing on the menu. Plus they have Gun Slinger hot sauce which is the greatest hot sauce known to man! (you can buy Gun Slinger in the store now at frys)

I love going to the drive in! Its so fun and cheep! Plus you get to see 2 movies for the price of one and there not crap movies. We like to back our truck up, open the back, put all of the food and drinks out and then sit on lawn chairs. The kid(s) can stand up and stretch and have a great time.   There is a concision stand where you can buy food, candy and drink if you forgot stuff, but bring your own if you can. Also bring a little boom box for the radio station so you don't have to waste the battery in your car. We saw some people having to get jumped the last time we where there because they had their car radio on for like 4 hrs and it died.   Go give it a try its really fun and worth the $6 to get in!

Ok so I know everyone loves this place but I don't get the big deal!?! Yes the burgers are good and they have fried pickles but its not better than In N Out! Plus its freaking expensive!!! I recommend going just to say you've tried it and then go somewhere else like In N Out or Freddy's Custard and Steakburgers!

So my wife loves loves loves BBQ food and It was her birthday dinner so I took her to The Hammered Hog BBQ hall and saloon. (for the 1st time) Now we live 1 mile away from Famous Daves BBQ and HHBBQ is prob 12 miles away but i thought we would try a new place out.   NOT impressed! The food was greasy and the BBQ sauce was not up to par. Our ribs were over cooked and the corn bread was as dry as the sierra! Our 7 year old son wen along with us there were no kids menus or anything for them to draw on or color with. The pulled pork was OK but not great.   In other words don't waste your time! Go to Famous Daves BBQ and get some of the best BBQ in the state!   Service was good people were nice but not worth the drive!
