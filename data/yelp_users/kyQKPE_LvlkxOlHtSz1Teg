This place is on point! I give it 5 stars for some simple yet great reasons:  -Food comes out fast and fresh! -It's not pricey. -the chicken teriyaki is so good, I get the large which comes with enough rice and chicken that I can't finish (I'm 6ft, 275lbs).  All around good flavor and plenty of food, much better then a Panda Express or other fast chain.   Great ppl working there that are friendly and helpful.   Go in there, nom nom nom!

Steak and potatoes with sour cream nom nom nom I drive out of my way on Saturdays to get this culinary treat lol all the meat taste fresh, food is never stale or dry, and I like the mild salsa. Worth a try if in the area and don't let the "shack" look fool you, it's clean great food by very nice owners.

Horrible! Came in there for lunch, me and wife ordered: I got fajitas and she got half a turkey sandwich  My fajitas Come to the table and no half a sandwich for her....time goes by no food, bartender then ask how the food is, I reply she didn't get hers,he goes huh, then instead of checking on it goes to take other orders and chat with customers   I finish my food and still nothing for her,he finally goes to check comes back and says "they need to make it from scratch" a half a turkey sandwich needs to be re made,how'd someone mess it up, then finally after long wait he brings it out after they've cleared my plates.   Had to get it to go after that due to Almost an hour for half a turkey sandwich. Amazing

Pretty good subs. I'm not much of a sandwich or sub eater but this was real good.  Got the supreme: great meats, fresh veggies, perfect oil blends and salt/pepper  Employees at this place were fun, nice and helpful.   I'll be back for sure

Good quick food. The teenagers working the front were friendly and on point. I had two cheese slices and filled me up(I'm big guy 6ft 250lbs) so def not tiny pizza. Very affordable and nice alt to fast food. I recommend this place if your in the area. Look for PIZZA on building.

Just got out the movies and wanted something fast. Go in and it smells amazing. Chicken cooked on grill in front of you. Super nice ppl and food ended up tasting very flavorful. Hit em up after movies. I had chicken teriyaki and pot stickers!

Besides having amazing tacos the ppl working here are friendly. Debit machine went down. I said I'd go get cash,they brought food out to my wife while I was gone and I made sure I went in to pay even tho they didn't sweat it. Carne asada tacos are the best. I had five like a true fatty. Great flavor.super cheap. I wanted to eat so badly I took pic half way thru. Go there and have a good time

I asked for medium well steak tips and I got raw. And when I say raw I mean it was cold and purple in the big pieces. I should have taken a pic but I was too disgusted.   You'd think I'd get a new plate, nope brought me out same steak I had cut in partial half and put back on my plate with now cold hash browns and cold eggs  You'd also think I'd get I don't know discount(I didn't ask) but nope full price on this meal.   I know it's I hop so wasn't expecting fancy meal but make an effort so I don't have non cooked food then cold food.

If you ever want to open up a geek collectible store then take notes from this family owned shop! Every time I go in I spend 1-2 hours just in aww of the massive variety of cool things.   -friendly staff -clean and neat  -exclusives from diff cons/stores/overseas -toys from the past up to current day -new and old comics -video games you can play  -deals  -always helping charities or community -events with local comic artists  Those are just a few of the many things I could say about Mark and his amazing store. I come from Chandler to visit but if you are in the area take the time to go in and enjoy nerd nirvana.

This shop is amazing! Clean, friendly and loaded with talent! Richard Sanchez is so skilled and so humble. After getting a tat from him I won't let anyone else tat me. Realistic, colorful and all around well done art!
