Overrated coffee and overpriced. Tried out this place a few times and have never felt welcome. Go to Sip down the street or LGO for the cold brew instead.

Love this place. Great wine selection. You must have the bruschetta if you've never been.

One of my favorite bars in Phoenix. Fun , laid back, and well priced. Love that they have a shuffleboard table too!

Very disappointed with this gym. I live close by, so I signed up for convenience and I shouldn't have done that. This place is not clean and the front desk is not friendly whatsoever. Today, I walked in and I went to FOUR SEPARATE elliptical machines and NONE of them worked, I thought ok, that's super frustrating so I guess I'll go use a treadmill. The 2 or 3 available all had out of order signs on them. After NOT working out because there were no cardio machines to used, I went downstairs to let them know how disappointed I was. The Three people standing at the front desk said "there is nothing we can do about it" and shrugged it off. What am I paying a monthly fee for here??? I only have a few months with this membership and I am def going to cancel as soon as my year is up.

Staff was friendly and got me in for an appointment the same day! The salon is a super cute boutique and it felt clean, and realaxing. Will def be back!

The crowd was all old creepy drunk men , one was drooling and bragging about how much money he had, and then got kicked out bc he stole my friends iPhone!!!! music was so loud I couldn't think.. bartender was awesome though.

Hate to write a long review but i had a terrible expirience. I have a friend who absolutely LOVES this place. She took me there , and I DO NOT understand why she loves it. There were 3 people working on a friday afternoon. They rushed the girls out that were sitting where we were going to go. Owner said he PICKED a number 5 (most expensive pedicure) for me and I kindly declined and said I wanted a regular one, he laughed and said NO you need this one, I kindly declined again and he was rude the rest of the time, laughing that I had calluses (sp?) on my feet. It was RUDE! He cut my foot with the pumice stone TWICE and made me BLEED! He then proceeded to look at the cuteicule cutter he was using on me and noticed it was DIRTY! He went to the sink and rinsed it off with water and soap, that is not safe/sanitary. It has been 3 days and my nail polish is chipping. I smudged my big toe and when i went back to get one nail fixed, they seemed so irritated and the girl did it in about 1 min. While we were there, a girl came in asking for a eyebrow wax. He made her sit down and wait and made her change chairs about 5 times and begged her to get a mani/pedi, you could tell she was uncomfortable, and so was I. only 1 massage chair was working and owner kept asking for the tip the whole time he was doing my nails!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.I will never ever ever go back here again.

Keep walking. This place had some of the worst service I've ever had.   Reservation for 6 at 6:45. Walk in at 6:40 with no hostess in sight. No servers/managers came up to us. 6:47 rolls around and hostess slowly makes her way up to hostess stand, I tell her we are here for our 6:45 reservation, she rolls her eyes and tells us we are late!!!! we sit down, get our drinks, order food.   2 meals came out way before the others, we did not get the appetizer we ordered, no apology. Meals were ok , nothing great. Server never came by to fill our water, and took a looooong time to help us with any requests. I would not make an effort to eat there.

This is my boyfriend and I's favorite spot. Best cocktails in Arizona and the staff is awesome. I highly recommend sitting in the bar area for the best experience. You MUST order the pig ears, smoked olives and the butterfish. We come once a month!

My boyfriend and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. We talk about it all the time. Food is fantastic and we have had nothing but great customer service. The menu is incredible and the wait staff is knowledgeable. I highly recommend the scallop crudo!!!  PS. Bring a jacket, its a little chilly in there ;)

I ordered a sandwich from this location and I had a dead FLY in my sub! NEVER GOING TO JJs again. Even worse, I called to tell them about it and the kid who answered said "gross!" And put me on hold to get the manager and manager was so rude and disrespectful and didn't offer me my money back or an apology to make things right. Disgusting and rude!

The bartender my friend and I had there a few weekends ago was hilarious and a very talented guy. We told him what we liked and he made us fabulous, off the menu drinks. The atmosphere and music is great. Bitter and Twisted is now one of my favorite places to get a cocktail in all of AZ! The horrible Yelp reviews posted on the wall there are pretty funny too, way to have a sense of humor! Would give more stars if I could:)
