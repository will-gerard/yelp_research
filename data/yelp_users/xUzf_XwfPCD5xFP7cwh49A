I have a medium sized cockapoo that I used to take to Petsmart to get groomed. I was never happy with their service - they would give him the atrocious poodle cute even when I specifically asked not to and I noticed sometimes his breath was still smelly even though teeth brushing was in the package. He was also deathly afraid every time we went to the stark white room in the back of Petsmart.  I was SO happy to have discovered Malinda's. Not only was it much less expensive, they service was amazing! My dog came out looking adorable, following the exact instructions I gave them. He was clean, smelled fresh and even fresh breath. The groomer also found a tiny weed lodged deep in his paw and took the time to tell me how to check for things like that. The place also looked adorable and front desk service is friendly as well. Arthur and I are so glad to have found a new groomer!

Oh four peaks brewery how I love thee...Let me count the ways!  1. Always #1...your delicious foamy, cold beer. There hasn't been one I've tried that I haven't liked. From the kilt lifter to the hefe to the peach...I even  love the oatmeal stout - and I'm very picky about my stouts.  2. You have have the amazing food I want to eat after a good night out. Three words: Beer battered fries. And actually I'll throw in the nachos, too. Both are good actually with or without a good night out.  3. Great atmosphere...it can be intimate, it can be great for parties. Outdoor and indoor seating. Unique and cozy feel, yet open and large. Setting for any of my needs.   4. Amazing beer.  This is probably why four peaks is my go to spot. It's also very affordable, great for the local college students. The pros here keep me from grumbling at the parking space around it and how packed it always seems to be. But, I always leave with a few more good memories, happy stomach and a 6 pack of kilt lifter.

I've lived in Tempe, Tucson, and a few parts in California, but I'm glad Pop Culture is still my home base comic book store. As the name implies, it covers a wide variety of pop culture and entails all the things I love: comics, table top games, figures, posters  and collectibles extending from comic book genres to anime. Plus staff is very friendly, nice and knowledgeable (Marco is the best!). I've picked up some really good series based off their recommendations. Their prices are very reasonable and they've price matched for me some kotobukiya figures for me. They have an active tabletop community, too, which compliments with the huge new place! Thank you Pop Culture for fulfilling all my geek fangirlisms...I'll always be coming back!

After moving here a year ago, I had very little hope in Phoenix being able to satisfy my every Japanese food craving whim - especially after my 4 months stay in Tokyo and 4 years in the LA area where excellent Asian food is in abundance. But then I discovered this little diamond in the rough!  Definitely Sushi Ken's greatest facet is its extensive menu. It has delivered almost everything I've craved that's hard to find here - cold and hot udon, soba noodles, katsu curry, ramen, karage, donburi, sushi and my favorite, Okinawan beer! Granted I would say it's definitely not the best of anything I've ever had (or anything close to it at all), but it does its job at fulfilling my cravings and at a very good price. Sushi is decent and rolls are excellent, especially their $5 roll deals! So far the only thing I've had that I have not liked at all which was the tsukemen which appeared to be just rice noodles in a very light soy based, simple broth.   Overall, it is an excellent local, neighborhood restaurant and very nice staff that allows me to savor my once upon a time in Tokyo life again. Just a little bit.

The park has two parts to it: a nice open grassy area and an agility course. It's very nice and clean with a shaded patio area. My dog and I love it here! I usually go at around 5pm on the weekdays and it is quite crowded.  I never noticed that children under 12 were not allowed, but I've seen children in the area and no one seem to really care. There are plastic doggie bags, water bowls, and scoops available. The only thing to be careful about is that it does not separate small and big dogs....they play in one big area.

If you can stand the strong hipster vibe, this is a very solid place for the fresh roasted coffee lover. Yeah they have decent espresso drinks, but your ol cup o joe is where it's at. At home, I use a v60 and don't mind indulging in some good, fresh-roasted coffee, and this happens to be one of the closest locations in the east valley you can get it at. If you're in the shop, you can choose your beans and method of brew (aeropress, v60 and chemex). If you're unsure of choice, the barista is always happy to answer questions.  As far as a place to spend long hours of work or study, probably not the best due to the huge flux of ASU students, minimal outlets and terrible parking. But in the end, this shop stands out for me because it's huge, a great place to hang out where everyone can enjoy a drink - coffee or beer (they also have a variety of beer on top) and my favorite roaster in the valley.

This little cafe serves up some excellent vegan food for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians...but definitely at a price. I've come here on a few occasions, usually for brunch also some lunch here and there. Everything on the menu is vegetarian/vegan so you don't have to look twice if you're vegetarian. Everything I've had has been very flavorful enough to enjoy eating your guilty free, meatless dish. My favorites have been the supreme burrito which hides the vegetarian part of it very well, and the dragon bowl. I think the entrees here are moderately priced about $15 for larger portions, however their acai bowls and juices are incredibly pricey. $13 acai bowls and $10 juice is ridiculous but that's the price you pay for all organic ingredients. Overall they make healthy and vegan food very tolerable if you can also tolerate a little hipster vibe. Love taking my out of town vegetarian friends here for brunch.

Growing up in California, my family has spoiled me with only the best of Chinese food. I am a little reluctant to search for a good Chinese food restaurant here in Arizona, but I couldn't resist the 30% grand opening deal on dishes I haven't had in a while and crave.  Since it was opening week, the place was packed full and service was in disarray.  The decor was interesting....it was an attempt to turn an open food court into a fancy Chinese restaurant - chandeliers and all. Tacky, but honestly, I think it's amusing and gives it character. However, the location is very loud because it is after all an open food court. The table arrangements are also a little bit too crowded and I found myself almost back to back with the table next to me.  Food was decent and good price with the 30% off. I had the cold salt and garlic chicken, squid with black bean sauce, and the seafood tofu hot pot.  The hot pot was a little bland. It was nice to see them use fresh chicken, rather than packaged. Overall, it tasted decent. Nothing stood out, and nothing was terrible. It was nice to have a little taste of what I miss back in California, but I probably won't be returning here.

My dreams have come true....finally a GOOD hot pot place in the Phoenix area!! (Shabu shabu in chandler is just plain crappy) When my parents dragged me to this place, I thought it would be another Asian hole in the wall place with unimpressive decor and ok to good food for cheap (you know Asian parents). Driving up to the location didn't help my expectations either - Tien Wong being located behind a cheap Chinese food buffet in a dimly lit plaza. I was so surprised!!  The place is so chic - some place I would love to take my friends that might be intimidated by Asian food. As for the food - also very delicious! We ordered the herbal house broth. We asked the waitress how spicy the spicy broths were and she described it as "on a scale of 1-10, it's an 11". So enter at your own risk! (we also asked a table next to us how spicy it was...they said incredibly spicy) If you want to take a taste, you can try to order the ying yang broth (half and half). I incredibly enjoyed the herbal broth and it brought out what I love most about Asian food - a medley of complex yet delicate flavors and numerous spices. In your broth, you have a series of aromatic spices such as anise, along with some flavors you would see in Asian desserts - such an aesthetically pleasing and interesting mixture that goes very well. The unfortunate thing is a lot of the flavors are diluted when they refill your broth with a general broth from a pitcher (given to all tables).  Now what to order...I highly recommend beef tongue. I've had it several places, but this is the first time I've seen it in the Phoenix area and quite delicious here, too! Beef tongue is one of those things that sound like you would never think to be good, but then you fall in love with it. It's very easy to eat! I also enjoyed the shabu shabu beef and ribeye. For noodles, you MUST get the udon. I'm pretty sure there's not too many people out there that don't love udon, and it goes especially well with hot pot. I also recommend the 5 spiced tofu...I seriously need to know how to flavor my friend tofu like this...and the fried mushroom tofu. For those unfamiliar with Asian food, for veggies I recommend bok choy, enoki mushrooms, and white mushrooms. For dessert, the green tea cheesecake was very nice to end on, although nothing to be wowed by.  What's best about this place? $5 for unlimited broth. Each place ~$5 of less for a very good portion. It was $18 per person for a 4 person that included 2 desserts (green tea cheese cake and strawberry cheesecake...$6 per place i believe). They also give you sugar cane drinks after you pay your bill! All in all, delicious, fun, clean and chic hot pot place. Great for groups, although I'm not sure if it's good for 2 people just because the portions are large so you could really only order 2-3 items. Will be taking my friends here, but this time for some Sapporo to go along, too!

Although there are many yogurt places popping up now, what first drew me in was the variety of toppings (the best part in my opinion!).  To my great surprise, there is also a great and larger than average selection of flavors (peach and mango pineapple...mmmm!). The only thing missing are those popping boba balls I've only seen at Yogurtland. The place is cute, trendy and clean. It's also spacious unlike some self serve froyo places. The only thing I didn't like was the strawberry topping was a syrupy canned one rather than fresh. Overall very yummy, fun place to meet, and right next to my house. Love it!

Welcome to the epitome of Americanized Asian food. Ham? Pepperoni? Maybe for the confused. And the sauces - the god awful sauces I could probably buy in an overpriced bottle in the "Asian" section of Safeway. They were loaded with too much sugar. I tried the "Mongolian BBQ sauce" which was really actually cleverly disguised Texan BBQ sauce - lots of cumin in it and pretty much devoid of Asian flavors like hoisin and sesame oils. I also tried the Dragon sauce and teriyaki. Both loaded with sugar.   On top, the bowl they give you for your toppings seems pretty tiny. I couldn't pack the meat plus the vegetables I wanted. The actual bowl that is served is huge because they load it with noodles. The ratio should have more vegetables like cabbage and bean sprouts and lower on the noodles.   Oh, you can also get your BBQ wrapped in a burrito too. OK.  At least service was good? Pretty much it's only saving factor. I'm pretty sure Panda Express has less sugar, and at least their food doesn't consist of pepperoni (Truth: I love Panda Express). The fact that this people think this is Asian food makes me die inside a little.

Wow what a pleasant surprise in Tempe for some legit Japanese food. Not to be a ramen snob, but I set my expectations pretty low for ramen joints in the US...but I take it for what it's worth. I like to base ramen places on how good gyoza is at the place. Gyoza and ramen go hand in hand like yakitori and beer. So I was very happy to have some perfectly lightly pan fried gyoza. There are several types of ramen: shoyu (soy base), miso, shio (salt base), and tonkotsu (pork base). Tonkotsu is my favorite and I was not disappointed. Best part it comes decked out with all the toppings and an egg which I'm used to paying extra for.   Service was pretty slow but it seems like a newer restaurant and we did come on a Friday night. Still no excuse to wait 20 min for water after being seated. Also for an izakaya I'm surprised there are no sake choices other than the house sake.  Overall, not the best I've ever had, but definitely pretty legit Japanese food with some izakaya food too. I can't wait to come back and try the yakitori and karage I miss from Japan! Dozo!

**Update: there are two menus here, a menu catering to more "American" taste items and one with authentic Vietnamese vegetarian. This review is for the Vietnamese menu**  Warning: if you like super clean, wanna-be fancy ikea decorated restaurants and don't like authentic Vietnamese food...this is not the restaurant for you!  I think Vietnamese vegetarian food is incredibly underrated and very over shadowed by more popular dishes like pho and spring rolls. With a large Buddhist population, Vietnamese make some of the best vegetarian meals, although I admit I am slightly biased. Even if you're not vegetarian like me, you would be considering it if you tried Vietnamese imitation meat.  After moving from socal, my expectations for Arizona Asian food is very low, but this place surprised me! It's actually one of the best Vietnamese vegetarian restaurants I've been to, and very comparable to homemade food (sorry grandma!). Yes, it's a bit hole in the wall, but who cares? Bun Mang Vit was absolutely delicious and highly recommended. Other dishes I tried were very good, too, like the mi xao gion (crispy noodles) and com tam (broken rice). Great variety of dishes, good portions and delicious food.

I'm SO happy Pieology has followed me all the way from Fullerton (home to the OG Pieology) to Phoenix after my big move. Pieology was my college godsend providing me with 2 meals for the low price of $8, and now it has come to support me post-grad. Great thin crust pizza, check. Customizable, quality, not to mention unlimited toppings, check. Price that a broke college student can afford, check. Overall it's a great quality pizza you can have exactly your way, and it's a bang for your buck.
