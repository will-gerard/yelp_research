Just finished my first meal at Mon Ami Gabi. I liked it. I would go back. The seared salmon over peas was great. The service was attentive, and the atmosphere was great -- very lively and varied. I could see the Belagio and its fountains erupting across the street. Lots of fun.

Maybe my son and I have different tastes than most of the reviewers or ate here on an off night. Our experience was that the decor, menu, service, and presentation were all great, however the BBQ was tasteless. We ordered the Whole Hog to share. It included two types of ribs and two meats. The meats were all beautifully prepared, fall-off-the-bone tender, looked great, and then very little taste except for the sweet sauce on everything.  Maybe we are BBQ-spoiled living in Texas.
