Great place to go for some Chicago style dogs. The price is a little steep for what you get. Also, don't expect fast service here, but that is understandable seeing as how they cook everything fresh.   On a bad note, the last time I was in I ordered a brat and I asked for sauerkraut , BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY!!!

Have been to this rally's multiple times and it just gets worse each time. The food is always delicious but the service is terrible. Always takes way too long even if you're the only one there. The employees are always rude and could care less about your order. The condition of the building and parking lot is horrible. Be warned there is a giant pothole as you enter the drive thru!!

Just got my third tattoo done here today. I always go see Tony and love his work. Very clean and presentable shop with plenty of room to move around. All the staff are very pleasant and accommodating. Tony is always straight forward and honest with his ideas and concepts. He will always make sure what you want done is something you will want for the rest of your life. Be sure to call ahead and get a consultation so that you will be able to get your work done!! Thanks again Tony!!

Newly remodeled and looks amazing! The selection here is awesome. Everything from organic produce to a fresh sushi bar. The staff here is very friendly and always helpful. Prices are very reasonable and weekly sales are a great deal.  Definitely this is my favorite local grocery store. Will always come back!!

Stop by here every so often for a quick bite to eat. Food is always decent, fair prices, and pretty good service. The only issue I really have is that they can be pretty slow with the orders sometimes. Staff is usually friendly and apologize about the wait, but it happens way to often for my liking.

This place has gone downhill since my last review. The service is even slower than before and the food quality is poor at best. Also, most of the card readers at the stalls don't work. Such a shame as this place was right down the street for me.

If you're looking for a fine dining experience this is not the place for you. That being said, I love going here if I want a cheap, hearty, and greasy breakfast. I have to agree with some other reviewers, it does take some salt and pepper for flavor, but still good.

After driving by this place several times and wondering about it I finally stopped in for dinner the other evening. To start the decor in this place is ghastly! I get that they are going for the antique/historic vibe, but there are better ways to go upon it. The smell of this place is... Interesting. A mix of old people and stale food. Which brings me to the food.... bland, boring, mushy, cold, slop. I understand they are catering to there demographic (the 65 and up crowd) but the food was just awful. Service was outstanding however. Our waitress was very attentive and got everything we needed very quickly. Definitely won't be back anytime soon though.

This place is my go-to for tasty and cheap Asian food. The menu is huge (about 20 pages) and it's split up by style and origin. So far the hot and sour soup and the orange chicken are my most favorite. The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is because of the service. Most of the time you walk in and nobody says a word to you so I've learned to just seat myself. When the waitress finally gets over to your table they are very nice. However, the time it takes for you just to get your food and drinks is a bit too long. It seems to me that it is an understaffing issue. There is usually only 1-2 servers when the place is packed.   Just a heads up the regular portion size is plenty for me to be full and have lunch leftovers for the next day.

Stop by here all the time for some sweet pork nachos. The food here is soo good and reasonably priced for the huge portions. The setup is like a chipotle. You walk down the line and pick out what you want. The only downside to this place is the long lines. Every time I'm here the line is practically out the door and it moves very slow. The employees here seem to always have a lack of training and motivation. Be prepared to keep an eye in which plate is yours because they will not know. Some systems to ensure proper flow of the line would be very useful here.

I have to give this place 2 stars solely based on my most recent visit. Normally, I get the orange peel chicken and it has always been good! Recently I've been on a tofu kick so I decided to give the tofu here a try instead of chicken. BAD CHOICE!!! The tofu came out in thin little burnt strips. I also tried the hot and sour soup which was also a disappointment.

Amazing place to go for breakfast!!! I've been here several times and the food is always amazing. The service is very quick and friendly. I highly recommend the Monte Cristo, it is definitely the best item on the menu. Just a heads up, there is parking right in front of the restaurant. It seems confusing because there are signs by the street directing you to a dirt lot across from the property.

This location is currently closed and will reopen on December 16th as a Panera Bread!! They do have a tent on their patio everyday until then. They are giving out free samples of pastries, coffee and hot tea. You can also sign up for a new myPanera loyalty card and get 30 days of free drinks when they reopen!!

I have visited this place several times in the past. They have a decent happy hour and daily specials. But after my last visit, I will never be back!   A couple of friends and I stopped in last night for some late night happy hour sushi and drinks. The service in the past has usually not been the best. However, this time our server, Tony, was actually on point.  I ordered my usual Fire Cracker dish and a friend ordered the chicken gizzards. His food was okay but he literally pulled out about half a cup of slivered garlic pieces. WAY TOO MUCH GARLIC!! Mine tasted fine as usual so not too bad there. Our bills were a reasonable price for all we got. So we left fairly happy with our experience.   The reason I am giving this place only 1 star is because of the torture I went through after getting home from dinner. I got the worst food poisoning I have ever had to deal with in my life. I had to make a trip to urgent care this morning after being glued to the toilet all night!   Thanks a lot Saketini!! I won't forget this experience for quite some time.

Have driven by this place a few times and decided to stop in today. A nice little cafe with indoor and patio seating. Ordered the shredded chicken enchiladas and they were absolutely delicious!! All the staff are very nice and accommodating. The prices are a little high but the portions are a decent size. Left pleasantly full and will definitely be back in the near future.

Love this place!! The selection is vast and not too expensive. Happy hour all day Sunday-Thursday is a big plus. The only problems I have here is that the bartender cannot mix a drink to save his life (just stick with a beer) and if you want your food to-go it costs extra.

If you're going here for "tea" good luck. Not much more than flavoring syrup and hot water. If you want a real cup of tea walk down to Tea Infusion.

For the life of me I cannot understand why people like this place!! Stopped by the drive thru for some lunch today and first thing I noticed was the big CASH ONLY sign on the wall. Seriously, what functioning business doesn't accept cards these days. Get with the times guys. Not to mention they will not accept a bill over $20 (tried to pay with a fifty on a $32 order and was told NO).  Now for the food... gross! I have had better fish and chips in an elementary school cafeteria. The fish was overly breaded and over cooked. The fries were soggy and tasteless. Then, their so called "special sauce" is just watered down ketchup. Nothing very "special" about it at all!  Needless to say, I will not be returning here again. Long John Silvers has better food and better prices.  Oh and service with a smile or at least some kind of emotion would help.

I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! Great food, friendly service, and a awesome atmosphere. I usually get the chicken and dumplings platter with mac n' cheese, hashbrown casserole, and fried apples. Always delicious!!! Haven't really tried much else here (i'm a creature of habit) but I'm sure it's good. Love the country store as well.

I always dread going here every week but as a small cafe we can't afford the high food delivery cost. So what I'm stuck with is this place. They always seem to be out of a lot of their products and it takes weeks for things to get back on the shelves. I've been waiting 3 weeks for 32oz plastic cups and still none available. The quality of the products here isn't bad and reasonably priced. However, I suggest staying away from any Chef's Quality brand items!   The staff here are extremely useless if you need some help. I always get an "I don't know" when asking where something is or if it is in stock. Also, the checkout lines here take FOREVER so be prepared to wait.

Talk about pushy sales people!! Before I was in the door I had already been told to sample 3 teas (which weren't that good). The salesman continued to follow us into the store and was on our tail the whole time. He proceeded to tell us about the other teas, which we were told to sample, and the best way to steep them. I already know quite a bit about teas and the best ways to steep them so I didn't appreciate being "educated" about it. Disappointed that this place doesn't carry very many traditional teas. It's mostly all fruity blends. I only ended up buying something here so I could get my parking pass validated.

I would recommend staying away from this place!!! The food wasn't bad, even though the pasta sauce tasted like tomato paste (no flavor at all). What really makes me not like this one was their horrible customer service. Upon walking in the place I went up to the hostess desk and told her had 4 in my party. She proceeded to throw 4 menus at me and said "Have a seat and we'll get to you whenever we can." About 15 minutes went by and we were shown to our table. We waited another 15 minutes before our waiter came over to take our drink order. He then disappeared for a while. Another waiter brought our drinks several minutes later, and while setting my water on the table knocked it over spilling it everywhere! He then just said "sorry" and ran off. Never offered to clean it up or anything. So we used the napkins on the table to clean it up.   We all then waited about 10 more minutes before the waiter came back to take our order. I asked for the Grilled Sausage and Peppers Rustica. He had no idea what I was talking about!! He didn't even know that was on the menu! As a waiter you should know everything on your menu. He then left to go put our order in. 20 minutes goes by and our food finally arrives. While eating, our drinks empty the whole time, he never comes back to see how we're doing. He finally returns at the end with our check. I then ask him for a to go box. He returns and offers to put the food in the box for me. While putting the food in the box he dumps half of it on the table.   I will never eat here again!!!

Ordered delivery from here after getting an advertisement put on my door. We got a deal for a 2 topping pizza and 10 wings for $14.99, so pretty reasonably priced. The food got to my house fairly quick (about 20 minutes.) The problem I have with this place is that the pizza was TERRIBLE!! Hardly any toppings, burnt crust, cheese only went half way out from the center, and just very bland.   However, the wings were pretty good. Definitely won't get another pizza from here again though.

Tried this place tonight upon recommendation from a friend. This place looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, but is actually quite large on the inside.  Upon arrival we were seated immediately by a slightly dirty guy (his hygiene did need some work). The place seemed very empty for a Friday night. The decor here is pretty run down and dingy. It seemed like they had a nicer section that was blocked off by curtains. Maybe they should use this as the main dining room. The lighting was VERY bright at our table. A little dimmer lighting would be much better.   Overall, however, our food was delicious. The service was rather quick and we enjoyed kind of having the place to ourselves.   Will definitely be back in the future but maybe just for takeout. They also deliver!!!

This place was a huge let down!! If you're going to charge $18 for one person it better be amazing. I was expecting a lot more for the price.

Every time I have been here the food seems old and dried out. Customer service is also a big problem! I went through the drive-thru and the guy barely said two words to me. Just took my money and threw my food at me.

Stopped in here today for a quick cut. After reading many other yelp reviews (all 5 stars) I figured I would give it a try. Got exactly what I asked for and for a great price too! Will definitely be going here from now on.

Last night was my first time at Spokes. I had never heard of the place before but saw a couple in a local flyer and saw that they had 24 beers on tap!!! Sounded like a great place to me.  Be warned this place is not easy to find without any kind of GPS!! There are no signs for it anywhere and it cannot be seen from the street. Upon walking in we were told to seat ourselves anywhere we would like. We chose to be sit over by the bar which overlooked a beautiful patio area complete with a pond. We sat for quite some time before a waiter came over to us (about 10 min). They do have a good selection of beers (I chose the SanTan Hefeweizen) and food seemed to SOUND good. So I ordered the bacon cheeseburger.   The food literally took 40 minutes to get to us. Keep in mind this place was not busy at all. Our food was okay but nothing too impressive for the prices. I had asked for my burger medium rare and it was almost well done. The side of black beans and rice was bland and cold. At this point we were ready to leave but we had another 20 minute wait to get our check.  Overall this place could be good if they changed a few things. Great selection of beers but food is lacking. May give it another shot but doubt it.

This place has a serious draft and bottles/canned beer selection. If you join their Brew Crew you get a t-shirt and a card to track how many different beers you've had. The service is really good! Our waitress and bartender were very helpful and informative on their beer selection. The only problem with this place is the food. Way too overpriced for the quantity and quality of food you get. Will definitely frequent this place for more beer!

This review is based only on their drinks. Have not tried the food yet.  Wanted to try this place out after Tea Infusion closed down. Went in today wanting an refreshing iced tea. Problem is the way they make you an iced tea is by giving you a hot cup of tea with a bag and then a cup of ice. THIS IS NOT HOW YOU MAKE AN ICED TEA!!! Did the ownership not take notes when Tea Infusion was still there? I also ordered an iced chai latte. Also poorly made! The old chai lattes were smooth, sweet and creamy. The one I had today was watered down, chalky and luke warm.   Needless to say if they can't get the simplest tea making down I'm scared to try the food.  And where did all the former staff go?! Miss their friendly faces...

Passed by this place several times after recently moving to the area. Looked like it had a good amount of business most days so it must be good. I was sadly mistaken...  The decor in this place is a bit of an eyesore. There is a bar, some tables and booths, a pool area, what looks like stage for live music or karaoke. Very dimly lit and dirty/grungy feeling.   Our waitress was very odd as well. Not very friendly and didn't seem to have any knowledge of the menu. When asking questions about it she didn't really have an answer. The food is not very good and is an odd mix of Vietnamese, and American Chinese. Every thing the pit group ordered was just bland and lacked any creativity.  Probably won't be coming back...

Love, love, love this place!!! I always get a beef and cheddar croissant with extra sweet peppers and I highly recommend it. The ordering process is a little overdone and confusing at times. The place always seems overstaffed yet it takes longer than expected to receive your food. Still the food is good so I keep going back.

This is my new favorite spot!!! The last time I stopped in for a quick lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly, quick, efficient and accurate the staff all were. The cashier was very thorough with my order making sure that everything was to my liking. They give you a little table locator that tells the kitchen exactly were in the restaurant you are seated. When your food is ready everything is brought out to you. HOW COOL!! You can also place orders frim their iPad stations or from your phone. I will try out the Rapid Pickup next time :)
