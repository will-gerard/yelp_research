I have been salon hopping for over 20 years.  When I finally found Alicia, owner and Master Stylist at Bravo Salon, my luck must have turned.  I showed up with hair the color of a penny, not intentionally, and she was able to get all the brassiness out (which noone was ever able to do), and get my hair to a beautiful beige color and I will never go anywhere else again.  She, and her staff are so knowledeable, consice and extremely educated that I would recommend to anyone to go to Bravo Salon.

Best place to get a car wash, and buy wine, and a cool hostess gift, and sit down for some eclectic cuisine, or a delicious bakery goodie, or play a game of chess...only bad thing is my car wash winds up being $100 :)

Worst experience ever! While my hair was getting washed in sink someone ran a chair over my toe nails and messed up my recently painted toe nails. Yes accidents happen but couldn't even get an apology! Kept saying excuse me you just ruined my polish and instead of saying I'm so sorry I got nothing! Then my hair turned out the color of rust. The stylist insisted I was using hemp shampoo because this happened. Unless Moroccan oil shampoo is made of hemp I don't think so. No water, no coffee, no refreshments offered only a boutique with stuff to purchase. This place seems as if it is completely run by an under experienced staff.

Best place around for a slice or pasta. Owner from Queens where they know how to make pizza. Ingredients are so fresh! You can ever get drakes devil dogs or coffee cakes!!! Yum
