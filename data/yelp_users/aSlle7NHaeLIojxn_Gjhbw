I thought the atmosphere was great, the food was very good and I actually liked the BYOB.  My boyfriend and I went to celebrate a special occasion and we were able to bring a special bottle of wine we had been saving for such an event.  I agree that the food is a little pricey but I think it was very good.  I am not sure what Nita is talking about when she says its like deli food, I didn't get that impression at all.  I will definitely be back for another fun occasion or celebration when I am in Phoenix.

I have been here a few times in the past but not in years.  The other day I stopped in to grab lunch at 1:20pm and was put on a wait list 5 groups long.  The most frustrating part was that their were 5 tables open inside and a full open patio outside.  The cooks were twiddling their thumbs with nothing to do and there were easily 4 employees total just kinda hanging out.  I waited 15 minutes thinking there had to be a reason we couldn't sit in these empty tables and at least sip on an ice tea... but there was not, or at least no one explained to us why all of us were standing inside and out waiting to be seated.  I finally left at 1:37 because I had an appt. I had to be at by 2pm.  I remember the food being decent but i was very disappointed in the lack of concern from the staff that day.

I only enjoy the finer pizza's in life and this place is amazing.  Its more of a grab a slice for lunch or order take out for the family place rather than a sit down dining experience.  The pizza is amazing, I am a vegetarian so I usually hit the regular cheese or the veggie pizza and they are both awesome.  Enjoy!  Go for the big Jimmy... I dare ya!
