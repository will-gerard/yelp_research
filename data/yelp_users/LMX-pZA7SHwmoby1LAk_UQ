this gym is old... yes i get it...  compared to the gyms in cali you get more for your money here... my membership in cail got me the hot buff guys whos stares everywhere but their workout. here there are many people of different age groups and body shapes. the classes here are really good.. when expressing concerns with an instructor they listen... ie body pump .... the staff in the mornings are always friendly (we r always out before 2pm.) sauna pool spa steam room are all fabulous! people here come to work out not gawk at others...

We just finished a beer and spinach and artichoke dip at midnite on a sat nite... Granted it is drunk food but damn it is so nasty ! As in nasty gross ... Wish I could give -5 stars but stuck with a lousy one star ... Fair warning don't eat here

Today was my first time eating here and our waitress Alex was the best! She was really patience with us and answered our questions about the menu.... She really made our first experince memorable!  Last but def not least... The food was really fresh and the portions were big! We got the sharwarma I think thats how u spell ... So delish ! Can't wait to try out more things on the menu... Excited for happy hour!
