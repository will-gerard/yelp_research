Had Spinato's for take out last night. Good service... Ordered the sausage thin crust. The bottom of the crust wasn't very good, could have been cooked longer. Sauce was a little sweeter and didn't have any special flavor. Pizza seemed like it had too much cheese. Not the pizza for me.

We finally visited Si Se√±or after being encouraged by family members. We were pleased overall by the service, and even more pleased by the food. We will return in the future!

We work on a year-round basis with Mike Wolfe. He is excellent to work with - responds promptly to emails and calls, and get a very competitive price without sacrificing quality. I would highly recommend Lang Printing!

I will never, ever, ever go back here again. My purse was stolen. Shows you what type of people frequent there. No thanks.

Took Mom to Windsor for Mothers Day. Overall a great time. Good burgers (beware of the Windsor sauce and ask for it on the side), $5 pitchers of beer and cocktails. Good customer service too :)

Red Embers has some great burgers! I added bacon to mine and they definitely gave me a hearty portion. The burger was super juicy too! The food took a while to come out, so try to patient... Deliciousness is on the way ;)

I finally made it to Sephora a month after receiving a gift card for my birthday. It wasn't very busy when I went which was nice. I was immediately greeted by Andrea who helped me find my make/up forever shade, and recommended nars eyeliner & blush (pricey but the product is excellent). I also tried the Anastasia brow pomade which they were out of completely(!) but she took my number to call me when it comes in. Sephora has a pretty open return policy which is nice if the $36 foundation doesn't work out for you. Overall very great experience, but the size is smaller so the selection is limited. I will be back again!
