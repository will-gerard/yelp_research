Not Good. Lived in Hawaii for 3 yrs. Ate my fair share of plate lunches. Not at all what I expected. First of all, a plate lunch needs good mac salad. This mac tasted like KFC potato salad, (yes.it had potatoes in it). I had the teriyaki chicken. It was a bunch of dried out, day old, chopped up chicken, soaked in some bad costco teriyaki sauce. I can't believe I drove all the way out there for that.   Love Ono's and L&L. Don't think I'll be taking another chance on Aloha.

I've be hearing about this place for a while now, from who else.. my mother. She eats hear every once in awhile with her friends and raves about. Today was my turn. I was her guest and it was great.   A very unassuming, cozy place. To start with, we entered from the back which was kind of the kitchen. I mean, there were people preparing food and making pies, so.. I guess that's ok because I liked seeing where my food was going to be made. It was immaculate, by the way.  The service was excellent. The Hostess and servers were nice and polite, and anywhere that has it's first dollar taped to the wall along side softball team pictures and giant trophies gets big points with me.  My mom had the meatloaf, which she always has, and I had the same. It came with choice of sides. I had irish potatoes,steamed veggies and a salad for starters. Meatloaf was awesome, but go ahead and ask for a to-go container right off the bat.. you won't finish it.  I must say, I was quite satisfied with the meal. To top it off, they played "happy birthday" over the PA and brought out a huge wedge of cheese cake, which I haven't eaten yet. They also took my picture and printed it out on photo paper before we left.  All and all, a good birthday meal at a friendly place.  Thanks.

Best Indian food I've ever eaten. Went there for lunch with a few friends from work for the buffet. Never had much luck with Indian lunch buffets, but this one hit the spot. Tandoori Chicken was the bomb! Chicken thighs and drumsticks.. the best.   Went early, around 11:30am. The food was fresh from the kitchen. About 10 different dishes. I don't know what everything was, but I tried it all and it was all good.   There was a non-stop parade of naan bread of all types. It just kept coming. Seriously,.. it didn't stop. I've been to places where you had to pay per basket of naan. Not here.  The price was reasonable. About $10 for the lunch buffet. Well worth it. I actually called again to see how much take-out was. It sounded a little pricey. $5.99 per lb. The girl on the phone said the typical styrofoam take-out box is 2.5 lbs. This baller is on a budget, so $15 for take-out is not in the question. I'd rather eat that fresh naan anyway.  This place is well worth it. I've already told a few friends about it. I look forward to bringing my wife here on date-night.

Just alright.  Had this baked potato with some of their BBQ brisket on top.  It was OK.

I should take a picture of these wings. Disgusting. I got the ones without the sauce. They looked like little rawhide doggie chews. I'm not even exaggerating. The cheese was weird and the BBQ chicken pizza was horrible. What is worse is that I had too wait what seemed like a long time. It looked like it was all high school kids working there.   I like the Barro's on 7th St and T-Bird. Completely different. Way better. This one is nicer inside but the food is bad. I'm sure they can fix all this. It's just too nice a place.  Message me if you want to see those nasty wings.

This restaurant is beautiful. Hadn't been to Z Tejas in a while.  Food hasn't really improved.  I really like Mexican food, so this place doesn't cut it.

Get that torta. Fresh bread. The best fries. Eat in so you can get the homemade chips. Make sure you pour the green sauce on the torta. Bomb! Sorry no pic. By the time I thought about Yelp, torta was gone.
