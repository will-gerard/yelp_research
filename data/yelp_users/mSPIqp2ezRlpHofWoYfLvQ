I dunno about the food here as I have not attended during normal business hours. Rather, I broke in and robbed the place as a thief in the night. You guys probably saw it on the news. Kidding...well, lying actually.  Instead last year during a business trip to the valley my cousin managed to drag me to this place (he and his boys love this place) one saturday night. I flashed my Texas dl, slipped the doorlady her $20, and was mighty surprised to walk inside and hear the DJ playing some of the hottest R&B and Hip-Hop jams known to man.  OT's on a saturday night is not swanky and posh as many of the spots in say Scottsdale are, so do not expect anything over the top. Rather expect a multicultural urban crowd of twentysomethings simply mingling and grooving to Musiq, Dwele, Kanye West, a good remix here and there, etc.  Nothing incredible on paper, but the music was pretty damn good.

Diamondback Cleaners has satisfied me completely thus far. This week I left six of my best shirts with them and each and every one came back just as I had ordered.   One of them I had gotten considerably dirty (white of course...) and some how they managed to send it back spotless. Granted I pretreated the shirt with goat's milk and pig urine fresh from Myanmar. At any rate, they took care of me.  Their prices are good, they offer same-day service, and they have several locations throughout the valley as well. As long as they do not screw up any of my threads in the future I will most certainly use them exclusively.

So, I have this habit of taking all of my slacks and suits to the cleaners at once and it has never ever came back to bite me in the ass. That was until I found out this past Friday night that I would have to be present for an important meeting the following day and of course I would need to be dressed accordingly as usual. Damn.   It's 8 PM on a Friday evening and I must get a pair of slacks as quickly as possible. I had heard of Burlington Coat Factory carrying KC, RL amongst a few others so I figured I'd give it a try seeing as though I simply needed a basic black slack. The store locator directs me to Arizona Mills Mall as it has the closest Burlington Coat Factory to Chandler, so off I go.  Before I even get inside of the damn store I notice some idiot in a lime green thugmobile actually following me around the parking lot. I'm not talking about the two of us turning down the same aisle either...I am talking about deliberately driving in circles and hitting the same aisle three times only to see this guy's grille in my rearview the entire time. You know, some real Simon Sez kind of bullshit. He had followed me all of the way from Baseline & I-10 to the mall's parking lot only to continue following me, so of course, I am immediately thinking "Okay, what is this sorry bastard thinking of carjacking me or something?"  After finally reaching the point to where I was really concerned and about losing my patience I decide to abruptly park in the middle of the lot surrounded by no one. I sat ready and willing to surprise the shit out of this foolish bastard when he finally decides to go and park up in front of the store near the other cars. He gets out and sees me looking directly at him and clearly judging by his body language he is aware that he has been detected and is being watched.  I watch him go into the mall and purposely walk over past his thugmobile to check his plates. I actually enjoyed this part. Little did I know this would be the high point of my shopping experience at this place. I go inside and see the store packed with people that I want no where near me and a staff and store layout that is clearly oriented towards theft prevention.  And to think I called myself avoiding the hustle and bustle by not going to Chandler Fashion Mall. In hindsight, clearly I would have been much less annoyed had I just taken my happy ass to Chandler Fashion Mall as the congestion there is much more tolerable than what lied ahead at Arizona Mills Mall.  Anyway, I got the damn slacks and got the hell out, but if I could describe Arizona Mills Mall in two words they would be: "Umm, no."

I just tried this place at the behest of a young lady who was craving hot wings of all things (No, we're not expecting) and low and behold the wings were actually pretty damn good.  If I recall correctly they have Mild, Medium, Hot, and Suicide. She chose the Mild while I chose the Suicide (No, we're not expecting, dammit!), yet here I am Yelping about this place, so obviously they weren't that hot...or "suicidal" I mean. But then again I was raised on spicy food, so keep that in mind. At any rate, the taste of the glaze was good...very good.  They also had burgers, hot dogs, and other all-American greats on the menu. The price was cheap and the appearance and cleanliness of this establishment was on point.  I will be going back; I suggest you give this joint a try. No, I don't mean it that way.

Holy shitface, Batman! Today on a whim I decided to take on Camelback Mountain for the first time.  It was quite the "damning" experience.  1) Around 2 PM I arrived and turned onto Echo Canyon to discover a rather long stretch of vehicles in line waiting for parking spaces in a lot that was small at best. That received a quick exclamation of "Damn!"  2) The Echo Canyon trail acension was enough to nearly make a 225 pound grown man cry like a baby. About three-quarters of the way up I found myself in tripod position gasping for air to again cry "Damn!"  3) While in tripod position nearly causing a mudslide as beads of sweat saturated the ground these tight little legs sneak by. I look up to discover this absolutely hot little vixen (conveniently accompanied by her boyfriend) climbing the mountain in tights and a bikini top? Yet another "Damn." only this time I could not help but to laugh...I was tired and she made it worse.  Camelback Mountain rocks...no pun intended.

So today I felt like pushing myself a little so I decided I would conquer Summit Trail at Piestewa Peak as an appetizer before making the short drive over to Camelback Mountain for my main course.  Well the first thing I noticed is that this place is quite different from Camelback Mountain.   Unlike Camelback:  -There are multiple parking lots. The parking spaces themselves are substantially larger. If you're a "car person" as am I then you giggle like a schoolgirl when you see the perfect space to leave your baby.  -There was a considerably lesser amount of hikers on Summit Trail. I suppose this is good if you like the solitude and serenity of man and nature alone. If you're a "people watcher" then I suggest you stick with Camelback.  -The terrain of Piestewa Peak is also noticebaly different. There is a vast amount of igneous and metamorphic rock on the trail making it a hell of a lot rougher on the limbs in the event of a fall. Expect a lot of sharp, angular rocks as opposed to the sandy, more rounded sedimentary rock of Camelback.  -The grade of the Summit Trail at Piestewa Peak is not as steep as Camelback however it is more windy and there are more trails in totality as opposed to the few Camelback has to offer. For leg work accompanied by cardio I suggest Piestewa Peak. For more of a full body workout accompanied by cardio I suggest Camelback's Echo Canyon trail.  By the way, on the walk to the Summit Trail head I encountered a snake. It startled me so I said "Ooh, shit." I guess he could sense my fear as he then stood up and approached me stopping inches from my face. He told me that it was his playground and that he didn't want any nerds on it. I replied that "I was just trying to live my life." He then demanded my lunch money. After I handed it to him he shoved me to the ground knocking my glasses off and ripping my Nirvana t-shirt. The other snakes laughed. It was humiliating. I'm never going back there again!  Okay, sorry. In all seriousness today I did encounter a snake (dark green nearly black with a bright yellow pattern on it's back) that was about 4 feet long. As you enter the park the first parking lot is located on the right. I parked here. Across the road from this parking lot is a trail that will allow you to bypass walking on the main road to access the Summit Trail head. I was walking with my shades on when the Man up above told me to remove my shades so I could see where in the hell I was going. Not even a minute later in the gully to the right of this trail the snake slithers out of the wall of this gully. Again, it was about four feet long, which was enough for me to get my ass up to the actual trail head with a little bit more pep in my step than usual.  Folks: Do your thing, have fun, but pay attention to your surroundings and please watch your kids and your pets. If you have kids take your cellular on the trail with you; better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it.

I love the entire area at Chandler Blvd. and the 101. You got Ross, Lowe's, Office Max, Best Buy, Target, The Vitamin Shoppe and basically any other store or restaurant that you may want to visit all at one intersection.  Then of course there is the Fashion Center. They have the right stores: Guess, Lucky, Express, AF, Banana Republic, Men's Wearhouse,etc. I would like to have seen an Armani Exchange here, however  that is perhaps more AX's doing as opposed to the powers that be regarding Chandler Fashion Center (I personally witnessed Armani take forever and a day to install a store in the sprawling Austin, Texas market). In fact, there isn't an AX in Arizona at all...Go figure.  Last but not least, what I dig most about this intersection (Chandler Blvd & 101) are the various types of eateries. You got P.F. Chang's, California Pizza Kitchen, The Cheesecake Factory, etc...you also have an In N' Out, so the variety is there. I am actually forgetting  a few so, definitely they have the spots to grub to say the least.  I  will deviate from the norm and NOT compare Chandler Fashion Center and it's surrounding area with the Scottsdale Fashion Square and it's surrounding area.....Different demograpics, markets etc. Clearly, It's apples and oranges.   In my opinion it's convenient that the valley offers a short drive between two excellent commercial hubs!

Last week I purchased a new pair of Asics GT-2120s as I have recently changed my running regimen entirely. The Asics GT-2120s are well-known as a great shoes. However for some reason in the short time that I have been using it I have been experiencing some acute soreness in my feet immediately following my runs as well as throughout the days afterward.  I always "listen to my body" so I grabbed the phone book in search of a store that specialized in runner's gear. My search led me to Run AZ as it is closest to my stomping grounds.  Upon finding the store in the shopping center I was somewhat surprised to see that the suite was fairly small in square footage. Upon entering the store I immediately noticed several red and black shoes on the back wall...red and black is my favorite color combination so I was inclined to get a closer look. As I got a closer look I discovered that they had all of the right manufacturers: Brooks, Saucony, Asics, Mizuno, etc. Furthermore, the price range was cool as I saw shoes ranging from $75 to $180.  Well, the sales associate makes his way over and I basically told him about my regimen, past sports-related injuries and present problems with my current shoe of choice. He shared quite a bit of product knowledge regarding my present shoe and had me walk the length of the store and jog down the sidewalk in them.   Taking into consideration the info I had initially provided and what he had visually observed as I walked and ran he then went to the back of the store and returned with several pairs of different shoes that he felt were better for a runner such as myself.  He suggested I try on each respective pair and even had me take them out of the store for a jog as he observed my running mechanics in each. I was totally convinced that he knew what the hell he was doing as not only was he using terms that I hadn't heard since collegiate kinesiology courses and EMT school, but also each respective shoe that I tried on had a much better fit than my Asics GT-2120s.  At the end of the 40 minute visit to Run AZ the Asics GT-2120s had been demoted to the scout team and at the top of the depth chart were the Pearl Izumi syncroPace IIs. I walked out completely satisfied with my purchase and very appreciative of the good customer service, knowledge and expertise that the staff at Run AZ had to offer. I will be going back!  Update: Pearl Izumi manufactures a kick ass shoe! The shoes are comfortable out-of-the-box as they are very lightweight and have unbelievable breathability. As icing on the cake the shoe actually has a "fast" feel to it. Go get you some!

Aight pimps and players here's the lowdown. If you have some kicks that need some lovin' I suggest you take a dip in your Cadillac over to Express Shoe Repair.  I'm not one of these cats that has 50 pairs of shoes; I'd rather have 5 or 6 (1-2 formal, 1-2 casual, etc.) that are right on point in regards to my style and the occasion. While I must admit that I am always cool like the breeze ever so often one of my women may get a little overzealous upon the sight of me and scuff my gators in the midst of their excitement. I can't have this...scuffed gators make you look like the biggest square since Madison.  In the event this occurs, I dip on over to Express Shoe Repair. Mario "The Man with The Plan" has worked his magic on a couple of pairs of my kicks. Never once, have I not cheesed like Chuck E. upon picking up my kicks. Once, I even noticed a small imperfection (Hey, a player of my stature has to pay attention to detail, you know?) and my man, Mario took the kicks back, reworked the entire job and I picked them up the next day free of charge for the additional work. You heard me right; there were no dead presidents diggin' the scene.  Main idea: This is the place to be if you get down in the Ahwatukee, Tempe, Chandler, or Mesa neck of the woods and you need a doctor for your kicks, luggage or leather goods...ask me again I'll still tell ya you should.  Can you dig it?
