worth going to.  i'm from nogales.  i'm so darn picky, but this place is great.  at least as good as it gets in phoenix for sure.  it's worth the drive when time permits.  i always order the quesadilla with carne asada and add guacamole and beans.  yum.  they have yummy horchata too.  honestly this place and america's taco shop are the only two places i really like in town.

I know there are dive places that people love and so if you're into funky/alternative, then yes- this is your place.  To me it's just dirty and the display shelves are not very welcoming.  but again- most people that come here are into this style.  very much the anti starbucks i guess.  it's open late so there you go. oh, it was a bummer that the credit card machine wasn't working and they were only take cash only.  huge inconvenience.

Oh wow.  Just reading the other four reviews.  My experience was AWESOME.  But here's probably why- my boyfriend went with me and he knew exactly how to deal with them.  You will need to agree to a price (a little bit of wheeling and dealing).  Got four tires and allignment for $450.  Mind you I have an Acura so they are going to be more expensive for a luxury car.  The wait was about 1.5 hours and luckily and this is the best thing- quite a few places around to kill time so you're not stuck inside a tire shop.  Got my car and everything is running well.  I will refer everyone I know.  But again- you got to be ready to negotiate.  So take a man with you! :) Or if you're a girl that knows how to do that more power to ya!

I wrote this the other day, but here's all I can say... I just went to Discount Tires and they were ten times more honest and helpful.  Just go to Discount Tires.  That's all you need to know. The one on Greenfield & Baseline is great.  ---- I've written both a good review and a bad review so I can tell you the 100% truth.    Shame on me for thinking I could write these jerks a good review.  So guess what? I've had my tires a little more than a year and only put 15K on them and they're totally SHOT.  When I called to see what I could do about getting prorated ones the man on the phone could not have been more rude.  In fact, I went to a separate Big O Tires store where they were immediately helpful.  Stand by for that review as I'm not totally knocking Big O just this store.  Turns out they gave me the wrong tires and that's why I had so many issues with fuel and my ride hasn't been very smooth.  The other Big O Tire locations says it looks like they just wanted to sell me what they had and my car specifically asks for another kind of tire.  Safety was not the issue, I was never in any danger, but really? You screwed up and you can't even help me so another store has to clean up after you????  DO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION!!!

I am so happy I go to this salon.  Mary Carmen German is the stylist to book with!  I have long, thick hair and color it bronde and she gets it perfect everytime.  She's awesome.  I am Hispanic and my hair can turn orange quickly,  but she knows how to keep this from happening.  Book her!   I once couldn't get in with her and had to see someone else which was a not the best decision, but the manager Olga was courteous and helpful and got everything taken care of.  I've been going here for a year and a half and will never leave Mary Carmen!  Like other reviews mention, it is my home now too.    http://www.stevenpaulsalon.com/Employees/Marycarmen_German/index.htm

I agree with Kristen E. when it comes to reviewing the ice cream.  It's ICE CREAM! And this place is ridiculously cute and nostalgic and a PERFECT date place.  I always sit at the counter, I feel like a kid or something.  As far as price, unless you're buying a pint at Bashas' you're spending this kind of money anywhere you go.  SOOOOOOOOO CUTE! love it.    I cannot speak for their food and this is not the primary reason to enter the doors at a place called SUGAR bowl :)

Nordstrom is simply the best department store.  Hands down.  I frequent Nordstrom's, Nordstrom's Rack and Nordstrom's Last Chance.  They just know how to do customer service and make you feel so good.  I actually just bought my wedding dress here! My bridesmaids bought their dresses at Nordstrom because I did NOT want matchy matchy and they also had a great experience.  They told me Nordstrom sold wedding gowns and so I thought I would try it out after about two dozen bridal boutiques.  I worked with a wonderful woman named Gaye who was simply a blessing.  Ask for her! You'll want to invite her to your wedding she's so great.  I finally said Yes to the dress! :)

How are there not more 5's!??!  Best pizza that has EVER EVER EVER touched my lips! Try pepperoni and ricotta as toppings and you won't regret it.  My boyfriend loves it now.  My last trip to NYC included a visit to the original in Brooklyn.  That was a lot of fun, but I'll say the version in PHX is even better!   People like to have rehearsal dinners or even weddings here.  Cute place.  Good first date.   GO.

only place to get your eye glasses.  you do have to get your exam somewhere else and bring your prescription.  i don't know why anyone would go anywhere else.

First I have to say I appreciate a mom & pop asian place that is not cheesey.  We get take out, but you want into the restaurant and think "wow, we really should have a date night here."  It's clean, modern, minimalist and I thank them for that.    Second, it's good.  Best pad thai in Phx if you ask me and I have had a lot of them.  My boyfriend also gets the pork sweet and sour and loves it.  The only issue we had is not having the option to get fried rice with his order, they said we'd have to order it for $8.95.  No biggie, but we opted not to order it.  Good prices.  Def must if you're in Tempe.

I really like what they've done to the place.  It looks a lot better.  There's always a good crowd in the bar.  Fun place for happy hour or dinner.  Just went on Saturday night and the Sous Chef was so great! He was bringing out Pad Thai Tacos to another table. I had to have them.  SOOOOO good.  Try them.  I guess they're on the "lounge menu." I also had the shrimp stuffed with lobster. I was in heaven.

Gotta review this place so that it NEVER EVER closes. I'm sitting here at 10:00 at night living in San Diego the last few years craving their orange chicken and crispy spinach. I think this place is great. Pricier than I'd like, but worth it! When I'm back in PHX I always have to grab takeout.

I don't understand why peeps like this.  I just think it's sooooooo weird.  i like the concept and i like that they give you tastings.  but overall, the food is meh AND it's kinda cold and lacks atmosphere.  but i guess it would be a haven for vegetarians and people who like soy.

Sometimes I think people are too hard on Olive & Ivy, the beauty of this place is how simple your meal can be (if that makes any sense)!   Although there are some $$$ items, there's also some fantastic reasonable dishes. Here's my idea of a wonderful Olive & Ivy dinner- a drink on the patio along the canal, then sit at a booth inside and enjoy truffle fries with the aioli dip PLUS the house focaccia bread with pesto to start. wow. Then I eat the chopped Mediterranean chicken salad to make myself feel better. The salad is AMAZING. Beautiful place, very romantic. It's probably my fav Fox restaurant. Other items on the menu are great too like the fish and risotto.   I think the service is great, although you can tell the server is bummed I'm not ordering more expensive stuff, but who cares!!?! Still a great experience.

Solid four.  I can't believe I lived across the street in college and never went.  Breakfast is yummy.  I'm a chicken strip connoisseur and Chompie's a terrific.

I could not agree MORE with Allison L. below.  I have NOTHING, but great experiences at the Dolce location in Chandler.  The same can NOT be said for Borgata in Scottsdale.    The receptionists unfortunately ruined the experience so I feel like I cannot review the actual professionals there.  I went in to take advantage of a spray tan package I purchased as I've been going to Dolce- Chandler for 5 years.  They claimed I had 3 fewer tans than I had purchased and I simply complained that every time I go- the receptionists seem confused by my tan package and that perhaps one or two were mistakenly taken from me.  This young lady threw a hissy fit, stormed away from me, practically did everything, but pout.  Naturally, I asked to speak to a manager.  I was kind of stunned to what had just happened!  The manager was calm, but it wasn't until I told her I would write about my experience on Yelp that I got any kind of apology.  Never underestimate the power of YELP!  She was kind and gave me an extra tan for my terrible experience which was good because I will continue to come here for other services, just NOT in Scottsdale.    This experience has motivated me to write a separate review about the lady who does my eyebrows at their Chandler location.  Tammy Higgins is AMAZING! Book her!

it's decent i guess.  i just had it.  regret going and feel yucky.  i never want to say anything bad about a mom and pop place.  all i can think about is that's their bread and butter.  but it's not good :(  and if you ever had mai island grill your absolutely going to be dissapointed.

No bells and whistles. It's not "hip" or "pretty."  You def feel like you're back in like 1975 working out with Rocky or something.  HOWEVER it gets the job done.  basic hours so doesn't fit crazy lifestyles.  And... super freaking cheap.  $75 for a whole year? Worth it.  The classes are solid.  Everyone is nice.  No one is there to see and be seen which is probably the best part.  You don't feel self conscience.  I could be considered high maitenance every now and then, but when it come sto a gym I'm good with this.  Location is very central too.  And if you love the SF Giants, then you're adjacent to their training facility.

A yummy lunch for $5? Heck yea! I've got to give My Big Fat Greek Restaurant props for their "order at the counter" version! They have a lunch special from 11-3 for a gyro plus salad or fries.  It may just be in the summer... I don't know, but it's a good deal.  Good size portion and healthy too! Can't beat that! Express restaurant gets an express five star rating.

Chipotle, Qdoba and Rubios are 10x better.  I felt it had no flavor.  Nice place, clean.  But the food was blah.  My steak was awful.  It looked ilke pork and am still not convinced that it was steak.  i regretted going there instead of jersey mike's next door  :(  sometimes you learn the hard way.

Great atmosphere.  Not pretencious.  Clean, homey and hip. Best of all- DELICIOUS.  This place is run by some major girl power.  I loved the watermelon, feta, cucumber salad.  Wow who knew that all went together.  I had the chicken they have this summer and it was just so flavorful.  The dessert is good, but not over the top (but some times I LOVE over the top).  Such a lovely dinner.  I will say I don't think it's for kids.

A solid four.  No need to worry it's anything less.  I'm impressed we have a place like this in the Val Vista Lakes area.  Clean, modern, clean, good service, clean, good pad thai and clean.  You always worry about that in a mom and pop.  Very good lunch special.  Spice scale is 1-10.  I got a 3 and it was just enough for me.  My sister got an 8 and was blown away and she likes spicey.  Just a heads up.

Excellent photographer.  Great to work with.  Adam is not going to be in your face.  He is welcome to you creative direction.  Easy going and SUPER affordable.  As I think it is with all photographer... expect to wait a while for your wedding photos.  That is not terribly out of the ordinary, but I did manage to get a few just to post on fb and frame!  What makes him a five star?  You can't beat the prices for that kind of work.  Great concept not to take a loan for some pictures! It's RIDICULOUS what some people charge.

What the new Dierks Bentley bar SHOULD be.  I was so happy to get here after trying out that whiskey bar.  This place is what you'd expect, complete with a red curtained stage.  The band when I went was AMAZING and I wouldn't say I'm the biggest fan of cover bands.  They played NEW country and it was great!  I'm telling all my friends to go!
