Started going here for bountiful baskets, but I started realizing I was getting produce I didn't want or need. Then Kodiak started putting out extra things you could buy. Now I am just shopping for the things I want . They do not have everything, but that's ok with me. They also have yummy whole grain  bread (in packs of 5, which you can freeze) and tortilla packs and usually a great price. I went last weekend with my mom and we walked out of there with produce for both of us and paid $6. Oh and they had those huge veggie trays for $1.50! Not sure they have them everytime but that is a HUGE savings over a supermarket price.

Pho makes me warm and cozy on the inside and makes my nose run on the outside. I love the authentic environment. Mmmmmmmmmmm.

This really is my favorite Mexican food around. Even though I'm mostly veggie, there's plenty of great choices. I love the green corn tamale, the black bean and rice burrito and at lunch they have a yummy black bean tostado with some kind of dressing that is like crack. And the salad with shrimp on it is excellent for the low carbers out there! Also the salsa is consistantly good. You must try their happy hour! Great Margs and Strong!!! Try the 3330 if you like um strong! If you sit in the bar, say Hi to Daniel! He's the best!

Oh Green, why did it take me so long to try you? I came here with a very picky vegan friend and we both left very satisfied. We had the hot wings, peanut tofu and the curry bowl with tofu and brown rice. Everthing was Yum! Everything was so tasty I didn't even reach for the siracha, and I do believe that is the best compliment I can give, because I LOVE siracha! I also had the lavender soda which was a great change of pace from other sodas out there. Green my only request is: Please come to CenPho!!!!

Thanks to FEZ for being my most dependable go to hang. I usually sit at the bar and have never had problems with the service. They serve my favorite hummus (GARLIC breath!) and the best (strong) bloody Mary's and I consider myself a connoisseur of both! Everything I've had here is de-lish. Go on Saturday or Sunday for cheap Marys!

I do love Shady's but i refuse to pay $14 for a martini in a CenPho bar, or anywhere for that matter. 4 stars for the Juke Box.

I've always loved AMC for the Movie watcher rewards and since this is closest to my house, I do have to say it's my favorite! Parking is a little tricky, but they do validate if you park in the arizona center parking garage. It took me a few attempts to self validate my ticket (you have to turn it upside down, duh!) but now I don't have to pay for parking I am a happy camper. Or just go on Sunday morning, ride my bike and it's $5 for any movie before 12! Yippie!

Went for Mother's day brunch. I wanted to like it, I really did. They had advertised a special the Mothers could eat for free. We'll get back to that later. We ordered their $2 bloody Marys. That is why I gave them 1 star. I ordered the lobster omlete. My son had the 2 egg special, Mom had Veg omlette and our friend ordered the pecan pancakes. You know it is taking a long time to get your food when you start joking "well, our waitress must be at the ocean, getting on her scuba gear to pick out the lobster...." It was Mother's Day, I did my best to be patient. Any way the food was meh...although I liked their lobster sauce, i thought the lobster was chewy. So we finish our meal and we get the check and only one meal had been credited for the Mother's free meal, but there were 2 Mother's at the table? So I tried to get a straight answer from the waitress....but she was trying to tell us each Mother only gets half their meal for free, huh? That's not what you advertised...lame. But who wants to argue on Mother's day? So I let it go and enjoyed the rest of my Mother's day. Except my son got very sick after and felt weak this morning. So sorry 1130, we won't be back.

I really expected to like Breadfruit having read the other reviews and being recommended as a veggie resturant. REALLY?!? There is one thing on the menu that is veggie? I'm perplexed and underwhelmed. Anyway, not too impressed with the flavors, I thought it would be spicier... And it took forever to get a glass of water, forever to get our beers opened, forever to get our food. But i wanted to give 2 stars for a locally owned business that takes buying local serious. But maybe give us some more veggie options?

You have to love Molly's Tamales for their sheer creativity! A vegan tamale, YES please! And they have so many yummy choices for us veggies! Where else can you find a spicy salmon tamale? If you love tamales, you gotta try this place! Start a new tradition for the holidays!

I have only been here once since I don't work nearby, but I live down the street.  I was really impressed with the creativity of the sandwiches and the nice people working here. Incredably fast service! I just recently heard they now have Saturday hours so I plan on stopping by after a bike ride.

You have no idea how long I have waited for this!!! How many times have I been to Da Vangs and ordered the #2A-no beef, add tofu? Countless, I tell you! Now it's strictly Boba juice for me! Everything is meatless! Yippie! The avocado boba rocks!!!! I could easily eat here everyday.

So, yes, it's a great location, 1 star. And a great interior, 1 star. After my 3rd visit I am officially ready to write them off my coffee list. I love supporting local businesses, but this place just isn't my cup o' jo.  Yesterday morning I went to get a latte, I ordered a small with an extra shot. The price went from $3 to $4.65, What the ....what?!? The esspresso just seemed to have a sour taste, and since I had to have my caffine, and wouldn't dare to go near the break room sludge, I forced myself to drink this. I actually wished I had gone to starbucks and I'm just not that kind of girl!!!! Maybe I am coffee spoiled, but I just couldn't palette this stuff. I am also sad they never have veggie options for breakfast burritos and they don't even carry carmel for a carmel latte?!? And the honey vanilla latte is too sweet for my taste. I am glad that some people like it, but I would rather be at Jobot or Lola's. And yes they do now except cards, but are not card friendly if you only order 1 drink.

Let me just say, my friends would tell you, I am a coffee snob.  I used to go to LUX way before they stuffed it full of furniture and became way too popular. (Hello, this is phoenix, can you offer some shade?) BUT now there is Lola Coffee and I can't remember the last time I went to LUX. The first time I went to this location I was instantly reminded of my favorite Portland coffee, stumptown. I love the fact that you can smell the coffee roasting as you get near. It just has a great vibe and has decorated in true minalmalist fashion (yes, lux, this is what it looks like) My favorite drink is the iced coffee, they put 2 shots of espresso in there, and I didn't even ask, Thank you! The pastries are always top notch as well. I am still in shock that someone said their coffee is no better than Starbucks. Have some respect, geesh!

I am very happy to have TMI down the street from me, so yes it is my local hang. I usually try to hit up the happy hour when I go. The owners are great and I have to say the servers have vastly improved since it's opening. The artichoke heaven is so good. But too rich for everyday consumption! Not a huge beer drinker, but I like their main ale and they get new beers on tap quite often. They do have mixed drinks here, but not a full bar. And please don't ask for red bull or ranch, it's just not that type of establishment ;-)

Boy did my dog stink! I've never been one to want to wrestle a wet dog. I needed a groomer and fast! Thanks to Yelp I found a groomer close enough to my house and set up a Saturday appointment. Molly my Rottie mix was done within 2 hours and she looked and smelled great! And it was $35 for everything, including nail trim! YAY! I will be going back fo sho!

Where do I start? Yes the parking garage. Are you FREAKING kidding me? Who planned this? I exit out on to the street with no visable signs how to get anywhere? Didn't you just build an outdoor mall? Shouldn't I be placed in a spot where I can actually spend money? Shouldn't this shopping center appear as if it's surrounded by an urban environment? Okay, so let's walk around the entire building or better yet, pass thru CVS and buy something so your parking can be validated. My first visit here was to bowl and although I am grateful to have a bowling alley in the 5th largest city in America, it just seems so suburban to me, in fact I think I prefer the suburban bowling alleys because they have a little (lot) more character. I am thrilled to have an Urban Outfitters downtown, which is why I gave CityScape 2 stars...and I have lived here long enough to know how great it is for Phoenix to invest in it's own downtown, but why did they go with this plan? It is as vanilla as any suburb and we deserve better!

Still so new, but I am giving 4 stars for the concept. I went to see The Red Chapel on opening night. Not as crowded as I thought, but that's okay. I am not trying to be negative, only relaying my experience. Upon entering I am greeted but not asked for my ticket. It's a kind of a "what do I do now?" feeling. So I want to order a glass of wine, but there is no wine list, so I ask for a Pinot noir. When I go to pay she says $16 and I was stunned, but then she proceeds to tell me the machine is down if it's not fixed soon we'll give you a free drink. Thinking that the drink may be free I decide not to push the I didn't see the wine list and I would not have ordered a $16-3oz. pour! Anyway, the lounge setting was very inviting and plan on coming back to hang out, even if there is no movie playing, there will be drinks served. So I enjoyed the documentary, liked the lighting in the theatre and the seating options, although there are no cup holders for drinks yet, there are tables for groups. However the theatre was a little cold and I was not prepared :-( So when the movie was over, I was told the card machine was fixed and given my $16 bill. It turns out she charged me $8 for the wine and $8 for a ticket. However I had purchased a ticket online, but no one had asked me. So she did put the credit back on my card. The staff is friendly and even eager, but the ticket taking issue may have to be worked out. I will be back as often as I can to support this local & cool business. Thanks for adding life to downtown!

I went to Nachobot last night and had the veggie option. Carmalized mushrooms, whole cloves of roasted garlic, cilantro, pico de gallo & 2 types of cheese! They come with chopsticks! This is a challenging proposition! We took our nachos next door to lost leaf and had them with a glass of zinfindal. This could easily become a habit!

When I pulled into the parking lot, l thought this new location would be packed inside, but there were plenty of machines, each with their own ipod charger & TV! Yay! Now its going to be easy to workout on the way home from work! So glad they replaced the old location!
