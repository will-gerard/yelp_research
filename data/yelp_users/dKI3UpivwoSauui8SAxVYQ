The food is awful! The people eating there were completely sketchy! I will never come back!

I'm pregnant, in my first trimester. On a Saturday afternoon I suddenly had severe tooth pain. I was limited on eating and I have way too many allergies to count, plus  dental work during pregnancy is not encouraged. I was so concerned and miserable.  On Monday I called McAdams Dental after reading all the reviews, to see if they could get me in same day. They did! Not only that, they got all my contact information for my obgyn was and scanned the instructions from my obgyn on what procedures were okay and not okay. Other dentists had told me this particular tooth had to be pulled as well as some others, so quite frankly I had not seen a dentist in a while because of this. He saved my tooth!! He was able to determine it was just cavity under my crown and not anything more serious. Not only that, he determined my other teeth also didn't need to be pulled! He did the work the same day, even sacrificing part of his lunch hour (not that he mentioned to me, I saw his schedule and noticed the time).  His wife who is a dental assistant there gave me two lead vests because I was concerned, and they use digital x-rays which cut the radiation by 93%. She got me a protein drink because I had not eaten much in the prior couple of days because of my tooth. They were so careful about my all my allergies and letting me know what they were using and that it was safer for baby and me. They honestly care.  These people are amazing, well priced, caring and attentive. I found a new dentist for me and my family, and I highly recommend them for everyone!

I went in for a first father's day gift for my husband, and wanted to get him something special. He's been wanting to get back into skating, and though our son is a baby, has talked non-stop about skating with him when he gets older.   Keep Screaming is around the corner from our house so I went there. I was concerned that I'd be walking into the cool kids lair and feel like an idiot, but while the place is cool, the "kids" are nice. The owner made me feel really comfortable, helped me with how much I should get the gift certificate for by estimating the board and accessories he would need, and didn't make fun of me when I used the completely wrong words for things. I went in with my husband and our baby to pick out my husband's fathers day skateboard and Josh, the owner, really helped him get an amazing board that was just perfect. He had fun skating again.  Highly recommend!!

Great service and the pizza is super good! Must try the vegan pizza and Mr. White (for those that are dairy inclined). Make your own pizza from their ingredients, cooked in 2 minutes in their 800 degree oven. We will return again and again, it's really that good!
