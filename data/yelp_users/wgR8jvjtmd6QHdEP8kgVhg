Not a bad place for lunch. It was reasonably priced, had good service and the food was pretty tasty. It's your standard Chinese fare with $7 lunch specials that come with soup, rice and an egg roll. We had the sesame chicken, sezchuan shrimp and dumplings in spicy broth. All these things were good EXCEPT for the stupid salad with ranch dressing that comes on the side.....while I appreciate the salad, I wouldn't really call an iceberg and ranch dressing salad "authentic" like the restaurant advertises.

Came for dinner and was very impressed. The food was excellent, the prices are fair, the service was good and portions were large.   I saw somebody had posted a picture of a little combo plate on Yelp. It wasn't on the menu but I showed the server the picture and he said he could make it happen. So I had the combo with manicotti and baked ziti with a meatball. Their sauce was excellent and the meatball was one of the best I've ever had.  We also started with small dinner salads....nothing special but fresh and good.  They don't take credit cards....so make sure you have cash ready.   It's a family place and everybody leaves with a handshake and pat on the back from the owner. It's a great atmosphere.   I would definitely come back here.

We really enjoyed our lunch here.   To start: chips with 2 kinds of salsa. One spicy with lots of Mexican oregano and one more mild one.   Then, we split the lunch portion of mushroom enchiladas, the pollo con queso and a chile relleno.   We enjoyed everything. It came out sizzling hot and very fresh. Everything tasted great and we will definitely be back.   My only complaint is that the food is a bit oily. The white sauce on the enchilada was starting to break and there was a small ring of oil around the plate.....same for the relleno .

Had the wor wonton soup and Mongolian beef.   Soup was great and filled with lots of good stuff.   Beef dish was good but much more typical American/chinese cuisine

Can't go wrong with this neighborhood pizza joint. The food is always good, fresh and cheap.   The chicken parm dinner is pretty awesome. For 10 bucks you get salad, Garlic bread, a huge portion of chicken parm and a side of spaghetti.

Pretty weak museum.   We went to the public library to get culture passes which allow 2 free entrances.  The museum really doesn't have anything to offer. There are a few interesting pictures on the wall and a few models of the challenger but really nothing else to see or do.   They have a few computers with Microsoft flight simulator so you can do some loops and rolls on the computer before you leave.   I wouldn't waste my time or money coming back here and I certainly wouldn't recommend this as a fun Phoenix activity.

This is by far the best Greek/middle eastern food I've found in the valley.   The shawarma comes in two sizes, and If you get the larger size (10 inch wrap), they use laffa/pita bread that they cook right behind the counter.   I really like the steak shawarma wrap meal which comes with a drink and your choice of fries, salad or rice. I get rid of the garlic sauce that it comes with and ad tahini instead. Awesome!!!

Not a good experience. Ordered at the counter and the guy who took my order was rude and not helpful. Then I waited 20 minutes for my food and was really disappointed with it. We had a carne asada burrito combo plate and an a la carte chile relleno. Everything was lacking flavor and I would highly recommend going somewhere else for fast Mexican food.

The course is in great condition and it's a great place to play a quick 9 holes.   12 dollars for the 9 holes.

First of all, the atmosphere here is amazing. The patio is quaint and quiet and a great spot for lunch (and they allow dogs). The service was phenomenal and perhaps most importantly the food was great! We got the sampler plate that came with hunter stew, peirogis, kielbasa and a cabbage roll. It was plenty of food for 2 people. The cabbage roll was the best thing on the plate and I would definitely get an order of the cabbage rolls as an entree next time we come here.

Came here hoping to find a super authentic "hole in the wall" type Mexican restaurant, but the entire meal was pretty underwhelming.   First, we were the only people in the restaurant and it took about 3 minutes of us standing around for anybody to realize we were even there.   We had a pastor taco.....which was very good.....  But we also got 2 combo plates and neither of them were very good. Everything was just luke-warm and bland. Really nothing special or good. Too bad....

This is my favorite Chinese place in the Phx area. It is a dumpy building and by no means fancy (in any way). But the food is amazing.....especially the house lo mein, beef chow fun and salt/pepper shrimp. Absolutely love this place.

The restaurant inside the market is amazing. The food is fresh, authentic, cheap and just awesome. We got 2 types of kababs, cheese pita, small meat pie, falafel, beef shawarma, and babaganouj. Everything we had was excellent and I am SURE that we'll be back very soon.

Got pad Thai and Panang curry   The pad Thai was weird tasting. Tasted more like a sweet and sour dish than a pad Thai.   The Panang curry was okay, certainly not what I would call Panang curry but not bad.   Overall overpriced. and not great. Wouldn't go back.

Really enjoyed breakfast here. The portions are huge.....but the quality of the food is quite good. We had the huevos rancheros with hash browns and the breakfast steak with pancakes.   The steak was cooked very well and really juicy. Whoever was working the grill knows what they are doing.   The huevos were also very good and we really liked the green chile. It wasn't very spicy but it had great flavor.   Pancakes were fluffy and tasty.   The service was fast and friendly and we will definitely be back.

Favorite Italian restaurant in the valley.   We have tried a bunch of things and are always satisfied. Among the best things we have had are the Cesar salad, chicken parm, pasta baronessa and chicken Marconi.   The service is good, the restaurant is small and not pretentious and the food is always great.

Came here for lunch.   Got the smothered carne asada burrito and the pork belly street tacos. Both were really good. The portions are generous, the food is cheap and the place was much cleaner than I expected it to be.   Would come back and try some of the other stuff.....the Tortas looked awesome (and huge).

Slowest Apple Store!!!  These guys take forever for anything and are horribly unorganized. Appointments often are an hour or more late and although I love apple products, I am NOT impressed with the "geniuses" that work here....I would highly recommend  going to a different Apple Store.

Surprised about how good this place was. Had the macho burrito which had carne asada, poblano chiles, refried beans and sour cream. It was awesome.......and the tortilla was really good too.   Also tried the cheese enchiladas and although they were pretty tasty, they were a bit too salty for my taste.   The little salsa bar was good and the green, tomatillo sauce was great. I will definitely be coming back.

We absolutely love this place. It's 7.50 per person for a double feature and they always have a great selection of movies that you would find at any other traditional movie theatre.   There is a concession stand with food, but we prefer to pack our own and have a little picnic in the car.   We have only gone on weekdays and the lots are pretty much empty.....maybe 3 or 4 other cars watching the same movie.   For unique and affordable entertainment.....this place rocks.

This place is one of my favorite places for happy hour. We almost always get the roasted garlic edamame and the chicken wings (I know...chicken wings at a sushi place seems wrong).   They have great drink specials and pretty much everything we've tried has been great.

We used to love this place but it's taken a nose dive in quality.   Came here for lunch and it was almost completely empty. The food quality has decreased drastically. The meat was dry and cold. The sides were cold. Everything was just weak.   The food was really just awful....after a dozen visits we'll probably never come back.

Came here for lunch and got the #1 combo which is a gyro pita wrap with fries and a drink. Also got the appetizer portion of babaganouj.   The pita was very good and the gyro meat was very flavorful. It was very simple and came with onions, tomato and tzaziki sauce.   The babaganouj was good but nothing out of the ordinary.

Quick and cheap but great food. Love the matchaca breakfast burrito, the carne asada burrito and the chile relleno plate.  I've come here several times and it is consistently good, and fresh. I would highly recommend it for a quick meal.

Came here for dinner and got:  Meatball sliders with mozzarella: these were very good. The only complaint that I had that it was pretty pricey for an appetizer with 3 meatballs ($12).....  Macaroni and cheese rustica pizza: this isn't on the menu but another yelper wrote about it and we had to try it.....and we weren't disappointed. It was awesome. It's a "personal" pizza but plenty for 2 and it is absolutely perfect.   The service was great, the atmosphere was great (there is a misted patio outside that's nice), and the food was excellent. We would definitely go back.....(although all the pizzas are shaped like penises and we don't know why....)

These guys are awesome. They take the time to educate themselves about all the products they carry and they spend time with you picking out what is exactly right for your needs. I bought a helmet from them and also the 2 pack of scala intercoms and they installed the scalas on both my helmets......huge help.   great place for all things motorcycle.

Came here for lunch and really enjoyed it.   We were in Hawaii a few weeks ago and kind of fell in love with what we think is the weirdest cuisine out there.....and Leo's nailed it. It's very authentic, fresh and cheap. It was great.   We had the bbq mix plate, chicken curry plate, and teriyaki masubis. All that food was $22 and we have plenty to take home.

This is probably the best Chinese place I've found in the metro Phoenix area.   Everything was obviously homemade and fresh and authentic.   We had the beef noodle soup, which was awesome, the pan fried pot stickers, soup dumplings, chive pancakes, and beef pies.   Our favorite thing was the beef pies but everything was awesome.   Seriously, we will be back REALLY soon because it was great.   Check this place out.

This place is great. We had the chicken and potato soup (on the house because ninos the owner is one of the nicest guys around), babaganouj, and three meat combo plate. Everything we had was tasty, homemade and fresh. The meats were seasoned well, the rice was great, the pita was hot and we were very very pleased with our dinner.   Thanks Ninos!!

Wish I had read the previous review. Unbelievable rip off.   The owner, Dan, showed up at my house to fix my dishwasher. The dispenser needed to be replaced and he told me that after a 65$ service call it would be an additional $223 to fix the dispenser. I asked him how much the part was costing and he told me he was charging me over $100 dollars for it. I then looked up the part online and saw that it was $40 bucks on amazon. You have got to be kidding me. What a joke!  I also asked him to look at another appliance while he was here and he told me he wouldn't unless he was paid more (Even though I had already paid him to come out)   Don't use this company. Find someone else to come help you out ORRR it may even be cheaper to just go buy a new dishwasher.   RIP OFF

Love this place. They have great breakfast sandwiches and good coffee.   It's cheap, fast, fresh and just good.   There are places to sit inside and outside but it does get very crowded inside (especially on the weekends).   Their bacon is strangely good......and my favorite thing to get is the bacon egg and cheese ADD cream cheese.

So impressed. We Were in the process of buying a used car in a neighborhood close to this shop and saw that it had good yelp reviews so we decided to bring the car here to do a prebuy inspection. Everybody here was friendly, they fit us in right away and didn't charge us anything for doing the inspection.....other shops in the area were charging 50-100 dollars to do the same thing.

Came here for breakfast and was really disappointed with the food quality. The restaurant is very clean, the service was good....but the food was just weak. We got the breakfast burrito (with corned beef hash) and it was just okay. We also got eggs Benedict which was fine but nothing special.   Food is kind of overpriced and we probably won't be coming back.

Really liked this place a lot. The food was fresh and delicious and the prices are very reasonable.   The pho was great. Well seasoned broth. Lots of noodles.   The combo fried rice plate was awesome. We added a little hoisin and chile sauce to kick it up a notch, but it had a really great flavor and we liked all the meats that were in it.   The Saigon crepe (#6) was an awesome appetizer. It is filled with pork, shrimp and sprouts....and comes with s great little dipping sauce.   We will definitely be back.

This place was really good. The best part of the meal was the garlic knots. They were cooked perfectly, and seasoned with a TON of garlic....I also really like the marinara sauce that they were served with.   The pizza was good, although the dough was a little bit thicker than I would have liked....but still delicious. I got the margarita pizza and added meatballs to it.....pretty great meal.

Amazing restaurant.   Came for happy hour and had the perfect little meal. We had the famous chopped salad, the smoked chicken wings, and the Brussel sprouts over polenta. Everything was fantastic.   The food was unique and delicious. The cocktails were refreshing.The service was impeccable. The prices were fair and the portions were generous.   This place just nailed it.

Came here for a late lunch and was pretty disappointed. Got a salmon roll, spicy scallop nigiri and a freshwater eel roll.   The fresh water eel roll was NOT good and tasted rotten so we spoke up and said it was bad.....but the sushi chef (who seemed to be the owner) just argued and said it was good and fresh and there was nothing wrong with it. It was very uncomfortable and although he did take it off our bill, we shouldn't have been made to feel bad about not liking rotten sushi.    The other two things we got were fine. Nothing special.....but not bad either.   We were the only ones in the place and we most likely won't be coming back. There are several MUCH better places in the area.

Good food. Good prices. Good service.   The lunch bowl-o-pasta is 5.99 and an all you can eat pasta bowl. It's really tasty and for a few extra dollars you can get awesome meatballs or sausage....or one of each.   We also really like the Pablo Picasso salad. The salads are absolutely enormous (they call their small size "big") and can easily be an appetizer for 4 people.   Overall this place is just quick, easy, affordable and consistently delicious.

Had the huevos benidictos, eggs Benedict and Dutch Apple French toast. None of the food was bad but it wasn't great either. They used frozen store bought potatoes for the country potatoes and pre-made frozen hash browns. The apples over the French toast tasted like they came out of a can and didn't have much flavor.   The restaurant is clean and the service is good which is why I went 3 stars instead of 2.

The Yelp reviews do not lie.   This place was awesome.   We came for lunch and got 2 meat platters so We could try each smoked meat offering. One one plate we had grits and potato salad, and on the other we had beans and Coleslaw. The grits were by far our favorite side.....  But now the important part: the meat. Ranked in order of our favorites: 1. The ribs. They were amazing. It was a meat based religious experience.  2. The fatty brisket. Kinda made me want to weep.  3. The sausage  4. Pulled pork 5. Turkey.   While I thought the pulled pork and turkey were VERY good....I could live without it. But honestly....I don't think I can wait more than a week before I go back for ribs and brisket.   To finish, we split a pecan pie. Plenty big enough for 2 people and really delicious.   We got there around 1:45 on a Thursday and there was no line BUT we did score the LAST piece of fatty brisket.....  The ONLY downside I can think of is that it's a bit pricey. Not unreasonable....but 2 plates and a pie was just under $50.

Came in for a broken vacuum that was 3 years old. They fixed it in 15 minutes, cleaned the rollers and put on a replacement part that my vacuum was missing.......and they didn't charge for any of this.   They don't take appointments, you just bring your vacuum into them and their goal is to get you out the door with a perfect vacuum as quickly as possible.   Go dyson!!!

If you're looking for a mattress at a reasonable price, do yourself a favor and check this place out. After spending about two hours driving from store to store at the furniture and mattress stores on bell road I found that what I was looking for was around the $500-$600 mark. Not wanting to spend that much I started driving home.....but then I saw sign for a sale at mattress 360 and I decided I would make one last ditch effort to get the mattress I was looking for at a reasonable price. I walked in, got great and friendly service, found exactly what I was looking for....and it was only $118. A comparable mattress was going for $600 at mattress firm.   Couldn't be happier.

So impressed. Came for lunch and will be back soon. The food was awesome.   Got the enchilada style burrito with shredded chicken, hot sauce and pinto beans and it was delicious. (Added sour cream)  Also hat he Saturday Special which was 2 shrimp tacos with rice and beans and a drink for around $9. We got one of each type of shrimp (coconut and Caribbean) and both were really good.   The real selling point for me is the fresh made tortillas that are hot and chewy and really what I want at any good Mexican restaurant.   We also really liked their sauces (the enchilada sauce and the cilantro ranch)   Last good thing to say is the drink fountains....in addition to normal coke products they have awesome horchada, mint lemonade, strawberry lemonade and limeade.

Not sure what the hype is about. We came here because we saw all the great reviews and thought the wings were just fine.   On the positive side, the wings are cooked very well. They are crunchy and have a great crispy exterior and juicy inside. Everything else though was standard at best.  We had 6 original buffalo and 6 twc dry rub wings. They were fine. Nothing special. Nothing bad. Just normal wings that you could get anywhere.  As a foodie it pains me to say that a chain is better than a small business like this one....but honestly....I would rather go to Buffalo Wild Wings.....

Hands down the best street tacos that I've ever had.   We got pretty much everything on the menu: Steak and egg breakfast taco Carne asada taco Chicken taco Steak burrito  Carne asada quesadilla.....  They are all amazing. The meats are seasoned perfectly, the toppings and cheese are great and their salsas are delicious.   Recommend this place!!!!!
