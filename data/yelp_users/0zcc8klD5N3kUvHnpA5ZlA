I went here after seeing all the good reviews. It lives up to expetations. Kung pao chicken and mongolian beef were delicious. The staff was out quick and served quick. I'll certainly be back.

Below average Chinese food. Chow mein was very greasy., sweet and sour pork was honestly just yucky. Their Mongolian beef was decent, but it's 5% beef with the rest being greens.  Only been here once and not going back.

I'm a sucker for alcohol and the drinks here are great. Marrrrrrgaritas! Food was as expected from the most rated place I've been to. Expect to be elbow to elbow on a packed night. No complaints here but if that's not your thing.

Found my new favorite place for sesame seed chicken! Yummy. The staff speaks very clear English too and doesn't confuse my very accent-challenged self which makes me less self-conscious and, in the end, awards you more Yelp stars! Or something. The fried rice/chowmein is good as well, typically in my experience the noodles and rice are 90% grease but they seem to realize how the human body processes such things and have decided not to try to murder us slowly. Cool!
