So far so good. Only been here one time and I got the chicken bowl. Was hot and fresh. I would return here again to try some more things. Service was friendly and my to go order came out pretty quick.  Oh and their chocolate chip cookies were delicious!

0 stars for the crap oil change job and 1 star for the low quality carwash.   NEVER go here to get your oil changed. 1 week later I was back after paying $150 for the oil change and air filter change with leaking oil. Not just a few leaky drops out of my car but I am talking puddles of oil all over my driveway and oil trails when I drove anywhere. I give my car to him after 10 interrogating questions about what happened and wait. The guy comes back and proceeds to tell me I had a faulty seal (on a 2011 car) but they fixed it at no charge and gave me a brand new oil change. Plus another crap carwash all for free. Thanks, I appreciate it as I wasted more time for your mistake. Never go here. Jiffy Lube does a better job and for way cheaper. Wow.

Hotel staff is very nice and professional. Grounds are absolutely relaxing and beautiful. Must do a Sunday Brunch here and a pool day!

Thank you to the staff and Dr. Matchette for the wonderful vet service I received today. My 3 dogs ingested a large bar of chocolate this morning so I called Kaibab and they were able to see me immediately.  Dr. Matchette took great care in examining my dogs and explaining what she was doing. Luckily, my pups are OK and Dr Machette let me know what to watch for in the next 24 hours in case of any changes in my dogs behavior.  I appreciated the quick appointment time and friendly and helpful staff!

This place would get 5 stars everytime if they would just add more wait staff. Been in here multiple times and every waitress has too many tables so it takes a while to get service but when they do come around they are friendly and apologetic about the long wait. Food is phenomenal every time but management, please get more staff on each shift!

Oh My Dog is one of the best dog boutiques I have been to.  Jackie is the best!  She is so helpful and genuinely cares about your dog! I have quite a few products (clothes, collars, harness, treats, dog bowls, toys etc) that I have bought from here and each one has been the quality of product Jackie told me I would be getting.  I have had my 2 chihuahuas' nails clipped at the grooming department and never had an issue. I also had 2 doggy teeth cleanings done and had a good experience with that (despite what my dogs think!).  Although the price of a lot of items is high, each item has been higher, lasting quality.  This boutique is a monthly stop on my route for my doggy products!

Delicious food! Their burgers are always amazingly fresh and tasty.  Normally I always have great customer service, but this last time the server seemed too busy doing her closing duties as opposed to bringing our food out on time.  It was a bit on the cold side...disappointing, but still good! Would give it a 5 star, but this last time really bummed me out.  Hopefully next time I get warmer food!

Great instructors and an amazing workout everytime. I hate to tell people I work out here because I don't want the classes to get super busy! Would recommend this studio 100%!!

Delicious food but long wait to get a table (I was here on a Saturday for brunch, of course) When we did sit, food came fast and service was good! Must have the pancakes!

Great yoga classes and most of the instructors are phenomenal!! I especially love Anton and Alex's classes. They really push you and get your heart pumping. I love Anton's spiritual side of yoga as well.  I always leave MIC feeling more zen and on a yoga high! It also helps that I'm profusely sweating and feel like I just did an hour of cardio!  I haven't been to any of the spin classes but everyone I know that goes to MIC raves about those as well.   The only cons I would say is the parking is bad and it's tough to get a close spot usually. And I do wish they would make a "No Talking" or "Only Quiet Voices" inside the yoga studio since mostly before class you're trying to get in the meditative vibe and there's chit chat until class starts. Love pretty much everything about MIC and wish they would open one in Scottsdale!!

Sad to say but I won't be returning here until they step it back up. I've been a long time loyal customer at Chop Shop and everytime I go the last couple of months, the quality is bad. Before Chop Shop grew in size, they had healthy food, good sized portions and the food was fresh. Today, I had a warm Kale Caeser salad with mixed greens, iceberg lettuce and about 5 pieces of kale. The whole salad is supposed to be KALE with some mixed greens. What happened here?  I can tell they're faster at the orders because normally I have to wait 20 mins and today I only waited about 7-8, but that comes with a price. The price is an $11 salad with warm dressing and unhealthy iceberg lettuce I could buy at the store for $2.   Chop Shop - I won't be returning until you go back to your roots and give me back my healthy salads like you originally started with.

Tried this place today for lunch for something different.  The wait is long around lunch time but the staff is pretty efficient and very nice!  Prices were about what you would expect from a place that is higher quality than a Subway.  I had a turkey sandwich and a cup of soup.  Both were fresh and tasted good.  Would make this a regular stop for my lunch.

LOVE this place. I literally crave their cheeseburgers all the time.  Staff is friendly and knowledgable on their many selections of beers. Lots of TV's all over with a giant patio that I havent yet had the pleasure to sit on because it is too hot.  Definitely try this place out!

Love this place and come here often. Fresh juices with a large variety of made that day juices or pressed right there when you order it.  Prices are reasonable for pressed juice as everywhere is expensive and this place isn't any more or less expensive than the other pressed juice shops. Haven't tried any of their bowls but pressed juices & smoothies are delicious.
