Love this place. Great food and service. You need to try a Salt River Bar if you stop in. They are killer

The family and I stopped in on Thursday night to check it out. My wife and I both had the glendale burger if i recall. We also had fries and onion rings. Everything was great. I see a few reviews on here mention soggy fries and where's the beef. I disagree. Our fries were crisp and the onion rings were perfect. The beef was great and tasted awesome. Could have been working out the kinks and that is why they had a bad experience. In my opinion it was very good. So good i took a buddy there for lunch the next day. Word of advice. Pick up some ranch. They got a secret recipe thing going on and a great addition to the fries and onion rings. We needed a place like this and stoke to have them here.

Great looking menu but horrible service. I ordered a standard meal that came with 3 eggs, toast, bacon and 1 pineapple upsidedown pancake. Eggs were not even close to cooked right. The signature pancake was just ok. But I am getting off track. The service or lack there of was worse than going to a Denny's drunk at 4am. We had to continually remind our waitress about everything. You want water? Better give her another reminder. You ask for jelly for your kids toast? Better reminder her AND she doesn't give you an option on flavors. She just walks away and brings a random jelly in a ramekin. Btw they do have options she was just to busy,doing nothing at all, to provide them to my daughter. Order coffee and cream? Had to remind her twice about the cream.   Ask about ingredients due to an allergy? Good luck they just told us not to order it because they don't know. Thanks guys! Allergies aren't always something that just give you the sniffles. My daughter is DEATHLY allergic to certain things and this day and age a lot of people are. You need to treat allergies seriously. It will also go a long way in terms of service.  My last complaint and I will stop. I ordered an iced coffee which came in a pint glass. The glass was mostly ice. So after getting my creamer and drinking my mini ice coffee down I order refill. Waitress gets it and this is where I had to remind her about creamer AGAIN!!! Any way I get our bill and they are charging me for two at $3.50 per. At this point I am stunned so I ask the manager why I am being charged for two since regular coffee has free refills. His response is because ice coffee comes from a keg. I could go on and on about his response, the way he came across and the fact that they are just taking brewed coffee, putting it in a keg, chilling it, pouring it back into a glass which is mostly ice, charging a premium and not offering a refill. I will just say that the manager was snarky and rude about it. Btw the waitress probably should have given a heads up too..  It is sad when your 5 & 9 year old pick up on how bad the service is....  No thanks snooze. You Snoozed and you lost my business. Not coming back and going to Coffee Rush for my iced coffee. Which btw taste better and didn't come from a keg.
