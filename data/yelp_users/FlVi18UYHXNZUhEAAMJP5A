When I think of a solid family neighborhood Chinese restaurant, this is what I think of.  Dragon Bowl was that for me when I lived in the area and I and my family have eaten there over a dozen times.  Great portions, great price, and delicious food.  The staff is always nice and pleasant to me and they use the polyfoam crates instead of paper which helps against leaks.  I recommend checking them out!

Note:  I mostly fly Southwest.  Lines move pretty fast, the people are very friendly, and if you're running late, you can usually get someone to help you catch your plane.  They don't operate like robots and really understand your needs.  As far as the airport goes, there are great restaurants and if you were ever stuck here, it is a great place to be stranded!

I've been to this location a few times and it has always been a pleasure.  Just FYI, I never go through the drive thru (in any place I go pretty much) so this is just my experience from waiting inside.  Maybe I've been lucky, but my food is always hot and fresh.  The workers have always been very nice and make you want to come back.  It isn't the newest interior, but not the oldest either.

Talk about a great neighborhood bakery/restaurant.  Half this review is based off of my Dad who is a regular there now.  He is treated great there and they have a nice family and old school get to know your proprietor atmosphere.  I can say their service is great, they give you great deals, their baked goods are some of the best in all of Arizona, and the sandwiches I've had there are awesome as well.  I don't have anything bad to say about this place.

When it comes to grocery stores, I tend to prefer Fry's over Safeway, Albertsons, and the like.  But this Fry's Signature store is AMAZING.  Anything you want, they seem to have it.  Health food, ice cream, flowers, USPS, Kosher, Spanish, Live Sushi Bar, Wine Bar with TVs, Lounge with TVs and couches... I could go on, but you get the idea.  Normally a place with this much stuff, that is this nice and in Scottsdale... well you would think the food would be pricey.  But nope.  The deals are abundant (especially with a free Frys Foods membership) and I find better deals at Frys than you can at the cheapest of places.  There are always plenty of counters open, for regular and few items, the cashiers are always nice and same with the baggers.  Oh yeah, they have those, which is something most places have done away with, but here, you still get that feeling of what grocery shopping used to be like.  I've even seen them offer, and carry groceries to people's cars who need assistance.  I can't recommend a grocery store enough.

Tucked away in a corridor next to Chompies, Sushi Ko is a solid Asian restaurant.  They are small, and their menu more extensive than you would think for a small place, but every time has been a pleasure.  I haven't been during busy hours, so I cannot comment on long waits, as I have had none.  They do close a bit early for an establishment that I would think would be open later given the crowd they would attract.  Everyone has always been friendly though, and the food delicious.

Good, fast, friendly service.  The food was hot and fresh and the store was very clean.  I'd stop by here again on my long drives to Vegas.

They spent their time with me picking out the perfect colors to go with the pictures I wanted matted and framed.  No pressure, no rush, and they came out amazing!  Reasonable pricing too.  I'd highly recommend this store to anyone who needed something custom framed.  The nicest people too!

Officially my new favorite pizza place and go to for all things delicious.  Gotta love that thick Chicago style pizza.  Wings were mediocre, but the pizza makes up for it.  Meatball grinder also very good.  Restaurant never seems full but there's always a massive line for takeout.  I'm always one of them and will continue to be!

I went in looking to trade in a car and walked out (well it was the next day actually, they delivered the car) with a brand new Kia.  First, I must say I never thought I'd get a Kia.  I remember when they first came to the USA and their Kia Sephia was the laughing stock of the automobile world along with the Geo Prizm.  Those days are over, and I knew that so I figured I'd check them out.  They also had some great deals at the time as well being nationally advertised.  The negotiation went smoothly, the initial salesman was very nice and helpful, and the manager who I finished negotiating with was also very professional.  They didn't have the color I wanted available in the body style I wanted, but did a dealer swap in order to get it to me the very next day (delivered to my house).  For service I bring it to Mark Mitsubishi (who were also nice and professional) as that is closer to my home and work.    Maybe it was because of the sales, but I had never seen a car dealership that busy in my entire life.  It was crowded due to the rebuilding after the fire, but they kept it comfortable for the guests.  Only 3800 miles on it so far, but the car has been great!

I guess I can only speak for myself but I've had the vast majority of my experiences with them be great.  They know how to work on a nice car.  They do sell hard, but it doesn't bother me and I can always say no, which I do.  When I do want a wax, buff, etc, I ask them, and I get it bundled with all my cars and get a pretty good deal compared to other places.  They made my Mercedes look brand new after the paint was fading!  Nice people.

I am actually very surprised at all the poor reviews for this place.  I have been a half dozen times if not more and it's always been great.  Their eggs are great (important for an establishment with their title) and I do have a thing for their toast as well.  It is always busy when I arrive (late breakfast time), but the waits aren't usually too long and the staff is always very friendly.  It has a nice atmosphere as well, and seems very family oriented.  I know I will keep coming back for their scrambled eggs!

Good food, nice upscale family atmosphere, and great service.  A bit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for here.  Haven't had a bad meal yet and whether it's dining in or taking out, it has always been satisfactory.  Everyone who I've been there with has liked it as well and keeps going back.  I'll be there again!

My favorite restaurant in the valley!  Always great food, great service, and great location!  Can't beat the atmosphere.  I've only been here for dinner but it's been amazing every time and the waitstaff/chefs are willing and ready to do anything we ask with the food.  Best tasting salmon and beet dinner ever!

Their menu is HUGEEEEEE.  You can go here every week and get something different.  Fun atmosphere.  You can do sports fans, business, families... it all seems to work.  Great service too.  I will be back!

Scott Hewitt is the man.  Amazing guy, honest, knows what he's doing, and knows good business.  Brought my car here after I got rear ended, drove across the country after a "fix" but a Liberty Mutual repair shop in CT, but Scott is the one who actually finished fixing the car.  For any repairs, I'm going to him.    The reason this isn't 5 stars is because of the glass side.  I used the glass repair when my windshield got smashed by a rock.  Come to find out, they put the wrong windshield on.  You can see the residue they left on top of my car from the unnecessary glue that was used to force the wrong size windshield to fit.  I know this only because I used safelite the second time my windshield got smashed by a rock (curse you I-17 around happy valley) and they confirmed this, and then installed the correct windshield.  My car may not be the most popular, but if you're doing glass, you should know this.    Luckily, Scott and his level of service allow me to give 4 stars.

Great pizza, nice people, and overall good food.  The place is small, and they seem to be busy a lot so the wait times aren't great, but whenever I'm in the area, I always check them out.  I think it's their sauce, but their pizza does have a distinct flavor, which is good.  It can get a little loud in there, but I like the authentic Italian feel that it gives.

I've eaten at Outback Steakhouses before, but for some reason this time the service was a little sub-par and the food just wasn't that great.  My fish was lacking in taste, and my friend's chicken was terrible.  I know they can do better and maybe we were just unlucky.  Regardless, I won't be hitting up this location again.

Brand new fresh updated rooms (remodeled just this year) along with great staff, free hourly shuttle trips to the strip along with having the usual Residence Inn perks of a great breakfast, store, and even some events made this a 5 star for me.  Probably the best staff at a Residence Inn or any Marriott I have stayed at.  They just need to take pictures of their new rooms and put them online for everyone to see!

Great seafood!  The fish is amazing.  The best I've had in Arizona and... a lot of places really.  I'd go back sooner but the location, while right off the highway, isn't ideal as far as a neighborhood goes, so I do not find myself in that location often.  If someone said they wanted great seafood though, this is where I'd send them.

I want to start off by saying I have eaten at many California Pizza locations, but for some reason this one was wildly different than others.  The sauce was oily and runny, the crust was overcooked, and it seemed almost too thin.  The toppings didn't seem fresh either.  I can't imagine all their pizza is like this but I won't be heading back to this location again.

A solid location for this chain.  Great food, great wait staff, and great atmosphere.  I sat outside and you have the baseball game on TV looking one way, and the beautiful Town Square center looking the other.  A great place to enjoy yourself and relax, especially with nice weather.  The Town Square location is exceptional and reminds you more of Scottsdale than the normal barren wasteland of Vegas.  This just adds some freshness to this Yard House location.  Update: I've been back since and the service was still great.  Got to watch Kobe's final game and the place was locked in on the TVs.  Great atmosphere.

This would have been a 2 star rating based on the quality of food and the service.  But I had to drop it down to a 1 given the price.  $37 for sauteed chicken and vegetable fried rice?  Get out of here.  Especially when you expect things to be GOOD at a Casino of this caliber.  The food, the chicken... tasted like soggy water.  The vegetables were bland, as if all the flavor was cooked out of them.  Probably the worst Chinese food I've ever had.  If you're in the mood for some Chinese food... find another place, or get some different food, or better yet, save your money and buy a Snickers bar or something at a gas station because you'd be much better off than spending your money at this place.

Checking in and checking out was as easy as it can be.  I do like the 50's vibe, and the rooms have been recently redone, but unfortunately it seems like there is still some wear on everything.  There was a bug in my friend's room and the ceiling in my room had a water stain, indicating something wrong with the plumbing.  Staff was friendly and didn't spend much time in the casino so I can't comment on that, but it looks like it could use a little work.  As a Hilton Honors member, I know Hilton can do better.  However, it was very affordable so I can't knock it for that.

I usually arrive for a late breakfast, and this place always has a line out the door.  They can't all be wrong, right?  They're not.  The food is great, the service is good, and they do a great job communicating with each other when things are at their busiest.  I remember running into their owner when they opened their new location (Chandler I think it was?) and if I remember right (Brothers own the stores?).  Either way, I have been to multiple locations of theirs, and it is a pleasure every time.  This one however, is my favorite, although I wish it was bigger so the line wasn't as long.  Family friendly and despite how busy it is, you never feel rushed.  Not a fan of the way they do rye toast, but am a fan of the eggs.

This store and company know how to do good business.  I've been here a bunch of times and always enjoyed my stay, but I never had an issue I needed help with nor did I come away with one.  However this past week ATT and their insurance company basically screwed me over.  I couldn't get anywhere satisfactory with ATT and the insurance company gave us 5 different answers from 5 different people with no real solution.  So I contacted the Microsoft store to see what they could do.  I spoke with 3 different managers over 2 days, and boy, did they ever come through.  I will always go back to them for help.  After telling them the lengthy story about what happened, they said, don't you worry, we're going to take care of you, and we'll make sure you have the product you wanted and were supposed to have.    They did just that, all 3 managers communicated to each other so they all knew what was to happen to solve my problem, and they did just that.  I guess after talking to big corporations who normally bully customers with the "my way or the highway" attitude, I got used to that being the case.  The Microsoft store, second richest company on EARTH, treated me like a friend and family, and most of all, a human being who's problem they could solve by conducting honest, intelligent business, while keeping a customer for life.  I was surprised to see the flexibility allowed by such a big corporation and the  managers working there really do have the power to make their own business decisions.  I did not go in there expecting them to be able to help much, but they certainly blew me away with old school mom and pop store type business attitudes.  Kudos to the helpful employees there and they have a customer and fan for life!

When it comes to grocery stores, I tend to prefer Fry's over Safeway, Albertsons, and the like.  This Fry's store doesn't have as much as a Signature store (literally smaller), but has the same quality feel.  For any regular and still some special items, this store probably has you covered.  Once again, the prices are low.  The deals are abundant (especially with a free Frys Foods membership) and I find better deals at Frys than you can at the cheapest of places.  There are normally plenty of counters open, and the cashiers are always nice and same with the baggers.  I've seen the baggers offer, and carry groceries to people's cars who need assistance.  I definitely recommend it.

Greg is the man.  XJR owner here.  Heard some funny noises coming from the front.  Thought it was the engine.  Turns out it was nothing bad at all, and it took Greg all of 3 seconds driving it to figure it out.  He is the Jaguar whisperer.  My car has never been running smoother and he's taught me a lot.  Even know his Jaguar racing history.  Honest, good prices, and will tell you how it is.  Helped me with a wheel issue I was having and got the wheel and tire shop to fix everything for free for me with his backing.  I'll never go to anyone else.

This restaurant is located within the Tropicana, and definitely is the best part of that venue.  The food was fantastic, and the pasta dish I ordered really hit the spot.  The staff was very polite and helpful, and even joked with us.  I would actually make an effort to visit this place again if I didn't stay at the Trop knowing that I'd receive a good meal.

This was possibly the best burger I've ever had.  At least tied with the best.  I went simple with my burger because I wanted to taste the actual meat.  Great choice!  The fries were also awesome.  Slightly messy but such is expected.  Great atmosphere and polite waitstaff.

The Acura dealer wanted to charge a lot of money for what seemed like a simple repair and I knew that couldn't be right.  D&W fixed it for just a fraction of that amount, and not only that, looked the car over before a long trip and helped out just for being a customer.  Anytime the Acura needs anything, D & W will get my business!

I took an entire group of clients to this location and everyone had a great experience and enjoyed their meal.  They certainly don't cheat you.  Double patties, a ton of fries overflowing and filling up the bag, and a quality meal.  The service was quick for lunchtime considering all the orders, and the staff was friendly.

Like all Navy Federals, this one treats you with respect.  Never had a bad experience and do lots of business with them.  I'm not sure what that one commenter below said about fees etc.  I've never paid any fees at all with Navy Federal as they have the fewest fees and most free things out of any bank/credit union out there.  Free checking, savings, atm... best rates on other financial products... so definitely don't want to misinform out there.  It doesn't get much better than Navy Federal as far as handling your day to day money goes.  What makes me come back every time are the great people that work there and that are always willing to help fix a problem and make things right if there is any confusion.

I don't normally give 1 star reviews unless the customer service experience was horrible, which was not the case here.  The wait staff was mediocre, nothing special, nothing bad though.  I did however get a bad case of food poisoning though from my meal, which had their salmon in it.  I did not finish the meal entirely, and the food was also mediocre (3 star food at best), but the food poisoning did it for me.  C'mon guys, make sure that kitchen is clean and the food is cooked!

Very nice Asian restaurant and sushi place.  Good sushi and good menu items as well.  They have everything that you would expect and a bit more.  The quality is great, and everyone at the table liked their dishes.  I have been there a few times now, and will be back for more.  I have only gone during lunch, but the portions were perfect as well.

Dr. Andrea Watson gets 5 stars in my book.  I was on my way back to Phoenix (driving) and needed some adjusting for the long car ride.  Her husband actually saw me the other day before to help loosen my back (much needed).  She was on her way to lunch, but I mentioned I was literally heading back right then, and she set aside some time to take care of me.  My back gives most people problems, but she was able to handle it (some credit to the other Dr for helping the previous day) and I felt ready to go for the drive home.  Very nice and very helpful.

This place is great!  Originally heard about them on 92.3 KTAR and found out that one was near where I lived.  The Docs there are awesome and take the time to listen to you as they really want to help you to the best of their abilities.  I always feel better coming out of there than I did going in.  The staff of Christine and Llarrissa are very pleasant and helpful and always greet you with a smile!  If you have back or neck pain, and aren't going here, then you're crazy!  I highly recommend.

Like the others, don't normally leave a review for fast food, but the service is top notch, they'll greet you, are polite, don't skimp on toppings at all, and I even got a free cookie!  Great managerial staff there.  This place isn't by my work, but if I'm in the mood for a quick lunch, I'll drive to this location.

Great family place to go for breakfast.  I used this restaurant to help me gain my appetite back from my food poisoning affair from earlier in the week at a different restaurant.  The wait staff was exceptionally good, great service all around.  Complimentary muffin for new customers as well, so check it out if you haven't been yet!  The eggs were good, though nothing amazing, but the fresh fruit was delicious as was the toast.  They don't cheat you on a hearty breakfast!

Lowery's Garage is my new go to place for all my GM vehicles.  Certified Master Tech GM mechanics who were able to fix every issue with my Buick with ease.  They've either seen it before, or know how to find the answer and figure it out.  My car now runs smoother and quieter than when I bought it.  Honest mechanics that charge a fair price, I'd recommend you choosing these guys to be your local mechanic.
