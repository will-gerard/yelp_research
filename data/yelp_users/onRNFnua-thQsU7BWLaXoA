Fast and friendly service, reasonable prices and the french toast was big, fluffy and delicious. If you don't beat the morning rush expect to have to wait a while. On the plus side they do offer complimentary coffee while you wait.   How busy it gets is definitely a testament to the quality of the restaurant.

This is another case of a restaurant that opened too soon.  My co-workers and I decided to give it a shot for lunch yesterday.  It has only been open about 5 days at this point but when you are opening a new restaurant, soft launches are foolish and only serve to drive away customers from coming back.   We were informed when we were seated that they wouldn't have ground beef for another 30 minutes.  Well, that ruled out the hamburgers and meatloaf leaving only a handful of items like $14 chicken plate, one of the few breakfast items, a few salads and a few appetizers.  We were woefully unimpressed with the selection and were told that they would be adding more menu items soon.    The prices in general seemed higher than I would like to see from a diner.  We're willing to give it another try but don't want to waste our time until the menu is more than a single sheet.  Can't imagine how Dave N. has been here "several times".  Have you sampled everything on the menu twice, Dave?  Collin R.'s review also feels fake and like he hasn't actually been here.

I ordered a bouquet of chocolate-dipped fruit for my wife for Valentine's Day online and opted to deliver it myself.  The website was easy to use and the prices were about on par with what I would have paid for any of the other more traditional gifts.    I was in and out of their location in about 5 minutes.  The fruit smelled great and the presentation was very nicely done (the package I ordered came with a balloon and teddy bear) and easy to carry.  It made a great impression when I delivered it to my wife at her work.    She had some leftovers that made it home to me so I can attest to the fact that the fruit was fresh and delicious, even 2 days later (keeping it refrigerated of course).  Definitely a creative gift idea for any holiday that I would use again!
