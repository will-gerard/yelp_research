This is the worst Starbucks on this end of town. The employees are always rude (except for Ricky). They usually don't chitchat, or even say hi. On my last visit, I don't think anyone even made eye contact. There's often a long line in the morning.   If I were you, I'd just drive to the Starbucks at 99th & Lower Buckeye.

I went after work; around 6:20pm and got right in. They were closing at 7p so I had a pedicure and gel mani at the same time. Everything was great: the store is clean, the lady doing my mani had great English, free bottles water, thorough work. The only thing keeping me from giving five stars is that the lady doing my pedi was slow.

Everything was spectacular EXCEPT the medical care I received. The waiting room, exam room, and restroom were spotless, and the MA and office staff were nice. The PA who was working on the day I COMPLETELY BLEW ME OFF. Ignored my symptoms, and told me that what I'd already done to relieve my symptoms were pointless (I know enough being raised by a NP to know that they weren't). She didn't even do an exam until I ASKED HER TO. She didn't ask me any questions, and didn't listen it what I was saying. She offered a shot of a pain killer and I told her that I wasn't interested in pain relief...I wanted to take care of what was causing the pain...a few minutes later the MA walked in with the shot. ATE YOU KIDDING ME? WAS SHE EVEN LISTENING?! WebMD will be more helpful than this place.

I called at 8pm and Dave was at our house in Avondale by 8:30. Our garage door had a broken spring which he was able to quickly replace. Added bonus...the door is quieter than it ever has been!! Dave was personable and friendly, I would be comfortable with him even if my husband wasn't home. We will definitely call again if/when any issues arise.

I absolutely love the strawberry and sweet potato salad and their cucumber lemonade! This is a family favorite!
