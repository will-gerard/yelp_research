Like the other reviewers, I have had to wait well over an hour for an oil change--even with an appointment.  Any reviewer who says these guys are honest has an ulterior motive.  I bought a 3 oil change for the price of one deal on living social, and this place was the only place open on weekends.  The very first time I went in, they told me my wheels had to be balanced.  I asked how much, they said $7 total.  When I left, they charged $7 per tire.  Ended up paying more than if I'd paid for the oil change.  The last time (and it will be the last time ever), they recommended a list of repairs as long as my arm, INCLUDING the easily verified "your radiator only has water in it and needs to be flushed."  All amounting to nearly $1000.  I took it to my normal mechanic to check out the list.  NOT ONE THING ON THE LIST NEEDED DOING.  The only thing that needed attention was a fraying serpentine belt which cost less than $200.  If you must go here for oil or tires, that's fine.  But be prepared for a wait.  And DON'T LET THEM ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR ENGINE.

Pasta and prawns was excellent, and server was attentive.  Good wine.  Extremely courteous.  I ordered the Calamari by mistake instead of the fried mushrooms.  Didn't really eat any of it because I'm not a fan of fried squid.  The server noticed we weren't touching it, and the manager came out to make sure everything was okay.  I explained the mistake and how it wasn't anything wrong with the food, and he comped it anyway.  That alone is enough to get us to go back.
