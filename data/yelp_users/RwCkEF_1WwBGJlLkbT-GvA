Whenever I am up in the Chandler area visiting friends this is a go to. It's tucked away in a little strip mall and is a secret I want to keep to myself here in Tucson. Locally owned Mediterranean with a revolving menu. The have something to offer for everyone. Small but cozy every table inside has a view of the kitchen and friendly staff. They have small plates to big shareable platters to sample. The staff is knowledgable and can make a recommendation to suit your tastes. The happy hour offers great deals of you are checking it out for the first time.  If you are a first timer you have to try their hummus made in house and the dolmades. Portion size is great and everything tastes fresh. Make sure to ask about the rotating cheesecake flavors.   Faves: gyros, Greek salads, and red pepper hummus

Wonderful! Sat at the bar to watch the cooking in action. The chef was pleasant and even let us taste the food he was prepping for later that week.

Catching up on my reviews from recent adventures! I had company in town from Cali so the natural thing to do is find a great winery up close to Phoenix right? So I this one is a bit out of the way and the drive out there is a bit daunting. From the website you would never know this is literally 4 blocks outside of downtown Florence. It really is more of a wedding venue than a true winery. Went on a Friday afternoon. Got there and there was no staff to let us know how to get around the place, just a lot of little wooden signs. There was a big group who had rented out the place for lunch so that's where everyone was. Once I found the tasting room there was only one staff member to do tastings, give you info, and serve the party so if she was busy you were a bit lost. I never got any info on the place and there wasn't much available to find on my own. Although the wine tasting was cheap ($5 for 3 tastes) most of the wine wasn't from the area. I went through the bottles in my own that were on the counter to find out which ones were actually from the winery itself (or even AZ). It was peaceful and cozy but unlike a tasting room you would be used to. Had a good adventure with company but I would travel out of your way unless you were going to a wedding.

Stayed here last week for the RUSH concert. Had an amazing time and this hotel is in an amazing location. I was able to book the UBER rate which not only was a great price but included a $20 uber credit to get  around downtown. This hotel is funky and neat looking and the rooms are quite large for the price. You can walk to baseball, music, and food/drink. The staff was fun, even though there were a TON of people there for the concert. I have stayed in Kimpton hotels before and have not been disappointed. The only suggestion I could make would be for you to sign up for the rewards ahead of time to take advantage of free wifi and a cocktail.   Keep it up Kimpton, maybe in the future have a more detailed map of your trendy wonders since sometimes its hard to find all the goodies.

Was up in the area for a work conference and decided to do a mini Scottsdale brew pub tour. It was the promise of beer cheese fondue that lured me to this spot for lunch. I figured lunch wouldn't kill me.  Was greeted by the floor manager and he confirmed my Open Table reservation. It wasn't busy at all for early lunch on a weekday but filled up very quick. You can be casual or business and feel at ease here.   Many local brew options, along with some specialties and surprises. Make sure to check out the tap and the brew pairings they offer. Chalkboard menus let you know they are on top of it.   Went with the cuban sandwich with fries that yes i dipped in my beer cheese fondue appetizer. Delish! High class bar food at your service. The manager checked in and chatted it up, along with our wonderful waiter.   Check this place out to see a little Scottsdale casual brew pub action.  Faves: beer cheese fondue, atmosphere.

In town for work down the street and stumbled upon this awesomeness by walking by before the crazy dinner crowd. Very typical taphouse, micro brew decor with a trendy little twist with the glass walls and metal.   Even though it was early, staff was friendly and eager to help. Happy hour has half off all apps. They brew their own awesomeness, so if you havent been there before tell them and they can give you the run down.   Oh did i mention some home town props, this place is out of DuPage County Illinois, specifically Warrenville, right by where i grew up so it was awesome to see the Blackhawks flag flying since they just won the cup!!! They even have some omage in the beer names.  The menu was pretty diverse, with the usual burger and fry fare, along with some Arizona, green chili, smoky pepper treats to try. Give this place a try if you are in town and want to just hang out and relax.  Faves: cinnamon root beer, hummus, beer fries
