Very helpful staff for my first time renting and the guy in the snowboard department was very knowledgeable and helpful. Made my first time much less intimidating.

Absolutely ridiculous that I have to wait an hour to pick up a prescription refill that I was notified was filled a week ago because there are "39 people" ahead of me, with only 2 people in the entire store. I understand that many prescriptions are filled electronically these days but whatever happened to customer service? They can't adjust to fill one easy refill prescription for someone who is in store?
