This is absolutely an amazing restaurant. Each time that I've come here, I've received excellent service and been served delicious food. The patio is beautiful so that's always been where I've enjoyed the meal. The servers are excellent at recommending wines. Last time I had the duck, which was phenomenal. Just come here, you won't regret it.

I went here for my parents' anniversary. We were seated and had to wait 5-10 minutes for anyone to approach us. The server never properly greeted us and explained the special they were having. It was Easter and they had grilled lamb apparently but nobody really bothered to explain this to us. After waiting for so long for the server to come over, I got up and asked the nearest waiter if I could speak to the manager. A few minutes later, a woman approached us and asked if everything was ok. I explained my issues to her and she half-apologized while suggesting a free dessert and that was that.   The rest of the experience was ok. Server did what he was supposed to do but things never really took off. The food was good but not at all worth the expensive prices. I had the grilled Ahi.   I had gone to IHOP in the morning for breakfast and received extraordinarily better service there. I have no plans to return and would not recommend anyone else to go here. There are much better restaurants in the area like House of Tricks.

This is the best bar and grill in Tempe. All of the food is tasty and there is big list of drafts. The rotating specials are great especially Taco Tuesday, Thursday night 2-for1, and their $1 Coors Light drafts during lunch hour. Devil's has so many TVs around the bar, you'll never have a problem watching a game. The servers are always quick and work hard. They also handle large groups well.  The huge parking lot is a plus since you'll never spend time searching for a spot like on Mill. Huge convenience factor.

I was very excited to get the chance to eat here. They have really good, authentic Spanish food like I had while studying abroad in Spain. Great atmosphere in the Cosmopolitan. Our waitress was excellent giving a very thorough overview of the menu and a good recommendation for a bottle of wine. She knew a lot about the restaurant's history and that of the chef. A nice touch was the custom drink list on an ipad left on the table; first time seeing that.   The tapas themselves were very good. We tried an assortment of tapas, but did not have the paella. Next time, we will try that. I will definitely return next time I am in Las Vegas.

They always have hot, original glazed donuts coming off the line and they always taste great. There is always a trivia question on the whiteboard and if you guess the right answer they'll give you another original donut for free. Coffee is pretty good too. I'll keep coming back here.
