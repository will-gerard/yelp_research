My room was huge. Whenever I stay in a hotel with a room larger than my apartment I feel a little sad, but then soak up all the space like a mad woman. The location was very convenient to my Scottsdale office and there is a ton to walk to within a mile radius. The fitness center was small but had adequate and nice equipment and was very clean. It was silent in my room and every team member I interacted with was extremely nice. I'll definitely stay here again next time I am in Scottsdale.   DFTBA ~ chase

The majority of my travel is for work so when I'm at an airport I look for certain things:  Quiet spaces to work - this more or less does not exist at LAS thanks to the loud slot machines all over every terminal.   Areas to charge my laptop/phone - if you want to stand in a cramped hallway right outside the bathrooms I suppose this can happen.   Plenty of seating space for passengers - LAS has packed terminals flooded with passengers in various stages of drunkenness. Good people watching (shout out to the lady flying in her bikini) but also annoying (shout out to all the drunken bachelorette parties).   Great restaurants for long layovers - I guess if a martini counts as dinner this is OK.   LAS more or less fails for my needs, but it's not the worst airport I've ever been in.   #BeAwesome ~ chase

The salad I got was pretty gross. The focaccia bread was good. The gelato was worth it.   I wish they were able to offer the "Gelato Wars" flavors year round. One of the staff brought me out a taste of caramel corn and it was amazeballs. They still have a huge selection of standard flavors that are all delicious. I got a large and nibbled on it for three days so the portion sizes are generous. Considering it's right across the street from the hotel I always stay at I'll definitely be back.

This is my favorite place to go when I am visiting my Scottsdale office. The PB&J greek yogurt parfait is the business. Banana, blueberries, strawberries, yogurt, granola, and a generous dollop of peanut butter. A perfect balanced breakfast for me. The cold brew coffee is good and very strong.   They also have an amazing menu of juices, smoothies, healthy salads and sandwiches. Healthy + delicious = super win. Highly recommend.   Be Awesome ~ chase
