OK so this is my first review in a very long time, but I just can't keep quiet any longer. My husband is a big yelper but sometimes he does not tell the whole "truth".  So the other night, my Husband decided we should try something totally different and go "Green". I love trying new places, I was down for the challenge. As usual, I went onto to YELP and looked at reviews. They were pretty positive, so it was a go.  Well first of all I think people are just not honest. The ONLY reason to go to this restautant is if you are a vegan otherwise stay away.   First of all, we walk in and it is chaos. A nice sign indicating please seat yourself or order at counter would be very helpful. So we look over the menu. I have to admit the idea of "mock" meat just does not sound good.  Now don't get me wrong I go vegetarian all the time at restaurants. I have to admit that Chelsea's Kitchen makes an excellent black bean burger. Anyways, we start off with mock chicken wings, I would be lieing if I did not tell you I think I might have vomited a little in my mouth. So gross.   Next, we try some artichoke dip, that was actually good because it was semi normal. I order the veggie burger. I have eaten plenty of boca burgers in  my day, but this was just gross. WHen I order a veggie burger I don't need it to look like an actual burger patty. It was pink inside. Again, I could not even eat it, I thought I was going to be sick. If I wanted to get an actual burger, I would have gone to LGO and gotten a burger.  Needless to say, I will not be going back. Just riddle me this, if you don't eat me then why do you insist in making your food appear as meat??? I don't like tuna fish, and the last thing I would want is my steak to look and smell like tuna fish!!

Have you ever been to Luby's? Well if you have, think Luby's with bbq food and no lady walking around refreshing your coffee or tea. That is Joes. Look if I had people in from out of town, I would drive them by and say this place was on food network, now lets go somewhere else to eat!  I really don't want to be mean, but there was nothing that great about this place. And yes the chicken breast was processed! I was a little grossed out, and the sides were blah!  This cookie that someone on yelp raved about.. dry and ehh. It was no paradise or tammie co cookie.  Joe I think your ideas are great and enjoyed Liberty Market. I still really want to try the Farm Grill, but am a little hesitant.

After experiencing many of the other "finer" steak restaurants in the area it was only inevitable that I try Donovans. I have had a gitt certificate from there for sometime, thus we had a reason to try.  It was a Saturday night and the place was pretty busy for the country being in the midst of a recession. My husband and I got there a little before the rest of our party. We sat at the bar that definetly had a cool vibe. I had a decent glass of wine and my husband had an overpriced martini, that he enjoyed.  Once the rest of the party arrived (my brother) we were seated. There seem to be some confusion at first to who our waiter was and this set the mood for the rest of the evening.  I am a huge fan of Mastro's and Capital Grill, therefore I compare all restaurants to their quailty and service. Donovans just could not meet that burden.   Seared Ahi = ehh. It looked as if it had been sitting out for awhile. When I eat ahi i like to look as fresh as it can, obviously.  Wedge = My husband orderd the wedge. It was the weakest wegde I have ever seen. Honestly, they should be embarassed.  Ribeye = I am not a fan of ribeye, it is too fatty for my taste, however, I hate ordering my own steak because I never finish it so I share with my husband. He is on a ribeye kick at this moment. Anyways, I found it charred, dry, and overly fatty.  Peppercorn filet = My brother ordered this filet and seemed to enjoy it. Though he did note that it was definetly not worth the sticker price,  Mac and Cheese = AWFUL... go to capital grill you will thank me later!  Overall had I not eaten in other steak restuarants maybe Donovan's could fool me. If you are going to spend the money definetly go to Mastros, Capital Grill or even Durants (very cool place)!  In the end it was just ehhh and not worth the money!

First let me start by saying, I rarely rate a restaurant with 5 stars! But Mastros is always top notch, and this time we went was no different.  Last night it was my husband's birthday and his choice was mastros. Now why city hall v. mastros, thats simple we live in Tempe! City Hall is closer and it allowed us to stop by Nordstroms before so he could pick out his gift.  Well we arrived a little early before the rest of our party  so we could enjoy some cocktails in the lounge. Yes the drinks are over priced, but I understand where I am so it is ok. My husband got a vodka martini with blue cheese olives. Now you have to understand not eveywhere has blue cheese olives, so this was huge. I took the bartender's recommendation as to a glass of pinot noir, it was delicious!  Once the rest of our party arrived we were seated. As soon as we are seated, the bread arrives. Now most restaurants bring bread to the table, but not all restaurants have warm pretzel bread. My husband and my brother requested a extra basket of pretzel bread!  For starters we had the oysters and shrimp. Ok this is why I LOVE this place, they have the biggest shrimp anywhere. I have been to many steakhouses all over the valley but none have this size shrimp, and none have atomic horseradish. Aww atomic horseradish is the best thing EVER! I hate when you get mild horseradish. Not sure what mastros does to the horseradish,but having my sinuses cleared is truly an amazing experience!  My brother opted for a ceasar salad, which he enjoyed. It was a nice size and definetly could be shared. Not too long ago we ate at Capital Grille and found their salads very small, so this was good.  Everyone at the table got the filet. I actually split the filet with my sister,and later found out that there was not split charge, another plus. Anyways, the filet was juicy and well flavored. Excellent!  For sides, my brother has the twice baked, which is one of his favorites. The rest of us shared the steamed asaparagus and wasabi mashed potatoes. The wasabi mashed were amazing. I was surprised! But they had a nice hint of wasabi, very good.  For desert, since it was my husband's birthday he got a complimentary butter cake with creme fraiche (mastro's signature desert). Well lets just say I had to be separated from the cake!!

Ok here is the short and not so sweet.  This place is not good, over priced, and located in the back of the biltmore for a good reason. Just think reasonably good restaurants ie, zin burger, tru foods, capital grill are all visible in the front of the biltimore. Ok enough said on location.  We came after happy hour, apparently the time where this place is semi decent because food and drinks are half off.  We ordered drinks that were overpriced and short pours. It is a wannabe higher end wine lounge. ok on to the overpriced and over salted food.  Beet salad was decent. Wild mushroom pizza was more salt than pizza. Burger was burnt and truffle fries were ok.  The kicker of the evening were when 2 women showed up and decided to sit next to us, when the whole lounge was empty. Anyways, they were loud and winey and complaining how they had been recently dumped (I wonder why?) Then Christopher Gross came outside. My husband and I thought he was making the rounds, which would have been nice, but that was not the case. He sat his right next to the obnoxious girls and fed into their bitching. He even supplied them with champagne.  Well I guess if my restaurant was completely empty I would hit on pathetic patrons too. So you guessed it, I will not be returning.

I have been here a million times since it opened. I am never disappointed! It is a great place to try out different quailty beers. If you are into bud light PLEASE STAY AWAY!   My husband and I typically go once a week to sample the new brews on tap. We definetly have some favorites, but it is fun to try new ones too!  The staff is knowledgable and super friendly. They are excellent in matching beers to your what you like. If they can't find anything in Taste they can easily go next door to Tops and continue the search.  Another great thing is the bar mix that is complementary. Not many places do that anymore. Also you can bring in from Thai Basil or the pizza place next door if you want.  If you have not been you need to go!

So I will not say I am beer snob, but I do enjoy a well crafted beer. After 3 years of living in new england and being spoiled by all the micro breweries and sam adams, I am a little more critical. It is true I will no longer even touch some beers that in college would have been preferred. So enough said....  My Husband and I were encouraged to try this new brewery out. It is near university and price. In a newer shopping center, which we missed on arrival. I was expecting a papago brewery/four peaks atomsphere, totally the opposite. Not saying that it a bad thing, but defiently the brightest and cleaniest brewery I have been too.  So we got there about 7:15 pm on a Tuesday, not too crowded, the way I like it.  We shared the sampler. I am not going to type out my review of each beer. On average they looked like beer but tasted like water with some hops and carbonation. Nothing special. No session beer to recommend.   I guess if I had to choose one, it would be the IPA. It was ok for an IPA, but if I had to drink something I would choose that.   Though the brewery def has potential. I do like the idea of bringing your own food. That is a great draw. Also keeps overhead low. Genius if you ask me. It has gives them time to work on getting the beer to taste better and not the food.  Will I be back? If papago, taste of tops, and four peaks runs out of beer, for sure I will be there ;)

So every now and then it is time to try that little hole in the "shopping center" in hopes of finding a local gem, well keep looking! First of all, I wished I would have checked yelp prior to going out to this place because my experience was similar if not identical to Chris B.  Our party decided to try Mad Chef after purchasing a coupon from restaurant.com. Let me just notify everyone.. HAD THERE NOT BEEN A COUPON WE WOULD NEVER HAD GONE!! The other party we were with uses the coupons often and has never had any issues thus far until tonight.  Upon arriving at the restaurant,  there were no cars around. Sign #1. We walked in to find no one in the dining room and a few patrons in the bar. Sign #2.  We are seated prompty in the dining room. Our server was friendly and asked if we like drinks. We checked out the beer menu and saw that there were some craft brews. We decided to each get a sample. I went with the "hop head". This was suppose to be three IPA style drafts. When served the sampler, I asked which was which, she has no idea. She knew one was 60 minute, gordons double ipa and smithwicks ??? What? She said that ran out of the other pale ale and gave me smithwicks. Sign #3.  I should also mention that they had four peaks pumpkin porter on draft. As I am a huge four peaks fan, but not much a porter fan I requested a sample of this years porter. I was flat out refused!!! My husband in the end decided to just get a pint, but seriously!! Sign #4   On to the food, it was ehhhh. Probably would have given the place another star had the next part of our adventure not occurred. Though I will point out, the food was not to the point that I would make a special trip out there. I mean they took costco frozen food and definetly spiced it up.  Now this is the part where I wish I would have checked yelp as I ususally do and we could have been at papago enjoying a taste of any beer and GOOD FOOD! So at the end of the meal we hand our server the restaurant.com coupon. She immediately points out that this should have been presented at the beginning of the meal and besides they don't take them anymore. WHAT??? But it is on the site, someone in my party paid for it, it is valid! I proceed to argue with her for a brief moment when she smartly decideds to bring over the manager.  What the manager does not understand is that I argue for a living, whethere I am right or wrong I can argue alll day!! Anyways, he starts giving me his sob story of how he requested not be on restaurants.com and there is a lawsuit, blah blah. I tell him it is not our fault they made a bad marketing decision, but not that bad because it got us in there right??  This goes on for another few minutes. I could care less about the $25 coupon, it was more of the princpal. He kept saying he would have "worked a deal" if we told him at the beginning about the coupon. How the heck were we to know? I told him he should post a sign and give notice. Long story short, he failed and refused to honor the coupon. Sign #5.   All he had to do was honor the coupon and there is a chance we may have been back. Now never. Also, if you are wondering how this place has any good reviews.... I would like to point out that those reviews are from yelpers with only 1 or 2 reviews... follow me??  What is the moral of this tale, READ YELP!!

I really want to give Nobuo 5 stars. The meal was fantastic, however, it is just hard to swallow the high prices. Don't get me wrong I think it is worth it, but it is expensive.  Anyways, my husband and I and another couple decided to try Teeter House last night. I have been wanting to try it for months, so I was totally excited. We got there early on a Friday night and were seated right away.  We basically ordered everything on the menu and all the food was awesome! We had to order double of some items because the portion size is a little small considering there were four of us!  My favorites were the snap peas, sea bass, grapefruit and hamachi, and the tofu mousse!! Also, they have a great drink menu.  Already planning a trip back :)

This pains me to give Jersey Mike's such a low rating, but they are ridiculous. I have not yelped in years, but after today's experience I am just beside myself. Long story short, I am a huge fan of Jersey Mikes. My typical go to is the turkey and provolone, but I am currently 6 months months pregnant and cold deli meat is a no no. Also, I usually order online from my office which I prefer but because the website does not allow to customize I have to walk in (another thing that needs to be fixed). I go in and tell the guy I would like a grilled chicken breast and provolone sub. The guy gets a blank look and about to pass out... he says what? I again, this time a little slower, grilled chicken breast and provolone. You would have thought I just asked him to perform brain surgery. Note I did check the menu prior to ordering to see that they have chicken breasts, so it is not like they do not have them. Finally, he starts making the sub, though he decides to let me know how ordering off menu throws off inventory??? WTF? First do I look like I care. I all of sudden had a flash back to ten years ago when Chris Bianco refused to change an ingredient on a pizza I ordered, really??? really??? Also, I have attempted to order the same sub at other locations in the valley and get the same idiotic dumbfounded response each time. Enough is enough.. sorry Jersey Mikes but we are done.
