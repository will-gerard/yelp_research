Postinos is one of my favorite places to go monthly for a light dinner and wine. I get the bruschetta every time and I am never disappointed. The servers are always very knowledgeable on wine and will give you a great suggestion. I have had some of their Panini's and soups and those were also delicious! The Arcadia location is also my favorite Postinos to go to; I love the atmosphere.

The best sushi I've ever had! You would not expect it but don't judge a book by its cover! I don't know how they do it but everything I've had is amazing. My one complaint is that the restaurant is so small... There are seriously probably 8 tables? So sometimes you have to wait quite a while. It's worth the wait!

Walked in to get a finger tattoo touched up.  Tanner took us right in. He was very friendly and did a great job! I will definitely return for my next one!

I recently started coming to Salon Tru when my stylist Kristi moved to this salon.  The salon is very nice and clean but the real reason I love it is Kristi. She always does an amazing job on my color and cuts and I always get compliments on how great my color is. Kristi has a true talent and she can create any look you want. I would definitely recommend her to anyone I know because I know they wont be disappointed!

I've taken my dog here for grooming 5 times and every time he looks great! I like that they don't keep the dogs in cages and after he's groomed they keep all the clean dogs together. He may not always like going but I know he's in good hands.

I love everything about this place :) especially the fact we can ride our bikes here! The only downside is there is not a lot of indoor seating. The breakfast and coffee are great you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!

I was here last week with 3 girls friends. It was a Wednesday night so it was not very busy. We ordered some sushi and drinks. I had the only Chardonnay they offer and the second glass tasted pretty off like it was old.  I had each one of my friends at the table take a small sip and everyone agreed there was something wrong with it. When I told our server she took the wine and said she would bring me a new one and she did.  A few minutes later the "manager" came over and was asking "who had the wine" and he had an attitude about the way he asked. He wanted to let ME know that it was the same wine and nothing was wrong with the first one. I said well it tasted off and instead of apologizing he proceeded to tell me it was the exact same... pretty much trying to make me look stupid.  Definitely wont be back unless its happy hour and I won't be getting any wine. I am giving one star for management. The food and other service would be about 3 stars...

I wish this place was good, it's not. I've eaten there many times and the last time was my last. My miso soup was cold I had to send it back... All of the rolls are a different version of a California roll and don't taste fresh to me. I went with my husband and for 1 appetizer and 3 rolls it was about $80.... That's without any alcohol too! We've added to our list of restaurants we don't eat at. Hopefully something better will take over soon!

We went on a Thursday night around 6 PM thinking it would not be busy.We were quoted 20 to 40 minute wait but ended up getting seated after an hour and 15 minutes. There were about 5 open tables when we got seated. Our server came by once and we ordered everything at that point. He never returned to see if we needed anything else not even another drink. We never got our waters we asked for as well. Then we had to hunt him down for our check which he brought 10 minutes later. I won't be returning. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because my tacos were good.

Will never be returning to Picazzos! My pizza had a hair in it and the mushrooms tasted slimy. The service was even worse! I wish they had better food because I live very close by. It seems like I'm not the only person who had bad service maybe they need to look at these reviews...

Annoying.... I just want a carwash... I'll even buy the VIP but the up selling gets old and every time I go here the workers are creepy and unprofessional. Won't be going back.

I had an amazing birthday dinner here. I am still craving the sticky buns which they bring you before your meal. The food was amazing the service was also excellent. I will definitely be back for another special occasion! The food took a while to come out but our server was apologetic.

Not a good experience here today.... When you come in with a friend and want to get pedicures at the same time they should be honest if it is a possibility. Today I got a bad pedicure while my friend waited next to me. They never asked us if it was ok for us to get done at separate times. A walk in client came in after us and they proceeded to start on her first. They wanted to start on hers when mine was almost done. They apologized but didn't do anything to make the situation better. I will never return here.....

These places can be hit or miss but now that I know who to go to I just make sure to make an appointment. Christy is the best at eyebrows! I won't go to anyone else :)

This is the third time I have eaten at Iron Chef. Its pretty good sushi and its right by my house.  The server next door at Nicks had told me it was dirty and the kitchen was gross. I don't know why but I decided to try it out again.  Immediately my napkin had a long black hair on it...I wasn't too upset just asked for a new plate.  Then my boyfriends plate was sticky...he asked for a new plate...my soy sauce cup had an old piece of rice in it...asked for a new one of those too...the server kept apologizing which was nice but come on...3 dirty things and we haven't even gotten our food yet! Our sushi arrived and it was ok...it wasn't as cold as I would like which worried me.  They gave us a cucumber salad for free...wow thanks. It's decent sushi for a really good price you just have some risks involved when you go there with cleanliness...

Went here on Saturday night for a date night with my boyfriend. Both of us had never been here before and we were craving some Italian food.  I had seen on the menu they make their pasta in house and the reviews looked good so we decided to try it. I am so happy we did! I had the bolognese pasta and he had the spaghetti and meatballs they were both excellent dishes. For desert we had some salted carmel thing I cant remember the name but it was delicious!!! We will definitely be returning. The service was great too!!!

Worst chorizo I have ever tasted... Never again!!! I ordered the Arizona omelet and it was covered in "ranchero" sauce that had the worst flavor. I will never be back.

Horrible customer service. I had never been to this location and I could not find it my first time. I was 7 min late and they said they couldn't treat me.... I have been trying to get an appointment for 4 months. I will not continue my membership when it is done not worth it!

First time eating here today, we will definitely be back! The staff was so friendly and the owner even checked on us. The potion sizes were huge we could definitely have split a meal. I'm glad we found this hidden gem in our neighborhood!

I recently came here to get lash extensions with Alicia. It was my first time getting them and I was nervous because I have seen some lashes that don't look very good. When I was done I couldn't believe how good they looked. I have gotten so many compliments everywhere I go! People think they are my real lashes too! If you're looking for someone who is amazing at lashes go to Alicia! Side note it's been 2 weeks and they still look great!

Just walked in and no one acknowledged me for a good 5 min... There are bells on the door and they definitely saw me.... I walked out. Not a good way to get a customer.

Love love love Dr. Heffner! I've gotten Botox from her twice and even brought my mom in right before my wedding. My mom was a first timer and her results were amazing!!! Dr. Heffner really knows a lot about placement of Botox and I am looking forward to getting some juvederm in the future. I would definitely recommend her and this office to anyone.

I have been going to orange theory for 5 months now and I love it! Every workout is challenging and I'm never bored because it's something different every day. The trainers really care about you getting the most out of your workout and are very encouraging. I was nervous to start but I'm so happy I did, I am in better shape than I have been for a while and I am terrible at running but now I can actually run!

I recently had a facial and microdermabrasion with Elvira. I bought a groupon, and it was definitely worth the price. My skin immediately looked better! I can't wait to go back and try other services they offer!

Came in during happy hour so a lot of things are $1 off... We ordered the guacamole, shrimp coctel, and carne asada torta. Everything was really good and it was definitely more than enough food for two people. I can't wait to come back!

This place is really good! I came here for the first time and got an iced coffee and their BLTAA. The coffee was so good and the sandwich was amazing too! It came with a side of fresh roasted vegetables. I can't wait to try more things on the menu!

We have been wanting to try this place as it is right down the street. I am so glad we did! The food is not your typical Mexican food and they have a lot of choices. We split the blue corn enchiladas and a cheese crisp. All of the salsas are really good too! I had a skinny margarita which is sweeter than I usually like but overall he service and food was great and we will definitely be back!

Great patio and restaurant for big groups. They also have a lot of TVs for people who want to watch football. My burger and sweet potato tots were really good. I'm not sure the name of the burger I had maybe the truffle burger? Everyone that ate a burger in my group enjoyed it. I will definitely be back for another adult milkshake, the oreo milkshake with vodka and baileys is addicting, you could taste the alcohol just enough but it wasn't overpowering. I will definitely be back!

I'm seriously done with this place! I wanted to like it, they have good colors but I've given them way to many chances. I've been in 4 times the best time was the first time and that's what kept me coming back. The last time I went there I got a gel manicure and after the 5th coat she realized the color wasn't going on very well..... Basically she had to start over from scratch... Instead of taking of the polish the right way she used a drill and file turning my nails into nothing. She tried to convince me to get a different color with glitter so it wouldn't show the ridges... I didn't come in with ridges! I picked a similar color to the first one and she rushed and did a terrible job. Even she said it looked bad but charged me anyway. I promised it would be the last time but they gave me a gift card for a free manicure because of everything I went through. Today came in to use my gift card and got sliced so badly by the file it was almost unbearable to finish my manicure. Then she said my skin is too thin.... So unapologetic. I am not coming back here, they have had enough chances.

Came here for the first time last week and it was great! I was disappointed because they were out of a lot of things but we ordered shrimp, muscles and lobster. We had the trifecta sauce and mild seasoning. I would definitely come here again and try other things. Be prepared to get messy!!!!

Friendly service and good pedicure. Unfortunately this will not be my new manicure place. My gel manicure lasted 6 days before it started to peel up on the edges..... I usually get at least 2 weeks wear.

I don't know why I decided to give this place more chances. I came in tonight and got steak lettuce wraps, it was the special and recommended by staff. I have to say I am not impressed, I barely ate half of them. The meat does not even taste like steak and I was given 4 small pieces of lettuce, not worth $11.00. Now I am sure I will not be back.

My favorite nail salon! I drive all the way from Gilbert to come here :) they have the best colors to pick from and all of the nail techs do a great job. I get a full two weeks from my gel manicures and the pedicures are great too! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because they are always so busy that even if you make an appointment you end up waiting for a long time.

I love coming here! This place is really fun for big groups! The only problem is you can't make reservations and on weekends the wait can be 2 hours! I think they should take reservations even if you need a credit card to hold it.

I have mixed feelings about this place. Coming from California it's hard to compare any other boba teas. I've been here 3 times and tried something new each time. The menu is pretty confusing. I found some of the drinks too sweet for my liking but overall the quality is good and I will come back! The staff is really friendly and helpful too.

Ordered take out last night, it was my first time eating from here but I was in the area and heard good things. I ordered two rolls the salmon love roll and the lollipop roll. Both of the rolls were really good, the fish was really fresh. It took over 40 minutes to get the two rolls. But I will definitely be back to try more.
