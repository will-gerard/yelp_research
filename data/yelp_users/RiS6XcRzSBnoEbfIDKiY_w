I order the Asian Veggie sandwich and it was spicy . I really enjoyed it for the first time . My girlfriend order the Asian Grilled Chicken that was better tasting then mines and her bread was warm . Mmmmhh but the best part was the Mango Smoothies if I learned one thing about this place I will always come here for that ... Best Mango Smoothies Ever !!!

I just Moved to AZ and crystal was the first Stylist I went to and thankfully I have better luck with my first pick .. I'm very picky with having heat in my hair and she not only limited the heat but understands and actually listens to her clients. She also trimmed my hair and I really enjoyed her company ... Till we again !!!

The food is tasteless because this fucking awful ass , stingy ass manger is not giving the customers the opportunity to get the. Condiment they need instead this greedy motherfucker got them station behind the counter were he can tell customer if they need extra go to the line where u will be charge . I bet he would charge for refill had the despisers been station behind the counter and not in the front , complete horrible service. He hates his job and it shows . First time here Last time here fucking jerks
