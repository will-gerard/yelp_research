So grossed out by this restaurant. Extremely pricey and disgusting when you walk in. CLEAN your restaurant or hire new staff.

What happen to Chilis. I used to eat at Chilis all the time. Great food and the Margaritas where always great. It's been about 5 years and I recently went. The Margaritas and service where great. The food was nothing like it used to be. I had the southwest egg rolls and the fajitas. The egg rolls tasted like something they bought in the frozen section of walmart. The fajitas came out with barley any veggies and only three tortillas. I was not happy and they have lost me as a customer

Never seen so many kids work so hard at a fast food restaurant. This place was crazy and they are getting them in and out. Great job manager

Love this place. Great for the kids and always clean. I can always tell when a restaurant has great management. Our kids never wait for a ticket attendant. This makes the experience for the parent enjoyable.

I eat here almost everyday. I own DCR Title and Registration which is next door. Fresh ingredients and I can have my burrito the way I want it. It's like the Subway of Mexican food. You tell them how you want it. The staff is always friendly and great prices.

It takes more than looks to make a restaurant successful. This place needs new management, poor service due to lack of servers. Know your surroundings, if you open a restaurant next to a ballgame be prepared for a crowd. I had the steak salad; Wow, it was a slice of very thin prime rib on a very basic salad.  When I say thin, I mean so thin it just disappeared in the salad. $14?

Pizza was great and the service was outstanding. My six and and nine year old sons have a new favorite place.
