Good steak...little over cooked but the bread makes up for it!

Walking distance from my house. Busy Friday- Sunday but the rest of the week is a good time to go.

You need some old 1980s movie? This is the place! Need some random CD that you cant find in a normal store like Target? This is your place....hours of fun filled CDs, DVDs and books!

Most of the time we like being here. The chicken strips are great. However, the service has been getting bad. The wait staff is lazy and never asks if we need anything.

I go to this place at least twice a month. Great food. Great people. Great suroundings.  They lost my ATM card once....not sure how! Just watch them when it comes to the bill.

If you like hip hop and strange people around you this is your place!!! They do have a fun small bar in the back that is good for  karaoke.

It's ok but not worth the gas driving there. Maybe if you have a really good drinking night in Tempe you should stop in.

We go to Chompies almost ever Saturday. Today we walked in, they sat three couples ahead of us. We asked for a booth. We were the only people waiting, sat for 15 minutes and looked to see the five booths open and available. We walked out and never going there again.

I hate Wal-Mart and the way they treat their employees. However, its next door to my house and its cheap. I guess this one is okay but I would rather go to the big one on Raintree and the 101.

Great bar! Enough room to relax and watch a UFC fight or football game. The food is perfect and a good choice from wings to salads.
