We went to the supposed fish fry last fri...it was supposed to last til 9pm. By 7 45  the server was rushing us to put in our order because they were sending the kitchen home.  To top it off, they were out of multiple things we tried to order...over all a sub par experience.

I ordered a tiny wedding cake from here when my husband and I eloped- it was not only beautiful, but delicious too!!!

Cameo is the best stylist I've ever had! The atmosphere here is relaxing & friendly. They also have wifi, so it's easy to work while getting worked on!

Hands down the best farmers market in the valley. The workers are incredibly knowledgeable and will help you transform your garden on to a mater piece! Be sure to get the fish oil fertilizer...I'm hooked!
