We loved coming here because they are open 24 hrs and the prices were great. In the last three months the service has been absolutely horrible! Linda is the only one who has her customer service together. Unfortunately she only works certain days. Service is bad! Bad! BAD!!! They are such joys of sunshine, I feel like they'd prefer that we didn't come here, like we are burdening them. I'll gladly go somewhere else if y'all are going to have such crap attitudes. Id like to add that our waitress was not pleasant. When it came time to pay the bill, I gave her cash. I put my hand out and she quickly put the money on the counter and walked away. That is a big No No for me. I've worked 16years in the customer service industry. You do not do that. We just left the restaurant. Literally, 10/2/15 10:57am. The manager wasn't in, I will be speaking to her today. I do not want anyone to lose their job, but a definite attitude adjustment is in order.

My one stop prop shop. Ive been coming to this store since I was a kid, I love Easley's and their prices!! Dont let the outside fool you, inside they are packed to the gills in spooky, magical, fun, creepy, and creative stuff! My only complaint is they are not open on Sundays. *sigh*

We love this place! Ive had the blueberry pie and the strawberry cream pie and its definitely a to do if you love pie.  My boyfriend and I had dinner here and it is very filling! Big portions and great service! Theresa was our server and you can just tell she loves her job! She sings, whistles and dances her way over to your table and she will even crack a joke to make you laugh. Superb!  For dinner we had the Prime rib with mashed potatoes and green beans, the meat loaf with mashed potatoes and green beans, the house bread, and a trip to the salad bar complimentary with dinner. ALL YUMMY!  The salad bar has a nice variety, I like peas on my salad and fresh peas they had indeed. The bread was warm and soft and yummy. The entrees were hot and perfect the way they came, not over salted or under spiced. My boyfriends prime rib was perfectly rare just the way he likes it.  For dessert we had pie, what a great way to top off a tasty dinner! As for our check, $44. We were very surprised and pleased at the cost. We will definitely be back again!!

I hate that my first negative review had to be on a place where I expected so much more.  I walked in to the shop, the front counter person was helping another customer. The customer was on her way out I stood LITERALLY in front of the counter looking at jewelry and not a single greeting. I proceeded to walk around the front area for a few minutes...still nothing. I went into the next room of product and looked at everything. I already had my eye set on a few things. I walked up towards the front counter area and another employee comes walking up, looked directly at me, and said nothing. She did however get into a conversation with the person behind the counter. Very chatty. Perhaps you should be more chatty with your customers. Here is a tip for you Frances people, if you want customers to actually buy things from you and return to your shop, GREET THEM! You both deserve a fish to go with that chip on your shoulder.

Uh, Im almost hesitant to share my secret love/obsession, but its too good not to! Words cannot describe the swellegant environment that is Red Hot Robot. Just go to the store and see for yourself, you will thank me....or maybe you wont. You may become addicted to vinyl toys and then every paycheck you will find yourself buying freaking awesome goodies from the trinket peddler known as Jason who sits behind the counter with a candied grin recognizing he has hooked yet another sucker in for his sweet merchandise.....I love you Red Hot Robot (whispers) I love you.

I found this gym here through YELP. I went in for a free class and immediately felt at home. There was a 6 week special and after that I signed up for a 1 year membership. This has got to be one of the most amazing experiences in my life. Im addicted.  Things you should know: *This place is VERY clean *Very good equipment  *You will sweat and soak through your clothes *You will be sore *You will bruise *You might puke *You will love it!  This is not for folks looking to do an aerobics kind of class, this is Muay Thai, traditional Thai boxing. The instructors will make you work!    The kids classes are amazing, these guys teach discipline and are so kind with little ones that its worth watching the kids classes. Its the cutest thing EVER! I'm definitely going to try and get my niece and nephew signed up this summer!

I fell in love with this place as soon as I set foot into it. I can always find the perfect accessory and the cutest gifts. I get lost in the kids clothing, it is the most adorable stock ever! Jinia and Althea are the sweetest ever!   Oh yes, and the fact that there is a coffee shop in the next room over is a HUGE bonus. Fashion and coffee, need I say more??   These ladies are crafty, sweet and very fashion forward. It doesnt get any better than this place.

My reviews are few and far between. So when I review, you know its good!   First off, this place is clean, Gold Star #1.  It is a family owned business and they are super friendly Gold Star #2   The prices! Holy Smurfs! Dirt cheap! Gold Star #3  The location is excellent, midtown, and right next to Da Vangs. Same family, most excellent Pho. Gold Star #4  The quality, I was impressed, I ordered a Papaya banana boba and I waited unusually longer than I expected to. Why? Because the sweet lady behind the counter was carefully slicing FRESH papaya and bananas into the blender! Thats right. Like a precise surgery, these fruits were handled with such care and love. It is amazing! This earns the final Gold Star. I realize Yelp uses red stars, but in kindergarten it was TOTALLY awesome when you would get a gold star at the end of the week. Thus, I deem this place totally awesome.

You've got to go way faar back to dee islaaaands for dis kinda food mon, NO WAAY Mon! You can get it riiight heeer.  As a fan of Jerk Chicken and Plantains, I must say this place does it up right! This small quaint food joint comes with colorful surroundings, excellent service, smiles, yummy food, and the sweetest little lady behind the counter. Accent and all, they serve up the best Jerk Chicken Ive had in a while. A fair warning, this Jerk Chicken definitely has a kick! It bites you when you least expect it. this place COMPLETELY satisfied my craving for Jerk Chicken and Plantains. Which by the way I was told they do serve the green plantains if you ask for them! YUMM-O! I do believe this place will be a weekend ritual.

This place came recommended from a friend. I work near by so I had it delivered. They were spot on with delivery, the driver was friendly and I got a little punch card with my receipt.  I ordered the turkey and stuffing sandwich and when they say its piled high, they are not joking! The sandwich was very filling and yummy. The only thing I would add to it is a side of cranberry sauce. The acidic sweetness would play nicely with the creamy mayo and the herbs in the stuffing.  I ordered a brownie too. That's was delish! Well done folks! I'll be a repeat customer.

I stopped by the 7th at location today to get started on classes. The door was locked. The hours on yelp say they are open. I called the number and got the voicemail. It's one number for all three locations. This is annoying and bad business. I saw their advert on Facebook. I was really excited to join. This is just such a bummer.
