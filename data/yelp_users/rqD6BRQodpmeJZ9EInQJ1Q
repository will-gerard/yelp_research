Great dim sum restaurant, good selection of items as well as the regular menu. Prices aren't that bad, its about average for ala cart $8-10ish and the portion are fair also. Seems to be a busy place from what people have said n the staff even said the same but today when we came in it wasn't busy which was awesome. We got our food quik n our table was taken care of the whole time, my water cup never stayed empty at all our tea was always replaced. I'd definitely come back and even recommend it to friends n fam.

And its next to my complex. Of course id come bak.

I dont normally go this low on rating unless there is a problem & omg houston we had a problem. First off we got that we walked in 30 minutes to closing n didn't realize it til after we've ordered our food n i checked in on yelp n seen the time update. So on that note 3 more group of peeps show up b4 closing like 10 minutes prior. My tacos were expensive and they were tiny and the tortillas used was fuken stale ass hell with no flavor at all on the asada or the fish, then i had a shrimp ceviche and hell that shyt was horrible worst I'd ever tasted, then the horchata was just watered down even am/pm had better horchata n they're shyt sux but compared to this place yah..no! Got my son an ice cream wit churros n the chorros were also stale, smh! The absolute worst mexican restaurant i have ever been to, never again will i eat at this place.  Thats just my opinion, and i dont bullshyt when it comes to food, i tell it for what it is..bout the only thing good that came out of this dinner was the server kept coming to my table to check on us which is a plus, so service wise it was good. Quality of food was terrible! Waste of $33 bucks spent.

So far ive tried the ribeye burger n it was delicious,  one of the best burgers ive had in a while. So tonight imma try the 14" all meat pizza, wit pepperoni, sausage, ham n beef. It looks really good.  I hope its as good as the burgers.  Its also like a block from where I live so thats a big pkus n they deliver.  Saweeet!! They also serve alcoholic beverages n the wings I hear r amazingly good but ill try that next time...

Its a nice place to shoot, well regulated n safe. Nice helpful staff. I only wish it has a section wit steel hanging plates to shoot like Angeles crest shooting range in cali. Almost the same type o rules n range layout. I love hearing fullauto shooting next to me. Arizona gotta love it!! Prices for admission is fair bout $7 bucks a person, n u bring ur own ammo n u can buy targets or ur own (paper targets). Good place for practicing skills in close or distance shooting. N if ur hungry there is also a hotdog stand by the entrance. Nice clean facility.

Ok so decided to try this place out after reading all the reviews. Its sort of secluded in a empty plaza, a small hole in a wall i think but damn the food was gooooood! The family deal i got was 3 items to choose from and literally u choose any 3 ala carts not the ones they put together and if u want shrimp items its $2 xtra or fish items add $4 xtra. But they have a wide selection of food to choose from ala cart , lunch n dinner specials n some not even on the menu but they can cook it. I ordered the salt n pepper pork chops not on the menu but they cooked it cuz i seen that someone put it up on yelp n i showed them. It was ! The best chinese restaurant i found since i moved to Arizona, far from me like 30 minute drive but damn worth it...small venue so i can see it gettn packed fast but its worth it. The prices r fair n the portions is enough. Service was pretty good also. And if u like picture menus its all over the walls of the restaurant cuz sometimes u just wanna see the food. The fish with balck bean sauce was awesome! We had tons of left overs not like all the other chinese restaurants ive been to in PHX those r weak n portions suk ass. This place is worth trying if u are in the mesa area, and there is a big asian grocery store across the street at another plaza that u can buy asian stuff. I'd recommend this place for sure and I'd deff make a stop if im in mesa area again..outstanding food!! 2 thumbs up from me..

This place over charged me for a 1 day car rental omg wtf! I online it was supposed to be a deal $66 estimate price but after going there n getting it the damn car was$114 n can u believe they had to do a fucking credit  on me! This is rediculous it must be an arizona thing cuz dollar in LA dont do none o that. THEY GIVE u the price per day n add 20% for deposit on top plus what ever taxes Thats it. I could o got a one day rental in LA for boUT $35 per day. This dollar blows.

Damn this place is definitely a 5 star. The food was so good and the portion was perfect,  I didn't even finish my meal. I ordered the mardi gras pasta which had big shrimps, prawn, sausages and the sauce was amazingly great tasting.  I also ordered the alligator nuggets as an appetizer and I was impressed,  that was the first tyme I tried alligator and maan it was good along with the sauce they give you with it. Our server a young black gurl, very curtious, helpful, knowledgeable, and on point with our drinks never had an empty glass to drink what ever it was. Kudos for the great service and amazing food. I cannot wait to come back n taste all the other food on the menu. It is a lil pricey so bring ur wallet but the portions are good. And the ambiance was cool, nice decos, fairly big establishment,  nice bar, n very very classy. MY NEW SEAFOOD SPOT IN AZ!!

This company was not very helpful to my needs. My son and his mom came in on the greyhound by sky harbor airport this morning at 3am. They said they need a booster for my 7yr old son. Well they didn't have a driver with one that was available.  Too bad so sad I had to go with another taxi company that would bring them to my residence in Phoenix. Sorry had to give you guys 1 star. ....you should always be accommodating to any customer needs as a taxi company. Will never call or use this place again.

K SO I HATE WORK RELATED CLINICS NORMALLY CUZ I FEEL THEY'RE FOR THE COMPANY. BUT THIS CONCENTRA WAS HUMBLE MAN, they took care od me n my coworker that brought me here. Snack ,water, then apoke wit the doctor n ahe was very helpful to my needs. Walked out in a brace, crutches, med prescriptions. Very helpful to everything. The past concentras I've been to in California were shitty just lame. I liked this environment alot n all the other staff was awesome too. Very curtious, great customer service. Probably cuz its 24hrs hahahaha. I didn't have to wait long either. Like 2.5 hrs in and out. In cali I'd o been there 5-6 hrs man. Thx to the staff.
