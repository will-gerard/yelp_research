My family and I went here for dinner a couple nights ago. Here are the reasons for the 1 star:  - The food tastes so-so. - There were 26 of us and they were going to charge us $1 per person for rice even though we had ordered many (overpriced) entrees. I mean, really?! - The baby-sized cups for water. I can't tell you how many times the cups had to be refilled because they were mini sized. It was laughable. - Lastly, we were celebrating our uncle's retirement party and brought a couple cakes. We asked to use their knife. As we were leaving, a lady (hostess? owner?) accused us of taking the knife even though we told her that we had left it on the table. She specifically told one of my cousins that if he didn't hand it to her directly that she would charge us ... this is after we had just spent $300 for our so-so, overpriced dinner.  Never going there again nor recommending it to anyone - should have looked at the Yelp reviews before coming here, especially when there are better places nearby.

RA sushi is so-so for sushi. It's not spectacular, but usually not terrible either. A group of us (7) came on a Saturday night and while we expected a wait for food and such because it was a weekend night, the service was much too slow. We had to remind our server to refill our drinks when they stood empty for 10+ minutes because we didn't know where our server went. A few of us ordered the same alcoholic drinks, but they were prepared differently. I don't know what was going at the bar. The food must have taken 30-45 minutes to come out. Overall, a so-so experience.

This is the only place I get my nails done now after having been introduced to them by my sister and cousin. They do an awesome job with the gel-ish polish manicure. I've had it done at a couple of other places and they just don't pay attention to detail like Nails by Males. The guys are super nice too! They try to accommodate any style/design you ask for. I'd recommend setting up an appointment during their slower times when the ASU kids are either in class or sleeping the hangover away. ;)

I give 1 star to the super nice waiter. Other than that, let me tell you why it doesn't get any stars from me. I know you may be thinking I'm biased because I'm Vietnamese and can get home-cooked pho. However, I do eat at other Vietnamese restaurants too and this was the first time I've ever come across the worst tasting pho of my life.  What I ate: beef spring roll (goi cuon) and the meatball pho (pho bo vien).  1. The food is pricey compared to most restaurants. $7-$9 for a bowl of pho. You can find much, much better pho for $5-$6 a bowl. 2. The spring roll: the beef was dry and was more like steak meat cut up and put into it. Usually, you find spring rolls with shrimp and/or pork. 3. The pho: when it came out, I tasted just a bit of the broth because that's the most important part of pho. It was sweet! I've never in my life had pho that was pre-sweetened. It baffled me that they would even bother bringing out the hoisin sauce. That's what the hoisin sauce is for: to provide some sweetness to the soup's broth. It was like drinking sugar water. I had to ask for some fish sauce to try and balance the sweetness. They brought me a little sauce bowl for it and I dumped the whole thing into the soup - it didn't help. If anyone's tried fish sauce, they understand how salty it is. I could only eat the meatballs. I couldn't stomach the rest.  I'm shocked at how upset I am by how poor the food tasted. I'm offended that people will come into this restaurant thinking that this is representative of Vietnamese food. I'd rather go to Unphogettable, Da Vang, or Phu Thanh any day.    Please save your money, taste buds, and stomach - don't go here!
