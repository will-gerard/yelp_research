Wasn't particularly thrilled with my experience here. Went yesterday, in a rush to pick up a small bear as a gift for a friend's young daughter who was down the road at the Phoenix Children's Hospital. I expected it to be a little busy. It wasn't particularly busy, maybe about ten people all up. Fortunately, I found what I wanted quickly. First problem, there were apparently two "locations" in the store for checkouts, and one of them was very cramped up against the merchandise (enough for no more than two people to stand one behind the other). Not particularly good feng shui. I went to the other, which only had a couple of people in line. A lady looked at me curiously from behind the counter (I hadn't even reached the front, the person in front of me was still being served by someone else) and then took my stuffed bear. She looked at the tag, futzed around for about ten seconds, then leaned back and handed it to me and said "I'm just going to give this back to you..." Then she walked to the far rear area behind the counter and proceeded to ignore me. Talked to someone. Got a sheaf of papers. Walked around. Put down papers. Talked to someone else. I stood there, still in line, and watched her walk around. Then when she asked someone else in the store area if they needed help I realised that she had dropped me. I stopped her and asked her if there was anything that she needed from me and she just told me to wait in line and someone else would attend to me. Fair enough. Then another person leaned out and took my bear (again, bear in mind that I was still "waiting" for the others in front to be done) and laid it on the counter "ready" to be checked out. I waited. Then one person consulted with the other, both with relatively confused looks. I had no idea what was going on. It seemed like none of them had ever worked there before! One person actually offered to take off the tag (with price along with other instructions) then talked to the other to ask if they needed the tag. Turns out that their credit card system was down - figures - and I was asked to sign a printout despite choosing to pay as debit. They then advised me to check and call if there were any problems, which I took to mean that I could be doublecharged or something. Finally, at least twenty-five minutes later I was out of there. I haven't seen that much confusion since bingo night in the stroke ward. Won't be back.

I've been to Baby Kay's three times. The first time was probably about eight years ago, and I honestly can't remember what I ate or any details so it can essentially be ignored. The most recent visits were about a month apart and the last was today. The food is okay, but extremely overpriced and underflavored. The red beans and "rice" dish, w/andouille for an extra $1, is essentially a plate of beans with about two tablespoons' worth of white rice, plus about an ounce of their green olive coleslaw. Ok, it -was- reasonably spicy but should have been no more than about six bucks because what it really equated to was an appetizer as far as I'm concerned, and the amount of beans grossly outweighed the amount of rice. Their special today was 8 fried shrimp with dirty rice crawfish etouffee and one side. I got the coleslaw again. The amount of food, for $14, was pitiful - a half serving, essentially. And this time the flavor was just totally lacking. The full crawfish etouffee dish price is $19 which is murderously expensive and as I discovered today it just doesn't have much flavour. The dirty rice had what appeared to be minced beef in it and was light on the pepper. Even the garlic bread wasn't any better than I could have made myself with a cheap baguette from Fry's, butter and some chopped fresh garlic. I know everyone's been fapping on about authentic flavour here, but if that's what this is then I much prefer Pappadeaux. Save your money - there's no value to be had in this restaurant.  Edit 20130902: Tonight my wife made a simple meal of a packet of store-bought Tony Chachere jambalaya with some chopped up polska kielbasa sausage in it. It was delicious. Taste buds still working - check.

Went here last night, thinking it's been a while since we last went to 5 and Diner - previous experiences at other locations have been great. First impressions at this location were mighty poor - more than half of the neon signage at this place was out, including the actual logo on the front (if we didn't know what it was already we wouldn't have been able to tell). Second impression not good - only a few cars in the parking lot despite it being just after 7pm.  Went inside, were seated quickly. This is where the issues began. We were told a server would be right with us. Chose what we wanted from the menu, waited - no server. After about five minutes another couple came in and sat at a table off to our side. Within a minute THEIR server was with them. She asked if they needed a moment, they said yes, then she left. We continued to wait for initial contact with a server. Their server returned and took appetizer and drink orders. Still nothing. A guy appeared, cleaned off a table, and left. Nothing. The guy came back and started sweeping the floor. The other server attended to another table, then brought drinks and appetizer to the table that was seated after us. By this time we had been waiting over ten minutes without even giving our drink orders. The other server didn't even bother to look over at us to see if we were being attended to. Completely fucking oblivious!  We got up and left, curtly telling the front door girl why we were leaving. We got an "ohhh, sorry guys!" and then we were gone. Never returning.

This place is OPEN. We had our pics done today. Been here once before for family christmas photos, it was OK then but a little expensive, and they've gotten more expensive since then. $90+ after tax for 8 sheets, and that doesn't include a CD with the JPGs. The girl completely jacked up the first twenty or so photos - she didn't have the lighting done properly so all the best shots of our session turned out too dark! It was a digital camera - is there ANY good reason at all that we couldn't see each photo on screen a second after it was taken so we knew that it was stuffed up? No, we found out later when going through the "discard pile" on the computer with an admittedly very helpful Michelle. I'm also not particularly impressed with the photo borders they have on offer. A little too expensive for what you get, but the lack of photographic competency is inexcusable and we had to settle for second-choice pics since there's no way I was going to come back and do over again - wearing a collared shirt once a year is way enough for me thanks. Also, for some strange reason they kept calling my wife over the last week, like three or four times, leaving voicemails etc confirming our appointment and wanting to talk about "seating". My wife returned two of the calls, the second time she was like "what the hell is so important that you guys keep calling me??" The woman was like "Um, I don't really know.. you're the only guys in at that time slot and there doesn't look like there's a problem?!" Seriously, WTF. Plus, we have to wait a week for our pics. I have an SLR and a 50mm prime. Next time, I'll stage and take the photos myself and have Walgreens whip them out in an hour. CHEAPER. And I'll "own" my own photos. And *MY* props will be able to make my toddler smile.

This is another Surprise pizza joint that I haven't been to in many years. Unlike Lucky's, the last time I had gone here I don't recall disliking the pizza. Today I was thinking I wanted a pizza that wasn't from one of the "Papa Jominos" chains. I first thought of hitting up Little Sicily. But that place, stupidly, is closed on Sundays. I remembered that Deno's was around the corner, and hooray, they were open.  Went inside, and was initially blown away by how expensive the pizzas were (a jumbo thin crust with four toppings was $28 after tax - come on!), and the wife got the shits with me when I decided to order anyway. Counter girl quoted a 20-25 minute wait, but it was only about 10-15 before the pizza arrived. Very large box, containing a pizza with a wafer thin crust. I live five minutes away. The pizza was placed at a VERY slight angle on the back seat. Here's what the pizza looked like when I got it inside (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/denos-pizza-surprise?select=iJ3lhOR7kKsDfVbDgrXtLA#iJ3lhOR7kKsDfVbDgrXtLA). They've gone and done the square cut on it. Hooray for incredibly uneven slices. I wrestled a few pieces on to my paper plate, since a paper plate seemed fairly fitting for the meal. Here's a picture (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/denos-pizza-surprise?select=M8UY7SRc1Ej3Oan6pEG7Gg). Finally, I took a bite. It actually didn't taste that bad. Not nearly as horrible as Lucky's, although about 1/10th the actual amount of food. Quality over quantity, I was thinking to myself, until I saw something that guarantees I won't be returning (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/denos-pizza-surprise?select=onJJk_sYQ4L7NlU_P0iLMg). Canned f-king champignon mushrooms. AGAIN! What the hell do places like this and Lucky's think they're playing at serving tinned mushrooms on a supposedly fresh pizza? My god.  Summary? A ten buck pizza for almost thirty. I KNEW I should have gone with Ray's, or even got a cold Costco deal to heat up at home. Canned mushrooms, my codpiece. (throws pizza box in air furiously, and watches it land on the garage roof)

Okay, so this review has been a long time coming. Not sure why I haven't written one in the more than five years since I've been coming to Greek Wraps, but better late then never. I LOVE this place. I've had Greek, Turkish and various Arabic cuisines in many cities and several countries, and the stuff they serve here is right up there with the most flavorful I've ever had.  Primarily, the fact that they make their own bread fresh to order is what gets me salivating when it's coming close to lunchtime. They have 7" pitas or thinner 10" wraps. I get the latter. They're delicious. I'll either get a chicken kabob or shawarma wrap, typically with a side of falafels and a side of dolmas (vine/grape leaves). Their vine leaves are the cold vegetarian versions; none of that disgusting hot stuff with pine nuts and meat. Falafels are excellent - they don't taste store-bought and sludgy but have great flavour with a very nice, subtle peppery aftertaste. The shawarma is fantastic - marinated enough to give it a delicious zing. Me eating a wrap is like putting a piece of paper in a shredder - I absolutely decimate the thing nonstop from start to finish and have to watch out that I don't chew my own fingers off towards the end. I've had baklava once or twice from here, it's not too bad either. And thank god they don't serve ridiculous Chicago-style hotdogs here. Last I checked, Chicago wasn't in Greece.  Greek Wraps has always been extremely popular, especially at lunchtime, and it was always way overcrowded. The "Jersey Shore" (cracked me up) dudes prepping the food work pretty furiously but still it takes quite a while to get your meal, sometimes 10-15 minutes or longer. Toward the end of last year they did a MUCH-needed renovation and pretty much doubled the interior space - I remember walking in and then doing a doubletake since I didn't recognize any of it. Even with the added space it's still almost always full up at midday. Great prices, the absolute best Mediterranean take-out on the west side (I like Pita Jungle equally, but that's a different range/style of foods) and well deserving of your cashola. For dessert, assuming you have room (typically unlikely), you got your choice of a Jamba Juice or a Juju Berri in the same strip, or else walk across the carpark to Cost Plus World Market and pick up a coupla import chocolates like Milka Nussini or Cadbury Flake. Mmm.  Edit 20110615: BLEAH!! T Greek Wraps now stocks the infamous Abali "yoghurt soda" which I first tried at Haji Baba's down in Tempe. Disgusting - BUT!! I was super excited to see it and actually bought a bottle to drink. Do not ask me why. I grimace every time I take a swallow of it, but maybe I like it because of the Warhead effect - some sort of mild endorphin rush you get from challenging your taste buds to something they aren't thrilled with. Anyway, add another imaginary star to my review just for this stuff alone. See my pic. http://j.mp/jIYTCK

Headed downtown to the soon-to-be-new-office with the boss today and had lunch here - he's lived in Phx for decades and recommended this place (although he hadn't been there in many years). I got a Super Sicilian. Absolutely delicious - the sesame bread looked like it would be hard/crunchy but it was soft and tasty. If I had to offer up any criticisms it would be 1) the fact that it inexplicably took something like 10 mins to make our sandwich - it just looked like it had been toasted, nothing else I could think of should have made it take that long, and 2) the sandwich was too small *8-) My mistake, of course. I got a whole, and could easily have downed two of those. Taste wise it's equivalent IMO to the "all-American grinder" at Uncle Sam's, except with the latter you can also get jalapenos. Will definitely return here once our office shifts downtown, but next time I'll get a sub and a half, methinks!  PS: Parking? The boss just parked his Ram 2500HD and toy trailer around the corner on the street in front of someone's house. No problem and no parking meters. (shrug)

Just had lunch here. Another great experience - you pretty much can't go wrong at Claim Jumper. I'm not a major salad buff by any stretch of the imagination, but I didn't want to fill up on anything so I went for one of their salads and man was I glad I did. I got the goat cheese and beet salad - walnuts, beets, mixed dark greens, papaya, cherry tomatoes in a citrus sauce with goat cheese. The cheese pretty much amounted to a tiny bit of sprinkles on top of the salad, but that didn't matter because it pretty much became my favourite salad of all time today after only having it once. Highest praise I can give to a dish basically. The Yelp app failed to lock my location so I couldn't do a checkin; apart from that, a five star visit.  No idea why the Yelp info shows this place as being in Scottsdale though. It's N Phoenix, at the 101 and I-17. Submitted biz change to have this corrected. (I was wondering why the CJ's didn't show up on my Yelp app on the cellphone for checkin; now I know..)

Went here for lunch today. I've been a couple of times and each time I've been impressed. It's a tiny, dingy stripmall place with a drink fountain on one side, couple of bench seats, couple of tables, and a counter up the back. They've got the usual huge menu - all sorts of chicken, pork and beef dishes. Doesn't sound like much, but it gets four stars based on the following. It's excellent value, it's fresh, tasty and filling food, and you don't wait more than five minutes for it to be prepared. As we all know, regular Chinese take-away isn't terribly spectacular at the best of times, but this place has bowls, combos and dinner specials for extremely reasonable prices, and you get a LOT of food. Today, for example, I got the lunch combo for take-out. Were I to have stayed, it would have been unlimited soda refills (of course). The meal included the mongolian chicken, rice fried in soy sauce, an eggroll, two small containers of sauce, a fortune cookie, two sachets of soy sauce, fork, napkins and they even threw piece of cardboard at the bottom of the take-out bag so the whole shebang wouldn't tilt and spill while being carried.  Big deal, you say? It was $5.75. Yeah, it IS a big deal to me. The rice was piping hot and fresh out of the wok, the rest of the meal was delicious, I've been several times and I haven't gotten food poisoning (UNLIKE several Mexican crapholes scattered around town), and you're stuffed for under six bucks. Yeah, it wasn't haute cuisine. Yeah, I wasn't eating duck sphincter with bat cock pate and an olive tapenade by candlelight at some ridiculous elite event. But it was delicious, substantial, and more than enough to keep me coming back.

I had been planning to visit this place for a while now, ever since it was recommended by Iain B several months back after my thoroughly disappointing experience at Chicago Gyros. I took the opportunity to have lunch here last Friday since the wife had an appointment at a tattoo place just around the corner, forcing us to drive all the way from Surprise. I was like "Holy sh1t, Haji Babas is supposed to be around here somewhere" while Google Mapping the tat shop location.  Now, I'm no stranger to dinge. I grew up in an "old" city, and Sydney and outlying suburbs has its fair share of dingy places, perhaps topped by Gould's Book Arcade in Newtown. First impression of Haji Babas is that it's a dingy, hole in the wall establishment. So far, so good right? Basically it's divided up into a mini ethnic supermarket featuring stuff like Cock Cola (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA?select=1dl1l6baJJdY7q53V-V7uw) and Patak's, one of my favourite Indian marinade and grill sauce brands. Ibbida ibbida WHAT? Indian in an Arabic grocery? Yep, but that's not where the Indian surprises end - stay tuned! The other section has a selection of cheap tables and chairs, the likes of which made even the decor at Chino Bandido's look opulent by comparison. Still, I was quite comfortable with it all. We sat down and had a look at the menu. Lots of familiar stuff, so in order to make a good comparison with other similar places I've eaten at, I ordered the hummus dip and vegetarian platter.  First thing that struck me was that the initial babaghannoush plate was VERY good. Nothing beats the hummus/bbg from my home town's "Istanbul on King", but I'm going to say that this was probably the second best I've had - high praise from me - with lots of oil on top. The vegetarian platter was also quite good. It came with a side of raita, which was a little odd. No, it wasn't tzatziki. Although perhaps it was raitziki, or tzaita. The wife took one dip of it and proceeded to exclaim that it was the best raita she had ever had. I'd probably say that's true - it was just the right consistency, and had unusually large pieces of dill pickle in it. No, not cucumber. I did my cooldown test with the pita, it didn't get leathery (unlike Chicago Gyros') so another thumbs up there. I have two minor complaints, though. The dolmas were hot. I HATE hot dolmas, I don't know who invented the idea but all I've ever eaten for three decades in Oz has been the cold stuff. Never even KNEW they came in a heated variety until I arrived stateside. Perhaps the cold ones are an option, who knows. I'll find out next time I'm here. Because I'm definitely coming back. Last complaint, the falafels. They weren't as good as the Greek Wraps ones, and actually fairly salty. Strangely enough, my plate came with a small side of hummus, but it was different to what I'm used to - it had a yellowish tinge to it whereas typically it's a kind of off-white (added pinch of turmeric or saffron?) and the combo of falafels with it was a little too salty for my taste. Not enough to knock off a star though.  The wife had a chicken shishkabob with a giant amount of rice and salad - so much that she was stuffed and her plate didn't even look a quarter empty. Excellent value for money. I had a mouthful of her rice and would give it my vote for the most properly-cooked, fluffy basmati I've had in a LONG time. We did a once-through in the grocery area before we left and picked up some Patak marinades. And I couldn't leave without a piece of cashew baklava. Good, not the best I've had but pretty good. They have a couple of kid's chocolates up the front, the kid enjoyed that in the car despite getting half of it on his pants and the seat.  The prices are incredibly reasonable. I was seeing some things for three, four dollars. If it weren't for the fact that this place is almost 50 miles from where I live I'd eat here every few days. Why can't they open something like this in Surprise? We don't even have an INDIAN restaurant closer than eighteen or so miles away. You CenPho and Tempe locals should consider yourselves d4mn lucky.  Big thumbs up for Haji Babas. If the owners are reading this, set up another location in the west valley for pete's sake! I need to go back here and get a handle on the dips and tastes and stuff because evidently these guys are giving their own little spin to middle eastern cuisine, at least as far as my experience goes. If I'm still learning, that's a good thing. Next time I'm going to see what the difference is between their "pita" and their "hand-made pita". It's just unfortunate that it's going to be a very rare treat for me due to distance.

I've eaten at the 19th and Greenway (original) location for years. Loved their Pollo Diablo and jerk-fried rice. However, several months ago I ordered a half dozen of their snickerdoodle cookies and both my wife and I got severe food poisoning from them which knocked us out for the entire weekend. I give them two stars because of the fact that they're unique and I enjoyed their food for a long time with no problems, but places like this only get one chance with me and I will never eat there again. In addition, they raised their prices to over $10 per combo plate when you get a drink, and that's on the pricey side for what you get. Not worth any more than about $6. Summary - this place is off the table for me, but if you're willing to risk food poisoning and you like swiftly-prepared spicy food, give it a shot. Guy Fieri seemed to like it (it was reviewed on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives not too long ago). Definitely a dive IMO - and I second a previous reviewer's comment - "are we in a cafeteria?"

Claim Jumper continues to be my all-round favourite restaurant in the US. First time I ate at one in California I was blown away by the portion size (so big that they were serving apples on the plates) and also by the taste of the food. Their prime rib is absolutely delicious, and second favourite of mine is the rotisserie chicken - especially with their barbecue sauce. In fact, if you get any steak there, get that BBQ sauce and slather it on - it's wonderful.  Varied menu, giant portions, reasonable price, consistently excellent service, giant tables available (they're usually spacious as hell inside), lunchtime portions, and the biggest desserts I've ever seen in my life. No exaggeration, the "I Declair" custard eclair is literally more than enough for four people and about the size of a loaf of bread. And the amount of drinks they have almost defies belief, although I'm not a mega-alcoholic I find myself continually shaking my head every time I look at their drink list.  They do call-ahead seating as well. For most locations, including this one, it's probably a good idea to take advantage of that as Claim Jumpers are often packed on Fridays and Saturdays.  Meal highlights: Prime Rib, Nachos (one serving is enough for FOUR people), Rotisserie Chicken and possibly the most delicious appetizer on the planet, Cheese Potatocakes.  Really, this place just craps on everywhere else. If I was ever on death row, I'd have my last meal ordered from this restaurant hands down. I'd give them ten stars if I could.

Only been here once, and once was enough. The place is absolutely crap. Not that I typically care about decor, but it was dingy as hell inside - in fact, your bog standard Denny's is like a Taj Mahal by comparison.  As others have commented, there was some ethnic fair-skinned girl on duty when we went. I know she was Ukrainian because the couple behind us picked up on the accent (which was almost too thick to understand) and asked her. Not exactly authentic, but then again that's something else I'm not typically concerned with.  What I am concerned with, however, is food quality - in particular places that skimp on stuff. I got a saag dish - can't remember what it was, probably beef or aloo - and it was completely drowned in the saag (pureed spinach). Wife got the butter chicken, same thing - 80% sauce, 20% meat. And the taste was just a-ight, nothing special at all which made it even more annoying. I could have cooked the same thing at home for a tenth the price.  During the course of the meal, I noticed something which looked like a black beetle with its innards spilling out. I've seen plenty of cardamom seeds in my time, but the ones I'm used to are khaki-ish-greenish in colour and a lot smaller than this was. I called Ms Ukraine over and asked her what it was. She - get this - gave me a scared expression and said in her halting English "I.. not know! don't eat it!!" then scurried off. Don't eat it?! I had a sniff of the seed and it was definitely a cardamom - evidently a Giant Black North American Cardamom. Frankly, looking at the place I wouldn't have been surprised if it -was- a beetle.  Never going back. I wouldn't have even if the server HADN'T have advised me not to eat the food. Best Indian on the west side remains Tandoori Times II on NE cnr 57th and W Bell, and even that's a far cry from what I've had in Sydney and San Fran. I second Mr K.'s observation - avoid this place.

God, after all the burritos, tortitos, empanodos, mosquitos and other disgusting mex food in Phoenix, this place was a breath of fresh air - especially since it's so close by to where I live. I've never really had Polish food before and the food here is hearty and delicious. I've eaten here a number of times, and mainly used to get their giant Polish King's Feast (cabbage roll, kielbasa, 3x pierogies, "hunter's stew" and bread), but now my favourite is the kiszka (blood sausage). No, trust me, it's delicious! Their red cabbage is absolutely awesome, and actually kind of "sweet"-tasting.  Food prepared promptly, a bit pricey but not over the top (worth it for the flavours). Place is kind of a hole in the wall but there's a lot of stuff in here. You can dine-in (about six or seven tables all up) or take out, and they have a deli counter with a billion Polish meats/sausages, plus some Polish grog (bizarre, large, ornate bottles) and Okocim beer, chocolates like "rum kocke" (a condition I've suffered from on occasion) etc. Used to be run by a dude and his wife, but apparently Grandpa now works there and Grandpa don't understand English too well. I still managed to sign-language my order to him and the blood sausage was just as delicious as ever.  Oldies cram into this place in the evenings so get there early (er, wait a minute - on second thought, get there after 6:30p and they'll probably all be gone) or just do the take-out thing. If you've never eaten here and you're in the area, you really need to try it. I'd go for the cabbage roll with creamy tomato sauce (per Melissa H's recommendation), and if there's two of you get their potato pancakes with apple sauce. Way too much potato for one person but delightful at least for the first several dozen bites.  Then get the kiszka with mash potato and red cabbage on your next visit. This dish has made it to the top ten fave meals I've ever had in Arizona. Doesn't taste like blood, I promise.  Then try the sandwiches.. you almost need a flip-top head to take a bite out of them, they're piled pretty high. They have regular stuff there, ham etc, and also headcheese.. yummo. Just a great little place to have dinner at, despite being a bit cramped and the newspapers being all in Polish. Sorry, I don't speak or read shish-nish.  Edit: One last thing I forgot to mention. This place has some real crappy business hours. Only open until 6pm on some days, 8pm on others. Ridiculous. AND, there have been times when I've gotten there at 7:45pm on an 8pm night, only to find the place already closed up - I looked in the window and spotted the staff standing at the register gloating and chuckling like Gollum at the day's takings. Other times, they've had a sign up "closed for 2 weeks for spring vacation" - what the? It appears they don't mind closing up shop on a whim so the other thing to be aware of is that if you go, don't be surprised if they're closed because one of the staff ran out of toothpaste or broke a fingernail.. (mutters under breath)

Time for a brief update. This place has undergone some major renovation recently. They kicked out the army signup center next door, busted down the wall and totally redid the interior. It's now got twice as many tables, a mini dance floor (looks to be probably a max of five people on the floor at any one time before you start bumping and grinding), and a small bar with about three bar stools on the far side. Plus, thankfully no sign of Grandpa - instead, the original guy, a new (young) guy and a new chick were on duty. Kiszka was the same, there's just a little more breathing room inside now. And less Polish newspapers (that I could see, anyway). They have a grand opening soon, where I'm sure beer will flow freely and they'll play that godawful polka music at full blast. Forgot to mention that the first time round.. it's that hilarious "drunken" music that is perfect for drinking games and for swinging your beer stein to. Osh posh, pish a posh, shish a nish a loo.. BLOOAAARGGHH

Okay, I'm absolutely, positively, well and truly DONE with this place. Last night (Wednesday) we had arranged with friends to meet there for dinner at 6:45pm. When we got there (6:45pm) there was a CLOSED sign in the window -- AGAIN! I've mentioned the ridiculous business hours before - such as taking Sunday off to celebrate the fact that it comes after Saturday etc. It seems that they have all new business hours, and what I read has permanently lost them four customers.  Closed Monday and Tuesday (?!) Wednesday open 11am-3pm (!?) Thursday open 11am-8pm. That's basically as far as I bothered to read.  This restaurant can go to hell - that's the third time I've arrived at a completely appropriate time of the evening only to have the place inexplicably closed.  I don't care about the recent renovations and frankly there are way too many other delicious places around to be bothered severely adjusting schedules and timing to get into this place during the three or four hours a week that they could be BOTHERED to open. Screw them.  EDIT 20120925: Apparently they've changed the name of this place to "Eddie's European Bistro". A lot of time has passed since I got the sh1ts with them; I MAY decide to return and see if anything's improved. If they're closed once more that'll be IT though.

You're kidding. This place has been open for months and months and I'm the first to review? Ok. I've had Papa Murphy's back when I was living in Washington state, and I thought it was an excellent idea at the time. Take-and-bake pizza hasn't really hit Arizona, but there needs to be more of these stores. It's sort of like the pizza version of Subway. You order the size, crust type and type of pizza that you're after and then your pizza is constructed before your eyes. The dough is flattened out, white or red sauce applied, cheese and toppings next (you can ask for more or less of each), and then finally the pizza is placed on a special tray which can be put directly into the oven. They wrap it with industrial-size Saran and you're good to go. Total construction time is typically ten minutes, but there's often a queue at the Surprise location.  They have a new pizza flavour which is my absolute favourite at the moment - the Chicken/Bacon/Artichoke pizza. I just polished off the last slice of it for lunch today. It tastes a little better when it's fresh, but reheated it was still great. They have a decent variety of pizzas and crust types, ranging from the "dee-lite" crust which is about 1/32 of an inch thick, right through to their thick and stuffed crust. Regular pizzas typically take 12-18 mins at 425 deg. Longer for their stuffed crust ones. You can cook immediately when you get home or throw in the freezer for later.  The prices are great as well. I bought a family size thick crust CBA pizza for $14.99 - enough for three people with a couple of slices left over. I can usually pack it away, but three slices took me down to Chinatown last night. They have huge pizzas here - the stuffed crust supreme ones could probably satisfy the biggest of appetites with just 2-3 slices. Way cheaper than delivery and fresher. They also have a couple of other sundry items such as containers of salad and even cookie dough! You can call ahead too - when you walk in you're welcomed and asked whether you're there to pick up or place an order.  If I had to pick something that ain't great about the place, it would have to be the lack of seats for waiting. There's just a single lame Ikea-style particle-board bench with a few magazine on it. When there's a lot of people you've got no choice but to lean against the wall since the bench probably holds 2.5 people. And you could be waiting up to 30 mins or more in peak times. They should throw about ten cheap chairs against the wall. Anyway, doesn't detract from the quality of the product.  Definitely worth trying!

Well, I just had dinner from this place and felt I had to write about it immediately. This is the second time I've had Rosati's. Last time I wasn't impressed at all. Previously I had their "double dough" pizza, which is "twice as thick" as the thin'n'crispy dough. Whatever. It wasn't great the first time. However the father-in-law has had some pizzas from the Anthem location and said he really liked it. Tonight we were looking for something quick to eat and I suggested one of the various pizza places around Surprise. Anyway, we decided to give it another chance. I went and got a take-out order of their pan-style "classic combo".  The second time round, they failed miserably. I love pan pizzas, not the cracker-crust crap. The box was pretty heavy which was a good thing. I brought it home and revealed the contents, with the wife watching eagerly (it was after 9pm). The first thing that registered was a little confusion. Granted, the pizza was very thick, but it looked like someone had just poured a can of freakin peeled tomatos over the top of the pizza and then half-heartedly dusted some parmesan cheese on it. What the? I've never seen anything like it. The tomato base and chunks were on the TOP of the cooked cheese and other ingredients! Well, whatever, I figured that was probably the Sicilian way or something. Next up, both of us had to get a teflon spatula to pick up the pieces since the whole top of the pizza was soggy. The dough was still firm underneath, so after wrestling with the ultra-stringy mozzarella we busted out the TV trays and commenced dining.  It tasted okay. We used knives and forks. I tend to do this rather than wind up with a hand that looks like I've just helped a cow give birth. But after the ten mins or so I spent carving my way through the morass of toppings, my third and final slice was soggy as hell - by that time the toppings had finally seeped down to the bottom of the dough. I couldn't get through it. By the time I was done, I'm not even kidding, my plate looked like what I had left in the bottom of a toilet in Portland last year when I was violently ill after having one of those churrascarria Brazilian meat shower meals. Just red muck, meat pieces and a combination of crisp and soggy pan dough. Please see the photo (camphone) I'll attach showing the pizza after we'd taken a few slices of it.  I'll never go back. A complete waste of money. However, it wasn't the WORST pizza I've ever had (that honour belongs to Pizza Pizzazz in Sydney), and they MIGHT have gotten two stars if they'd remembered that 1) their pizza ingredient list on the website DIDN'T include canned tomatoes and 2) tomato base is laid on the dough FIRST before the rest of the toppings. So yeah, crossing another one off my list. Definitely the "Mozilla Firefox" of pizza joints: second rate, badly-prepared and something to be avoided by all but the terminally clueless.

Today I visited JT Gyros for the second time and decided to write a review for it. I completely agree with a previous reviewer with the place warranting about 2.75 stars. Maybe 2.5. It's not that great. Actually, now that I think about it they're getting a 2 (folds arms and nods).  Yesterday I got the vegetarian plate to go. I'm a big fan of this style of cuisine, with my favourite being Greek Wraps on Bell Rd. I love dolmas, falafels, shawarma, kibbe, tzatziki, hummus, baklava.. you name it I drool over it. And I've had lots of veggo plates from mediterranean places before, decorated with all sorts of dandy unique items like pickled turnips etc. I was quite disappointed with the meal from JT's. To start with, it certainly LOOKED appetizing. All the pieces of the puzzle were there; hummus centrally punctuated with kalamata olives, a nice arrangement of dolmas and falafel (hockey-puck shaped on a bed of lettuce, as opposed to the more traditional shape which always reminds me of the haystacks in Monet's "End of Summer, Morning") on a bed of lettuce, surrounded by tomato and cucumber. That's almost where the attractiveness ended, I'm afraid.  From best to worst: the hummus was great, very tasty although they went a little too heavy with the accompanying oil and the topcoat of paprika; the falafels were just okay (didn't taste near as flavorful as the fresh stuff from Greek Wraps - Ryan C got it spot on with the observation that it tasted like out-of-a-box mix); the dolmas were WARMED (I cannot STAND the taste of warm dolmas, especially the ones with meat in them - these didn't have meat, of course) - dolmas MUST be served cold as far as I'm concerned, although I understand that this is very much a personal preference; the lettuce had turned wet and soggy from the dolma juice, the pita bread was sub-par and was almost as tough as shoe leather when it cooled down slightly (I had to growl and wrestle with it to rip off a chunk like a feral animal); and finally.. oh my god, the so-called "tzatziki" was absolutely ~disgusting~. It was actually closer to coconut cream than anything else, except less flavorful. OK, imagine mixing 1 part flour with 10 parts skim milk. Or a container of raw Church's Chicken regular batter mix. That's what this stuff was.  I paid almost ten bucks for a meal that left me highly dissatisfied in flavor. I polished the entire thing off apart from the not-even-close-to-tzatziki sauce, which indicated that it wasn't a complete turnoff, but still. Seriously, if my meal didn't have good hummus that I was able to just drown the flavor of the dolmas in I'd be mildly pissed. Won't be coming back. It's entirely worth the trip further down the road to Greek Wraps. Did I mention Greek Wraps yet? That name again: Greek Wraps. As for JT's, it gets this week's steaming dog's egg award. (claps hands twice) (light turns off)

Pretty standard Subway, clean and reasonably efficient staff. What sets this one apart from about ten other ones I've eaten from Surprise all the way through to this area is that they opted to stock the veggie patties. NONE of the other Subways I've tried have these. Which opens up two new items on their menu - the Veggie Patty sub and the Veggie Max salad. I just posted a pic of the latter. I'm quite a fan of the veggie patties, although they're apparently fairly high in sodium. The veggie max salad is just the right size to take the edge off your hunger at lunch and see you through to a 3pm linner. Not many people know about the veggie patty, often the person behind me will look at my sandwich being made and ask me "what sort of meat is that?" *8-)  Since I'm not a vegetarian, one day I might try the veggie patty with a coupla slices of meat like ham maybe. Might taste pretty good, especially with the spicy buffalo sauce. Anyway. Five stars.

This is my favourite Chinese take-away in the area. I'm not particularly fussy when it comes to Chinese food - it doesn't take a great deal of skill to make and typically it all tastes the same to me, so I'm basing this review on value for money. You get a LOT of food for your buck here. I'll usually get two dishes and a fried rice and for about $20 I'll walk out with about three pounds of food. They pack the fried rice so tightly into a large container that you almost need a shoehorn to get it out later. Some dishes are quite tasty - my favourite is the pork with black mushroom and snow peas.  Some dishes, however, aren't that great. An order of Mongolian Pork would have been better termed "Mongolian Onion" - 1 part pork to ten of green and regular onions and sauce. And as for the Yui Shan chicken, eurgh. Weakly spiced, sludgy, and sweet as molasses - chicken, zucchini, carrot and mushroom. Won't get that one again.  Most of the time you'll get your order in 10 min or less, but I've been there when it's been busy and then they kinda buckle and I was waiting over 30 mins. Wasn't a problem that night, but if it becomes a habit.. (shrug)  Anyway, better than Big Buddha (Greenway and 303) - way too pricey with way too few items on the menu -  and a tiny bit better than Golden Wei (although GW has a larger seating area). Chen&Wok is a tiny place, about maybe 6-7 Costco tables, so it's better to order take-out than sit in there under their bright lights and have dinner while watching Andrew Zimmern eat frog's pizzles on their crapburger 10" telly..

Not a bad place at all. It's also reasonably new. Up until a couple of months ago my office was a quarter mile from this place. I'd passed the sign a couple of times and gave it a shot one evening. Prior to trying TT2, I'd been a regular at Maharaja's Palace (pretty much on the diagonally opposite [SW] corner of 57th Ave), and if you like you can read my review of the latter to see why I won't eat there anymore.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food at TT2. It's a little more expensive but the food appears to be of higher quality. Basically the naan is the freshest/tastiest I've had in the US. Unfortunately they're light on beef dishes (probably because the moo cow is held in higher regard than people are back in India?) and I missed things like beef saag and vindaloo, but everything else is real good. They have "chaat" on the weekends - kinda like the Indian equivalent of Spanish tapas? - but there are several items on this particular menu that aren't available during the week and that's a bit strange.  Lunch specials are pretty good. There's a different main dish each day and they serve quite an acceptable portion of rice, that dish, salad and raita. Unfortunately most of the guys in my office are Phoenix-born and for some reason they consider Indian food to be anathema (I've literally gotten laughed at when I proposed this place once as a lunch destination) and thus I typically don't have too many lunch partners when I've eaten here. Then again these are the same guys who'll eat the most wretched Mexican slop I've ever gagged on in my life.. day after day, over and over and over.. but I digress..  One black mark against this place, they aren't open on Mondays. It's Monday today and I'd kill for some Indian for dinner so that totally sucks. Anywhere that isn't open 7 days a week really needs to reevaluate. Fortunately I can cook the stuff at home - that's when I have three hours to spare..  Summary: It's far from the best Indian restaurant that I've eaten at, but it's the best in Phoenix that I've found (admittedly, I haven't tried anything on the east side YET.. *8-)

Erm, this place is closed or out of business? I went there yesterday about midday. All I saw inside was a painter's bucket and a couple of office desks. Their website says they're "Now Open!" but unless they've moved (there was no sign indicating this) the place doesn't exist.

'Bout time I wrote a review of this place, being as I'm here every few days. Surprisingly, it's my kid that asks to go eat here after school each day. His name for it is "The Cookie Place". He loves their PBJ sandwich along with the cookie (of course) and squeeze yoghurt included in the kids meal. I dither between two meals - either the ham and swiss sandwich with a small paradise pasta salad, or else one of their Fuji Apple Chicken salads which are freakin' delicious. With the sandwich I always ask for extra dijon vinagrette - the Fuji salad's special apple-flavoured dressing is almost worth buying a separate bottle of.  There's really not much else to be said about Paradise Bakery. The staff are reasonably familiar with me and if you have one of their loyalty cards, every 10th or 12th meal is free. Definitely works for regulars like us. They've got free wifi at the location and it's amazing how many people bring their laptops in - like Starbucks. All I do is check in with Yelp. And hey, I'm the Duke (at time of writing). Woo hoo. If only that actually MEANT something.  Consistent food, quick service, friendly, the place is clean, it's local to me, and every member of my family likes it. Makes it a five star establishment far as I'm concerned.

The quality vs value of this place has completely plummetted in recent times and I had a very disappointing visit a few weeks ago. I had met a couple of friends for lunch who had never been here before. Told them that it was one of the best soul food places I've ever been to, which at time of stating had been quite true. I've been coming here for about seven or eight years and I remember when the food used to cost $8.80 per plate - AND after your meal someone was always walking around offering the dessert of the day to everyone. Quaint and tasty and decently priced. Now, everything is almost double that, over $14 per plate. And the flavours have gone downhill. I told these guys the cornbread at Mrs White's was all-world. Out comes stale shitty cornbread that I guarantee was made the previous day - we got there at just after 11am so I KNOW it wasn't fresh. One of my friends asked for mac and cheese, they didn't have it. Also didn't have red beans and rice, which is what I normally order. Um, ok. I asked for smothered chicken. The other two asked for fried chicken. Out come three plates of fried chicken. I was too hungry to care. Then the guy comes out and says they DO have mac and cheese. Whatever. Collard greens aren't flavourful at all - almost like something steamed out of a Green Giant freezer pack. Fried chicken was okay, but not anything better than Church's and three times the price. And nobody offered any dessert, not that we would have had it anyway.  The bill for all three of us came to $48!! For basically something I could have cobbled together myself and I'm not even kidding. Kraft mac and cheese would have been tastier. Fried chicken takes a little while but isn't rocket science. Collard greens are a twenty-five cent side, and I almost broke my tooth on the cornbread. This place went from a treat to a disaster in one horrible visit. Won't be back unless and until they literally halve their prices and go back to the quality hole-in-the-wall they used to be. At least they accept credit cards now - only took them a half century to figure that out. And to top it off, their website is just as jacked up as their prices. 2 stars.

Oh. My. God. I've had a LOT of ice-cream and a decent whack of gelato and frozen custard in my time, but this place is the bickety mc-freakin'-BOMB. Their custard is like crack cocaine and I told the owner (no idea what his name is, but my wife and I refer to him as "John Ritter") that when I was in there not too long ago. Right after I said "Hey, long time no see!" to him since I'd been in the day before as well.  Anyway, they've got a lot of flavours here but I typically stick to old faithful. I've never ever had a better vanilla malt. Hands down this place is the ultimate dessert - if you eat ANYWHERE on Bell Road west of Grand - Red Lobster, Chilis, El Paso, wherever - don't get dessert - save room, drive to Ritters and eat some of their custard instead.  Plus, kudos to the chickie behind the counter for making the closest guess to date of where my accent originates from. She guessed New Zealand, a damn sight closer than the "Britain" that everyone else guesses. But I digress. First-timers, all I can say is do NOT consume anything at Ritters or you WILL become addicted.

It's a damn sad day in Surprise when a place like this closes. Really liked the owner dude and the frozen custard was the best I've tasted. Culvers isn't anywhere near the quality of what Ritters provided. Damn it.

closed!!!!!!  EDIT: 20100716: Wait a minute. This place is still open! I think they must have closed for some renovations - went there today and it's definitely open for business with buffet and everything. Didn't look like it was renovated either. Please ignore my previous indication of it being closed. Still one of the better buffet on the west side, too. Looks like they got a new website..

Had lunch here with my wife today. It's the second time I've been and her first. After my first visit it rocketed into my top five favourite restaurants of all time. They have some top notch food, and the best thing is that it's such a deliciously welcome change from the bottom-feeder's Mexican crap that you see all over Phoenix. The menu is varied and I think I eventually will want to try everything. Appetizers include fried alligator and frog's legs. The main I had today was their Mardi Gras Pasta, which is linguini with tomato, thin-sliced garlic, andouille sausage, crawfish meat, onion and delicious shrimp topped with a really nice creamy sauce. Absolutely delicious. The wife had mahi-mahi with an even NICER sauce, and dirty rice on the side. Although a tiny bit on the pricy side it's definitely worth coming back to. Large open seating (outdoor seating also available), dimly lit, old-style jazz, a large full-service bar and a very quaint outside waiting area with water feature, giant fans etc. The service was also great and both times I've been, the waiters have been very helpful (the first guy told me that if I got the large serving of alligator, to try it 'half-blackened' - a great tip which allowed me to taste both 'styles' of the appetizer). They also have things I've not heard of before like etoufee and opelousas. If my dad didn't live over seven thousand miles away I'd take him here in an instant - he'd absolutely love the place. You will too.  Oh yeah, they have creme brulee (with fresh fruit) and sweet potato pecan pie, amongst other things, for dessert. We had the latter - yum.

Response to Rob C: I wasn't offered anything from any other restaurant. You got this review because I've eaten WAY better Greek than what you serve. You just trashed any chance you had of repeat business from me too, as I was -planning- to come back and try some more meat-oriented stuff as has been suggested. Incidentally, I could have sworn I wrote a review of Greek Wraps already, but looking through all the reviews (even the filtered ones) it seems I haven't. They obviously didn't pay me enough eh? (snort)

This place is a VAST distance from my house. Fortunately, I was in the area on business, met the wife and went here for lunch based on the positive Yelp reviews and the fact that she'd been here before and really liked it. GOD I'm glad I did. The first thing that hit me was the smell as we walked in - amazing. I've been to a lot of Indian buffets; this one SMELLED the best. So far, so good. Found our table but as usual with any given buffet, arse didn't hit the chair before I was schlopping food onto my plate. Dhal, channa, chicken curry, aloo gobhi, chicken tikka masala (out when I was at the buffet, but they filled it up pretty quick after), meat and pea samosas, potato pakoras, and a giant laundry-basket-sized rice cooker to scoop from. Flung a few ribbons of raita Jackson Pollock-like (or Ron Jeremy-like, depending on your aesthetic sensibilities) across the heaped plate and back to the table to dine. Out came some garlic naan (better than regular naan!) which was thin and fresh. Making good on the promise of the initial smell, the food was VERY flavorful. Best buffet I've been to. The chicken curry was actually SPICY, not dumbed down. Why the hell does this place have to be ~40 miles from my house? One thing's for sure, I'll be back. Maybe not for a while, but still - Indian Paradise rocketed to #1 on my Indian restaurant list after the first mouthful and I'm pretty sure the same will be the case for any Indian food aficionado that tries it. Word of warning - it may be too much of a punch in the mouth for newcomers to the cuisine - if that's you, I suggest getting your feet wet at Bombay Spice (Tatum and Shea) first before trying this joint. Came out with my gut looking like an alien was going to bust out of it and my tastebuds feeling as though they'd gone around the LHC a few billion times. Hands down five out of five.

Not a bad little place. Claims to be a gourmet "takeout" but there are a few tables inside and out that you can sit at, despite the fact that the entire shop is roughly the size of my master bedroom's crapper. I got their menu and will scan and post it when I get around to it. Since I was the designated food bringer-homer, I ordered a lamb panini for myself and a flank steak panini for my wife, along with an order of blueberry bread pudding and mille feuille, which the lady informed me meant "a thousand layers", confirming what I already knew from high-school French. The paninis came in boxes which also contained a reasonably boring salad spruced up with a fairly tasty balsamic dressing and candied pecans - the first time I believe I've ever had those. They added a little something that improved the taste further.  The panini was delicious; the lamb part of it, anyway. It's real hard to get good lamb in this city, especially lamb that tasted this good. I'm dead sick of typical lamb dishes in the US where everyone seems to think that you cannot prepare lamb without rosemary (==FALSE). The sweet onions with it were perfect. I didn't like the crusty bread that it was on - maybe that's the standard for a panini but I'd have preferred something that didn't rip the roof of my mouth wide open.  Two minor issues with this place. Firstly, it's too expensive. The paninis at $10 each are right at the upper limit of what I'd pay for what I got. Other dishes, like the fish and chips, are exorbitantly priced - would you pay $16 for F&C? There's another steak dish they have for $23 which is probably the filet with carrot butter (the menu's downstairs or I'd check again) - get serious, this place is a tiny hole in the wall and I'd expect nothing over $12, even if the chef DID have a French accent. And even if they DO mix carrots with butter.  Second thing. That kid that blows raspberries and mutters "chocolate" into her dad's armpit or whatever was there again. This time Grandpa brought her in. She ran around for a bit, then she sat down and her mum (behind the counter) brought her out some hummus to eat (?!), all the time giggling about how the little girl was wearing her "pirate shoes" or something. Okay. This is a take-out shop, not Disneyland. If I want family-style hijinks I'll go to Chucky Cheese, not what I thought was a gourmet French place. Kiddy stay home when mummy and daddy worky; customer eat and leave happy. I'm not one of those people that smiles beatifically when young kids caper about and drool over candy. Unless it's my kid. You can imagine what Halloween is like at my house. Fortunately I only spent a short time in there while waiting for my food to be prepared.  Four stars this time purely on the strength of the lamb panini and the fact that the counter gal was nice enough to give me a cold glass of water while I waited. The desserts are still in my fridge from when I went there yesterday and I'll probably eat one or both of them tomorrow, since we already had an early dessert from Ritters this afternoon. *8-) I don't think they'll change my rating either way, though.

The first time we tried Lucky's was maybe six years ago. I didn't like it then. Hard to remember what we ordered, perhaps a Sicilian style, but either the crust or sauce or something else turned us off and we decided not to go back. Until a couple of weeks ago, when, having exhausted just about every other food place in Surprise two dozens times over, I came up with the jolly idea of getting us some Lucky's again based on all the good reviews. And I hated it just as much this time around as the first. UGH.  The only positive thing I can say about this place is that they give you a ~monstrous~ amount of pizza. Imagine a large pizza box precisely filled with a giant square BRICK of a pizza, easily an inch and a half tall and cut into square slices. That's what we got. I'd say it was over 3 pounds of pizza; flavorless and gross. I found it breathtaking that it had that little taste. This was a supreme pizza that tasted through and through like I was eating play-doh. Olives, sauce, cheese, crust, the works. To top it off, the mushrooms were slimy, canned champignons and not fresh at all, and tasted as though they'd just been pulled out of someone's nose. I've had some pretty bad pizza in my time, most of them I'd liken to eating chewy, dry cardboard. This was the first one that was this big and relatively succulent and STILL tasted gross.  I stomached maybe six slices over two sorry-ass sittings before throwing about 2/3 of the pizza away. Two pounds' worth of "food", down the sh1tter. I don't know where the mass delusion about this place comes from, but I'll never return. If I want a gutbuster special, especially now that Bronco Billy's is gone, I'll head to Rays just down the road instead. Plus, Lucky's is overpriced. A large and a smaller pizza cost us $30. Most of the smaller pizza was thrown away too - I didn't try any of that one so I'm not reviewing it, but the wife said she was incredibly unimpressed with it, and it was just a plain cheese. If it all tasted good it would have been worth it - I'd have paid that and more for a Chuck Wagon Special from Billy's - but the lack of flavour and value drops my rating of this joint to a bottom-of-the-barrel single star. And just for proverbials and giggles: http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=inspectionResultsDrillDownAA&permit=FD-05766&business=Lucky's%20Pizza&address=15508%20W%20Bell%20Rd%20Suite%20207&insp_id=3182324

Can't recommend this place highly enough. It's a heck of a drive here from where we live in Surprise but it's my 4-year-old's favourite place to play. After the first couple of visits we got the 3-person membership for a year which will save us a ton of money since we'll probably go here at least once every couple of weeks. It's a "museum" only in the loosest sense; in fact as others have mentioned it's actually a giant playground with tons of things to see and do spread across multiple floors. A list of all the playthings inside can be found here (http://www.childrensmuseumofphoenix.org/facility/Exhibits.aspx). In particular, the Schuff-Perini Climber, which is a giant structure resembling a treehouse with crazy stuff like a bathtub hanging off it, is phenomenal. Except when fat adults thinking to keep up with their children try to worm through certain parts of it. They even have Adirondack-style deckchairs in that room so that those seated down have a more elevated angle of view at their kids climbing two or three stories above them. Basically my kid, who at four is easily taller than most five-year-olds with the strength and energy of Bam Bam off the Flintstones, rapid-fires every single plaything every time we go - rushing around the climber, then heading up the stairs to pedal furiously on the trikes, then running (a no-no, always have to tell him to slow down so he doesn't blitz other kids) through the noodle forest, etc. It's sensational to watch. Even more delightful is how hard he crashes out in the back seat of the car, dried sweat plastering his bangs to his forehead with his mouth in the shape of an O, not more than three minutes back on the road after leaving.  Trust me, if you bring your younger kids here you will have a tough time getting them to leave at the end of the visit. There's also a gift shop with some interesting toys well-suited to kids under 10 - yesterday we bought my kid a "marble racer" (http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=10995054) and the time before we got a giant plastic boat for bathtime. The gift shop is a great incentive when it's "time to head home". And the P.C.M. is also super close to Mrs White's Golden Rule Cafe which is one of my favourite "quirky" eateries in Phoenix.  Take your young ones here, you won't be sorry. Just make sure you pack elbow pads, shin pads and helmets for them in case my kid's there too *8-) Let's pretend I gave it ten stars.  Edit: I created some panoramas of the Schuff-Perini Climber on photosynth.net using the Microsoft Photosynth app on my iPod Touch. Check em out. #1: http://j.mp/kfLVTC #2: http://j.mp/k0oArr #3: http://j.mp/jMDofn #4: http://j.mp/jC2eAC

Second time I've been to Vogue. Nicely appointed little place. The waiting area is a little tight when there's more than three people (a la Babbo) - in our case we had a reservation for 6:30pm and about 2 minutes after we arrived a bunch of Sun City q-tips showed up, like they always do, crowding us out while we waited to be seated. While waiting I noticed that I appeared a little underdressed by comparison with the other patrons but quite frankly I didn't care. I was just in t-shirt and cargo pants. Everyone else appeared to be dressed in their Sunday finest for church. Kind of like when someone goes to a Chinese or sushi restaurant, all of a sudden they feel compelled to fumble about with chopsticks and eat at a quarter the speed they could otherwise with knife and fork. It's Surprise, for crying out loud, not Scottsdale. Anyway, we were seated and at that point I no longer felt cramped. Next up was Jonathan, the waiter, who explained all the specials for that evening. He knew them pretty well, but we felt like we needed a Mensa certification to be able to parse and remember them all - one of those times when you really had to isolate the item you wanted and lock it in mentally before he completed his encyclopediac explanation of all ten specials and their garnishings.  I got the frog legs appetizer - have not had those in YEARS. Not bad, but small as you'd imagine. Had I KNOWN it cost $13 I would have certainly gotten something else, probably the farro? For the entree, I went for the big $33 ribeye which was that night's special. DAMN was it good. My knife cut through the steak like butter. Came with those tiny fingerling potatoes and enoki mushrooms. The wife settled for the Vogue Burger because someone at her work apparently frequents this place and loves it. She, too, wasn't disappointed. She got a Vogue Martini - strong and good. We brought my toddler - he had the kid's slider with shoestring fries and enjoyed both.  I've decided that my steak was the second best I've ever had in my life. Perfectly cooked to my request too (strangely, though, Jonathan asked what "temperature" we wanted our meat - after a second's worth of blank look I was tempted to let him know that if the meat wasn't precisely 144 degrees I would send it back, but settled on specifying "medium"). Best steak I've ever had is still my first Prime Rib, but of course anywhere outside of Nebraska would be hard pressed to beat local, fresh Omaha beef. See my review of The Drover in Omaha NE for more details. This one was very close behind.  Would I go back here? Sure, for a special occasion, such as on this night. Was it worth the money? Tough call. I'd say yes, but just barely. Better value than Don and Charlie's in Scottsdale, that's for damn sure. Hopefully Surprise will wind up with more of this sort of place. They have a very good selection of food and drink on the menu and decent sized portions - none of that giant-plate-micro-meal rubbish.

Holy CRAP was this place packed today!! It's gotten astronomically popular since it arrived in this location about two or three years ago, and despite being a decent-sized establishment, if you arrive dead on at midday you're in for at least a five to ten min wait unless you're lucky. Just like I wrote in my review of Vogue Bistro, I felt like I wasn't dressed appropriately, although this time it was because while I was wearing brown camo cargo pants and a grey t-shirt, seemingly everyone else there - both typical patrons and servers alike - were dressed like they were starring in a Wiggles on-stage production. I'm a big fan of the Chicken Tikka Masala, which I've been ordering ever since it was an experiment listed on a sheet of A4 paper attached to the main menu; it's now a regular item. I also get the caramelized cauliflower with tahini which is utterly delicious. I'm NOT a big fan of cheap, sh1tty tattoos though, and I saw a whole stack of those too.  Today was more or less a day like any other. Met the wife here, sat down, were promptly served our food. I went for the lavosh shawarma wrap instead of my usual since I'm trying to cut down on carbs (a very slight cutdown.. whatever!) but did get the cauliflower too. The cauli was different today. For a start, they brought it out on a full-sized plate, whereas it's normally served on a side-item-sized plate. Was fine with me as the wife usually shares it. While the lavosh wrap was absolutely delicious as I remember it being, the tahini sauce that went along with the cauli was weirdly sweet. Like it had sugar or syrup mixed in with it. Usually it's a more tan color and savoury, but this time it was more on the amber/orange side. When the server passed by I asked him whether the recipe had officially changed - he said no, and that they might have overdone one of the ingredients in the kitchen, but he definitely noticed the difference in color too. I said I was asking because I wouldn't order it again if it tasted the same, but I'm a big fan of the usual sauce. He said he'd check with the kitchen.  Not more than a couple of minutes later he comes back carrying a giant dessert plate with a slice of duo-tone baklava on it, covered in giant sultanas (aka golden raisins, I believe) and dusted in cinnamon powder by way of compensation. Jesus on a pogo stick. Chevy Chase could have tobogganed down a snowy hill on the bastard. It was delicious - I shouldn't have eaten it but I did. Even the wife, who isn't a big fan of baklava, took a couple of bites and proclaimed that it was the best baklava she had ever had. Very nice of them to do this, especially being so busy. Double-size side item plate and a comped dessert for two - you folk in Liberia are sure missing out! Definitely coming back (I would have anyway, I had no major problem with the meal).  I thoroughly recommend this place, it's a great all-round location if you want reasonably healthy macrobiotic stuff in a funky kind of atmosphere, long as you don't mind some of the saddest tattoos you'll probably ever see. They thoroughly deserve their high rating and a Yelp ambassador should consider giving them one of those "People love us on Yelp!" stickers that are inexplicably given to other places such as Mr Goodcents. Although, if you want proper fresh Greek, Greek Wraps just up the road trumps them. I'd rock up there for a chicken kabob wrap on their freshly baked pita any day of the week. And no, owner of Chicago Gyros, they didn't pay me to say that. BTW, Greek Wraps did a giant renovation around Christmas last year, the place is almost literally three times bigger. Now if only Haji Baba's would renovate that rancid cesspit they call a restroom..

Far as I'm concerned, this is the best pizza in the Surprise area. I haven't been back here for a while (diet, unfortunately) but tonight I decided to go again. Pizza was the same as last time - delicious. I'm a big fan of the Chuck Wagon special. The wife hates it because there are so many toppings that the crust is a little soggy, and I'd agree (I don't actually consider that a bad thing) however tonight for the first time we actually ate there rather than getting delivery. Fresh from the oven, the Chuck Wagon is spectacular. See my photo (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/i2DcZyW9vmocjpuPNcyOgA?select=WJxVZcpB57UkpQQvLuay4w). Crust was fresh and not soggy. I guess it's designed to be eaten immediately. I love the toppings, although the linguica is kind of an acquired taste perhaps, sort of like anchovies I guess in terms of the slightly odd aftertaste. Still, a great pizza. They have a couple of old arcade games in there, including a multi-game tabletop with classics like Ms Pacman, Burger Time and Space Invaders all in one. My kid and a couple of kids from another group clustered around it and had plenty of fun while the pizza was cooked. I got a bunch of quarters from the counter and had my kid share a couple of games with his new friends - Centipede and some weird Donkey Kong knock-off where he smacks a couple of beehives around before Jr tries to save him (I never saw that one before). Then we sat down to the meal - me with my Chuck Wagon, the wife and kid with their boring-ass cheese and Canadian bacon special. He polished off two full slices, not too bad for a slim four-year-old. I liked it, the kid liked it and the wife liked it this time too. Not exactly the cheapest pizza when you compare it with Papa Jomino's but I don't mind supporting good local businesses - I told the dude to make sure he didn't close down like half the other places in Surprise (Ritter's, El Paso etc) before we left. The place isn't the ultimate in decor but it was neatly kept and the pizza was ready in ten mins. Good sized benches and tables and there's even a private-ish room with tables for birthday parties or whatever. In keeping with the 80's flavor they had 99 Luftballons on the radio. So, I'll sum up the meal with four words: floogen, doogen, boogen kriegen.  Edit: Despite me ordering the guy not to close due to the economy, he closed due to the economy. Someone please explain to me why shitholes like Lucky's Pizza, Federicos and Macayos thrive and truly decent places like this and Ritters Custard wither and die? NOT happy.

I've eaten at a LOT of McDonalds' in multiple countries but this place is the WORST when it comes to quality. My wife takes the pickles off her burgers and when she recently opened up a southwest chicken sandwich there was what appeared to be LINT on the bottom of it! We were busy that evening, kept it in the fridge to take back, didn't have time the next day and then it obviously didn't matter.. I've bought filet-o-fishes where the tartar sauce is slopped so far on the side of the sandwich that most of it winds up in the box, and a couple of nights ago we gave them one last chance - wife brought back my order of 2 filet-o-fishes and I looked in the bag and asked why they'd given us chicken sandwiches? She checked inside and said they were just the wrong box but the f-o-f's were correct. Fair enough. Then she had another look in the fucking bag and found they'd given her a spicy chicken sandwich instead of a double cheeseburger. WTF? I mean obviously she checks the bag when they pass it into the vehicle window but when you see the correct number of boxes/items in a darkened car interior you assume you're good to go, right? You're not going to check between the damn burger's legs to determine its gender, right? Basically this place SUCKS, the franchise owner has no clue about quality control and we're not eating there again. I'll see if I can find the pic of the lint on the burger that she sent me from her Blackberry. Avoid this place and just get Culvers or Jack in the Box instead.  Incidentally, this is the first McDonalds in over thirty years that I've had anything near this sort of tragic experience with, which is mainly the reason we went back after we got the lintburger..

Dumb dumb DUMB. Shame on me. I went back here again after I swore I wouldn't. Ordered a #4 combo - that's 2 cheeseburgers - plus diet coke, at the drivethru. Get my order and reach in the bag to feel around. I can feel a frickin BOX in there. Lo and behold, they've given me a single filet-o-fish in the bag!! Back home I take a sip of the diet coke, and stop dead. Give it to my wife. She confirms. It's regular coke. IDIOTS! This place should be shut down, it's the absolute worst McDonalds I have EVER experienced. INCREDIBLY annoyed, enough to write in to the head office.

Didn't like this place at all. Portions too expensive and one of my workmates said that his pita (cost him $7) felt more like a McDonalds snack wrap than a full sized sandwich. He got the buffalo chicken pita. I got the babaghannoush one. The menu said that it has eggplant. Now I KNOW that babaghannoush *contains* pureed eggplant but the way it was written led me to believe that there was going to be some fried eggplant or something in it. No such luck. Next, I'm called over with "Sir, I can help you over here" as though I hadn't given my order yet. My bad, I didn't realise that next up it was Subway time. Agnieszka the eastern bloc ESL preparer asks me "white or wheat?" and then dollops some babaghannoush on the pita and asks if I want "side items". I asked for some mushrooms and onions. Then she tucks it together and I'm like - oh, wait, that's ALL I'm getting? Cold, too. No toasting option. Basically six bucks for a snack wrap, and both of us were still hungry after. Avoid this place. If you ever want a decent pita meal, you cannot go wrong with "The Greek Wraps" (http://www.yelp.com/biz/greek-wraps-peoria) - get a chicken shawarma wrap with some dolmas and falafels - badaBING! (throws fist in the air emphatically) And if you want Subway style, just go to any given Mr Goodcents and get a whole original. This place is a poor man's mix of both.

Okay, it almost seems a shame to burst the bubble of the positive reviews of this place, but I just have to.   I'm not an Indian food expert, but I am a serious enthusiast and I've eaten at dozens of Indian places on three continents, not to mention my family being from the vicinity of that area of the world and therefore having grown up on curry and rice and all things spice.  We went here for lunch yesterday (Sunday), thanks to a Yelp/Aloqa recommendation after we'd had a romp at Estrella Mountain Park and were starving. The place was almost deserted at 1pm, with only one other table occupied - fair enough. We went for the buffet. And I have to say, it was simply "okay". The buffet didn't have a particularly wide variety of stuff - several items were cheap regulars such as the saag and the dhal - spinach and lentils for the uninitiated. They did have aloo zucchini, never seen that before - tasted okay, about as good as I'd have been able to make it (and that's actually not a compliment). No lamb dishes - disappointing, but unfortunately this is also rare.  Flavorwise, I found it boring and unspectacular. Saag is saag, tandoori chicken is tandoori chicken, except their chicken was very light on the tandoori smoke flavour. None of the food left the slight zing on my tongue that it should have. Rice was okay, but then you typically can't go wrong with cooking basmati (although another reviewer's mileage apparently differed on this count). We had our almost-3-year-old along and he did have a little rice, chicken and beef - it was his first real curry and thus a pretty substantial milestone for us. Then the wife went to get a little kheer and a gulab jamun ball. The kheer was watery but tasted okay - compared unfavourably to the sabudaana kheer at India Palace. The jamun ball was almost completely solid - you had to press real hard with a fork to cut it, normally they're nice and soft and soaked. However, another one I got was normal - so it was just the luck of the draw there. Beef curry was nice, although the first piece I ate was mainly fat - whatever, you get that and I don't mind it. The fried pakoras can normally be cut through with a fork. These you had to saw through with a knife - not great, chewy to the point of almost being crunchy. No samosas in the buffet. The naan was unusual. I've had a LOT of naan before and this stuff was the uncommon kind, not thick and pita-ey but instead a little more like a roti. It tasted very fresh - we had plain and also garlic - and the wife really liked it. Kid did too. I personally prefer the other sort of naan - softer and a little more substance to it, but this one had merit regardless. However, it took at least fifteen minutes after our food was served before the naan arrived.  All up, middle of the road as far as I'm concerned, although the wife quite liked it. Note that this is for the buffet only - we did not have a-la-carte and perhaps the to-order cooked food may have tasted better. I've had better buffets - the best one in Phoenix west of the 17 IMO is India Palace - a wider variety, a lot busier (as a result, I'm sure) and more flavourful food. Admittedly, I haven't tried any other Indian places south of Bell but west of the 17 except for Sutra. Bell appears to have most of them?  I would normally have given this place a flat three stars, but I'm going to give it an extra half and round up for a few reasons. Firstly, the waiter was real nice and very attentive - up to the standard of a typical US chain place, rather than the silent wanderers with the Easter Island statue facial expressions at other buffets who do no more than refill your water and clear your dirty dishes every fifteen minutes or so. He was asking us how we were doing, offered refills of my wife's iced tea at appropriate times etc. Spot on. Next, there's a buffet discount where all kids under 10 are $5 - however, we noticed that they appropriately knocked the price down to $3.50 for us, unbidden and I guess for the simple reason that he was set up in a high chair and obviously only ate 1/4 of a breakfast bowl worth of food in total. Third, the place had nice decor (although I was a bit concerned there were no tablecloths, with my kid banging his plastic sippy cup and spilling sh1t all over the tabletop) and thankfully they didn't have sh1tapple wudda-wudda-waa-waa pretentious bhangra muzak playing in a cheap attempt at making you feel like you're actually in India.  I'd eat here again, but only if I'm in the area and DYING for Indian food. It simply didn't measure up, either buffet-wise or flavour-wise. For first-timers, I can see how they would have enjoyed the experience - clean seating area, Americanized flavours and a good waiter. My experience, however, has been burned in over almost four decades and I've kicked the tyres of more cuisines from this area of the world than I can recount, especially Indian. Three and a half, rounded up to four, Seacrest out.

Went back here for lunch today. It was my second time (first time was last week) and this time I brought my boss along. The last time they didn't have their supreme master sh1te on, and this time both tellys were blank. Disappointed, I actually asked whether they could put it on after reading some of the reviews on here, just to have a bit of a laugh. On it came. It's not that bad - there was some Asian woman getting laughs from an audience, evidently the opening act for the Supreme Master himself. It all comes from California, apparently - why doesn't this surprise me? We chuckled for a bit (mainly at how rapidly the subtitles and other stuff were flashing on the screen, almost like Max Headroom blipverts) then turned to our food. I got the pho with their Golden Rolls, the boss got a bowl of curry with a side of brown rice served in the traditional way (bowl up and over). All it needed was a hershey's chocolate kiss on the top and it would have looked just like a tit. Anyway. The pho was actually pretty good - they made a fine job out of cloning standard pho dac biet, even to the extent of having some gristly stuff that simulated tripe. The "meat" was pretty good - I too was really surprised that it looked and tasted so close to regular meat. The boss liked his stuff as well. A touch on the expensive side (veggie stuff should be just a little cheaper than eight bucks a pop, which is what some of their entrees cost) but on the whole it's pretty tasty stuff. And the people in there are sort of amusing. I ordered my pho and the guy goes "whoa, that'll taste really good".. I told him I usually went for the dac biet and he was like.. "yeah yeah, this is just as good.. except.. BETTER." I said that I was expecting to become a supreme master after eating it or else I was going to be asking for my money back. The little old server lady was very nice; she saw me eating rolls with my fingers and dropped off some chopsticks for me so I didn't get ketchupy paws. So in summary: good food, seemed like a clean place, reasonably unique menu, fairly non-confrontational television propaganda, not overcrowded, priced as something that could make it a weekly treat for me, and cholesterol free to boot.

Went back again today. I quite like this place. Their stuff isn't extremely cheap (it's tempting to go to Pink Lotus instead -  under $6 for the same amount of food) but it's not insanely overpriced and the place remains clean as a whistle. It seems to be gaining in popularity too - had about five or six tables with patrons today, despite the Supreme Master telly droning on in the background. It actually reminds me of the "a new life awaits you in the off-world colonies!" stuff from Blade Runner. Today's programming showed some kangaroos jumping around and happily munching grass, along with someone blathering on about how studies have shown that they play an important ecological role in blah blah blah. Anyway! Foodwise, I got my (now favourite) Golden Rolls, and decided to try something different with the Chow Mein. The latter was good, but I probably wouldn't order it again since I liked other dishes better. Next time I think I'll give the Hawaiian Burger a go. I definitely recommend the Golden Rolls - the dipping sauce is great as well.  If you eat there rather than take away you'll get a little bowl of soup - their version of miso, I guess, with carrot, green onion, celery (yeuch) and tofu bits.  Came away feeling satisfied but not grossed out - typical of vegetarian meals. I wish Sweet Tomatoes was a little closer, haven't been there in quite a while!  You know, I wonder if this place would get pissed if I brought in a tiny can of cocktail shrimp to empty out into their vegetarian pho. There aren't any signs saying meat eating on the premises is forbidden, although the entire place reeks of Buddhist philosophy. I remember getting reprimanded back in Sydney when we used to go to the free Hare Krishna Sunday feasts and bring our own cans of Coke ("Krsna forbids intoxicants!"). Or maybe if I picked up a chicken wrap from Greek Wraps down the road then brought it in to eat with a side of their Guru Fried Rice. After all, they're selling a food style, not a lifestyle. Whatever the case, as mentioned in my previous review, this place is probably a once-a-week for me now.

Went in today and got the Golden Vermicelli. Same great taste, same store and same service, but that dish cost me $9.29. My older copy of the take-out menu here at work shows it as $7.25 which IMO was already on the upper end of value for a vegetarian meal. Considering the fact that I can get an entire giant roast chicken for $4.99 at Frys near my house, which can be turned into four separate meals, I'm going to be reducing the amount of time I spend going here. Just starting to not be affordable and with the economy the way it is I simply cannot justify a ten buck lunch. Still four stars.. but now it's "barely" 4. Come to think of it, I might buy a roast chicken and bring some of it in here to eat along with some of their veggies on the side. Think they'd mind?

Unfortunately I will no longer be recommending Loving Hut. Is it because the food tastes like crap? No. Is it due to weird hours of business or bad service? No. It's because it's just too expensive now. Bordering on a complete rip-off.  I got my usual Golden Vermicelli with a side of the Golden Rolls since I really like those (the GV comes with two rolls already). With tax, minus any drink and minus the $1 tip that I felt obliged to add since there was a tip section on the docket, the total was $13.12. I already mentioned that they've hiked their prices from the outdated menu that I got a few months ago, but I took another look at what I got and I'm not impressed at all with the value for money.  Let's break it down. Shredded lettuce, shredded carrots, a half teaspoon of ground peanut with half as much again of finely chopped fried onion, a good amount of noodles (maybe even 20c worth), and a container of extremely watered down liquid - maybe 100 parts water to 1 part sweet and sour sauce? It's not a dip and not a sauce, just something to wet down the noodles with. Maybe 2 slices of julienned cucumber, and their soy protein. Took a photo. Compare today's pic with the first one I took of the same dish. There's even less soy protein now, barely enough for two mouthfuls, and a couple of fried rolls the length and width of my extended middle finger. I'm not sure how expensive soy protein itself is but thirteen spondooliks for that is twice as much as it is worth in terms of raw ingredients, far as I'm concerned.  The place is still clean. The service is still okay. Servers and counter folk are still very polite. Still conveniently located near my work. Still has Super Master on the telly. Still has a posterboard near the counter with bizarre letters and postcards from people verbally flagellating their pudendae about how awesome the place is, and the food is still tasty. Just woefully, WOEFULLY overpriced. This same syndrome exists at Tandoori Times II. I'd eat there AND here three times as often if only they delivered an amount of their food which matches the exorbitant prices they charge.  Am I all about quantity over quality? Hell no. We're talking about a guy who paid over fourteen bucks for a small cube of fois gras on a 2" square bit of bread w/apricot compote, spent the next thirty minutes drooling over it and the next two years daydreaming about it. We're talking about a guy who just ate mostly lettuce and noodles and got charged twice the price of a lunch almost anywhere else in the local area, except for places like Claim Jumper or Olive Garden. Do I think 2 stars are appropriate a rating? Yelp classifies that as "Meh. I've experienced better." So, yes.  Even if you're a vegetarian, avoid this place. Save your cash. Go to Safeway. Buy a pack of noodles for a buck. Buy a whole lettuce for a buck. Buy carrots for.. you get the general idea. Buy some frozen edamame, mash it all up, squirt a bit of soy and worcester on it, form it into mint-patty-shaped discs and grill. I'm betting that'll be the same nutrition/protein and color as what their stuff is. Just pass on dining at this joint like I will be.  I thought about posting this review for a while. The tipping point was the tiny gnat that I noticed on a piece of lettuce and would have eaten had I not been hunched close over the meal in my cubicle. Could have flown into the container, through the plastic bag etc, on the way out to the car, on the way back to the office, on the way INTO the office from the car. Or could have landed during food prep. I spent the next five minutes visually analysing the rest of the food before realising that there could be more gnats in the fried rolls where I'd have no hope of noticing them. Shrug.

Having moved office to the Central Ave Corridor vicinity, I've been checking out some new restaurants in the area. I was delighted to know that 43rd Express, my previous favourite Phoenix Vietnamese place, was just a few miles down the road. However, a workmate told me about Pho Thanh and took me there for a meal. And it's now become my favourite V diner.  I'd read a number of reviews on Yelp indicating that this place is one of those hole-in-the-wall gems, and to tell the truth it's not much to look at from the outside, just a dodgy door and blacked out windows in a nondescript brick building. But you kinda get a bit of a shock when you walk in, because it's WAY bigger on the inside than you'd have guessed standing in the carpark. Seedyish, and very popular. I saw all sorts of people inside, not just Asians. That's always a good sign. Sat down and got my usual - pho dac biet, xe lua. Delivered quick and piping hot. Gigantic bowl. Tasted fantastic, although pretty light on the tendon chunks, which are my absolute favourite bits in the soup. I also got a fresh coconut and had a joyous time draining it then scraping out the soft flesh with a long-handled spoon, feeling at times like a monkey with a damn cookie jar.   They accept credit cards, which is awesome - 43rd Express does not, and since Pho Thanh essentially serves more pho in their bowl with the same quality I don't think I'll be returning to 43rd anytime soon; I'm also not keen on having to use an ATM first every time I want to eat there. Get a credit card processing system in place, sheesh.  Four stars. Lots of room inside, busy at lunchtime, good amount of chow, great taste, other Yelpers really like it (we're a discerning bunch, right?) and not too far from work. Oh, and the credit card thing. I don't mind the fact that they've got these long tables where you could potentially be elbow-to-elbow with a stranger, either. Just an overall decent place to fill up at, with or without a crowd of workmates.

Had a hankering for a bagel today (which is pretty uncommon for me) and decided to head up with a couple of fellow workers to this place. Of COURSE the oven was busted and they didn't have any bagels, so I wound up ordering a lox sandwich on rye bread. For some reason they kept calling this a "nova", although I just googled "nova lox sandwich" and now know why, but I didn't at the time so I was squinting at the menu and confirming that I was actually getting an ELL OH ECKS sandwich. The sandwich was pretty good, but at over seven bucks it was a little pricey - any lunch at that price (including my favourite Fuji Apple Chicken salad at Paradise Bakery) places it into the "rare treat" category, especially when you can buy one whopper and get one free @ less than half the price from Burger King these days. And I'm guessing a whopper would be pretty on-par with the Nova sandwich, health-wise. AND I'd have gotten a better sandwich from Miracle Mile for roughly the same price. A-ny-way, good place, but bye bye one star for calling yourselves a bagel deli but not actually having any bagels on the one day of the year that I actually decide to visit. If I ever come back, you might regain the star (assuming your bagels are actually as good as others have observed).  Wonder what that accent is..?

Not a bad place. Small, colorful (the Ikea Klippan sofa with the retro orange cover made me chuckle) and a decent set of toppings. The kid loves it as a treat after having a meatball sub from Subway just across the parking lot. I still miss Yogurtland (Whaler's Village, Kaanapali Beach, Maui) which had sugarfree (much better for you, just in case you didn't know) and far better peoplewatching outside *8-) And I miss Ritter's. My kid calls this place Yogurtland, which it ain't. But if your pancreas still works fine and you don't mind redlining it and risking type II diabetes, knock yourself out.  Reply to Joe B: Didn't know that! I'll check this out next time we go.. possibly this evening.

Well, Joe the owner was right. Went here again a couple of nights ago. The joint was truly jumping. Lo and behold, not only was there sugarfree yogurt, but it was macadamia and white chocolate chip (my favourite flavour of cookie!) For the first time I had a cup of their yogurt, along with a sprinkle of chopped peanut and almond. About as good as you can get from sugarfree, I guess. Once again the kid loved it, and so did the wife. Forgot to mention - they have a loyalty punch card, buy ten and get one free or something like that. I think I'll be regular enough now to warrant keeping a card in the wallet, even if I don't personally indulge on each visit.

Unimpressed. Have been here a couple of times (forced to - the boss seems to think this is a better "team meeting" location than our conference room in the office, which I strongly disagree with). Music too loud during the brief spurts when either the waitress or a patron turns it on. Food takes too long to come out. Food barely average. Cougar waitress loves to try and sell you on their giant tabletop-sized pizza concept. No thanks. Also, too many TVs - all on one wall and all TVs were tuned to different channels, reminding me of Adrian Veidt's world monitor wall (in the Watchmen graphic novel). Just a dingy place that I recommend you avoid.

Went here to get a quick dinner for the kid last night between his karate class and our gym session. Not a particularly good experience. The guy behind the counter was efficient enough, the food came out quick enough (we only bought a small chicken sandwich for the kid), but eating there was a MISTAKE. There was some ghetto-talking girl running the drive through and between customers she engaged in this loud, foul-mouthed diatribe. "She gon' say she want mah job, well she can go ahead and just take my f^ckin' job.. she say she gon' call child whatever on me that's fahn wid me know wh'am sayin', she k'n go  f^ck herself!" etc.. then a second later, sweet as molasses, "Hi, welcome to Church's Chicken, how may I help you?". My kid's not even 6 yet. I don't want him hearing the f-bomb every ten seconds in a so-called family restaurant.  I've had a good experience once, too - driving through, I spoke to a Sikh gent who may have been the manager, he seemed quite nice and offered me a free drink since I was wearing my karate gi and he thought I was one of the senseis at the karate place just opposite, but they need to work on their hired help and set some ground rules while on duty. Going by what happened to us and to the previous reviewer, they appear to have absolutely no problem in hiring complete ghetto trash. If that's what they talk like, god only knows what sort of biological waste products my kid might have eaten on his sandwich last night. Not planning to return, and if this keeps up I'm expecting the place to fold pretty soon.  Incidentally, I just read the filtered reviews of this place. I suggest you do as well. Wow.

I'm weirded out by how many great reviews this place got versus the experience I had. About the only thing I can agree with is that the owner seems like a friendly, accommodating chap. Went here for lunch today with a friend.  First thing we saw upon turning into the parking lot was a slow-moving drunkard swaying and staggering about holding a super slurper which I'm sure was full of cheap wine cut with drano. Definitely an extremely dingy mall, and in fact this little hole in the wall place wasn't much better. Chairs with ripped vinyl, for example. Grabbed a couple of menus and sat down. We were asked what we wanted to drink. The drinks turned out to be cans in a fridge on the other side of a couple of tiny saloon doors, almost actually in the kitchen area. Basically implying no free refills. We were asked to help ourselves. Fair enough. My friend asked for ice. The guy said that they didn't have any but they'd go grab some - and that's what happened! One of the staff came back with a bag of ice purchased from somewhere outside, like a gas station? Anyway, chilled glasses and ice followed - I didn't use mine because I don't really feel bagged ice is exactly something I want to drink, versus ice made from filtered water (shrug). Anyway. A little odd so far. We ordered some appetisers, $5 each for 4 falafel pieces. The guy said that the falafel plate was a better deal, $6 for 6 pieces total. Fair enough, appreciate the tip.  Falafel comes out first. Didn't really like it. They looked more like small Pepperidge Farm cookies than the traditional "Monet haystack" shape, and tasted mealy and undercooked. Hummus was more like babaghanoush consistency and not particularly flavourful. Plates came out. Mine was $9.95 for the chicken shawarma. The rice appeared to be long-grain basmati, tasted ok but several of the grains were dry and crunchy, to the point that my friend commented later that he thought he had broken and crunched on a tooth filling. There wasn't enough chicken on the plate. The pita bread served on our plates and on the falafel one was the sort that upon losing its warmth turns basically into shoe leather and would challenge a rabid dog in terms of tearing and chewing. The salad was ok and the dressing was pretty good, but I wasn't there for a salad. The presentation of the meal on the plate was good. Pic here: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/athens-gyros-phoenix?select=P8-8ovsHCLqfCf_zqQ8uUg#R8njJz2kWGJWNO74b5WL5Q - but for perspective, the palm of my hand could have covered the amount of chicken provided.  I've had far better Greek meals. Wow. For something that's truly fresh and delicious in this style of cuisine I always fall back on old faithful, Greek Wraps on Bell near 75th Ave. This didn't even come close in terms of taste. Not even in the same suburb, let alone ball park. $17 with tip for my meal, and I was still hungry afterward. Was sorely tempted to hit up Sacred Hogan's Fried Bread a few storefronts down for dessert. HOGAAAAANNNNNN!

Went to PoaF for lunch today. Ordered the Smokin Meal with bbq beans, sweet potato fries and spicy sausage. Came with a pickle spear, and I also got a small container of their hot sauce. Damn good meal for ~$10. Probably some of the best BBQ I've had, although the meat was kinda fatty. Loved the pulled pork. Wondered what the yellowish slug-like bits in the sausage were then realised that they were chunks of CHEESE. This is going to have to be a rare treat for me, I probably threw down more than twice my entire daily calorie limit in a single meal, but it's nothing a bit of furious pedalling on my exercise bike won't rectify. I hope. Five stars for the food. Yelp also has a checkin deal - three checkins nets you $5 off your meal. That could be more than half your meal's cost, depending on what you get. I'm one down so far.

Back to PoaF today. I went yesterday, racked up my second Yelp checkin, and then brought the wife in today for my third (== $5 discount off meal). I'm rapidly becoming addicted to the food here, although it's pretty far from healthy and extremely distant from what I *SHOULD* be eating at lunch. The wife claimed that this was some of the best BBQ she's ever had. Very friendly guys too. I have to echo the observations of others though - it's a small place and the fact that they have nothing but four-seater tables means that even when two people sit they blow two extra spaces in an already cramped area. They either need a bench with bar stools, some two-top tables or a giant texas-style community eating bench. Yeah, I deliberately spelled texas with a lower-case t. Today, the place was full but the counter dude said it was okay to sit at the coffee place just outside on the corner of the same building, which we did after I confirmed with the coffee gal that that was ok. Anyway, back to the food: I agree with the wife, it's some of the best BBQ I've ever had. The different sauces are great too - my favourite is the pulled pork with one of their hot sauces. It's Nebraska hot, I guess - means that us Southwesterners could probably pour it into our eyes without blinking - but still tasty. Five stars for flavor and value, two for seating arrangements. As the place grows in popularity - and it will - they're -really- going to need to address this issue. As for me, I'm going to enjoy this place as frequently as I can before our office moves to Central and Thomas later this year, whereupon PoaF will unfortunately become a distant, delicious memory.  Edit: Okay, twice now I've gotten the smoked meal and asked for no buns, and they've given me buns. Minor mistake, but I'll deduct a star if it happens again. No buns equals ~no buns~.

I'm going to have to partially agree with Debra O, and I can guarantee you I do NOT work at a competing restaurant. And you freakin well BETTER "believe my review". The prices are very expensive here. Our total bill for two people and one three year old came to $54. That's with a simple chicken and steak dish for me ($22), a hibachi vegetables with chicken on the side for the wife and a noodles and chicken for the kid. No sushi. Inside, the place is okay - although they took us to the back room (we opted for the sushi side rather than the hibachi side) which was very cramped - even without it being particularly full we still had to move chairs out of the way in order to scoot through to our table. The food was okay - I've had better. I would have gone for a little nigiri or sushi rolls had I not been put off by the price - a SINGLE piece of yellowtail nigiri for $2.50? Pfft. The rainbow roll wasn't the common one with shrimp, yellowtail etc, which I ALWAYS get - instead the picture showed it with different colored fish roe instead. Pass. Didn't look like they had spicy crab roll either. Already, Fresh Wasabi was ahead IMO. The kid's dish was adult-sized, far more than a three year old could hope to eat unless they're a Ricki Lake special. My kid is not.  The highlight was the server. He was very attentive, friendly and helpful - returned several times, always kept the glasses filled, had a couple of menu recommendations, offered to help by looking up deals at the counter for the chicken/veg combo the wife ordered to see if he could punch in a better deal (which didn't happen, but whatever), and even boxed our takeout for us. Then again, doubling the tax got him a hefty ten buck tip so.. (shrug)  Won't be going back, I'm afraid. Simply because this is apparently the only teppanyaki restaurant in Surprise doesn't immediately convince me that I need to gush over how awesome it is. That Greek place down on Reems that died and got replaced by Nick's Diner was awesome. Ritters was awesome. Babbo's spaghetti and meatballs special is awesome. This place is meh, bordering on bad value for money especially in this shitburger economy where even McDonalds is now offering two big macs for $3. You can feed two people for $3 and I fed three tonight for almost $55. Seriously, I tried my hand at Gordon Ramsay's smoked paprika chicken stroganoff recipe a couple of nights ago (although I substituted pork loin strips for chicken and roasted poblanos for green peppers), and not only were the ingredients half the price of my meal tonight but what I made was twice as delicious. When I go to a restaurant I'm after food that tastes BETTER than my own cooking yeah. Snort. Bring back El Paso!

The Wayne-Dalton door at my rental house busted and couldn't be lifted manually or operated with the door opener. After calling several places, two of which didn't even pick up and some which suggested service calls of over $80 just to come out and take a look (what happened to the days of free in-home quotes?!) we found Legends Garage Door. Cory was prompt, friendly and professional. He called a couple of days before the appointment to confirm the date/time, called when he was en route to the premises and I met him there. My father in law (a home inspector) had taken a look at the door and said that it weighed probably 300 pounds and wouldn't be able to be lifted. Cory basically grabbed the door and hauled it upward like it was made of paper. The rest of the work was just as impressive - if you've ever seen Guido the forklift "peet stop" tire change scene in the movie Cars you'll know what I mean. The work was done in record time, including lubricating the tracks and door joints, and it was fairly educational for me too (he suggested not to use silicone-based garage door lubricant if I was going to do the job myself in the future), plus he has a 24-hour door service for emergencies. Since the spring wasn't broken and only needed to be tightened, $49 was all that was charged for the service call. In addition I was going to ask him to fix one of the light sockets in the door opener as it was fried, probably due to an insect crawling into it - he took down the model number and other details and said that he would need a replacement part but wouldn't charge a service call again, it would just be part and labour. The renter decided they were fine with a single bulb working so in the end we didn't need to arrange that repair.  I thoroughly recommend Cory and Legends Garage Door - one of the best service calls I have ever had the pleasure of arranging.

Went here for lunch yesterday with the boss. I did a very cursory glance over the menu on their home page and was delighted to see that they had pho-style dishes here. Then only spent a second to check the Yelp star rating before heading out from the office. I read the reviews, as well as the owner retorts, after I got back home from the office - and laughed over the "butt-hurt one".. *8-) Reminiscent of the infamous Amy's Baking Company review and reply.. http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2010/08/ouch_todays_hard_lesson_on_yel.php for those of you who missed it the first time round..  Anyway, I've never had Cambodian food before, but I'm a big fan of pho and quite partial to Thai food as well. I'm going to agree with the hard-to-findness of the location. The boss let me know where it is, Google Maps AND Waze tried to tell me where it is, and I still had to circle back and triplecheck the map out front of a 99c store before I inched back out onto Indian School and finally dodged into a tiny catty-corner parking lot with a giant Mexican circular water fountain oddly set directly into the tarmac. No other vehicles except the boss' motorbike. Inside, greeted by the waiter (I assume Yutheana) and sat with the boss. Place was completely empty (apart from us) but I liked the decor - including the concave xylophone up front which reminded me a bit of a dinosaur's ribcage. At the table, I ordered a diet cola. It tasted a little odd - not horrible or anything, but sort of.. either the syrup was off or someone had put a tiny bit of honey in it? No matter. I found the description of their Phnomh Penh soup too amusing not to order it - "Got guts? Wahey - so does this soup!" Who could resist heart, liver, intestines, ground pork and shrimp in a pho broth? The boss ordered the Amok Fish.  The waiter came over for a bit of a chat and overheard us talking about how the place was hard to find. Apparently they used to have a sign out front.. which went away for some reason. This place needs blinking neon lights and perhaps a sandwich-board holder wearing a pig intestine costume or something, because it's absolutely nondescript when you're driving past and I'm actually very surprised to see so many reviews - must be word of mouth visits because it sure as hell wouldn't be people going "Hey, check this Cambodian restaurant out that we're driving past.."  Out came our dishes. High marks for presentation - it all looked quite appetizing, especially the fish dish. Unfortunately, flavour wise, mine was.. just a'ight. I honestly don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't as confrontational a flavour as I guess I thought it might be. In fact it was rather bland. I love spicy food - especially Indian - but usually with pho I drown it in lemon or lime. I put a squirt of lime down on the top and had a few bites. Shrugged at my boss. Surprisingly the lime did nothing for this dish - but a couple of big squeeze bottles of hot sauce had been supplied and I used that instead. THEN the dish came somewhat alive! Interesting.  Would I get the dish I got again? Probably not if I was hungry and/or after something with a little taste to it, but definitely if I wanted to shock friends. The boss didn't mind his but said there were probably four other dishes he'd like to try first before re-ordering the Amok. I didn't hate this place, I certainly didn't think the prices were too high like others observed, but it wasn't stunning enough to warrant more than a "passable" rating IMO.  Now if only someone would open up a MALAYSIAN restaurant - the last time I had a decent laksa was over a decade and seven thousand miles ago. Sigh.  Edit 20120414: I came to your restaurant looking for lunch. My review THEN went on to wish for a Malaysian restaurant, riding a completely different train of culinary thought. Imagine star number 3 on my review start to flicker as its batteries begin to run out.  Edit 20121030: Dropped to a single star based on the smart-mouthed and completely unnecessary response from the owner. Will not return.

Absolutely unimpressive. Went here for lunch yesterday with a couple of workmates. Which was a Tuesday - a day on which, inexplicably, all other Vietnamese restaurants in the area are CLOSED - so at least this was an initial point in their favour. If you've read my other Vietnamese restaurant reviews you'll know that I only ever eat pho (dac biet) and was planning to order that here. Eyes popped out of my head when I saw that they charge $10 for a bowl! There also weren't different sizes for the dish, so I guessed (correctly, as it turns out) that they only had a small size. Still, I decided to give it a shot. I also noticed that their menu was extremely limited - there were almost more varieties of spring roll, which I HATE, than pretty much any other food category. The waiter told us that they were famous for their rolls.. whatever. I got the pho.  It was a small size. Of course.  In fact, the amount of pho in the bowl was positively pissant. Within maybe five minutes I had finished it off completely and was still quite hungry. And just like Saigon Kitchen in Surprise, they served a small fistful of bean sprouts, some pathetic wilted basil, and a couple of tiny slices of lime. Basically a kids-meal-sized amount of garnish. Oh, and a tiny dish with nothing on it (arguably to contain sauce, though there was no sriracha or anything else on the table). The broth was almost tasteless and there were no tendon pieces at all. Trust me, I looked hard. I spent the next ten minutes fishing forlornly, and mostly unsuccessfully, for strands of noodles at the bottom of the broth.  They had a telly showing the Olympics above the bar. Unfortunately, half the communal dining benches face the opposite direction so I had to watch Sally Pearson take gold in the women's 100m hurdles in an ornate mirror. That was the high point of the experience.  They then gave us the wrong bill, which was presented as a receipt pinned to a small block with a cheap wooden clothespeg. Might as well have printed it on a sheet of sh1tter paper too.  Won't be going back. Barely got two stars. I'm happy to wait out the "Vietnamese weekend" - ie Tuesday - in future, and grab a bowl of pho that's twice the size and thrice the flavour for three bucks cheaper at Pho Thanh, Da Vang, Maxim or 43rd Express. If you like spring rolls, knock yourself out. If you like pho, freakin' avoid this place like the plague. Remember, New India Bazaar is a couple hundred yards down the road, and THEY have all you can eat - and all the flavour you need - for $8. I couldn't agree more with Matthew K - the value IS way out of line.

Pretty standard Subway. Although, they just got veggie patties in (opens up the Veggie Patty sandwich and the Veggie Max salad on the standard menu). This is pretty rare for a Subway, the only other one that I know of with Veggie Patties is the one on the NE corner of 19th Ave and Bell.

I've read several reviews of this place and others and I'm getting mighty tired of people from Chicago or New York or wherever blasting local restaurants because they don't have "authentic" food from their home town; pizza, hotdogs or whatever. This is PHOENIX. It's not Chicago. It's not New York. It's not St Paul, Minnesota (although for half the freakin' year it's hard to believe that last one). If you want authentic stuff from your home town then why the heck did you move here? I'm an Aussie and I never shoot places down simply because the hamburgers and fries don't taste like what I grew up with. If I don't like the food I say so. If I don't like the restaurant or service I say so, and vice versa. If only people could judge based on the individual pros or cons of restaurants and their ~local~ competition, and not some rose-coloured memory they have of sometime years ago or someplace three thousand miles away, things would be a lot fairer. Plus, this is a HOT DOG place, not some haute cuisine dining establishment! Exactly how different do Chicago buns or pickles taste?! If I maintained this same philosophy, every single Indian restaurant I've eaten at in Phoenix would get a single star rating. See how this works?  Rant over. Went here for dinner the other night, arrived at just after 6pm. A lady with iridescent blue eyes greeted us and was very friendly in discussing the different options. Truth to tell, there aren't many - Chicago Style, one or two other styles, and a kids menu with three or four combo options. The lady noticed our toddler and said that if he sat on the other side of the table she would turn cartoons on for him on one of the tellys. We ordered our stuff and out it came in a few minutes. First plus were the fries. If you've read my talk thread here (http://j.mp/ovV41z) you'll know how I feel about crispy fries. Props to this place for serving actually fresh fries (albeit with the skin on). Yes, they were a bit oily - you get that when fries are fried in oil. Yes, they were a bit soggy - you get that when fries aren't pre-processed by blanching. These fries are what you get when 1) you chop a potato and 2) fry it thereafter. Try it sometime. Go to In-N-Out, same thing. If you want crispy fries, go somewhere else. Me, I could have eaten them all. day. long.  Hotdogs were okay - it was my first go at Chicago style. I got two. Pickle, tomato was fine. The relish was sort of a bright fluorescent green - bizarre, but tasted ok. I didn't get the sport peppers as I had had jalapeno for lunch. One mistake was to forget to ask for no celery salt - I hate the taste of celery and the salt spoiled the dogs for me. I wiped off what I could. Still finished both. The wife enjoyed hers. She had a tray of chili fries - very good indeed. The kid wolfed down his dog and half his fries, as expected.  All in all, a great meal. I was checking in on Yelp when the wife told me that they had already closed. Sure as shinola it was after 7. I read on their facebook page that they're planning to stay open a little longer. 7pm shutdown is definitely way too early and puts this place dangerously close to White Eagle IMO in terms of stupid business hour planning. But, 6pm is fine for us for a family dinner and it's not like we got bounced out at closing time. Anyone looking to have dinner later, just stand in front of this place and then turn your heads left and right. Several options. You know, or else just move back to Chicago where everything is so much better.  I would have given this place a solid 3 star average, but it nosed up to 4 due to the thoughtfulness of the counter gal and the quality of the fries. Screw authentic, the food was good. And now I've half a mind to go eat at Portillo's in Chicago and then slam it on Yelp because the hotdogs didn't taste like the dogs I ate back in Phoenix. Oh wait, I said rant over, didn't I? (sips peppermint tea expressionlessly)

Okay. I'm a huge fan of Greek and other Mediterranean foods. When I saw this place and all the five star reviews, of course I figured it was worth checking out (despite it being next door to Chino Bandido - I still shudder when I think about how severe the food poisoning was that my wife and I got from that place a couple of years ago). Before I begin, this review started at 3 stars in my mind, went up to four and then back down to three. Explanation follows.  As with so many other Yelpers, I was immediately greeted upon entering the (empty at the time) establishment by a man who I assume was Ninos - and so for the rest of this review that's what I'll call him (even if it wasn't actually Ninos). Because this week I returned to my as-vegetarian-and-low-carb-as-possible diet, I was after something like falafels or dolmas for lunch. Ninos saw me looking at the menu and offered some suggestions. I asked for some sort of vegetarian type thing, like perhaps a platter, and he said he could actually design something for me - falafel on a bed of hummus. I thought of perhaps a little tabbouleh to go with it and he said it might not be able to do that, then ducked into the kitchen briefly - seconds later he reappeared with another dude and they both greenlighted the tabbouleh. The dolmas could have been part of my meal too, but I was advised that these are made to order and I figured I didn't need them that bad. We went with a custom order of falafel, tabbouleh and hummus. Ninos also asked if I liked eggplant, then said he could offer me a small sample of eggplant and potato on the house, which I gratefully accepted.  Finally, while I was waiting, Ninos offered me a bowl of lentil soup. At this point, despite the fact that I'm not really into soup (especially in the Phoenix summertime) I mentally raised my rating of Good Fellas to 4 stars. The soup was hot as hell, and not too bad (as lentil soups go). Seems to me that it's more of a wintertime dish, but I'm no soup connoisseur.  Several other people started arriving at the lunch hour and then my food was ready. Ninos opened the container to show me. A standard flat square takeout container with the main course, and a housebrick-sized one with tabbouleh (which was pretty much enough tabbouleh to feed at least four people - way more than I was after). Main here (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CV0knwCFA-x-8jJHot6Few?select=VXmx9i2VaxpYwg5k795Tmg), tabbouleh here (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CV0knwCFA-x-8jJHot6Few?select=iTuZQ7AB-acpYIbdxaFCrA).  The total price came to just over $16. Later on, mulling over this fact is what reduced my final rating. Very much overpriced for what I was after - double my typical lunch cost.  Taste-wise: the hummus was very nice and creamy, better than most I've had. The falafels, as you can see from the photo, looked like mini donuts. Strange, but also very nice - did not taste like the store-mix stuff (reminiscent of wet beach sand) that you find in falafels from places like Chicago Gyros or JT Gyros. Tabbouleh was good, but there was simply too much of it. This was supposed to be lunch for one person; I had to discard more than 3/4 of the T. Finally, the eggplant and potato was nice and reminded me of the ep/spicy potato/tzatziki/lettuce/tomato/cheese kebabs that I used to get from Saidoun in North Sydney Shoppingworld's food court. Back when it existed, that is.  The price was somewhat my fault, I suppose, for not ordering directly from the menu nor indicating my desired quantity. Breaking it down: Greek Wraps give you two falafels for a buck; six would have been three bucks. Hummus; I can get almost double the amount for about $3.99 from Fry's, albeit perhaps not as fresh. Tabbouleh is cilantro, parsley, bulgur wheat and a coupla other cheap things. I would have been happy with far less of it and a price of perhaps $8-9 all up. Ninos rang up several items on the register so I think he may have believed that I got multiple full-size entrees items but my photos show what I received (minus the eggplant).  Whatever. I'll return for sure and next time I'll bring a few workmates. Props to Ninos for being personable and willing to cater for his customers, and for the above average flavor of the food. And thanks to Google I now know why the falafels are shaped like donuts - to prevent getting mealy in the middle. Neat idea. I'll try a meat dish next time; there could well be a fourth star yet in Good Fellas' future..

Wow. It's not often I give a place less than three stars unless I had a real bad experience there, like shit service, huge wait or a cockroach in the pudding. In this case, I'll make a unique exception because I encountered none of those. Confused? Read on.  The wife went here last night and grabbed dinner on the way to meet me and the kid. It's. Just. Chicken. Strips. HOW can you make any sort of chain restaurant based on that? It's bland and literally the most boring meal I've ever had. Just one (SMALL) step up from a glass of water in flavor. Let's break it down: tasteless chicken with breading that makes even Church's, arguably the blandest food in the state, taste passable; shoestring crinkle-cut fries - like Del Taco's but half as thick (why?!); boring coleslaw; boring sauce. Probably the tastiest thing in the box was the soft buttered toast, but hell if I can't make that myself at home, right? It's just so absolutely pointless to go to this place. Go ANYwhere else. Mexican, burger, whatever. I'd rather eat airline food, seriously. I felt like I needed to dip the damn chicken in sulfuric acid in the desperate hope that that could revive my clinically dead tastebuds five minutes into the meal. And chicken strips are ALL they had on the menu, with the sides as mentioned above! I was still vaguely hungry but quit eating my Caniac with half the meal to go, it was THAT un-special. Chick Fil-A is a dozen orders of magnitude better than this place. At least ~they~ have some sort of flavour. Making different kinds of breading available and giving the option for dark (== flavour) meat chicken would go a long way towards getting this place an extra star. Making three, in case you aren't counting. I appreciated the high-rating reviews I read prior to going here - additional reviews from those reviewers will help me profile restaurants I will NEVER eat at and save me a crapload of angst and cash in the future. But take your kids here. They'll love it. It's why I gave it one more star than I was planning to.  About a pound of half-eaten meal went into the trash last night. Won't ever happen again. Wife, it wasn't your fault, it was mine. And Yelp's. (presses period key on keyboard at the end of that sentence so hard that the plastic splits)

I love this place. It reminds me, just a little, of my youth - long ago and many thousands of miles away. I used to frequent a place called the Gardenia Cafe (which can be seen here - http://j.mp/Uq9EJv) back in the early 80's. In Oz, it's pretty normal to get what we call hamburgers with "the lot" or "the works" - a fried egg, beetroot (sweet pickled beet in the US) and often a slice of pineapple too, resulting in something roughly the size of a Burger King Double Whopper. Soft, greasy and absolutely delicious. While Jim's Burgers and Eggs doesn't produce exactly the same style of burger, they came close enough to bring back a few memories for me. Place your order at the counter, its all fried up to order and greasy fresh when laid in front of you. As Robert Crumb's Cheesis K. Reist would say, "Hot 'n hearty 'n plump as ya please!"  Red Robin advertises their "royal" burger with a fried egg, like it's something that royalty would eat, but I grew up with such a thing and I challenge anyone to make a burger at home, throw an over-medium egg on and truthfully say that it's not a perfect ingredient.  The double egg burger is by far and away my favourite. It's a double cheese burger with a single egg, but their thousand island dressing adds, quite unexpectedly, a delicious something extra. Get it "Jimmynized" and you get fries and a drink too. The fries are okay, I guess, sort of like Ore Ida and not my preference, but then again I much prefer soft British fries (http://j.mp/UqbDh0) instead. Which I don't even think you can get in the US.  Jim's has a huge menu to choose from - pretty much everything from pastrami to omelettes to Greek stuff to burgers and way beyond. Something for everyone. A large dining area, too. Unpretentious and sparsely decorated, but who cares? Your meals are made to order, so they do take a little while to be prepared. If you're dining in, just go sit at a table and they'll bring it out a la Paradise Bakery. I've never had to wait more than about 10 mins. Very glad that such a place opened in Surprise - way better than Red Robin - and once you're done eating you can have a great time peoplewatching! (I'd rank it second in Surprise for that, next to Chipotle). I sure hope this place doesn't shrivel and die like so many other decent Surprise restaurants.

Update 20150430: I dropped these idiots down two stars. Lesson to be learned, guys: if you want people to continue to like your FB page, don't delete their comments on your posts for absolutely no reason. And quit posting duplicate images there, nobody wants to see the same burger photo every single week. You want to manipulate social media, no prob, enjoy the result.  -- original review follows --- Still four stars and still the best burgers in Surprise (in fact quite probably the entire West Side, although admittedly I haven't actually eaten at ALL the burger joints on the WS). However, there are a couple of disappointing aspects. Firstly, I tend to agree about the front-desk woman. Sometimes (RARELY) she has good days and has had a friendly comment for me in the past. But if there's more than one person in line she doesn't handle it well, just wants to get your order and get you out of her face. Your best bet is to prepare your order in your mind well before you get to the counter and then just clearly state it to her without asking any questions. Ask anything and she'll tire of you real quick. Other server girls are fine. Except for the one dunce that looked at me weirdly when I asked for water, then when departing my table area promptly bumped her shoulder right into the corner of a wall and went "Ow!" Her face was sour as a lemon's @rse for the rest of the time we were in there.  They are now just filling glasses of water and leaving them on the front counter just to the left of where you order. If you want water and are dining in, don't forget to grab a cup on your way to a table.  This place REALLY needs to throw away their mustard and ketchup bottles and get new ones. They're evidently the same bottles, possibly never washed or wiped but refilled a thousand times since they first opened. The mustard bottles are dingy. The ketchup bottles look like props from a Ron Jeremy flick. There's no reason why they can't simply get proper, clean squirt bottles for the tables and have some sort of semblance of cleanliness - I feel like I want to wash my hands after every time I touch those things. I would normally give this place a flat three, but it still keeps its quad-star rating based purely on the taste of the food, everything I've had here or seen others have here looks and tastes all-world. The main guy knows what he's doing and it's all out quickly and efficiently. And you can tell the cuisine is good by how busy the place gets at mealtimes.  They've had this same sign on the tables for months now, something about a "coming soon" promotion from Limelight Networks that will allow them to advertise local businesses. Hasn't happened yet, dunno what that's all about. Finally, I'd suggest that this place quit doing their ridiculous car shows every so often and jamming up the parking lot with what appear to be clunkers salvaged straight out of Bubba's Wrecking Yard. Burgers have nothing to do with cars. Neither does yogurt. That yogurt place down by Reems and Greenway did car shows and we all know what happened to them, eh?  Anyway. GO EAT AT JIM'S. And always remember, deliver your order slowly and clearly to counter lady. Questions or small talk carry a risk.

After seeing the 5 star reviews on Yelp and having driven past on numerous occasions en route to Pho Thanh or Maxim, the boss and I decided to head here for lunch today. I was in the middle of a conversation with the boss as I walked in, and I guess I was expecting Jerk Hut to be a regular (if small) place with tables and table service. So when I came face to face with the lady behind the counter immediately upon entry I was speechless for a second or two until I got my bearings, since I was GOING to ask for a table for two *8-) It's basically structured like a take-out joint, with a small counter, two small high-tops and a long communal dining bench set facing the south wall. Which is fine. When you order, your food is scooped into a take-out styrofoam container. Today I went for the ox-tail, with plantains and rice and peas.  And it was DELICIOUS.  I love the fact that the food is ready right then and there, and that you don't have to sit around twiddling your thumbs before your stuff is ready. It also means that if you're still hungry you can just reach over and pay for another helping of rice or whatever you need. I completely agree with the other reviewers - the food's delicious, and the boss and I resolved to return several times and go down the menu, tasting each different thing. This time round, he had the jerk chicken and loved it. My oxtail brought back memories of me as a child, using my incisors to grate off the knuckle cartilage of each tailbone before sucking out the spinal cord. I had the rice w/peas (black-eyed) and the fried plantains. Marie, the owner, came to talk to us when we were just about done, which was very welcome. She said she's making do with the space and location she has. Considering how flavourful and "niche" the food is, this place deserves to do very well.  I'll DEFINITELY be back, and quite soon too.  In fact, I almost feel like returning tonight for dinner! Up next: goat curry and "bammy". I'd have given this my usual 3 ranking, but decided on 4 because it's reasonably unique, the food really is delicious and the owner is super friendly. Bit cramped, but that's life.

We've been regulars at Jump Street for a year or two now, and after reading some of the Yelp reviews drawing comparisons between there and Skyzone, I figured we'd come on down and check out the opposition. BOY am I glad we did! My usual book-length review follows.  I checked out the website online, a couple of hours before we went, and there is a waiver that you can either print out and sign, or else sign as a web form. I did the latter, which was fairly quick. Skyzone is a little closer to us than Jump Street. The place is very large indeed. There's an separate stand at which you can sign waivers (as opposed to doing it at the counter, like Jump Street, and holding up the queue in the process), but we hit the counter directly and hooray, our online-signed waiver was in their system. Like a bowling alley, they have you wear special shoes to jump. I like this idea - the shoes were used but clean, and can be laced tight to protect ankles while jumping. Some Jump Street reviews claim this place "smells cleaner". I didn't smell a difference, honestly, but clean(er) shoe soles all day, versus bacteria-ridden sweaty feet and socks on the equipment is perhaps a little more sanitary, especially for small jumpers who will roll and faceplant on the surfaces.  So, first up: the foam pit. There are five lanes to Skyzone's pit, versus Jump Street's two. More or less the same size rectangle, and same type of foam squares though. But the lanes are subdivided by padding into two squares each, which you'll see in the photos. While one jumper heads down to the pit, the other jumper can "queue up" on the initial square. From there we went down a few stairs to the basketball court. These are two regular trampoline lanes with hoops at the end - one lower than the other. My kid, who is a powerball of energy, spent most of his time here.. and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm talking twenty, thirty minutes just shooting hoops.  On the other side of the space is an enormous "main court". This area is all subdivided into jumping squares with a waffle pattern of soft padding. There are three small lanes in the middle for those showoff gymnastics girls that always seem to frequent these places, but the rest of it is for Q*Bert-style free jumping. Rules are to simply stay in your own square, moving to others as long as they aren't occupied. The main court is open age too - jumpers are encouraged to remain in the same vague quadrant as jumpers of similar size. I was impressed with the 'court marshal'; she was on the ball and making sure that kids didn't co-occupy jump squares, and that they didn't lie or sit down to rest while in the jumping area. Rules are clearly and prominently displayed in every section - front flips only in the foam pit, resting on the sidelines rather than in the jump area etc. And the monitors did a great job. The foam pit guy had his attention on the basketball lanes behind him as well, making sure that there was only one person per lane at any time etc. At Jump Street, all the foam pit attendants do is tell a kid when they can head down the lane to the pit.. and chew gum.  So, from the main court, back to the foam pits, basketball hoops and foam pit again. A new game was designed - build a stack of foam bricks right at the end of the lane, run back to the start, and have me pretend to "bowl" my kid down the lane to tumble over the blocks like a human bowling ball and into the pit. Each zone has a prominent clock so people know what time it is and how long they have to go. I didn't see anything like this at Jump Street.  In one two hour frenzy, this place has rocketed to my kid's number 1 favourite play area.  Kids were chatting to me, amongst themselves, showing off, everyone seemed to be having a freakin' fantastic time. Nobody was being an @ss, and the marshals would have completely nipped that in the bud had they seen it - they were completely unlike the lackadaisical Jump Street staff. The froyo cafe in the middle was the perfect end to the session - with milk chocolate, peach, regular vanilla and strawberry milkshake yo flavors on offer, about twenty toppings, plus other stuff like pizza and of course bottles of water. No need to go to Freddie's Frozen Custard afterward, in other words. I have absolutely NEVER seen this much energy expended by the child over this sort of timeframe before - not during soccer matches or bouncy-castle birthday parties and certainly not at Jump Street. During play, my kid told me "I LOVE this place; I want to stay here for ever!" I'm completely converted. I can't fault Skyzone for anything. Valpak has a coupon, two hours for the price of one. Glad we did that. No matter how energetic your kid, after two hours at this place their batteries will be near zero. Best twelve bucks I've spent on my kid to date. Five rosy-faced, sweat-soaked, smiling, out-of-breath stars.

Really good Mediterranean food here. I have to say, I'm absolutely addicted to their garlic sauce. It's just amazing. I usually get two containers of it and then just drench every single mouthful in it. I actually went and asked the lady at the counter if she could share the recipe and she said it was a secret.. bah! Whatever dish you get here, trust me, get some of this magic pink garlic sauce - you won't regret it. Apart from that I usually get the beef or chicken. I'd vote this place second best Greek in Phoenix, with Greek Wraps coming out well in in front like they always do. I'd usually give a place I really like 3 stars, but Pita Kitchen gets a fourth for the garlic sauce. It is THAT good.

Ugh. I've never eaten at a Federico's, Rodiberto's, Pinocchio's or any other O's before and this was the last time I'll ever do it. Came back late from Anthem and didn't feel like cooking - this place is brand new, we've eaten at just about every Surprise food establishment and against my better judgement I suggested that we give it a shot for proverbials and giggles. The food was just DISGUSTING. I got a burrito and cheese enchilada combo and had to photograph it halfway through. Here's the pic (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Lhaj-hGoMgw70_vbFW9a9Q?select=nHDw95uHdll5qMAp3RY19A). After bringing the "meal" home (we live a mile away) the burrito tortilla was almost completely cold and I'm 100% convinced it was store bought. No doubt about it. Leathery and foul, like eating something directly out of the packet from Frys. After pulling it apart to remove the green peppers I noticed that there was maybe two tablespoons' worth of shredded beef in there, barely enough to fill a taco let alone a burrito. I had three bites of the thing before discarding it and almost retching - the entire experience was like mowing down on a spandex shirt that someone had just worked out in. The enchilada containment space looked like the locker room scene from the movie "Carrie" - see photo for proof. Rice was okay. Beans were okay, but pureed to the consistency of mashed potatoes. Barely any flavour at all. The wife's mileage was the same - she flung her carne asshola burrito after a single bite and wound up pouring a bowl of cereal for dinner. I tentatively bit into the kid's cheese quesadilla and almost couldn't strangle it down. We didn't need another Mexican restaurant in Phoenix and certainly not in Surprise. I hope this place goes down the gurgler in short order. A rare single star from me.

Absolutely unimpressive place. Came here due to the myriad of 5-star reviews. Drove twice around the carpark before realising this place is literally INSIDE the Lee Lee market, and there is NO sign, not even a sandwich board, indicating this on the outside! Went in and got seated immediately. Water brought out quick. Orders taken and served quick. That's where the delight ended. They didn't have the fresh coconut that I normally get so that was disappointing.  My "large" pho was ok, but I wouldn't classify it as a large. Maybe a medium. Broth tasted ok. Hardly any of the sliced beef balls or tripe, or in fact much meat at all. Small handful of bean sprouts and a single tiny lime slice provided. My kid had the crepe with bean sprouts, shrimp and pork. Yuck. I had some - the crepe tasted bland and ten minutes later, cold (my kid tried his best to delay actually eating any, can't blame him), I wouldn't have served it to a dog. Wife thought her vermicelli and BBQ pork was okay and liked the "fresh" taste, but thank god the fish sauce was on the side. Ugh. Absolutely NO table service after we'd started, not even offers to refill water. Had to get up and walk around to the tiny cash register to pay. Got back to table and sat down to wait for the kid to strangle down another couple of bites and that's when I had an ice water jug held in front of me as a refill offer. Nope, done.  This place is nowhere near as efficient or generous with their portions as either Pho Thanh (Camelback) or Da Vang (19th Ave). Those who think the prices are cheap need to understand that those prices are normal for a viet place. They're all this cheap, except the ridiculously-overpriced Rice Paper on 7th Ave. Go to Pho Thanh (http://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-thanh-phoenix), order the large pho dac biet for $6.75 and run a comparison of what you get.  I wouldn't go back here.

Bought a 2nd hand 20" mountain bike for five bucks (!) from someone on Craigslist a couple weeks ago. It actually wasn't in horrible condition but regardless, I planned to have it looked at, tweaked, greased etc before releasing the six-year-old on it. I honestly didn't know that Build-A-Bike was in Surprise and was planning to arrange a service at Performance Bike on Thunderbird, but the wife pointed out that there was a bike shop that she'd seen from the road "behind Kohls". At the time they weren't showing on Yelp so I submitted the business entry and voila, here I am with the first review.  Took the bike in today and boy, what a great experience! Tyler greeted me as soon as I walked in and immediately took my bike to a service area in the corner. While I waited and chatted with him, he fitted a new colored chain, a bell, grips and replaced the rusty old kickstand. Service was done in no more than 20 mins, and for a cost well under what I was expecting! I normally give three stars for places I like and very rarely give four. This place gets five - friendly, efficient, the store is clean, and they look to have a good selection of bikes and parts, and extremely reasonably priced for service. I literally can't think of anything else that I'd expect from a bike store. Well worth anyone's business!

I'm a BIG fan of this place. It's basically like a Subway except for pizzas (they have salads too - whatever). Only one size crust, but from that point you can choose precisely what you want on the pizza, from several sauces, several different kinds of cheese (fontina, fresh or regular mozzarella, more), about ten different meats and plenty of different veggies including caramelized or raw onions, artichoke, black or kalamata olives. You can have them load your pizza with as many or few toppings as you like, they artfully arrange the items on top of the pizza base for you and then once you're done ordering they fling it in their giant oven and it's ready in generally about five minutes. The pizzas I've had them build are usually delicious, but unfortunately the last time I was there they slightly burned the crust. My one minor complaint only has to do with how absolutely NUTS popular this place is. A couple of us walked down at just after 11am to see if we could beat the lunch rush. 11:10am, there were about 20 people already in line. In the 15 mins that it took to get to the end of the line, order and have our pizzas in the oven, enough people had arrived that the line was out the freakin' door. Fired Pie just has an absolutely winning formula; long as they get the bake timing right the pizzas are fantastic and for a great price. They need a second oven though. Desperately.  A rare 4 stars from me.

Have been here on two occasions and each time the smoothie we got was almost completely unpalatable. This last time we went there and the kid got a "health nut" shake. He tasted it and screwed up his face (and my 8-year-old can stomach some pretty unusual stuff). Then we tasted it. It was like a thick shake made out of chalk, with chunks so large that they jammed in the straw and we needed to use a spoon for it. I don't know if the items here are an acquired taste or not, but we didn't acquire it and likely never will. Unfortunately this is the last time for us - at least Smoothie King has some semblance of flavour in their product. We're somewhat health conscious (came here after a gym workout), but not to this extent.

The employees here CONSTANTLY jack up orders. This is the third time they've screwed up - which means they're not only getting their receipt survey done but it's finally time for a Yelp review. Each time, no matter how clearly you tell them what you want, something is inevitably wrong, either with the order or with the food quality. For example, today I ordered a #13 (ham/grilled cheese sandwich with hash browns), 4 wake up wraps (I made CERTAIN to tell the girl that they were egg and cheese only, and I checked that that was reflected on the receipt), a maple bar and a donut. The only thing they got right was the donut. When I checked my bag they had forgotten the hash browns. I went back to the servery counter and told the guy, he was like "what did you order?". I'm like number 13. He squints at the monitor then makes it for me. Meanwhile my kid has gone into the rest of the order to start eating one of his wake up wraps and sure as shit it's got ham in it. EGG. AND. CHEESE. ONLY!!!!!!! My kid didn't care since he was pretty hungry and by this time I was already mentally forming this review and left rather than bothering to once again go back to the counter and ask them to take out the damn ham although I was sorely tempted. The donut was fine. The maple long john was stale. We've had fresh ones from there before - this one wasn't fresh.  In the past they've proved substandard in other ways. Example, we bought a bottle of milk once, and when we sat down to eat we noticed that it was out of code. Took it back to the counter, whereupon one of the employees at that point went to the drink fridge and realised that other bottles in there were also out of code. Seriously?? The employee was all chuckles and "wow" and joking with the other staff behind the counter as they removed the bad stock from the fridge.  It's gotten to the point that I actually EXPECT something to be wrong with the order, or that the employee I'm talking to won't have a clue how to ring up particular items. Example: I asked for a grilled cheese sandwich once. They clearly list that item as as "Texas toast grilled cheese" on their menu. The employee kept asking if I wanted ham or bacon then couldn't seem to punch in an order for a ham and cheese then remove the ham. Someone else had to tell them that it's actually a separate item. Other times I've been there to hear an apparently senior staff member talking to the others LOUD like they were ghetto trash. I don't know what sort of employee turnover this place has but there's been almost nobody here in my five or so visits that has seemed to know everything they should. Last time I was in, I asked for a maple bar. They're like.. we don't have any left, but we do have maple long johns. Wow - just.. wow.  I'm starting this tragedy of a place on 2 stars with my first review. I quite literally never thought I would find a fast food place that consistently messes up orders as bad as the McDonalds in Surprise next to the Sam's Club, but this place proved me wrong. The only reason I'll come back is because my wife and kid like it so much, but the very next time that my order is screwed up the White Star Line's going to get a strongly worded letter (if you understand what I'm saying), my Yelp rating of it goes down to a single star and it'll be my absolute last visit. Screw this place, bring on the sit-down Dutch Bros stores.  Edit: The final chuckle here - I go on telldunkin.com to start the survey and get a warning that the SSL cert on the site is invalid - issued by "Trusted Secure Certificate Authority 5" and using obsolete encryption. It truly doesn't surprise me - just another confidence-inspiring experience at Dunkin.

Aand we're down to one star. Went back here this morning. Predicted that I would have problems ordering and I sure wasn't disappointed, at least in terms of the prediction coming true. Once again, the Texas Toast Grilled Cheese proved to be a problem of Gordian proportions for the counter staff. The girl had to turn to the guy behind her and ask how to punch it in on the console. He then (predictably) leaned over and asked me if I wanted ham or bacon. I pointed at the Sandwich menu overhead, where the item I was asking for was fourth from the bottom. Both of them, predictably, had the equivalent of a division-by-zero error written all over their faces until they figured out that the item evidently required more than one keypress to achieve. I continued delivering my order, which included a maple long john. Order rang up, the girl turns around to collect my donuts and - PREDICTABLY - there are no maple long johns. She goes round the back, then predictably returns and tells me I'm going to be incredibly disappointed but there were.. "No maple long johns? I'll take a maple donut instead," I had my response already prepared. Guy behind her hands her a maple donut for me. "Phew" she says. "That was a relief, wasn't it?" I shit you not. And during the time this was happening, the guy ordering next to me was directing his counter attendant to the actual shelf where the donut he wanted was located. "One shelf up, buddy.. yep. There it is." Because donuts are apparently nigh-on fucking invisible to just about everyone that works in the store.  The order, oddly enough, was correct when prepared and set out for me at the hot food counter - trust me, I checked. Something else to trust me on: I won't be returning.

ONCE AGAIN I go here because the wife and kid like it. ONCE AGAIN I order a meal that comes with both a sandwich and hashbrowns and ONCE AGAIN they fucking forget an item. I felt around in the bag to make sure that everything was in there but I get home and they've forgotten to put in my fucking hashbrowns. Why do I keep DOING this to myself? Do not order ANYTHING from here without doublechecking to make sure that they've given you every single item that you asked for. There is NO care at all paid to order accuracy. EVER. I absolutely fucking hate this place.

I wasn't impressed with this place. Going to a sushi joint, you always have to be prepared to pay through the nose but here the price simply wasn't worth it. Two and a half people, lunch, $65.10 - and that wasn't including the tip. The food wasn't all that great (RA Sushi in Old Town or Tokyo Lobby in Glendale are far better), but the prices here are just nuts. $12 for a rainbow roll - really? (Tokyo Lobby have them for $10). Even the nigiris are a half buck or more over what they should be charging. $5 for two small pieces of fish and let's face it, 80% of the damn thing is plain boiled rice. They even nickel and dimed us an extra dollar just because we switched one roll to soy paper from seaweed. And a tiny cup of green tea was $2.75.  Definitely not coming back, I'm afraid. I'd rather make the trip to Tokyo Lobby (which IS the best sushi in the West Valley IMO) where the food tastes better and the prices are more reasonable. I guarantee Uni won't survive in Surprise, not with prices like this and especially not in the cattycorner location they moved into, site of at least four or five other local restaurant failures.
