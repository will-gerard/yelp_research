Love this place! The staff is so friendly and the food is fantastic! We live about 4 miles away and it is definitely our go to Chinese place.

These guys are amazing! I have a 30+ year old VW that finding OEM glass for is nigh impossible. Seth was able to find it and have it installed ASAP. I have since used Scottsdale Auto Glass for all of my vehicles and not once have I been disappointed.

I've owned 3 VW's and Derek has worked on them all. He does great work, extremely fairly priced and he'll go the extra mile to get you back on the road. Exklusiv is the bee's knees.

Just ate there for lunch today and it was... decent. The Cod was pretty good, but the fries were awful. I had better Fish & Chips at TGI Friday's last week. Truth.

Awesome little hole in the wall. The sushi is good, although, some of the hot rolls were a little bit too cool. However, the service more than made up for it. Now that I know about it and its right down the street, it will be a staple!

Bryan has helped me on so many different occasions with electrical projects around the house. He wired up my air compressor, added outlets behind our TV in the master br and family room among other things. He is always on time, professional and get the job done quickly and correctly. I have called him on occasions with electrical questions and he has given me troubleshooting tips and suggestions before coming out to do a fix.

Lobby's is fantastic. I love the hamburger's and the french fries. Ask for a side of sauce to dip the fries in. I have yet to try anything on the menu except the burgers and the dog. I just can't get myself to order anything else because the burgers are so good.  Make sure to try this spot if you're in the area, its my go to joint when I'm at work and craving a hamburger!

It's not the best sushi in the world, but it's decent and you can eat until you're full and not spend a small fortune.

I'm going to echo pretty much what everyone else has said. The employees all seemed to have an attitude. Maybe it's a Philly thing and it's a part of their theme...?    The place is nice, however, half of the tables needed to be cleaned/wiped down from the last customer and it wasn't busy so... what's the excuse?  The food however was awful. I had the wings as did my wife and they were cold and tasted like the kind you buy in the frozen food section at your local supermarket and then heat up in the microwave... At least they would have been hot if I had done it that way. My son had a slice of cheese pizza which was absolutely gross. It looked like it had been sitting for a day and had zero flavor whatsoever in addition to being like cardboard.  Avoid.

I absolutely love PJ. Chicken Shawarma Pita with Feta Cheese is my jam. The Lavosh is amazing too.
