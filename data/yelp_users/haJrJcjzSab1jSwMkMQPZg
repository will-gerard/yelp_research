Alright Hookah Fans, If you like hookah XHALE IS by FAR the place to come to. First off the hookah is good and Cheap . the Owner is always there and continuously checking up on the customers who go in there. They also have a " AMI BAR LINK " witch is basically a modern day Juke box. and For those of you who have a CCW or like to open Carry that is allowed to unlike most other hookah lounges  in the City. The Employees are really nice and love to joke around. Exhale is also Pretty good Size so if you are looking to visit with .... say 12-15 of your friends you will have plenty of space to do so. Have I said enough is convince you yet ? It is in fact SUCH a GREAT Place to come smoke hookah the it is pretty much packed about an hour after the doors open, oh and did I mention OPEN 7 Days a Week ! Thats right , so go check them out Today !!!

This Place is pretty good , been to numerous hookah lounges around the valley.  This place earns a 2 star from me. 1 for hookah, and 1 for the pool tables . Everything else nope.

I'm a a frequent hookah smoker , I have a regular hookah lounge that I attend and help out at , but that's not the point right now.            I have been to many hookah lounges around the Metro -Phoenix area and decided to try this one out. I walked in and was greeted immediately with a smile and was seated appropriately.  The ambiance is great for groups , the place is small but quant. The staff is very friendly and always checking up on you constantly.  NOTES: - ice tips available $5.00 - 1 hose hookah 14.99  - 2 hose , $18.99 - Most flavors $14.99 EXCEPT: - Fumari = 16.99, House = $15.99  This is definitely worth coming to and the serve food as well . Highly recommended .

The staff is very friendly , it's a very quaint place too. Hookah is great . There is 1 single down side though. There is NO FOOD AVAILABLE . Other that that great place to come visit !!

This Place is Pretty cool, Been here a couple of times and really enjoy it. The atmosphere is good and they even have pool tables, a DJ, multiple TVs, and small amounts of munchies to keep you entertained. Great place for Groups! and the Owner who works there is very nice too! there is only one downfall hookah after 9:00pm is $15.00

I've been to fuzzy's multiple times on mill. And it it amazing, witch is why I drive from central PHX all the way to Mill Ave in Tempe for more. But I wanted to try out there new location on 44th st. And Thomas , guess what.... Still amazing and great customer service . They came up consistently  asking if they could get me anything or if I was enjoying my food. Either way , I recommend going to either location!!!! A++ in my book!
