This place is awesome. I work just down the street and a group of my coworkers go here every Thursday - they call it "Cheap Chinese Thursday." The food is INSANELY cheap - like, between $3 and $4 for lunch, and it's pretty good. The Lemon Chicken is my personal favorite, and I'd go every Thursday if not for the MSG headache. The egg rolls aren't good, though, but seriously, for $3, this place is pretty great. They also have a community table in the middle, which is cool since it's usually packed at lunch and you can usually grab a seat or two at the group table. And, oh yeah: CASH ONLY.

Hmm. I've been to Lalibela twice, both times for lunch, and had wildly different experiences. Now, I lived in Washington DC for a couple of years and developed a great love for Ethiopian food. DC has the world's second largest Ethiopian population (second only to Ethiopia) and the Ethiopian food there is divine.   So I was hesitant about Arizona Ethiopian food, and my first trip was not encouraging. I went for lunch with a friend and ordered the three-item lunch sampler. The food arrived right on the plate - no injera to soak up the saucy goodness! A little disconcerting. There was also rice, which I've never seen in an Ethiopian place. And then, the real crime: a FORK. I was given a FORK. Heresy! But while the presentation didn't seem all that authentic, the food was delicious.  The second time, though, also for lunch, was an entirely different experience. The food came atop injera on a big, round platter, the way I've always seen it done, and there were no forks! The food is amazing and I'll definitely be back, but man, I have to ding them a star for giving me a fork. Come on!

On my first trip to Thai Basil, I was lucky enough to try the green curry with tofu. Hands down, the best Thai dish I've ever had, and I've eaten a LOT of Thai food. Literally, I have dreams about this green curry. I can't attest to any other dishes, as I've only been twice and had the green curry both times. But, wow. It's perfect.

Trader Joe's is awesome for the following reasons: 1) Australian grass-fed steaks - $4!  2) bagged salad greens for $1.99 3) middle eastern flatbread - like $1.89 for a huge bag 4) white bean and basil hummus - YUM 5) the magic that happens when you combine all of the above 6) really good, really cheap frozen vegetables 7) TJ's greek yogurt in fig - i never leave with fewer than 10 of these.  Things that are not so great: 1) I am a sucker for grape tomatoes, and theirs are rarely good. small, flavorless. somehow dry. for these, I have to go to Costco, which has consistently fab grape tomatoes. 2) the organic avocados tend to not be great, and they are wildly expensive. or maybe they just seem expensive because everything else is like $2. avocados are my other must-buy-at-Costco item.  Clearly, Trader Joe's is awesome. my only real complaint about this TJ's is that it's pretty small, but i've heard a rumor that they're expanding this one. Hopefully they'll expand the parking lot along with it. 5 stars!

I am so in love with this place that words cannot do it justice. I've taken every out-of-town guest here, and they've all loved it. Tableside guacamole with pomegranate seeds: inspired. Seafood enchiladas: divine. You will probably have to wait, but it will be so worth it.

The food I had tonight at Efe's was so good that, even though I'm nowhere near hungry, I can't stop eating my leftovers.   My dinner companion and I started with the appetizer sampler, which consisted of hummus, baba ganoush, stuffed grape leaves, some wonderful eggplant something (patlican sousli, says the menu), and tabbouleh. Verdict: mixed. I hate tabbouleh so I was not impressed by that. Neither were the grape leaves great - I always think I'll like them but I almost never do. But the patlican sousli was delicious, the hummus was insanely garlicky and wonderful, and the baba ganoush was excellent too, though it did have some sort of hickory taste going on in the background that left me a little puzzled. i think next time I'll stick with just the hummus and the patlican sousli.   Our main courses were both, like, ridiculously good. I had the doner kabob, which was grilled steak with pita, rice with saffron and walnuts, and cabbage slaw - the steak was perfectly cooked and super flavorful. My companion had the garlic shrimp, which was just outstanding. Everything was seasoned perfectly and the yogurt sauce that came with my meal was divine: yogurt, garlic, mint. I want to start putting that sauce on everything i eat.   I'll so totally be back. Maybe tomorrow.

I just discovered the Cinemark in Mesa yesterday afternoon, when it was the only theater in the area that still had relatively last-minute opening night tickets for The Dark Knight available online. Tickets to the opening night 10:30 pm show still available at 4:30 that afternoon? Yes please! I didn't even know about this place but it's a perfectly fine theater and there's a ton of shopping around and seems cool.   The line-management for TDK was a little bit of a clusterf*ck but hey, it's opening night, there are people everywhere, I'm not mad. I'm sure I'll be back.

Blah. A friend of mine just moved to Mesa and we decided to try Thai House because a) it's close to his house and b) it got a rave review on Yelp. Well, it was not great.   We started out with the fried wontons (standard fried wontons with like 1/16th of a teaspoon of spiced ground chicken filling) and spring rolls, which were actually quite good despite the extreme stickiness of the wrappers. What really worried us, though, is that the appetizers came out about 30 seconds after we ordered them, which led us to worry that they'd been sitting around; I'm not always against pre-making food, but this place isn't busy enough to ensure rapid cycling.   For dinner, my friend ordered the red curry with chicken and I ordered the pineapple curry, which was red curry with (canned) pineapple and shrimp. Sure, we should have branched out but were just both feeling the red curry. The spiciness scale goes from 1-5 - I got a 2 and my dining companion got a 5 - I'm a total spiciness wuss and was happy with my 2, but my heat-loving friend wanted the 5 to be hotter. The curries were just okay. And maybe I'm just spoiled on Thai Basil's amazing curries, but I didn't find either curry to be all that impressive.  Furthermore, the place is SUPER tiny, which is fine, but the layout means that you're practically sitting in the laps of patrons at neighboring tables. Not fun.  So this place was fine, but nothing special. 3 stars. It's possible that the red curry just isn't that great and everything else is dynamite, but since the previous 5-star review said that the red curry was the best thing on the menu, I don't think I'll be back.

Oh my god, this place was abysmal.   My dinner partner and I had planned on going to Sushi Eye for happy hour last night, but after driving up and down Elliot 4 or 5 times without finding it and with the end of happy hour quickly approaching, we finally pulled into Kobe out of sheer desperation. Biggest mistake ever.   So, the hostess asks us whether we want sushi or teppan, and we say sushi. Then, sushi bar or table? We've got some talking to do, so we say table. Once we're seated at a table with menus, our eyes pop out of our heads when we see the sushi prices. Like, we're talking $8 spicy tuna rolls. So we ask the waiter whether there are any happy hour specials. He says, "Yes, but we only have happy hour at the sushi bar, not at the tables." Hmm, okay. So we move to the sushi bar and ask for a happy hour menu. The waiter says, "Oh, you mean happy hour sushi? I thought you meant drinks. At the sushi bar we only do happy hour drinks. If you want happy hour sushi, you have to sit at the main bar." So, we've been there for 3 minutes and moved twice. Not exactly auspicious beginnings.  It only got worse from there. There are two happy hour sushi specials: spicy tuna roll and california roll, both $3.25. We were starving so we ordered two of each, plus Kobe tofu and pork gyoza (both also on happy hour special for $3.25).   It was the worst sushi I've ever had, and I've had a lot of sushi. The california roll was horrendous. It was 95% imitation crab and mayonnaise, with teeny slivers of cucumber and brown avocado. The spicy tuna roll, though not as actively offensive as the california roll, was boring and mushy. The Kobe tofu was bland and had an oddly spiced dipping sauce - eating it was reminiscent of eating McDonald's chicken nuggets dipped in sweet and sour sauce. And not in a good way. The pork gyoza, though, was wonderful, though at $3.25 for 5 of them, it was not enough of a bargain to warrant a return trip.   And all, the while, since the place is (for whatever reason) really busy, we're stuck at the end of the bar, where we have to listen to the world's most obnoxious waitress prattle on to the bartender about how she's soooooo tired of all these women glaring at her because they think she's after their men, and how she wants to "get a t-shirt that says, "Honey, I'm not after what you've got because I've got my own stuff to deal with at home." Wow. Witty.   Anyway, this place is awful and I'll never be back. Luckily, we finally found Sushi Eye on the way home (hiding sneakily between a Quizno's and a Baja Fresh, if memory serves) and hopefully we'll have a more pleasant happy hour experience next week. Sigh.

So, you know, Claim Jumper is a chain and stuff. I never go here of my own volition but occasionally when a group of work people want to go, I tag along. The food has always been just okay. But THEN. Today, on a lark, I tried the veggie burger, and WOW, it was just amazing. I mean, amazing. It was a Boca burger topped with tomato, avocado, caramelized red onions, garlic mayo, and gouda, which I switched out for goat cheese. Seriously, this thing was heaven. My one complaint is that it was served on very heavily toasted toast, which I don't think the menu indicated, and I HATE sandwiches on toast. This one was delicious enough to make up for the toast thing, but next time I'll ask for it on a roll instead.   I could only eat half of this deliciousness and took the rest home in a box -  it came with a fairly large side salad for $9, which I considered to be a steal. I never thought I'd say this, but I can't wait to go back to Claim Jumper.

i LOVE this bar. i went to college in an old railroading town in rural illinois and i felt totally at home here. it is the perfect unintentional dive bar. when you walk in, you immediately get the feeling that everyone sitting at the bar knows each others' names, but you still feel welcome. the beer selection is limited (of course! the bartender had never heard of red stripe.) but man, the atmosphere makes up for it. LOVE IT.

So, I decided to check out Qdoba because I got a buy one get one free coupon in the mail - I ate one for dinner last night and saved the other for lunch today. I love Chipotle, so I had high hopes, but man, the food was terrible. i got 2 Naked Burritos - the equivalent of a Chipotle Burrito Bol - one with steak and one with shredded beef. The rice was undercooked - practically crunchy, the shredded beef had a weird aftertaste like it had been stored in plastic, and the rest of it (mild salsa, "sauteed vegetables," cheese, sour cream) was just so, so bland. I ate them both because I'd paid for them, but the whole time I wished I'd just gone to Chipotle. Sigh.

I'm always nervous about finding a dentist when I move to a new city, but when I moved to Phoenix, I was lucky enough to know someone here who loved her dentist, Dr. Beischel. I went in today for a consultation and seriously, everyone at this office is amazing. Lois, the front-desk person (is receptionist an acceptable term these days?), is one of those super-charming old ladies who prides herself on recognizing patients who only come in once a year. I don't remember the dental hygienist's name, but she was German and also awesome. But Dr. Beischel! This guy is top-notch! He's great-looking, first of all, which is a great feature for someone who spends the whole appointment about 3 inches from your face. He is green-eyed, as am I, so he also gets bonus points there. He's also genuinely funny (not just I-tell-the-same-jokes-all-day funny) and just nice as hell. He even complimented the work of my pediatric orthodontist (yay, Dr. Reynolds!). So, go see Dr. Beischel! He will take good care of your teeth, and charm you half to death in the process. Seriously. You'll get lost in his eyes.  ETA: I had two cavities filled by Dr. Beischel on Monday, and it was an entirely pleasant experience. I was in and out in like 45 minutes, and they even called me on Wednesday to make sure everything was feeling okay. I love these guys.
