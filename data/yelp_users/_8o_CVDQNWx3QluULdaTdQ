I have lived in Tempe for 20 years and frequented Paul's for many of those.  The other night I had less-than-stellar customer service at the store location.  That said, within 2 hours of voicing my disappointment about the establishment, I was contacted by a family member who owns it.  She not only tried to make up for the issue, she really seemed to understand the importance of putting the customer first.    I thought some of the store personnel lacked in their customer service, and that is something I hate to see in a locally-owned business.  I like to frequent Paul's and others over the big boxes, but if the service isn't there, it makes it seem just on-par with the national guys.  I can say after this experience that this is a store with local roots that still treats its local customers well, and they quickly make up for any shortcomings.    Amazingly enough, they also seem to have a great selection of just about everything I'd expect in a hardware store -- despite the fact the location is small in comparison to a Home Depot.   Sometimes smaller is better, and in this case I'm convinced that's the case.  I'm glad to have Paul's as part of the neighborhood!

Broadmor is a true asset to north Tempe and the community at large. It is inclusive, diverse, welcoming, accepting and fun, while still maintaining academic integrity. While I don't remember everything about my own elementary school experience, I know it was nothing like that provided at Broadmor. From the on-site, student and volunteer run garden to the impressive library, from the fall festival and spring Hoodstock events to regular field days and even a visit from members of the Ironman Foundation, Broadmor continues to deliver a great experience to its students and serves as a place where enduring friendships are made. The teachers, administrators and staff are an amazing group of individuals who all really seem to care about each students and his/her success.

What a disappointment.  We had clients in town and had reserved a space on the patio.  We spoke with the manager 10 minutes before arriving and all was well.  When we arrived, no space was reserved and minimal effort was made to accommodate us.  We stood around the outside bar and waited for an eternity to be served by a bartender who seemed like he'd rather be doing anything else.  Plus, the patio is right next to the trash and grease trap -- nice smell.  The food's OK, the service is among the worst I have encountered.

Accurate installed a Trane A/C unit at our house and it has required quite a bit of service over its first 2 years.  Recently, the thermostat broke and needed to be replaced -- of course on a 107 degree Saturday.  We had the technician come out and he told us that they do not carry the part with them and that Accurate does not provide access to the part over the weekend.  He wanted to put on a temporary thermostat but made it clear that he had no idea if it would work.  Given the fact the 2-year old unit has broken twice already and we had no idea if it would void the warranty, we decided that was a bad idea.  We paid him $146 for this call.    We then called another provider who stocks the part (yes, even on weekends and after hours) and we got it replaced a few hours later, no hassles.  I do not understand how an authorized service agent of Trane does not stock parts over the weekend, particularly when we are talking AC during June in Phoenix.  As an aside, Accurate did call 4 days later, but not to try to resolve our issue but instead to make sure their technician followed the protocol of the company, which I guess he did.    So, I'd say if you want quick service and expert repair, steer clear of Accurate.

My family frequents Rosita's and I can see why it's been a Tempe staple for so many years.  The chips and salsa are excellent and worth the trip alone.  I always get a black bean burrito enchilada style and it is the best black bean burrito in town.  The servers are really attentive and friendly as well.  I notice that many people seem to think it's overpriced, but I don't agree.  You can get a cheese crisp at happy hour (which is all day Sat/Sun) for $2.50.  My burrito on the lunch menu is around $6, less than most other similar places.  I do agree that the bathrooms are not the best, but I don't pass up good places simply because of the bathroom.  I'd miss many great dives in larger cities if I did that.  Overall, I think you'll be happy with your meal and the service provided at Rosita's.

We try to support local business but in this case it backfired. Took a pretty basic framing job to artarama and spent a good amount of time providing instructions. When it came time to pick it up, it was not ready. In fact they finally delivered it a week after they committed. But that was only the first problem...despite all of the instructions the matting was done incorrectly with a wrong color and a wrong style. Now back at square one. I would not recommend Jerrys Artarama if you want quality and value your time.

Ugghh. The service makes for an unpleasant experience. Delivered food with no silverware. We had to ask for drink refills, butter, mustard. You name it.. Server was nice enough but just not at all present, so everything was very, very slow.  On the good side, my kid liked the gravy.

We have used Pet Butler for nearly a year now to clean our dog run and I've got to say the service is impeccable.  I will readily admit we don't clean our own dog's poop.  Having someone else come without fail to do that for us is well worth the price.  And frankly they do a much better job of it than we ever did.  I would highly recommend outsourcing this not-so-fun chore and, if you do, would also highly recommend Pet Butler.  We used to be with Poopy Do (another company) and can without question say that Pet Butler does a much better job keeping its commitment to schedule.  And Mandi, your record for the most use of the word "poop" in one review remains intact.

We had a great time here. Liked the flight of 5 wines for $10.  Not the top wines around but what do you expect for the very reasonable prices.  Definitely thought the staff was extremely attentive and made it fun for us to hang out a few hours.

We went to The Mission on New Year's Eve in advance of a wedding and had a great time.  It's in Old Town Scottsdale in an older building that they have updated.  Has a great feel inside and a nice patio in the front.  I'm not reviewing that though.  Almost every dish we had was fantastic.  We decided to share a bunch of appetizers and entrees among us and the standouts were the Grits (yes, the grits) and the Corn as appetizers.  For entrees, the Chicken was delicious as were all of the tacos.    The service was very friendly and efficient too.  Highly recommend this place.

From my perspective, this place is as good as it gets.  No menu here, although I'm sure they already know based on available ingredients what will be prepared for the evening.  Instead, you select what you don't or can't eat from a list and then are surprised by what comes out.  While this is somewhat foreign to a dining experience, we had fun with it, learning in the process that 2 ingredients we thought we didn't like were actually delicious given the preparation.  We both selected 5 courses (you select from 4-7 I believe) and it was plenty of food.  Servings are small but almost all of ours were delicious.  I had 2 fish dishes and enjoyed both, but the highlight was a deconstructed key lime pie for dessert.    I'm not going to go on about ingredients in every dish and pretend to be the food critic I am not; rather, if you want a nice atmosphere, great service and outstanding food based on what you like and how you like things prepared, this place delivers.

I run alot and, as a result, had a few nagging injuries that I just didn't seem to stretch enough on my own.  Apex has helped me tremendously, specifically in stretching my hamstring and calf muscles.  I've learned some simple stretches to do on my own and have appointments regularly.  I largely credit my ability to continue running pain-free to the stretching regimen I employ through Apex.  I would highly recommend anyone, athlete or not, to Apex and would be shocked if you don't feel you get much beyond your money's worth.

For video and digital photography, Mark & Diane at SnapFactory are great to work with.  We have used them for two projects and were extremely pleased each time.  I would highly recommend them for your projects as they are both professional and knowledgeable experts in their field.

This place is great.  They have the best veggie burger - yes veggie burger - that I have probably ever had.  It is spinach based and has chopped jalapenos in it for some kick.  When I buy an entree, my kid eats for free.  So not only is the food good but it's very fairly priced as well.    And much better than the regular Big Fat Greek Restaurants around town.

I really had high hopes going into our dinner at Beckett's Table. In the end, though, I left quite underwhelmed.   The food, pretty much all of it, is good enough but nothing I will remember tomorrow. My wife had the steamed white bass, the clear winner at the table. The short ribs, pork stew and vegetable plate were all passable, nothing more. The mussels were downright bad and were returned because they both smelled and tasted like they should have been thrown out a few days prior.  We shared three appetizers among the 8 of us and none stood out. So much so I honestly can't remember what one of them was an hour later. Pass on the desserts -- both the coconut cake and the death by chocolate cake were dry and lacked any real flavor.  Perhaps the oddest part of the meal was the service. Our server must have been a politician in a past life -- no real answers to any questions asked. If you ask which entree is better, A or B, you get a dissertation about how each is prepared and the fact that salmon has good Omega-3's. Not really what we were looking for. When we returned the mussels, we were told they were going to be "retired" from the menu for the evening, yet we saw no less than 4 orders go out afterward.   The atmosphere of the restaurant itself was great. It seemed friendly and casual and is appropriate for families. The patio is nice and large with a great fireplace. I also liked the open kitchen. Unfortunately those attributes do not make up for so-so food and odd service, so we'll likely only return if we get a craving for white bass.

Went to ncounter for breakfast and thought it was top-notch.  Great selection of breakfast favorites like pancakes, eggs, omelettes, muffins, etc., but also some things that are harder to find.  For instance, my wife had the croque monsieur and loved it.  The location is right next to the light rail stop and the inside has been redone completely.  It looks nothing like the coffee shop that last inhabited the space (and that is definitely a good thing).    Flavored iced teas are good, as is the orange juice.  I'm really looking forward to going back for lunch, as the sandwiches sound like they'll be as great as the breakfast was.  Give this place a try!

My wife and daughter like the cheesesteaks, so I wish I liked the sandwiches. Bottom line, the hoagie rolls are stale and gross here, so a cold turkey sandwich is destined for mediocrity. I guess on the positive side it keeps me from eating bread, but to me that's one of the key components of a sandwich done right. Genos doesn't get it right.

I'm apparently a huge crepe lover, at least if they come from this place. When a friend suggested we get together for lunch at this restaurant, I begrudgingly accepted, thinking I'd end up with some small plate that would leave me hungry an hour or two later. I was incredibly wrong to cast any doubt on his recommendation. I got a turkey crepe that was both delicious and filling. In addition, we had the chance to try their vegan cereal which was just about one of the best cereals I have ever tasted (and as you can tell by the turkey crepe, I am not vegan). Even the iced tea was delicious and far, far above average.   If you question going out to eat crepes, stop right now. This restaurant is an amazing option for an area of town underserved by good restaurants. The staff is very attentive and, more importantly, friendly. I will most certainly go back and recommend you make a special trip even if it's out of your way. It is well worth it.

Well, we got our clothes back - I suppose that is deserving of at least one star. And they were reasonably pressed and looked acceptable. Unfortunately, whoever staples those numbered pieces of paper through the button holes of shirts is a bit overzealous on his or her stapling. Of the 10 shirts left, 4 had multiple staples actually stapled through the shirt fabric. I've actually never had this happen anywhere else in all the years I've been using cleaners. This might not seem like much of a deal until you go to pull the paper off and actually rip the shirt in the process. Stick to your iron and water or find another cleaner that pays more attention to detail.

We have been here three times in the short time it's been open, all for the same medical issue. The first time we were quite impressed and were treated well by the staff. We even got a follow-up call from Katie there indicating what to do if the issue wasn't resolved by the round of antibiotics they had recommended. We did need to go back in and she was not there. Instead, we were greeted by an unfriendly and uncooperative front desk staff who told us we had to pay our $25 copay all over again and go through another test when we were told that would not be the case on the phone. We went ahead and made an appointment for later in the day and arrived at our appointment time only to find that they don't honor appointment times and we were in line with everyone else.   Bottom line is this organization does not honor what they say they will do, opting instead to repeatedly make you jump through unnecessary hoops when you are in need of their help. The back office medical workers are fine, but they are overshadowed by the inexperienced, untrained and inhospitable front desk staff who make it their role to make your unfortunate need to go to an urgent care facility even more unfortunate.  We will not be returning.

Maybe this was just an isolated incident, but for my wife to say she absolutely hated a breakfast experience is something that I've probably never heard from her mouth. The server was completely absent the entire meal - no check-in, no coffee refill, nothing. The food was bland. One of the poached eggs on the benedict was cooked through, the other barely runny. Didn't matter too much though since the meal was only luke-warm by the time it made it to the table anyway.  The owner came over and asked how things were and my wife said "disappointing," then she left and never came back. A bit later a manager came back to say it was our fault for not complaining while we were eating. Would have been an option had the server ever stopped by.   Never. Again.

The sandwiches at this place are incredible ... I mean incredible. Not only are they unique with a huge selection to choose from, but they all seem to be equally amazing. They have a gigantic selection of vegetarian sandwiches, including a veggie meatball sandwich that is too-big-to-eat yet somehow you find yourself not able to stop. Their version of a turkey rueben is solid as well. And the dutch crunch bread is worth whatever calories are in it and more - and this is about the only place in AZ where I've seen this bread. I would highly recommend Ike's. It's hard to find in the back of the Brickyard on Mill, but don't let that stop you.

I really like Tapacubo. It has a nice atmosphere with a large bar in the middle, comfortable booths around the walls, a nice patio on one side and pool on the other (part of the attached Graduate Tempe hotel).   I have been twice now and had the guacamole and chips both times. The guac is delicious and they give an ample amount. The chips are fine, not great but who cares since the guacamole is so good. The chicken street tacos are amazingly good. In fact, they would be perfect were it not for the very average corn tortillas that seem like you could buy in a grocery store.   There is a small yet decent beer selection, thankfully not just a bunch of Mexican beers. When you get a beer on tap, they are served in plastic cups - kind of weird but priced pretty well so who cares.   If you don't want tacos, tortas or a few appetizer-like shared plates, this is not the place for you. The menu is quite limited, but that means the food they do offer is done well in this case. I'd recommend it - much better and unique than most hotel restaurants.

For a soft opening, this place was fantastic. I got the Tuscan pizza with bruschetta tomatoes and spinach. The crust was thin, got it fresh out of the oven, perfect size for one. Great iced tea choices too (kind of random, but true).   The concept is a build your own pizza bar, but they also have specialty ones and salads. There is a nice looking bar too, but this is lunch and I'm not on Mad Men. Overall great experience... I will definitely be back.

I've been to Nush three times now and thoroughly enjoyed each experience. The food is light and healthy and delicious to boot. The iced tea is among the best I've had and the patio is really private, lush and generally shaded. Best of all, the owners are actively involved in creating a great time for every patron.   I had a catered event there and they made it a special night, from allowing us to park our bikes in a secure area to providing ample food for the group, decorating the area for our party to offering drink specials for our guests. And no matter what, try the fries...not the healthiest thing on the menu but worth the calories.
