Definitely one of our favorite good eats in town.   The magical cinnamon and sugar dusted sweet potato FEZ fries with their special dipping sauce is extremely addictive. When we go with a group, we always ask for extra dipping sauce so it is enough to share among everyone. One basket is enough to share among three-four people.  FEZ kisra is very flavorful. Lots of fresh and flavorful topping, one of my hubby's favorite on the menu.   FEZ burger is a good one when you want a safe option to try out their food, if you are a little less adventurous. The field salad that comes with it is fresh and tasty too.   My favorite dish is the Crisp Pomegranate Chicken. The sweet flavor of pomegranate dressing and the tender chicken breasts are beautifully complimented by the veggie and fruits that are placed below the chicken.   A surprise item was the breakfast kisra. It was actually surprisingly good, even my father in-law did not mind it. He has always been a simple cheeseburger kind of guy, but has really enjoyed all the food he had tried here.  We yet to try their desserts, mainly because by the time we are done with the fries and the main course, there was no more room... seriously, their portion is well worth the money!  The only one thing I did not really care for was the FEZ lettuce wraps.  It was cold and a little too sweet and fruity for me. But again, I don't really like overly sweet food...  I don't drink alcohol, but a few times my hubby and friends tried a few of their signature drinks and really really loved them. The list of a few favs: honeydew melon, key lime pie, apricosmo and pomtini. I did enjoy the virgin mojito here, FEZ is one of the few places I can actually order that.  Seriously, take yourself out there now and give it a try. Treat yourself with a basket of cinnamon and sugar dusted sweet potato FEZ fries, and try out one of their dishes, your taste buds will thank you for it.  Also, I rate their services to be outstanding compared to most of the restaurants at this price range.

I needed a hair cut badly... I am Asian, with long hair which also has LOTS of volume. After coloring my hair at home a few times and ended up with kind of a mess and dead ends, I decided to find a professional to help me out. With the fellow Yelpers' reviews, I made an appointment to go in at 11am on a Saturday morning.   With some complaints on here that people sometimes have to wait a long time, I showed up 20 minutes early so they can get me in line for the next hair stylist. Since I have never been here before, I will just take whoever they have available.  My hair stylist was Jacluyn Locust, and she did a awesome job giving my hair the make over it desperately needed.   She recommended to give me a HD Red Violet semi-demi coloring ($45) on top of the new haircut.   Since I already did some highlights at home (by my awesome husband.) It only took her 30 minutes to get the color on my hair and not worry about putting highlights in my hair.  Then she listened to my desires for a new hair cut that will help manage the volume of my hair and still keep the length. She gave me the best hair make over! I love my new hair. It is totally worth the $72.  I highly recommend going to the AZ Hair Co website and print out their latest coupon before going to your hair appointment. I saved $8 total with a coupon for hair cut and another one for coloring.  I finally found a stylist that understands my needs and did an amazing job. I will definitely be back again!

This is definitely THE place to get crepes in town. The variety is vast and the ingredients are fresh!  The crepe is a little bit tough and thick, but I think it might be by design because they pack so much real ingredients in it that it needs to be able to hold them in.  I ordered The Shirley with banana. It is Cream Cheese, Nutella, Strawberries w/ Whip Cream & Chocolate Sauce. I wanted some banana with it to make it even more tasty. It was huge and delicious~ I think it should be considered healthy since I had strawberries and banana... :P  My hubby ordered Graceland (Peanut Butter, Bananas & Honey) and a Bacon Egg & Cheese breakfast crepe. Both were delicious.   Bacon Egg & Cheese was very satisfying for breakfast. Graceland hit the spot for my hubby's peanut butter craving.  We can't wait to head back and try out all the other items on their Savory Crepe menu.

We are here for work for six weeks and I am craving for Taiwanese food. (I was made in Taiwan.) So I looked up in Google this place.  WOW. This is by far one of my favorite places now to get my Taiwanese food fix (compared to Ohio, Texas and Chicago). Growing up in Taiwan, there were lots of dishes that I love, but had a hard time finding since I lived in the US. One of my favorite is the "meat ball" or (rou4 yuan2). They have it, and sure enough, I ordered and it was good. We ordered total of 8 items including one bubble milk tea, only came to $30! It was a bargain. $3.50 - $4.50 per item is awesome for us who has a tight budget. I am gonna try their "Oyster omelet" next time!  As for the service. It was good and timely I think. The food came relatively fast.   Their extensive Taiwanese menu really makes them one of the best I have had so far. Mind you, I have not been to west coast yet, so there might be even better ones out there. But so far, this is the best for me.  Definitely will be back. I have photos to share later!

Seriously one of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area. The food is affordable and the service is just awesome.  We come here almost at least three times a week.   I always get #51 - Pho Dac Biet. Pretty much has everything in it. When ordered at the small size with a cup of water, the bill only comes to $4 with tax (the Pho is always 50% off all day). How can you beat that?   I know the serving size is much smaller than most Pho places, but with a society of being overweight, I would like to see more places offer smaller portions or even give you the option. I always walk out of there feeling stuffed with just the small Pho if I finish the noodles, meat and broth.  The flavor of the Pho is clean, not greasy - it is expected since Vietnamese cuisine is a light flavor to start with. I think it is much healthier. You can easily enhance the flavor with some hoisin and sriracha sauce to your liking.   The service is great. The owner always greets you with a beautiful smile. She also checks on you to see if you are ok with everything.   We definitely come here due to 50% for the food and 50% for the great service.

Came here twice. The first time was not bad. Since we were the only customer, we did not really notice the speed of the service, even though it was not very attentive, we figured it was kind of the attitude of the place. Food was great though.  The second time we came back, thinking it is a decent place to get a bite and recommended to our friends to come here for lunch, was a mistake.  There was a swing dance type event, however, most people seemed to be ordering drinks. And there were lots of empty tables. So we figured that there should not be too long of a wait because we were all pretty hungry.  It took 20-30 minutes just to get someone to attend to us and take our orders at the bar. The staff taking our orders were constantly distracted and very slow.  We waited for 45 min then found out we had to go to the bar and ask for our drinks. None of them were made or served without us continuously asking about whether our order was getting made or not.   After we finally got our drinks, we entertained ourselves at the play area that has a ping pong table and couple of other games, but after another hour, we were running out of patience.  We waited 2 hours for our food, and the last person that ordered waited 2.5 hours, which is after everyone had already finished eating. Again, the food was great, but the service was not very attentive. It did seem like they were a little under staffed for the crowd, but still... there was not a real good system for getting your food or drinks after you have ordered, especially when the music is blaring. Your "nick name" was called over the muffled speaker for you to either pick up or someone from the staff "might" bring it to you, if they know where or who you are. I'd recommend checking periodically to make sure you did not miss it if you go.  The food got 4 stars, when we finally got them but the service was so bad that I had to take two stars off. And the food was not really worth the 2-hour wait, especially when the service was really little to none during the wait.   It really was sucky for us because we paid upfront when we ordered and even tipped, and finding out later that we weren't really going to get much service at all, we regretted that we included the tip.  My advice for this place, make sure they are not busy before you decide to go there hungry... or if you have hours to kill and not super hungry, not a bad place to hangout if you do not expect to be serviced.  I want to like this place~ Unfortunately, given this place two tries, we will not return again, due to lack of service.

We came here on a Saturday and there was no wait. The reviews, and menu on the website all looked promising.  My hubby did not like their coffee at all. Tasted like the burnt Starbucks coffee.  He ordered the Fish and Chips. Homemade tartar sauce was a little on the sweet side, fish was ok and the french fries were not seasoned. We have had better.  I ordered the Prime Rib French Dip with a side of fruit. The bread was ok, the prime rib has a pretty good flavor. The dip was bland, almost like broth out of can. Side of fruit was really small.  I think they did a great job hiring someone to write up their menu and design the interior. But the food could use some fine tuning. For the price, I was expecting a little more flavor overall.  Probably will not go back again.

Just like a handful of other fellow Yelpers on here, I am a big Rudy's fan ever since I ate at the original Rudy's location in Texas. I love their moist brisket and cream corn which is like crack.   Living in Phoenix for the last 1.5 years, Texas BBQ House is the only closest thing that I have in Arizona that comes close to Rudy's, and I would say that Texas BBQ House is best local BBQ restaurant in Phoenix.  Like Joshua, I prefer the spicier sauce from Rudy's, but I think the meat and the sides are all really good! I saw today that they are opening a huge new location in Scottsdale. I think Texas BBQ House will do awesome there and Rudy's will find themselves a worthy competition here in Arizona.

So after visiting Rudy's today, I was able to do a much closer comparison. Texas BBQ House definitely has better moist brisket than Rudy's!

Just saw the article about this place on Chow Bella - Phoenix New Times. I can't pass up a cheap local eat near the house. So decided to give it a try.  I ordered the BUL-GO-KEE Bento to go. It is a pretty large serving! Generous amount of bulgokee over steamed white rice with two sides - veggie salad and pretty good macaroni salad.   I think I will be back to try the other bento options too, especially the chicken katsu.

Went back two more times and tried their Chicken Katsu Bento, Hawaiian Shrimp and Kal Bee Bento.   I think my favorites are Chicken Katsu and Kalbee so far. The portion of food you get for the price definitely won't leave you hungry. I actually had to eat my bento in phases so I can finish everything.  I love the fact that the whole family are working there from ordering to making your food. A really nice and friendly place to relax and enjoy affordable good Korean food.  Can't wait for them to extend their hours and add more Korean dished on their menu.

I love the fact we have food trucks here. It reminds me of the food stalls back home in Taiwan.  When I heard there is an authentic Chinese food truck in the city, I HAVE to give it a try! Finally made my way to their Miller Market location last night and ordered 4 items to go.  The beef noodle soup has got to be the best in the valley. I miss the flavor of a properly made beef noodle soup and Hao Bao's home made beef noodle soup hit the spot for me.  The handmade dumplings were delicious!   And I love the fact that Hao Bao uses chicken thigh meat (dark meat) for the street treats, dark meat always tastes 110% better than white and actually quite healthy and the marinate is lovely!  Too bad the scallion pancakes got soft when I reached home, but it was still delicious with a little soy sauce. It did take me about 25 minutes to get home.  Keep up the great work and looking forward to try out the rest of the menu!

As a Taiwanese myself, I agree with most fellow yelpers. This is definitely by far the best Taiwanese food in the valley. Taiwan Food Express has more items, but overall quality, I will vote for Henry's Taiwan.  I have only gotten Mango Smoothie and you can tell it was freshly made without any syrup. Nice and refreshing.  I enjoyed both the beef noodle soup and the black pepper chicken tenders. I eat them almost every other day for dinner. Good for my belly, not good for my weight though. HAHA...  Also had the chance to try their pan-fried hum bow, it was definitely freshly made. You can taste the sweetness of the pork. Will have to try the other dim sums on the menu.  Not too sure about the sauce used for the oyster omelet, there is peanut butter in there, which I am not used to. Maybe will decide after a couple more tries.  LOVE the fact that they deliver now~ Hope they are here to stay and open up a few more locations around the valley.

Christine is super professional and understanding of my squirmy fear of pain. Just finished my first treatment today and purchased a packaged treatment for follow ups!   My hubby got his whole back done and will be back for follow ups too.  Highly recommend Christine if you are interested in getting laser hair removal done. I love that her Tempe location is only 5 minutes from my house.
