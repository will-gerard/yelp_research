This has been my go-to grocery store for over 10 years as I live about a half mile away. However that's about to change! It looks like I need to find myself another grocery store.... For the past several months I've noticed a huge drop in quality and service. For example in the dairy section I often come across items (yogurts for example) that have long been expired (2 weeks or more). If you don't pay attention you end up purchasing expired products!!... Sometimes the non-expired items are hidden in the back of the shelf while the expired items are in front. Looks like the store is trying all it can to still sell these expired products!... I have pointed this out to an employee once and he didn't even bother removing the expired items! Buying organic milk is also a hit or miss. Sometimes they have some sometimes they don't. When they don't and I ask an employee if they maybe have some in stock in the back I usually get a negative answer. How can a grocery store be out of milk??? Depending on the day or time of day I've also noticed that items are in stock or not. I usually shop in the late afternoon between 5-7pm like most working people and often run into everyday items that are sold out. Really?? Is it really that difficult to manage inventory? Finally I've had a few instances where all my items don't get bagged and end up being left at the store. I've learned my lesson and inspect bagging during checkout so that items are not left behind. All the while making sure that items are being rung at the correct price as I've noticed this being an issue at times as well. Lately I've also end up with someone else's receipt a couple of times. How is this possible??? Don't employee get trained???... I agree that this store is usually clean and the Starbucks is a nice touch but in the last several months something changed (my guess probably with management?) and made this store sub-par and nowhere close to the level that it used to be. I have attempted to voice my opinions and concerns to management but seem to be hitting a deaf ear each time. It's a huge disappointment as I will have to go further for my groceries now and it probably will not be a Safeway as there isn't another one nearby! (I'm giving it one star now but would have given it 5* a couple of years ago)

I had recently bought a Groupon and took my parents who are 71 and 72 years old and are visiting from France on their 50th Wedding Anniversary celebration on the sunset cruise this weekend. This was one of the music cruise as it featured the Southwest Surfers, which is a Beach Boys tribute band. My parents absolutely loved it!!... The scenery, being out on the water in Arizona, the slow pace of the cruise, the late afternoon light, the 60s music... That was heaven for them and the perfect outing. Thank you!
