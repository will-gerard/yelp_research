My wife called Zee Best and, after her 3rd conversation with the owner, John, was able to get a quote to have a townhouse occupied by tenants cleaned. We explained we have a coupon from their website. The quote was for 4 rooms, a hallway and a stair case and was between $125-150 (each room was $15 and the coupon, which I have saved off of their website says that pre-treatment is included). John also reassured us that the price would be the same as in years past (we've used them for 3 consecutive tenants), except that there is a $10 trip charge they've recently started charging.   On the day of the cleaning (the following day), the technician who visited the townhouse called me and told me the price would be $195. I explained to him that we had a quote of $125 to $150 and that in years past the cost was $115 (so we expect the cost will be $125). The technician told me that the price of $125 is accurate, but there is $70 of pre-treatment, which was a deal (he told me it would normally be 700 ft at $.20). I explained that the coupon says pre-treatment is included and when he said it wasn't, I told him that I am sorry but that is not what I was quoted and he should go home. The technician then asked me "well what are you willing to pay"? He was clearly upset and told me at least twice that he just drove 40 miles. I explained that it isn't my fault that they service an area so far from the trucks or that his boss drastically misquoted the price. He then asked me if I'd pay $180, "no", how about $170, "no", how about $160, "no", how about $150, "fine". At that point I wanted to stop arguing with him as all of this was occurring with my brand new tenant (2nd day in unit) present as he took the day off of work to be home with the technician. I figured I'd call John after, explain to him that we had paid $115 each of the previous 2 years, and that we could just adjust this to $125.   When I called John, I got basic belligerence. He first told me that he asked my wife how dirty the carpet is. Not sure what that means, but that was never asked. Plus the quote was $125-150 with an assurance that it would be the same price as last year plus $10. When I attempted to reason with John, he called me a liar (re: what the coupon on his website says), my wife a liar (re: her statement that he never asked how dirty the carpet was) and never responded to why the cost wasn't the exact same as previous years, plus $10 like was quoted. John wouldn't let me speak and just spoke over me, stating he never should have quoted me (with which I agreed). The carpet was in the exact same shape (several stains) as it was after previous tenants. Zee Best couldn't remove the stains in years past and I didn't expect them to this time (which they didn't). I just wanted a clean carpet (i.e. no dirt) for my new tenant. The conversation ended with John finishing yelling at me and promptly hanging up.  The cleaning was average at best and the hassle and renegotiation makes it a no-brainer to avoid this company.

Update: Filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau on 6/5/13... to date the company has not cared enough to respond.   Make sure you think twice.

Do not bring your kids here!   Butcher!  Their website advertises that they "do it all"... haircuts and ear piercings, I should have known better.   Nonetheless, I figured I'd give our local barber a try for my 4 year old son's haircut.   After all, how hard is it to cut a 4 year old's hair?     The shop is a decent looking barber shop.   When we walk in there is a war movie on the tv.   I ask if they mind if I change the channel, or better yet turn the tv off.   Barber looks confused but says ok.   My son has medium-long hair and the barber asks what we want to do with it.  I respond to "take a little off and clean it up".    He points to a generic barber shop poster and says "like picture number 8"?   All 15 of the "options" that this shop apparently can do are very short.   I said "no, can you just take a little off and straighten it out"?   The barber says "like 1/2 inch", to which I responded was great.  My son sat absolutely still and quiet (both firsts for him).   Meanwhile, the guy tugged at his hair.    The guy then proceeded to take about 1.5" inch off, and left the back jagged and the bangs at a diagonal angle.   He asked me to look and see what I thought.   As I circled to the other side of my son, I was horrified as I noticed about a 1 cm gash.   I asked the guy if he cut him and he said "oh my, I must have".    So now my kid has butchered hair and a scar to show for our visit to 12th Street Barbers.   Hey, at least they gave him a lollipop.    I suggest you avoid this place, particularly if you have kids.   I have never posted a negative review on Yelp!   This was horrendous and because my child was injured, I wanted to warn others.

We used Rob in preparation for selling our house and my only regret is using the "discount companies" while we lived in it.   He is INSANELY thorough and meticulous.   I am picky... he is pickier.    He spends the time and does it right.   He did our carpets and some upholstery on furniture we were leaving to stage the house.   Everything looked brand new (and neither the rugs nor the furniture were close to brand new).   I can't recommend Rob enough.   The reviews are accurate.
