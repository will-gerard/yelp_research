I loved this hotel!   The lobby is beautiful and they made checking into the hotel easy and efficient. They also have an awesome business center with no limit on printing, definitely a win for the business traveler!   The room was also outstanding. It was large, spacious, and clean. The bed was also amazingly comfortable and I loved how they didn't have a nasty comforter on it. All hotels should take that tact.   I was supposed to stay here for two nights and was very disappointed I didn't have the opportunity to, it is a great hotel and if I am ever in Scottsdale again I'll be back.

I'm not sure why this place doesn't have a better rating on Yelp than it does but I'll do my part to contribute to improving it.  I stayed at the Courtyard Tempe Downtown for two nights last week on business. I immediately really liked the lobby area. It was welcoming and inviting and there were plenty of business travelers relaxing with a drink or coffee and getting work done on their computers. After a brief respite in my room I immediately joined the group and spent several hours getting work done in the lobby. The wifi was great and I also appreciated their business center and being able to print for free.   My room was equally pleasing to me. It was clean and spacious. I also appreciated the comfortable bed.   Finally, one of the great things about this hotel is it's proximity to so many things. There are a ton of bars and restaurants nearby and it is also very close to Sky Harbor Airport.   All in all I had no complaints about this hotel and would recommend it to any traveler!

Had dinner at FEZ with several colleagues while visiting Phoenix. Everything was delicious and the service was awesome.   We started out with the lettuce wraps and the calamari. I loved the server's suggestion of adding bacon to the lettuce wraps, a midwestern girl like me loves bacon in everything and the combo did not disappoint. I also really enjoyed the batter on the calamari and the awesome aioli that came with it.   For my meal I took the server's recommendation and order the FEZ burger, it was terrific! I was a little wary of the cinnamon pears but I could not get enough, the flavor combo on this burger is truly unique.   The only disappointment for me was the garlic and rosemary fries. They were not bad but I've had a lot better. They tasted like they were simply dusted with garlic salt.   All in all I'd definitely recommend FEZ to anyone.

This hotel didn't really do much for me. The guy at the check in desk was a total mess and they was a really long line. The room was clean enough but it had a distinct smell that I did not really prefer. I also ordered room service from the restaurant and found it to be very over priced for what they had to offer. I am sure there are other hotels by the airport that are much better than this one.
