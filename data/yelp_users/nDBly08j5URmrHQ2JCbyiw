If you can get past the goofy name, the food is pleasing in every way. How the staff behind the line can pump out delicious dishes like the best pad thai I've ever had, present each plate in something resembling high art, and not explode despite a fast-food pace is beyond my meager understanding. It's an Eastern thing, dude.  Also amazing: The female wait staff. Just go. You'll see what I mean. Yeah. Incredible.  Anyway, a good place to remember on North Central.

A relaxed-yet-sophisticated place where the combination of a good wine selection, great appetizers like salmon pate and interesting cheese plates, and respectable service make for  great happy hour experience in the area.

What a treasure to have in this town!  Plenty of hands-on exhibits for kids of all ages. There are even live demonstrations involving flour sifters and blowtorches.  I defy any kid to be bored when flour sifters and blowtorches are on-hand.  The entrance fee seems a bit pricey, but it's an honest 2 hours of entertainment, at least. They validate parking which is free for the first hour.

The only thing wrong with Alwun House is that there needs to be a half-dozen or so more like it along Roosevelt before Phoenix can really be said to have a "thriving arts scene".   I've been to several shows and events here, and last night made my second year at the annual Halloween Monster's Ball. I tell ya: If you want to party on Halloween you need to hang with some artsy people--you know, the ones who really know how to work with make-up and foam rubber and found objects. After consorting a bit with the devil himself, I made friends with a couple of dead girls and Abraham Lincoln. Cruella DeVille had finally caught those yapping puppies and had made a nice stole for herself out of their heads, and Gumby looked on aghast.   Anyway, it's a funky arts scene, and the gallery is usually stocked with interesting stuff. At events such as the one last night you can usually talk to the artists themselves. Very casual.   As far as the neighborhood is concerned--yeah, you want to lock your car and take the usual precautions. This isn't Chandler Fashion Center, thank God. The management is good about providing security at their events, so the only potential problem is walking to or from your car if you need to park a few blocks away. Just be aware of things around you (like you normally are, right?).

The produce in American grocery stores looks perfect but has no discernible taste, The produce in Mexican markets has gouges, bruises and imperfections, but tastes wonderful.   Priorities.  The place is vibrant with life that you don't get in any American-style grocery. It's a feast for the senses.   Don't expect fast or snappy service at the lunch counter. There's usually a line. Knowing Spanish helps a bit, but there's usually someone around who can translate. For your patience you will be rewarded with the real tastes of Mexico: The gristle of lengua, the insanely savory flavor of the carnitas, the wonderful aroma of the barbacoa.  Just go. Pick up some real tortillas and some Coke in real glass bottles too. It's still made with sugar, dontchaknow?

What can I say about a place that was my home-away-from-home for about 3 months of last year? I kept coming back on business trips for a few reasons:  The location is terrific. At Thomas and Central you are walking distance to some of the best Thai, barbeque, burger, ice-cream, breakfast, steak and deli restaurants the valley has to offer. What's more important is that a light rail stop is right at the corner. Buy a day-pass and you can go downtown to the sports stadiums and concert halls, or even down to old-town Tempe, up to the George and Dragon, Hulu, Maizies, Doc's place or Chars has the Blues, or out to one of my favorite Vietnamese pho place on Apache Blvd.  Add to this the quality of the rooms, bedding, and furnishings. All are good enough to make me feel I was being coddled, and good enough to consistently impress.  The atrium design of the hotel combined with the breakfast buffet means that at about 6:30 to 7:00 each morning you are softly, sweetly awakened to the aroma of eggs and bacon. There is no sweeter feeling. It's like waking up in your mother's arms.  The bar has a cast of regulars who provide local color. They also have bartenders who remember what you had last time, even if you were there only once a month before.  The waitstaff is attentive (usually) though there were times at the breakfast buffet when I needed to get my own coffee. By the time that happened i was comfortable doing it myself.  So what are the cons? Parking costs about $12 per day in the nearby structure, and getting from there to the elevator can be a bit awkward.  There is also no place to lay out in the sun if that's what you like doing.   Otherwise, I could easily consider buying one of the rooms and retiring there.

One of my earliest memories of Phoenix concerns waking up under the eucalyptus trees that used to cover most of what is now the business park and shopping center next to what I will call the "new" Duck. The old one was far larger and would have been about where the Starbucks is now. Of course, I'm talking about 1973 here, so I digress. . . .  Anyway, the current abbreviated Duck remains one of my favorite places to relax and hang out in Phoenix. Now I have a little one who enjoys running through the grass near the patio and socializing with the other youngsters that frequent the place. The bar features interesting wines by the bottle and glass. Most nights the by-the-glass happy hour special is something rather interesting, in contrast to the "red" or "white' found in other joints. The interior of the small bar is dark like a cellar. In fact, you can find a variety of atmospheres in and out of the Duck.  And the sandwiches! Yes, try them all. Very, very good.

This place has gotten under my skin.  I have been going there since shortly after they opened back in 1995 or so. It's been a landmark to me through much of my adult life. I've met the owner a few times and he's very personable.  So how is it? It's good. It's a pub that's nicely dark inside. The bar is comfortable, and they have British beer on tap--stuff like Boddington's.   The food is tasty and reliable. Stick with the specialties--the shepherd's pie, bangers and mash, cornish pasties, roast beef.  I've never found a reason to complain about the service.  There's a community built up around it, and you can occasionally meet real, live, BRITISH PEOPLE there! Imagine that!  So, a favorite of mine.

I am not quite as much of a cigar smoker as I used to be. The years have started to catch up with me. But when I get the hankering this is where I go.  They know their cigars and offer "alternatives" to the well-known brands. They're close enough for most purposes. If you are truly an aficionado, they have the real thing too, all stored in a perfectly cool and moist environment.  I don't know how much lung capacity I sacrificed while this place was liquidating the last of the Pierre Cardin Maxim's they bought out from some swank place in Paris. They were a deal at about $20 a bundle, and I was quite addicted. They even shipped them to me when I lived for a time in Colorado.   Always very nice on the phone. They even have stayed open a bit late for me when I have called ahead.

It's on a power corner featuring a cool divey bar (Pomeroys) a nice deli (Scott's Generations) a Bashas, a Starbux, Buffalo Exchange, the best damn bagels in town (Karsh's) and a few other things. So hey, all that and you can get hardware, too!   Try not to drink before getting hardware. You might get the wrong stuff.  Lots of bargain hunters put down Ace and think their prices are exorbitant compared to Home Depot and Lowes. And yes, their prices are usually higher for the same items. But in my case, I would rather pay a bit more more per-unit for wood screws than park a block away from the front door of HD, walk another block once inside, struggle to find exactly what I am after, be forced to buy twice the quantity that I need when I do find it, and then wait in line to check out. If I were still seriously doing home improvement (like drywalling a whole basement or putting up new rain gutters) I would still favor the big DIY chains. As a townhome dweller (rented at that) I choose to buy my cuphooks and cornbrooms at Ace.   Also, they seem to hire attractive and exceedingly nice people here. I probably shouldn't say anything. Whoops. I just did.

From the vending machines in the entryway selling gun and lowrider stickers, to the white plastic menu board hung partially askew, to the cheap-ass jewelry on sale laying out on top of the cash register desk, to the toothpick wrappers and various other little pieces of garbage on the floor in the foyer, to the fish pond with a single sad (possibly dead) koi, just about everything in the place screams "We really don't give a crap". That's the first impression.  Why 2 stars, then? Why not one?  Because the food was actually not . .. that . . . bad.  Still, if you're after Chinese buffet, try the one at 15th Av and Bethany instead.

This place at one time seemed too "high concept", but multiple visits have convinced me that it is rather genuine: A plain-old Texas cultural embassy.  I think I've never had a bad meal there. The steaks could be thicker, I suppose. And they do grease 'em up before they grill 'em, but the over all effect with the mashed potatoes is pretty satisfying.  I always get a Shiner Bock when I'm there. At one time it was one of the few restaurants in the valley that had them available.  Parking is pretty bad, and the seats could be more comfortable. But basically, come hungry and leave happy.

Just to be weird, I have only gone here for lunch. With Groupons.  All I can say is that a) the burgers are good b) it's so blatantly anti-yuppie that its actually appealing, and c) I need a leisure suit and a mid-70's Dodge to do this place right.

Yes, this is worth making a trip for.  The happy hour menu is inexpensive and innovative (try out the Asian nachos), the sushi has been fresh on every visit, and some of the combos on the top-secret underground menu (ok maybe not so secret any more) compare to some of the best sushi I've had on the coast.  The atmosphere is kinda hip and urban. Service is always good. I notice the owner frequently on-site and working, which is a good thing.  After happy hour some of the mixed drinks can get sorta pricey, but not unreasonable.  So yes, check it out.

Their breakfast on the weekends is the best-kept secret in the area. The menu features not only Mexican items but plain-old bacon, eggs, and pancakes. Prices are better than at most typical breakfast places.   The great thing about it (and something that this review might change somewhat) is that the Sunday morning crowd seems to not know about it, or are scared away by the fact that it's a Mexican restaurant that they think only serves huevos rancheros for breakfast.  Thus, it's always easy to get seated.

Spent more with them over the years than I care to remember. Always good selection and service. Something for almost any budget, provided you're willing to walk next door to the lower-range Denmarket subsidiary. It's the first place I think of shopping for furniture because whenever I've tried someplace else, something has happened.   Get on their mailing list for their annual (or semi-annual) warehouse sale. I've found some good stuff there with slight wear or needing just minor reconditioning.

Really not a bad deal at all. It's a real, live barber shop complete with hot towels and straight razors. The guy who cut my hair also cuts John McCain's. Brushes with greatness I guess. Yes,  you can touch me. For $20 bucks out the door it's hard to settle for the half-trained ministrations of the mass-market shopping mall hair-cutters when you can have this instead. It's the haircut of our fathers.  The atmosphere is nice and dark-wood manly.  The barber shop (if not the salon) scene in Arizona seems to belong to the Russian emigres. A Russian shop at 19th Av. and Northern cut my hair for 6 years. A Russian lady in Ahwatukee cut my hair for a few months this summer. Now I go to this shop staffed and owned by Russian Jews (closed on Saturdays and yarmulkes in full effect). It's all good.

Going to them is evidence of my masochistic streak, I think. Or maybe I'm just a slow learner.  In the 15 years or so I've used them--and I by no means get car full-service car washes frequently-- I have needed to take my car back to them several times for various reasons, or I just didn't accept it when the drying guy raised his rag and said Mali-VOO or whatever I was driving at the time. They've left china pencil marks on windows (that they put there), streaks on the finish, ashtrays full, neglected entire swaths of dashboard surface,  They also -- while doing a costly pre-sale detail job for me --managed to buff some circular patterns in to the tailgate of an F150 that then wouldn't buff-out.   So I gave them one more chance this week, after having been away for 5 years. I bought the "works" wash.  Result: Dust on the dash, streaks on the windows, some bird crap left on the trunk.  Come on, guys. . . .  geez . . . .   So I'm going to try somewhere else. Getting my car washed there is too much work for me.

Hey, now they seem to have guys hustling people at the gas station for washes.   Yesterday one raced out to tell me my fuel door was open, which he could somehow see from the opposite side of the car. I checked my mirror and could see he was full of . . . errr . . . mistaken. . . and waved and drove off. I saw a few other guys in red polo shirts on missions to get more people into the line for the wash using whatever means were necessary.  No thanks. Wash my car for free a few times to prove you know how to do it, then maybe I come back.

I suppose I'm biased since I consider this my "pub".  It's within stumbling distance from my home. I frequently stumble over there and back several times a week.  I think everyone should have a pub. It's like a living room away from home. The Armadillo has the requisite multiple TV's,, happy hour specials, pool tables, and an interesting assortment of Runyonesque characters who come and go. It's the closest thing to a dive you'll find in that section of the Camelback Corridor, and I mean that in the best and most enthusiastic sense. I love dives.  The munchies menu (discounted during happy hours and all-day Monday) includes several appetizers, including fried pickles, a very decorative hummus plate, and some of the best wings in the valley (try the Armadillo or Honey-Hot). Drink prices are good, and they have specials like "PBR power hour" (one dollar Pabst Blue Ribbon beers for you culturally-impoverished sorts).  Again, hard for me to objective, but it' a definite favorite that I would recommend to anyone.

Considering how douche-y it could be, it's really not that douche-y.  Drinks are expensive but prepared right. Service is good. The seating is comfortable and the atmosphere relaxing.   Note to the single guys wearing chin-strap beards and Affliction t-shirts while looking nervous and sitting at tables alone and not approaching women: Try "Hello" or "Nice outfit" or "Those martinis are great, aren't they?" or something. I'm old and fat and dress like I'm teaching a fishing class, but I'm not afraid of girls. Just talk to them like they are people.

Why does this place still exist?  Back when Sizzler went out of business sometime in the mid-90's one marketing expert explained the reasons behind it like this: "There was no longer any question people were asking to which the answer was 'Sizzler'".  Soon after it lost relevance--and went through at least one bankruptcy-- the chain disappeared.  CPK is a nicely-decorated facility at a great location, but besides being the only pizzeria in the Biltmore Fashion Park proper, there is very little reason to visit here. It's not the answer to any current question.  The pizza is never better than so-so. The toppings are never really that fresh. The salads are an uninspired-though-nicely-arranged pile of iceberg and other ingredients that wouldn't seem extraordinary at Applebee's. In fact, i think Applebee's does salad better. The service tends to be a bit slow. The drinks are pricey.  For all this indifferent straight-from-Sysco quality, you pay a premium price.  It's probably been 10 years since this place has had any cachet that might justify the higher prices. Maybe longer. I think they might be hurting since the departure of Planet Hollywood, which itself brought a study stream of cornpone slackjaws impressed by a name--though not enough to keep it in business.  If you're looking for Pizza in this part of the Camelback Corridor, hold out and go to the Parlor at 19th St.

The mission statement of Trader Joe's at one time (at least unofficially) was to bring good things to the lifestyles of schoolteachers. That is, to the lives of the educated, discerning yet underpaid.   At TJ's you can get things like good table wines, Italian-made pasta, gourmet sauces, and interesting cheese at prices that allow the masses to see how the other half lives. And that's why I've loved the place.  It pains me sometimes to think that it's kinda been painted with a wide "health food grocery" brush. In another review I'll go into just WHY I don't want honorable, egalitarian spirit of TJ's corrupted by elitist sneer of effete health-nuts.  So yes, I am a fan. I've always gotten a fair deal at TJ's even back when I was struggling to make rent on my studio apartment. I felt they were in my corner, and I still do today. Even though I could easily be an elitist, effete health-nut.

Let's face it: This is a paleo-conservative restaurant, right down to the prominent portrait of Barry Goldwater looking out over the dining room.  This is a place to take the other members of the board to discuss serious matters pertaining to corporate governance. There is nothing silly or frivolous in it. The lights are just bright enough to underline the respectability of it all.   In short, the decor has got the sort of overstuffed-leather-chair solidity that compliments the stern quality of the offerings. The lunch specials are a good value at about $16 bucks for a variety of high-quality plates. Service is something close to splendid.   This place makes you want to become a member of the military-industrial complex.

Soup's not the same. Place kinda looks post-apocalyptic.   This neighborhood needs a good traditional Americanized Chinese restaurant. They used to be all over the place. Plenty of people -- now having gotten the pretensions of "Asian Fusion" out of their system-- would be willing to come back. They could do a steady lunch biz from the local office workers and be a destination for dinner, but they're going to need to spend more than $20 a month on maintenance.  First time I've seen a sign on a buffet line reminding people not to dish food up with their bare hands.

Somehow I lucked out and found a place to live that's walking distance from just about everything that could possibly matter to me, and that includes what is probably the premier ski and ride shop in the desert.  Ski Pro is stocked better than the ski shop I frequent in Colorado, and unlike the Colo stores, Ski Pro wants to move stuff: Sales, sales and more sales. I just picked up a ski suit for my kid that was marked down from $175 to $59. It's still the middle of the season, folks.  They also appear to have a great selection of skis and boards, but that's a once in a blue moon type of purchase for me. Suffice it to say that they are stocked up with just about everything I could imagine needing for my wintertime hobby. And they are basically in the backyard of the Biltmore.  As far as the help goes, it's about average for this sort of business: No more subservient or attentive than absolutely necessary. These guys and girls are from a background of leisure and are working in a leisure business. Most probably come from the sort of middle-class families who can afford to ski. Asking them to be smiley and super-attentive is contrary to the spirit of these places--it's like expecting surfers to wear suits and ties. At least they didn't seem stoned, paranoid and semi-hostile-- like most ski shop employees in Colorado.  So check it out, and hang loose about the service, dude . . . Way . . .

Dark, quiet, cool and comfortable. Not the place to go for excitement. It's not a young energetic atmosphere. No, this is a place for the grown-ups to sit around and enjoy a clubby type atmosphere. It's relaxing.  The happy hour specials are good, and extend through whatever football game happens to be on.  I had the "Son of MOAB": A large hamburger on an egg bread roll. Not a bad deal at $6 for the combo.

Is it really like 20 years ago that Souper Salad was new? I used to love this place. I don't know how many pounds I gained while thinking I was eating healthy here.  This location is showing its age. The plates, carpet, and surfaces show scratches of many repeat trips for more Tuna Scroodle and garbanzos. There are occasional items missing from the line (it was pizza and about half the dressings this last time).  But worst of all:  There's a lilting smell in the air that they can't seem to get rid of, even after excavating the part of the mall behind the bathroom, supposedly after a sewer line break.  It's sad, but Souper Salad--particularly this location--seems to be well on its way to sinking into despair. A sign on the way out solicits new franchisees. Yeah, I'll get right on that. Got half a mil right here for a failing concept with little reinvestment and dwindling customer respect.

Warning on Sprint:  Even if you pay the monthly handset insurance, they have engineered their policies to basically force you to purchase an upgrade and re-up your contract if you run into ANY hardware problem after the first year or so of ownership.  The insurance only covers a direct replacement. If your handset is even slightly out of date they will tell you to wait (phoneless) 3-5 days for the replacement to get to you.  Of course, you can always upgrade . . . for a fee.  . .   But if you have made the mistake in good conscience of taking the phone to a service center first and waiting an hour to see if your phone can be fixed, and then decide to upgrade while there, that's an $18 fee for trying to get it fixed in person rather than just putting in your ticket online and waiting 3-5 days.   When you call to complain, you will be told that the charges are "system generated" and thus can't be removed. I found that escalating to a manager (using keywords "cancel my account") and telling him/her that you have a system that will generate letters to the attorney general and your credit card company and there is NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO STOP IT tends to work. I got my $18 back and I strongly suggest everyone else do this as well. If you don't get what you want on the first call, call back. And again. And again.  These policies apply no matter which plan you are on, and no matter how long you have been with them, and no matter how much other business you represent as a corporate customer.  So why 2 stars? Because really all cell phone companies basically suck balls and have from day one. At least Sprint usually lets me connect.

It's a big health food store.   Really big.   So big that they have walls full of things that I didn't know could fill walls: Almost infinite varieties of vitamins, protein shakes, extracts, tinctures, you name it. They probably have several different choices for just about any exotic elixir you could possibly need. Or want.  And, they have a loyalty program that allows you to buy the second of whatever at half-price, even on a later visit (within 60 days).   Their sales are usually pretty good. Some items are on sale but not on the flyer, so it's good to ask the clerk.  The people here know their stuff well, and spend more than enough time with every customer. Even the wacky ones.

It was overall a good experience for a birthday party for my 7 year old and his buddies from school.   For about $12 a head (adults and kids) we had enough pizza and drinks for everyone, and even wings and a couple of pitchers of beer for the grown-ups. The price even included ice cream, which went well with the cake I brought. Go for the extra token deal (100 for $20). It's hard to have too many tokens in a situation like this.  Food quality is about what you'd expect in an arcade that sells pizza. Nothing to complain about, really.  This location sometimes gets a few bad mentions for the clientele. We were there mid-afternoon on a Saturday and anyone used to a diverse central-city crowd wouldn't have been put off by any customer in attendance. Service was pleasant and and well-experienced. Our server knew how to stage things sequentially, which was appreciated.  About the only downside is parking. You might need to park between the pad which houses the place and the remnants of Tower Plaza instead of directly in front. Not a big deal.

Very relaxing. One of the better massages I've had. Nothing to dislike about the inside of the facility or the quality of the staff. Well-worth the $60 for the hour (plus gratuity).  Some things of note:  You pay in advance, which isn't a big deal considering the service appears to be pretty good. Just different than I remembered in other places.  Parking appears to be a premium front and rear. If you park in back make sure you're good with using your mirrors.  Yes, I plan on returning.

Finally, I experienced Postino. I had a day to myself and dropped by for a late lunch.   I can't sit in this place without remembering my many visits to this same location back in the 1980's when it was Synthony Music.   Yes, at one time this former post office housed a large selection of Oberheim Matrix 12's and OB-X's, Roland Junos, and Yamaha DX7's. Long-haired young guys with slightly nasal voices talked about multi-timbral effects, VCO's and VCA's, attack, sustain, decay. I can still hear the simulated sounds of shakuhatchi flutes playing the first few notes of "Sledgehammer" by Peter Gabriel--loudly enough to rattle windows.   I'm sure the equipment that got purchased here played more than a few weddings where white people embarassingly trudged around in some drunken fashion to "Take On Me" or "Celebrate".  Perhaps some of the current patrons were those very same dancers. Like the older guy who complimented me on my fishing vest.  But anyway, about the salad. It was good. I opted for the prosciutto as an add to the Italian salad. On the side was a good glass of tempranillo. There was a tang to it.   A tang. Yes. A tang which recalled a layered gong effect combining additive and subtractive synthesis--something one might hear from say -- a Korg DW8000--which used sampled waveforms modulated through analog filters. That's exactly what the tempranillo reminded me of.  When the waitress brought my check I realized that she looked a bit like Siouxsie Sioux, a few years on and minus the make up. Or perhaps it was Lene Lovitch.   Anyway, make time to enjoy a visit to Postino. And while you are sitting there, enjoy the echoes of "Are Friends Electric" by Gary Numan, which I am sure still inhabit the walls in some way.

One thing I noticed on a recent re-visit: This place is loud--both from ambient noise and the background/foreground music. And the hard surfaces and absence of carpet tend to accentuate the high frequencies. It can get kinda tedious trying to talk over it. Don't let that keep you away.  Just another way in which it pays tribute to its roots as Synthony Music all those years ago.

This place is real. It's the real deal. Looking for a dive that might just as easily be in some suburb of Chicago or Omaha? Here's your place. Totally devoid of any pretentions, watched over by Barkeep Linda who is right on the money and actually pays attention to what you're ordering.   This is a bar--a divey bar. It's not unclean or unsafe, but it's also not sun-shiney hippy-happy dipsy-doo, either. People will leave you alone if that's what you're after. Or if you want to talk they'll gladly talk.

A really good place to hear a local band. The stage is well-positioned and there's an actual dance floor. There's a tall riser for the drummer so you can actually see him (or her) play. Drinks aren't expensive, and there was no cover the night I was there.  Sadly, the woman who dragged me out on the dance floor ended up crashing into a speaker post and spraining an ankle. There were RN's in attendance who improvised an urgent care center on one of the barstools.   It's that kind of place. Enjoy.

My trips to the airport these days are stress-free. Discount Cab takes me there. The drivers are capable and courteous, and the rates are reasonable.   If only they could pick me up on the way back.  My trips FROM the airport are with Yellow Cab, who seem to have some semi-exclusive arrangement with the airport, at least out of terminal 3. Discount is prohibited from picking up at the airport.  So I am left with Yellow Cab most of the time. Dickish drivers who roll their eyes when you pay by credit card, set your bags on the street and leave without so much as a "thank you" are no way to build business.  If you have an alternative, take it.

Ok, Mr. Goat-$&(*&$ or whatever: I don't care that you don't wear your seatbelt. I'm libertarian enough to believe that whatever you want to do to risk your life is cool as long as it doesn't jeopardize others.   I could have done without the federally-mandated periodic  ding-ding-ding from the dashboard of that Chevy reminding you, begging you, pleading you to put your $($(&( seatbelt on. That was a bit annoying. But I coped.   I didn't even care that you babbled into the phone the whole trip back from the airport. Maybe you were setting up a date for your daughter or  sister or something.   But goddammit, you don't roll the **$(&$ windows up when the air is broken just so you can hear your phone conversation better when you have customers in back.    F&($ you. That's about as nice as I'm going to get.   And get your credit card machine fixed, you fool.

A flawless experience at this icon of old Phoenix, and a better value than most other premium steak places I've visited.  In more cases than I can recall, a place with the history and legacy of the Stockyards would have fallen into complacency long ago, milking the same group of dedicated customers and giving less value to anyone who's not a regular. However, our visit was great from the moment I made the reservation.   The menu is very traditional, and they've even played the retro angle by bringing back a prix fixe option that includes Steak Diane. We opted for the Chateaubriand for Two, and it was some delicious melt-in-your-mouth beef. No complaints on the service, either.   As far as attire goes: It's a fancy restaurant in some ways, but remember that it's in Phoenix, and that it was originally located next to one of the largest feedlots West of the Mississippi. You won't look out of place in jeans and a polo.

My first time at this location, and if the food weren't actually pretty good, I would have rated it a one.  We visited during a lunch hour on Saturday, and I wouldn't have thought the amount of business justified a waiter taking literally a few minutes to get our drink order. In fact, I think ours was the only table in the section with customers seated. I was tolerant of this initial slowness thinking it would get better from there, but it never did. Every step required an extended wait right up to getting my check. The waiter didn't even check in on us while we were eating. When I got up to go to the bathroom after the check had been presented suddenly the waiter was there to get his money. And this is the ONLY time I've been asked for my ID with my credit card at a restaurant.   Some might defend that as a necessary and even nice security step given the world we live in today, etc. But if left a bad taste in my mouth. A restaurant shouldn't be doing this. I had just spent over $100 for a dinner and drinks in a far nicer place in Denver, and wasn't asked for an ID.  So overall, a decent place with good food who needs to manage their help a lot better, and stop asking for ID from customers paying with credit cards.

It's about as good of a salad bar as you're going to find anywhere, and far outclasses SouperSalad, who remains their only near competitor.  When I've taken my time and thoughtfully combined ingredients, I've had some wonderful, tasty low-cal and low-fat meals at Sweet Tomatoes. Of course the temptation is to just pile stuff up on one's plate, and that's what most people do. Usually that just leads to indigestion and negates the whole "health" aspect. I've done that as well. Shamefully. Regretfully.  The cost can be reduced with coupon (that seem to come in every Sunday newspaper) and by foregoing soda, juice, tea, coffee. It's a lot of good quality food for $8-$9 per person presuming you can get by with water. Do you really need a Diet Coke?  During my visit today at this location none of the complaints I've noticed from other reviewers applied. The help was very attentive, my tray and used plate were collected quickly, and there were plates and additional silverware near the hot food.  The turkey noodle soup was tasty, and all of the salad ingredients were fresh and of a high quality. Compare that with the typical SouperSalad where everything tastes shot through with nitrates or something.  So yeah, it's usually a good experience.

When I get a document notarized at the credit union for free, then take it to my office, stupidly fax it to the wrong number by not adding a "9" at the start only to get a call an hour later from the bank employee who notarized it telling me that the person who received it in error had called her to let her know some numbskull was faxing important-looking legal documents to him by mistake, and does it all with a maximum of cheerfulness and forbearance. . . that's service.

About as good as it gets for Chinese buffet: Fresh food, dishes that don't make you go "ewwww . . . what the hell is that doing here???", real sushi made fresh, mongolian BBQ, a nice full bar, decor that's modern, sleek and clean combined with friendly and efficient service-- All for less than $10 at lunch. I'm in CentPho but still think it's worth the drive.

A good place for an early breakfast, because you can get steak and eggs for $6.99 before 7:30. And the steak is really pretty good. Coffee not bad, either.   The items on the rest of the menu appeared to share one thing in common: Prices 15-20% lower than I'd expect to pay anywhere else.  Good, cheerful, and cheap little diner.

This location is not quite as swank as the one in North Scottsdale, but still offers a lot for the considerable monthly fee. Plenty of equipment in good repair, clean showers and locker rooms, a great kid's area, and pool areas (indoor and out) that would be at home in a vacation resort. I've been with Lifetime a year and I still think it's worth it.

This is a good place to take kids from about 3 to 12 years old. There are plenty of things to see and do, moon rocks to touch, interactive exhibits to engage them, old control panels with buttons to push.   Above that age range it doesn't seem to have a lot to offer at this time.  A good thing is that it seems almost no one knows about the place, so it never seems crowded.

This is a big deli that knows how to get people fed at lunchtime.   That's what they do and they do it well.   People from the East Coast that I bring here for business lunches are uniformly impressed. It compares favorably with some of the more popular and venerable delis in Manhattan.   The signature pastrami/brisket/bbq sandwiches are the main attraction, and are quite tasty.   It's a good, very basic, proletarian eating establishment.  So that's what Park Central Deli does well.  What it doesn't do well is provide comfort to people with vegan/vegetarian diets. It also doesn't do well by people looking for affectations and decor, or a place to pose with various Apple products while wearing earth-tone turtlenecks and drinking expensive coffee. Don't come here if any of the above might be you.  This is not a hair salon. This is a barbershop.   You go to Park Central Deli to eat, just like you go to a barbershop to get a haircut.  Enjoy!

In addition to Cheuvront, another reason to take the lightrail on Central.  The pizzas here are fairly close to what I enjoyed in Rome.  Wine selection is good, and the martinis are well-made.  Service is sometimes not as snappy as it could be, but never rude or cold in my experience.

It's the YMCA. The original gym/fitness center. Ok, I mean in modern times--like the last 120 years or so. If you have kids and live in the community it's worth belonging to the YMCA just for the discounts on kids activities and the chances for involvement. But the YMCA in the Phoenix area also has several surprising features in their workout center not found in other places.  I belong both to the YMCA as well as a corporate gym (LA Fitness). It's surprising to me that YMCA has implemented the FixLinxx System while the sales reps at LA Fitness have never even heard of it. FitLinxx allows you to keep track of your cardio and circuit strength training by first logging into a central console when you arrive, then entering your PIN at each machine as your progress through your workout. The system lets you track your progress in a convenient way, keeps you on the straight-and-narrow for range of motion and speed of reps, and even bitches you out if fall short of your goals for training frequency or sets/reps for a given time. I have found it to be wonderfully helpful in my program. Again, LA Fitness does not have anything like this system, but most YMCA's in the Valley have FitLinxx fully implemented. And the family rate for the YMCA is attractively low considering it includes things like child care during common workout hours.  This location tends to have a lot of older members working out throughout the day, which can get embarrassing for people 20-30 years younger (like me) who can't keep up with them.  The biggest drawbacks for me (and reasons why I joined another gym) were the limitation in hours (close early most days and at 3 on Saturdays) and the location (it's a 6 mile drive for me). Also the facilities are often not as well-kept as they could be. At times nearly a third of the treadmills will be out of commission.

Really not a bad place at all.  Live music on Friday and Saturday nights. I heard a band called "Geo" that played exactly what the crowd needed to hear:  A combination of funk, soul, country, salsa and cumbias. It's a nice, varied clientele, in other words.  Drinks are cheap and the wings are not bad.  I paid a $3 cover and didn't mind it at all.

This is one of the best and most horrible places I've been.   Crowd is composed of various dangerous-looking people, some of whom were on oxygen or in wheelchairs. One bartender is a cranky Uncle Jesse impersonator whom--I was told--turns off the karaoke from time to time in mid-song.  The other bartender appeared to have something else on his mind: Perhaps a desire to be somewhere, anywhere else. They were out of a couple of the beers on tap this particular visit. TV's are all over the place and most of them are tube sets, some with skewed pictures. Drinks are not especially cheap, but not that expensive, either.  So what's so good about it?  It reminded me of the Thunderdome, and on a few occasions I felt like shouting out "WHO RULES BARTERTOWN!!!!!?!?!?!?!?!" in a faux Aussie accent. This is Metrocenter and the West side after the apocalypse. It's already happened, and we didn't even need nukes.  So, four stars for the wonderful, horrible experience.

When exactly did this place start sucking?  I can remember seeing it as a destination back in the 90's. Even through the first part of the 2000's it was old reliable.  Now, wings battered and bland (they DON'T batter them in NEW YORK!), pizza so-so, service so hit-or-miss that at times I feel like serving my own table.   What the hell happened?

Sun Devil Chicken. Try it.  House Special Chicken. Try it.  These are dishes that are distinct enough from standard Chinese fare to bring me back again and again. Though the Abacus looks like any other standard strip-mall Chinese, the creativity the owners show on these two items sets it apart in my mind.   I've been going there for about 13 years now.   An old favorite.

It should be called "Mesa Museum of Various Things You Didn't Think You'd Find Together, But Will Nonetheless Likely Find Entertaining and Informative".  But they're into brevity out there in Mesa. Town only has 4 letters in its name. So they settled on "Museum of Natural History".   If the dinosaur and geology exhibits (which are pretty impressive) get boring, follow the path starting in the room with the puzzles and toys near the 3-story waterfall and you can check out an exhibit on the history of movie production in Arizona. Keep walking and there are examples of Native American art and pottery. Keep going! You still have to check out the replica walk-through gold mine. Oh, and that ends in the actual Mesa City  Jail that was in use from the 1930's through the 70's. You can hang out in an actual jail cell and be reminded of why you don't punch people in the face when they tick you off. Namely: Because jail sucks.  Then, when you get out of jail go outside to the backyard and do some real-life gold panning in the stream. Honestly, it's probably iron pyrite, but the effect on the imagination of a 5-6 year old is the same.  It's worth the entrance fee. Tons of fun for everyone!

A fun and varied menu with good service. We were seated quickly and the server let us take our time to decide on relatively busy Saturday night. We enjoyed some very tasty sashimi (the ahi was a standout) and a couple of their custom "Kona Rolls". I've always liked the dark and cool atmosphere.  Another very satisfying experience at this location where I have been spending the occasional datenight since . . . . geez . . . . Clinton was still President. Just realized. . . .

Go for the happy hour, enjoy the drink specials ($5 martinis among others. Yay!) and order the Big Ass Burger, but before you do remember these points:  It's open seating during happy hour (which runs 4-7). There were people sitting and standing around showing various states of impatience when we arrived. We walked around through the bar and front patio (the only areas open for happy hour) searching for an open table. Finally, a very nice manager caught up with me and offered a booth in the dining area with the caveat that we'd need to finish up or move to the bar by about 6:45, before a dinner reservation came in. We jumped at the offer, likely pissing off some others who had been waiting as well, and probably longer . No complaints in the way it was handled, but be aware that it's popular happy hour with open seating and when you arrive for a table you are basically on your own.  Second, it's an older crowd.  They look more like Scottsdale golf course residents than workers from the surrounding buildings. No problem there, either. Just a reminder that the line between "happy hour" and "early bird special" continues to fade.  Third, it was busy so service was a bit slow, though not unpleasant at all.   I guess the message for y'all: This place gets busy during happy hour. :-)

It will be a very sad day when this place is plowed under and replaced by some concept restaurant or medical-office space. It's a small reminder of the wacky little place that Scottsdale used to be and hasn't been in like 40 years. Go now before it's too late.

Wine menu full of interesting, dry reds. The tapas are flavorful enough to slap you upside the head. The prices are rather pricey, but it includes a show: You come here for flamenco guitar and dancing. It also makes a good date place located as it is near the strolling- and people-watching grounds of Scottsdale Civic Center.   Architecture and interior design could probably use a freshening. Looks like it hasn't changed in 22 years. But then a lot of Spanish restaurants in Spain haven't changed in 200 years. So . . .

Had my first visit there this afternoon.   Very good broth in that pho. I had a large bowl of the number one "everything" version (complete with tripe). The meat had been cooked long enough to be tender. The spring rolls were good but not that far above average.  Perhaps one of the best indications of a good ethnic restaurant: There were plenty of customers of the ethnicity in question.   Service was very good. The spring rolls came out almost immediately as an appetizer, which differs from many other places I've been.  So yes, I'll be back.

Back in the mid-Nineties, studio-apartment-dwelling, student-loan-burdened me would come here and get great deals on things like Ecco shoes, Kenneth Cole shirts, fashionable jeans, and other things I never could have afforded new from Nordstrom's. Sometimes the condition was questionable, but the price always reflected that. I wore out several pairs of high-line shoes purchased here for $11-$12.   Those days are long gone. Now, can't find a pair of shoes here for less than $30. The clothes are picked over. And mainly, going there is an opportunity for me to  bump into the future ex-Mrs. Bill B., or perhaps the exit strategy from the current prospective Mrs. Bill B.   Because If you're looking for young or not-quite-so-young-anymore shoppers in 5-inch heels, miniskirts and too much make-up, this is a great place to find them.  Just don't offer to buy them shoes. Anymore. These days.

I'm sorry, is this supposed to be a dive bar? Shady's fails at being a dive for multiple reasons, but that shouldn't dissuade anyone from coming here.  A dive bar needs to have an element of desperation and danger about it. At Shady's the only danger I discerned was in maybe parking in the wrong place and risking getting towed. Oh, and the Xavier grad sitting next to me was wearing sharp-looking jewelry on her wrists that I was afraid might have chafed me if I had gotten around to making out with her. Fortunately (or unfortunately) I didn't have a chance to find out.  A dive bar needs to have at least a few maintenance problems, especially in the bathrooms. There needs to be things scrawled on the walls, phone numbers in the grout, tinges of excrement on the floor, doors off their hinges, etc. This men's room looked like it had been prepped for a photo shoot for the bathroom of the year issue of "Janitorial and Infrastructure Weekly".   At a dive bar the bartenders aren't just sarcastic (and by the way, I didn't discern any biting wit behind Shady's bar) they are borderline defensive, making sure that you get a view of the billyclub beside the cash register. At Shady's the bartender snarkily asked "What can I get you?" after acerbically stating "Hi."   And the crowd: Dive bars need to have at least half their customers on public relief of some kind. The remainder need to be either hookers, dealers, undercover cops, or depressed schoolteachers. Admittedly the Saturday-night crowd at Shady's looked like they might have recently faced a major life decision that left them at a serious crossroads, not quite knowing where to go from here. I had a feeling for most of them it was "Audi A4 or A6?" or "Circulon or All-Clad?". Perhaps some of them also are still haunted by having missed the big sale at Banana Republic last week.  So what do you get at Shady's if not the genuine dive-bar experience? A safe-feeling, clean, comfortable place where the Guinesses are poured right, the jukebox is full of punk, ska, early alternative, and reggae (but is never too loud), a welcome absence of sports (only two small TV's and both were showing John Hughes movies), and a relaxed and upscale-looking crowd, all of whom probably think they are slumming.  Ha. Ha. Ha.

Yet another good establishment within stumbling distance for me.  I first went there to see a UFC fight (no cover). I was surprised at the drink specials, the lively crowd, and the good service despite the place being packed to the rafters.   Each time I've been back since I've been pleased. The 2-for-1 burgers on the weekends is a stunning deal.  Compared to the Armadillo Grill (just about a quarter mile away) this place is more fancy with a better-dressed though less-colorful crowd. It also lacks the Armadillo's off-track-betting and that certain charming dive-y flavor.  Not my favorite sports bar in the area, but a nice destination nonetheless.

This place is a no-nonsense food place. It's not a concept. It's not a chain. It's not a lifestyle. It's a restaurant where very good-tasting food is served in a comfortable, laid-back, unpretentious way.  We need lot more places like this.   I usually have a burger  of some description (frequently on special) which features a hand-formed patty and is usually cooked just as I ordered it.  The dinner entrees are big enough for two and are therefore called "BIG DISHES". I can remember the grilled chicken on the polenta as a standout.  The happy hour menu features some fun items not seen many other places. This is also one of the few places in town that serve a vodka martini with just the right mix and just a little sheen of ice on the top.  About the only thing I didn't like was a smoked salmon special that was too dry and not very flavorful. Can't win all of them.  Definitely a destination on North Central.

This is an honest-to-God barbershop and almost a community center. While you get your hair cut you can also get your watch battery changed and get a bid on your gold chains (they BUY GOLD the banners will let you know).   I have rarely had such a thorough, conscientious haircut anywhere, and I used to work in the salon business. Not the cheapest, nor the most showy, but just a good value in a haircut from earthy Russian barbers whom I'll return to again and again.  BTW: It's a $1 transaction fee if you pay with credit. Not a deal-breaker, but good to know.

A great place to land for happy hour or brunch. I usually go to the uptown location, but this one is just as good.   By the way, I actually did previously go to the bar that came before the Vig at this location: It was the sort of place that made Philthy Phil's look like the Ritz.

Oh yeah. Now we are talking.   This place is so old-school every time I go there I feel like I should be driving an Olds Toronado and wearing a Jantzen Shirt-Jac. I want to travel back in time and show up with Angie Dickinson on my arm and smoke a fat cigar in their bar while calling the waitress "sugar". I walk through the front door and suddenly it's 1972.  And yes, these are good things.  The ceilings are low, there are no windows to speak of, and the the brick arches inside recall something like a German rathskeller.  Along with more modern dishes, the menu features old delights like Osso Bucco, Liver and Onions, and Beef Wellington. At the salad bar  you load up your pewter plate with julienned carrots among other things under a generic "Salad Bar" sign that probably came out of a Sysco catalog 30 years ago. Just behind the salad bar is the grill, steaming away under a large copper canopy. Watch and smell those delectable slabs of meat give up their aroma. An offering to the gods of polyester, Johnny Carson, and the man who reads Playboy.  The martinis are adequate, though not killer. Actually they are probably made the same way they were back when the place opened in 1965. It's only recently that "superpremium" ingredients have raised the standard to lofty heights.  On my most recent visit I had the grilled salmon-shrimp special which came with a couple of asparagus spears, a lemony-butter sauce, a few shrimp and steamed veggies for $21. Hey, as much as I fantasize I need to remember it's not 1972 anymore. Thanks to modern technology I know what my arteries look like. Though the flavors were good, I felt that both the salmon and the shrimp were both a little over-cooked. Overcooked shrimp are safe but rather tasteless. The sauce helped compensate, and the overall effect was satisfying.  I looked longingly at my companion's prime rib, which was delivered exactly as ordered: Medium rare. The prime rib is the star of the show in a joint like this.  There are nightly specials during the week that look like good values.  Though I wouldn't change a thing about the decor, they do need to look after bathroom maintenance a bit, and some background music would be nice.  I plan to return regularly to soak in that 70's flavor. I need to find some white shoes and a matching belt.

For a two-month period this Summer and early Fall, CK's was a remote office as well as a Saturday night hangout for me. Fond memories, actually.  Good:   Very good wifi Snappy service Sports-bar menu items Good patio where you can smoke cigars Live music! (including a band staffed by employees of Fender Guitars) A fairly good place to meet new people (I found).  Not so Good:  Sports-bar menu items (and not much else) Limited parking (at times)  A good place in the neighborhood, and one of the few things that tug at me to return to Ahwatukee.

I find excuses to go into work just so I can walk across the street to enjoy a Lennyburger.  It's an addiction. I heard somewhere that addiction is defined as thinking you can't live without the thing that's killing you. In my case it's the delicious, complex flavors that only grilled beef can provide. Who cares if I have the arteries of a 60-year-old in the body of a 40-year old?  This place is the inverse of McDonalds or Burger King. You get the full flavor and none of that hateful aftertaste from either the burgers or the fries.  Still. . . .fat. . . .sodium . . . . gaahhhh  Oh hell, we're all going to die anyway.

Faultless decor, service, and food.  I had the pot roast, being as I am a fan of good old 'murrican comfort food raised to new levels of refinement thanks to superpremium ingredients. I wasn't disappointed. There was a nice sear on the outside to hold the moisture and flavor in. The mashed potatoes were delicious, and the veggies (including fennel) were done perfectly.  The prices were reasonable, and I could imagine taking a family here to experience really GOOD food.  I'll be back. Even thought the hotness of the waiter that Amy found irresistible must have escaped me. ;-)

The first question that comes to my mind upon considering this or any other Wal-Mart is: How much will they pay me to take the stuff they keep in that store?  I'm the last to jump on any semi-socialist soapbox, railing against Wal-Mart for crimes against working-class humanity. Hell, I shop at Target and they aren't necessarily a mom and pop business. Most jobs in big-box stores don't pay a living wage, and when I go to a megastore as a consumer I don't expect the human touch. I am looking for an efficient experience in obtaining something I need (or really, probably only want) for a reasonable price.  It's just that at Wal-Mart the combination of the herd mentality of their regular visitors, the lighting of the store, the demonstrably lower quality of the items they carry, the indifference of their employees, and the management's general willingness to treat their customers like shrinkage risks makes me wonder if maybe the Soviets won the cold war anyway. Or maybe it was the Red Chinese who won.  So to me Wal-Mart has fallen from being a symbol of vigorous capitalism at its best (back in the early 90's) to a symbol of how individual dignity gets trampled when it comes up against the lowest-common-denominator needs of the collective. Da, Commrade. Five year industrial plan. Bucket of pickles, only $5.99. You buy now!  I guess there's nothing I need that badly. Unless they are paying me to take it. Even then . . . .

I get the feeling it's on its way out, which is sad.  Sat at the bar for dinner. The bartender appeared to have been injured and walked with a stoop. I felt sorry for him as he struggled to provide things like set-ups and drinks. We waited far too long for a simple order (Nana's chili and a burrito). The food was bland when it finally arrived. The only napkins were cocktail napkins. Even the check took too long to get there. The guy obviously needed help, but no one was helping him.  Too many other better choices around. I can't think of a reason for a return visit.

Yes, just about every free-standing bar (meaning one that's not part of a hotel or something) tries to claim sports-bar status by littering their walls with big-screen TV's and tuning each to some different game. Well . . . see . . . anyone can do that, which is why it's popular. To make a REAL sports bar you need a management who develops sports as the raison d'etre of the place itself. And yes, I just used a fancy French phrase to philosophize about a sports bar.  Hazelwood's not only has large TV's on almost every vertical surface, they have TV's at every booth, just like truck stops in the old days had mini-jukeboxes.   Hazelwood's has good bar-fare at good prices on their menu, but also impressive specials that are only in effect during games. One of their beer specials when I visited was Widmer Hefeweizen. How often do you see that on special in other places?  Hazelwoods's not only welcomes local amateur sports teams, they sponsor a few, like the local rugby guys.  Hazelwoods will not only call you a cab if you over-imbibe, they also will shuttle you home in their own shuttle craft for free within a reasonable distance. This is putting their money within reasonable distance of their mouth, if you ask me.  But what is most important--and is most likely a result of the policies and features above--is the customer base. When I go into a sports bar and sit at the bar I want the guys next to me--strangers who just happen to be sitting there--to occasionally lean over and say in breathless excitement while staring me in the eye "THE DIFFERENCE IN TIME OF POSSESSION IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE GAME WAS LESS THAN 5 MINUTES BETWEEN NEW YORK AND INDY!" Seriously, this is important to me because just as people in a dancing bar should be fully involved with dancing, people in a sports bar should be fully involved with sports. And I find such running commentary helpful because I basically don't know shit about football.  Also, on the night I was there the rugby players were entertaining the whole bar with their profane gang-sings about necrophilia and such. This further contributed to the integrity of the impression. This is a sports bar full of sporty people.  So yes, Hazelwood's is a success and deservedly so. This is a SPORTS BAR. It's not an Applebee's, nor is it a dive with a lot of TV's. If you enjoy the spirit of the rabid spectator and can share the excitement of those who thrill to vicarious participation, you should go to this place.

There aren't many places around the valley that can pull me from a distance like a shard of ferrous metal in the thrall of an electromagnet, but this is one of them.   It's mainly the atmosphere on the open patio, I think. Or maybe it's the strong selection of dry reds and the little plates featuring things like manchego cheese. Maybe it's the lighting inside of the place on the ample couches. Maybe it' the service which manages to be both accommodating and relaxed in a real way.  In any case, this is a nice place. A very nice place on North Central.

Overall, just this shy of an utter delight.   The shrimp cocktail made a great impression with the oxymoronic jumbo shrimp suspended in cocktail sauce above a boiling cauldron of dry-ice steam. The horseradish and sauce combo was something close to ambrosial.  I ordered the bone-in filet done "rare-plus" and believe it to be some of the best prime beef I've experienced. My friend had the porkchop which also was done just right. The sides were the gorgonzola mac and cheese and a dish I almost refuse to believe were brussels sprouts: they were THAT tasty. We left with 5 boxes of leftovers, and neither of us could be called dainty eaters.  The atmosphere spoke of swank in a way that a high-dollar steakhouse should, with friezes in glass panels and blood-red lighting throughout.   So what holds me back from 5 stars in this case? Well, at this level of pricing ($47 for the filet a la carte) in a place like this on a Friday night, no customer should need to remind the server twice to bring water. And we did.  So, not quite perfect. Would I go back? I think so.

This, my friends, is pretty close to the real deal.   It's a dive.  Honestly, if you are looking for a nice place that just seems "dive-y", check out Shady's. This is no place to take a lady.   But that's what I love about it.   Here, there's a sense of what we used to call "communitas" back in college. It's a sense that boundaries of the normal world don't matter, and everyone can be themselves with impunity.  And can re-create themselves into something new and different.  And boy, do some people get into that.  Anyway, I've seen people in here who looked like they had nothing to lose and somewhat acted the part. I've also seen people who reminded me that true wealth lies elsewhere than in a lease on a new BMW. Happy, secure people who knew themselves and were just living life one SSI check at a time.  And I've also seen women I was sure were streetwalkers do really good karaoke renditions of Eurythmics songs.  So know what you are getting into, then go (minus attitude) and enjoy.

I think it had been about 36 years since I had set foot in a YMCA before I joined this branch last Summer. I didn't remember much about the last time other than tile--lots and lots of blue tile. Oh, and feeling like I was almost drowning. My early swimming experiences weren't pleasant. So, I was a bit dubious when my sister suggested I join and talked about the place as though it were a palace of some kind. Hell, it's a YMCA . . . you know . . . . ewww . . .   Well, this location in Ahwatukee is not quite a palace, but as gyms go it's pretty damn close.   Just working out today I noticed that although the construction materials are just about what you'd find in a warehouse, the design makes the main gym hall feel like human space. That must be hard to do with a gym since so many other designs get it wrong. A lot of thought and inspiration went into the architecture here, and it shows.  The heated beach-entry pool has totally entranced my little 4-year-old, as has the active water sculpture-thing in the pool, which he can activate all by himself just by pushing a button.  There are not only dressing rooms for each gender set up with direct access to the pool, but one set aside for families. That one also has its own access to the pool area.  The machines are up-to-date and kept in good repair. This location uses the FixLinxx tracking system I've talked about elsewhere. There's a dedicated spinning room and a separate set of the simple "grampy-style" weight machines (at least that's what I call them).  Help is friendly and plentiful, and in joining you get a fitness consultation that actually seems to be cluefull. The trainers and employees manage to treat people as adults and not as children or draft inductees. Both hand and bath towels are provided free of charge.  The childcare area is palatial as well, with plenty of toys and places to climb. The hours of coverage are ample. The girls and women who watch the kids actually act as though they enjoy their work.  And the atmosphere is a relief in that it's family- (and not douchebag- or creepazoid- ) centered. That's not to offend any douchebags or creepazoids out there. I'm sure there are places for you, too. In fact, I know there are. The crowd is neither very young nor very old, and no one seems to be intent upon laddering-up to the top of the gym social order.  About the only drawback to this place is that there are no benches in the locker rooms. Oh, and it can also get quite crowded at prime times, though not as badly as the LA Fitness location I also use.  It's definitely one of the better values in gyms in the area, and that's not even taking into account the opportunities for kid's sports and swim lessons, etc.

I echo everything Richard Z. says about the food. It sucks. It sucks enough that I had a violent reaction to seeing the smarmy-dick CEO on TV the other night. I just got a reminder of how lame their food is two nights before at the Tempe location, and I still mourned the loss of my $20.  How can Hooters get away with basically selling stuff that wouldn't be accepted at a school cafeteria?  Well, they have girls in tight outfits. That's how they get away with it. Not that they are attractive. In fact, locally it's only the Tempe location that seems to have a reliable supply of waitresses who don't pad their mustaches down with foundation make-up and don't in some way remind me of my mom.   So I applaud Richard on his generosity in giving 4-stars to this gaping wound on the soul of America. But I can't join him in his open-mindedness.   And here's why:  Hooters is nothing less than a titty-bar for henpecked husbands. Guys who can't go to see actual bare breasts at a gentleman's club for fear of landing in divorce court can indulge their fantasies of what life would have been like for them had the rubber not broken on that date ten years before just by going to Hooters. I can't remember the times I've been dragged to Hooters for lunch by groups of nice, married guys at work who will only refer to it as "that WINGS place" with a smutty grin. This is their little fun indulgence--their minor sin.  So I can't agree that Hooters "is what it is" and therefore deserves anything more than one star. It is a pallid imitation of something that we are still too repressed to acknowledge, and the insipid, revolting food makes it a total rip-off.

I love taking my 4-year-old there, but mainly on First Fridays when the admission is free.   It's always a terrific amount of fun for just about everyone. "Museum" is a bit of a misnomer. It's more like a very cool indoor playground full of interesting stuff.

It's a modern, well-lit, open place, the equipment is maintained, it's not over-subscribed, and most of all, IT IS CLEAN.  I used to belong to the LA Fitness at 20th and Camelback, and you can read my reviews to see why I felt compelled to leave. Lifetime is everything LA Fitness is not. Unfortunately that also means it's not close. I gladly drive the 15 miles or so up the 51 and across the 101 to get there a few times a week.  The most expensive gym membership is the one you don't use. Lifetime is more expensive than LA Fitness or some other clubs, but keep in mind what you get:  -real 24/7 availability -a good schedule of free classes -expanded childcare hours (and the children's area is like something from a dream. Rows of iMacs, a big habitrail, big-screen TV's showing Disney flicks, and actual gym classes for your kids) -pools both indoor and out, both with waterslides. The outdoor pool area is more or less like a resort. -a eucalyptus steam room -access to any of their clubs anywhere in the nation (I also use the one up in Colorado when I'm there)  So with these items combined with the fact that my son and I love going there whenever we can, the monthly toll isn't that bad.   This being North Scottsdale there is the expected assortment of posers of both sexes. They don't usually seem to get in the way of anything. Also, another typically-North Scottsdale feature is the regular conflicts in the parking lot among the entitlement-minded regarding speeds through the lot and who gets to park where. Gyms are basically temples of self, so nothing surprises me anymore.

I'll post a review of my one happy hour experience there. I intend to go back for more. Again and again.  The happy hour runs from 3 to 6, and it was suggested--no--urgently pleaded to me by other regulars that I go just for one dish available half-price during that time: The cheeseburger. It's honest-to-god prime rib ground on premises, served on a ciabatta roll with a selection of yam and potato fries.   And yes, it is delicious.   It was so delicious  that I want to go back to try the rest of the happy hour menu. It was so fully worth the $7 that I think I would have felt satisfied paying the full $14. I want to work my way through the menu and report back each time.  When you enter the hostess politely asks if you came only for drinks (most of which are half-price during HH) or food as well. If it's only drinks you get to sit in the hip-a-riffic wine bar to your left, where stylish Helmut-Newton-looking pictures of fabulous babes with wine wait to stimulate you. If you are going to avail yourself of the food menu you are directed to the Cadillac of lunch counters, where all places are set with fine linen and silverware. You get to watch chefs prepare your meal in front of you. Sound exotic? It's more like Kresge's circa 1974, but the experience of eating brilliant impeccable food from a five-and-dime lunch counter is thrilling in a way.  The downside--if there is one--is that there is basically none of the "vibe" that you'd get in a more sporty place. This is a nice, quiet, high-toned place, So maybe "happy hour" is a misnomer. Maybe it's more of a "Maslovian Elevation Hour", where one can sit and reflect that if one has time and means to enjoy a perfectly lovely prime-rib cheeseburger for $7, life isn't so bad after all.  So yes, thumbs up.

Excellent!   I was dealing with a cranky 5-year-old with a serious case of dry-mouth when I happened to see this place off to the East of 7th Street. I quickly parked, wandered in, and lo-and-behold: A genuine find!  The sign outside says 51 flavors, but there are 53 on the menu, and owner Jeff says that the real mathematical limit is something closer to 304. I was impressed with the blueberry plus cajun cream he whipped up.  The price for the medium is a very, very affordable $2.50. For that you get what appears to be about 32 heaping ounces of deliciously-flavored shaved ice. Take that, Scottsdale Gelati hang!  Try it. You'll like it!

Hey, I'm a hipster: I need my martini. So I bypassed the health-smoothies on the left side of the menu that were the focus of the waiter's spiel. They did look appealing I guess. But I wasn't in the mood for a spa experience.  So the martini came without olives. As did the kale and mushroom pizza on whole wheat crust.   But both tasted great. Even my kid thought enough of the kale pizza to eat half of it. He's four, and roasted kale is usually a hard sell.   Anyway, quick service, pleasant surroundings. Family-friendly enough to make me feel comfortable with my kid (despite the occasional stares of couples who probably have Childfree.org stickers on their BMW's, where the man is tallying stock options and the woman is trying to silence the wails of her empty and yearning womb. Of course I'm used to that.)  Anyway, I liked the place. I'll be back. I don't think I like it as much as I liked Coffee Plantation when it was in the same spot 15 years ago. But never mind this old fart. Sawgrass smoothies are where it's at today!

This is what a swank downtown lounge should be: Excellent service even on a busy Saturday night. Martinis made perfectly. Cheerful accommodation of special requests. Suitably swank architecture and decor (and patrons). I'm very glad I finally made it down to sample Hanny's, which was for years a men's clothing store, not a department store as some seem to believe.   I brought along a party of international colleagues who were hooked on Merc Bar from a prior visit. I wanted them to try something new. As we approached the entrance and opened the door, there was a collective sigh bordering on a gasp. This was exactly what the doctor ordered.   I'll hold back on the final star until I have a chance to sample their food, but I still recommend it to anyone looking for a swank experience in downtown Phoenix.

The location, atmosphere, and overall vibe is just right. It's like being in a moderately stylish, worldly friends house.   I had the chorizo dates as an appetizer. Delightful! These alone are enough to pull me back anytime I'm in town. The main course was pasta tossed with vegetables, recommended as the special (Vovo's favorite). It was delicious and satisfying as only really good food can be.  I was in a group with about ten other people. Raves from all of them as well.  This is a swell place off the beaten path in Phoenix and I highly recommend it.

It's been about 25 years I think.  For 25 years I've looked at Olive Garden the way that I look at white Chevrolets and JC Penney. An almost generic experience.   But you know, over a business lunch today I reflected how flawless the experience of Olive Garden really is. It's like what a Chevrolet or JC Penney should be, but neither is.  25 years ago I would have been marveling at America's new dedication to industrial rebirth and automation. GM was building cars with robots back then, you know. How beautiful the future looked. Automation! Computers! It was a second industrial revolution for America! Manufacturing was what America did well, by gum!  Well, nowadays most stuff is built in China. America's industrial base has shrunk. We still make planes and guns. And porn. But not a whole lot else.  And now, we have the clean and modern Olive Garden on Happy Valley Road, where I and my partner were greeted, seated, and beveraged within less than a minute, and attended to by a very pleasant  young server (and his pleasant trainee) who was fully versed in the menu and capable in  various varieties of small-talk. Within a reasonable time we were presented with our soup and salad, which was consistently prepared and reliably tasty.  For a main plate I ordered the Shrimp Primavera, which was delivered a perfect interval after the salad and soup course was finished. My friend had the Ravioli Alfredo, which looked delicious and got his thumbs-up. My dish was tasty enough, and the pasta was al dente. The shrimp were cooked just right--not overcooked and dried out as they usually are in other places. The breadsticks were well-presented--tightly wrapped and perfectly heated--and delicious.  During the course of the lunch our iced teas were refilled regularly, even by servers who weren't assigned to our table. There were regular checks on our welfare and our enjoyment of the meal.  Finally the check came, and given what we had consumed it was a very reasonable price. The waiter included a handwritten card thanking us, as well as a couple of Andes mints. I tipped him well.  There was nothing--NOTHING--to complain about. It was a wonderful lunch. It was full of positive feelings.   Except for this sobering realization, which probably only affects weird-asses like myself who just can't relax and enjoy:  Working in a place like Olive Garden is all that most of the new generation (like our waiter and his trainee and younger) will have to look forward to. It's what we as a nation still do well.   We serve precision-prepared breadsticks with a passion. And dammit, we do it well.   Try doing that over the Internet from India, you heartless capitalist assholes.

They know how to do meats.  I can't think of a single thing that wasn't great about this meal.  The only negative I can possibly think of is that nagging feeling in the back of my mind that it is just . . . too. . . . much. Just too much of everything. The whole experience constitutes a sort of embarrassment of riches.  But that's what celebrations are about, and thus this is a great place for a celebration.

"Uuhh. . . . eight . . . no . . . . uhhhh . . . . ten . . . make it ten  . . . ten tacos . . . "  "Sir. . . how many tacos?"   (rustling sound with a selection of masculine guffaws and feminine giggling)  "Ok, we've had a recount . . .  uhh. . . . . twelve. . . . twelve tacos. . . "  "Twelve tacos?"  "Yes, twelve . . . twelve tacos. . . "  "Ok your total is $6.78 at the window please pull forward."  "What?"  "Please pull forward."  "Ok."  "Welcome to Jack in the Box, can I take your order please?"  "You just did."   (Long silence)   "So can you pull forward?"   "Oh, I guess."   "Thank you!"  "Hey . . . you still there?"  "Sir, yes. . .  what can I get for you?"   "What time is it?"  (long silence)   "It's 2:40 AM"   "2:40 AM?"   "Yes. Please pull forward.   "Ok.. . . can I get napkins with that?"   "Yes. Please pull forward."   "Ok."

They've gotten better and better for me in the time since this review was written.   My last contact with them was a few days ago when I was having trouble redeeming some Groupons on their website. I called customer service and after waiting a few minutes I spoke with a rep who cheerfully booked four separate flights for me, patiently and manually entering my Groupon info for each one.  I think the acquisition by Republic has helped them overall. After Republic took over the in-flight cookies started. It still tends to suck if you aren't Ascent club (like just about any budget-centric airline does), but once you get there it's a good value. When I've had to fly Southwest or USAir I've been disappointed in comparison.

Hmm, didn't expect to like it very much, but actually. . . . it's not bad.  Happy hour runs from 3 to 7 every night and means almost everything on the menu is half-price. I enjoyed a decent vodka martini and shared a charcuterie board with my table. Later came the lamb chops and the hummus plate. All very good.  The wait staff is part of the attraction, and attractive they are.  Seems like it would turn into a bit of a meat-market and douche palace on weekends, but for this after-work get-together it was a positive experience.

The visit on this past Saturday night was worth it just to hear a band with an actual horn section.  You don't hear horn sections with lounge acts in Phoenix. Amazing! It was like I was at the Dunes in Vegas in 1969.   There are uniforms in use by not only the servers but also the patrons. Women are required to wear enough eye-makeup to cause them to resemble raccoons from a distance. Something resembling prom wear is also required. Men are to wear fitted dress shirts worn with the tails out and slightly-flared designer jeans with embroidery of some kind.  These are the uniforms required for the flirting activity, which to the outside observer resembles groups of women chattering with each other while men stand alone while holding drinks and looking "hard" and not talking to anyone.  Apparently, at some time in the past these maneuvers have resulted in the occasional successful sexual encounter, but perhaps not since its practitioners were in high school.

Dark, cool, comfy, and serving up some of the best fish-and-chips I've had in the Valley. Guinness with a shamrock on top. A good place to wait out the hottest part of the afternoon.   It probably isn't an "authentic" Irish pub, but that doesn't keep it from being a good experience.  Oh, and they serve breakfast, too!

Back when this place was Katz's Deli, I looked at the grungy, pallid walls, the worn vinyl booths, and the dreadful florescent lighting and thought to myself: "Wow, this place would look better gutted".   And yes, yes it does.  Nice brunch menu that's priced surprisingly well, comfortable atmosphere (and really nice booths), good coffee and service with a smile.   New favorite.

MIght be a bit more expensive than some other services, but get this: They show up on time, know what they are doing, and don't charge for a second visit if you need to think over the cost of the repair. In my case the total cost was LESS than what they had originally quoted, having found the necessary part for less in the day it took me to  decide to get it done.  So yes. Call them.

I'd call it an undiscovered gem, but it seems everyone I know has been urging me to go there for at least a year or two. So maybe I'm the only one who's out of it.  Great prices on delicious food for happy hour. Some of the best ceviche I've had North of the border. Guacamole that's going to jackslap you in the head. It's that good. Margarita is pretty good, too. Order the chicarron. Just do it. It comes out looking like a cooling tower at a nuke plant.  Service was swift and pleasant.   About the only drawback is that it's almost as noisy as a stamping plant. You know, like where they stamp big pieces of metal and stuff. Hard surfaces all around, and the music is pretty loud as well.   If you go check out the tribute to the late journalist Don Bolles in the hallway leading past the restrooms. It was on a Summer afternoon in 1976 that a bomb planted in his car in the parking lot of the Clarendon Hotel went off, morally wounding him. It's honorable that the management remembers the event, and definitely makes the Gallo Blanco a stop on the Mondo Phoenix tour.

An idol of my youth whose best times are probably behind it, sadly.  I've been there so many times for special occasions. It's always seemed like the real core of the Valley to me. The grounds and main halls are still beautiful and are maintained with a reverence that is befitting a national landmark.  But as a place to stay . . . . ya know. . . there's a newer Hilton not so far away. And the Marriott Buttes are really nice. Out in North Scottsdale and Carefree they have some really great places, too.  Your experience of the Biltmore will depend entirely on two factors: How much you have to spend, and in which section your room resides.  The newer casita section is nice and feels modern and premium. The rooms that were built-up in the 50's and 60's are less so, but still nice in their modernist way. The rooms in the main building would seem to be the real catch, but only for those with an historical interest. The world does hotel rooms differently now than they did in the 1920's, and there are some elements of the layout that can't be changed--like needing to walk a block or so (partially through a carpeted lobby)  to get to the pool.  Also, if you happen to get a deal on the rooms at their Summertime rate (which can be a great savings) keep in mind that you'll also be paying over $12 for a plain bagel and plain coffee at the on-site Starbucks. Unlike at many other hotels, there's no way to just pop across the street to get something more reasonable. You'll likely need to drive a mile or so to get to the slightly less-expensive Biltmore Fashion Park or the businesses along Camelback Road. And it can get tiring if you decide to self-park instead of availing yourself of the valet parking (which rings in at a modest $20 per day plus gratuity), because the self-parking areas can be a real hike.   So if you have the dosh to hang with the elite crowd--or just a really fat expense account and an understanding boss or controller--then I'm sure it can be a suitably swank experience. And you know Clark Gable and Rita Hayworth and the Reagans and all of them stayed there. However, at that level of $wank, there are other choices that are a bit more accommodating.

I'm a sucker for places that re-use modernist architecture I remember from my youth (see The Vig, etc). This place used to be the delightfully tacky yet unrefined Salon De Venus beauty parlor. Now it's a different sort of parlor. A pizza parlor. Get it? Good. Check out the naked lady wallpaper in the bathrooms.  I hear it's owned by the same people who brought us Nello's. Not a bad association at all.  I am probably biased by the fact that it's within stumbling distance from me, but this is one of my favorite happy hour and lunch spots in Phoenix. Everything I've tried on the menu has been impressive. Of course, because I myself am tacky-yet-unrefined my choices only have gone as far as pizzas, but pizza in itself can obviously pose a great challenge.  Go and enjoy.

I'm really trying to just grin and bear it as I gradually perceive that the equipment isn't being refreshed and the locker rooms/showers just aren't getting cleaned. I'm on the verge of giving up. Going there--no matter how convenient--is becoming a chore.   They need to steam-clean the showers and bathrooms regularly. The place isn't open 24/7 so it shouldn't be a big deal. Most of the carpet also needs to be replaced following the pool leak. The musty smells are getting to be too much.

I cancelled due to the problems with the facility I mentioned earlier. Hell, I think almost everyone has had the same problems with this place.  They give you two ways of canceling: Via US mail (they print out a form, you provide the envelope and stamp) or in-person during the 9-6 business day Monday-Friday when one of the managers is on duty. Why I couldn't cancel online in real time or in person during the weekend? No one knew. At least they were cheerful about it.  In the end nothing much had changed despite complaints from me and I am sure many other members. The locker room  and shower area is still dirty, the floor is still filled with a lot of rickety treadmills, and it's still probably worth the $30/mo for the determined, but not if you don't feel like going.

After years of being hacked at by one or the other of various former WalMart greeters at the neighborhood SuperClipTeamCuts franchise, I decided to stop letting pipe-hitting vagrants hack at my head with scissors in something resembling a grand-mal seizure, after which I would give them $10 and a prayer card. I decided to go global, as a hipster urbanist (aging or not) eventually must.  Donnie Blair is the man with the plan and he knows how to texturize. I leave looking a lot more like a US Senator and less like a Jerry Springer guest who recently fended off a chair attack, looking forward to a tepid shower in my trailer wherein I might rub my head with a bar of "Great Value" minty green soap before taking in an evening of Hee-Haw reruns accompanied by long chats on Yahoo masquerading as "Donita", a hormonal 13-year old.   That's not me. I am more like a US Senator.  The clientele is varied. Some rich old golfing bastards (suspiciously like myself); some genteel old maidens who don't know what a DVD is; Some stylish young dudes, and some wild young thangs of both genders.   This is R Salon: It's our salon.

It depends on what you're looking for I guess. I was putting together a new household and needed housewares and the various crapstuffs to make my house seem more like a home. Also I would have liked to have found some toys and furniture for the boy.  It's pretty well picked over, and for the most part priced . .  um . . . optimistically.   The Goodwills vary greatly from location to location. The store on Chandler Boulevard in Ahwatukee foothills gets some really nice cast-offs. I have a feeling this one on 16th St. is in an area where there's too much competition from other thrifts for good donations, and where shopping thrift stores is so well-accepted that they can still drive their prices up on whatever stuff they get.   I think there's a condition in the DSM-IV called "Thrift Store Delusion Complex" wherein people willingly pay prices nearly equal to new and think they're getting a deal. I'm all for helping the disadvantaged, but the idea of a thrift store is  . . . ahem . . . thrift.

So the drinks are ok and the food is fine and it's conveniently located and the service is good.  So what doesn't work about this place?  The very notion of postmodern clear-surfaced restraint applied to the inherent and necessary tackiness of a tiki bar. That's what doesn't work.  Tiki bars aren't places you see profiled in Modern Architecture. They are the bottom of the barrel of grandiose American bourgeois self-indulgence. Yeah, and the drinks should be exotic and strong. That goes without saying. But you can have a Zombie or a Dr. Funk of Tahiti in any Hilton. You go to a tiki bar to remind yourself of how tacky previous generations were in their attempts to stretch beyond the blandness of plaid polyester slacks from JC Penney and Oldsmobile 88's without leaving Des Moines.    To appreciate the tiki bar today we must approach with irony. However, Hula represents an irony in itself: A contradiction that is unresolved and leaves one asking "why?"

First of all, there is nothing wrong with this place. It's a state-of-the-art coffee shop that offers all the popular items at good prices. Go there and enjoy. Visit in conjunction with a trip to the Art Museum, Phoenix Little Theatre or the main library. Drop by after getting some Thai food on the corner. It's a nice place. . . .   But . . .  :-)  I had a few thoughts while enjoying an iced Americano today. The table that holds the sugar and cream and stirrers near the counter is some relic of a machine shop: an adjustable-height table of very heavy construction, with dials and massive casters and a requisite amount of patina. It looks splendid in its unpretentious way. It was designed and built and used for years as a genuine tool in an industrial surrounding. And in its prosaic and rugged simplicity it stands for something that nothing else in the place can claim. It's real, whereas the finished plywood on the walls, the welded girders under the tables, the exposed cinder blocks of the walls are merely "authentic".  And as I sat pondering this today, slowly drinking my Americano (itself a relic of the sort of conundrum I was pondering) something occurred to me:   Authenticity is to reality what margarine is to butter.  Something that strives for authenticity is just as artificial (perhaps moreso) than things that just strive to be entertaining, or good-tasting, or intriguing in some way. There's no more "reality" in something that's synthetically and self-consciously "authentic" than in something like Taco Bell or Olive Garden. There is actually LESS reality in anything contrived to be "authentic" with even a small amount of self-consciousness.  And so I recalled stuff from the late sixties and early seventies--when "authenticity" first seemed to ride a wave into the popular consciousness and everyone wanted to wear granny glasses and finish their own furniture. And I realized something:  American culture has been a fraud for the last 40 years or so.  Go and enjoy. This place leads to great thoughts.

What a great way to spend Easter morning!  After taking part in the egg hunt on the main grounds (and BTW, they know how to do it here: Massive dumps of eggs full of goodies. More than the kids could carry. Plenty of photo ops. Parents who weren't acting out scenes from Soylent Green.) we made our way to this nicely upscale coffee shop/casual dining spot.   We were seated 30 minutes ahead of our reservation, keeping my little guy from popping a gasket. I chose the $19 breakfast buffet, and considering it included a custom-made omelette with organic ingredients--as well as juice and coffee--it was a steal.   Service was wonderful and the staff was sure to make us feel at home. Well, actually better than home because I don't have people looking after my every whim and need while at home.

Great selection of wines (and beer and liquor) of every description, people who know their stuff, a good selection of well-priced cigars, ample hours, and within walking distance.   What's not to like?

They quoted me the best cash price in town for a windshield replacement, arrived at my house on-time, completed the work quickly, left the car clean and intact, and even transferred the service stickers from the old glass to the new.  Two thumbs-up.

What's to like about this funky geodesic-dome-looking hold-over from the 1960's?  Lots of things:  Drink deals. Tall doubles for $3.50 on the wells the night we were there. They have Stella and some other good beers on tap.  Live music and cool DJ's.  The don't-give-a-fuck feel of a skid row place.  A wild variety of regulars of every race and persuasion.  Some old gay guys didn't get the memo that it's no longer a gay club, so they hang around anyway. They're not out to get you.  Go if you know what a dive looks like and enjoy the atmosphere of a dive. This isn't a place to pose. It's a place to drink cheaply and hear some different tunes, and talk to people with a different outlook on life.  What's not to like about this place?  The pool table is positioned so you need to place the cue between people sitting at the bar to make half of your shots.

Still a fan of the music and overall vibe. One of the few bars in this part of town doing special events (i.e. Zombie-walk wrap party, themed music nights, that sort of thing)  I've noted that the later it gets, the gayer it gets. It starts off as predominately hipster and as Midnight approaches seems predominately gay.   Not that there's anything wrong with that, mind you . . .

I started going there just because it's nearby, but now it's become a bit of a destination for me.  I find the atmosphere is just right, and this time of year (early Fall) they keep the rollup doors open allowing interior to flow into the patio area--though flies can get annoying. They also have good WiFi with power outlets thoughtfully provided all around the long bench area. It's a good place to camp out with a laptop and work or browse for a bit, which is frequently what draws me there.   Upon entering I always get a whiff of something delicious. This varies through the day. In the morning it's bacon. Lunchtime smells like bbq. Dinner can smell like chorizo.  The kitchen in an open area where you can see -- and smell -- everything as it happens.  The sandwiches are larger than most people's heads and ingredients are very good. I enjoy the cold turkey sandwich on wholegrain with the guacamole.  The chilaquiles aren't really chilaquiles. They aren't the ones I remember from student days in Mexico. They're more like tostadas.  Taste good enough, but a bit disappointing.  Service is always good. The music can be a bit loud, but the selections are appropriate for the kind of place.  All in all, one of my favorite places in the area morning, noon and night.

Yes! This is what a bar should be: Tufted vinyl booths up on risers, dark woods, good martinis, and good deals on happy hour foodstuffs. It's the sort of homey, relaxed ambiance that makes it easy to relax. Great as the first or last stop on a date night. Go here and use the Yelp deals.

I would give 4 stars for the food and 2 for the service. That should balance out to a 3, but I am disappointed enough right now to not feel generous at the moment.  Everything I've eaten here on multiple visits has been delicious: Rich, real flavors. None of the acidic aftertaste of McDonald's/Burger King/Wendy's. The ice cream is reason enough to go in and of itself. Everything on the menu works as comfort food.  And I've enjoyed it all, once I have gone through the labors of Hercules to finally get what I ordered.  Today in the drive-thru they managed to ask my drink order on 5 different occasions, and still got it wrong. Medium Diet Pepsi and a small Sierra Mist. It's almost a mantra for me now. I was given fries after twice specifying onion rings. My kid wanted ketchup for his chicken tenders and got nothing instead. And there were no napkins in the bags.   At other times they have omitted parts of orders placed inside, or sent me something that had nothing to do with what I had ordered. The help has noted the mistakes by nodding in some sort of brain-dead daze and wandering off in the distance.  I guess it must be rocket science.   So if you have time and stress to burn, go to Culvers and be rewarded with some really good flavors.

I brought in a rim mounted with an old tire and a new tire I had bought online. Ten minutes and twenty bucks later, I was on my way.  These guys are sharp, quick, inexpensive and courteous. Finding this combination in the powersports industry is so rare that most consider it impossible.  They also sell tires and will do a full tire change without your needing to remove the wheels--at an extra charge. This is one of the few shops I would trust to do that for me.

Very nice atmosphere, especially now that it's cool enough for them to leave the tall windows open. The whole restaurant area feels open to the world. Very pleasant colors as well.  We came for happy hour and the menu didn't disappoint. Good selection of rolls and sushi and various non-sushi dishes for $3-$5. All we tried were good and tasted fresh. When ordering sushi on some special at other places, I sometimes wonder if they don't have a few baker's trays full of the stuff somewhere, leftover from a morning prep session. That wasn't the case here.  Drinks on special included Dos Equis for $4 and the house red or white for $3, as well as various cocktails. I wouldn't recommend the wine, actually: Bears distinct hints of "3 Buck Chuck". My companion had the Summer Sumo which was reported to be pretty satisfying.   No complaints on the service. We were very well-attended over the course of over a 90 minute stay.  This is a good place to start the evening if you're doing a datenight at the Biltmore or Esplanade.

Get this: So I walk in looking for a bottle of an artichoke liqueur I remembered drinking in Italy 15 years before. I ask the older, somewhat dour, cardigan-wearing guy behind the front counter. He squints, wrinkles his nose, and says "Oh that? Yes, that's TERRIBLE stuff! It's right over there on that shelf. It probably has dust on it."   That was just perfect. It's why I go to a place like Sportsman's instead of some mass-market warehouse dealio. I LIKE dour old guys in cardigans who know everything about their subject and share candidly.   So yes, would recommend. Will go back. Will cry whenever they close after that corner center is turned into yet another shiny granite office building.

One of the better fro yo experiences I've had in the valley. As others have found it's usually very clean and the help is very helpful, offering free samples and what have you.   Mojo is more colorful and interesting inside, but there's no real reason to prefer it over this.

"It is better to look good, than to serve good. . . "   First of all, the burgers are very good. I ordered mine medium, and that's how it actually arrived. Not many places will actually cook a burger to order. Maybe they SAY they will, but no. The fries (both sweet potato and regular) were tasty. So no real complaints about the food.  But . . . COME ON Sam Fox. . . you can't just put model-looking women out there as servers and hostesses, have them take far too long to seat us because they couldn't figure out which tables were open, deny that a special was being offered (until I showed the email for it on my phone),  have them take 10 minutes or so to bring a glass of wine, delay a simple food order by about 20 minutes or so, repeatedly neglect water and drink refills, forget that the burger was ordered without a bun, and expect customers not to notice because they've been blinded by an abundance of voluptuary feminine goodness. I've gotten better service at actual stripjoints that served food.   So, not really a fan. Maybe caught them on a bad night (though the Tuesday night crowd didn't seem like it would have been too imposing). I might give them another chance, but then if I'm paying $11 for a burger ala carte, basically everything needs to be perfect to convince me to go back. Smashburger and 5 Guys are just down the street, and I'd rather not pay for the pretention of service.

This place is a haven for architecture buffs, especially those with an interest in mid-century modern stuff. The renewal of the old Arizona Bank branch has yielded a wonderful open, naturally bright-but-not-too-bright  human space. The area with the bocce court feels like an ideal patio straight out of Sunset magazine or something.  They have one of the better happy hour menus around. A favorite of mine is the Indian flatbread (with the tastes of tandoori chicken and chutney). Good deals on drinks as well.  The Saturday-Sunday brunch is served from 10 to 2 each day, and there's a whole lot of creativity going on with the items offered. I've never had a bad dish here.  Complaints? Well, no self-parking during busy times--all valet. At least these guys know how to drive a stick. That's not always the case.

The "hood" is a colloquialism not intended to imply "ghetto" or any particularly dangerous neighborhood. I am a proud resident of the Biltmore 'hood and my neighbors are retired Mormon doctors who all own corgis and drive Buicks and have umbrellas with "Vanguard Investments" emblazoned on them.  Anyway, even though the neighborhood isn't particularly risky it's dangerous just having this place so close to me. After a particularly harsh day at work I treated myself to the carne asada burro combo. Highly addictive, and there's probably enough fat in the tortilla alone -- never mind the filling -- to keep me and an African village or two going for a week or so. Nevertheless, it's delicious and a great antidote to an evening spent with too much single-malt and too many cigars and some women named Wanda and Clarissa. Those who know . . . . know . . .   Anyway, go and enjoy.

Totally unpretentious, small, very casual, interestingly-named, family-operated, and offering good values on large portions of delicious food.   Thus: A keeper!  Two things to note before you go: There are only 6 4-top tables so reservations are recommended. Also, no liquor license, so it's BYOB with a $5-per-bottle corking fee. The side-salad options on the menu are kinda confusing at first. Keep in mind that they don't combine the separate items in a bowl: You are essentially ordering three separate small side dishes served on the same plate as the main course.   Business is good enough that they're talking about expanding to a larger location, which would be nice. I hope they can keep the same qualities that make their place a must-visit today.

Small, hidden, relatively unknown, and a really nice place for a late afternoon rendezvous with someone you'd rather not everyone know you are seeing. ;-)  It's as close in style, size and content to a real European bistro as I have seen around here.  Stick to the pizza and mozzarella and wine and you can't go wrong. I did have a pasta dish there for dinner once that was unimpressive.

There's a formula to this sort of place and Wolfley's seems to get it right.  Nice atmosphere, good wings, good service, and a nicely rounded-out menu. There's enough space in the main dining area to accomodate large groups. I'm glad they've made good use of the space once used by The Office.

Go there.   Straight-up diner food at good prices served with a smile in a comfortable and spacious area. The coffee is the real stuff, not the office coffee that's starting to creep back into most places.   The proprietor is also the real deal: Meet him and you will decide that what America really needs is an army of entrepreneurs like Joe.

What can't be faulted: Food and coffee are terrific. Especially the coffee. Also, I have been seated very quickly at each visit. The servers are delightfully cheerful and Joe himself comes out to speak to each table directly. It's a high-quality, old-school diner experience and well-worth the minimal price.  What is a bit of an annoyance: By applying all of that personalized service, the speed of the service suffers when they are even a bit busy. I don't believe Joe has enough help behind the line, and it's probably further hurt by his zeal for customer interaction. And it seems that maybe order turnaround time might be slowed by the apparent lack of any  computerized order management/POS system. When get your check you're supposed to pay your server, but if she's not around and you go to the front desk (because you need to get on with things), you won't find a dedicated cashier. Just a hostess. Who is very nice and cheerful.  It could be that this is how long service took back in the day, and I have been spoiled (with the other members in my party) by the super-speedy almost-flawless delivery of cold, corporate places like Chili's, Denny's, Applebee's, and other places who have teams of industrial engineers and MBA's to hone their model. In that case I fault myself.  I barely remember how things were back in 1978 or whenever.  I remain a fan and will return, but will need to keep in mind that Joe's requires more of a time investment than do other places.

Excellent service from Brian and Dave following a small kitchen flood that leaked into the bedroom. They were the first service I called that could give me a firm time for an appointment, then beat that time. Couldn't have pleased me more because the smell was getting really rank.   Anyway, these are the guys you want. Prompt service, quick call-backs, good equipment, and no upselling to special carpet protectant made from unborn virgin goat eyelids or whatever.

After enjoying the food at their Tukee location a few times, I wondered if  the same flavors were available at their North Phoenix location. And happily, yes, they are. This is good stuff. There's a certain kick and complexity to the taste that you don't get in even the hearty Mexican drive-thrus like Filiberto's and such. It makes the extra cost seem worth it.  And note that I am comparing this, a relatively nice sit-down-type place, to  Filiberto's. Any comparisons to Garcias or other pre-fab GringoMex outlets aren't fair. To the GringoMex, I mean. LT blows them out of the water.  Anyway, they care about their food and it shows. The decor here is much better than in Tukee, which seems more or less like a taco shop set up in a hall closet. They even have a bar with a happy hour at this location.  The prices are higher than expected, but not extraordinary.  BTW: I think the photogenic nature of the counter help probably helped the place get that shot on Drive-in's Diners and Dives. Just sayin . . .

I'm enthusiastic about any place that manages to both be conscious of the caloric values of what they put on the plate AND the variety and tates of foods offered. And that's what Seasons 52 does.  Nothing on the menu goes above 450 calories or so, and the server will guide you on real values.  The menu changes through the year, focusing on what is truly in season (thus the Seasons 52).   I had the flatbread for lunch and found it delicious and filling at only 400 calories or so. The service was quick and the surroundings were nice. Back in 1992 I was a starving student, so I don't recall how "nice" restaurants looked back then. Maybe they looked like this?  I think we need more of this. It's a health-conscious restaurant that doesn't seem like penance. I plan to go back.

Happy hour with $5 well drinks and a nice assortment of discount munchies.   But most importantly. . . . a crowd that smilingly, laughingly indulges a couple of old 40-somethings laughing and almost making out on a couch.  So don't go if you don't want to see people with crows-feet acting like teenagers on a date.

The burgers were good. The service was receptive and responsive. The atmosphere was appropriately laid-back. And although this was my first visit to this location (my fourth or fifth to all locations in the "chain") I think I can say that I "get it" now.  When people complain about typical chain restaurants they usually fault their faultlessness: i.e. Everything tastes the same from one location to another, no one item on the menu stands out (as good OR bad), the help is trained in standard service techniques which bar the display of any real personality, and so on.   So I think it's interesting when the same people who avoid chains for their flawless, smooth symmetry will nag a place that diverges from that faultlessness while still providing what's generally a satisfying experience.   Two Hippies isn't Applebee's or Denny's.  It's more or less what I would call "amateurish", if only it were possible to use that word without any negative overtones.  The spirit of the place is expressed in enthusiasm and rough-and-ready improvisation. Like this: "Hey man, let's grill burgers and make fries and sell the combo for like $5 or $6. We don't need a drink fountain. C'mon--let's just do it. Look at that house over there. We could sell them out of there. Put a porch on it. Get some benches from Home Depot. Yeah."  So to me--having been raised listening to independent records and hearing a steady stream of entrepreneurial ideas from both of my parents--the spirit of Two Hippies seems charming and energizing. The occasional blips in service and lack of uniformity only adds to the attraction.  And you are free to disagree.

On the plus side, they: A) serve wine and beer, B) Give you a place and an atmosphere to sit and talk about the movie before and after in the lounge area external to the auditorium C) give us film buffs a place to see alternative cinema on a big screen.  The only negatives are that their projector isn't quite up to the standards of Harkins or AMC, so the picture has a sort of back-projection TV feeling to it. I grant that this could have been inherent to the film I saw (Thirteen Assassins), but then the trailers and announcements had the same sort of partial dullness to the image. I know that high-end digital projectors must run into the hundreds of thousands, so I won't dwell on this shortcoming.  Anyway, a good addition to the downtown scene.

Second visit confirms that it's probably the nicest converted former gas station I've ever dined in. The views of Camelback mountain and the overall architectural feel of the place can't be faulted. Makes one marvel at the foresight of whomever laid out the original Enco gas station back in 1960 or whenever it was first established.   Kinda reminds me of the Vig in overall feel, menu, and aesthetic. Not a bad point of comparison at all. There was music on the patio (guitarist doing good covers of things like "Long Train Running") that wafted through the open roll-up doors.  The "Deluxe" burger is covered in sauteed mushrooms and is fairly good, though I sense that the patty is pre-formed and not hand-formed on site. There are some interesting appetizer items available.   Service was quick and without complaint.  The wine list is probably the biggest attraction among the offerings, though a full bar is available as well. For happy hour the wines are discounted by $2 per glass. You can get some fairly interesting stuff here (We ordered a bottle of pretty good cab sauv).  I see this place as a destination for Sunday morning bike rides down the canal.

Is this place actually supposed to be . .  . you know. . . . a business?  We showed up at about 7 on a Tuesday, putting us in the no-mans land between happy hours. That part didn't matter much to me, but as we seated ourselves I wondered if we might be catching them in a dead spot. Maybe that explains the rest of the review. I'm not anxious to try again. At any time.  We chose to sit in the bar area where more of the tables were full than in the restaurant area. We were just there for a couple drinks and some apps.  The waitress shows up and my friend asks what they have on tap. The waitress recites a voluminous list from memory, blandly. However, neither of us could hear her well enough over the Brian Adams or some other droning shit they had playing too loudly in the background. My friend asks to see a printed beer list. The waitress--a bit perplexed--explains that they don't have printed beer lists. My friend settles for water and starts searching "Zipps Phoenix Beers" on her iPhone. On the other hand,  I--determined to get my drink on--order up a vodka tonic and throw in an order of some wings.  We wait.  I get my drink. The tonic water is flat as a stretch of Nebraska Interstate. Waitress comes back around. I tell her that it's not working for me and since I suspect that their tonic has gone flat, I order a vodka Diet Coke instead. She apologizes and takes the drink away. A few minutes later she's back with the Diet Coke and vodka.   Which is also flat.   And apparently made with "vodka" made from straining Sterno through gym socks.   Waitress is now off in the distance carting around dishes. I try to wave her down. No response. I take it to the bar. Bartender not paying attention. I look back to our table. The waitress is back, but empty-handed. My friend is now searching various blog entries from 2007 looking for hints of which beers they offer besides . . . y'know . . . fuckin' Bud Light, which might be all they usually sell.  I decide to have a beer instead, taking the time to walk back to the bar to look at the taps. I order an IPA.  My friend says "oh, that sounds  . . . ok . . . ". Ok then: Two. Make it two IPA's. The waitress slowly walks off, carting with her the last abortive attempt at a cocktail and our inspired beer order.  We wait.   I look over at the kitchen and was reminded of an order for some wings placed way back . . . oh. . . .a couple of screwed-up drink orders before. Seems like sometime back during the days of Weimar Republic by this point.  I notice that although the bar area is well-occupied, the restaurant area is basically empty. I don't see any orders up on the kitchen window. Servers and the cooks are standing around talking. I look at my friend across the table. We look at the bar, and back at the kitchen. No beers. No wings. The taste of two lousy drinks still on my tongue. A gradually-accumulating wave of bitter resentment rising within me.  We got up and left. The Garage was right across the street and was everything that Zipps wasn't this night.  In a word: A business.

Good bet for Happy Hour in the Biltmore.   Nice menu featuring a fairly impressive margarita (even though that's not my usual drink). There are good prices on the food items as well, though the $5 chicken skewers tasted a bit glued-together, at least the chipotle sauce was good.   Service was good and without complaint.  The patio area has a certain comfortable vibe to it-- like it's just exposed enough.

I got a great full hour of treatment from Christine that hurt like hell (like it's supposed to) and now I feel like I can turn my head freely from side to side.   Was I a bit stressed and tight? Yes, I think so. I'm better now.  Take advantage of the Yelp deal while they still have it. This is a good massage.  About the only criticism is that free parking is a bit tight. Usually some metered spots are available along 4th Avenue.

Hey, it's been a few visits since my update.   I can tell you that Christine has continued to outperform expectations, and others I've sent her way have confirmed it by becoming regulars themselves.  One appreciated feature: Art of Touch is entirely cyber-inter-connected. So you can make appointments via email (you are sent a Google calendar invite to confirm when you set it up) and get your receipts that way, as well.   Thumbs up.

It's hipsteriffic.   I knew by the way the tenspeeds were racked that this would be a PBR-and-plaid sort of place, and I wasn't disappointed.  What I liked about it: The DJ was loud as hell but isolated to the front lounge section. If there's no band playing in the ballroom part, one can wander back there to have an actual conversation. Also, no cover.  What I didn't like about it: I don't think there was much vodka in that vodka tonic.  Still, not a bad place to hang out. Some nice eye-candy and it's within walking distance to Seamus McAffrey's and Hanny's.

You haven't lived until you have heard impromptu-Samoan-Christian-gangsing at a Chinese buffet.   And I am glad I was there to witness it.  It's reliable. Nothing bad or gross. They have the sushi (just ok) and reasonably-good Mongolian BBQ. The main dishes are consistently tasty and fresh. It's rather clean. If you have the Val-Pak app on your phone, you can get 15% off your total check.   Check out the koi pond with the turtles.

My Indian co-workers and friends swore by this place, and it really is pretty good.   I should educate myself on the varieties of food served, but the things that resembled crepes were really good. And that stuff that looks like spinach. Oh, and the spicy potatoes. It was a very filling and delicious lunch!  Anyway, between this and Udupi Cafe (don't let my ignorance of the names of the cuisine convince you that I don't know what I like. I just don't know what to call it), I think Udupi serves up the hotter and spicier entrees, while this one served dishes I hadn't experienced before.  I'd return, and next time will probably take notes. Or pictures. Or something.

A very nice experience overall.   The auditorium was clean, the sound and picture flawless. Our seats resembled the front seats out of modern Volvo or a Gulfstream. Very comfortable. The middle armrest of each pair of seats lifts to get out of the way if you are in the mood for some PDA. Towards the front of the theater there were other seats that resembled office chairs on wheels, and were pushed up against a desk-height counter. We didn't try them but I think the experience in those would be significantly less pleasant.  The food was actually not bad. I paid about $12 for a half-pound burger with cheese and 'shrooms, served with sweet potato fries. The $9 martinis weren't really that impressive, only being filled about 2/3rd of the way.   Service was prompt and efficient, and the staff does a good job of not getting in the way of the picture.  I went there with the Groupon ($6 for ticket and softdrink). At that price it's a steal, though I would consider going back even at the full price.

Ordinarily I wouldn't bother, but when I pull in for a fill-up and find that one island's pay terminal is not working at all (with taped-up handwritten signs that look like they have been there since Rikki Lake was still on daytime TV) and the other island's pay terminal is only accepting credit cards on one side, and when I try to enter my pump number at that one, single, solitary functioning terminal, it tells me pump 4 is busy when it obviously BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT is not (because I can see it still holstered about 12 feet away from me), I just gotta say something.  The prices on the gas are good. Too bad you can't buy it.

I really, really, really hope this place makes it. It is absolutely crazy in some ways, but brilliant in others. I am sticking with 4 stars as a confession of my  personal enthusiasm, but before you go you should probably read the rest of the review.  It's in the old Fuji buffet location, which for many, many years before was a wonderfully tacky and over-the-top Chinese palace with tons of neon outside and something resembling a moat.  The glory of that old place is sadly long-gone, but thankfully so is the mediocre trough-brau that replaced it sometime in the mid-nineties. I never liked Fuji.  So now in its latest incarnation we have the same building painted fire-engine red with cheap-ass looking giant yellow letters and some attempt at an outside bistro area that looks like it will probably remain a pigeon perch. That's a shame because it will probably drive away some customers who might otherwise enjoy what lies within.  And what lies within is a startling melange of foods from not only the Mediterranean, but also India and--with several varieties of Jello--Iowa. They have dolmades, they have pork-chops with a tangy tomato sauce, they have Greek Goulash, they have paneer, they have curries, they have alfredo, and they kebabs that look and eat more like sausages, they have orzo, they have fried rice, and they have several varieties of chicken dishes. And they have a bunch of other stuff. And it is all--as far as I can tell--delicious.   The chef himself came out to show me around at lunch today. He took great pride in his creations. His accent made me think he was Greek, which would make sense. Greeks tend to go overboard with this sort of thing. Greeks know how to run restaurants. Sometimes they know how to keep them open.  Lunch is $7.99. For kids it's $3.99.  Go in with an open mind and ignore the desolate and half-assed fittings on the outside and inside. Ignore the lack of door closers on the entryway (I had to get up and manually close them twice). Ignore the interior tackiness. Relish in what is on the buffet line and appreciate fact that you can eat your way around the world in this little corner of the Camelback Corridor.  Then go next door and buy a treadmill and some freeweights.

Well, of course it's 5 stars. How many other Phoenix Police Museums are there? This is it, and it's as good as it gets.  Really, it's worth a visit if you can fit one into their 9-3 M-F schedule. Free admission, and if you have kids they'll get to wear real Phoenix PD shirts and play in a retired patrol car and on a meter-maid's 3-wheeler. There are dioramas showing the evolution of the department from the horse-and-buggy days to modern times of bomb-squad robots and body armor. It's rather small but nicely arranged, and part of one exhibit pays tribute to Phoenix as the birthplace of the Miranda rights read to each suspect  nationwide for the last 45 years as they are being wrestled into the back seat of a cruiser: "You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say . . . "  Interesting gift shop area as well.

Just what the neighborhood needed: A family restaurant open long hours with a real bar and a nice patio.  Breakfast menu features a nice selection of omeletes and pancakes among other things. It's served until 4PM. The coffee is very good.   It's not cheap, but you tend to get what you pay for.  No real downside perceived here. I'll be back.

A pleasant-enough happy hour experience. It's got a nice, dark wood feeling inside that was comforting on a hot afternoon.  The happy hour menu isn't necessarily "cheap" but the food items were good, and  the wine choices interesting. The wings with the habanero sauce were tasty. I heard great things about the pork belly and jam sandwich. Service was good.  The music is a bit too loud, and for a place like this, a soundtrack featuring Coldplay and Jack Johnson (the hits of 2003) seemed a little off. We were two of 6 customers for Happy Hour, so it's likely that things like loud background music were more noticeable than they might have been otherwise.

What a great happy hour (ok, they prefer to call it "social hour") experience!  Good selection of wines divvied up into different price points between 5 and 10 bucks a glass. Wells for 4. A selection of small plates that are really quite impressive.  Service and atmosphere are top-notch. The feeling inside is bright, airy, and open.   New destination. You come too!

Tuesday night is not the night to go to Gypsy Bar.  Friday is better. Saturday better still.  On Tuesday nights you will likely be one of five people in the audience listening to an elderly, heavy-set woman belting out a Rihanna song accompanied by a Karaoke track. You won't see artists in the mini-stages set into the walls. Neither will you see go-go dancers. Those things are reserved for the weekends.  If you go on a Friday or Saturday you'll get City Scape's closest approximation of a "scene"--with drink prices to match. It's not really LA yet, but it's trying.

I remember when this place was Flint British Motors. Forget the Kawasaki/Ducati days: That's newbie stuff. I remember looking at Spitfires and MG's under that enormous awning. Remember them? Stopped selling them in the early 80's.  Anyway, the food's as good as one might expect from Sam Fox. The service isn't the fastest, but keep in mind the utter enormous size of the place. On a Monday night our server (who looked like a model, in keeping with the Sam Fox MO) had to tend to a sparse crowd spread across something close to a city block. The server kept her cheery demeanor despite looking forward to running the equivalent of a 5K on her shift under the nicely-cooled awning.  When the food arrived it was delicious. No complaints from anyone in our party. Try the fried chicken. It was not only the special, but it was actually special.  Yes, they have games. I guess they're fun. I lack hand-eye coordination so I limit my fun activities to motorcycles and guns. But have at it!  Parking is valet-assisted. When it gets busy you're going to want to use it. Parking in front of Planned Parenthood and running across 7th Street is a bit unseemly.

By its name I had expected it to be kinda dour, simple, good-quality, and cheap. I expected low-key service from unassuming staff in clean uniforms. Because "Dutch", you see? The Dutch are cheap and dour.    What do I get?  I get an expensive, subaverage cup of coffee served up by the cast of a Summerstock production of "Godspell".   I think whereas Starbux has mined the ranks of disillusioned business and communications majors who found their BS's and BA's bought them nothing but sorrow and attitude, Dutch Bros seems to have camped out at the exit line at graduation from gender studies and art therapy programs.   I'll tell you what: I don't think I'm the only one around who would patronize a drive-thru called "No Shit: Just Coffee". I am sure there are millions upon millions of people who would go out of their way for that.  "No Shit: Just Coffee". Someone. Take it and run with it.

Sushi on a conveyor!! What more do you need to know?  Need to know more? Ok my son and I sat there for a half hour grabbing plates at random off the belt. I didn't bother checking prices. I like to live dangerously. The damage at the end, when we were both full of sushi? About 15 bucks.  Good stuff. Just go.

Passable food served by attractive waitresses who seem distracted. I think they're over-staffed to the point that none of the girls (yes, "girls" is appropriate in this case: Seeing young females in ridiculous outfits is the only excuse to come here) makes any real money. Lights are too bright, energy is too low.   If the attractiveness of the waitstaff is your major concern, try one of the Sam Fox joints, or Del Frisco's. Better food with your scenery in those places.

Nice late-night destination, and a far quieter and more peaceful alternative to Mabel's.   Good appetizer menu with ok prices. Comfortable surroundings. Cool clientele.   I'll be back

Get here before 8 on weekends, or learn to enjoy the waiting list.  Overall, very happy to have this fancy breakfast eatery in the 'hood. All ingredients were prime, from the coffee to the side of fruit and everything in between. The interior decor is flawlessly hip-retro, and the table service is more than adequate.  Since time immemorial, breakfast restaurants counted on making money on volume and turnover rather than margin. But now at the upper end of the breakfast market, it seems they are pushing more to increase margins, as in $9 for 3-ingredient omelette with a side of hashbrowns. The meats on the side (including very good sausage) are an extra $2.50-$3.50. So count on, like, $15 for an omelette, a side of bacon, and a cup of coffee. Throw in a tip and . . . well . . . did you say you were on an expense account? Was that what I heard?  You don't come here to save money, but it still counts as a good value.

They're directly across from giant office buildings from which large groups of lunchseekers emanate. Is "lunchseekers" a word? I guess it is now.  Anyway, our group of 10 was seated quickly, then not much happened. Then we got beverages. My friend got a glass of water all over his shirt. The server accidentally dropped it on him. The glass shattered on the floor. It was ok: accidents happen and it was a hot day anyway. The wet polo shirt provided a cooling effect.   So, we waited a while longer. Too long, really. Food started coming out from the kitchen. The servers didn't know who ordered what. It's ok. It happens. Really.  It was standard Chinese lunch fare. Nothing really good or bad. It's ok. It happens. Really.  Started to notice people at other tables waiting for food or drinks or checks. It's ok. It happens. Really.  They gave us the wrong check at the end. It's ok. It happens. Really.  We waited about 15 minutes for a revised check to appear. It's ok. It happens. Really.  Our lunch hour turned into a lunch hour and a half. It's ok. It happens. Really.  And to be honest, I told the hostess that my friend with the wet shirt shouldn't be asked to pay for his lunch, and she agreed he didn't. The manager might have been upset about this, but. . . It's ok. It happens. Really.

Hasn't happened to me in a while. I was almost delighted!  For years I avoided Starbucks because I just drink black coffee: Plain old black coffee. And for years Starbucks had the worst black coffee in the biz. It was burned-tasting, probably over-roasted in some effort to cut the sweetness of the tons of sugar most people want in their coffee confections. So when I'd go to Starbucks and they'd cheerily ask "what can I get started for you?" I'd just say "medium coffee, black" and usually they couldn't understand. Then I got attitude. I got sick of it. I stayed away in droves.  But then they came out with that Pikes Place© branded stuff (everything needs to have a brand. Intellectual capital and all that) and it was ok and they stopped giving me attitude when I'd order it. Maybe Starbucks could be a coffee destination for me once again.  So it was with some delight that my order at the drive-thru speaker was greeted with a pause and soft-voiced incredulity. When I rolled up to the window, $2.50 in hand, I beheld the almost-offended haughty visage of a tattooed coffee artisan, who handed me a cup almost without making eye contact. "Two-eleven" he said, flatly. I handed him the money and said "keep it", trying to smooth over the poor dear's rankled nerves. But an artist, once offended, can't be assuaged with a mere tuppence. He said nothing and retreated to his lair behind the window, obviously there to ponder the banality of the philistine he had just encountered.   And I was delighted. Because I can now safely go back to my previous prejudices regarding Starbucks. Mission Accomplished!

Hipsteriffic little offbeat beer/wine pub within walking distance (for me), and their happy hour runs until 8.   Wow.  The only downside: It's really small and is getting pretty popular.  Hop on your single-speed and head up there sometime.

Very happy with the responsiveness, promptness and most of all the quality of the work here. Talk about going above and beyond! I think my car looks better than new. The price is reasonable for a real detail job (forget "detailing" car washes offer in addition to their standard packages). Call J and he'll do it right.
