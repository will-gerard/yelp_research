Typically with this place you know you are going to receive an amazing meal. Unfortunately this time around was different. Something changed about this place. I used to come here when it opened up and have always gotten the same meal.  I always get a combo meal, teriyaki, jade red chicken quesadilla, and chicken friend rice. I have sworn by this meal to people as I think it's one of the best. My recent visit I was let down a lot.   I walk in, wrote down my usual and look at the cashier and she walks away. I thought she was doing the register because she had just taken a ladies order... Guess not. So I wait... Finally a lady take my order and before I could order she tried to upsell me on some new stuff, so I tried because hey it can't possibly be bad.   When I received my meal the teriyaki sauce was off it looks like a jello gravy consistency. It's usually a real teriyaki sauce and tastes delicious. I picked up my weapon of choice, my fork, and dive right in. I was shocked by the disgusting flavor and texture I received from the teriyaki chicken. In disbelief I let my friend try some and she was shocked at how gross it was too. So I put the teriyaki aside for the fly that kept flying around.   I then headed towards the jade red chicken quesadilla. It tasted normal and great but they definitely shorted me on the chicken. Thinking of it as a oh well mentality I headed towards the wings I ordered. Yes that's right they now have wings. When I opened the ranch I originally thought it was blue cheese, I was wrong.  It was homemade ranch that just tasted like sour cream mixed with a pickle.   The wings I half are was absolutely terrible. I am truly amazed at the route this place I used to love went. Hopefully they get it together because I miss it. There are other things different there like the nice gentlemen playing his guitar trying to hit the rights notes. I thought this was restaurant that was chill. Not a bar. Anyways, I hope this review helps beware anyone that thinks they will get decent food, with a very nice staff. I say that with the most sarcastic voice in my head.

I needed a haircut to look like a person again. I Went  into this sports clips and was greeted with a genuine smile and hello. Not too many place do that anymore. I got the full treatment and wasn't disappointed one bit. Before I came in, I read reviews and everyone complains about how much it is. I don't see why... You pay for quality and the experience. If you want to be treated like a person and not another number, DEFINITELY come here! It's really nice finally finding a place that actually cares. Ohhh and they have this shampoo that makes your head feel tingly. Pick up some of that too. I will be back for more!

I have been looking for a place that serves amazing wings with some style. This placed does that for me. From the koolaid fountain to the cutout metal chicken on the wall, this place is the shit. Their wings are definitely the best wings I have ever had in AZ. Other places are super greasy, and make me poop right after. But this place has defied the odds with my bowel issue and love of wings.  I will definitely be back and become a loyal customer. I recommend this place to everyone.
