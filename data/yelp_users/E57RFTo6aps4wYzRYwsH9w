Excellent pizza, regardless of the toppings. Wings are good, with a variety of sauces to choose from.

Very efficient operation. The nice young lady pulled up the paint I needed on her tablet, I paid and a few minutes later I was out of there with my paint. Very impressed with their quick and courtesy service.

Both visits here were not the best. It's the service that seems to be lacking. Overall, it takes a long time for the wait staff to get your drink order, then food order. Food takes way too much time to arrive after ordering (the last time I went it wasn't crowded, so the kitchen wasn't being slammed with orders) and doesn't arrive at the same time if you're in a group.  The food is decent, but certainly not great.   If they can revamp their wait staff operation this place certainly could be great.

Food is pure fat and yumminess. One plate is enough to feed three people. We had more leftovers than we knew what to do with. Definitely need to fast for a week before coming here, but well worth it.

What can I say? It's sushi and I love it. The Senorita roll is one of my favorites! Place isn't big and gets packed pretty quickly. You can't go wrong with any of their sushi selections there.

Got my haircut here for the first time here, and it was great. Donald cut my hair and he was great. We got along as if we known each other for years and he cut my hair exactly the style I wanted.

I lived in Phoenix for years, but never ate at Houston's until my friend Amie came from Wisconsin. We had breakfast there, and the food was great. We ate at the bar and the service was good. Mimosa was potent as I was tipsy after only the first drink. The price is a little high, but that's what you pay for the high end type of place it comes across as.

I thought Churn and Cold Stone were good,this place blows them out of the water. The ice cream is so good I can't even describe the experience. From the first bite you know you're having a top notch made dessert. Its a little odd going to a sit down place for dessert, but what the heck, it's so worth it.

Haven't been here for a few years as only two restaurants exist in Phoenix, both no where near I live. Food is still good, I don't understand why the chain has struggled. Lemon drop martinis were way too easy to suck down.

I love wine bars, but this place really wasn't my scene. But the bartender was great, offered personalized service. Not sure if I would return here, but it's not because of the wine or lack of service. This place knows how to run an operation.

There were five of us who came for dinner. We were told it was a thirty minute wait for a table, so we decided to wait in the bar area. There were three bartenders working and none of them acknowledged us when we sat at the bar. Fifteen minutes passed and none of them took our drink order. It wasn't until I asked loudly if we could order a drink did a bartender serve us.  A couple minutes after receiving our drinks the hostess came and told us a table was ready and to close out our tab at the bar. We waited a couple minutes for our bar bill, and got nothing. I asked loudly for our bill and all three bartenders ignore me. Me and the group went to the table. If the bar wanted our money they could come to us. Sure enough five minutes later a bartender ran over with our tab. We have a zero dollar tip for the awful bar service.  Our waiter on the other hand was phenomenal. He provided us first class service and was great.  My recommendation for this restaurant: either seriously retrain your bar staff or fire them and start anew. None of them should be in the food service industry they way they currently act.

This wine bar has unique and flavorful dishes to try. I've been here several times and have been more than satisfied with my selections each time. The staff is consistently friendly and service is efficient, even on their busy nights.  Besides wine they have a good selections of mixed drinks to try as well.

The name is misleading as they offer a variety of desserts. I've come here twice for their cupcakes, and they are good, no matter what flavor you get. The cupcakes are apparently gluten free, which means nothing to me as to me the dessert tastes like you're eating sugar and fat, which is good!

I must say this is the best sushi I've had in Phoenix...period. The spicy tuna roll had so much flavor to it, and the squid salad was superb. The place is small but has a quaint atmosphere. The place doesn't serve alcohol, but it is a BYOB.

Place is always good. I had the artichoke heart appetizer and it was quite tasty. Wine is expensive, as is the food, if you don't go during happy hour. But it's one of my preferred places to go to and people watch as I work on my books. Kelly was a great server, very attentive to providing quality wait service. This place consistently provides good food and service.

Great desserts. Can't believe I didn't know about this place all these years. It's recessed back in the strip mall it's located in, but somehow they are thriving. The salted caramel was the best.

This place is a poster child of how not to run a hospitality business. The front desk clerk (don't know if he was the owner or not) was rude and curt with me. He made it a point to tell me when check out was the next morning, as if I was not welcomed. I did not understand why he was so rude, but I wasn't going to put up with it. I told him if he wanted to act in such a manner I would take my hard earn money elsewhere. I won't be back there under any reason.  Since I wound up not staying I cannot attest to the property's standards and layout.

Nothing beats their $5.00 Monday night burger. That's the only time I come here as it's too good of a deal to pass up. The service is always good and the staff consistently friendly. The only thing to drive up the meal prices are the drinks, which are spending. But stick to water or ice tea and you get good, and a lot of food, for cheap.

I'm simply amazed how this place can stay in business offering selections at such low prices. And the quality of the food doesn't reflect the prices either. I've had a variety of items of the menu and it's all equally as good.   I'm competing with my friend Michael for the title of Duke here, that's how much I love this place.

The food at this chain has always been consistently good. Our server in downtown (where we spent New Year's) was new, but that did not impact our service at all. She was prompt and attentive to our needs.

Very disappointing overall, which is a shame because the food was good. But the wait service was way below subpar. Between waiting 10 minutes to be seated and another 20 just to get our food order in, will not return here. We wound up having to go to the bar to get our drink order. And the amazing part was the place wasn't even packed. The restaurant was half empty. It was clear they were severely understaffed. In this day and age of instant reviews, first impressions are critically important. This place failed to have even basic customer service in place and does not warrant a return visit, especially given the higher end prices they charge.

This used to be a drive up coffee shop. Now the serve great food and the best damn lemon drop martinis that they serve in huge glasses. Staff is very friendly. Wish I wasn't moving to Scottsdale, will probably not make it back here.

How disappointing my last visit here, and it was entirely attributed to the staff. These two girls (new since my last visit there) work there who have no concept of waiting on people, let alone running a business. They seemed more interested in chatting with their friends hanging out there then servicing customers. I sat there for ten minutes and neither of them bothered to even acknowledge me. What a shame that the good food and drink and nice ambience of the place has been ruined by an incompetent staff. It was like the place has been taken over by high schoolers. Too many other wine bars are out there that provide consistent customer service for me to bother returning to this place ever again.

The food was generally awful. The sweet potato fries were the only good thing I ate. The chicken sandwich I ate was very dry, and service was not the best. What should have tipped me off was all the other restaurants around were filled and had 20 to 40 minute waits, but Coal Burger wasn't even half-full. Won't return to this place ever. They should cut there loses and close their doors and let another business have a shot here in the Scottsdale Quarters.

Went there for the first time. I shared a crab cake sandwich, which was ok, and a Reuben sandwich, which was very good. Also shared a side of okra and mac and cheese, which I couldn't get enough of. The atmosphere is very chicago-like, and our waitress was a doll

Wonderful sushi, top notch. The octopus came with a sweet sauce that complimented the octopus very well. Service was prompt, the server pleasant. Didn't have any alcoholic drinks, so can't attest to the bartender's skills. Would recommend this place to anyone.

Wow! What an amazing place. The food was absolutely to die for. I had the escargot, and my friend had a brie and truffle oil soup that was absolutely wonderful. Even their Caesar salad was the best I ever had.  The service was great. I ordered a lemon drop. The waitress realized the glass was too small and sent it back to the bartender to put (and add more) in a larger glass. I didn't even have to ask.  This place is far above what Bomberos was, and I liked Bomberos. I highly recommend this place to anyone and plan on becoming a regular customer here.

This was the first time I used a housekeeping service. Both the ladies did a wonderful job deep cleaning my townhouse. They spent almost two hours cleaning. I did a walk through and was not disappointed. The service followed through in their communication and met all my expectations.

What now stands as Diablos is a complete departure from the dive bars that used to inhabit the building.  Diablos can be best described as upscale and sophisticated, something truly lacking in the gay hangouts here in Phoenix (Stacy's and Kobalt are nice bars, but don't portray themselves at the same level as Diablos). The decor is tastefully done with an high end ambiance to it.  I visited the establishment twice before writing this review and am pleased to say their was consistency in the demeanor of the staff and my interaction with them.  My first visit was during their monthly artist exhibition, which I find noteworthy they are using their venue to showcase local artists. Good for them. Every employee I spoke with was nice, respectful, and grateful for coming to support both the artist and their new business. After the exhibition, one of the employees took the time to explain some of the things they are working to bringing to Diablos. Again, the interaction was friendly and engaging.  My second visit was during a weekend afternoon with a friend and the place was not as crowded as the artist event. But yet again, both the bartender and wait staff greeted us. My friend had a diet coke and the wait staff was diligent in ensuring he had a full glass at the table before his other glass went empty. It's that type of attention to detail to customer service that will set this place apart from the other venues.  I can see myself going to Diablos on a regular basis to meet with friends or bring my laptop and do some work over a nice drink.  It's refreshing that such an establishment has finally come to the gay community here in Phoenix. I wish nothing but success for Los Diablos.

What keeps bringing me back here is the tapas during happy hour. You can load up on all the tapas you want for $1 or $2 for each helping. You can easily fill up on just the tapas without ordering a full meal.  I recommend the dolmades and shrimp, they are the best. Throw in a glass of their One Hope wine and you have the makings of a great and cheap meal.  Finally, the staff has been consistently friendly and prompt in their service.

I love the concept they have here, bringing hot stones to place the steak or meat you order to cook. Very ingenious idea that they've executed well.  The only downside to the place is the decor is dated and it does attract a most geriatric crowd. But if you can get past those things you won't be disappointed in the food.

My friend and I ate here late one night and we ate out in the patio. The dinner and desert was very good. We had a hard time figuring out what to order. I did the flatbread and mushrooms and my friend had a pork chop, which was huge. In the end we split a tart desert that I could have eaten several times, it was that good.  Service was a little slow. I did notice the table next to us received their food before we did, despite the couple arriving after we did. But the waitress was nice and definitely did her best. I think a little more experience will improve her efficiency.   Looking forward to coming back here again.
