Central Car Care is the most honest,  trustworthy, and reliable auto repair shop I've come across in a long  time.  I found them on Yelp and I'm really glad I decided to take my car there.

I've been going to Sarah at Sachi salon since moving to Phoenix earlier this year.  I have extremely difficult hair that had been relaxed using the Japanese relaxer process for over 7 years.  Sarah has helped revive my hair and bring it back to health.   She truly knows how to work with curly hair and her blow outs are absolutely amazing.   Give Sarah a try...  I promise you won't be disappointed!!

My dog has had chronic ear infections for over 10 years which is very common for her breed (Cocker Spaniel mix).  Despite trying many different oral and topical medications, I was unable to find a vet that was able to cure her until I met Dr. Dawson.  Dr. Dawson put her on several medications and also put her on a hyper-allergenic dog food to test her for allergies.  Within 2 weeks, my dog was cured!  She has more energy than she has in years and no longer scratches her ears constantly.  It's as though I have a new dog.    I couldn't be happier to have found Dr. Dawson!

Every time I purchase a groupon from Danny's Car Wash there seems to be a technical glitch.  This time I came in with one of the receipts/vouchers generated by Danny's when I turned in my groupon certificate.  They said the car wash had already been used.  Really?  How could i have used it multiple times if you generate the ticket from your register?  To top it off, I always have to go back through and have them vaccuum the car a second time and touch up spots they miss when wiping down the interior of the car. I'm not talking about hidden spots!  I'm talking about lifting the floor mats and getting ALL of the dirt under them.  Or really cleaning the interior coffee mug holders that have obvious coffee cup stains.  I am on the hunt for a new car wash in North Scottsdale.

On 10/26/13, my friend Stacey took her car to Danny's for a car wash only to have her $150 ipod stolen right out of her car by one of Danny's workers.  She noticed the ipod was missing immediately upon entering her car and notified the manager and filed a police report.  Needless to say, Danny's has not rectified the situation.  If that's not reason enough to boycott Danny's, I don't know what is.

I typically only write reviews when I have a really good experience somewhere or really bad....  Ganem Jewelers has quite possibly the worst customer service!  I found a ring that I liked in their store and inquired about having a similar ring custom made with a few modifications.  John Eckert told me he would follow up with the manufacturer as well as Ganem's designer and get back to me with pricing info etc.  Not only did he neglect to call me back, I called him 4 times over a 2 week period and he never even returned my phone calls.  With this kind of customer service, they are going to have a hard time staying in business.  Needless to say, I took my business elsewhere.

I checked the price at several repair shops before selecting Brakes Plus to have the brakes on my BMW 3 series replaced.  Chris works the front desk and was extremely knowledgeable and thorough.  He was honest about the work that needed to be done and worked with me on price. The shop did a great job and had all the work completed in under an hour.  If you need to have your brakes replaced, I would highly recommend this location of Brakes Plus!

Such a disappointing experience.  The food was bland, presentation was terrible and the service was poor.  I ordered the vegie burger which turned out to be a  mushy patty that wasn't fully cooked or formed.  The quinoa side salad that came with the dish was small and flavorless.  They only have one white wine and one red wine selection.  My two other vegie friends were equally disappointed.  Don't waste your money on this place.

Spectrum Dermatology seems to be focusing on the aesthetic line of their business rather than their core business of dermatology.  I'm sure this is a more profitable area for them.  Rather than address several of my questions, Dr Rubenzik suggested I talk to their aesthetician.  Dr. Rubenzik even pushed several products rather than giving me a prescription for a product I could fill at the pharmacy for a lower copay.    Needless to say, I don't plan to go back to Spectrum Dermatology again.

While shopping for a birthday gift earlier this month, I discovered House of Diamonds after a good friend referred me here.  Boy am I glad I discovered this gem!!!  The owner, Brent Taubman helped me create a unique right hand ring and I couldn't be more thrilled.  Prices are reasonable and they will work with your budget.  I can assure you this isn't the last piece of jewelry I will purchase from House of Diamonds!

I was excited to discover that Matt's Big Breakfast had opened at Sky Harbor but it was quite possibly the worst dining experience I've had at an airport in quite some time.  I waited for nearly 15 minutes for a bowl of oatmeal and a coffee. After asking several times when my breakfast would be ready, and being told "Just a couple more minutes," I realized that I was going to leave the restaurant without my breakfast.  I requested a refund, however, the manager couldn't figure out how to work the register to handle my refund so I left without my receiving my breakfast or refund.  The manager kept suggesting that I be patient while waiting for my breakfast and again when I requested my refund.  Unfortunately I had a plane to catch and didn't have the luxury of waiting over 15 minutes for breakfast or to get my money back.    In case they haven't realized it yet - The airport is not the place to ask patrons to be patient!  Don't waste your time or money at this establishment.

Spa 810 is the former Body Solutions Laser & Skin location on Hayden Rd and Thompson Peak.    I recently purchased a package of chemical peels. I had no issues with the 1st TCA peel and then went back two months later for my 2nd peel.  The peel was performed by an aesthetician named Carley.   She applied too many layers of the chemical and literally burned my face and left me with severe hyperpigmentation on my cheeks, chin and jaw line.  In addition, she did such a poor job applying the product that I have lines that almost look like streaks across my cheeks where Carely neglected to put any product.  I almost wonder if she was half asleep while preforming the chemical peel.      I have gone back to Spa 810 for seven LED treatments to promote healing of the skin.  The aestheticians felt that my skin had heeled enough and began performing brightening facials - essentially a mini-facial for 20 to 30 minutes with a few products designed to help fade the pigmentation.  The spa has been monitoring my progress taking pictures of my face and sharing them with the spa's owner.      The spa has provided me with some products as well as these treatments at no cost.  The spa director,  Kristin, received approval from the spa owner to refund my money.  However, I was not aware that when they refunded my money last week they would no longer continue working with me to rectify the situation.  The problem Is that my face is only 50% better.    I sought a second opinion from a dermatologist and have also invested in several products on my own.  The refund I received from the spa doesn't even come close to covering the cost of things I have paid for out of pocket or the time I have spent - not to mention the pain and suffering.    I signed a waiver when I agreed to have the spa perform the peel, otherwise, I would have sought legal counsel.  Based on how extreme this situation was, I may still seek legal advice.    It seems that Kaley and Kristy are the only aestheticians that really care.  They have both been great at working with me and seem to genuinely be concerned about the situation.  Carley (the aesthetician who applied the peel) has never apologized for what she did to my face and I am sure she is embarrassed by what happened.  While my case might be extreme, I urge you to be wary before stepping foot in this spa.
