To be completely honest the only reason I come here is because it's only $20 for a gel/shellac manicure where other places are $35-40.   They do a good job on waxing, not the best ever however better than most places in this part of town that I've tried.   Prices are the best, service isn't bad, and that's basically it!

Clean theater, never long wait, and love the VIP tickets you can buy in a bunch. Only complaint is the popcorn seems not as fresh at times, or last check in there on Monday no salt on popcorn. You do have all the condiments and seasonings handy, so that is a plus. Perhaps have the butter station out as some theaters do. Love the loyalty cups!  I do like that you hire people with disabilities!! (Noticed that on my last two visits.) Good work Harkins!!

Horrible service and the worst part the sushi was below mediocre. Yen or Wasabi are much better options. (worth the wait)  When we received our appetizer we had to ask for plates. Then the worst part the runner brings our sushi out and no sign of the waitress for thirty minutes. Her name: Hannah.  I look around for her or someone, she is nowhere to be seen. I get up and go to the sushi bar and get my own dishes. Otherwise we'd be eating sushi with no wasabi,  ginger, or soy sauce.   I ask to speak to the manger and he is pretending to write something down like he was taking notes and asked if we wanted an appetizer. Um no sir we only saw the waitress after we were done eating, why would we want an appetizer or drink when we are leaving.   He says well next time you come in tell me and we'll do something for you.   Next time I come in? That would be a never ever!   Tacky place. If you're a early twenty something's westsider who doesn't care for sushi then this is your place.

Impressed with this strip mall alley dive bar. I love the Hoot Owl! Best part they have extremely clean restrooms for men and woman. Great service and great deals!

This is by far not only the best Thai Rama, but the best Thai place in the valley. Always have great service, they are consistent, and I've tried probably at least 15 different thai places.   The spicy noodles or the drunken noodles are to drool about!   Thankfully it isn't too close to home for me or I'd eat it several times a week.   Hard to find consistently great authentic food!  Phoenix FAV!

I am only reviewing the sushi. We waited more than thirty minutes for food. They were somewhat busy however we were hardly acknowledged. The rice on the sushi was too sticky and the rolls were warm. It was a bit humid from the Korean BBQ grills. I won't be back.

This place is easy to sign up for and hard to give up because all the other stuff it has, not just tanning. But the tanning is great!  The red light therapy is definitely my favorite. Read all the pros of using red light online. Makes you feel refreshed and rejuvenated just getting out of the bed.   The hydra bed definitely helps keep your skin from being dry and the slimcapsule I've only tried once and love.   The water pressure massage bed is pretty great too, I can get stuck in that place for hours.  I've only done the spray tan at the North Scottsdale location on Bell as it has the HD bed and I've had amazing results, no orange color, doesn't fade bad or streak.   Only complaint as everyone here is the costumer service, the Scottsdale location and on 75th ave is much better. I'm not a fan of the "I think I'm better than you" or I lack customer service and people skills so I come across snotty attitudes.  No you do not have to buy their products to use their stuff I buy almost all my products NOT from them. Unless they have a 60% off sale, who could resist that.   Some of the girls in there are growing on me or I just learned to ignore them and use my membership for the services and use them as a computer check in check out system.   I will gladly change the review on the customer service if it gets better however I will still use this for the time being

This place is delicious! You get seated right away and you can place your order right away as well. Your food will come out quickly and consistently taste the same, yummy!  The service is where it's lacking, if they just left a pitcher of water at every table they'd bed set. They do not come often and if they do its because you waived them down. Personally, I think it has to do with the culture and not bothering/harassing people while eating.   Clean restaurant and bathrooms another plus!

Great massage chairs and very friendly staff! My mom told me about the place and this is my second time back.   Plus free wifi while you are getting a pedicure!

I will never be back. I was rushed to order when at about 12:30 only three people were at the restaurant. Then when I ordered the lunch special they forgot to bring my soup. Whoever said the hot and sour soup was terrible was dead on. The meat doesn't even taste good in it.   The orange chicken tasted like ketchup or vinegar. The fried rice was not good.   The service was rushed and unfriendly. I can go to a place and eat even if the service isn't good.  The food was terrible. The only decent thing I ate was the egg roll and wonton. Not sure if it was just the cook, but even the staff seemed as though they were arguing.   And to top it off my fortune cookie had no fortune when opened. It seemed as bough it was the icing on the cake. When all and all I am mostly disappointed in my lunch choice.

My mom was stuck on the side of the road, other tire places were closed, Costco was $100 more, and this place was right off of the exit. The customer service was great and they got me in and out on Mother's Day! I recommend this place to anyone. My sister even said, "Nicest guys ever!" And she is hard to please especially when in the local weather is 97 today.   Thanks for your great service!!

Very helpful, free diagnostic check, open late, and being a girl pays because you can ask for help without having to worry about not knowing how to do it yourself.  I felt the guy who helped me could have been more friendly (almost like he was scared of me), but the job was done.   Close to home and has warranty on batteries and great exchange policy.

Clean restaurant, clean restrooms, staff is always very friendly, and for as busy as they are they do an excellent job.   Because of the area, demographics, and now the cheap $25 special they have you do hear crying babies and other loud noise that previous I didn't see as much in Olive Garden.   Toscana (sp?) soup is amazing, I add red onions from salad and if any left the banana peppers. Mussels are small, but most places are.. All in all it's white Italian food as long as that is what you are expecting you won't be disappointed.

Not the best in town, but we will definitely be going often to the happy hour as it is very close.   The salmon was delicious melted on my tongue. The Philly roll was probably one of the best I've had at any of these west side sushi places, even better than Yen. Yen has asparagus in it which makes it weird. They have cucumber AND avocado. Any Philly roll fans would say that's a little piece of heaven.   Very clean inside and staff is attentive
