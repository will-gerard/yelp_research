you could receive better customer service at a Walmart!!!!!  That is being very generous. At first I was really impressed with their selection and very eager to buy quite a few things. I then I proceeded to ask if I could try on a wig (you don't know what it looks like unless you try it) the first sales associate seemed like she was going to let me then this extremely grumpy and very unpersonable lady approached us and said we don't have time for that get back to work...I turned around to see if there was people behind me, no one who looked like they needed help. I was assuming she was the owner, she did not greet me nor did she ask if she could help me with something. All she had was an extremely unfriendly and rude personality. Oh did i mention she wasnt even helping customers she was just bitching the whole time. I would really hope she doesn't treat all the customers like that

If you want friendly, personable and nice people and have the front desk actually help you with your problems I'd suggest you don't ever bother going to this location. The lady was beyond rude to me and other patients and didn't even help me. I ended up leaving.

Signed an agreed contract for work to be done. Come to pick it up work was not done and he said there was no contract that was signed. Out of everything that needed to be done nothing got fixed, we basically got charged for him taking apart the vehicle. We also bought our parts from a different 3rd party and after the work was done he did not even use the parts that we wanted fixed and argued with us that he didn't have to return the parts to us even though we bought them and brought them in to him to use for our truck. Horrible shop I recommend you stay far away

If I could have given no stars that would have been my first choice. A friend of mine went to this location with a picture of the type of color she wanted,  the cut itself was just supposed to a trim. She is naturally a very dark brunette and wanted to go very lighter. They had to strip the color and then apply it. After applying it, it came out extremely the wrong color. They then had to strip it again multiple times and attempted to correct it to the color needed. She had multiple stylists trying to fix it. She was their for a total of 5 hours and when she left it still wasn't the right color. She felt ugly and horrible about herself. On top of that everyone there severely harassed her and they made her pay not only for the original plan but for all of their time and product they used while trying to fix what no one could get right. Also when asking the front clerk about the price,  she was told she didn't know what all the extra charges were because she wasn't involved. So unless you want to be charged a lot of extra money for these people to fry your hair, give you the wrong color and harass you the whole time I would STRONGLY suggest that you DO NOT GO HERE!

We got tacos and the taco salad. All of it was extremely good! The taste was all there, you can tell they smoke all the meat in house which makes it even better. Also everyone was super nice. Clean restaurant and nice set up. Overall very good experience!
