"Sales person" spent so long trying to upsell the poor woman in front of me, I literally backed out of getting my truck washed here...

If you need a hat, shop here first! Stopped in this morning after shopping several other places across the southwest... None had my size or even offered to help me find exactly what I was looking for. Not only did this shop have just about every style and color of hats, they also had custom sizing available! This is a big deal with hats when you have a noggin my size. The store owner not only searched through his entire inventory to find me the exact style I was looking for, but resized (steam treated and stretched) the hat until it was a perfect fit. Be sure you ask the owner, Rich, if you have any questions or can't find what you are looking for... Chances are he can help you become a very happy customer, too!

Customer Service is great! Could't find an item I was looking for by the time I got ready to check out... Mentioned it to an employee who immediately jumped on the phone and had the item BROUGHT TO ME! :) Thanks, Ikea employees!!

I just went to Safeway and left my iPad behind (it had my shopping list on it). I was all the way home when i realized it. I am happy to say when I got back to the store, it had already been found, turned in and locked up in the manager's office :) "Thank you" to the person who found it and turned it in and the staff for stowing it away. Best of all possible outcomes! Yes Karma, you certainly do rock ;)

Need a divey Irish pub with good grub? Done! Don't let the four stars fool ya, this place isn't fancy or a gastro-pub catering to hipsters... This is a dark, loyal locals bar with everything you'd expect in an Irish pub... Friendly service, traditional dishes (and the American standards too) wooden bar, tables and chairs, trivia, live music and DAY DRINKERS. The only thing it has going against it is its location (Metro Center)... But after an 8oz portion of delicious Fish n Chips (all you can eat on Fridays) Jameson and a Guinness, you wont care about that anymore... See ya next Friday :)

The Mackerel was fresh.  That's it. My only real compliment.  Mackerel is actually a tricky one. It can be dry, over marinated, oily, or even somewhat shredded if it's not exactly prepared. But for a less inexpensive choice, it's been one of my favorites used to determine an establishment's ability to serve quality sushi. This was up there with some of the better locations... until... the sushi chef put a mess of what I thought was minced garlic on top of each piece. Unfortunately for both of us, it was not garlic. It was ginger.  Why on earth would you obliterate the wonderfully marinated flavor of Mackerel with what I equate to Mother Nature's Lemon Pledge? (I HATE ginger). Fortunately, my server switched out my frozen beer with a less frigid relative and I was able to wash out the remnants of the furniture polish condiment before too much damage had been done.   Moving on to the Tabiko.   Again, this was fresh, but it was prepared with the finesse of a Taco Bell cashier... smashed and poorly wrapped and then thrown onto a plate. Most locations will ask if you'd like the quail egg atop the tabiko... but here, each egg will run you an extra charge. The only bright spot was that the chef offered me a ramekin of Ponzu sauce that was a nice touch over the standard soy sauce, low sodium or otherwise.   Finally, the Olive You roll. This was a "unique" choice as it contained ingredients I had not yet seen on a sushi menu, including an olive tapenade, sun dried tomatoes, cream cheese, and toasted garlic. It was the toasted garlic that sold me as I actually HAD that on a fantastic Albacore Tuna item at Sushi Creek in Queen Creek. Unfortunately, the chef here either forgot the garlic, or did not put enough of it in to be distinguished from the briny olives. I only ate 3 of the 8 pieces.   I know, I know. "First review I've seen from this guy and he blasts a local place to pieces." Well... I can only say, try it for yourself. I hope I'm the exception to the rest of the crowd as I would love to see East Mesa develop into a culinary destination. Unfortunately, the hype, the loud music, the lack of ambience, and the poor customer service completely undermine what was only mediocre sushi to begin with.   If the owners or management read this, I would only suggest that this be seen as positive criticism. The staff needs direction and training... the food quality (freshness) is there, it just needs refining and possibly a little trimming... more is not better. Ask your customers to fill out those little surveys... find out what you can improve on to fill the place on a Friday night while still serving a quality product and giving your customers an experience rather than just some rice and fish.  * Clean up your menu, too many items and its not presented to the customer in a neat manner. Mine literally fell apart and had food remnants from previous guests.  * Train the sushi chefs and servers the finer points of customer service. Your establishment exudes luxury, but the servers think they are working at Oregano's. Far too casual and not very knowledgeable about the products or even their surroundings.  * The high ceilings draw the customer's eye upwards... unfortunately, there is nothing up there but the air vents. Paint them black so they are no longer the draw... hang some tapestries or photos on fabric. This will provide some desperately needed art while also assisting in reducing the din of the ambient chatter echoed off the concrete floors.   * Your clientele is NOT the Scottsdale crowd. These are older adults with some money, taste, and expectations. Play on that. Adjust the music to a tolerable level while still playing modern artists. Unusual tracks, acoustic versions of popular hits and live music will also bring in a niche unsatisfied in the East Valley. The younger crowd likes this for dates too... and keeps them from doing sake bombers.   * Hang some artwork on those big, tall, green walls. This place is screaming for some big black and whites of the beautiful Superstitions. What better way to acknowledge the area?! OH, and lose the piece of @%*(& hanging in the Men's room. That wouldn't have even worked in the 80's. BLECH!  I wish the proprietors luck... but in the mean time, I'll be at Sakana or Sushi Creek. They may not have the glitz and glam, but the food is fantastic, the service is stellar and appropriate to their approach and decor, and I can be sure of quality over quantity every time.

Came here a while ago just to get a quick wash before a road trip to Vegas... And as it had been a while, and my truck sees a lot of miles for work, I decided to get their best wash package... Unfortunately, that just means the attendant will then try to sell you EVERYTHING else on their list of add-on's ranging from floor mat shampoo, to carnuba hand wax... He finally suckered me in with two Ultimate Washes and an interior detailing (one of the washes and the interior to be redeemed at a later date). So here I am trying to redeem that upsell, and the attendant AGAIN tries to talk me into another set of upgrades! I politely said no thanks, as I'd just like to get what I've already paid for and be on my way... But no... I'm now this guy's project and he starts giving my truck the once over, pointing out every little blemish or "spider webbing" in the paint... dude, just wash the car! "Well, I'll knock ten dollars off"... No, just want what I've already paid for... "well, what about the interior seats... You only paid to have the doors and dash done..." Just do what I've paid for... A blank stare back from him like I'm some cheap bastard because he couldn't sell me anything else beyond the previous upsells! After he finally figured out I wasn't biting, he told me they'd have it ready in about an hour and a half... The cashier inside even took my number to call me when it was done... But two hours later, no call. I had my friend drive me back after we finished breakfast and my truck was in the "finished" lot, but I could still see areas that weren't wiped well and water spotted... Even a couple cat prints were on the hood! I decided I didn't want to deal with him telling me "Well those would have come out with the hand wax", so I came home and wiped off every  print and water mark easily enough myself... Needless to say, I won't be going back again... Your poor customer service and quality assurance have cost you a customer, and gained you another bad review.

Just moved into a new place and needed a dog door installed. After waiting weeks for the landlord's service crew to "get right on that", I finally gave up on them and called Mike at Copper State. Not only was he able to fit the job in on the SAME day, he took a few extra minutes out of his way to fix some faulty blinds too! Couldn't be happier with his work or service. Will definitely call him first next time. Highly recommended!

I found this place in Yelp, so I at least started with some optimism ;) I wasn't disappointed. Great portions and plenty of variety. Got egg rolls, mu shu pork, house low mein,  Mongolian beef, rice and 4 fortune cookies, soy sauce, and hot mustard for about $30 plus tip. Plenty of leftovers after stuffing myself ;)  Everything tasted as expected, though the egg rolls and Mongolian beef were better than most... Not crazy great, but really good for take out/delivery. Now if they only made Chinese turkey for Christmas!!

This is my favorite neighborhood spot, hands down. The bar staff is ALWAYS friendly, the patrons are always friendly, and the food is always  really good! To be fair, they have a limited menu, but that's what makes them good at it... The attention to the little things exceed what you might find elsewhere... And when you do find a flaw, you really are happy to overlook it because they excel where others don't even try. They make you feel welcome and as if you're at a friend's place, rather than just a turn and burn restaurant. They actually love working there and you can tell... Lots of regulars in the place, and yes... They will get to know you, and your drink order pretty quickly. Today, I tried the Matador off their New Brunch Menu, which isn't posted on their web sight yet, but I'll post from a pic on their Facebook page ("like" them to get some great heads-ups on specials, etc.) and it was great! A friend kept eating bites off my plate too, but I really couldn't complain as it was THAT good, and there was definitely enough to share. Other meals I've had and enjoyed include the ribs, the corn dog poppers, the Fish sandwich, the Porkwich, and the loaded chips... All pretty unique in their own way and more than satisfying. I also love that I can go here for their mini pitcher of Odell IPA for 5 bucks, or just 7.50 after happy hour, where some places charge that much for just one beer. They also have a get set of house cocktails that are all made with fresh juices, herbs, purées, etc. The Pimms pitcher is an excellent alternative to a Bloody Mary... For which they also have lots of great fresh ingredients! Not sure what to eat or drink? Sit at the bar and anyone of their staff will be more than happy to go through what they have as well as take the time to get to know your likes/dislikes so they can make educated suggestions for you from what they have to offer.   The crowd at brunch was a great mix of young adults, small families, professionals, seniors and hungover hipsters... All of whom seemed to enjoy the people watching complexity of it all. And like I said, everyone feels very welcome and at home here. The restaurant doors open fully to join their patio to the bar on one side giving a great open feel even while sitting inside. Though, if you arrive after dark, you are likely going to be on a wait for a table or seat at the bar as it's a popular watering hole for the night life as well. Like many other Central Phoenix restaurants it has complimentary valet during busy hours so bring some cash for the attendants who are also just as friendly and will save you from having to walk blocks from other public parking. Locals will also love that it's definitely  bicycle friendly and has often been popular with biking for beers enthusiasts... And light rail pub crawls! :)   Check it out for yourself... Sit out by the 70's retro fireplace, the bar, or a high back leather booth with a friend or two, or just go to make new ones. Coco, Matty, Australian Rob, James, and Claire are some of my favorites to recommend to friends there... Oh, and if yore a tequila fan, try the Del Maguey Chichicapa Mescal, served neat (no lime, salt, or ice)... But SIP IT SLOWLY! It's like the best scotch and tequila got together in a night of bliss and created an awesome little bastard ;)   Cheers!

I love this place... I do. Anyone that knows me knows this is my "go to" joint. They are just that cool. But, just like you... They make mistakes... They are imperfect... They have flaws... They are human. But what I LOVE is that they OWN 'em. They'll swallow any pride, throw out the apology and fully accept responsibility when they blow it. Its not often, but hey... Shit happens.   Tonight it happened... and unfortunately, the customer that had his to-go order mistakenly given to another customer was understandably bummed he'd have to wait a few more minutes while his order was re-made.  In true awesome fashion, management was there to apologize, throw out some comps, and let the customer know that this was not their standard... "We are better than this" was his words. But unfortunately, this customer still had an attitude, and couldn't be kind to another person... one who was apologizing, one who took responsibility and one who tried to make it right.... Of course he took the comp and shook the man's hand... But what would it have cost him just to be kind?! Say "thank you", and just be decent??   Try it... Its soooo much more fun than being a dick.

I'm happy to  add one more star back to Molly Maid as the A-Team that I requested came by last week and they did an excellent job! Fortunately I will now have the same team each visit. Sorry to say though that I never heard from Molly Maid about the email I sent...

Wow! So glad I came in! Best haircut I could ask for. Came in all windswept and "come-overed" and left lookin' sharp! Matthew runs a tight ship too! A huge collection of photos and memorabilia adorn every surface in the comfy space making it feel very eclectic and cool... A place you don't mind waiting in line for your turn. Thanks, Matthew! Will definitely be back.

Called at 3:45 to see if there was a wait to get my cracked iPhone 5 screen replaced... No wait! Got there 10 minutes later and my phone was fixed ten minutes after that! Service was incredibly fast and this review can be written now without little sharp shards of glass cutting me to ribbons! :) MUCH less $ than going to Apple for the exact same parts and repair work. HIGHLY recommended... Check in on Yelp and get 10% off!

Ok people... Take a breath and reign in your inner bitch. This is the FIRST couple days of what will be a jewel of the neighborhood. Just like any new neighbor having guests over for the first time, your job as a guest is to welcome them first... Hold back on your criticism as if they owe you something because they we're blessed by your company. First impressions? Yes, the 4$ valet is not in line with the neighborhood norms. Adjust. Yea, live music! Live music by the front door?! Maybe not... Also, put up some artwork or other stuff to breakup the bare wall space. Ok... That's it. Nothing else to crab about cuz I was here two days in a row and I'm ready to go back tonight. The food was GREAT. Good portions, better than I make at home, and less than it would cost to make/burn myself. Great beers too! The one I disliked most is still delicious! How often can you say that?! Plus, I enjoy that it's not "service" so much as a bunch of people who like to cook and serve food and beer, hanging out with their neighbors. Like contributing to a pot luck with cash instead of potato salad. Don't get lost in the expectations of what you are buying with your dollar. Come, sit, eat, drink, listen, meet, share, taste, smell, speak, thank and ENJOY your neighbors and your neighborhood! ;) You can thank me later... Cheers!

Only going 4 stars 'cuz no self respecting BBQ joint would want a 5 star rating...   Stopped in here today based on previous Yelp reviews and let's face it... it's just too hot to do a proper BBQ brisket and not get paid for it ;) I called my buddy up and we agreed to meet here for lunch.   It was a good call :)  THE PARKING LOT SMELLED AWESOME... smokers ablaze and hints of what was to come... my English teacher would have called it foreshadowing...  I arrived first and was happy to see there were some customers already at the bar and in a few of the tables around 1PM on a Saturday afternoon. It's always a little daunting when I walk in and am the only guy in the place. As soon as I walked in, I saw a guy sitting at one of the tables jump up as if to greet me but I gave the "I'm going to the bar" signal and he was all "cool". ;) A plus in my book today as it told me right away that they are a little less formal than your regular restaurant, but still want you to feel immediately welcome... like showing up at a BBQ should be.   I walked down the length of the bar, past a few regulars and overheard conversations of vacations in the islands and a few comments that sounded like "MMMM.. you gotta try this... wait, never-mind, get yer own..." etc. until I found a couple of open stools... I snatched 'em up and was instantly greeted by a bartender singing lines of county songs and twinkling her eyes as if to say "Heya". She got me a beer and I looked over the menu while I waited for my buddy. In the time I waited, she didn't pressure me with the "specials" or even really offer much about the place, and normally I would kind of like a little guidance in a new place, but this is BBQ... if you don't know BBQ, what the hell are you doing in a BBQ joint?! I was cool with it ;) What I really liked was that while there were some TV's and such to occupy my wandering eye, the place was also EXCELLENTLY decorated with light fixtures with actual fillaments... some in mason jars, some in old fan housings. There were overhead beams of solid wood and metal that gave a standard strip mall space some REAL character. I gotta say they put some good thought into the design. And while there are TV's, they were not in the way to distract you from the people you came to enjoy a meal with. That said, this is not the place to come watch TV.   Buddy arrived and we were both happy with the choices on the menu... PLENTY to choose from. All the standards and a few unique items to choose from. I got the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and chips. The coleslaw was NOT on the side... it was on the SANDWICH as it should be for a proper pulled pork sandwich. And I gotta say the bun was perfect. It was bakery fresh and toasted and held up until the very last bite... never got soggy and never fell apart... even though my face and hands were almost always in need of a napkin. The pork was tender, JUICY, and the sauce was the right mix of sweet, savory, and smoke... though I would usually add some spice living in the southwest... but it was a nice change of pace and reminded me of what BBQ is like in the rest of the country. Didn't realize I missed it 'till I had it again.   My buddy had some really tasy Beef Brisket. Now he and I are known in our circle of friends as being able to produce some excellent smoked brisket, so I am always wary of ordering this from a restaurant as its just a difficult thing to keep moist, smokey, and tender if you don't pay attention to the details... A couple bites and I think we agreed these folks are doing it well. Better than most really, in my humble opinion. Certainly better than I've had outside of my or my buddy's backyard.    I also ordered a shot of the house homemade apple pie moonshine. Lemme tell ya fellas, get one. Just shut up and get one. Good stuff. You'll think it has no alcohol at all but me and the buddy just spilt it to see what it tasted like and we could both feel its affects in a minute or two. SMOOTH is not the word for it... more like sneaky!   We also tried the Mac n' Cheese... which was almost overkill at this point but still... a must try... served in a cast iron skillet, with fusilli pasta instead of the usual elbow macaroni, it was a great side to put things just over the top. Creamy, no usual breadding to get in the way, but a nicely browned cheese topping to again bring a little of the BBQ to the dish.   We maxed out and leaned back in our barstools... and had a couple more beers.   Thanks for lunch, Bootleggers. Bettin' we'll be back again soon.

Already my fourth, or is it fifth, visit here... And for good reason! The tacos are great :) Even after this many visits, I still haven't had a chance to try them all... Or all of the margaritas... I keep re-ordering favorites from the last time ;)   Some of those include the carnitas, braised beef, crispy fish, and Baha fish tacos... Do yourself a favor and order three just to get the free side of black beans or roasted vegetables tossed in the guajillo pepita salsa. One trick I plan to try next trip is to order them one or two at a time to ensure they are hot when I'm ready to much 'em down as I discovered after the first two, I needed a slight breather. That gave the Baja taco too much time to cool off. It was still delicious but would have been even better right off the grill.  All the toppings are fresh and crisp and will vary by the taco, but come in deliciously hand made corn tortillas instead of the mass produced machined ones you'll find elsewhere.   Add some guacamole or ceviche as a starter and you'll have PLENTY to feed you AND a friend...   Just like other Upward Projects restaurants, they do Happy Hour all day until 5pm with $5 pitchers, coctails, and wine... Quite the deal :) And just like the other locations, they've done a great job with their employees. They are all VERY well versed in their products, preparations, and customer service skills... You will feel very well taken care of.  My advice... Wear your stretchy pants ;)

Got to spend a fun afternoon/early evening with friends here. Was great to play a few games from childhood and re-live that soul crushing frustration when Inky, Pinky, Blinky, or Clyde get ya with just a few dots left. I did manage to almost save the princess a couple times from Donkey Kong. Plenty of the old school games to make Gen X's feel at home. Good size bar and patio and was quickly able to find a seat when we arrived near 6pm on a Saturday. Lots of people, but lots of room too. The place definitely fills up as the night goes on so you may want to make this a starting point for your evening out. Check in on Yelp and get 10 free tokens! :) Looking forward to new games as they get 'em. Wonder how long it will be 'tll Dragon's Lair...
