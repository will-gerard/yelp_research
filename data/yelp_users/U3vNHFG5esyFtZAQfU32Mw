I will admit the food is good, the service is as quick as a fast food drive thru restaurant. Eventhough the service was quick, it was very unfriendly, I guess that's the price you have to pay for quick service. Another thing, they are not kid friendly. If you have kids under the age of 15 years old, do not take them there. My 1 year old was playing with chopsticks and dropped them on the floor, the lady cleaning of the tables, picked them up and ran away with them, never to be seen again. She never brought us another pair of chopsticks to replace the ones she took. Of course, we didn't need them, my wife was using a fork and I was using my chopsticks. I think they didn't like my kid playing with the chopsticks, so that may be why they took them away and didn't bring us an extra pair.  In conclusion, I would eat there again, but only carry out. I will never sit there and eat. There is too many other restaurants out there, to have to settle on such an unfriendly place.

I've been meaning to write a review for this place for a long time because it's so good. It's straight up good food, the menu is unique without being to out there and crazy. They have this breakfast burrito that they stuff with "chicken fried steak, french fries, eggs, cheese, sausage and they smother the whole thing with country gravy and more cheese. They don't have anything like that at IHOP.

So, this mexican restaurant is just like any other mexican restaurant in the valley. If you like the same ol', same ol' kind of Mexican food then you'll like this place. On the other hand I like the more modern style mexican restaurants myself. One thing that really got me and irritated the heck out of me about this place is serving the food out of a plastic tray. I feel like I'm back in Junior High School. I want real plates, round plates, I prefer squared plates but it doesn't really matter as long as they are actual plates. In conclusion, I will probably never go to this restaurant ever again. If I wanted to be served food in this manner, I would go to "Filiberto's" and get me a "number1" combo plate and then proceed to pour it into my dog dish and then eat it (save some money this way).

Does anyone know what "Chow fun" is? It's one of my favorite chinese food dishes. The people at the house of eggrolls had no idea what I was talking about. I don't read or speak any deviations of any of the Chinese dialects. So I did not know what half the menu was(the menu is mostly in Chinese). None of the people behind the cash register could tell me what anything was. If you can't read any of Chinese dialects, don't go there. Chances are, anything you order there, will be a surprise. If you like surprises, this is the place for you.

I like the service my drinks came really fast. The waiter/bartender was really cool and friendly, he called me "boss"; I love it when waiters call me "boss", anyways. I wasn't a big fan of the dish wear, I don't like being served good food in a plastic tray but the food was delicious.

This laundrymat is amazing. It is a cool and hip place to hangout while doing your laundry. What makes it so hip & cool is all the flatscreens on the wall. During College football season I like to go do my laundry and catch a game while waiting for my clothes to finish. The staff is friendly and very easy on the eyes (if you know what I mean). Flatscreens on the walls and friendly staff what more do you need? Oh...they also wash and fold your laundry 0.99 cents a pound, best deal in town if you ask me.

"YAY! I was a fan" until last night. Me and my wife used to love this place, it was on our top 3 Happy Hour spots. Until I tried to order a "Tequila Mockingbird" and the whole place was stomped, no one knew what was in it. The bartender literally asked everyone in the restaurant and the owner what was in it and how to make one, she also asked me what was in it. So I told her how to make one, she tried, it wasn't that good but I didn't tell her that, because I didn't wanna be rude. I strongly believe with all my heart that this restaurant should change its name to NOT have "Modern Tequila Bar" in it. Because the only thing they know how to do is pour pre-mixed drinks into a cup or pour beer out of a tap. I go out to bars to get drinks I can't make at home if I wanted to pour myself a pre-mixed Margarita from a bottle I would just stay home. If you want a sophisticated Tequila Cocktail drink then the "Canteen Modern Tequila Bar" is NOT the place for you. I personaly will not be going there ever again until they change their name and take out the word "Tequila" from it.

Do not let "Olga" cut your hair. Some hairstylists are clueless about men's haircuts. My hair wasn't blended in. The sides were shaved with a number 1, and then she texturized the top a little bit. And then the haircut was over. I don't think she was aware she was supposed to blend that little line that went all the way around my head. It was a basic haircut. All I said was "number 1 fade on the side, nothing off the top". Simple enough, but she forgot the "fade" portion of the haircut. My haircut literally looks like, I got it cut at the beauty school. A beauty school haircut is a 5 dollar haircut, it's so cheap because it is done by beauty school students. That's what my haircut looks like, a 5 dollar haircut.

The tall deli guy with a beard guard and glasses was very rude. I am not sure if he worked in the deli or just the meat section. He refused to weigh our turkey. We were picking out turkeys for thanksgiving and one of the turkeys did not have a label on it. We took the turkey to him and asked if he could weigh it. He said that they could  not weigh it back there in the meat department  but they could weigh it, at the cash registers in the front. We get to the register and we tell the cashier the situation, and she thought it was kind of awkward that they couldn't  weigh in the back, in the meat department. She actually said, that's  where they weigh and label all the turkeys, in the meat department. I felt offended and disrespected that he couldn't pop that turkey on the scale, it would've only took him 5 seconds out of his "busy"day. The prices are not worth the poor service, I will not be shopping at any Winco stores from now on. At least, I will not be shopping at the one on Willis and Arizona Ave. ever again. If you are at this location and you are looking for service at the meat department, please avoid the tall guy with glasses and the beard guard. He will not assist you. Well, maybe if he's having a good day, he will.
