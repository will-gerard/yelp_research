This is an honest review, I am not just jumping on the "screw the VA" bandwagon. I showed up for a blood draw at 7:00AM, before the lab even opens and there was a gigantic line. First you have to draw a number to even be checked in  and then you have to wait until your number is called to go back and get your blood drawn. From 0700 to 0723, I waited to check in. Once that was done I waited from 0723 to 0952 to be called back for my blood draw. The blood draw itself took under 40 seconds total.  On February 17th, 2015 I called and wanted to schedule a Dr. appointment because I was not feeling well. They called me back and said that the next available appointment was today, April 1. I accepted this appointment, having no other choice. As I pulled in this morning and experienced a minor miracle, finding a parking space, I received another call that said that she had called in sick, no I could not see another doctor but her next available appointment was April 22. Having no other choice I accepted this new appointment.   I receive prompt, good-quality mental healthcare at the VA from the OIF/OEF/OND clinic but the rest of the hospital is poorly organized, poorly run, and overwhelmed. If this was a civilian doctor, I would be finding another healthcare provider.

I have eaten here a couple of times and have always been satisfied with the quality and quantity of my food. The reason I felt compelled to write this review is amazing customer service.  So my wife is particular about the way her over-medium eggs are cooked and this morning she ordered them this way and recieved them between over-easy and over-medium. Being the awesome wife that she is she remarked on it and proceeded to cut them up to eat anyways. As she was doing so, our server (Hope M.) approached and asked if her eggs were undercooked. She explained that she also eats them over-medium and saw that they were not perfect and already put in an order for perfectly cooked eggs. My wife and I were both impressed that without any complaints, the server paid so much attention to us that she noticed a little dissatisfaction and acted to remedy the situation. One thing that will always earn my gratitude and repeat visits is customer service and The Good Egg does it right!! Oh, and my Lumberjack Skillet was also yummylicious!

I love red robin! All of the burgers come with endless fries! What is not to love?

Great food! I have been to one of the other locations on Southern and both are amazing! My favorites are the seared ahi with hummus and the grilled vegetable entr√©e!

Long time member of 24-hour Fitness here and this one is my home gym because it is a couple of minutes from my house. This gym is the worst I have encountered in terms of facility renovations needed. The light fixtures in the pool area have rusted completely over so you can't even tell what kind of metal it used to be and the glass covers do not stay on over the lights. All of the tiles in the pool area could use a thorough powerspray or replacement. The sauna has the glass brick window/walls that are cracked and broken. The mens shower area is actually alright, showers work, lockers work and it does not smell like a gym sock (props to the cleaning staff, who are nice, btw). The walls in the actual gym area are scuffed, marked, and more holey than my daddy's bible. There are at least five spots that I know of that need a hole patched in them. The cardio equipment is in serious need of repair and replacement and some of the cables on the machines are dangerous. Last of all, the hours... I have insomnia so sometimes at 1 AM on a weekend I decide to go get my pump on and it is mildy irritating to have to drive to Mesa Riverview to do so, even if there equipment is better. The name of the place is 24-HOUR FITNESS! WHY IS MY GYM NOT OPEN FOR 24 HOURS??? On the plus side the staff I have talked are friendly and sociable! I hope they remodel because the building is nice it is just 30 years out of date.

My Arizona Burger was cooked perfectly, and my wife was impressed at the quality of food for what is essentially a small sports bar. The waitstaff was friendly and responsive. 10/10 Would come again. Four stars because the menu is not too extensive but seems to be cooked well. My wife made a joke about a "hidden gem" so that comment goes in here too.

So far I have only had pho tai chin and it was fantastic. I am glad to have found a great pho joint so close to me! Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu!  Edit: Awesome, absolutely great. I have gone many, many times for late breakfast or lunch and I am never disappointed. The waitstaff is very friendly and always on the spot for drink refills and advice on what to get! I cannot recommend enough!

We have been coming here on Saturday mornings for a couple of weeks and I just had to let you all know how great they are. Every bit of food that we have ordered has been top notch and every server has given absolutely exemplary service. I recommend any of their skillets and to start out with a cinnamon roll for the table. The servers remember us and events in our lives that we casually discussed with them and enquire about these events when we come in. This level of attention to detail and dedication to customer service is far above and beyond what is normal for the area. I absolutely love Crackers and Co. Cafe and cannot recommend them enough!

It had been a while since I had Italian food so the wife and I randomly picked RigaTony's and we are damn glad we did! The interior is tastefully decorated and charming and it has a cozy atmosphere without crowding the tables together.   The food starts with a sample of wine and an excellent salad and bread fresh from the oven, I had the Fettucini Alfredo with a meatball and it was just fantastic! The wife had the Fettucini Alfredo with Chicken Lemon and Artichoke which was delectable!  Our service was prompt (we came at 4:30pm on a Wednesday) and our server was friendly, sociable, and helpful!   Good Job RigaTony's!!!

I have brought my bike in several more times to Mike and he has proven himself again and again as one of the most motorcycle knowledgeable guys that I know.   He has even diagnosed a problem a couple times over the phone for me based solely on my description of the problem and make and model of my bike.  He consistently charges much lower rates for his time, work and knowledge than other shops do.  I am continually impressed with him, his shop and his work ethic and cannot recommend this shop enough.

Went here before catching a performance at GCU. Fabulous. There is one lady working staff so it is a nice place to sit and talk for a bit. The Jerk Chicken was fantastic, just spicy enough to break out in a light sweat but very delicious. The ladies had the Jerk Chicken Salad which they enjoyed as well. I will be returning and sampling more of the selections from the menu! P.S. The fried plantain is to die for!

After being in pain for years from an old back injury, I hobbled in to Rod's place and was able to walk out tall and proud! I recommend him to anyone who is in pain; mental, emotional and physical!

The wife and I were in the area and decided on breakfast out for Saturday Morning. We saw the high rating and boy, do they deserve it! There were at least six parties in front of us but we were seated in under 10 minutes. The atmosphere of the place is busy, bustling, and loud. I ordered the Cajun Andouille Sausage and Chedder Scramble and the wife ordered the Chicken Apple Sausage Scramble. Our order was on the table in under 5 minutes. We both opted for the home fries upon the recomendation of our server and they were very good. Perfectly seasoned with a firm crust on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. We also both opted for a biscuit and paid extra for the gravy. Soooo worth it. Thier gravy was made from real sausage, slighty sweet with a hint of warm spices, fantastic. The scrambles were mostly large chunks of delicious and succulent sausage, with just the right amount of cage-free eggs and cheese. The coffee was good, standard higher end restaurant fare and the service was amazing. The servers and staff were fast, polite, and accomadating. We will be coming back!

We went to Shabu Fondu with a group and we had a great experience! The staff was friendly, accomodating, and helpful. The food was great and it was fun to cook it yourself. The menu is rather extensive and it would be easy to eat vegetarian here. They served there water with some cucumber and that was also tasty. The wife and I had the Curry and Shabu Beef, Broccoli, Bok Choy and Rice Noodles. It was a winning combo!

As I was eating I was surprised at the relatively low star count. My food was delicious and promptly served and the wait staff was kind enough to answer all my questions. They also serve six beers on tap, coffees and desserts. I also would like to try some of their new breakfast menu! We will definitely be back!!

I discovered this restaurant by searching for restaurants near me with grubhub. I ordered a salad, hotbowl, and panini at the same time. All were very good even though I did not eat them immediately. I have been to the physical location several times since, the staff is very friendly and they don't mind any substitutions that you make. I am in love with thier hotbowls. Salads are nice and fresh and the paninis are super. If you have not been I recommend you go check then out tonight!
