This hospital took really good care of me when i was rushed here a year ago due to a fibroid issue I knew nothing about. I was able to get into ER FAST and they did all types of test on me to where I was getting annoyed but they were trying to help me. They got me a nice room with warm blankets and got me into surgery the same day. One of the nurses stayed in the room with me almost all night after the surgery and made sure I did my exercises. Very pleasant to talk too. Food was great and so was dessert! I would definitely come back here if I needed help.

There's always one person doing a pedi and one doing nails. Never enough people working and when you come in they give you a high wait time because it's just two of them. Average service. Nothing special about them. Decent price. $20 for a pedicure.

On December 28, 2015 I was about to fly out to Dallas and wanted to wear one of my boots. Saw that the bottom of the heel had come off and it was showing the nail. I called this place and he said he could fix it now. I told him great and I was there in 5 mins. Took him less than 5 mins to fix the heel and he charged me $5. I was very pleased and I was able to make my flight for my vacation. I'll definitely come back here again.

Went here today and it's small but it's filled with a variety of good items. I found 3 nice Blazers and a pair of pants for less than $35. I was impressed. I had to get out of there before I found other things to buy. The workers there were nice and helpful. It appears that they mix the juniors and women's clothes together. I grabbed some pants and they still didn't fit but were the right size. I would definitely come back again.

Never enough employees working especially in the morning. Food is good and customer service is standard. Just wish they had more people working there to speed up the process.

This was my first time here and I had a good experience. I walked in with books to sell and they offered me a GREAT value for trade instead. The gentleman helped me find the section for African American Urban Fiction and it was a very small selection. He explained to me that not a lot of people bring books in for that genre and not a lot of them sell. I explained because the selection that is being traded in is not that great..LOL.. i did tell him I have a lot to give to them once I have finished reading them so I hope it helps. I did notice they have other things there besides books. They even have jewelry. I didn't get a chance to look at them but I will the next time I go in there. I found two good books for trade and I look forward to going back soon. Oh yeah by the way the man that was helping me did explain to me how they find the prices for the books. They charge half of the regular price of a book, so if there is a hardback book you want and the regular price is $15 then it would be $7.50.  :)

Received a nice facial and the prices for their services are affordable. I felt a difference in my skin after the pampering. I was worried being that I am African American and not sure if they would have someone there to assist with my skin. The nice woman on the phone assured me that there will be someone there who specializes on my pigmentation. When I got there is was nice and clean. Friendly staff! Besides the woman in the next room beside me talking I wasn't able to relax like I wanted too. Which the rooms were enclosed so you can enjoy the experience peacefully. Overall I would definitely come back again if I was not moving to Dallas this week. When I come back to Phoenix I would try and come back here to visit.

I LOVE this hotel! Customer Service is excellent!!! They really know how to handle the customers and make sure you're comfortable. I would've have it 5 stars if I in-room dining was nicer when asking for silverware. I called to get a fork and I guy (wish I had gotten his name) told me it would be a $1.25/per item brought up. I needed 3 forks. I told him I would come down and get it and he straight cut me off and told me No I couldn't. Well excuse me!!! Liquid pool was ok. You can tell who the broke people are because you have to pay to sit. So anybody standing around let's you Know they don't have money to pay for a cabana or a ottoman. They don't even have shade! The pool is super small too. Even to have a table at the bar is a minimum $250. Other than that the hotel is great! Very huge! Club Haze was great Saturday night. DJ could've been better. He played more house than hip hop and top 40. Food at the hotel is great especially the Aria Cafe!! Late night menu is very pricey but the quality of the food is excellent. Took the slippers home and left the robe since they wanted $75 for it LOL. Maybe for Christmas. I would love to stay here again one day. :)

Nice clean place to wash but not enough parking. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars. There are people here to help with the machines and keep the place nice. Tvs and wifi available here. I come here all the time to wash and so far haven't had a bad experience. I'll keep coming here until I get my own W&D.

I met Jenny in 2010 and that was my first time being sugared ever. She made me feel comfortable and she took her time with me. When I moved  back to AZ I called her to make sure she was still at the same location. I was so glad to know that she is still there. She promised me when we first met that once I got sugared I wouldn't go back to waxing again and she is right! I appreciate her professionalism, her open availability and her knowledge of her products. I would recommend her to anybody that wants an alternative method to waxing and having better results.

Friendly Staff and had a good rate. Only used storage for 2 weeks. Would have given it 5 stars if I didn't find a huge roach on my king size mattress. Unit was clean when I got it. Cameras are all around so felt safe leaving my items there.

This review is for the STORE location and not customer service for over the phone. Every time I've came into this store for help whether to pick up/return equipment that have been VERY helpful and didn't rush me when I had questions. They are generous with giving you cords and I was able to get an HDMI cord for FREE! They only negative thing is it's always busy and people are waiting but they are efficient with everything. Make sure to get there before 7pm because they lock the doors on time.

Long wait in line to place order, chicken was good, didn't have enough greens on my plate for a side item and the Mac and cheese was too greasy and there wasn't enough cheese. Would I eat from here again? NO! I'm from the south and I wasn't impressed at all. My co worker had their peach cobbler where the crust was doughy and not cooked. He threw it away. Told him to call and go back to the truck and show them but we were at work and couldn't leave so he wrote a Yelp review of his experience. Still haven't found a REAL southern spot yet here in AZ. Might have to move away. Food truck was highly disappointing!

Excellent Customer Service. Received texts and phone calls to let me know the status of my vehicle. Went out of town for my birthday trip that was planned before my accident. I was told my vehicle was going to be completed while i was out of town. This company allowed my car to sit there with no storage fees and i really appreciated it. They even came and picked me up to get my car since i returned the rental the day i went out of town. I would definitely come back here again if anything else happens to my car. My car looks flawless again. THANK YOU!

I was so nervous going to get my hair done at this salon because every time I go somewhere to get a wash and flat iron NOBODY can get my hair bone straight without using the marcel iron. I have thick coarse hair by the way. Well Crystal did her thing! I got my hair washed by Tanita and when it came to the conditioner she gave me a really good massage on my scalp where I almost fell asleep. She detangled me really good too. After the wash Crystal started to detangled my hair to get ready to blow dry me. She was very gentle with the process and flat iron my hair really good. Looks like I have a relaxer. She gave me a really good cut too. Cut all the split ends and I have a lot of body in my hair. I'm so thankful I found her on yelp and her prices are affordable too. I've already booked another appointment in two weeks. I have found my new beautician. Thank you Crystal!

This review is for Vanessa. I seen her for 2 years and I just love her. She is very thorough with you and actually cares about your health. I am going to miss her when I move to Dallas. I wish I could take her with me. I have my close friend seeing her now and if you want an OBGYN that is caring then ask for Vanessa. You won't be disappointed.   Now as for the staff behind the desk they have no energy and just basic customer service. The office is nice, clean and comfy. I would definitely come back here if I wasn't moving. Took one star off for the girls behind the desk but Vanessa gets 5 stars!!!

So it's been a year that I have been to this salon and a lot has changed for the better. New location and plenty of parking available. She has more staff and one of them just trimmed my ends 2 weeks ago and I really like. I can't remember the lady's name but she sat me down in her chair extra early sine I arrives their early. Then she took her time trimming my natural hair in the dry natural state too. She was very thorough and pleasant to speak too. This salon still has a repeat customer which is ME!

First time here due to the fact the place I normally go to had a long wait time. Pulled up Yelp, called around and found this place. Saw they had great reviews and decided to call. The man on the phone was real nice and asked if I could show up in 15 mins. Sure! Got there and he was standing behind the reception desk waiting. Very nice atmosphere. He told me they just opened up 2 months ago. Everything is new and sanitized. Went to a nice massage chair and they use Saran wrap for the foot tub and plastic on the remote for the massage chair. Candy did my mani and pedi. Very nice job and she even helped with the ingrown toenails. That's a plus since I can never find a nail tech that knows how to handle that. Anyways she was very nice and detailed with her work. Once done she gave me a zip lock bag with the file, scrub brush for the feet and nail buffer. Asked if I should bring that back and she said no. Take it home or throw it away. When you come back we will give you another one. I was shocked to know they don't reuse the supplies on other people feet. Received a nice manicure from Candy too. Very nice first experience and rescheduled an appt again in two weeks. I believe I found my new nail salon. Oh and the prices are reasonable too. They ONLY reason why I didn't give them 5 stars is because they want their tips to be CASH ONLY. Being this was last minute and first time there I didn't know that. When paying I asked could I add the tip to my card and he gave me a look like we prefer cash. Reminded him this is my First time here. I didn't know that. Whats the big deal anyways with that. You're getting a tip either way. So because of that they receive 4 stars.

Sorry to do this because I was a regular customer that came in every 2 weeks for months and then stopped after an incident 3 months ago. I ALWAYS booked an appt with the same nail technician and because she was the only one available most of the time she was working on someone during my appt time. There was a time I waited almost an hour and I had booked an appt. I went and said something to the man at the desk about this and was going to leave because I don't see the point of making appts and you know I come every 2 weeks that you would book her during my time slot. I've also witnessed that they just want to fill the seats in there regardless if there's enough people to assist them. So you're sitting there soaking your feet or just waiting on someone to help you. I rather they tell customers a time frame so they can make an informed decision on if they want to wait or not. After the long wait the man at the desk did offer me a 10% discount for the inconvenience but I was done with the place. This wasn't the first time it has happened and I made sure it was the last. I decided to go back to the place I went to before since they are more honest with time frames and appreciate customers time.   The place is nice and relaxing if you can just sit there and relax without someone coming asking you various questions while at the shop. I'm hoping by now they have gotten a lot better with their time management.

So it took me 3 months later to go back. Called and spoke to the man in the front said let's try this again and see if the experience is better. Tried it and everything was cool. Came back a second time ( 2 weeks later ) and was greeted by the same man at the front asking me about my previous review. Due to the language barrier what I got from what he was saying is that I left that 3 star review and I need to fix it since I did come back last time. I said if you felt so strongly about it why didn't you mention it when I came back 2 weeks ago. He calmed down because someone came in behind me but I started questioning him. You're not going to show out in front of me when there is no one around. Then he went on to mention that "no one" can schedule an appointment with Kim anymore. I honestly think that's a lie. I saw a woman come in waiting for her just because she was a long time customer. I believe he only said that to just me and that's fine because I was done with this place and really mean it. Service is slow and the man at the counter only cares about filling seats and letting people wait. What's the point of scheduling an appointment if it's not going to be honored. Time management is terrible and I'm sure one of them will send me a message about this on here. Don't want to hear it! Didn't really like the SNS either. Went back to gel with a woman that I found on IG and the quality is way better and you get more for the same price. Due to the man at the counter unprofessional mannerism and previous experience here overall they get the 1 star from me. I won't ever come back. Too many options around here to come back to this place. Good riddance.

I have been in AZ for 4 years and I have never found a "Real" soul food place that I like. I am from the South and I miss my southern food. Yesterday I was at my friend's house and was scrolling through Yelp to find a place to eat. I came across this place and was skeptical b/c I have been disappointed before by so called southern places. The reviews and pictures of the food looked really good so I decided to give it a try and take my friend with me. We walk in and you can smell the great food in the air. I walk to the counter where a nice woman greeted me and I told her I found their place on yelp. She mentioned the owner took over 3 months ago. I ordered the dinner special and I was skeptical again about the candied yams and cornbread. She offered me a sample of the yams and before I taste it I smelt it and I knew it was going to be great. Tasting it confirmed it! I was and still in love with them. I asked her if the cornbread has kernel corns in them and she told me no. I was very happy b/c it seems like a west coast thing with kernel in the cornbread. I never heard of that until I moved out here. She did tell me that it will take about 15 mins for the food to be ready since they cook the meat made to order. We were fine with that. When we got our food everything was GREAT! I had a lot of catfish nuggets and have a lot for leftovers for work. I re-ordered some more of the sides (mac and cheese, yams and greens) for my lunch too. The owner and the nice woman are doing their thing in the kitchen. If I wasn't moving to Dallas this Friday I would definitely be coming back. I did get some flyers and passed them out at work since they mentioned they do deliver. I wish this place was here a long time ago. If you can't be patient for 15 mins to wait for soul food cooked fresh from scratch then this is not the place for you. People that knows great soul food knows that's a standard wait time. I hope this business succeeds in AZ.

I was sketchy about coming here based off the reviews but I wanted pancakes and this is close to where I live so I gave it a try. As soon as I walked in I was seated right away. A waitress came and took my drink order and then another one named Jessie came with my water and asked if I was ready to order. Placed my order and it wasn't even 15 mins and my food came out nice and hot. She brought me warm syrup too. My service was good with my waitress and I'm glad I had a better experience than what I thought. I left there full and happy.
