This is by far the best panda I've ever been to they are always so nice and pleasant. I've never had a problem here and they give me bigger portions than the other ones I have gone too.  I always mix up what I get from here.   I really miss the sesame chicken they had. I hope they bring it back soon  The place is always clean and neat

This was my first visit here. My boyfriend and his family are regulars. He took me on a 1 yr. Anniversary date here and it was great until our server decided to choose me as his victim.  I'm a soft spoken person until someone is rude or mean to me for no reason  He was rude,  forgot my rice, never refilled my drink,  and kept starring at the hostesses.   But the cook was so amazing and nice.  It was great watching him cook all the food and we got served lovely shrimp,  zucchini,  and other veggies before the main coarse.  Delicious and definitely worth this experience.

The best sushi bar I've been too.  You can custom order rolls , ask for them to make fresh stuff  And there's even cream puffs,  cheesecake or pudding for dessert I personally love it and so do all my friends that I've brought here

Went for the st. Patrick's day event and it was the best experience my group of friends and I had.  We all had so much fun!!!!!  There were games to play,  everyone around us was really nice. My main thing about bars are the staff.  The staff here are some of the best I've seen on mill Ave.  Nice,  attentive,  good attitudes.   Love it,  definitely going back with more friends

First off I'm extremely allergic to gluten, and a few other things including some flowers, and they didn't even ask if I had allergies they just assume everyone is perfectly okay using they're vegan products....I wanted to try a honey thing and she grabbed a floral thing and I immediately broke out in hives and had to wash my hands off in their sink with proper soap...   Update--- The staff has switched and they are way sweeter, and very sincere. They ask before they test products now

Overpriced sub-par mediocre sushi....and rude people.  We usually go to Teharu in Scottsdale where the same rainbow roll is $2 and made fresh vs. Sushu station which costs $5 and very dry and small.  I hate leaving bad reviews but it was dimly lit, hard to read off the menu and seating was uncomfortable.  I paid for the few rolls we attempted but didn't finish and left.  I understand how reviews work, and im assuming someone is gonna attempt to "reach out" to me....please dont, everyone is different and has the right to express their experiences.

Layne is phenomenal!!! Made me so welcome, and my first sugar brazillian was such a great experience. I hughly recommend her. Shes wonderful, kind, and very comforting and experienced. Im so glad i got a membership. No more razor blades or funky creams for me. Sugaring is the way to go!!! So go make an appointment NOW

Orders are always messed up...never remembers to give sauce, and not really sure if anyone speaks english there.. My boyfriend took 3 of us to rallys and everyone single one of us was upset with our order..my chicken was served cold, and they messed up 2 of the bacon burgers...BACON BURGERS ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BACON ON THEM
