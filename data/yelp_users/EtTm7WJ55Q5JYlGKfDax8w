The honorable Mister Barack Obama came here to eat and quite frankly I don't see why.  Hopefully he was just in the area and this wasn't actually on his agenda.  The food was not all that great and the service wasn't up to par either.  The funniest thing about it was we were the only ones there on this particular evening.  Anyhow, I think there are probably better places to eat in the area.  The building is very large and multi colored.  The bathrooms were very clean and the booth we were in was comfortable.

The baristas is here are awesome and the store is very clean.  The bathrooms were extremely clean when I went in there.  The baked goods were good to go and the drinks came out in a hurry.  I like this location and the people.  Would come back again

Can't give a review.  Accidental check in.  No pun intended...

This location and staff are wonderful.  The food prepared here was great.  I saw one individual wash his hands about seven times in the length of me at the end of the line to paying for our meal.  This location gets a lot of cater orders so be prepared to maybe wait a little longer than normal around lunch hours.  Otherwise it'll be smooth coasting.
