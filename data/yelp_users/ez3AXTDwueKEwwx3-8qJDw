Took my car in for an oil change. With a coupon it wasn't bad and they use valvoline so I was happy. They said I needed a new air filter seems I always need one everytime I take my car in. My Dad had just checked it a few weeks ago and said it was fine! Whatever. Then they said I had a tail light out. Yikes! Well it really wasn't a tail light which I can get a ticket for, but the back light on the window. Jeez, I think I will go to autozone and repair it myself. They did quote me with a 45 minute wait and it was right on. Though, I was sitting in the waiting area and they called me on my cell to tell me it was ready, UH hello McFly!!!

Alter a 14 month leave of being a client, I have returned! I lost my beloved Norton to oral melanoma in October 2009. Norton was always cared for by Dr. Kevin Butler who was wonderful and kind. I just adopted Howie on December 16th and found myself back at Power Road Animal Hospital because of the caring staff. Dr. Butler has moved out of state and I find myself with Dr. Stephens. Dr. Stephens actually performed Norton's emergency surgery and biopsy right before Norton passed away. He was compassionate and knowledgeable sooooo he is stuck with me and Howie. Upon his wellness exam on the day of his adoption, Dr. Stephens was so very thorough and excited with Howie's health. This is a big step for me to adopt again and a thrilling yet fun experience. Once I had Howie home, I noticed some lumps on his neck. I rushed him back and Howie had ticks. I adopted him from the pound and it is quite normal for them to have bugs unfortunately. And just 2 days ago I called and Howie had developed a dry hacking cough. Dr. Stephens immediately returned my phone call and he explained so clearly that he had kennel cough. I picked up a 2 week antibiotic and he was very clear that Howie was not to have any of his boosters or be neutered until he was healthy. The exact way I felt. I am so pleased to have a Dr. for Howie that has his best interest and health first. Thanks Dr. Stephens and thanks to Nicole who is so amazing as well!!!

Howie John has a small allergy problem and was scratching his eye.  I called and they got me an appointment within 20 minutes.  Dr. Stephens is the best.  HJ just loves him and he makes you feel like a special Mom.  He ran a die test on his eye to make sure there was corneal scratch and gave us meds.  He complimented HJ on his good behavior.  Would trust this Dr. with any of my animals.  Thanks for being so kind and understanding!!!

Yikes! What a stinkin' nightmare! First of all, this would not be a first choice for me, but on a Sunday night there is not much open past 11pm. As I sat down to meet my friend his drink was delivered. Do you think that if you saw a new person sitting at the table you would ask what they would like??? NOT! We had to wait 10 minutes, and I am not exaggerating, for the waiter to come back and ask what I would like. So I ordered the nastiest glass of wine ever. Seriously do not order the Rex Goliath, seriously don't drink there unless you are a beer drinker... After what seemed like another 10 minutes we finally ordered. When the nachos, yes I said nachos arrived we asked for extra napkins as there was only 1 setup on the table. He gave us a stack of cocktail napkins. Really? Nachos and cocktail napkins. Well I got up and got another setup from another table. My friend ordered a beer at that time and after, I kid you not, 15 minutes he had to reorder because he seemed to have forgotten about the order. The nachos tasted like store bought chips and threw a few beans on them, sprinkled a little cheese and meat and threw on some peppers to make it look pretty. Definitely not the tastiest nachos in Mesa!!! Not a good experience both service and food wise. Next time I would rather stay home...

So yes I went back.  And YUM!  The chips and salsa are really my fave.  It didn't seem so chaotic as my last visit and my waiter was so accomodating.  I had a cheese crisp with beans, black olives, and onions and it really satisfied  my craving.  Can't wait to go back for more...  And the iced tea is fresh!

Delicious!  Last night I had a wonderful pizza with pineapple, black olives, and bacon!  And a fabulous side dish of pesto sauce for dipping.  So it isn't fancy or well decorated, but the service is simple and friendly, the food is amazing and simply fresh and their passion iced tea is delightful.  SOY FREE pizza for those of you with food allergies!!!

So another time and the same place and I cannot tell you how great this place is. Their pizzas are so delish, I have a hard time deciding between the pizza and sandwiches. Homemade breads are so delish, they should package them and sell them. Everyone is always so nice and just a great place. This time I did a to-go pizza and just taking it out of the oven when I walk in the door. YUM! pipping hot and so delish, they never skimp on the toppings and the crust is just perfect, light and a little crisp. I consider myself a regular and don't even hesitate on where to-go for my pizza now. There is no comparison!!!

This is a fabulous place to go when you have been induced with medical supplements while undergoing tests! After spending the majority of the day at Mayo Clinic, my girlfriends and I ventured here for some well-needed nourishment. The fasting thing does not work well for me! In my drug induced state, I ate all 6 pickles, yep ate them all and boy were they tasty as ever. And then I ordered a liverwurst sandwich with onions and cheese on rye bread! Really? Yes, really. And it was superb! Let's just say the entire experience is but a blurrrrrrr, but the service was good, fast, and the food amazing. Then I needed some dessert! The fridge is full of lots of goodies. Now that I am coherent again, I just shake my head and help myself to some rugallah every time I pass through the kitchen. OH WELL, I deserve a little reward for all I have been through today! :)

Really? What is up with this place? Can I ever walk out of here without being stuffed and not having finished my meal????   I tried to be smart this time ordering a half sandwich-still too much. Thank goodness I take my doggie bags home to my little 4-legger who enjoys good meat:) The pickles are the best thing going. I just love them and can't go there without eating the entire dish of them. I was there mid morning and although not completely packed with people it was pretty full. The sandwich was so good on Jewish rye. I wish there was a location closer to where I live and then I would be in trouble cuz I think I would be there every day. Great place to go with friends after a medical procedure. Great location! Great Food. Great Service!!!!!

Let me just say I hate having car problems and being a girl!!!   I woke up this morning and hopped in my car ready to start my day. I got the click click click click when I turned the key and just froze. Yikes really? I saw a roofer guy working across the street and wish I knew who he worked for so I could give him a huge kudos. Anyway, he jumped my car and off I went. Now, what about that receipt for the battery, where did I put it? Yeah, I found it in my car file, amazing I actually did it right this time, LOL!. I headed to autozone and the guy came right out and tested my battery, I gave him my receipt because it was a 7yr battery and it has only been 25 months since I purchased it. So they prorated it and gave me credit towards my new battery and installed it in less than 5 minutes. What a great relief and no hassles and the guy even said that I didn't need the receipt that they go by your phone number, so just in case next time... Good to remember. So no idle chit chat, just fix and go. Thanks autozone!

Humeira, the pharmacist, is so friendly and knowledgeable! Today's visit was a bit slower than usual because EVERYONE is sick. I had a prescription called in and it took a few hours to fill it, but the staff is so great and I just love the drive-thru!

Fresh and Cheap...Cheap and Fresh...  This place is the best.  I just picked up 40 ears of corn for $4.  Yes, can you believe it?  I cut the tops and bottoms off the ears and left the husks on and put in bags and into the freezer.  Had the first batch last night right out of the freezer and it tasted just like FRESH from the field:)  LOL!  So it is a little out of the way, but you cannot beat the produce and the prices.  The older folks just flock to this place and sometimes it is hard to find a parking spot and sometimes the lines are soooooo long it drives you nuts, but it is so worth it!

This place is great for both 2 leggers (homo-sapiens) and 4 leggers (dogs)! I love going to the butcher and getting exactly what you want instead of digging through packaged meat trying to find the right piece. Their porterhouse steaks are divine, and they will even give you a "women's" cut for the petite eater. They also have leg bones for the little ones. They happened to be out and they cut a dozen bones to the dimensions I wanted. Please make sure your little one eats them outside because they do get bloody and gross. Also throw them away after they finish or they do attract ants. Obviously I have learned the hard way:( I cannot tell you how happy I have been with their steaks and yes they do cost a little bit more but the are so worth the price!!! The store reminds me of going to the butcher downtown Chicago as a child with my Mom. The place is full of older folks who do value a good piece of meat. Yummers!!!

Well it is about time I finally get to writing a review for this place. I have been here 10+ times and there is nothing to complain about. I don't eat sushi but my other half loves it... They are so accommodating with the fact that I don't eat sushi. Let's say I only eat shrimp, crab, and lobster. So, Miki (?) the sushi chef comes up with things I do like. She takes the time to listen and come up with some great things for me. Also, I am allergic to soy and she makes adjustments. She makes me a roll with shrimp and cream cheese wrapped in cucumber with sesame seeds. It is delish with no soy sauce. She made a veggie roll with mango, asparagus and cream cheese which was delish. I guess if you have a sushi lover, you must make adjustments and I am thrilled that they have helped me enjoy my meals too. My fav is the beef rice with no soy! Love the garlic in it! Thanks Miki!!!

SURPRISE! Yes I had a surprise birthday party here and it was amazing. I pre-ordered food and beer and Saki and then ordered more. They were amazing and couldn't have asked for a better night or better service. There were 14 of us there and the food was raved about-but then there were "regulars" in the group so why wouldn't they like it. We had some non-sushi eaters and they enjoyed shrimp, beef, and chicken. What a great atmosphere for a small gathering and they were awesome!!!

So far this has been the most impressive medical experience I have ever had. Though it seems that you are just a piece going down the production line, there is little room for error. Everything is so precise that it just runs like clockwork. Everyone has such a positive outlook and it is such a different warmer feeling environment. Upon meeting my physician yesterday, I was shocked that I didn't have to cold into a cold room and wait for him, I was brought into a room where the Dr. was waiting for me. The room had a sofa and it was such a comfortable experience. He spent an hour going over my medical history and then made the plan of what is to happen. Then I went to wait for the scheduling department to plan my itinerary. Very pleasant experience.

So...I have been back to Mayo twice since my initial visit. The first procedure went well, yes I loved having the happy drugs and don't recall much from that day. My friends enjoyed my behavior and thanks to them I arrived safely at home that afternoon. What I do like about Mayo is the consistency and promptness. For this particular appointment I checked in, they made copies of my medical power of attorney and living will. Yes, they actually stated to bring it if I had one. Thank goodness I took care of that back in 2001!!! I had the same nurse the entire time, that way you do form a bond and there is a level of trust. Again, as in the initial visit, when I entered the room the Dr., although a different one, was waiting for me. He discussed everything in great detail. They took a all quiet, the Dr. reiterated what was being done and everyone had to say "check" including me. Though I thought it was strange, it leaves little room for error if we are all on the same page. All went well and this test showed normalcy! Yeah!   Then I went back again the other day. Well let's just say I couldn't not complete the test. It had nothing to do with Mayo at all, just me. My body was not cooperating. My Dr. called me within the hour to say he had been notified. He wanted to reassure me that it was OK, and we would discuss it at greater length in his office on my follow-up appointment. If I had any questions or concerns to feel free to call him at any time. Now that is a surprising change and I just loved it. Yes, I have not been feeling all too well since that day, but...

AMAZING!  This is the first time I ever got what I ordered!!!!!  140 degree grande peppermint latte!  WOWZA!  YIPPEE!  Though the staff did not seemed thrilled to be there or had any sort of personality-it didn't matter because my drink was perfect:)  FYI-this was the location outside of the B security check-point.

So...normally I don't rent DVDs and this was not the reason I went to Blockbuster. Earlier in the day I was speaking with a friend who said she had gone there as they were having a sale. Previously viewed DVDs 5/$20. Really? Wow. And they had a great selection. I am more of a chick flick fan but they had boy movies as well. They also had movies for $1.99 without the case. Sometimes it is nice to have some DVDs for travel or just to have in your back pocket for a rainy day. The staff was so friendly and helpful. What a great find! Thanks Sara:)

Zoom in... Zoom out...  If you need the pressure checked in your tires this is the best and fastest way to do it.  They have a lane dedicated to just checking your air and filling you up:)  Only problem, I forgot to have them check my spare.  Wish they would automatically do it since it is just hanging on the back door!!!

It has been so long since I have been to Crate & Barrel and I have no idea why I stayed away for so long. I was up at Kierland and saw the store and decided to pop in and check it out. I am so glad that I did. I was checking out the dog supplies and Howie got a new water and food bowl and a new toy and id tag and I got a key chain too:) OK there were other purchases made but when I was looking at the dog stuff I needed some help and it was so amazing how helpful everyone was. The girl who was helping me went to get me a basket and chatted for a few too, like it was no hassle. Then at check out it was so pleasant. When I got home it was so nice to see everything wrapped so nicely. Thanks for taking the time and effort!!!

I was in a time crunch and needed a little caffeine to start my day. Drive-thru yeah! Well, if I would have noticed the long long long line in the drive-thru I probably should have opted to go inside or bypass all together. Well, I made it to my destination on time. But a bit stressed. My iced peppermint latte was just what I needed and it was soooooo good. I am used to having Starbucks at the airport and it just never seems to taste right, so I was super happy to have it just like I like it. Thanks for the boost of energy which was needed on this particilar day:)

Great place for a girlie lunch! Had a wonderful salad and dressing on the side. The server actually remembered. She wasn't pushy or did not try to push us out fast. We had an enjoyable lunch with glasses filled promptly. Quiet at the lunch hour which was nice so we could actually have a nice conversation. Definitely a place to go back to!!!

My gripe is that when you serve imitation crab meat you MUST let people know.  Seriously, there are a lot of allergy sufferers out here and I am one and I do not like having an allergic reaction to something I should not have one to!  If you are going to serve nasty fly by night imitation food, I really can't eat there.  Sushi is sushi and it should be real and fresh.  Enough said!

I was hoping to get something close to homemade and this place yelled out my  name.  Actually my friend and I were going to go somewhere else but then I passed cracker barrel, made a phone call, and poof we changed our minds.  I just thoroughly enjoyed the sweet tea.  There is nothing like good old sweet tea on a summer afternoon-well I guess it was a cold winter's night in Arizona so whatever.  I ordered the beef noodle soup which was so good.  I am actually not feeling to well today and have thought about going to get me some soup:)  HHHHMMMMM!!!!!!  I then ordered the pork chop, it was a little dry but not bad enough not to eat it and had the baked apples and corn.  It was such a simple meal but very good.  Our waiter was Sam who was spot-on and so courteous and friendly and efficient-great!  I would certainly request him on my next visit!!!

Just so you know I am a big big fan of the Gilbert location and since I was on the other side of the freeway the other night, we decided to order a pizza, and yes it was as good as the Gilbert location. I just love that everything is soy free. The only downfall was that they do not carry the passion flavored iced tea, just regular and raspberry. I hope they change it in the future. The location is perfect and maybe because everyone was home watching the games, the place was empty. What is wrong with those Mesa people, don't they know when they have a great thing????

Ordered another pizza for take-out!  The pizza is just fabulous.  And just love the fact that they are soy free.  Makes life so easy to just order and eat:)  No worries with an allergic reaction.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  It seems that in the evenings this place is very quiet, but I am sure the lunchtime crowd is huge with its location close to Falcon Field, Boeing, and Apache Helicopter.  Great place!

This place is always so right on.  I have never had a bad experience and thought it was about time to write about it.  Just went out for a glass of wine, not great but not bad.  Believe me I have had some bad wine lately and there are so many options, just wish there were a few of my favorites on the list:)  I had the goat cheese and salsa, love it, but then I love goat cheese.  I was disappointed that they do not have the flatbreads any more but the goat cheese is simply divine.  Also had the key lime pie for dessert.  I must say it was so amazingly delicious I can't wait to have it again!  Another disappointment was that they did not have the shots of dessert.  I loved that you could order 3 different dessert tasters and get your fix all in a micro-mini!  Going back tomorrow for dinner:)

I have been wanting to try this place out for a long time and have heard great reviews.  At 130p on a Friday there was a 20 minute wait.  BUT...there was a table in the bar so we opted for that instead.  We sat down and ordered and were very excited about the atmosphere.  We ordered the ravioli for an appetizer, OMG delicious!  Superb!  Amazing!!!  We then moved on to the Italian wedding soup- Yikes- something went wrong.  The orzo looked like rice and was in clumps on the bottom of the bowl.  It was so salty I could not even eat it.  I had to return it.  There didn't seem to be a problem with that and our waitress did take it off the bill.  Oh by the way, I had to ask 3 times for more butter for the lovely flat bread and sourdough they place on the table.  Also, my friend had to ask twice for hot water for her tea.  The service was slow, forgetful, and not so friendly.  So, let's get back to the food.   I had ordered a flatbread which was basically a totinos pizza. yuck!  I had 2 corners and my friend took it home with her to take to work for lunch.  I would rather spend 99 cents for a cheap frozen pizza than eat at this place again.  Maybe a little happy hour with the ravioli- but nothing more...

I really thought drive-thrus were supposed to get you in and out fast.  Well...not so fast here.  But I did enjoy a large iced cinammon latte.  Yummers.  I ordered a few donuts to take to work.  The gal working the drive-thru must have been confused because she only charged me for my donuts, then another employee asked "didn't you order a latte?"  I said yes, so then I had to wait for my latte and pay again.  Not so fast but loved the latte!!!

Peepshow starring Holly Madison-more like Peepshow and a little of Holly. For $126 a ticket I would have thought she was really a part of the show. And, I know the title should give it away but REALLY, how many breasts can be hanging out? When they came out they said there would be some men, 4???? so the lead male singer was pretty hot! And the lead female had an incredible voice. The show-so not all that. I could not figure out the story line at all. So Holly is looking for love and then some fairy tale stories thrown in with some singing and dancing and topless women. They could have kept their tops on and it would have been better. I know it is Vegas but come on? Holly never sang or danced, she just pranced around in her robe, which almost seemed like she was very self conscious of her belly because she was always holding it. strange strange strange. not a repeat guest I will be!!!

I have never made a purchase at this particular store, but have had alterations and pressing done. Wow, these people are so nice and so kind. Their easy going atmosphere is so relaxing and they love to just chat and talk about the little things in life. I do feel special in this store. I am there about once a week for pressing of my pants which they do complimentary if they are a product of their empire!!! Love that about them! Just a great store, great location, and great employees!

Far better latte than bucks-thats for sure.  This is a place I meet my friend for coffee when she drives down from scottsdale.  we always have a wonderful drink-peppermint latte for me- and some great conversation.  Even though I live about 5 miles from It's a Grind, I do not go there just for a coffee, I guess if it was on my way to work or more conveneintly located I would because although the prices are similar to bucks it is far far better tasting and just a not so franchised look...

This is the best store for single people or people who don't cook much!  Great breads (soy free) wonderful cheese selection as they carry my favorite, Supreme Brie.  It is small and the selection is slim but they have such a great selection of fresh items.  Of course the expiration date is not long, but who wants to eat a loaf of bread that lasts a month, really it should only last a few days.  I am not into the preservatives and junk in my food.  I really like their fresh salads!!!  The store is always clean and they do give back to the community.  Save your receipts for schools and the school gets $1 for every $20 is receipts!  Great place to go every few days for the fresh items:)

What I like most about this store is pure convenience.  And it doesn't hurt that their brand does not contain high fructose corn syrup, artificial color or flavors or added trans fats.  More of our food suppliers should really take note.  It is not a place to get all of your shopping done, but then I don't think it is meant for that purpose.  What is wonderful is that everything is fresh and easy, so if you buy fresh food without preservatives you  must shop more often.  This is a great little store to hit before dinner for the last minute items, or grab a salad for work or grab some milk, eggs and juice.  I love the store:)

I hosted a charity fundraiser, Love, NORTON, at Oakville. The food was absolutely fabulous and the staff was so amazing and accommodating. BTW. Great wine! Their outdoor patio is lovely, especially with the fireplace. I just love their iced sport tea and brownies which are SOY FREE! I wished I lived closer or they had one in my neighborhood. I would be getting to-go food everyday! I have been to the Oakville in Napa as well and didn't know they were connected. Great place any time of the day! Start off the morning with a fabulous latte and chocolate croissant, and end the day with an amazing glass of wine and wonderful cheeses! Love this place!

GADZOOKS!!!  When did Starbucks come out with this larger than life cup?  And why hasn't anyone told me about it?  Great location for on and off the freeway, but then the drive-thru, which I did not use, was located right next to the patio, or the patio was located next to the drive-thru?  Whichever!  Anyway, it was not so pleasant sitting on the patio enjoying my "GINORMOUS" unsweetened passion iced tea with my friend.  Loved the tea, oh so refreshing, and loved the size!!!

Well...let's just say I needed to use a fax machine. I know, I know...Who uses faxes as they are so archaic? Well, I had to venture out to the only place I know still has them, FEDEX KINKOS!!! For $2.70 I sent 2 pages across the standby phone line. A local number at that. Really? Do you think there is a little bit of a price gouge going on here? And it is self serve so no one even assists you. Thank goodness for that because the "girls" were so busy discussing their personal lives, and far too much for me to discuss on this site, they could have cared less about the rest of the people in the small, quaint little shop. I have been to this location several times, never encountered such unprofessional behavior. Seriously I don't need to know about your baby daddy!!!!!!!!!!!!

Over the past 2 weeks I have been a frequent customer at this particular PetSmart!  I have a new puppy in my house and need lots of treats, dog food and toys!  Of course, Howie, is eating the best dog food around BLUE BUFFALO!  No soy, no gluten, and no corn and best of all no meat by products!!!!!  Yes it is pricey but why wouldn't I want Howie to eat healthy food when I eat healthy food, right?  The toy selection is OK, seriously I know a lot of people don't want to spend money on good toys, but really give me options people!!!  As for the collar and leash selection, HELP!  I have a boy dog and I am a girl-options would be great in this department as well.  Think about it, it is his outfit and he should look fabulous everyday with colors that compliment his coat!  The staff has been great and helpful with little training tricks-nice to have dog lovers work at a pet store.  I would NEVER take Howie into PetSmart as it is just a breeding ground for illness.  Geez, you never know what diseases other animals may bring in.  Not everyone vaccinates their animals or takes care of them the proper way.  Though it is nice to shop with your little 4 legger-they are better left home:)

So close and conveniently located in the San Tan Village. I love this mall because you can park right outside the store you want to shop in and not have to walk 10 miles to get to the store. Anyway, I was there last week for the panty raid sale. I seem to be going through panties-did I mention I have a puppy? Yikes, the little guy stretches them until they snap and then he is done with them. so instead of 2 leg holes and a waist hole I have 2 big holes! HAHAHA! So I figured I would go take advantage of the sale. Yeah! Great selection. They have anything from feeling sexy to being overly bloated. Butt coverage or no butt coverage. soft or a little rough! get the picture. anyway, I got a coupon in the mail for a free panty and I headed out yesterday to see what else I could snag. The sale was still on! Though they were out of my size in the free panty they had substitutions which I liked better:) Then as I was checking out I told the girl I had to come back because I had another coupon-seems the more you shop the more coupons you get!!!!!!! She asked it I had it and I did. She let me have another panty for free! WOW-great customer service. Very helpful and not too bad of a price. Now, if I could just keep my puppy away from my panties and bras. Last night he got into my bathing suits. It doesn't matter if they are brand new, clean, or dirty, he just is a clothes whore. I find he likes to rummage through the hamper the best, ugh!

Enjoyed a girls dinner out...  Our waiter, Christian, was so patient with us.  2 of us arrived and did not know if anyone else was going to show up.  Then as our food was arriving the 3rd showed up and then as we ordered dessert the 4th showed up.  What a challenge and he was so easy going with our long extended dinner.  The new location is a bit loud as the room is quite large.  As always the bread is tasty if you order a side of alfredo sauce for dipping.  The salad is always so fresh and you can get it unlimited for your meal for $8.50 but it is always such a nice starter.  This was a first for ordering a latte and it was actually very good, I was pleasantly surprised.  And the dessert, yum!  3 out of the 4 of us loved it.  We will definitely go back for another girls dinner and ask for Christian-he was fabulous!!!

What a fun evening this was... So yes, I grew up watching Donny & Marie and they are still as fun as they were back in the 70s. Though I do have to say Donny is more of a performer and crowd pleaser and teaser than Marie. Donny walked across the tables and the women just loved getting so close to to their star! Now, Marie on the other hand had her high high high shoes and barely moved and did not really play to the audience. This is a show you must see just like seeing Wayne Newton, there are certain classics that you have to see once in life, another is Elton John! Anyway, fun fun fun and a great venue-the theater is so old and eclectic and just added to the show. A must see for sure and so fun to sing along:)

YUM YUM YUMMY YUM YUM YUM!!!!!!! First of all let me say that I am highly allergic to soy so it is very difficult to find places that are soy free. I called earlier today and asked if they used soy, the young man who answered said he didn't know. I asked when someone would be available hat would know. He said within the hour. So after doing some things around the house, I ventured over and decided to hopefully treat myself to a cupcake. Such a cute little shop and easily accessible because it is on the corner of the mall so parking is easy with a short walk. I asked if there was soy in their cupcakes, they said they did not know but they could call the manager. After a few minutes they were told that everything without chocolate was soy free. So I ordered a strawberry and a celebration. Once I got in the car I could not resist any longer. I bit into the over-sized strawberry cupcake and it was delicious! The cupcake was light and the butter cream frosting was delightful, it was one of the best cupcakes I have had in forever and I love cupcakes! I will definitely be going back as it is just a hop skip and jump away from home!!!

I know...I was just there yesterday but couldn't not get the cupcakes out of my mind.  I went back and got 2 more strawberry and an orange.  Ate the strawberry as soon as I got home.  It was just the same as I remembered it yesterday!  Can't wait till I can't wait any longer and put that orange one in my mouth.  Maybe tonight!

So after the 4th visit I am still hooked.  The orange is the best!!!  I did get a cookies and cream for a friend and it received rave reviews too!!!  Seriously, I need to cut back.  Maybe I should limit myself to once or twice a week cupcake visits

WELL...they did it again!  I ordered a cookies and cream birthday cake and although I could not eat it:(  it was everything I hoped it would be.  EVERYONE, and I mean, EVERYONE raved about the cake and asked where I got it from.  It was absolutely gorgeous.  Perfect size and as I heard it was delicious!!!  I was a bit nervous because I had only ever had their cupcakes but I couldn't have been happier with the outcome.  Just an FYI-when my birthday rolls around I LOVE LOVE LOVE the orange blossom!!!

I tried to stop in last night but they close at 6p:(  But I made it there today:)  Cute little shop with homemade cupcakes.  Yes, I said homemade because they reminded me of my mother's cupcakes.  Remember growing up and coming home from school and having fresh baked cupcakes for a treat.  Exactly...  I tried the vanilla cupcake with the cotton candy frosting, I didn't even sit down and it was gone instantly.  YUM!  I cannot wait to try the vanilla/vanilla-its sitting in the box calling my name.  I am trying to ignore it, I don't know how much longer I can wait.  The flavors vary daily.  I printed out the menu and circled the flavors I want to try.  I am looking forward to the salted caramel!  Oh, and the iced tea is fresh brewed.  Delish.  I can't wait to eat what is in my bakery box and go back for more flavors.  And it was so great to meet Rachel the owner, who actually runs the store herself.  Did I tell you this is my latest and greatest find???  So close to the house...  It's Ok, I might enjoy life a little more with a few cupcakes!

Great food! Wonderful patio!! And amazing company!!! I am so glad they have only relocated because this is a treasure in a sea of junk:) The food is quite delicious and I cannot tell you how good the caprese pizza was. It is more than enough to share. Love love love the pesto base topped with fresh mozzarella and sliced tomatoes. The crust was light and fresh. Really enjoyed the citrus mint iced tea and to top off the meal I enjoyed the no bake chocolate and peanut butter cookies. soy free of course. This place is so amazing and I love the little changes they made since relocating downtown. Did I tell you I had great company for lunch? Thanks Michael!!!
