I drive by this place all the time and I never stopped cuz all the hipsters, but so glad I took a nice stroll from mi amigas casa to do so bcus this place is super. I got the eggplant parm special. The breading for the eggplant was on point but I realized I'm not a fan of soggy bread so that kills it cuz you need the sauce. Supper yummy sandy though! I also tried the Bumble Bee. It is served on a biscuit (so warm/so soft) fried chix w/a bourbon mustard sauce, mmmm bread and butter pickles and sits in honey all fancy. This is a tasty eat....although be warned the mustard saucy is a tad kicky w/the bourbon, was a suprise for me! Anyways so worth going, open late and I love eating outside picnic table style.

I love this place cuz it's right next to my house and I've never heard of a green chili tostada before and I'm mexican so that's random. I always order the same thing w/rice cuz it's cheap, easy, reliable, and tasty.   bean tostada- big yummy tostada shell and the refined beans are not lardy or watery. thank u!  Green chili tostada- not super floury tasting or fatty meats. This is something you need to eat like quickly cuz it will get soggy!  side of rice-perfectly prepared and to be honest I think rice is so hard to make.

This place is so wonderful for cocktailsssss, it's so dangerously good. My favorite place to go in Phx for tasty beverages but it's expensive so I gotta watchale. The owner is lightweight a jerk though. I always sit at the bar and drink and never have been inside to eat. The drink menu changes w/solstice and thy are so yummy! This time I got the Bourbon Masquerade so sarsaparillayyy & cherrish and I luv it. My homegirl had the Tongue & Groove, oh my goodness, shut it down or turn It up, "whatever blows ur hair back" type of good. She did say though she probly wouldn't get another cuz the balsamic sits in ur stomach. We also got  a yummy app some smoked marlin dish. Totally not what you imagine but none the less tasty however last time we got the salted mackerel app and that is way better. Either way hands down n√∫mero uno spot on my place for beverages

This place is the most amazing place on earth. This is for sure apart of every trip I take to Vegas. It's refreshing to go into a restaurant and see a variety of folx. Often places that are super good have a particular clientele but this place has all genres. The plantation sweet tea w/pineapple and mint is the most flavorful beverage and I've tried to duplicate it at home and it's not the same. The best thing here is the oxtail fries. It's Spicey and sweet and yummy in my tummy fries w/egg and oxtail so who doesn't want that. In terms of a meal I get the non ground beef items bcus I feel some sort of way abt it but the first time I came I got the pork belly buns and they were a nice surprise. The pork is crispy and I actually like the mixture of varieties of crunch and softness. However this time I got  the Lonely Bird which was perfect. This thing seriously has a nice bun and all the flavors jus taste nice in my mouth. Anyways my friends had the Banh Mi and Mr Ho's which of course are delissshhhh. My advice go of the strip and eat and explore but clearly you are if your reading this review.

This place is not the buizness. I got tacos which I can't believe were $7. Whathehell we live in AZ tacos are like cactus here......everywhere!!!!!!! So as I'm sitting there surrounded by hella white ppl I'm thinking why am I here. My niece didn't even like her chicken tacos, how does a kid not like tacos. That was a wrap for me but my friend keeps telling me it's not the tacos it's the enchiladas. I don't know if I can do it again. Buena suerte?

I like this spot, super chill, tons of beer choices. I didn't try the cheese plate or the grilled cheese cuz I jus ate but I really want too. we tried the Big A Double A beer  it was citrusy and crisp....me likey and I'm not a huge IPA fan but it didn't taste all marijuanayyyyy. I love the free brownie Yelp check in good promotion and its bomblicious, hope it goes all to my booty... bam! . I frikn love peanut butter, thanks for the hook up. yah likes all day oh and I learned how to play Mancala and I rule and they play Gnarls Barkley, pink Floyd, & Smashing Pumpkins so I'm in anytime I need to get away from the downtown scenesters or newly college kids. yucks!!!

mother brunch for sun night football is so nice cuz there is enough people but not hella and it's an older downtown crowd like 30/40's which is tight & it's in my hood. I've been here a bunch and me likes it.  I tried the "big ass" old fashioned instead of beer and it is a #tastybeverage, a lil too much ice but whatever cuz than I don't gotta buy another! and my homie had the "gotta catch a flight tonight beer taster. (those arnt the name but they sound better)  starters; bacon popcorn cuz I like snacks and it was a nice treat and they don't skimp on the bacon. wish they would add a lil maple drizzle to give it a tad sweatiness flavor but it's not my restaurant.   dinner; smoked wings. such a light perfect smoked & my frnd jus straight up said he liked them their not juicy but flavorful. I got both sauces on the side and I don't know if that affects things but yucky yucky yuck! the wings were so good but the sauces killed it. won't get those again! couldn't tell the diff between the MB and the habanero BBQ sauce but the crispness of them was perfect. oh and they forgot to bring one of them at first.   I also had the pear, blue cheese, argugala salad w candied walnuts w/a perfect amount of all ingredients and a lovely champagne ving that's not too vinergy. my favorite.  my friend got the sliders trio and liked the idea of getting to know the burger menu for the future.   so thank u mother brunch for being a trusty spot.
