I highly recommend Ultra Collision!  They were extremely helpful throughout the entire process (repairs after an accident where the other person wanted to avoid going though insurance companies) and always looking out for my best interest. I felt like they were fair and honest with the estimate and came highly recommended from the auto mechanic who works on all our vehicles (and is also awesome).  They did an great job on my repairs and my truck was spotless inside and out when we picked it up. (That felt like a huge luxury considering I have two young kids and my truck is rarely ever spotless!).

You get what you pay for. I may as well have let my kids paint my toenails. Not to mention the tech was rough and cut/pinched several of my toes during my pedicure.   Not impressed. I definitely won't be back.

I wish I'd come here and read the reviews before scheduling my appt for an annual with Dr. O'Sullivan. I'd had a bad experience with Dr. Nelson with the delivery of my daughter in 2009 (Considering him to manage your pregnancy? Don't do it. He's dangerously incompetent.) Due to my not wanting to see Dr. Neslon, I decided to schedule with Dr. O'Sullivan. Big mistake. She is bitter, angry and *unbelievably* unprofessional. This woman is a poor representation of the medical community. She started off by noticing that I'm starting a topical progesterone supplement this month. And so she asked me who had prescribed it, and I told her it was my physician who manages my thyroid condition. She asked me right away if it was a "Naturopath, or something like that?" & I informed her that, it was an MD, Integrative Medicine who had prescribed it for me. She then goes on to ask me what am I trying to achieve. Umm...  I told her hormone balance. Duh! WTH do you think I'm trying to achieve? I explained that we had tested my levels and my progesterone level was low. She proceeded to ask me what my symptoms were. Basically, I felt like she was grilling me as to why I would be supplementing with progesterone. Aside from the fact that my freaking blood tests showed it was low? She then goes on to say "Well, the only proven benefit to supplementing with progesterone is sleep. It's not going to help with weight loss, or anything like that. Generally speaking, if you're still getting your cycle then you are fine, and I would not recommend supplementing with progesterone. But hey, sleep is important too, so that's okay." I'm sorry, but #1 I never mentioned weight loss (I'm already at a healthy weight) and #2 I'm pretty sure that progesterone supplementation is proven to correct a low progesterone level. How about that benefit? So then she is asking about other things and I mentioned that I'm in the early stages of a separation/divorce. She then tells me how she thinks happy marriages rarely exist, and how she knows maybe 2 happy marriages out of all the married friends she has. Well, that's uplifting. Thanks, Doc. So a little later in the conversation she goes on to say how awful the dating scene is today, and that "It's really disgusting out there. These women think they're okay since they've been married/only with one person for all these years, so they go and have sex with some guy whose slept with 300+ women while you've (she's) been married all those years. And they end up with herpes." And then she follows that lovely story by telling me "The only people who are dumber than my teenagers are the 40-something divorced women." I'm pretty much in shock at this point. So she goes on to say "... So just be sure and protect yourself and use a condom when you're out there sowing your wild oats". I could not believe my ears. My family life is falling apart, the last thing I'm worried about right now is "sowing my wild oats", and even of I were... what a $&*# stupid and wildly unprofessional thing to say to a patient, or anyone, for that matter. I think she's the most unprofessional physician I've ever encountered. Needless to say, I'll be finding a new OB.

The concept of this place is great, but it's really kind of a dump... and WAY overpriced.  The lady today told me that "it is easier to cut when it's clean" (because he was a little sweaty), but failed to mention that she would be tacking an extra $3 for an already overpriced $16 haircut.  What a rip off.  Not to mention, the store is dirty.   My kids love coming here, but sadly this is our last time.

Just took my 2 yr old daughter this morning for her very first dance class. Everyone was super friendly and accommodating (bringing out tap shoes for us to try since it was our first visit) and my daughter had a blast!  We're both excited to go back next week. ;)

I've had such anxiety over dental work that it kept me from the dentist for over 5 years.  Not surprisingly that led to needing significant work done (and more still to come).  Everyone in the office was very understanding and really helped to calm my nerves and made it a completely pain free experience.  I feel like I can finally get past my anxiety now, knowing that I'm in such good hands.  I would highly recommend this practice to anyone, especially those with anxiety over dental work.  They are fantastic!!

I just went to see Emily Claire this past week.  I've been struggling with my color lately and with getting a good cut for my naturally wavy/curly hair.  She was very knowledgeable and super friendly/easy going.  The salon is clean and well maintained and the prices are great!  I'm so happy to finally have found a salon/stylist that offers top notch service at a reasonable price.  I'm very pleased with my color (and our maintenance plan) and I can say that Emily Claire gave me the best haircut I've had since I've been living here in Phoenix (almost 5 years now, and all the while going to very high end salons).

I am not a client at this salon, but called to ask them if they carried a particular type of product.  Nicole was amazingly helpful!  They did nopt carry the product I was looking for, but she went through a full list of products that she uses/has used that I might want to try, and even googled the product I was trying to find to help me locate a local salon that might carry it.  She most certainly went above and beyond and her help was greatly appreciated.

The staff is nice, but the wait times are *ridiculous*. I just spent over an hour waiting with my 4 & 6 year old kids (not fun) at 2:00 on a Wednesday afternoon for a simple x-ray.

If you have the option, go to a Jamba Juice instead. They were out of large cups when we arrived (solution being they would give you two small cups), then my daughter (6) ordered a new flavor and when she tried it she didn't like it. When I took it back to the counter asking if we coukd exchange it for a different flavor, he gave me the pained look on his face, sucked air through his teeth, tilted his head and said "Hmm, that's tough. Hmmm. Well, I'll do this one time." Umm, okay. Thanks for the "favor". Jamba Juice always says "Oh, don't worry, if you don't like it we can just make you a different flavor". We will not be back.
