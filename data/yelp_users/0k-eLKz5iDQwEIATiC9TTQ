It has literally taking me almost 2  or 3 years to write this but I figure as I am preparing for my daughter's 8 year old birthday , it is time for me to express this.  I WILL NEVER recommend this place to a friend.  When I went to inquire about the options I had for her birthday, I was treated not well at all.  I felt that the woman behind the counter was bothered by my questions, I should have taken this a hint for my future results there but I did not.  The party came and I was so excited and it was the worst bidthday party even and yet the most expensive of all, horrible!!!! One of the hostess made one of the guests cried to the point that they ended up leaving earlier.   The moms that came not even water were offered, over all, I have zero memories of something good happening.  Any ways, as my party ended and everybody left.  I came to the counter, to ask for the owner's email address and the older lady behind the counter proceeded to skip my question and an email was given to me but at this point I did not trust that I was getting a good email, and yes, she still had the courage to ask me, how my party was??????  I was in tears, and a friend  of mine had to talk for me.  Sad experience :(

My aunt and cousin were visiting me.  They came from Costa Rica and they wanted to get some girls costumes.  I got Sidney to help me with my request.  However, as she brought couple of costumes, we actually needed to open the bags to triple check our purchase and it is then when we realized that one of those costumes was incomplete, so we asked her for another one and also was incomplete, that is when Gaby another manager decided to get involved and pretty much told us that if it was a new bag everything should be there.  Seriously!!!!  My relatives spoke very little english but granted they knew that we were being treated poorly.  I defended myself against this young and rude individual and I told her that the costume was incomplete and she was welcome to look through our bags and after that she pretty much ignored me.  Essentially, we were told in our faces that we probably steal it.  Please do Party City Executives, you know that some of your products are overpriced and we, normal people decide to go to your store with all the excitement that preparing events will bring.  Someone with authority should talk to this "Gaby" person and let her know that the color of the skin (we are hispanics) does not mean anything, she needs to provide good customer service.  I actually do not send comments about my purchasing experience but I am so upset about this one that I need someone to coach her and teach her after all she is young, not a baby but young.  I am giving one star just because the other manager, Sidney was trying to help me despite the mean comments that Gaby was saying to us.  She was trying to get our attention from the mean situation that we were dealing with.  Will I tell my friends about this store absolutely!!!  Will, I consider go back there, absolutely!!!!  I will go back there if it is the only option I have.  Party City Executives you should hire enthusiastic people, creative people, people that want to actually work and work there, it is a "party planner type of store".   Thanks

I came in for the first time and I was welcomed with smiles from the friendly staff.  Krystal Baker was super sweet with me and took the time to translate the idea I had into plants.  I will be recomending this place to my friends.

Great restaurant, good food, great homemade coconut ice cream.  Our lunch was super!  The staff was great, the place is clean.  They give you 10% discount if you pay with cash.
