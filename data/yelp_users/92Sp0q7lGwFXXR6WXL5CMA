Worst customer service ever. They don't answer much less return calls. They are fine over charging or adding products to my account but when I need help they are no where to be found.

Hands down a very well bad ass place to go to. I know both owners and they are wonderful individuals. Add to that the game room in back where me and my sister can sit back grab some coffee and play some xbox. Love Gotham City!

This is hands down the most dishonest thieving operation I have ever encountered. My first visit the receptionist commented in surprise that I had good insurance. Took my family for a check up. Did the basic work. My wife went in later for a route canal. They quoted her a price on the phone then quoted her $2,000 out of pocket once she was in the chair. Then when she left in tears and still in pain they maxed out our insurance so that anywhere else we went would be out of pocket. Then proceeded to send us a $500 bill for the "check-up". Please beware and be careful. They have tried to rob us and damage our credit with fictitious charges which we have fought and gotten cleared. This is an extremely emotional statement but I hate them for trying a. to steal from me and b. leaving my wife in pain because we weren't stupid.

Awesome the best Bloody Mary w/ bacon I might add. A bit pricy but the service made it worth it.
