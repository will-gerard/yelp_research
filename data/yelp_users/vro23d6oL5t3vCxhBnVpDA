Hubby took me to Pittsburgh for a surprise date night to watch the Cardinals against the Pirates.  He booked this hotel which you can see from the stadium as well as you can see the stadium from your room if you get a good one.    We parked for 7$ across from the hotel in a self park garage. When we checked in, the front desk blonde lady was so nice and efficient. She even walked us to the elevator and handed me the room key cards because we said it was our first time in this particular renaissance.    We were in room 720 and had a great view of the ballpark from the one window in the room.  Room was very small and the bed was a queen but it was perfectly cozy and nicely appointed.  Refrigerator, coffee machine, small seating chair and bathroom had bathtub.    The walls are super thin though as we heard the kids jumping on the beds and playing in the room across the hall.  We had to call down to the front desk to complain and about 4 minutes later, we could hear someone knocking on their room door to ask them to keep the noise level down.  Very efficient.  The lobby is gorgeous, there is a great little restaurant inside and you are caddy corner from the ballpark. Just cross the bridge. Perfect location, great Staff, I'd stay here again anytime!

Watched a movie next door at the AMC and we had a little time to grab some food. Didn't want a full sit down restaurant as we had eaten at RA Sushi the night before. Our options were pizza, rubios or asian.  Grabbed a takeout menu and saw they had vietnamese, thai chinese, a little Japanese and korean. Clearly you can't be great at all of these flavors but we decided to order.  Walked up to the counter where we were greeted by a nice young gentleman named Mike apparently. Very good with customer service and asking questions as well as answering some of mine. Got pad thai with chicken and no peanuts with a side of kimchi. Hubby ordered shrimp pad thai. We used our check in offer for free crab rangoon.  Sat down and Mike brought our appetizer and kimchi first. Offered me chopsticks which I appreciated. Kimchi was fresh and very korean. Crab rangoon decent. Pad thai were great with lots of chicken and shrimp and flavorful cooked tofu.  Mike came by offering samples of Vietnamese coffee. Nice touch and tasted great. Pretty much full service except you order upfront. Nice comfy booths and tables with a couple tvs and outside seating.  We will be back!

Searched for Pho from Downtown Phoenix and actually found a different spot. Checked the hours and drove over to find out that they were closed! Searched again and found Da Vang was only 3 more minutes away. In a little shady section of town but dont be afraid!!!  Located in a strip plaza, plenty of parking.  Everyone is friendly...most speak enough english. The Pho is Pho-nomenal!!! Super yummy broth, very authentic. Regular or large sizes and so much variety to pick from.  The pricing is just ridiculously cheap. $4.75 for an amazing bowl of Pho Tai!  Spring and Summer Rolls are very fresh and come with lettuce and dipping sauces.  Less than $3.50 each.   The best surprise are the Banh Mi Sandwiches for $3 a piece.  I always take one home to eat later cause I cant finish everything I order while I'm there.  The food is great, atmosphere is ...well...authentically vietnamese and they do have a working bathroom lol.  Great meal and friendly staff with the cheapest prices.  Been back about 4 times.  You cant go wrong with your order!

I'm not Diamondbacks fan just to be clear. We live right up the road and take the light rail down to the front door of the stadium.  Very clean and user friendly stadium. Very different experience when the roof is open compared to not.  It can seem gloomy if it is closed.  Surprised they would ever close it.  Love the food selection. Right at the entrance is the taste of Chase where they have ginormous corndog, hotdogs and fried sandwiches.  Anything and everything unhealthy.  Just to the left a little further is a place that sells $5 corn in the cob with toppings. Also they have tamales and you can get a great meal for 10 bucks.  The swimming pool suite seats is on my list of fun stuff to do. Need to find out the pricing.  It's sad that the stadium is never full. Good fun and great stadium!

Had such high expectations as its just blocks from our condo In a big plaza with starbucks so plenty of parking. Outdoor patio and inside seats as well.  Got here on a Saturday afternoon at 2 pm. They gave us the lunch special menu. Very good pricing.  Tofu, chicken, beef or pork dishes are $7.95 and shrimp dishes are $9.95.  Salad comes with each order and the dressing is good.  Apparently so good that people want to buy it so it's on their menu as a side for $5?  Other sides included hot sauce and different sauces. No actual sides like Tom yum soup or chicken satay or papaya salad.  I did notice they have those on their dinner menu but we weren't given that menu.  It's nice they have Saturday lunch special till 3pm but I guess I found the menu limited.  Food was Bland so the pepper and hot sauce tray came in handy.  The thai basil signature dish is Rice and saut√©ed vegetables. Hubby got it with shrimp but didn't enjoy it.  My red curry which I was so excited about was runny and not enough flavor. She didn't ask if we wanted hot, thai hot or medium hot and I forgot to say so I guess we just got regular?  I think this is a swing and a miss.  Might try once more for dinner and get their pad thai and papaya salad. That's how I usually judge a thai restaurant.  The server barely spoke to us...maybe lack of English. Just blah.

So I am not sure where to start about this place. Have eaten here once but had a bad experience twice.  There was one night a month ago where I yelped for a pho restaurant near me and came across this place. We were 17 minutes away so we drove over and it was closed with no sign or excuse.  It was a normal business night an hour and half before closing.  I was happy they were closed cause I went to the next place we found on Yelp. DA VANG which is maybe 3 minutes away. We loved Da Vang as the food was so good and authentic as well as cheap. It was a blessing.  I had picked this place only cause it had more reviews. Many which I found said go to Da Vang.  We have gone to their competitor 5 times at least and went on Wednesday when they were closed by accident. Yelp does have them as closed. So, we tried here.  This is bigger and probably a similar menu...it's pho and Vietnamese after all.  I ordered the crispy spring rolls and hubby the summer rolls with pork and shrimp. Neither were great. My crispy ones were soggy and they gave me one piece of lettuce for the 2 rolls. I had regular pho Tai and the meat was rubbery. The noodles were clumped together and they gave such little bean sprouts. My hubby had the phone with filet and I watched him spit out all the fatty meat pieces into his napkin.  No one spoke to us and I don't think they really speak English. We had to walk up to get the check. We won't come back even on Wednesdays when da Vang is closed.

I was desperate on a Sunday to get a gel mani before traveling early Monday morning. Searched for nail salons around my home open on Sunday. Found this and was a little hesitant when I saw the photos of the exterior. But...I called to schedule an appt. Well, they DON'T take appointments according to the man who answered. Ok...will still try. Went there at 120 and they were packed. He said it would be 40 minutes.   I came back in 25 and waited about 15 minutes.  Small hole in the wall. Signs everywhere saying $2 charge for credit or debit card use. $15 if you break a Polish. Watch your kids and they can't sit in your lap whole you're getting a mani or pedi.  Pretty sure the owner took off my gel nails and she did great really quick. Then she passed me to another younger girl who did the Polish and design.  Broken English, upsells everyone like it's their business and it's totally not glamorous. Not even nice. So why the 4 stars? My nails look fab and it was quick once they got started. I appreciate a business that puts up all the rules on their walls lol. $34 for gel nails with a design. Of course I had to pay the $2 for credit card use and $7 dollar tip which they were very thankful for.   1.5 miles from my house and open sundays. I will take it!

If anyone follows me on Yelp, I visit a lot of TJ Maxx locations on my travels. I am a huge fan of theirs as I can almost always find the name brands that I like. Ralph Lauren, Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Lucky Brand, Big Starr etc. I can even find my Paris Hilton perfume here and other knick knacks.  Been to this location about 3 or 4 times. Last Sunday, we even bought an office leather chair here. Loved the design but when I sat in it at home for a couple hours, it wasn't as comfortable as I wanted.  Hubby had thrown the receipt away and the tag they had stapled to the receipt.  We took it back today and didn't know if they would take it back.  The front desk girl called the manager and the manager offered to look at the register from 5 days ago. They found the ticket and really went the extra mile to help us out and refund us. We shop every weekend and I definitely needed to write a review about stellar extra miling on customer service. Thank you!!!  Ps...the store is great too. Lots of selection and great staff overall.

Not impressed. Sat at the bar to wait for the rest of the gang to show up for the Dodgers vs diamondbacks game. 2 drinks and a quesadilla appetizer ended up 25 bucks. Bartender l female was not very welcoming or nice. It was busy so just really trying to churn the crowd it seemed. Bbq quesadilla was dry but came with salsa.  Probably better to just sit outside and grab your own beer from the little tent.  Glad we didn't grab a full table and have a meal. It is convenient that it's on property of the stadium bit that's about it.

Yelped for best brunches in phoenix and picked The Henry. Specialty coffees and a tables idea bloody mary cart? Duh, of course! Crossed my fingers that we could get in as I needed a reservation for the next day which was my birthday on a Sunday at 11. Open table let me book 6 and then I had to call the restaurant to add 2 more which they accommodated at 1115.  Pulled in after Church at about 1050. Reservations were for 1115.  Adorable spot with beautiful decor. Parking is full so drive through to the back but it's free.  We waited outside and got seated at 1125 at a round table on the patio. Adorable. Not too hot and we were mostly covered.  Our server, Sara was a delight. Very enthusiastic and she knew it was my birthday. So sweet and helpful.   One of our guys said to surprise him with a drink. It was funny because they forgot it and she joked with us that it was the surprise. The coffees were delish and most also had a brunch cocktail. We were informed that the bloody mary cart can't come outside up the stairs but I ordered a virgin spicy bloody and it didn't come halfway through my meal. When one of my friends told Sara, she apologized and got right on it. The lady came up and brought it at no charge. And the surprise drink for my friend that they didn't bring cause it had no protein powder was also on the house. Very nice.  They did bring an extra order of French toast by accident and said to enjoy it. All the food deliverers kind of mixed up the plates as they sat them down.  You should have seen my hubby's face when they tried to give him am omelette that looked healthy cause he ordered the carrot cake pancakes. All in all, the food was good and even though so many little things went wrong...the service thanks to Sara was really great.  Appreciate her putting up with us and even bringing me bread pudding dessert as a present.  Beautiful posh interior and high quality everything. I'm glad I got to treat my friends to a nice brunch and we could see camelback pretty much Birdseye view across the street.  We went home and changed and climbed it!   Great  birthday brunch.

Park in the parking structure right before you get here. $3 for an hour.  Adorable little restaurant with patio seating. Servers and host are super friendly.   Apparently known for their pancakes and they have pancakes of the day. We came in on a Monday around 11 am and we're seated instantly. Server was honest about her favorites. We had the mmm mmm mimosa and a spicy bloody mary.  I ordered some healthier eggs Benedict with broccolini and pesto Rice and the hollandaise sauce is some kind of cream cheese yummy heavy sauce.  They have funny names for the dishes but I can't remember them all. My friend had a lighter breakfast and both were great. Server brought out hot sauce for me and the food came out quick.  Very trendy and fun place close to the university.  Definitely see why they are popular. Great breakfast or brunch spot.

Glad this location was open as the day before, we tried to go to the tempe location at 6 pm and it was closed even though yelp says they stay open. Greeted by the girl behind the counter right away and she asked if we had been there before. When we said no, she gave us the run down of how it all worked. It was happy hour so 3 donuts for 5 dollars. We tried to get 9 and use our check in free oc sand donut and then we're told getting a dozen would be a better deal. Why not? We got blueberry, lemonade, oc sand, bacon bomb, eclair, Apple pie, margarita, salted caramel, Dulce de Leche, and forgot the rest. Warm donuts made in front of you. Takes about 10 minutes to get the donuts so be patient. Good flavor and like the crisp on the outside of the donuts. 19$ for 13 donuts and one milk.  Interesting story about the name... Donuts are good and I'm sure kids live the pick your flavors or make what you want.  Satisfied our sweet tooth. This location is right by the coyotes arena in the fun little shopping district. Street parking or parking lot at either end.

I've visited at least a dozen Amazing Lashes (Dallas, Austin, Atlanta, Orange County, Houston) and by far Amazing Lashes Tempe Marketplace is my favorite location!  This is my second visit here for refill and I'm thrilled that it can be my home location now.    Today, Isabel did my refill and they look beautiful.  I judge the locations on customer service when booking, being greeted well, promptness and cleanliness.   I believe the stylists get trained properly and if your Lashes fall out sometimes sooner than other visits, you can't just blame them.  How you take care of the Lashes is important too.  Both times I've been in, Ashley has been there and was super prompt and helpful. Yesterday I had walked in to set my appt for today while I was shopping.  Bailee was so friendly, even went out of her way to wish me a happy birthday. She was here today with Ashley and they light up the front desk with their smiles and great customer service.  A+ ladies!!!   This location is in the District of Tempe Marketplace and is across from H&M. Don't go anywhere else. Their pricing is great...I love my membership and I think they've done an amazing job at dominating eyelash services for the ladies!!!

Love Lou Malnatis pizza in Chicago as the crust and sauce are to die for. Always been my favorite pizzeria. Was so excited to have this one open here in Phoenix just 10 minutes from my home.  Got there at 520 and of course there was a line. However, you could sit outside right away and outside patio is adorable. Mist fans and covered seating. It was 104 degrees but so didn't feel like it.  Omg...try the Buffalo chicken, watermelon salad with balsamic vinaigrette and gorgon zola if you like Bleu cheese.  Order your own for $8?95 or family portion for $12.95. Sounds a little unusual but it was so good.  Combination fried appetizer plate is just standard. Comes with Ranch and salsa.  The pizzas...the classic is the best as they put the toppings under the sauce and the butter crust is just simply fantastic.  The Lou is no sauce but has vine ripened tomatoes that are juicy to make up for that. Spinach and mushroom. You can half the pizzas to try different toppings. Large pizzas are about $23.95 per and have 8 slices. Pizzas can take 35 to 40 minutes each so order appetizers.  Plenty of parking in the shake shack/aj market shopping center.

Disclaimer: I'm Korean and my hubby is not. Pretty sure I know authentic korean food. Saw this as a hot new restaurant on yelp and had to try it out as my first korean food experience in Arizona. Saw a picture that a fellow yelper had posted showing they had Poke bowls as a special. Hubby loves poke bowls and not so much love for korean food. We drove over and when we walked in, we were greeted by a smiling young server named Eric. Nice guy who sat us and even apologized that they were out of diet Pepsi and offered diet coke which was fine for hubby. I ordered the kimchee stew with pork belly which is my all time favorite comfort food dish. Hubby found out that they didn't have poke bowls today so Eric and I convinced him that the spicy chirashi bowl would be a great substitution.  Found out Eric was Chinese and not korean.  When my pot came out, I realized it was soon tofu soup with kimchee instead of kimchee stew. I had ordered it by the korean name and he didn't understand it. He took it back right away and apologized. A nice lady came out and also apologized for the mix up. I felt bad but I'm not a fan of tofu soup. I was apologizing for not being clearer in my ordering. Hubby's chirashi came out and it was great with flavor and lots of fish. There were 8 banchan dishes of tempura, cucumber kimchee, kimchee, salty fish, broccoli, zucchini and a couple others. Nice variety but I love when they have egg and potatoes and dark on kimchee.  My kimchee stew came out and it was wonderful. Huge restaurant that's very clean, has tvs and a peekaboo kitchen. Huge bar offering which Koreans love. Great menu that has a bit of everything. Good pricing. Kimchee stew: $9.99 Spicy chirashi: $12.99  Thanks for great customer service and good clean food. Hoping someone ate that kimchee tofu the! I will be back!

I see them popping up everywhere and had to try as I've heard some hype. Walked in and liked the atmosphere. the menu looked fun but I couldn't find a special burger? I got the hamburger with shack sauce? Peanut Butter shake and crinkle fries. My hubby got some bacon double double and a shake. No special condiments, just ketchup and mustard and a Louisiana hot sauce on the condiment bar.  When our buzzer buzzed and we got our tray, I didn't see anything special. The shakes were small and 5.29 for one? My hubby's double double was almost 10$.  I pay for good food but I really didn't get anything good here. Just a scrawny hamburger  (I'm sure the meat is better than other places) and the fries tasted like ore Ida fries you made as a kid at home. Peanut Butter shake was good as the girl told me it has custard in it. They do sell alcohol here and have sports playing on the tvs. Nice atmosphere and concept but not worth the 30$ we paid for 2 hamburgers, fries and small shakes. Disappointed.
