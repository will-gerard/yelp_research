I scheduled an appointment and no one showed up within the timeframe they gave me. I called the office and no one answered. I called again and the guy that answered said he was finishing a job and could be there in 10 minutes. No sorry and no explanation as to why he's late. I asked him to charge me regular rate since he's late and he said no. I am appalled!   The company should have called me in advance to tell me they were running late. They also should have done something to make it right for being late. Horrible customer service!

The flowers were stunning! I provided some photos of what I liked and she nailed it! The price was right and she used high quality materials. I loved all the bouquets and boutonni√®res! I highly recommend her.

Awesome place for a bachelorette girls pedi. It's a BYOB so we all had mimosas while getting our pedicures. I highly recommend!

Based on the high reviews we stopped by for a quick bite. It's a small little shop with friendly staff. We tried the Chile Verde burrito, RCB burrito and Chile Relleno burrito. We liked the Chile Verde and the other two is no bueno. I will definitely come back again to try their breakfast burritos.
