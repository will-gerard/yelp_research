Great office! I have never felt like they try and over-sell me on work I don't need. The dental hygienists are always very friendly, and quick. Also, I never get lectured for not doing anything at home, instead they provide a positive approach to help you with flossing and proper brushing.

I really didn't enjoy my experience. I felt (from a beginner level) that the routes were poorly planned and the space was poorly utilized with random holds, unmarked. I only bouldered and most of the gym was top ropes so maybe I got a bad taste in my mouth, but I'll shop around before getting a membership.

Excellent!!! $5 even, no gimmick. You drive through and it gets most of those hard to reach places. Not quite a hand wash but comparable. The best part... The vacuums are free. (((bring a towel to wipe the spots off your exterior))) they give you a moist towelette thing to wipe the dust off your interior

We had loads of fun being transported to the concert by The Trolley Llama! Arell and Alexis are great hosts, and provide a unique experience for any party ;-)
