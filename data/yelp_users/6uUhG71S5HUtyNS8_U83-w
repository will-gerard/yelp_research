Really good sausage pot pie, the potatoes were so good.  It was huge - so bring your appetite or a doggie bag.

Excellent - she looks great, she sounds great and she knows how to put on a show.  She is not afraid to mingle with the audience which is nice.  We really enjoyed it so much and were sad when it ended.  I am so glad she is doing shows again - Yay Shania.

Just ok - I think I had higher expectations.

We came into BWW and were told it would be a 45 minute wait for a party of 3.  So we decided to order take-out.  There were 7 open tables in the area of the restaurant where the take-out bar is, so we sat at one while we waited.  The hostess actually came and asked us to get up and stand at the bar.  If it was anywhere near packed, I would understand, but really, 7 open tables!!  They actually go out of their way to be rude here!  Too bad we already paid, or I would leave.
