Oh for the love of God this place is boring. Pottery and pictures of pottery.   I came here for some tour a few years ago. I was so bored I went outside and took a nap next to giant flower pot. Then I came back here last month for a charity event and also took a nap, this time in the bathroom.  Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...

I'm not sure why I love this IHOP so much. Maybe it's because I can order pancakes, a cheese omlette, cheesy-hash browns with bell peppers, bacon and toast and  it all tastes so damn good and is relatively cheap... although I just realized our waitress overcharged me by A LOT this morning. Grr.  Pretty solid experiences all around here. Go IHOP!

Sometimes I think that people are willing to let ANYTHING slide in order to avoid chain restaurants. That is why Fate is so successful.  Fate has the rudest staff and worst "wait" policy of any restaurant in town. The worst part? They make no apology for making you wait OUTSIDE for a table in 110 degree weather. Are they on crack? Outside??? The whole bar is empty...yet patrons are relegated to the hot dirty front yard. Why do you make people wait outside when you are empty?  One time I went there and only TWO tables were occupied. They told us there would be a 20 - 30 minute wait. I asked why there is a wait as nearly ALL the tables were open. The dumb girl at the door kind of shrugged and said they weren't enough waiters. So there aren't enough waiters to handle THREE tables instead of two???  At least let us wait INSIDE.   Despite the place being empty the mean lady told us to wait outside. I said NO THANKS. and stormed off NEVER to return.   FATE IS MY WORST DINING EXPERIENCE IN ARIZONA SO FAR.  Fate is less than 1 mile from my house, so it saddens me it isn't a place I can call home.

I sure like listening to Shappy on "The Dave Pratt in the Morning Show" on KMLE. I hated country but now I'm starting to like some country artists. So thank you KMLE.

Words cannot express my love for La Tolteca. Well, not English words and I no habla Espanol. But I'll try...  SUPER NACHOS MOTHERFUCKER!!!  Nacho cheese, tons of cilantro, chicken, beef, beans, onions, tomatos, salsa, more cheese piled into a HUGE box. A huge box!  ............................................................................... THUD  I just passed out.  Also great everything else. and cheap as hell. Like pesos cheap.  !ah dios mio!

Gentrification be damed, this place is still (barely) standing.   First off let me warn you that the salsa that comes with the chips is HOT. Not just a little spicy - like 5 alarm rip your own tongue out hot.  That aside, the food here is really good. I usually order 3 rolled chicken tacos with gaucamole or the cheese enchiladas. They never get it wrong. Everything on the menu is cheap, fast and damn good. They are also speedy with the drink refills which always rocks.  Also, you can actually catch a bus to Jaurez from their parking lot as the local scary bus to Mexico departs from the depot next door. That is pretty hot too.

Last night I made a totally bad ass salad here at the salad bar. It had great things in it like chick peas and hot peppers and nuts. It totally rocked and made my night.  Other good things about AJ's:  The beer case. I'm a beer drinking chick and I always find something new and interesting to try.  The cheese case. Despite my lactose intolerance I LURVE cheeses of all kinds. AJ's does not disappoint.  If you need to pick up flowers it is very easy and convenient to create your own arrangement here. This is good to know for special occasions, parties...etc. (HINT HINT: Buy me flowers!!!) I also like to buy a fresh single stem or two and whip up a simple yet funky piece for the nightstand or dinner table. It just looks so fresh and chic and smells nice.

The biggest challenge here is getting your hands on a drink menu. IF, and I mean IF, you are able to obtain one of the elusive drink menus you are in for a treat.  George and Dragon is really different than other local bars and pubs. It's owned by a true Brit with a real cockney accent and run by a bunch of tatted up punk rock looking girls. The contrast of the football flags and the Camden town style of the wait staff makes the atmosphere interesting.   There is a good crowd at the bar. Except for the usual few a-holes you find in every bar, The G & D is patronized by hipsters and business men alike. Families eating bangers and mash sit seats away from rowdy college kids. Stock brokers drink ale next to drunkards slamming whiskey and stylish career gals drinking cosmos. It's a unique mix rarely found in Arizona.  The food is pretty good too. English food is by definition terrible. I lived in Cambridge for a few months and found it hard to digest most traditional English fare, but G & D does a good mix of American classics and British favorites. Even the cold egg thing that my boyfriend loves (and I hate) seems to be a hit with most patrons.  George and Dragon is a great place to meet with friends, have happy hour with co-workers or sit alone and stew. Either way you should have a good time in this gem of a pub.   Don't forget to try the fried pickles!

Heidi, the service advisor is pretty much all they have going for them. She is on the ball!  Other than that, Camelback VW is as sleazy as they come.   The finance department LIED and LIED to me and my family about the terms of our contract and what we were signing. Packy (that's his name) mislead me about the terms of my contract, then OUTRIGHT LIED about whose name was on the note. Packy then coerced us into signing a contract that was NOT at all what he said was. He lied time and time again, used intimidation and insults and basically screwed me over in a way that I can hardly believe.  I need to contact the Better Business Bureau, but this has been going on for 3 years now. I wonder if it is past the statute of limitations?  STAY AWAY.

The Fish Market is a strange place. It's not super high end, but not cheap. It's not elegant, but it isn't tacky. The food isn't amazing, but it tastes very good.    But for some reason this is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. It's just very satisfying. Maybe these are some of the reasons I like it so much:  - Impeccable service. Friendly, knowledgeable, timely, helpful  - Great sushi. I'm picky and everything was fresh.  - Wide selection of fresh fish. Lots of options and all the fishes I like. Yes, fishes.  - Immediate drink refills. YES.  - Happy hour prices are good. Not great, but good.  - Clean bathrooms  I will be back, Fish Market.

Cheesecake Factory I love you. I love you. I love you.  I have tried every single thing on the menu. You heard me. EVERY. SINGLE. THING. (Okay, not including the new hibachi menu. That is a brand new page added recently)  It was all good. Mostly great. But if about 90% of your 1,000,000,000 menu items are awesome - you deserve 5 stars from me.  PS - Please clean your bathroom more frequently. This might knoock you down a star.

If this place wasn't so darn convenient I might never come back. Despite being pissed off EVERY time I come here, I continue to come back again and again. In Zen 32's defense, they do have:  + A great location + Very fresh fish + Low carb rolls + Possibly the best tuna in town + Creative and tasty specialty rolls + Good sushi selection + Neat little complimentary sunomo type appetizer +  A really good drink menu (yummy plum wine!) + A great happy hour + Great atmosphere  Unfortunately these great plusses are often overshadowed by these annoying minuses:  - Long wait for a table, even when several tables are empty - Rude/clueless hostesses - Rude/clueless manager - Crazy overzealous water misters that soak your table (outdoors) - Most uncomfortable outdoor seating. Ever - About 2 really good waitresses, and about 10 clueless waitresses  - Wait staff has no idea what is in the specialty rolls - Long wait for food - Confusing happy hour rules - Tables really close together - Disappointing desserts - Disappointing appetizers  So basically you have to do the math and see if the +'s outweigh the -'s. I think they do, so you will probably see me there this week.

Well... good ol' Gabi K took me here for lunch a few months ago (THANKS GABI) and I've been back for lunch several times since. It's the kind of place I want to hate just because I want to hate hip, cool, yuppy crack dens. And La Grande Orange is totally a yuppy version of a crack den! Think about it. What type of stuff  = crack for wealthy suburban white people? Here is a list:  Gelato Cupcakes 2 Hour lunches on a Tuesday Green Tea Crap with Fennel Gourmet Pizza 3 hour lunches on a Tuesday Multi-Grain Bread Avocados lunch dates tuna parking lots full of hybrid cars lunch (in general)  So because I am a self-loathing suburban white chick - I friggin' love this place!!!  Now who wants to have lunch?

Bring on the mojitos!  Or a pitcher of sangria. Both are terrific at Havana.  Even if you aren't interested in alcohol you are in luck. This place is worth it without the booze too.  Every time I come here I am so happy. The place is usually bustling and busy, yet I never have to wait. The service is so friendly that I feel valued as a patron and the food is great.    Some of the dishes I recommend:   - The salads are out of this world. All of them are a good choice. My fave involves onions, avocados and mangoes  - The Cho-Cho is a great vegetarian dish. I'm a flesh eatin', animal killin' meat eater but I still enjoy this menu item  - Fish! Every fishy is yummy here. The best are the Sea Bass, Shrimp and the Tilapia   - The Pollo Cubana is an excellent basic chicken/rice/bean dish    - The Ropa Vieja was okay. Pretty good but not out of this world  - The desserts are excellent. The coconut flan with mango sauce is my new favorite thing ever   - They put limes in my diet coke. YES! Nice touch.  * One word of caution: They make you valet during the weekend. Not a fan of the unnecessary (but very personable) valet. Boo!  ** Second word of caution: The bathrooms are outside and around the corner. Be prepared to feel like you are walking down a shady alley if you have to pee. Maybe fear of an alley attack is part of the charm. Just like in Cuba, I guess.

I'm an  Italian girl from New York and I can honestly say: Marcellino is one of the BEST Italian restaurants in the Valley.   If you like home made pasta, flavorful sauces, great wine and all the other elements that make a great Italian place - this is it! It even reminds me of a place back east with the owner (owner's wife?) working the door and the old school dessert ray presented by the waiter.   Marcellino is not cheap, but it's price in on par with other high end Italian like Bravo Bistro, Um Bacio, Le Cabaffe, Tamasos...etc. But Marcellino might be the best!

Just what this town needs. Another Gelato joint, right?  The funny thing is no matter how many new gelato stores pop up, they are all still so damn good. It must be hard to get gelato wrong because just like it's 12,000 forefathers scattered about the Valley - this place rocks.   Flavors I tried: (Pretty much every one in there)  - Wild Berry  - Chocolate Cake - Tropical Fruit - Caramel - Peanut butter - Strawberry - Cookies and Cream - Car Battery - Scuba Mask - Monkey Poo - Whatever I can't remember the names  The chick at the counter was friendly and I did not hate her at all, so that was a bonus. In fact I think she was really hung over and came to work directly proceeding a walk of shame. So that made me like her more.   They could lose the loud Gloria Estefan music pumping through the speakers, though.    Everything else A-okay.

Best oral surgeon ever! I have all these annoying and complicated dental issues and he has been patient and professional through years or surgery. His staff is knowledgeable and courteous and I never have to wait too long for an appointment. Surgery is scary but I completely trust Dr. Fish. Apparently others agree too as he always wins "Best Oral Surgeon" in Phoenix Magazine every year.

This is probably my favorite boutique in Arizona. Great clothes, great selection, helpful sales people. I love all the clothes in this store. Finally a  shopping experience that rivals that of our more fashionable cities.   They always have great dresses, over sized shirts and tailored blouses. And I love the hats. Last season they had these giant sun hats that are probably only appropriate at a socialite's funeral or the Kentucky Derby. I want one of those hats!!! Now if I could only squeeze my fat ass into those size 25 skinny jeans...  Both locations are good but I like the Camelback/Waterfront better. Sorry Kierland.

Tacky, but not tacky enough to be fun. I'm all for cheesy rhinestone belts and bedazzled t-shirts but this store only carries overpriced goods for aging teenager wannabes (read: cougars). But I might be biased because I really am confused by the people from Electric Ladyland and they own this place too.

Cowboys and gangsters and mechanical bull riding and cheap booze and wet  shirt contests and random concerts and beer tub girls in ass-less chaps. How can you fuck this up? Graham Central Station is so ridiculous that it should be awesome.  But it isn't. Somehow. HOW?  This place is a huge mess. Every person in here frightens me.   I guess  you could get totally hammered and try to ignore the scariness and really party here. But I can't do it.  But I dare YOU to do it. If you do go here, please tell us alllllllll about it.

This is the WORST airline ever. I will gladly be herded onto Southwest like some fat ass cattle rather than ever endure the torture of US Airways again.  How can any businesses possibly be such a mess? Ever since they were merged with craptastic America West it's been downhill. Every person from the counter bitches to the flight attendants were out of control rude. It's clear this airline does not value their customers.  The flight attendants were so rude on my last flight that it shocked me.   And now you want to charge me $30 for an aisle seat. Fuck you!  And don't tell me it's just the industry that's taking a dive because riding on Jet Blue is like going to freaking Disneyland! Polite customer service people, happy flight attendants, snacks, tv's, on time arrivals.... dignity.

I LOVE this place. I think it's because it's the first bar I visited in Downtown Phoenix. I lived in Tempe/Scottsdale for 7 years and never set foot in a Phoenix based watering hole.  I went to places like Axis Radius and Dos Gringos. I didn't even know places like Bikini existed in Arizona.  The first time I visited Bikini Lounge it was hot and crowded. I think it was on a First Friday but it was back in the day when like. nobody went to art walk. (Circa 2003/2004). Anyway, within my first few minutes in the bar the bartender yelled at me for ordering a drink that wasn't on the menu, I was accosted by a crazy psychic and a tranny hooker stole my cigarettes. I think someone also tried to light my coat on fire.   So basically it was awesome. By the end of the night I was drinking cheap beer straight out of the pitcher and dancing in a conga line behind the bar. A year later I moved to Phoenix and Bikini was the first place I went to celebrate.

Giddy up bitches!  If you want cowboy music, a live band and to get really reaally drunk in a cool place in Scottsdale I highly reccomend The Rusty Spur.   Also, the Psychobilly Rodeo Band is the greatest thing that ever happened to me. They play the best country western standards with a few hilariously amazing original songs.   The only downside is that the bar is really small and tourists and hen party chicks come here. Other than that  - awesome in every way.  Go check it out!

Ew. Everyone and everything. Every single time I go here it reminds me to stay the F outta Scottsdale.   I must stress that it's not 6's fault. Its just  that every single miserable person inside 6 kind of sucks. Everyone always looks so unhappy and hateful. Bitches are clocking you left and right. The bottle service chicks always act so bothered to pour you a drink. The dudes look kind of like chicks.  Actually the doormen are always really nice here. I'm surprised at how professional and courtesous they are. The bartenders are pretty on point too.  Oh.. and I always see at least one person I know - and HATE here. Which is kind of awesome. Maybe I like to hate too.  Good thing I'm getting too old for this place. Play nice kiddies because mommy ain't coming back.

Great place to see live comedy. Last night I saw my boyfriend (Yelper Scott S.) performed a set at The Comedy Spot. He performs there on a semi-regular basis.  I'll be honest. Most comedy clubs are dirty and gross and the people who work there are mean. They harass you about the 2 drink minimum, are rude about seating, have shitty service and basically treat customers like poo. The Comedy Spot used to be a little douchey like that but lately they've just been awesome.  The waitress was totally on point, bringing me drinks at a rapid pace. (Newcastle, score!) All the comedians were really funny - one was a little too drunk to be up there - but still pretty funny and the owner, Sean, even did a really funny set just f-ing with the audience.  Of course the highlight for me was seeing Scott perform. He's the best! But overall a very good experience.

I thought I already reviewed Cowboy Ciao, but apparently not. Actually, I'm really surprised I haven't gushed for pages about this place already because it's frickin' awesome.  I hate to sound like a foodie asshat, but the menu at Cowboy Ciao is truly inventive. Peanut Butter Chocolate Bacon Brittle (for Dessert)and Blue Cheese Bread Pudding Pork Chops (main course) are just two of the insanely good things I ate the Cowboy tonight.   The best things on the menu are the Stetson Chopped Salad (hands down the #1 chopped salad of all time) and the Mushroom Panfry. (I can't explain it, just order it). I have to have both every time I eat here.   Some people might be freaked out by the menu, but those people suck. So please do not suck and go to this restaurant immediately.  Giddy Up.

Oh. My. God.  My lunch at Changs was so good that I am still losing my mind. Everything I ate was perfect. Things I ate included:  - Streamed Shrimp Dumplings  - Shanghai Cucumbers  - Shrimp Melon Salad  - Schezwan Shrimp  - Lemongrass Shrimp with Noodles  - Shrimp with Lobster Sauce  - Mango Iced Tea  Yes that is a lot of shrimp, and yes every single bite was damn good. Also, yes I am a giant fat ass who orders 7 things for lunch. So? It was THAT good.  All you freaks who hate chain restaurants and refuse to like PF Changs just because it's all corporate are really missing out. Missing out on great service, instant refills, perfectly cooked deliciously spiced food and a solid place to eat.

You should only eat at Defalco's if you have a lot of time on your hands. The line to order your food is really looooooooong and the wait to get your food after you order borderlines on absurd.   Other than that, and if you have an extra 8 hours on hand, this place is pretty good. The cashier is friendly, the food is fresh and  tastes above average and the portions are big, but not so big it is offensive (Cafe Delux I'm talking to you). Also they have lot's of good drinks like Diet. Dr. Pepper in the fountain or Dr. Brown's soda in the bottle.   Some dishes I tried and liked include: Chicken cutlet sandwich, Chicken parm dinner and sandwich, chef salad, chicken pesto sandwich, turkey sandwich, blt, tuna salad, baked ziti, all the soup - oh - and the mozerella caprese sandwich is the best thing on the menu.   Okay, I'm giving it one more star. I was going to give it 3 but I guess it deserves 4.

Pretty good. The bread is a bit greasy for me though. Extra points for using Boards Head meat and having so many different mustards and sauces.   The soup in the bread bowl is the highlight of the day. I like the chicken noodle. It's so bad for you but worth it every once in a while.  I also feel 90 years old when I eat at this location. I'm not even 30 but the college kiddies look at me like, bitch please.

Hot boys! Yay!  Hot boys that don't want to make out with me. Boo!  Amsterdam is a hop, skip and a jump away from my homo - er my home, so I end up here quite a lot. They have good drinks, a nice patio and lots of eye candy. There is a little bit of attitude here, but I think that makes Amsterdam extra spicy. I definitely recommend this place to gay friends and straight friends, alike.  One issue, though. True story:  About 1 year ago I was in the bathroom at Amsterdam. I exited the bathroom and about 5 seconds later realized I left my PURSE in the bathroom stall. (Drunk, anyone?).  I turned right around and went right back in the b-room and politely knocked on the stall door and asked if the woman inside could hand me my purse. Here is where it got CRAZY.  Me: May I please have my purse. I accidentally left it in the stall.  Woman in Stall: There's no purse in here  Me: Are you sure? I just left and you just walked right in. Can you look? Please?  WIS: I SAID there isn't a purse in here. (Then I think she called me a bitch and started yelling)  Me: I'm really sorry to bother you, but I KNOW my purse is in there. I'll just wait until you are done.  WIS: FLINGS stall door open and THROWS my purse at me! Clearly she went through my whole purse. Credit card receipts are all over the place. The wallet is emptied into my purse and on the floor. Cash is missing.   I'm all WTF? And she storms out of bathroom. My male friend (who is totally flamboyant and over the top) is in the doorway screaming and trying to stop her, but she shoves him out of the way.   I look in my purse and can't find my phone. Holy shit! Where's my phone?????????  We search the stall, the bathroom and finally find it...  IN THE USED TAMPON BIN! Yes, in the nasty white tampon box thing in the corner of the stall.  That bitch put my cell phone in the TAMPON BIN!!!  Ew.  So moral of the story? Amsterdam is good, but beware of purse thieving  tampon whores.

Best gourmet Mexican food EVER. The key word is gourmet. If you want dirty Mexican go to La Toltecta. This is more high-end than is usually expected from tacos.  They also have the best drinks EVER. Check out the drink menu. I recommend pretty much everything on it.

I love you, I hate you...  Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall pretty much embodies everything that is wrong with the world. It's a flashy, pretentious, over-priced suburban hell hole that encourages vapid shallow  people to waste their hard earned money on useless crap they don't need.  Ugly clothes created for unimaginative people hang like uniforms in store windows. Gucci and Louis Vuitton encourage 30k millionaires to max out thier credit cards, ironically, on a wallet. The food court is overflowing with spoiled 12 year old girls in slutty Victoria Secret "Pink" shorts, $1,000 handbags and way too much eyeliner.   So... I pretty much love this place. In all seriousness I will probably be there tomorrow, so meet me by the Louboutins on the first floor of Neiman's. Bring your Amex.... but only if it's black!

WTF this place has really gone downhill.  I ate here twice last week and neither time was impressive.   Meal one: My turkey burger was so dry and yucky that I only ate the avocado off the top. The burger was like hockey puck. The bun was a little stale. The fries were okay. The waitress did not notice my disdain.   Meal two: Seriously the worst grilled cheese Panini I ever had. The sweet potato fries were okay but didn't hold a candle to Fez fries.   I do like purse hooks at the bar.   I remember a time when Delux served delicious food that was well prepared and um..actually tasted good. Now two sucky sandwiches later I long for the yesteryear of Delux.  Even the a la care fries lost their charm.  Step it up Delux you are losing me!

Camelback is my favorite workout  and outdoor activity in Arizona. It's a really tough hike but the view from the top is totally worth it. I also love that everyone is so randomly friendly on the mountain. Douchewads, MILFS, old dudes, the lady with the parrot on her shoulder (seriously, a lady climbs the hill every day with BIRD)...etc ... we are all one on Camelback Mountain.   And it's nice to be that way every once in a while.  Better get climbing before they build a Starbucks at the summit!

Love it! Seriously I am addicted to the Gelato here. It's creamy and light and delicious. The staff is so friendly and they don't even mind when I ask to try like 20 different flavors.    The best thing about this place is the green tea. They have the most amazing Macha green tea in the world. My only complaint is that it's about $4 for a very small amount of tea. I wish they served larger sizes. I could drink a keg at a time.

Have you had the kisras or the sweet potato/garlic fries at FEZ? If not...GO GET SOME RIGHT NOW. They are heavenly. Also, if you are in the mood for great mixed drinks, a trendy modern atmosphere and cute sexy boys everywhere this is the place for you. If you are a chick the boys might not be looking back at you, but hey - nothing wrong with a little eye candy.  Fez actually makes me excited about the dreaded light rail. The train will go straight from my doorstep to Fez.

The food at Matt's Big Breakfast is pretty great. I defy you to find a better omelette anywhere in town.  However...  I don't know why they had to go ahead and screw up perfectly good food with such terrible service.  Do not go to Matt's if you are thirsty. It takes forever to get your drinks and forget about re-fills. The waiters all act like you are bothering them if you ask for anything. The act like the good food gives them carte blanche to drop the ball on service entirely. Also - STOP using so much OIL. Yucky!  ***Edited on 10/07 to add the following: The staff at Matt's must be reading all the Yelp's about their poor service because I went back there today and they were really NICE! It was the first time they have ever been so attentive, quick and nice. And they were not just nice to me. They were nice to everyone. It was awesome! There is one kind of bitchy, slow, mean waitress who was not there today - so maybe everyone is in a better mood on her day off. I hope this trend of excellent service at Matt's continues. It it does I will re-Yelp with only positive things to say. Except...still...chill out with the oil!

I frickin' love this place. I feel like everyone wants to hate this place and write about it's suckery and suckdom, but I have only had positive experiences here.  The food is pretty good - I've had the nachos, tacos, enchiladas and some random salad and all were good. Not excellent - but very good. I also enjoy the margaritas here. Love the decor.  Yeah - so a lot of douches hang out here. So? Just bring your own homies and it will be okay.

The Harkins Camelview 5 gives Arizonans the unique opportunity to see movies that are normally reserved for screens in NY and CA. Without this theater there would be very little chance to see independent or foreign films in Phoenix. I give a lot of credit to Dan Harkins for keeping this theater open. He certainly can't  make much money at this location. It's financially  impractical to keep such a small theater operating on such prime real estate. This just shows Dan Harkin's commitment to sharing great films with the people of AZ.   Thanks Dan!

The chicken tacos literally tasted like cat food and were the worst I've ever had. That aside, I dig this place.  Here's why...  - Cool 70s-ish tables and chairs - Cozy and dark and almost cave-like (in a good way) - Great menu - lots of choices - Awesome drink menu - Drunk people whooping it up at the bar - Lots of salt on rim of margarita (and they even brought me extra salt when I asked, yay) - Lotions and potions and girly stuff in the bathroom  Despite the taco situation, I just kind of want to go back. Immediately.

Am I supposed to hate Ikea? Because I don't. I freakin LOVE it.   I'm a NY'er at heart. So I miss diverse crowds of people who don't speak English crammed into loud places fighting and stabbing each other in the face for bargains. Like Century 21. (New Yorkers will know I am NOT talking about the real estate company when I say Century 21)  Anyway, what I'm trying to say is: Even though I get lost every single time I go here, and I can't escape without dropping $1,000 for bags of random stuff like Ikopnhappen and Rokkerslappen EVERY TIME I GO HERE - just to window shop  - I still LOVE me some Ikea.  I scored an awesome double decker couch that converts into BUNK BEDS and champagne glasses for $4. Holla!  Take away one star because the shit they sell requires assembly and the ridiculous photos on the instructions don't help. But who cares? That's what my new hot pool boy/handyman/crash test dummy is for.  Also, the Swedish meatballs and ice cream rock socks. Yeah, I've eaten at Ikea. We all know I will eat anywhere.

I should hate you, Lola. You force me to do things I don't want to do. Such as get drunk and eat until I explode.  I had no intention of getting tipsy, but your Sangria was so good that I drank the entire pitcher of red AND white. WTF? I don't even like wine.  I had no intention of eating so much that I got sick, but I couldn't resist eating every single garbanzo bean and spinach leaf in sight.   Ugggggg. Tummy ache.  But worth it.

Why is everybody hating on Trader Vic's? It's dope.  Stop pretending you are too cool for delicious food, silly (yet awesome) tiki themed novelty drinks and uber friendly waiters. This place rocks your socks and you know it.  5 stars!

I don't know why I even bother trying to go here. Every single time I walk in this place I end up walking right back out. I tried to go there with Mark J TWICE in December and both times we ended up walking out within 120 seconds. Lame!  The Roosevelt is either too crowded, or there isn't any seating, or it's filled with hipster douche bags or the service eats a dick.  My recent problems with this place include:  - Inadequate seating  - Huge waste of space/not laid out well  - Staff consists of asshats mixed with a few very cool staffers. Most of the chicks who work here are cool, but I encountered several dick tard dudes.  - Why is there a security gaurd/rent a cop here at all times? He is nice but it is too creepy for comfort. What is this? The Arizona Mills Mall?  - The suckdom ruined my birthday  - Mean people giving mean looks hamg out here a lot  On the flipside the beer selection is good and I ate here once a looooooooooooooong time ago and I think I thought it was good. I can't remember because it was so long ago. I'd love to eat here again but I can't seem to tolerate this place for more than a few minues before I stomp on off and out the front door.  Do better Roosevelt.

I love chessy stuff and Movin' serves up cheesy pop and hip hop on a silver platter. My only complaint is the signal isn't very strong. I am a runner and I lose the radio signal whenever I jog up Central Ave. Boo!

Things I love in this world:  1. Fish 2. Steak 3. Old rich guys 4. HUGE fake boobs 5. Cougars with huge fake boobs 6. The circus  So this much is pretty much like Disneyland and for me. Circus boobs aside, this place has great food. Everything from the hot pretzels in the bread basket to the extensive selection of fresh fish is fantastic. The service is usually pretty good and they make a mean dirty martini.  And did I mention all the fake boobs?  Perfection.

I like this place. Possibly even more than the one in Los Angeles. Actually I slipped and fell and busted my ass in front of a dozen people at the one in LA so maybe that has something to do with it. But I digress...  Asia De Cuba has really good food. It is probably among the best in the Valley. Everything I tried - from the fish to the chicken to pretty much every app. on the menu was delicious. And the mojitos. Woot! Possibly the best mojito I ever had.   One complaint: The band was sooooooooo loud. My date and I purposefully chose a table as far away from the band as possible and we still couldn't really hear each other or the waiter. The live music would have been a nice touch but instead it was just annoying. Turn it down please.  Otherwise this is a solid place.   Skybar on the other hand... that's another review.

OMG the protien pancakes get 5 stars. They are amazing. I also like that they have healthy menu options and totally sinful menu options too.  The rest of the food is pretty good. 4 stars.

I LOVE At One Yoga. I seriously would go there every single day - maybe twice a day -  if it wasn't so damn expensive. Why is it so expensive??? Boo hoo.   Anyway, price aside - I think this is one of the best Yoga spots I've ever been too. They have tons of classes at convenient times, great instructors, spacious clean and comfortable rooms and a great variety of classes and instructors too. I really like Jen C and Sarah B. The Flow classes rock and the hip hop class is the best thing ever. The classes at the Scottsdale location are better than the Phoenix location, but I'm not sure why. I think they are more intense in Scottsdale.  To be honest with you, I tried Yoga dozens of times and never really liked it until my experience with At One Yoga. So thank you At One Yoga - you introduced me to a new love...that I can't afford.

I had no idea this place even existed which is retarded because I live less than a mile away. The first time I went there I thought I was following some people in to a house party until I got inside and was like "oh sh*t - it's a bar." I was a pleasant surprise. Anyway, on to my review.  The good:   - Location - I'm always a fan of new businesses finding success in downtwn Phoenix.    - Seating: It's not a large space but I always manage to find a seat   - Beer selection is awesome  - Good lighting/atmosphere  The bad:  - You can't take your beer outside on the porch/outdoor area  - Hipsters, please kill yourself  - Staff, please read above statement (be nice to people even if we aren't artists/emo/punk/goth...etc. )  In summary,  I'm sure I'll be there a lot because the beer is good and it's close to my house.  *** Edited to add: Last night I went back to Lost Leaf and the staff was really nice/cool/non-hipster-ish.  So disregard the hipster staff criticism, at least on Saturday night. The Sat. night crew is cool.

Haus please get some new stuff. All your inventory is being knocked-off by Target and I'm inclined to pay $29.99 instead of $2,999 for a plate or a rock or a book about poop or whatever.   Otherwise you rock.  Sincerely,  Jenn

Oh hell no.  I don't understand the hype. I was totaly grossed out. I love sushi but did not like this place at all. It was overpriced, the menu was limited and the fish was a little too fishy for my tastes. It was like a lot of the sushi places I visited in Japan - but it was NOT like the good ones.  I know Hana is one of the most authentic sushi restaurants in Phoenix, but that doesn't mean EVERYTHING has to be covered in mayonaise, does it? I hate mayo. The Hana roll was supposed to be a "house specialty" but it was just about as special as the Shrimp roll at Safeway. The Hamachi Kama was a highlight, but might have been a bit over cooked. The tuna sashimi was chewy and rough. Ew! Sashimi should melt in your mouth, not take longer to take down than roadside beef jerky.   Also - green tea in a can? I can get that at Lee Lee's market. Fresh brew it or gring it up in a bowl or something. No cans please.  I DID dig all the punk rock lesbian servers. The contrast of small Asian men to big lezbot women was priceless.

Yeah...notsomuch.  Sprinkles is sooooooooo not worth the wait . Or the chaos. Or the hype. Or the attitude from the morons who work there. Other things that are terrible about Sprinkles include...  - The cupcakes are not that great. I ordered two. The vanilla was okay, the cinnamon was dry and chalky and I really disliked it.  - This place is a disorganized mess.   - There is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process. My friends and I were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes. Just stupid.  - The owners must have purposely only hired people who cannot think for themselves or make decisions. No sane person could possibly work here without being like "um...there might be a better way to do this..."  - Also, the employees were rude. Did I mention dumb?  So get this: I attempted to order a bottle of water. I told the clerk it's 100+ degrees outside, I walked there and I'm realllllllly thirsty. The idiot at the counter told me "You can order a water here but you must wait for your name to be called to receive the water and pay for it." I pointed out that the water was RIGHT THERE and there wasn't anyone currently paying or using the register. Couldn't she just sell me a water? She said "NO" and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER (just the word "water") on a cupcake order slip. She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up.  I was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLL-TO-THE-NO!"   I said "It's quite simple. Just hand me the water and I will hand you money. End of discussion." (There are the actual words out of the mouth!)  She looked really mad and also possibly terrified of me and my 5'4" 110 lbs of fury. Thankfully she handed me my water so I did not have to stab her. Which was good because I was waaaaaaaaay too thirsty to stab anyone.   I must be properly hydrated in order to commit crimes of passion. And I'm mad crazy passionate about my cupcakes, yo.

Beautiful!  Whenever I come here I feel like I am in Sedona, but with a little more glitz. The whole Sanctuary property is gorgeous and the Jade bar is no exception. It's a bit small, but cozy. The outdoor patio is great in the fall.  I'm not much of a martini person but the ones I tried here were pretty good. They do make a mean dirty martini.   The Jade Bar is must do in Phoenix. Get a little dressed up and enjoy the view.

The selection is small, but what they have is good.   First, I am biased because Spoken is within walking distance from my house. That automatically makes me excited about it. Second, they carry a lot of dresses, and I heart dresses. So bonus points there.  Another great thing is the mixed price point of the clothing. They carry dresses for $200 - $500 but also have a great selection of Free People and Kenzie for just under $100.   I've only been there once but I'll be sure to check it out again and again. Will update my review.

I love this place.  They have the best DIY salads ever. I am seriously head over heels in love with the "create your own" salad concept. They also have a sandwhich station, which is like an awesome upscale Subway, as well as a pasta station.   And the filled cupcakes. FILLED! My biggest complaint about most cupcakes in that all the yummy frosting is on top. Well, dish makes cupcakes with frosting in the middle. Heaven.  Dish is clean, sunny and spacious with very friendly and helpful staff. I never have to wait too long in the salad line and they are really cool about letting you sample before you buy. I have not eaten in the formal sit down section of Dish, but the DIY stations, bakery, coffee bar and deli case are all top notch.  Just thinking about Dish makes me want my butter lettuce/white bean/broccoli/asaparagus/roasted pepper/almond/cheese/shrimp salad with house dressing. So good.

Am I the only one who finds this place over priced and under whelming? They kept changing the price on me - even if the website says $20 - they will tell you it really means $40. (hidden charges BS)  Good concept, poor execution. RUDEST staff I've ever heard.  And I wrote "heard" because I heard them say negative things about several of the customers after they left. Are you kidding me??? I didn't even want to think about what they were going to say about me when I was gone.  The one star is for playing Legally Blonde 2 on a huge plasma tv while I was getting my nails done. That was dope.  Otherwise...boo!

Perhaps calling yourself a food "hut" isn't the best way to advertise. We all know what Pizza Hut is like. The name Thai Hut kind of scared me and kept me away for a litle while.   I'm glad I eventually got over the name issue because this place is totally great. So far I've only eatern here twice, but both times were bad ass.   Soups Great Curry dishes Great Summer Rolls Great Salads Great Thai tea great Service Great  Dessert...dissapointing :(  Other than that, four stars. Can't wait to try the lunch menu. See you at the hut!

The service here is always pretty bad. The service is rude and inattentive on a regular basis, but last night takes the cake.   So last night Mark J and I are cruising around downttown/midtown wondering what is open (and tasty) at 9 PM on a Saturday night. We spy a sign on Thai Hut's door = OPEN TILL 10 PM. Score!  We go in and sit down. A few minutes after we order drinks (and the waiter brings us the wrong drinks, btw) we get news that two more of our friends will be joining us. A waitress approaches us to take our order, but we tell her it will be a few more minutes because we are waiting for two more people to arrive.  The waitress comes back in a few minutes to try to take our order again. We tell her we are still waiting. The waitress comes back and informs us the kitchen is closing in 10 minutes so we have to order soon.  It's 9:22 PM.   Us: "But we thought you are open till 10PM?"  Her: "The kichen closes in 10 minutes."  Us: So you really close at 9:30 then?"  (waitress puts on nervous smile)  Her: (paraphrasing) "We don't want to rush you, but the asshole behind the counter  - who may or may not be the owner - does not want to earn your business, has no regard for customers and wants you to hurry the fuck up and get out"  Us: WTF?  She walks away - comes back 60 seconds later, I shit you not  Her: "The kitchen closes in 5 minutes"  Me: (in my mind) "Listen bitch..."  One of our friends arrives. She brings him a menu and pretty much tells us we MUST order right away.  (paraphase)  All of us: "peace the F out, biatch."  So we left.  It is now 9:30 PM. The waitress lost her tip and Thai Hut lost my desire to ever eat there again.  This sucks.

4 stars is the perfect way to describe Taggia. It reaches for 5 star perfection, but just doesn't quite make it. Tthere are so many random intangible things that are keeping it from being a 5 star joint but I can't put my finger on it. Anyway, this place is pretty damn good.  The service was very friendly and nice. What impressed me is the support staff. Everyone from the hostess to the bussers to the food runners went out of their way to be over-the-top nice, accomodating and attentive. I swear - no less than THREE seperate managers came by to ask us if everything was to our satisfaction. While some might find this annoying, I found it refreshing. Most managers - as Eminem might say "just don't give a fuck."  But at Taggia they DO give a fuck, so yay.  Also, the food was surprisingly good. Why do I write "surprisingly?" Because something about the place screamed "this food is going to suck." But it didn't!  It was excellent.   The pre-dinner bread is awesome. Not just "oh great. bread" type of good bread. It's large chucks of nuts and fresh baked kind of good bread.  The burrata - a caprese type dish with arugula, speck and Taggiasche olive pesto was INSANE. Eat this. It's offbeat and delish.  Props to the chef for offering a varity of pasta dishes without cream sauce. All the pasta choices looked good to me. I had a difficult time choosing. But the one I chose... HOLLA!  I had mushroom ravioli topped with asparagus, and dungeness crab. The mushroom ravioli was DOUBLE INSANE - and possibly one of the best rav's I ever had. However - and this is part of the 4 star-not-5-star part  - While the crab asparagus mix was good - it wasn't nearly as good as the ravioli. It was almost a bit fishy and I found myself scraping crab off the pieces of pasta to maintain the integrity of the fresh pasta and mushrooms. Once I seperated the crab and ate it as a seperate side dish things were cool.  Dessert - none of it appealed to me so I skipped it. That's huge because I never want to skip dessert. I think people who like European style sweets will be pleased with the selection, though.  I'm not sure if I'll be back because this place is so random, but they certainly earned a return visit. I actually feel guilty withholding the 5th star because everyone there tried so hard.   Uggg - the trials and tribulations of Yelping...  Fine. I'll go back to Taggia. Sometime.

Possibly the best restaurant in Scottsdale - if not all of Arizona. I don't even know where to begin. I just love this place.  I came here for a quick lunch and ended up having a multi-course dining experience full of decadent food, eclectic drinks and wonderful service. I think I even got a little drunk. It was 1 PM, so that's always nice. Basically I ate and ate and ate and ate and ate and I can't wait to eat here again.  Some highlights:  Great lunch tasting menu - also love the a la carte menu  Love that there are three kitchens. You can get fresh sushi, salads or yummy hot dishes  REAL green tea! Green tea is my favorite drink and I can't stand when inauthentic flavoring is used. Roka uses actual green tea. Yay!  The most delicious black cod EVER  The most delicious butterfish EVER  The most delicious asparagus EVER!  Lobster dumplings  An amazingly HUGE and tasty Prawn dinner  Great sushi - fresh, delicious  A great drink menu including an array of soju drinks  Interesting mix of non-alcoholic drinks (apple mojito with no booze)  They carry my favorite beer. THANK YOU!  Impeccable service  Groovy looking clean bathrooms  Beautiful restaurant - love the atmosphere, dcor...etc  ***BONUS - I think the table next to us didn't like the restaurant because the menu was too "different." I hate that. If you want crappy food...go to Applebees A-holes! I'll keep Roka Akor to myself.

I'm into this place. I've only been here a few times but it is quickly becoming a regular hangout. The best part is the porch, but it will be too hot to enjoy that soon. So boo for that.  Good stuff:  Lots of good beer Most people who work here are not douchetards Most people who hang out here are not douchetards The cheese plate was big and delicious Good jukebox Good patio I think they have darts and crap inside but I was too toasty to remember  The bad: One bathroom  So yay for The Rose and Crown. Good times.

Meh. Well...worse than meh.  Here's the thing. The food isn't very good and the prices are insanely high. Actually, the food was almost bad and the prices were out of control, BUT the service was pretty good and the chips and salsa were amazing, so there are your 3 stars.   When you first walk in you will notice bowls of avocados sitting on your table.   "OMG! I bet they make table side guacamole!" I exclaimed.  Well they sure do. For $10. Fuck that. $10 is too much for a tiny mini bowl of 2 avocados mixed with chili seasoning and onions. Unless I'm drunk or really hungry, which means I will buy anything. But I wasn't, so I didn't. No table side gauc for me.  Next, the main course. Everything on the menu is beef, pork, chicken or beef, pork, chicken and cream. What if you aren't a huge fatty and CARE about your health? What if you want fresh fish or veggies or if you want your beef/chicken/pork without cream. I guess I shouldn't have eaten that second bowl of tortilla chips, huh? Now I am on a fat rant.  So I order enchiladas - but for the love of god HOLD THE CREAM. The enchiladas were disappointing. I'd give them a C+ or maaaaaaybe a B- because they came on a bed of spinach. (interesting). Maybe the cream would have saved them but I don't think it is necessary to add cream to make a good enchilada, and neither do most Mexican restaurants with much better  ones. The enchiladas were at most bland and blah and not worth $14. I don't mind paying a lot for good Mexican Food, but this wasn't very good.   I was eating with fellow yelper Scott S. He had the chili relleno. He said is was below average.  By the way, their cheese enchiladas had CHUNKS of beef in the enchilada sauce. Mind you, these are a separate menu items from the beef enchiladas. So your choices are:  Enchiladas with beef Enchiladas with cheese and secret beef, of which you become aware of after you bite in Enchiladas with cheese, secret beef and cream  Blech. Die.  At least the iced tea was flowing and the chips and salsa were seiously kick ass.  Hmm... if I wasn't in a generous mood I might be tempted to take away another star. But I won't. Just like I probably won't be back.

The food is pretty much inedible. After dark it turns into a hot, sweaty, ugly, trashy dance fest of scary people...who want to fight...or worse yet...fuck.  Two stars because it is possible to day drink here and survive. But for the love of god as soon as the sun goes down run. RUN!

I want to love this place so badly that I am giving it four stars, even though deep down I know Breadfruit is only a 3 star place. For now.   First, I love the location. It's close to my home and in a really great urban space, so points for that. Second, the people there are SO nice. Seriously, the woman who took our order was so sweet and attentive that it *almost* made me feel ashamed of being such a biatch all the time. I wanted to run out and buy a kitten or save an orphanage in order to be as nice as her.   We had about a 20 minute wait before we were seated, but it was worth it for the experience. For some reason I really wanted to check this place out. I was reading the menu online and got to words like "curry...dumplings...plantains... coconut rice...tilapia..." and was like ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... these are all things I love! The menu is beyond interesting. It's downright alluring. Everything on it sounded so delicious and intriguing. Then I found out that unfortunately the food only kind of delivers on the menu's promise.   Things I ate:  Avocado Plantain Spring Rolls with Mango Chutney -  Meh. A little dry. A lot boring. Very disappointing. These could be amazing with a little effort.  Escovich Fish and Festival: The fish was actually very good. So was the sweet bread thing that came with it. I wish there was a little something else though...felt like it was missing something.  Curried Chicken and Dumpling: Is this a dumpling or a ROCK? Seriously - the dumpling was kind of like a hockey puck, but I admit it was kind of a tasty hockey puck so I'm conflicted on this one. The chicken and veggies were good and the plantains were awesome. The cooked cabbage was a little undercooked and I am pretty much turning into my grandmother (a little old Russian lady) so I like my cabbage prepared just right, please.  Gret's Grapenut Ice Cream and Jello: HOLY CRAP THIS IS GOOD. Seriously, you have to try this dessert. It rocks socks.  Okay, now I'm beginning to think  The Breadfruit really does deserve four stars. Get your liquor license and I'll be totally convinced.

Fuck you, douchebags!  The uppity asshat-ness of the doormen and pretty much everyone in here was at defcon 1. I was really surprised  that it was that bad. The other place  - Stingray Sushi - is awesome. I expected Stingray style service and manners, but was really dissapointed.  The biggest problem was that the "doormen" were rude to a bunch of guys I was with. They said they couldn't come in because of "dress code." They said "no flip flops." This was ridiculous because:  A: They let me in. I was wearing flip flops.  B. They have a wide open window that showed at least a dozen other guys inside wearing flip flops too. No dress code for the dudes inside, but there is a dress code for the guys I was with?  C. A bunch of guys and girls came in wearing flip flops after us  The guys I was with are all well dressed guys who were dressed down after a spring training game. After a little hassle over the flip flops they let us in. We asked the bartender about the dress code and she replied "what dress code." So I asked a manager about the dress code and he didn't seem to know what I was talking about.   It seems like the bounchers decided just because my friends prefer to wear Lacoste, Puma and Hugo Boss over wearing ED Hardy and those stupid-ass AFFLICATION t-shirt s.   I guess we are not cool enough for this bar. Which is fine with me.   Cool concept. Too much dickwadness in the way of having a good time.  I will give it another try on another night and see if it was a fluke. Stay tuned...  Boo!  * Edited to add more information

I think I'm going to cry. After over TEN YEARS of suffering through Arizona style sandwiches... Long Island is finally in the house!   The first thing I saw when I walked in was the potato salad... and I knew I was home. Long Island delis have a certain way of making potato salad that I've never found anywhere else in the world. So when I saw The Hero Factory's deli case my heart started to race a little. I prayed to God that his would be the real deal. By the power of Huntington please be an authentic LI deli run by real New Yorkers.  And it is!!!  Ever since I moved here from New York I've been craving a real deli sandwich. That means tons of boarshead meat on a real roll (kaiser or hero) with dressing and shredded lettuce. Chicken parm, turkey and cheese, roast beef with mustard - it doesn't matter just make it taste like home. Thankfully everything I ate at The Hero Factory tasted exactly like home.   Even if you are not from NY, you must give this place a try. They make the best heros in the Valley - hands down. You will fall in love.  The owners did a really great job of maintaining authenticity. Their accents, personality and friendly, familiar way of talking to the customers is refreshing and so very NY.   I actually feel like something good happened to me today because I discovered this place. I'll be back whenever I have a craving for good food or for home.

Honestly I feel bad writing this review but the gelato here kind of sucked. It was so dissapointing that I actually went to The Gelato Spot a few hours later for a redemption scoop. I can't put my finger on it but something was just off. The mango was kinf of hard and not fresh like at other places. The chocolate was very meh - not worth the calories.  I did enjoy watching Sponge Bob on the tv, though. And it is close to my house. Otherwise notsogood.

This is my favorite place to see live theater and comedy. I end up here pretty much every weekend. Things I love about Space 55:  - Great location. I love fun things to do that are downtown and in walking distance from bars, nightlife, my house...etc.  - They have a really unique variety of entertainment. Some of it is pretty random but it is almost always very good. Even when it's bad it's good.  - Unpretentious theater is awesome  - Improv comedy every Friday night. The Galapagos show at 10:30 PM is always awesome  - The Phoenix Neutrino Project rocks. Come see it. (Full disclosure - I am part of this)  - They do not kick me out when I get drunk and knock a picture frame off the wall and break it (although I didn't touch it I swear!)

What a disappointment. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and we both were so disappointed we almost re-booked new appts somewhere else. It wasn't horrible or dirty or gross or anything - just not the relaxing birthday experience I wanted.   First, I'll admit - I'm obsessed with spas. I go to hotel spas all the time, and I've been to almost everyone in the Valley. While this has made me slightly spoiled, it also gives me good perspective.   The VH Spa is just not very warm or comfortable or spa like. It's more like a Ikea locker room had a baby with a Massage Envy. The decor is cute and retro and funky, but the set up is not conducive to an "all inclusive spa day"  and not very relaxing. There were cleaning people and maintenance people coming in and out of the locker room. This made me a little uneasy. There was no place to really chill in the locker room - which was also the changing room - which was also the place to shower - which was also the place to "relax" - etc.   In order for a spa to be good they need a whole area just dedicated to the hot tub, steam room, dry sauna, relaxation room etc. The VH doesn't have this. That's half the reason I book the spa day in the first place. Very disappointing.  The massage itself was just ok. I'd give it a B- or maybe even a C+.   The pool was NOT relaxing at all as it was FULL of Scottsdale douches being loud and crazy and showing off their guns and their fake boobs and their tans. I'm a little of a douche myself, and I'm all for a party pool - but NOT when I'm at a spa. The DJ (yes - a DJ!) was playing "Party like a Rockstar" so loud that my sunglasses were vibrating. It was so crowded we couldn't get a chair. F that! I was a hotel guest who just had a spa treatment and I ' even "relax" by their MTV video wannabe pool party? Lame!  I went back to my room and sulked.   When we went down to the lobby for a drink we met a couple who was checking out early because their experience was so bad. They were there for a spa retreat and were very upset that the spa sucked and the pool was impossible to enjoy.   I wasn't THAT unhappy with my experience, but I did understand what they were saying.  The Valley Ho is not one of the top tier spas here in AZ, but it is certainly not the worst either. It's more kind of meh + needs improvement. I'll probably give it one more chance.

Holy goodness, this was awesome. Tonight I had a dining experience so amazing that I can't even attempt to be hateful, catty and mean about it. BLT Steak is the best restaurant in the Valley, for realz.  The Camelback Inn is a beautiful property and BLT Steak fits right in. The dining room and patio directly faces south on Lincoln, giving you a breathtaking view of Camelback Mountain. This served as a great reminder that I will have to hike my fat ass up Echo Canyon about 50 times to work off all the beef I'm about to devour. Inspirational!  The bar has attentive service, stiff drinks and serves complimentary olives, nuts and pop corn with some wizardy spices sprinkled on top. Score - because I like to pre-eat before I sit down and eat. (not being sarcastic)    The servers are great - I think we had a separate food server and beverage attendant, which was fancy and efficient - too things that rarely go hand in hand.  But the real highlight was the food. I don't even know where to begin. I'll list everything I ate, and describe it, if I can:  Bread with pate: The only thing I didn't like, but I'm not a fan of liver. Not their fault.  Moving on...  Fresh Popovers with euro butter: The second best bread experience of my life, second only to the GIANT BREAD CART at Le Louis XV, Alain Ducasse's restaurant in Monaco. (An EPIC journey in dining and a must visit for anyone who lives to eat)  Hamachi: The freshest buttery yellow tail that ever lived - or lived than died. Whatever - it was dope.  Shrimp Cocktail: Holla!   Chopped Salad: This was pretty good - but more like a greek salad hybrid. I'd skip it in favor of the...  Buffalo Mozzarella Salad: Jackpot! Cheese so soft it melted. Fresh yellow tomatoes, great dressing etc.  Filet: The best filet I've had in Arizona, dethroning Maestros and Donovan's, for sure.  Ahi Tuna: Rare, plump, buttery, holy shit.  Glazed Carrots: I'm obsessed with carrots, particularly cooked ones, and I don't know why. These carrots were off the hook and I almost ate the whole a la carte bowl.  Hash Browns: The fact that the hashies came in huge hunks of hash brown pie was pretty awesome and ridiculous  Pecan Pie: Dope, and ice-creamy  Fruit Crepe:I  wasn't a fan - too passion fruity for me. But my dining partners dug it.  Random Complimentary Dessert Cookies: A nice surprise  Sauces: Holy f-ing crap - they offer all these random sauces like peppercorn sauce, horseradish and a mustard trio. Order them ALL even though they are $3 each. Totally worth it!  I really liked this entire experience. I left fat and stuffed and happy - and didn't even feel sick or like I had to RUN - not walk - to the bathroom immediately after. Similar dining experiences at steakhouses make me dash for the loo. I know - gross. But you know it happens to you too.  BLT Steak 4E, bitches. Seriously.

Like most Fox concepts, Blanco is pretty good. I'm not rushing to come back any time soon (mainly because there is so much Mexican food in much closer proximity to my house), but I would be a repeat eater.   The food was pretty good - but not memorable. I really liked the chips and salsa and the guac. The veggie tacos were also very good. The chopped salad was good. The tuna tacos kind of meh. Good. And meh. So why the 4 stars?   Blow jobs! Well, almost. I think.  I was so impressed by the service. The hosts, waiters and managers were so attentive and friendly. Like, over-the-top friendly and giddy. Almost flirty. I'm sure if I was a dude they would have blown me or something. Next time I'm bringing a guy with me to test this theory. Anyone want to particpate in an experiment?
