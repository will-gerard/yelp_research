I think this might be a new Chinese place I need to go back and try some more. First of all, AUTHENTIC Sichuan dishes! Not just in name only! Holy cow! I picked up my parents from the airport and we decided to give this place a try since they were always disappointed at Golden Buddha. What is this? Water boiled XXXX? Last time I had that was visiting family in China! Ordered Water boiled fish and twice cooked pork. I really like the flavoring of the twice cooked pork. I wanted to order the Yu-shan pork but was overruled by parents. Oh well. They didn't want spicy, so the water boiled fish wasn't after the told the waiter not to make it spicy. Guess I'll have to try again. So, definitely more dishes I need to try. For now, I am happy that there's an authentic sichuan food place in Phoenix and not just the lame old American Chinese that are so totally boring. I am so very disappointed that the Shanghai place next to Golden Buddha has changed owner and they no longer have the special Shanghai menu and the quality of the food has gone down the drain.  Update: Tried the water boiled pork. That I thought was pretty good. The meat was nice and tender. The sichuan peppercorn made everything taste lemony to me later on, including the water. I guess that must be the numbing effect people talk about. I also liked the beef with jalapeno pepper. Nice flavor. And I still really like the twice cooked pork.  I think the restaurant would be better served if they got some more comfortable chairs instead of the unpadded straight back wooden wobbly chairs they have now.

Tired of your typical sushi joints? Want some authentic Japanese home cooking. This place is it! I always wondered what this place is. Figured it's another one of those rice bowl fast food joints from outside appears. We always joked around that it's a yakusa front since the lot is mostly always empty. After reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. I definitely think I will go back and try more stuff.  The inside is simple, and clean. Was greeted by the owner. This is a husband/wife joint owned by this old couple. As soon as I saw ramen I had to try it. It's almost impossible to find a ramen place in Phoenix every since the awesome ramen shop owned by this pair of Japanese brothers in Chandler (or was that Tempe) closed down ten years ago. I ordered the tonkatsu based ramen. The soup was yummy and flavorful. Very umami. So good! The only thing I'd like is a bit more meat. What can you say, I'm a carnivore. All in all very good. There is a wide selection of udon and various other items. I'm looking forward to go back and trying other things.   And as for the viewers that dissed on the old man. He was not as awful as the reviewer described. Maybe I was anticipating some grumpy old man. But he was rather pleasant. And his wife was like the nicest person ever! They both came out and greeted us when food was served.  I'm not ready yet to present the 5 stars until I try more items. :)

If I can give this place a zero star I would. The worst service ever in my entire dining experience. We showed up Friday night and they are semi busy. We were immediately seated. However, it took an unreasonably long time before a wait staff came by to get our drink order and it ended up being the "host". Then it took a while before the waitress came by and took our order. We were told that they are out of salmon. Ok no problem. We ordered some sushi. After quite a wait, we received 2 of our 4 items. It was ok, nothing exceptional. Then came the long wait. Finally the "host" came by and tells us that they are out of eel. Uh....shouldn't they know before we put in the order? However, he had no clue we had another order as well. We asked what about our other sushi order. He went checked, came back and told us they are out of snow crab also. So we said, ok then can we please have our check please since they have nothing to eat. The guy just disappeared and no where to be found. At the same time we never see our waitress again that night. After we waited, and waited, and waited, we finally saw him reemerge from the back. The entire time we didn't see any other wait staff in the front part of the restaurant. He's still completely oblivious. We had to waive him down and gave him the evil eye. He didn't even acknowledge us. And finally after he ducks in the back again he came back with the check. What a nightmare experience. Plus, we don't even really know how they foods are since they have absolutely nothing.... Will never ever go back again. Never had service this awful!

Went there for lunch buffet once. A cockroach was crawling on the side of the table cover I was sitting with a friend at. That's all I have to say....

Went there Saturday afternoon for lunch. We were quickly seated. I was thankful that it was not packed with lines like some of the reviews implied. I think maybe the downtown parade had something to do with it. Phew! Ordered the Lolo's chicken and waffles. Came with a breast, a wing, and a thigh. The skin was crunchy and yummy, a tad on the greasy side but still very good. The waffles with butter and syrup was very yummy. Although I think I expected more waffle/crunchy texture and not as more like pancake type of soft texture. But it's still good. I'd definitely go back! I still liked Roy Rogers fried chicken from the east coast way back when the best in my distorted and disillusioned memory. But this chicken is definitely very good.

Went there later one of the weekend nights. The ambiance seems good for friends get together or even family eating. I ordered the Chile Releno stuffed with pork since this place seems to specialize in green chile. And let me say it was amazingly good. I am hooked! A friend ordered the pork shank. It was a bit strange since it's more Italian than new mexican the way it was made. But, it's still tender and yummy. I'll definitely have to go back and try some more things on the menu. But I like!

The service was absolutely horrid. The waitress disappears for ludicrous periods of time. It took us almost an hour just to get water. When we finally got food, it was average at best and way over priced. On top of insult to injury, our group was charged 18% gratuity for the awful service. Our group got there around 7pm, and we didn't get to leave until 1030. We finally had to go track down the waitress to get our bill. I don't recommend going there. Typical overrated Scottsdale eatery.

I've been here many times since I moved down here 10+ years ago. I really like this place. I'd say the BBQ is above average, and thus the 4 stars. But the service is friendly and the atmosphere is homey. I like their ribs but it can be a tad dry at times. Maybe I like them meatier. I swear they used to give you 3 ribs, but now 2. The pulled pork is pretty good. I think I like my brisket fattier. Otherwise it's too dry. The hotlinks are pretty good. Love their cheesy potatoes and pit beans. I think they have the best bbq sauce anywhere. Yep, I think that's why I really like Joe's. They are fairly close and they have awesome bbq sauce. As far as the actual meat goes, I like them, but I like Stacy's smokehouse better. :) Only wish Joe's have beef ribs.....

Well, it used to be Long Horn steak house. So hey new Mexican place. Tried it out for dinner the other night. The menu is pretty much what you expect from typical Mexican joint. Nothing interesting besides your typical Mexican fare. Got the complementary chips. They are alright, on the salty side. I ordered a dish of pork with green chile (the name escapes me at the moment). It came with soup. Your standard veggie soup really. Whoa, horribly over salted. Same comment from the gf. With my entree it's not bad, and once again OVER SALTED. It's like the cook over salts every single item on the menu! OMG! And I love salty food! I crave salt! I typically eat stuff more saltier than most people. But yikes! I couldn't even take that! They need to fix that ASAP. A lot less salt and it'll be an OK Mexican place. I think I'll go to Abuelo's instead.

So after reading all the great reviews on yelp I was excited! I used to love the Peruvian place on Dobson/Warner next to C-Fu. They moved to Mesa, and then they closed down. I went to some other Peruvian place near by and for the first time I actually ate food from a restaurant that really want to make me gag. Ok going off tangent.... So here comes Contigo Peru. Fairly close to where I live and good reviews. The short version is, awful service on the part of OUR waitress and their food is mostly meh. 3 of us showed up at the restaurant and was seated promptly by a friendly staff. Ok so far so good.... Waited, and waited a bit before we get our menus. Waited, and waited a bit longer for the waitress to get our drink orders. BUT, she only took our drink orders and didn't ask if we wanted any starters. So we waited and waited some more and finally got our drinks and she asked if we want starters. We ordered the fried calamari. BUT, the waitress didn't ask if we are ready to order. So waited, and waited, and waited, finally I had to signal another waitress to get our waitress so we can orders in. We waited and waited and waited some more. I think about half an hour later, our calamari showed up. Oh yeah, looks like frozen calamari out of a bag. They where the little rings. No tentacles or anything. Heck, the calamari from Macaroni Grill was 10x better! Not only that, they were served with generic tartar sauce. The rings tasted like rubber bands. Chewy and tasteless. So we waited and waited some more and finally about another 30mins my gf's Pescado al Ajo came out. It's a battered a friend fish topped with butter and garlic. Smells good, looks good, but WTF are mine and my friend's dishes? Waited and waited and waited. Ok, do people not understand you serve all your dishes at a table at the same time? We are just joking about how Gordon Ramsey would be screaming and swearing back in the kitchen by now. So after a long wait, and after inquiring with the waitress, our dishes came out. I ordered the Lomo Saltado, and my friend ordered the  Tallarin Saltado de Carne, which essentially is just the same as my dish except with spaghetti instead of rice. My dish is a stirfry of fries (yes really fries you can get at the grocer's frozen section), onions, beef strips, and tomato in a soy sauce. This dish used to be my favorite. Well, all I can say is I have had much better and much flavorful than what I got. Just a note, it seems that Peruvian stir fry, they don't fully cook the veggies. Of all the places I have had this dish, the veggies are always half cooked. Just so people don't get surprised. Anyhow, their only saving grace was the fish. It was tender, flaky, and pretty good. Unfortunately, the breading for the fish was a soggy mush mess. But the fish itself was quite good. So this ENTIRE time, that waitress has not came by ONCE to check and see how we are doing. Thankfully the owner/manager (?) did once. From what we have observed, it seems that we just happen to got the worst waitress ever. Because the other waitress was attentive and people got their food fast. Heck, even people arrived after us and ordered after us got their food WAY before us with that better waitress. We suspect this particular waitress has no clue how to wait on tables and most likely messed up our order tickets or something. So....if your are lucky and got the good waitress, maybe you'll have a great experience. We....had no such luck. Consider their food is kinda meh compare to other Peruvian places I've tried, I think I'm going to pass on going back fearing to meet the inattentive waitress again. Honestly, she was really nice when she was present. She just needs to go to waitressing school or something.....

I have waited 12 freaking years for a Jimmy Johns to show up in Phoenix! Finally! Once I had somebody hand carry it down from Chicago, and the other time I drove 2 hours down to Tucson for it. Ok so I'm a little nuts over JJs. The Italian club is awesome and the Hunter's Club is just as good. The bread is just so good. Subway bread is absolute crap compare to this. Not sure why people are whining about the price. $5.25 for a large sub and $4.25 for a small club. That's pretty dang good for this day and age. Highly recommend the Italian. It is so good! If you'd rather go to subway, you have no taste buds.

Went there for lunch. Only tried their ramen. Disappointed that they don't have tonkatsu ramen. but what I got was really good! I'd say way better than the Ramen Republic. Better broth, better stuff in it, and it's not extra for all the stuff in there. I'll go back!

Visited this place about brunch time one Saturday. It's somewhere in Chandler downtown. We parked along side Oregon St and walked through this alley like opening from the street. The outside appearance won't knock you over. As soon as you walk into the court yard it's a completely different world. Full of plants and great patio dining. We opted to sit inside since there were seatings immediately available. But next time I would definitely vote for patio seating. The wait staff were friendly and the service was good. I ordered the Hearty Skillet. The best part was the flakey and buttery biscuit crumble. They were heavenly! I'd say one of the best breakfast I've ever had! Will definitely be coming back again. A great place to relax and have breakfast or brunch and lazy away a weekend morning!

So where to begin. It's a small place that's your typical hole in the wall setting, but clean. Pictures hung on the walls provides some ideas of what the dishes look like. Those of you that are used to Panda Express, PF Chang, or your typical American Chinese food or whatever New York Chinese food are, you won't find anything familiar. This is a place that specializes in northern Chinese food. This means noodles, dumplings, buns, and lots of wheat based products. The place should get an extra star for not having beef and broccoli on their menu. I mean seriously there is no broccoli in China until the recent decade. Beef and broccoli IS NOT Chinese food! The menu certainly brings back childhood memories. This is authentic northern China home cooking people! I do see some Sichuan dishes and I'm curious to try.   Went with couple co-workers for lunch to check the place out. I ordered the dumplings and the meat pie. The woman that owns the place was extremely nice. The service was above average. She brought out the corn based congee, which I'm assuming comes free with the meal. It's pretty much flavorless but easily fixed by putting in some soy sauce. I'm assuming that's how they are served authentically. The dumplings are ok and could used some additional seasoning. But they aren't super doughy like other Chinese places. I liked the meat pie. It was hot, juicy, and yummy. I can certainly say it was filling and I was stuffed. I'm definitely going back and try out some of the stirfry dishes. Haven't had those for eons and I really hope they live up to expectation. When it comes down to it, it's home cooking. You aren't going to find it superbly amazing like a 4 star restaurant and this is no Imperial cooking, but they are hearty and filling at a decent price. Until I try their other dishes, they'll get 4 stars because the memories made me happy, the service was good, and the food wasn't half bad. :) I really hope they would maybe offer the pork and veggie bao. That would just put it over the top.

The worst BBQ I've ever had! When we showed up we asked if the ribs are beef ribs or pork ribs since this place advertises Texas it has to be beef ribs right? The 20 something cashier didn't have a clue, and he had to ask the kitchen. I mean really shouldn't you know if you work there??? It was pork ribs, which is fine. So I ordered the 2 meat with brisket and pork ribs. The brisket was bone dry and the portion was small. There were like 4 pieces of small slices. The ribs were even worse. It was so dry and tough, and I've had jerky that were more tender. For the price they are charging this is pretty awful. My gf is from Texas and with her liking the more lean brisket she wasn't even ok with it. Don't think I'm coming back. I seriously have no idea what these people are raving about with the 5 stars. Maybe they need to make a trip to Rudy's and see what Texas BBQ is actually suppose to be like!

We were going to dinner somewhere Saturday night and happen to see this place from the road. Quickly looked up Yelp and decided to give this place a try instead. A gastropub in Chandler. Intriguing! It's an interesting little place that seems nice. The crowd seems to be older for that night. Majority of the guests were in their 50-60s.   We saw pork belly on the yelp reviews but alas there weren't any when we went. We ordered the claim chowder and the bruschetta as apps. The chowder was nice but didn't stand out. I guess I should say it was pleasant. For the bruschetta we chose the goat cheese, the wild mushrooms, and the olives. We both really liked the goat cheese with the carmelized onions. Although both of us felt that it would be even better if the goat cheese was warm. I liked the mushrooms and my gf liked the olives.  For entree we picked the beef short ribs, the elk o'bucco, and the crab cakes. The crab cakes were seasoned well and very yummy. The Elk was very dry. It's definitely missing a component of fat to address the dryness. The short rib was much better texture wise. My gf and I both felt that the elk and the beef were vastly under seasoned and needed salt.   The service was pleasant and the place definitely has potential to be quite good. I'd say 3.5 stars but another half for potential.

This place opened on the day we went and I definitely would not go back unless there are serious changes. I understand it's a soft opening but they just don't seem to have their acts together at all. When we first arrived, there was no host greeting us. We stood around for a while until a waitress approached us. There is not a lot of room by the entrance and it's just badly setup. When we were finally seated, the seats were dirty and not wiped clean. The waitress approached us and handed us sheets of paper to check off what we want. So no taking orders. We ordered 3 bowls of ramen and a small order of takoyaki. The waitress did not verify our orders with us. After a LONG wait, we received 1 bowl of ramen. And then after a bit the second bowl. The takoyaki was no where to be seen. We see a group that sat down after us received their order of takoyaki. After a long while, we finally received the last bowl of ramen while we stared at our other two bowls the entire time. Shouldn't all the orders come out at the same time? We see another table starring at a single bowl of ramen and nothing else. The waitress tells me that appetizers take longer than ramen and thus come out later. Uh....ok.... They are appetizers for a reason.... Finally when we are almost done with the ramen we received our takoyaki but it was a large order rather than the small order we marked. Throughout all this, we had to ask for spoons, and then napkins. The waitress just seems to be totally green and has no clue what she's doing besides running around like a chicken with no head.  So onto the food. My daughter barely touched her miso chicken ramen. Says she does not like it at all. Too much miso. All the ramen bowls barely had any soup in them. I ordered the Nishikawa Black ramen. It had fairly good flavor but tasted super greasy. The pork included was pretty good. Not much else can be said. I've had way better takoyaki else where and the squid had a funny smell to it.  Needless to say it wasn't a pleasant experience and we probably won't be back. The waitress ended up writing the final amount for the meal on the ticket excluding any tip. I'm guessing they felt so embarrassed about everything they didn't even bother.
