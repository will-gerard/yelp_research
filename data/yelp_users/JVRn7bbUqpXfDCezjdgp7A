After dealing with years of crazed hype from family and friends alike, I finally caved a few weeks ago and grabbed a bite at Oregano's. Not a super huge lover of Italian, but this place may end up being a prime mover in changing my mind.  Grabbed a pretty late dinner with a few high school friends I hadn't seen in a while, and we had the place virtually to ourselves. Parsing through the menu, I could hear my mom's almost manic raving about their pizzas and quickly decided to go the way of pasta (sorry, mom). I shamelessly love quirky campy menu listings, so I was super pleased with the Alfredo the Dark for the quick chuckle and the spot-on quality. The kick of poblano went a long way in cementing this as easily one of my favorite pasta dishes in Phoenix. Chased this all down with a Manhattan and a heaping helping of Pizzookie.  Super solid meal overall. Finally starting to understand the rave reviews. Maybe next time I'll actually grab a slice.

For my 22nd birthday, my friends decided to give me the Mill experience that I missed out on after leaving the Valley for upstate NY for college. We used Zuma as the starting point and worked our way up from there.  Zuma is pretty tiny and cramped and basically served as the pregame to follow up our first pregame (a.k.a. power-chugging Jack at home). We bought a fleet of Capri Sun pitchers with one just for me. I was definitely not feeling the Zuma vibes that night and ditched the straw and poured the mix lip-first down my throat (the first of SEVERAL questionable decisions that night) so that we could promptly move on to the next bar.  This place felt divey without any of the divey charm and is sadly the only bar from that night that I can justifiably review entirely from memory. One of the few pluses though: the pitcher got the job done! Great birthday.

My very first dip into KBBQ was with CGJ, and I hadn't been back in years since its rebrand to OHYA til a few weeks back.  I am a walking social disaster and double-booked dinner plans with two separate groups of friends last night with OHYA being the first of two venues. Afraid to cancel on either, I sucked it up and tried to go for a lighter meal here. Aiming for the lighter bite was futile as I ended up grabbing a Caterpillar Roll, multiple bites of my friend's galbi, and waaaay too much banchan. That damned daikon always reels me in. Inevitably, I ended my meal way too full and had to mentally rally for the next dinner, at Oregano's, on the other side of town immediately after. Also the scent of marinated meat really stuck to my clothes and probably made for a strange and stark contrast for everyone within a 5 foot radius at an Italian place.  Overall, I was pretty pleased with my recent experience here. I've maybe been spoiled over the last few years with some more solidly stellar Korean places (in Rochester, of all places), but that's not to take away from OHYA's quality. The marinated meat options were as solid as I remember them being from days of CGJ yore, and the addition of a sushi portion to the menu while not particularly inspired was chill. VERY interested in the karaoke since I was short on time and didn't get a chance to make the push for it. Will definitely be coming back in the next few months.

I've been going to Mido since 2009 maybe, and I'm just now remembering to do our long-term relationship justice with a proper review. Whenever I think to grab a hometown bite, Mido immediately comes to mind.  Mido has really been there for my formative foodie years, seeing me grow from an unversed teenage eater with an unhealthy exclusive inclination towards Las Vegas rolls into a sashimi fiend that can pick up a table with a pair of chopsticks. In all seriousness though, Mido was my first introduction into AYCE sushi and is one of the very few places that I can frequent without a smidgen of regret. I haven't had a single bad experience here over the past few years and Pancho always puts out nothing but the best in quality.   If you're doing AYCE, come hungry. Delving in can almost feel like a strategy-based system ("How am I going to eat all of this? Will I need to go a pant size up after this meal? Do I have an extra hour to spare for the food coma that's sure to come?? Was I sent here by God to eat all of this food?"), but just grab your faves early on and pace yourself. The Dragon, Orange, and Pancho rolls are pretty standard in my orders and never fail to impress. Pancho's even sent us a boat of just sashimi on occasion which, while indulgent, has really solidified my love for all things sushi.  I'm surprised to be reading up on a few mixed reviews on this place, since I'd be hard pressed to find another place in the valley that offers a dining experience with the same quality in food and service as Mido. Most definitely in my top 5 favorite places in Zona, if not anywhere.

I absolutely love seeing a restaurant get better over the years, so you can imagine my disappointment in seeing one of my old faves gradually decline in quality.  Teharu may have been my very first sushi experience in the Greater Phoenix Area and the revolving bar novelty had me hooked immediately. The solid sushi quality and constant mission to make a plate stack reach the high heavens kept me coming back all through high school as a cheaper alternative to places like Mido. I'm talking near weekly visits -- would not be surprised if you could catch my ugly mug multiple times in the pictures of satisfied customers plastered on the walls.  During my recent visit to Teharu, I was surprised to find it busy as ever especially after hearing about it kind of drop the ball over the last four years. The revolving resto hype and novelty is definitely still reeling people in. After a solidly long wait to be seated, we grabbed a few passing plates to find that the sushi was indeed on the decline, a few rungs shy of mediocre. Definitely lacking in freshness, which is concerning considering we saw the plates hit the belts not 30 seconds before we nabbed them. We each had maybe 3 plates max before calling it quits and opting for a drive thru burger elsewhere to hold us over.  Holding out hope for some inspired culinary comeback story, but til then will probably aim to hit up the spread of other sushi joints in the Valley.

Had Sunday brunch at Postino and opted for outdoor seating. In line with my luck, it started drizzling about five minutes after we were seated. With no wind and adequate cover, the rain actually made for a pretty decent ambiance; still had the chance to enjoy the beautiful patio space in cool weather. Started off with a Butcher's Block. Solid. I went for the prosciutto with brie and fig jam on focaccia and it was easily one of the most solid sandwiches I've eaten. In typical brunch fashion, had a mimosa but switched gears soon after to grab a pitcher of Firestone myself. Was not disappointed. Overall, the food at Postino was super solid but I was more so sold on the great feel of the place.

Was a little sketched out trying to find the alley entrance. My immediate reaction(s): "Is this where Bruce Wayne lost his parents? Can three twenty-somethings muscle their way out of a mugging? Is this bar hip enough to offer artisanal pizza rolls as fare?"  After being briefly stopped by the doorman, all thanks to the curse of my boyish good looks, and one accidental tumble down a set of stairs later, I took my first step in and immediately found myself digging the feel of this place. The actual bar feels like a sleek and hip anachronism nestled in the bosom of a venue that almost boasts a kind of kitschy, divey Goodwill chic. Ended up going fairly light on my tab since I had gone in on a few drinks over dinner. Grabbed a Stella (tried and true) and was curious to try the McCain. I found out that night that I am NOT a fan of Mezcal. Even still, I fully appreciated Valley for crafting a drink that left the same unpalatable taste in my mouth that Arizona politics are typically prone to do.  Pool and darts available towards the back, as well as an assortment of games. We went for Uno. Loved the mix of music playing. Felt like the weirder side of my Spotify, and I was entirely into that. I'd definitely be interested to come back for a night of live music sometime soon. I've been nothing but glad to see all these great new places springing up in Phoenix; excited to pop in the next time I'm in town.
