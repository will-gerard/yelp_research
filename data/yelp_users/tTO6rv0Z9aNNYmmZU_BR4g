LOVE the veggie burger!!!  and I'm not a vegetarian.  It has a sweet soy glaze and does fall apart when you eat it so if that bothers you - don't order it.   I order veggie burgers to save on calories and for the "health" of it many times - but at Houston's it is a treat!  Yummy!  and the fries are awesome too!  Not sure what all the talk is regarding it being "pricey" - it's not fast food but it's certainly not expensive.  Moderately priced for sure.

Vista de la Montana of Surprise, Arizona perpetrates abuse of seniors. The management lures frail and gullible elderly and disabled persons into signing up with the promise of receiving over $1000 per month of VA benefits. Then they hold you hostage and tell you that you cannot move away from this awful place (even though you are on a month-to-month lease) until you receive an answer from the VA (which is often 8-12 months), effectively coercing you to stay a resident way longer than is wanted. What they don't tell you is that moving out does not jeopardize any potential VA benefit to be received and that staying here does not increase your chance of receiving a VA benefit! The management is untruthful and misleading seniors purposefully to boost the occupancy rolls. Reports have been made to the attorney general's office and VA compliance officer in August 2012! Stay away from this place!

I have been wanting to try Cowboy Ciao for a while now and finally happened to be in the area with my husband a couple weeks ago and decided to try. I am apparently in the minority here, but it was a major disappointment from a food standpoint.   We started with bruscetta which had way too much vinegar to the point where you could barely tell you were eating tomatoes. It was doused with so much oil and vinegar that the bread underneath was soggy within a couple of minutes of sitting there.   I had the espresso rubbed filet Mignon and asked for the "sauce" which the waitress said had allot of heat to it to be on the side so I could control the heat. Now, I appreciate some heat in my food and am no wimp but even without the sauce with the heat in it - this fillet had so much heat that I had to take a sip of water after each bite and could barely taste the fillet. It was awful. And the potatoes were slightly undercooked and not hot.   My husband had the short ribs which he said were OK but not outstanding or even memorable. We chose to skip desert. The presentation of the food was gorgeous, the place itself was cute and our waitress did a good job. It's possible we both just ordered the wrong thing for our tastes - but I'm not inspired to want to drop another $110 based on our experience. Arrowhead Grill in Glendale blows this away for this price point.

Best breakfast in Phoenix hands-down! Love, love, love the Chop and chick!  The pork chop is cooked perfectly.  First time ever I've had a pork chop cooked and seasoned perfectly that I didn't make myself :)

My husband and I tried St Francis for the first time yesterday afternoon.  We happened to get there during their happy hour menu - which is about half off of everything on the limited "happy hour" menu.  The ambiance was drew me in right away.  I love the brick walls and vine covered veranda.  I am a sucker for any Phoenix building that takes the time to create charm - major points for me - I tend to think Phx has a tendency to take the easy "bland" route when it comes to decorating most of the time. Not so here.  We started with the baked goat cheese which was fantastic.  We both had wine, also half off any glass.  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich which was by far the best chicken salad I've ever had.  I love that they created a nice twist by not smothering it in mayonnaise.  It was healthy and most importantly - delicious.  As a side I got the fingerling potatoes - good with a nice crust outside and sprinkled with Parmesan.    Husband ordered the burger and fries which was to die for.  The burger was juicy with bacon and an awesome buttermilk fried onion on top, Gruyere cheese, caramelized onion and brioche bun = amazing.  The fries were to die for.  We were planning on trying desert but were too full this time.  We will definitely be back - pleasantly surprised and happy to have found another gem in Phoenix!!

Sad to say I really did not enjoy this restaurant. I was very surprised that what I thought was a family run Mexican restaurant served bottled salsa with chips. The chips tasted store bought and the salsa was served on a plate, making it difficult to eat at all. That was not a good start.   The food just has a very "frozen foodish" quality to me. I want my Mexican food fresh and flavorful. This just didn't do it for me. But then I really don't like Macayos either - so if you like Macayos you may like this. It's not for me at all. I won't be back.

I may have to try this again - haven't tried them since we moved here about 4 years ago.  HATED it.  Bread was chewey and the cheese tasted like rubber.  Just not good for me.  But then we are both pizza snobs.  My husband thinks it's passable - but if I'm going to eat the calories I want awesome pie.  Since so many seem to love it I may give another chance, but based on several inital tries they are "Lucky" to even get 2 stars from me unti proven otherwise...stay tuned.

I LOVE this restaurant and we go there at least 2-3 times a month. Surprise needs a family-owned restaurant that is affordable and has great food - and this one fits the bill.   I have tried other Greek places in the west valley and never returned to any of them - I had given up on Greek food fantasies until we discovered My Greek Corner.   My absolute favorite that I get almost every time we go is the lamb souvlaki. It's amazing. Perfectly spiced and perfectly cooked every time. The salad is always fresh and the pita bread is the freshest I've had since moving to AZ 5years ago. We also love the spanikopita and tirokopita - both fabulous.  Also as a bonus the prices are incredibly reasonable and the portions are huge.  And I love that it is not a chain, people in AZ are so into chain restaurants it's a breath of fresh air.  Especially in the West valley.  Love it!!

Yuk. Sorry but the food was awful. Tried Nicks three times now & won't be back. The service was really bad too. I really wanted to like this as it's so close to my house.

I gave Fast Track full points because of the very cheap rates and excellent customer service. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. They literally pick you up and take you to your car versus making you drag your luggage around the parking lot in 110 degree heat looking for your spot - which I liked allot. The bus that takes you to the airport also drives over to your car to pick you up which I thought was also nice.   As far as the rates, a tip:  Go directly to their website for cheaper rates. We originally scheduled through some other website and paid an extra $3 per day. Still reasonable, but one of the staff members let us know that we could save a bit by going directly to the site.   Thought it was great! would definitely use again!

Had a bad experience here. Firstly, I ordered the pizza which looked fantastic but had zero flavor. Zero. There was literally no flavor. I very nicely said this to the waitress when she asked. I was offered something else so I ordered gnocchi which was good. The sauce was underwhelming but not bad. My husband got steak which was cut in medallions. It was good, nice flavor and cooked just right. Pricey for the portion but good. Would order again good. Here's the rub; I would have been willing to try Amaro again had it not been for the classless way the owner handled the fact that I didn't care for the pizza. She came to the table for all of 3 seconds and then charged us $8.00 for the pizza because we "ate a piece."  Given that I didn't ask to replace the pizza and was never told about the charge until the bill came it just hit me as rude. I paid $8 for one PC of flavorless pizza. And the general attitude shift after I was honest about not liking it. And btw I was nice about it. Really nice about it because it was just bland for me. Someone else may like it just fine. It's not so much the money as the rude service. I don't mind paying for a nice meal. But part of that is service. Can't support this place.

My husband and I are regulars to Saigon Kitchen.  The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is clean and modern.  We both love the carmelized salmon - it is absolutely to die for.  You get a generous serving of salmon in a delicious sauce, cooked in a clay pot.  The meal comes with soup, salad, and rice and we always end up bringing some home.  It's unique and a great addition to Surprise!  Try it - you'll love it.
