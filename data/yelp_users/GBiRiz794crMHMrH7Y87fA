This place is a kick ass little corner bar. Lots of TVs with sporting events and great people. I definitely recommend going and checking it out once their patio is done being built. Drinks are potent and service is the best. This IS the mini version of a Cheers in Arizona.

This place is ALWAYS packed and they seem to cycle through the orders VERY fast! Very tasty bagels and breakfast burritos. Home cooked taste to the breakfast platters. HUGE variety of drinks.  100% recommended.

Incredible. We actually were 100% fine with waiting for an hour for a chance to experience this place. It opens at 5pm and you better get there at 3:30p or 4p to ensure you get in during the first round of seating.  I have been to Italy. 5 different cities. This pizza and atmosphere were as close as I have gotten while in the states. They have a decent wine selection and an authentic cappuccino.  Not only would I recommend this place to EVERYONE I know, I will be going back OFTEN.  Worth the drive. Worth the wait. Worth the price. Worth the food.  DO IT.

Excellent. We eat here almost every weekend. Simple reasons...  The food is WONDERFUL. Like most mexican food places, the plates are huge and the food is scaulding hot when it arrives, but the food seems to be a notch above most places we have eaten.  The drinks are abundant and you can order everything from small margaritas to SUPER HUGE get-you-drunk FAST margaritas. I am a White Russian enthusiast, and they have one of the best I have ever had.  The wait service is prompt and polite. The management is great. This guy made me a White Russian with half and half instead of milk and it was the best thing ever! Now every time we go back the manager makes me my drink:) Incredible customer care.  I disagree with previous comments about the Guacamole. Its alive and tasty. We order a side of it with our chips and salsa every time we visit.  I would HIGHLY recommend this place.

Granted, we visited this location only a few months after it opened. But the salad bar was filthy and the lettuce was wilted. The pizza was undercooked and the sauce was THICK. I mean THICK. Like they dumped two cups of tomato sauce on this pie before cooking it for 5 minutes! The abundant sauce was nothing special either. It tasted like it was straight out of a can from Walmart.  The ONLY reason I gave this place a second star was the service. The owner was there and seemed very vested and proud of the place and the kids working there were definitely attentive to service needs.  I am sure its better now otherwise they wouldn't have survived a couple years performing like they did during our visit.  I would only recommend this if you were out for a "test" night.
