My first review of China Chili was 4 stars. After today's experience I am down to 1 star. I had Kung Pao Chicken and my wife had Lemon Chicken. I like it spicey but this was just sour. I had to leave it. My wife enjoyed her Lemon Chicken but 1 1/2 hours later became sick to her stomach. I wonder if anyone else had a similar experience there today. We have been there several times and were always pleased with everything. This was the first time we had this type of experience. Service was good, food was not.

We have seen Aida on three occasions, once several years ago in Phoenix, once in Prague and yesterday again in Phoenix. My wife and I both agreed, this was the best performance we have seem so far of this wonderful opera. One thing we left with... we hope we get to see it again and we hope when that time comes, we will enjoy it as much as yesterday. We will continue to support Arizona Opera and hope others do as well. The performances are outstanding. Keep up the good work!!!!

Bravo! Lucia di Lammermoor. If you enjoy opera, don't miss this wonderful performance put on by the Arizona Opera. This was my first "Lucia" and it greatly surpassed my expectations. It is definitely an opera I would enjoy again. We are so fortunate to have this available to us here in Phoenix. We flew out to LA to see La Boheme a few months ago and my wife and I both agreed that LA Opera doesn't have anything over the Arizona Opera. Keep up the good work folks!

La Boheme  was excellent. For all we had to go through to see La Boheme in LA  (traffic) I will take AZ Opera any day. Symphony Hall is a much nicer venue than the LA Opera (smaller and more aisles!). If only the downtown restaurants like the "Butcher" were open on Sundays... We could include a nice lunch with a Sunday matinee. Opera has been enduring for a long time. It touches the soul. I wish we had more young people that were willing to give it a try. Support your AZ Opera. It's one of the best deals in town!

Had lunch today... wonderful crepes stuffed with filet mignon. Nice wine selection and service was terrific. We didn't need it, but couldn't leave without trying the lemon creme brulee. Wonderful! Very nice casual atmosphere. The food poisoning review is shocking. If you don't hear from me our crepes "stayed down" just fine:)

Wow, I was shocked to see some of the mediocre and poor reviews for this location. We went there for the first time today and had good service and food. I had the Pad Thai which I really enjoyed. Susan had some kind of peanut sauce rice thingy that she gobbled down with no problem. Flavor? Plenty enough for me and I ordered "medium." The little bowl of soup offered as an appetizer was a nice touch too. We both really enjoyed our lunch experience but maybe we are not the Thai food aficionados some of the other yelpers are.

Ever decide to "pass" on dinner and just go out and find a good dish of frozen yogurt? This is now where we like to go. Some yogurt places have gotten expensive for what you get... not this place. Agree wholeheartedly with other yelpers about the creaminess of their product. Low in calories, terrific taste and not too expensive. What else could you ask for?  It would be nice if they took credit cards but they would probably have to charge more for their yogurt to pay "the system."  Of course, it would be nice if they were located at the corner of Elliot and Higly too:)

Really good pizza... we have not tried the other menu items yet. It appears the place is a hangout for a lot of regulars. That says something about the food. Service was fine.  Only issue was people going outside the front door and smoking on the patio (close to the door). I didn't think this was permitted.

First time at the Mint Thai Cafe tonight. Service was exceptional and food was very good. Had the Pad Thai Noodles and Susan had the Rice Down Under. We both enjoyed what we had and have enough left over for tomorrow. Had to save some room to try a dessert so we gave the Sticky Rice with Mango a try. The dessert was terrific! Always like to try new things. We will likely return.

We enjoy Einsteins bagels and coffee. Unfortunately this one is not well maintained or staffed. Men's restroom is always a mess, broken towel dispenser for weeks. Employees come in late an nobody seems to care. Frequently understaffed. Too bad. Bagels and coffee continue to be good.

Here's my gripe... they send you all these coupons for drastic savings and make you think you are really getting a good deal. That's their business strategy.  OK, lets talk men's briefs. I received a 30% off mailer that I planned to buy a four pack of men's briefs with till I saw the regular price marked at $34. That's $23.80... still more than I thought four men's briefs were worth. I then went to Walmart, got the same brand in a five pack for $13.50.   I'm not saying there are not some good deals at Kohls but be careful. It looks like they are making up the for the good deals on other merchandise.

I've been to the Liberty Market 4 or 5 times. Yesterday I had the Picnic sandwich... delicious! Some folks might like the sweet potato salad. I thought it was just  "OK". probably would get a different side next time like the corn/tomato/bean salad that Susan got. Liberty is one of the establishments that makes downtown Gilbert "cool".  Service is good and atmosphere is nice. This is not a dinner place for that special occasion, more like a high class cafeteria. Thanks Joe Johnson, for your vision for downtown Gilbert! Why not 5 stars? I can get a terrific glass of wine across the street at Postino's for five bucks or go next door to Oregano's and Susan and I share a $9 salad and are "stuffed."  Prices at Liberty are a little steep compared to the neighbors. It does offer variety to downtown Gilbert's foodie menu and we will definitely return, especially to use the bathrooms that are another subject for another day:)

We have enjoyed Ted's on many, many occasions over the years and continue to stop by when in the mood. Hot dogs are consistently above the norm. There are other variations in the Valley that are also very good but Ted's has its own unique flavor and texture. Prices are fair and the ambiance is "old school." Don't expect to be waited on but the staff is always courteous. I like the all beef with mustard, onion and pickle. How much more "all American hot dog" can you get? Some places use gimmicks and bizarre hot dog creations to attract. You won't find those at Ted's. We enjoyed Ted's again this week and the reason I am not giving 5 stars is their onion rings seem to have become a bag full of little crunchy things lately. Years ago they were large, juicy rings with a tasty batter. Our recent experiences with them have been a little disappointing... too many little crunchies. We will continue to patronize when in the mood.

Lunch for two at Toscana. We both had the Carbonara and shared a nice bottle of Primativo. Service was exceptional. The beans that come with the bread are very good. The Carbonara was good but I make it better. I like bacon in my Carbonara instead of ham. The waiter was nice enough to provide us with a bottle of the wine that was a special and it was very nice. Most wines carried the typical restaurant level prices (a little high).

Good food but sad service. Stopped here for lunch today before the opera. I can't fault the server but it took us 40 minutes to get served. They need more cooks or something. What would have been a special afternoon turned out to us having to "woof" our food down to get across the street to the opera on time. Too bad. My Reuben was pretty tasty and Susan liked her fish sandwich too. We have been here many times but this was not a good experience.

Wow... never knew this place was here. Super wine list. Try the Pinot Nero. Menu has a wide selection. We had the bolognese and the spinach ravioli. Both were well done. Anxious to try some of the things on the menu with capers and anchovies. Good selection of deserts and it's right next to an Italian grocer/gelato shop. Who needs to go to Italy? Oh yes, the service was very good too.

Fred tuned my piano today. It has not been tuned in almost three years since I purchased it new. I had no idea how much out of tune it really was. Not only did Fred make my piano sound better than ever he gave me some pointers on how to take care of the piano I was not aware of. Fred gave my three year old Albert Weber a checkup and found a cracked soundboard (to my great surprise). Fortunately, I guess the location and type of crack is fairly common in AZ due to the dryness and it is not affecting the sound. Fred eased my concern considerably when he explained how it can be repaired (if I wished to do so). I guess if I ever want to trade it in on a Steinway I will have it fixed. In the mean time it sounds great thanks to Fred. It was obvious to me I had found the right person to take care of my piano.

Always good! We love this place. Try the sweet potato ravioli. Wonderful Italian wines. The lemoncello dessert is marvelous. Service is great. We also like the ambiance... cozy, quiet music that matches the cuisine. I hate going to an Italian restaurant and hearing rock and roll or country western in the background. We have visited many times and have never been disappointed.

Tried the red pepper, capers and black olive pizza today. Probably one of the best pizzas we have ever had, including several in Italy. This place is consistently good. Never had an entree, desert or vino we did not thoroughly enjoy. Service is always top notch! Prices are reasonable too. We keep going back

We have been here several times which normally means we like it. We went for breakfast today and were very disappointed. Ordered a spinach & mushroom griddle only to get a heaping pile of potatoes and cheese with maybe three little strands of spinach and a few small thin slices of mushrooms. The eggs were just slightly above room temperature so it means the plate was sitting somewhere awhile. Service was friendly but I don't consider bringing cold food good service. Two pieces of toast had so much butter in the middle it had soaked completely through the bottom pieces making them uneatable. Needless to say, I did not finish the huge pile of potatoes and left wondering what was going on at Brunchies???

Quality work and quality service. Jack's shop recently upgraded my IMS bearing on my 996, along with a new clutch,RMS, and spark plug cable tubes. I was very happy with the service and the fact I was able to stop by and see everything apart. I also think Jack is as concerned about how much you are spending on your project as you are. I will be one of Stuttgart Southwest's repeat customers from now on.

Really liked this place. Nothing like fresh candy and what a variety! Not cheap but nothing is anymore. Loved the sea salt chocolate. Funny to see everyone walking out with their little bags. Almost impossible to visit and not leave with a pound of wonderful candy. Take the kids!

OK, drove all the way from Gilbert to Camelback because the Phoenix Magazine rated Delux as one of the best burgers in the Valley. Two burgers, one mixed fries, one lemonade, one Diet Coke and tip came to $39. Fries were very good but because of the poor service it's hard to say how good our cold burgers were. Susan had to ask one of the other servers where our order was because we didn't see our waiter... everyone around us was getting served and they ordered after us. Too bad, we probably won't go back because of the service. I'm sure if they could make all the pieces fit together the place would be great. Just don't want to pay almost $40 for a couple burgers and take that chance again. We'll go to Burger King or McDonald's where we know what to expect.

Very good service and food was terrific. We had the vegetable egg foo young and the moo shu chicken. A little pricey but the atmosphere is definitely a notch above most Phx Chinese restaurants. We went to the new location just off of Pima Rd and Pinnacle Peak Parkway. We will go back.

Probably our favorite Mexican food restaurant in the SE Valley. The salsas are both fantastic. The shrimp tacos are great! Our problem is when we find something we really like (like the shrimp tacos) we seldom try the other items on the menu when we return. Some places we keep returning to. This is one of them. Some we never go back.

Lunch at Cibo today. I was looking for a good pizza and Cibo came up under the top pizzas in Phx. It's been a few years since I was there and that was only to stop by for a drink. Wow, they seem to have expanded. Very nice atmosphere. Nice place to eat outside. It really wasn't pizza... More like a pocket pizza or almost a calzone. Regardless, they have a nice menu variety, reasonable wines, and the desserts look terrific (did not try). This place may move up to 5 stars after my next visit. The fact that I say "next visit" should tell you something. We really liked this place. Parking is in the street with high curbs. Watch for door scrapes unless you are driving a truck or an SUV.

I have only found two BBQ places in the Phoenix area that I consider "go back" places. They are Joe's BBQ and another large chain I won't mention here. Joe's definitely has the country, homey atmosphere and is always good. You get kind of a warm, fuzzy feeling eating there, especially with the farm tractor inside the restaurant. The BBQ beans are something special. Try the home made root beer.

First time at Haus Murphey's and super impressed. Best German food since Germany. Had the paprika schnitzel and wife had the spicy bratwurst. Naturally we had to have a German beer too. Too bad we live in the SE Valley and it's a trek to get there or we would be there more often.

We kept passing by this place. Last night a friend raved about it so we tried it for lunch today. First try was limited to gyros and dolmades. Probably the biggest gyro I have ever had with very tender meat... nice. Dolmades were great. Service was very good. Layout seems a little strange. We were not sure where to go when we walked in. The tables all had numbers on them so we didn't know whether they were taken or not? Hostess stand was all the way on the opposite of the room from the entry door. BUT, the food was really good. We are anxious to try some of the other things on the menu. Waiting to try the baklava we brought home:)

Tarbell's is one off the best restaurants in the Phoenix area. Yes, it's a little pricey but I was impressed when our waiter could tell us all the ingredients in a particular menu item when asked... and there were quite a few! I had the scotch beef and my wife had the scallops. Our friends had the trout and spaghetti. The garbanzo bean appetizer is a wonderful. The wine list is spectacular.  Our real treat was the bing cherry desert. I'm not usually a big fan of cherries but this was marvelous. Our overall experience was one of the better fine dining experiences we have had in a long time. Too bad they are not open for lunch. If you know of a better place than this for fine dining please advise

It's really hard to beat the food quality, service, and value you get at Oregano's. Susan and I patronized the Flagstaff location weekly for years and now we are fortunate enough to live in Gilbert and have the Gilbert restaurant to visit. A little wait sometimes is part of the experience that makes it worth while... you wouldn't be waiting if it wasn't good. The salads are probably our favorites. Always enough for two people to share. Try the Italian Wedding Soup... supurb! Good job Oregano's!

Susan and I went there for lunch today to try someplace different. We were very impressed. We both had the stuffed meatloaf and would definitely go back for it again. Service was terrific. Prices are reasonable. The wine selection could use some improvement or I would be giving it 5 stars. The building is really neat and seems to attract a lot of seniors. We didn't try the famous "salad room" but it looked like almost everyone else was.

I don't know why it took us so long to hear about this place. Our lunch today was some of the best Chinese food we have had in a long time. The orange chicken and spicy chicken dumplings were superb!!! I shouldn't say this, but they need to raise their prices. This is probably the best deal in town as far as authentic Chinese food goes. Can't wait to go back and try something else.

We were supposed to be in Venice, Italy today. We had to cancel our trip. Went to Andreoli for lunch instead and were not disappointed. Do not expect a fancy Italian restaurant. Do expect a fabulous assortment of pastries, sandwiches and pasta dishes. Nice selection of wines and beers in a venue that has the feel of a corner shop in Italy. My wife had the homemade sausage sandwich and I had the "Bastardo." We are going back next week to continue our new quest of trying everything Andreoli has to offer.  Expect to hear a lot of locals speaking Italian but we got by very well using English:)  A little pricey but no where near the cost of a trip to the "boot."

Yes, as good as it gets in the metro area. I had the best corned beef sandwich I have ever had. Wifey had the meatloaf sandwich and loved it. Nice selection of wines. Good service, friendly atmosphere. A little pricey, but you usually get what you pay for. After coming here we really want to try the mother restaurant, Binkley's.

Back again for the second time last Sunday with friends. This time I had the corned beef sandwich and Susan the eggs benedict. EXCELLENT. We did not need the order of fries served with three sauces... just too much to eat. The fries are magnificent and served the french way in the little paper cone. The sauces were good but I usually like a little more flavor. Really, the fries don't need sauces. They stand on their own due to the way they are cooked. My friend had the eggs benedict and said they were the best he has ever had. Service has been terrific both times we visited Cafe Bink. We didn't need the second bottle of wine either but it was terrific.

Two cups of coffee and two pieces of cheesecake well over $20. Give me a break! I could have bought a whole cheesecake for less than that. Service was good. Too much whipped cream. Silverware was full of spots from the dishwasher. Next time I will just eat at home.

Lunch at La Calabria today... most excellent! Some of the best Italian food we have had in awhile. Service was terrific. I can't understand what prompts some of the comments about atmosphere. Maybe there has been some changes made since of the comments were made. The atmosphere was just fine for us. Just as good as some of the wonderful restaurants we have visited in Italy! If you are looking for vinyl booths to top off your dining experience I suggest Denny's.  We shall return (didn't a general say that in WWII?)  This place was recommended to us by a local restaurant manager and he did not let us down.

Good pie! We come here often and never have been disappointed. Nice crust and sauce. Enjoy pizza by the slice or the whole pie. The basic cheese pizza is our favorite. Like others, we have always had excellent service. I was surprised to see someone ran into a service issue as we have always been made to feel welcome and the staff has been eager to please. One of these days we will have to try something other than the pizza.

We have been going back to Casanova Bros. for years now. Cheese pizza and calzones are terrific. Service is some of the best in the Valley. My only regret is we keep getting the same thing because we enjoy it so much... we must sample some of the other menu items. Yes, there are two, maybe three other pizza places that are good in Gilbert. They are all different though. Easy, convenient access, and fast service here. Good family restaurant. They do not have alcohol and that doesn't seem to be hurting business.

There are only two places to get a really good hot dog in the Valley and this is one of them. Prices are reasonable and the variety of hot dogs is very good. Try starting out with the basic "snap dog." I like them with just mustard , onion and relish.  One of my problems is I find something I like at a restaurant and whenever I go back I order the same thing. The menu at Pttsburgh Willys offers a lot of variety. I have to try some different hot dogs.  And, I will :)

Gave the guy a $5 tip and he didn't even say thank you. The staff are not friendly at all and it sounds like all they are doing is arguing with one another in Chinese. Lemon chicken has too thick of a coating and the lemon sauce is bland. The pancakes for the Moo Shi are heavy like tortillas... what's with that?   The menu is very broad but our take home boxes never made it in the house.

Lunch here for the first time today. I am giving them four stars because their oysters were very good (sweet tasting), service and bread were good. I have had better ceviche and my seafood/rice thingy was a little too spicy (taste of Tabasco). My wife said she enjoyed her chowder so there is another positive. We will return for the oysters. I don't know where these came from but they were the best since visiting the oyster bar in Grand Central Station.

If you enjoy any kind of music you will love the MIM. They have done a terrific job providing the history and examples of almost any musical instrument you can imagine. And, as a bonus, you get to hear them being played in their original environment. They have a "hands on" section for the kids but this is really more of an adult museum. Most children wouldn't appreciate seeing John Lennon's piano that "Imagine" was composed or George Benson's guitar unless they can relate. For us old folks... this place is a little slice of music paradise that takes us back through time as well as an educational experience. The theater is also a terrific venue to see live performances. All the seats are great but some are surprisingly fantastic. I'm not telling which ones those are because I want them to be available next time I go. You will have to find them for yourself:)

Don't let them sell you something you don't need... they told me I needed rear brakes for almost $500. It didn't sound right to me. I only have 37k miles on the car so I said lets wait. I got home, took the rear wheel off and found much more brake pad than caliper. I still have plenty of miles to go. They never even looked at the amount of pad that was on the car.

Went to the Groves for the first time today for lunch. The breakfast crowd was just clearing out and it had been "packed." I could see why. They have a broad breakfast menu and the food they were delivering to the tables looked good. Large servings! Susan had a prime rib sandwich (also very large). Two people could easily share a sandwich. I had the mac & cheese to put them to my real test. Spicy because of the peppers, but very good. If you can handle the heat, you will like the mac & cheese. The portion was way too much for one person. We both took our dinner home in boxes.  Service was great. We want to try breakfast next. This was one of the restaurants on the TV show where they do undercover work to find out why they are not making money. It looks like they got their problem fixed.

Back for breakfast today and unfortunately The Groves did not exceed my expectations enough to get four stars again. The $3.95 breakfast sign in front is definitely a bait and switch tactic because there is only one item I saw on the menu for that price and the rest was pretty expensive for what you got, or at least as high as anywhere else (no deal here). French toast came with a ball of butter as big as a golf ball and a lot of powdered sugar with a sticky syrup container along side. Nothing special but it tasted ok.  Susan's omelet was pretty flavorless and the potatoes tasted like they had been fried in something strange or they were just starting to go bad. She told me "you wouldn't like this."  Our previous lunch was very good and we were looking forward to going back for breakfast. The waitress even said everyone comes in here for breakfast??? We must be missing something here. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things. Not sure about another visit. Too many other places that have proven to be consistently good.

Wonderful service and very good food. We had the Cubanos, plantains (both types) and Flan. The sandwiches are huge and you really get your money's worth here. Everything we had was superb and we can't wait to go back to try something different. The place is small and almost what I would call communal eating but that's part of the experience. Everyone in there was raving about what they had there were a couple of "regulars."

Wow! What a neat little place with extraordinary food. First of all, you better be good if you are going to "make it" next to Ted's hot dog restaurant. The Quebec Poutine is to die for. We could have made a meal out of it by itself. The addition of the malt vinegar gives it a flavor that really says "eat more of me." We each ordered a Tunbrodsrulle wrap which was a mistake because they are so big. They were delightful but we wound up taking one home for later. This is one of those places I couldn't wait to Yelp about. I can't wait to try some of the other dishes on the menu. Service is great, they make you feel welcome. Restaurant is very casual and I think they might but ready for prime time somewhere. This is one of those places where with the right location the sky's the limit. I have never been that big of a fan of Scandinavian food until now. Try this place!

Still get 5 stars. Went back again yesterday for some of that Poutine. Glllrrrbbbl. Had a hard time coming up for air once I started eating. Susan had 6 perogies and enjoyed. We love this place. They are planning to move in January or February to a new location in Mesa. Fortunately, they will be even closer to us :)  We really need to take some of our kids there so they can sample some of this Scandinavian/Canadian cuisine. Not cheap, but you get what you pay for. You can't find this stuff on Denny's menu (or any other local restaurant?).  Beaver Balls are next on my list to try.

Very good experience...good food, good service. Menu is a little limited and the prices high. Nice ambiance and very busy at lunch time. Overall, we liked it and may return. I had the pear and Gorgonzola flatbread that tasted excellent, but for $15 it wasn't enough to take any home. Wifey had a salad and said it was also very good. There are just a lot of really good places in Scottsdale so it needs to be really a standout to get 5 stars.

Location, location, location. Excellent service. My wife told the server how much she liked the salted caramel pudding and the chef came out and taught her how to make it! I have only had sandwiches here by they have been outstanding. Today I had the turkey pastrami, terrific! Prices are what you would expect to pay downtown at a good restaurant but the food and service keeps us coming back.

Hello La Petite France Bistro, goodbye Zinc Bistro!!!!! We loved La Petite France Bistro. This is the closest to real French food we have found in Scottsdale. The house wine was superb! Best crepes since Paris. If you can't work with the culture differences, and want fast service, go to a fast food joint, not a French restaurant.

OK, back again... this time we had the Salmon Flammekeuche and our favorite house wine, the Heritages Cotes Du Rhone. Excellent!!!  I really have a hard time with some of the negative comments about this place, especially about the service. We don't come here for the service, we come here for the food. It is wonderful and both times we have come here it has made us want to go back to France for another visit.   We absolutely love this place. If you are concerned about fast service and expect the owners to understand your English perfectly don't bother coming here. If you have traveled France, enjoyed it and like French food you won't be disappointed. Yes, you may have to remind the waiter if you are missing something and yes, you may have to ask for your check (L'addition, s'il vous plait).  We will return!

Susan and I went back for the second time today for Lunch. We don't go back to a place unless we really like the place (there is too much to choose from). Both of us are very impressed with the menu. Prices for Happy Hour drinks and snacks beat other places we have frequented. Service was terrific!  The meatloaf sandwich was great! Last time we had the Monte Cristo... also superb.  I'm sure we will return.

We have been here before and are a fan of Monte Cristo sandwiches so we decided to go for lunch today. The service and atmosphere was good. A few Chandler workers were having lunch but the place was not full by any means. The side potatoes were very good. But, the Monte Cristo had a funny flavor that both my wife and I picked up on. It was ok... but not something I would go back for. Something just tasted strange. It seemed overpriced too. We had two Monte Cristos and one iced tea. After the tip it was over $30. Too much for a couple sandwiches for lunch. I don't think we will go back..

Why 4-stars when there are so many mediocre reviews? We went there for lunch today with friends (Saturday). I think they open at 11 or 11:30 and we left a little before 2:00. We were the only ones there??? The service was excellent (the upside of being the only customers). We had the chicken pot pies and the chicken and dumplings. Both were terrific. The wines were great and reasonable. Frankly, I think this place would do better in a different location than a strip mall (parking isn't great) and they changed the name. I told the waiter I was giving them 5-stars but they were out of some of the menu items our friends wanted so I am backing down to 4. You can't sell it if you don't have it. Seems I learned that in business school or somewhere.

Not ready for prime time. This place needs alot of help. The tables were sticky, the servings small. The prices high. The food quality mediocre. Did not try the coffee... only the paninis. I think they will have a hard time competing with The Spot restaurant that is almost next door.

Food is 5 stars. I had the "hot mess" and it was terrific. Susan had steak & eggs... not a good choice when there are so many other exciting things on the menu. Only gave 4 stars because Susan's water glass had a milky film inside of it and when it was brought to the waiter's attention he replaced it but didn't seem to think it was a big deal. She also had to ask for a refill on her coffee. Other than that it was very good. The house bloody Mary's are really tasty and only $5.

Brussels and Breakfast for lunch. Excellent, but if you are hungry you may want to add something else. We really enjoy Gertrude's and the service is fantastic, especially if you go during non peak times. Nice wine selection, especially on "Wineday Wednesdays." Looking forward to cooler weather to be able to enjoy Gertrude's on the patio.

Sorry Gertrude's... seems they have a new chef and menu. The menu is not as unique as the old one. What happened to the "Hot Mess"? We went for lunch, the hostess seated us and said who would be taking care of us. Then a young lady brought menus and asked what we would like to drink so I ordered a glass of wine. Then another person came with my wine and took our menus. That was it. Nobody asked us what we wanted to order until I waved for some help and asked if someone could take our order. Now, they were not busy at all. Oh well, just a miscommunication I guess. I had the tuna sandwich and the fries were good. The sandwich was not up to my expectations. Something needs to change before I return. Too bad, I used to really like Gertrude's.

We all love Zoo Lights. But, what good would my comments be unless I tried to offer some things that could be improved on:) Wife and I went last night (Sunday) figuring it might be fewer people. SURPRISE! The place was packed.  1. They could use a few more turn styles or maybe open up another temporary entrance when so many people are trying to get in at 6:00 pm. Maybe even a better way to organize the line (ropes?) would help when it runs way out into the parking lot. It kind of turned into a mob. 2. Pedestrian traffic should be routed one-way through narrower trails such as the Arizona Trail. Some folks had strollers as big as golf carts and in the dark people were kind of running into one another. Might even consider this on the other routes, we certainly wouldn't want to discriminate against the monster strollers. 3. Over $7 for a bag of popcorn that is too big to eat? Gimme a break, offer a smaller size for those of us not feeding ten people. 4. What's with the sorcerer of witches displayed with lights? I thought this was Christmas/holiday time. My wife was a little taken back. Maybe we are moving toward a Fantasia theme?  Yes, we had a very good time and will continue to return every year. Keep up the good work Phoenix Zoo and I know you will continue to improve on the event each year.

East Valley, very good Italian food, very friendly and attentive customer service, nice selection of wines. Ok, now for the review. I had the manicotti and Susan had the antipasti. Both were very good and we are anxious to try something else on the menu. The bread is made by the chef and very good. They did not get 5 stars because I think the ambiance could be improved on. I have always heard when restaurants start painting advertising on their windows it means their business is slacking off. When we walked up I said uh oh... painting on the windows. Fortunately the pizza advertising didn't take away from our experience.

Wonderful pizza crust. We had the Holy Shitaki pizza. No regrets. Huge beer list and good service. This is the largest Mello I have ever been in. We had been to MMs out East and are happy to see them in the Valley. Good food and service is pretty normal with MMs so it's a matter of how well you like their pizza. Nice to have variety and MM gives us that.

This changes everything! They have an unbelievable menu here. My wife and I had  crepe items and both were excellent. The variety of crepe dishes and pancakes is the broadest I have seen. Atmosphere is typical Scottsdaleish. The service is better than it needs to be (don't need quite that much attention).  Portions are significant and prices are fair. The big question for us is whether it is worth the drive from Gilbert. Yes, it is!

Service was great. I had the strawberry fields pancakes and found them very enjoyable. My wife had the pot pie that used filo dough. It was very good although it could have been served a little warmer. The menu here offers some unique items. It is a little pricey but that doesn't seem to bother the crowd. We are looking forward to Snooze AM opening up in Gilbert. Two things kept it from getting 5 stars from me... the pot pie could have been warmer and prices are a tad high. We were pleased with our serving sizes for both items we ordered.

Very nice experience. Had dinner with friends last night. Definitely ordered too much food. Servings are generous. We had a fried Brie salad, bruschetta, escargot, salmon and pork entrees, and a chocolate soufflé. Everything was very good. Service was excellent. Wine selection very nice and reasonably priced. Like I indicated to the owner, I was expecting something good based on the previous reviews. Our visit exceeded my expectations. This place is not getting enough media hype! Only issues are they were out of Prosecco and the coffee machine was not working. I can take or leave the entertainment... usually not a big fan of local guitarists but at least they have tables available a good distance from the music. They take pride in being dog friendly and post photos of dogs that visit (dogs are allowed on the patio). Kind of cute. Overall... a place we will most likely return to.

Brunch today at the "Rail." Croque Madame for two with Bloody Mary's. Food was excellent. Service was excellent. Atmosphere was good. This is a place we will come back to. The menu is like being back in Charleston, SC.
