Let me start with the positive. The corn chicken soup was hot and the won ton chips were a nice addition to the soup. The chicken egg roll was very greasy. My main dish was the cashew chicken. It was white meat but had to pick through it to get a decent piece without icky's on it. The flavor was bland, so I decided to add chili paste. It was hot, but tasteless. It was on the way to downtown, but will note return here again. YUCK!!!

15 minutes to make an egg salad sandwich with only 4 orders ahead of me? When I open my bag, there is only half a sandwich? WTF? I go back and they acknowledge the mistake and proceed to make a half sandwich with and old piece of bread that was likely left over from lunch 5 hours prior.  There are too many places in this area to mess up that bad on a simple sandwich order to go back and try it again.

The area is sort of run down and the store looks to be in a similar state. Some Safeways are incredible, although expensive. Good thing we only needed a few items.   On a positve note, there were cart wipes which were definately required.  Ick!

Orange Chicken is sweet and tangy. You can order it with more spice and enjoy the sweet with the heat.  The sizzling rice soup in good. We order it with Shrimp only. Otherwise, you get beef, chicken and 1 shrimp in it.

I don't know what happened after being gone for 2 months in the summer, but this place is not the same!  Seems like most of the front office staff is new, new vet tech today young and an experienced and the customer service focus is completely non-existent.  I will be looking for a new vet for my 3 dogs.

Needed new front shocks for my 06 Silverado. Called Bill a couple weeks back and based on our conversation, recommended the Rancho 9000 adjustable shocks. I rolled in and told him I was ready to buy them. Although Rancho increased the price like 15% over what he quoted me on the phone, he honored the price he gave me on the phone. That is straight up good business!  When I asked him about their return policy, he said if the shocks look new and you bring them back in the original box, they will refund your purchase if they do not fit properly.

As Jana described, this location is hit and miss. They seem to move stuff all over the store and an item you think should be in one section, is in a totally different area. It is near impossible to find an employee to point you in the right direction to find what you need.   If Lowes was closer, I would rarely come to this store.

The grub is better than most other bar food I have encountered and Casey Jones is a regular place to visit for me.   The honey hot wings (order extra crispy) are OUTSTANDING! I will order them that way from now on. I mixed it up on a dozen. Half were honey hot, the other half medium. Honey Hot wins out. The burgers and salads are great (ranch dressing). Very expansive menu that offers a variety for the most discriminating pallet. (ha ha)  $2.25 bud light draft. $3.00 craft beers on Thursday I think. Anyway, it is a great place to chill and watch a football game, meet clients for lunch or just swing by for a beer and some wings.

I had a craving for breakfast and had not been to Denny's in at least a couple years. The food was much better than I expected. I had pancakes, scrambled eggs (which actually had flavor), hash browns (crispy) and sausage. Needless to say, I was not able to finish the huge plate full of food. The waitress was exceptionally nice and very efficient. I would come back to this location next time I feel the need for a big breakfast.

Yay, I'm a fan, but also do not have many choices in Desert Ridge. The store is clean, the people helpful and friendly and rarely have to wait long in line.   A plus for the cart/hand  wipes for germaphobes like me! That stuff should be mandatory in all grocery stores.

Fresh and tasty! They no longer have a wet burrito. They discontinued the sauce as not enough people ordered it. Bummer! Otherwise, food is good and reasonable and most importantly, has many choices. The chopped salad is good with grilled chicken.

I really enjoy fresh healthy food. The salads are great and aways have a great variety of daily soups. The chicken walnut salad sandwich is my favorite sandwich and usually get 1/2 sandwich and cup of soup. It gets really busy around lunch time daily, so you may want to get there no later than 12:30pm if you have a group of two or more.

Only good experiences here for us. We adopted all 3 of our pit bulls from Benji's Rescue.  The prices are good being a big box store. Some things we buy on line, but get 2/3 of our dog food here and other items. The staff is very helpful and friendly.

I don't wash my truck here. The coffee is great. Employees very friendly and get you in and out in a blink of an eye. (Danny's Family Gourmet Market)   The car wash is WAY overpriced for what you get. I have to agree with Chuck S. on that one. If you want a great car wash at an unbelievable value. Message me and I will YELP you the details.

I have tried a couple other Vietnamese food restaurants and think Tea Lite has the freshest ingredients and best overall flavor.   #1 or #3 depending if I want more beef or spring rolls. The pork ball sandwich is also tasty. The soups are great when it is cooler. Pasadena on them in summer.  I usually go there for lunch. It can get crowded at 12pm so you may want to try earlier or a little later.

I prefer it over AMC and it is right around the corner in Desert Ridge. I rather go a bit further and get me some Tea Light Cafe BBQ noodles, hit up some wings at Buffalo Wild or get a pita from Extreme Pita before or after the movie.   But the review needs to be about the Theatre, I know.. So here is what makes Harkins, in my opinion a much better choice:   1) Cine Capri Theatre. HUGE, comfortable, kick-ass sound and a great movie experience guaranteed to get this Theatre if the movie is not a blockbuster or popular)  2) Popcorn is usually hot and fresh (and you get a free one with every $25 gift card purchase) Buy the Harkins souvenir cup for future visits for $1 refills.  3) The flavored salt you can choose any apply yourself. White Cheddar, ranch (my favorite) Carmel or nacho.  4) The employees are friendly and don't seem annoyed to help you out.   See you at the movies!

For big box building stores, it is as good as it gets. The whole vibe is head and shoulders above Home Depot. They have very helpful employees to help you find what you are looking for, albeit I do not have to ask as much for some reason while at Lowes. I guess they don't have their head up their asses when shelving items.   The paint department is very helpful and really try to educate you on the products for your specific use. They do seem to be a little bit higher in price, but the shopping experience is worth it.

Oh, writing this review reminds me I got to schedule my next appointment.   I read some of the bad reviews and just don't get it. Luckily, my profession allows me to go during the day instead of happy hour, so I guess I dodged the loud sports bar bullet.   Sorry about the contract issues. I am just going to believe they will be professional and honorable when it comes time to renew or cancel my membership.   There are some really skilled professionals at this location.

We went this time for my wife's birthday. She got a $30 certificate from their birthday club or membership. That being said, for the two of us, we still dropped $80. The Saki Bomber with large ASHI beer was $20 in itself. The food was really flavorful, but after seeing the same chef routing more than 5 or 6 times, it loses it's luster.   It is a great place to go to celebrate a birthday, anniversary, etc if you have not been before and would like something a bit different and entertaining, give it a try.

I have seen more accommodating and pleasant lobbies at auto repair facilities.   Ghetto like atmosphere. Stark, plastic folding chairs and green laminate flooring with dull play-do gray walls. No pictures or artwork. Looks like a 40" TV. I am no designer, but this place is drab and needs decorating.  The wait was also about 20 minutes to get in.

If there was way to rate him a zero, this unprofessional hack would get it! My wife had to go 3 times to fix an implant crown he did. The last time, he cemented over the screw without taking a few seconds to make sure it was in place properly.   Here are the wait times for each visit: 45 minutes, 1.5 hours and again for 45 minutes. Obviously, he or his staff is ill equip to keep a schedule.   The time she waited 1.5 hours, he was so frantic and stressed out, she told him she did not want him working on her in that condition. He does not respect anyone's time other than his own. In fact, after his MELTDOWN, he never apologized and was again late the third time to fix his mistakes from the past two sessions.   Going to the dentist is a challenge in itself. No need to add further stress to the procedure. There are plenty of professional, customer friendly dentists to choose from. I would not go to him if it was free!

Always liked this much more than Chipolte. The burritos are stuffed and huge. The chicken is really, really flavorful. I feel it is a healthy alternative to other fast food Mexican joints.   The new mango spicy salsa is great in the burrito. There are also plenty of options to go into the burro.

What more could an Irishman ask for? 100 beers on tap? DONE! Not just the beer, but get happy from 3-6pm with select appetizers and pizza.  Here are my fav's: Bernaise sliders and chicken lettuce raps. The pizza is also good. I have had the tai chicken, bbq and hawaiian. Me likes the hawaiian the best.   For entree, I like the scalopes over orzo pasta. The size is a bit small, but packs a punch of flavor.   70's rock..

Mmmm... paper thin crust. Love the sausage with light sauce. I will warn you it is not very filling, but mighty tasty. Again, note they are only open Thursday through Sunday.

I am only reviewing this location as the other locations are hit and miss. The one on Tatum and Dynamite was bad both times we went there. So, I go out of my way for this Barro's Pizza. The decor is similar to all locations. Very drab and not very comfortable. But, we are talking about a pizza joint, so they will get a pass on the decor.   I had a mini Hawaiian pizza on my last trip and was delicious! The crust was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sauce was tasty and the perfect amount. I ate every bit of it with no crust leftovers. That was how outstanding it was.   I am surprised that the consistency between locations is such a wild swing from outstanding to mediocre at best. The owner should look into that.

N. Phoenix chamber holds weekly lunches here. I have tried several things on the menu and have not been impressed. Misty is very friendly and attentive. The quality of food misses the mark by a long shot. $10 for a cheeseburger? Ok, I will pay that no problem if the burger is delicious, but their burger is a $6 burger in my opinion. The meat is not very good quality and is overly salty.   I recall the food being better about a year ago. Matthew pretty much summed it up as going down hill. It is no wonder the place is so quiet, they can't get enough repeat customers because the food is bad. They are always doing a promo or event to try to get people in the door. The problem is, once they do, how are they going to entice them to return? Answer: BETTER FOOD or lower prices for the quality they are currently providing.

There is such a great variety on the menu, it makes it easy to come back and try different dishes. Last night I had the grilled chicken with artichoke hearts, spinach, mushrooms with a wonderful cream sauce and pumpkin seeds on top to finish it off. It also came with mashed potatoes and wonderful grilled veggies, included corn. It was VERY GOOD!  The happy hour is also a great value and again has many different options to choose from. $5 chambord margarita is sweet and strong! I only had one, but already felt the affects when it was empty.  I have tried a plethora of items on the menu and have not been disappointed in any of them. (The salads are great too!)

OK,  This is the final word after my 2nd experience at Jersey Mike's.  I got the Chipolte Philly sub again and it fell way short. This time I did not waste the calories and only choked down half the sandwich.  Whoever made it went way overboard on the chipolte mayo or sauce they use and again the meat was lost in the colossal bread bath.  Been there twice and will NOT return. I sure hope the other sandwiches are better than the Philly, but I am not going for round 3 at this joint!

My first and likely last visit at this local meat market ( I mean bar). The only reason I went was out of curiosity and a free drink or appetizer for yelp check in.  If you are single, 40's and enjoy a place where you have to scream at someone who is 2 feet away so they can hear you, enjoy  lounge entertainment, this may be the place for you.  I do have to say the waitresses are super cute and there outfits are very easy on the eyes.   I had the dirty martini with blue cheese olives ( you have to ask for those) It was not dirty at all, so she brought me some olive juice which I shared with another patron.  The mushroom and tenderloin flatbread was tasty. The shrimp martini tasted processed, chicken on a stick and tuna was disgusting and were sent back. So, 1 out of 4 appetizers hit the mark? I prefer 3 or 4 out of 4.  On a positive note, the mango mojito martini was VERY GOOD. That would be the only thing to bring me back. If you go, I hope your experience was better than mine.  Or and one more thing.... Valet parking for $6 bucks for a center that has only a handful of shops open?? SUCK IT! I will drive a block if I have to rather than get !@#^ in the a$$ by paying some douche canoe to park my car when the place is empty.    Cheers...

Ok, This review is coming from a 41 year old, so if you are 16-26 it may not apply to you.   I just don't get it. The clothes are cheap, cheap, cheap. Not just in price but in material, looks and am assuming wearability.   It looks like the first time you wash something it may not fit a 13 year old.   This is like a cheap ass old navy, but if you only got $5 bucks to spend on a shirt and are ok with looking like a cheap ass nerd, shop till you drop baby.

Man, I really like Charleys. I know it is in the mall, but the location outside of the mall was where I used to go in a couple times a month. Sometimes, I think about going to PV Mall and planning it around lunch. The fries are crispy, hot and fresh! I ask them to mix me up 1/2 ranch 1/2 BBQ sauce. Stir it up real well and dip the fries in it. Whoo baby, that is GOOD stuff.

The salesman Chris was the shining star of this outfit. Unfortunately, that is where the quality experience ended. He captured my design perfectly. The execution missed when the newly acquired installer showed up alone for a sizeable cabinet job. I had 8 foot cabinets, with over head storage and a work bench.   This job should have been a two man project. At least from the start to get the tall cabinets and overheads set up. It should have been a one day install and turned into 2 full days and they are still not complete. The staples holes were not filled, there was no caulking for sizable gaps where my wall was bowed a bit, (3 minutes to caulk that by the way) missing hinges, missing shelves (they brought out 2nd day) but hinges were wrong size, tall door was missing hinge and still does not shut right, is delaminating, chipped face on one of the shelves that Jay (operations manager) said he would replace when in the area. After a week and three days, a technician show up to replace 2 doors, shelf and fill the staple holes.   I would think twice about having them complete a job for you. There is disorganization and the craftsmanship is not of the highest quality. (adjustable shelves are not peg board type) they screw in two cheap aluminum rails and clips for the shelving.   They also charge you 4% if you are paying by credit card, so I ended up writing a check.  An A+ rating by the BBB is bought by businesses, so do not rely on that when making your decision.

Want to schedule an appointment for heart worm test or vaccinations? Tough titty, said the kitty when the milk ran dry...  I called in today and receptionist said the soonest is the 18th for a no appointment (wait in line with the masses) clinic. Debbie indicated that their new policy(effective January 1, 2013) is NOT to schedule non emergency appointments for any pet older than 1 year old. Unless you have a puppy or kitten for spay or neuter, forget about getting any appointment for routine vaccinations or tests here!  Debbie has been pleasant both in person and on the phone, so I am not casting blame on her for their policies. They are a for profit business, they can run it however they please.   If you want better service and have your pet seen on your time, expect to pay more scheduling with your primary vet. It all comes down to price vs. convenience, what your time is worth and how much patience you have. ;)

After my initial review, PAWS has changed their policy and now has clinic days EACH AND EVERY WEDNESDAY, not once per month for pets over 12 months old.   I called ahead to get an idea of the wait and there was only one person ahead of me. I brought my two boys in, got the shots and heart worm tests done, then brought Kayla in for her heart worm test an hour later and in 30 minutes, she was done and all tests were negative.   Just by changing this policy, I am certain they will have more business. Nice job PAWS for being more available for pet owners.

I usually don't review a place after only going once, since being burned several times in the past, but I was so impressed by the quality of the sandwich, I had to say It was very, very good. I will be back next time I am in the area or go out of my way if I really feel like a fresh, delicious sandwich.

June 28th,  104 degrees outside.  Feels close to the same inside. I made a comment to my wife as the owner passed by so he would overhear me and thankfully,  he did and after 10 minutes,  it felt much better.   Definitely pass on the appetizer sampler as everything is completely fried fried and fried. Even the dumplings were fried as well and had some type of sweetener on them. The fried avocado was smothered in sauce and after a few minutes was completely soggy. The Tempera was mostly that ;tempura with a sliver of vegetable. We ended up taking most the sampler home because our nephew, 17 will eat anything and I didn't want to throw away $13.  I order the half half eel dragon and spicy crunchy roll($10) It tasted fresh and was decent, but again had way too much sauce all over it . I've been here about 7 or 8 times and think this experience will be my last.

Yeah, the butter burgers are great, but that is just the beginning. The onion rings are Fabulous! The concrete mixers have many more options that Dairy Queen, the side salads are worth a mention for the healthy alternative. They even have green beans as a side dish. OK, it is fast food, but good fast food that does not taste processed. (McDonald's and Burger King)  It is as good at is gets for taste, value and menu. There is not a more robust fast food offering that I am aware of.

3 for 3. Delicious every time! Brulee Burger is my FAV! It has a fried egg on it. Also has pickled onions, bacon, Havarti cheese and sugar cooked into the bun. I also have had the country fried burger which was really good too. They make their own spin on the country gravy sauce that has a very nice blend of herbs and spices. The next time I am going to try the Beach House burger that has a roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella and pico de Gallo.   They also make their own bbq potato chips that have a bit of a kick to them. This is a really good burger joint. They have only been open a few months. Please go try them out so they can stay in business. It is a shame that really great places go under just because people do not know about them.

Super friendly, fast watch sizing, affordable. Absolutely recommend. They also do jewelry repair and sell nice watches.

I just don't know if there is a 5 star burger joint anywhere in the valley. If so, please hit me up!   The atmosphere is industrial/beach style, very clean as other reviewers stated, and the burgers are a good value. The ingredients are fresh and tasty. I am not sure what they are trying to do with the salsa bar? It really does not fit a burger joint. Looks more like it should be in a Rubio's. Marketing folks at the habit, take notice. What were you thinking here?  It would be nice if there was a location further up north. I would not go out of my way to come her, but if in the area would definitely stop in again.

Just about the most unfriendly government employees next to the MVD. I totally agree with Greg on the inconvenience issue. I had a return package to China and was told one thing and when I returned, a different lady told me something entirely different.

After visiting the post office twice recently, the experience was completely different than the dozen or so visits in 2014.  The lines were long, but that is almost ALWAYS the case, but both employees were pleasant, helpful and handled my business quick.   I sure hope things continue to run smoothly, because the post office is just one step below the MVD in terms of trying patience.

Absolutely love the concept! High end car wash, detail center, but it does not stop there. As others mentioned, the BBQ is very good, but to have 5 homemade BBQ sauces that are all unique? Get OUT! We have been here 3  Sundays over the past month since finding out about this place through YELP!   Get the pulled pork. It is awesome! I have also had the Eggs Benedict and it was also wonderful.  The deserts are also VERY GOOD and VERY FRESH! I love the lemon bar. It is a standout favorite for me.   When my folks come in to visit in December, Tom's thumb will be on the docket!

This concept is a hum ding-er in my book. Where can you go to sit down and immediately grab something rolling by on a conveyor belt and star eating? HERE!   Plates start at $1.50 for your basic California crunchy roll to $5 for a bit exotic type rolls. I ate there twice in one week, so I can say it works for me for a quick, fun place to eat on the fly. Is there better sushi elsewhere? Of course, but the experience and food is still quite good. The wait staff is very friendly as well.

I have not found a gym of this caliber for an unbeatable price of $10 per month with no up front initiation fees or long term contracts. (I think they are charging $24 now)  The machines are brand new and never have to wait for something to open up.   Short on time? No problem. They have a 30 minute circuit area that combines strength training and cardio. Red light cool off, green light go.It goes by super fast!  They also have personal trainers if you need some extra motivation or want to create a fitness plan tailored to your individual goals.  You will not find classes, pool or court, but most everything else is there to get and keep in shape.

If a bread sandwich with a two paper thin slices of meat is up your alley, you will love this place! They claim "Gourmet Sandwiches"? Are you kidding me? I am not sure why Jimmy John's are popping up everywhere, the sandwiches are a joke! Don't waste you money or taste-buds.

If you have been to one outlet mall, you have seen it all. The same stores across the country. Not to mention it is hot as h*** with very limited coverage and NO MISTERS! The prices are also full retail, so do not expect to find a bargain.

I was in the mood for a hot dog, noticed the sign while driving on Shea and pulled in around 1:15 pm. People were starting to clear out, but the lobby and seating area was still packed.   The decor was interesting and comfortable. This operation is very fast paced as Nydia mentioned in her review. What I like about the layout is you can see them preparing your food and it appears extremely well maintained, clean and organized.   Update 1/2/14: Jumbo chili dog with grilled onions is messy and not much to brag about. The itailan beef was good, but not sure I agree with the masses on this one.

Very fresh and extremely flavorful! Try the Baha Chicken Hash.   This is an update to my prior evaluation. We have been 4 or 5 times and only once was the experience less than favorable.  Thank you Mario for responding to my prior experience. That shows you really care about providing a high quality product.

The Pharmacy is helpful and staffed properly. The counter person always greets you as you walk in the door. The layout is functional and easy to find what you are looking for.  It is also very clean. What more can I say? Nice experience.

Love this location, although this chain is consistent in several other locations I have been to in AZ.  Great quality ingredients means a higher quality meal and you get what you pay for.  Have tried several different subs and liked them all. Never a bad meal here or take out.

A couple weeks back I was in search of a new barber after going 6 weeks without a haircut.  I was tired of the inconsistencies of Sports Clips and their ever revolving door of personnel. (This is true of the majority of chain haircut joints.)  I found Mr. Nate on Yelp (of course) and he was great!  We talked about Yelp and how good it worked for him in Scottdale.  He took over this location from a buddy about 5 months ago and completely re modeled it.  It is very clean,  comfortable barber chairs and has a barber shop feel.   He gave me an excellent cut, hot towel, hot shave with straight razor that left the back of my neck feeling ever so clean. He finished up with a massaging machine back rub.   I look forward to going back in a couple weeks to feel revitalized.   He also takes appointments and walk ins and is open 6 days a week.  If you are even close or with a 7-8  mile range like I am,  I would highly recommend going to see Nate.
