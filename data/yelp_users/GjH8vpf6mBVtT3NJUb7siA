I was refereed to this vet hospital by a friend who works with felines regularly & have actually taken my cat here a couple of times with a satisfactory outcome--- BUT when I brought in my new puppy WHAT A MISTAKE!!! Not only was I over-struck by pressure/guilt to accept every recommended service but it felt like like all these shots & services were recommended to meet some kind of quota on their part & were just trying to increase the cost of my visit.  It seriously was the most uncomfortable experience in a veterinary office. The vet tech also made me feel like I needed all these services because my dog was a rescue not a regulated animal. It made me upset, but honestly I overlooked it & thought maybe I was being over sensitive until I called the office 3 weeks later regarding my documents. Well Now I have been left with no other option but to write this review because of such terrible communication regarding my dogs health & customer service.  So to sum it up, the main reason why I am writing this review is because when I called to get further information which wasn't clear on the documents, the receptionist informed me that I should have came in for a booster shot that was never mentioned to me or even listed on the documentation.  After I spoke to the disconcerned manager Peter, asking him why it wasn't on my paperwork & how would I know to perform this booster to insure the first shot would be effective, he had nothing to offer me except that "they were going to perform the booster shot when I went in for the other shots."  Yes there were other recommended shots listed on my paperwork, but they NOT only were just recommendations, but the one shot had nothing to do with the other, nor did I even have a follow up appointment.    This place not only gave me such a uncaring vibe about my pet, but acted completely unprofessional & were unwilling to take any responsibility for their documentation error, nor make up for it in any way.  I even called back asking to speak with another manager with higher credentials, giving them a 3rd chance to give me some satisfaction here-- but that other manger never even called. BIG BOO on this place!

Some of the best veggi/vegan food around & def the best here in AZ. Are you unsure of what meat substitutes are or taste like?  Green really nails it...& their fake 'chicken' is seriously some of the best Ive had across the country ---- try the OG Poo Boy sandwich, a spicy buffalo 'chicken' sandwich on a sub roll (so delicious) or I usually get the Ranchero Salad Buffalo wing style instead of BBQ.  Seriously I cant go there without getting the Buffalo anything!  Check out their new location in Phoenix on 7th st ---- with their dessert cafe next door, 'Nami' you can get fantastic vegan pastries, Soynami's (vegan version of Dairy Queens blizzard), cupcakes, coffee & more!!! SO GREAT! +++

the worst pizza ever. pizza dough isnt supposed to taste like Wonder bread, all doughy & sweet.  This place is an insult to Italian pizza.  These people arent even Italian. Just SAD.

I arrived here with recommendation from a clOse friend who has very high standards...but apparently mine are higher, haha who knew!   the menu here is so limited for vegetarians...and if ur vegan, forget about it! your looking at a salad, if that!  I was hoping for at least some fresh fruit...or maybe the tomatoe soup would be vegetable based, right..? not even. tomato soup made with chicken broth...wtf?  another disappointment, wawa!  the counter service was completely unaware as well...and tried to sell me toast with jam when I asked if they had fruit. seriously, people...this is more of a laugh than a complaint, p.s.

I really don't know how this company has been in business for so long. The customer service is atrocious! I understand that in this field of work you can run behind as there are a lot of uncertain variables, but you would think they would plan for this by leaving open time for delays and rescheduling. The manager there who I spoke with, Molly was disgusting with her choice of conversation & had nothing to offer me but a reschedule 2 months out for a 3 hour late appointment, which encroached into the dinner hours. The way this company operates is down right unprofessional in inappropriate. Not only will I never hire these people again, but I will also never purchase a groupon again either. This is what I get for trying a new company at a discount.

Dlisa is the best waxer I have ever experienced!! I initially was just having my legs waxed by her & she insisted I try a Brazilian wax...lets just say I will NEVER shave down there again!! BRAZILIAN WAXING IS THE 'CATS MEOW'!! (no pun intended, heh) The pain is really minimal...she is quick & fast, you will be in-n-out in no time!! No need to be shy either cause Dlisa is very comforting & sweet... you will feel like a new person walking outta there!!

Sign up for a Yoga Nirvana yoga retreat to Hawaii if you want to stay hidden in the middle of the woods-- a 40 minute drive each way to the beach, in grimy unsanitary cabins that remind you of sleep-away camp in Flagstaff when you were 15, with a Yoga instructor that downplays you with every inquisitive question, who has no plan of action nor willingness to claim responsibility of set expectations with a price tag of $1299.  Not only did Jim Keegan (owner of Yoga Nirvana & retreat leader) not live up to the expectations set prior to the retreat-  (2 meals cooked by private chef & 2 yoga classes a day) -but when a question was proposed due to lack of planning & communication his response was one which became defensive & condescending with passive aggressive behavior using tactics of intimidation. YIKES (red flag #1)  But what really did it for me was the conversation over our first dinner where Jim proceeded to express his disapproval of the horrific traditional female genital mutilation practices by the Afgan people saying they "should be extinguished as a culture of people."  WHOA --- Yes female genital mutilation is evil but so is genocide! I was in complete shock! I mean isn't my Yoga instructor teaching consciousness awareness, compassion, patience & positivity? For the sake of love & revelations,  weren't we here on a retreat? Meanwhile at the dinner table it was genocide. COMPLETE YIKES! (red flag #2)  p.s. female genital mutilation isn't even a practice in Afghanistan.  Suddenly my yoga instructor, who I claimed as a teacher of 8+ years became a complete stranger.  That night I decided to myself that I'd be leaving the group & that there was no way I would be able to surround myself with this type of energy off of the Yoga mat, let alone spend the next 6 days in Hawaii a 40 minute drive from the sun rising & setting over the ocean, in the middle of a forest.  Going with the flow until the right timing presented itself, I left on my own journey the second morning after witnessing Jim as he simply watched, from behind these pavilions where we were having a.m. yoga practice, 3 of his students who were lost due to lack of communication. After some time had passed my conscious forced me to get up from my mat & walk out from behind our location, signaling to the students --where they even started there own practice. Not only did Jim not welcome these students to the practice, but Jim had the audacity to question me as I walked by him,  "are you or aren't you practicing?"  I GASPED!!  The real question here is, "Jim, are YOU or aren't YOU practicing?"   Like I said, Ive been a student of Jim's for over 8 years, from way before the beginning days of Yoga Nirvana studios & am in complete shock that meeting him out of the classroom was like meeting a complete stranger...a stranger whose embodiment is the complete opposite of his own teachings.  Ive asked Jim to refund only $200 of the $1299 cost to cover my dinning expenses & other yoga instruction of which I attended at a local island studio & his response was "why should I... you are leaving voluntarily?" followed by a simple "NO." After some serious reflecting, for over a week now  --  I have come to the conclusion that Jim Keegan has been teaching what he MOST needs to learn & practice himself. Any PHD would call this projection.  This person does not in any way, shape or form embody his own teachings off of the mat & out of the classroom.   This is a true case of :: 'PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH'   Can I get a witness? Yes I can -- because 2 other students (full names upon request) also decided to separate from the group, who joined me due to the negative energy, nasty attitude & total confusion/ chaos that started upon arrival to the island & our first destination 'COSTCO!!!'    My heart goes out for you Jim & while experiencing the practices of my life in Hawaii lead by both Kali Ray Torres & Psalm Issadora, Ive humbled myself to you, committing myself to a prayer for you every time I step on my mat.  Your time will come....will it be karma, fate or destiny?   NAMASTE

lets just say that I didn't particularly care for coffee til I had Cartel!! Just a great clean flavor! mmmm...my favorites are the Iced Toddy, Espresso Excelente (which is double shot with homemade horchata) and the cappuccino!   There are only 2 coffee's I drink in this town, and Cartel is one, the other is secret!

Yes this place is gorgeous; a restored church turned gastro pub with a great vibe!  the bar is the alter, how sweet is that?!! My new Sunday spot & Happy Hour starts at 2 with a secret menu including an egg brunch taco. WIN! As a vegetarian suto vegan, I have many options.  This place is like the 'Whole Foods' of tacos.  The veg tacos are to die for with rotating local seasonal vegetables...which included brussel sprouts, carrots & collard greens! The tortillas are fresh made soft corn, YUM so tasty! The rice & beans are veg too. And as for the drink, it was so delicious --- I got the Osbourn -- nice & strong, well worth the price using a top shelf smooth Anejo Tequila & all the juice is squeezed fresh.  I don't think they use mixes at all. Great bar & delicious food. & also the chips & salsa are complimentary. Like I said, this place is my new Church on Sunday.

This place is gorgeous & I think the remodel is outstanding! Unfortunately tho, it would have a lovely feel if the crowd wasn't so weak. WTH do these people come from...?   On our way home from a wedding, my friends & I thought it would be great to peep out & get into some late night bocce ball because it's right here in our neighborhood...right? Nope,Totally wrong.  The crowd was everything but fun. I mean seriously...after our first round of Bocce, a small group arrived & decided it would be ok to hang out on the green, then had the audacity to tell us we were being rude b/c we threw the ball in their direction "aggressively." Ha- It was so absurd the lack of etiquette combined with attitude refusing to step off the green & antagonizing a fight with us to top it off. I had to get security.  Bocce balls were about to go though some heads.  I don't know, but maybe installing a fence along the green near the bar may help guide immature bar crowd to stay on the patio...?  Considering the selection of restaurants & bars in this area, It would be safe to say I most likely will not be returning. I mean for reals...the Vig is known for having a Bocce court. These people were beat.
