My hubby and I met some good friends at The Greene House last night for dinner at 6:30 p.m.  After reading the recent reviews on Yelp, I was a bit skeptical to try this place to try this place.  So glad we did!   I could not have been more pleased!     We were seated very quickly inside at a table for four at the window.  This was perfect as we love to people watch.  Kierland Commons is a great place to do just that!  Our table started with the hummus app. which was great!  Everyone had something different for their entree.  Our table had the tuna tacos, the fillet, the shrimp pasta as well as the bacon wrapped tenderloin.  We also shared a Mac & Cheese for the table. Not one complaint!  Everyone was very happy.  The stir fry veggies with my fillet were delish!  We wrapped up our dinner with the donut dessert (easy to share for four after a big meal).    The service was also wonderful and attentive.  Our server, Renee, never let our wine glasses get empty and we never wanted for anything.   She was fantastic and very nice!    Bottom line is you have to judge places for yourself.  Last night was good company, good atmosphere, good food and good service.  We could not have been happier!  After dinner went next door to North to have a night cap and watch the end of the basketball game.  Alex, the bartender at North, was terrific fun and made a wonderful martini for me based on my preferences!  He seemed to enjoy whipping it up as much as I enjoyed drinking it!    Thumbs up to Fox Restaurant Concepts!  We will be back!

Found this salon on Yelp and I was NOT disappointed.  Reviews are true!  Nice, small, simple shop with a pleasant staff that knows what they are doing!   I have very rarely (if ever) been happy with any haircut I've received, including from top hair designers at local high end salons.  I have very fine hair so there isn't a lot to work with.   I have always figured you get what you pay for and I wanted the best haircut.  Boy, have I been wrong!   The Root is proof that you can have a positive experience, a great cut and not have buyer's remorse after paying the bill.  So pleasantly surprised.  I felt comfortable going in for the first time.  Eric, my stylist, was very friendly and easy going.  He did not make me feel embarrassed for the condition of my hair but offered 'real' suggestions on how to treat my hair better!  No pretense or pressure...just knowledgeable and friendly.  So refreshing!   It has been 8 weeks since my last cut and I have just scheduled my next hair appt. with Eric.  This time I'm going to let him do my color!   My salon color experiences have been far worse than my cutting experiences so stay tuned!

BTW:  open face sandwiches are a fancy name for bruschetta.  Very good!!  Also, Shawn was the BEST server!  So fun, friendly, knew the menu (great recommendations) and we didn't want/wait for anything.  Bravo!!   Going back for their wine deals during the week!

Seriously couldn't have expected how good this experience was.  Arrived late and were greeted by Jake and Bretton with a warm welcome.  Didn't hesitate to let us order (and split) dinner even though they were closing in 20 minutes.  We went with their recommendations for both dinner and cocktails and were NOT disappointed!  Incredible!  The food, cocktails and service were all 5 star worthy!  This is now one of our regular spots for lunch, HH and dinner!  Can't wait to go back!
