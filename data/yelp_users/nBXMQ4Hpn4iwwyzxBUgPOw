The staff is 4-stars, but the way they closed their doors and didn't inform clients is sucky! A phone call or email informing us that they had changed ownership would have been the best way to find out..not showing up to tan and seeing a (very long) note on the locked door. I hope the girls working there find another job quickly!! Any salon would be lucky to have them!

We love Nails Unlimited! Cindy and her staff are always friendly and very capable. The salon is clean and very comfortable. We have been coming here for years and we will continue for many more to come!

Such a blast! The staff is super! Lots of pool tables, along with darts and some old school video games! I loved that we could get food from Rino D's right next store! I also love the fact that they stay open late.

Sewell is the BEST! He got me taken care of the same day I called. Jordan & Dwayne were friendly and very professional! These guys know their stuff!! They use top of the line material, too! For great, reliable service, call Southwestern Auto Glass!
