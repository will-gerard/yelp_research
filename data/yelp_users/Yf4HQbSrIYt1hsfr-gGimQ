After my fianc√© was finally at his wits ends with our recently adopted shelter dog, it was time to call for help before she ended up back where she came from.  Jade came to our home, and her love for animals truly shows. She was very patient with our dogs, and gave us lots of good information to help our pup succeed in our home with our house rules. My boyfriend really took the information to heart, and training our little one has become a team effort. Jade was reasonable priced, quick to help, and she helped me keep my puppy! She even called 2 days after on training session to see how everything was going. I couldn't be more grateful!

I have never been treated so horribly by the owner of ANY other establishment in town.  DO NOT GO HERE!!!   Per the owner, Deanna Montrose, the salon was not going to be able to honor a coupon I had purchased for a Brazilian Blowout.  Findings show that they can over time cause cancer, and they didn't want to carry something that could hurt the staff or customers.  Understandable.  However, she assured me that what they could do in return would acheive the same effect as the treatment I had been getting from them for 6 months, and that it would last longer.    Okay....so I go in for the treatment recommended to me by the owner.  After rinsing out the straightener, all the color I had paid to have done 2 weeks prior bled out of my hair leaving it orange-ish and feeling fried.  I had asked if it would effect my color and was told "no" as long as I waited at least a week between having the 2 services done.  To be safe, I waited 12 days.  Upset, and on the verge of tears, I was approached by Deanna Montrose telling me that her crew could tell I was upset.  I told her I thought my hair "looked like sh*t", as I am sure most people would say if they were brought back to a mirror to discover that their hair had turned a different color that what they came in to the salon with.  She told me that I should not be cussing at them, to which I explained I wasn't cussing at anyone but I was completely mislead about what would happen to my hair and I was within my right to be upset at having orange hair.  She used the cancer explaination again, told me how her products are safe, and what I got was more expensive than what I had originally purchased.  I was thinking in my head "do you think you did me a favor by giving me something monitarily worth more? The other product you had sold me 3 other times may had been cheaper, but this never happened."  Her voice was raised and she acted as if I was causing a scene, but it was exactly the opposite...she was causing a scene, and making me feel beaten down.  I was sitting with my lips pressed tight, because I could I have never been yelled at by ANY person at ANY business I have ever paid to visit, yet here I was being scolded for HER misrepresentation of the product. A product I discussed with her, before I set the appointment, in great depth.   Rudely, I was offered for the salon to tone my hair to make some of the orange go away. I explained that I went to a different salon that uses a different brand of color, and Deanna informed me that color charts were "universal", and that her color was "better" than the color a got at Toni and Guy.  I go to T+G, because I have used the exact same color for years.  I know what it looks like when it fades, and I know it will always match up the same to what is already on my head.  Have you ever heard anyone tell you that all hair color is universal?  Than what is the purpose of carrying different brands or having copyright laws?  Deanna Montrose, as a business owner and as a customer service representative, has given me the single worst experience of my life.  I have been to cheaper and spendier salons...and her middle-of-the-road strip mall establishment is just that.  I would have expected that I would have been shown a little bit of sympathy being that I was obviously upset from an incident that I DID NOT CAUSE.  It was Deanna's smug opinion regarding the product that she was offering that did the damage to my hair.  If she would have listened, been honest that their was a possibility that my color could be ruined, and shown some compassion to an uspet customer I would not be writing this review.  Do not go to Scissors Rox Paper, because should you find yourself unhappy in any way, you will be scolded by the owner for having these feelings.  Your opinion will not matter, and you will be treated like a second-class citizen.

This place is great for a quick, healthy bite to eat. I found this place through a 2-for-1 coupon and could not be more pleased. I highly recommend the fire-grilled chicken teriyaki bowl. Very tasty and I love the veggies that come with...my only complaint is that I swear I have gotten a few frozen veggies in my mix before. It's so hard to say for sure since the portions are so big that my food get cold before I can finish it anyway. Overall...very good, fair prices, worth a visit!

This is my second review of Betty's, but first since "Betty's" has been purchased by new owners.   First, let me start off by saying that the woman working the front desk can't keep her paperwork or facts straight. When my dog was done being groomed, they called my emergency contact, who was out of town, and never bothered to call me to pick up my dog! This bumbling mother daughter duo kept calling my dog by the wrong name even though I kept correcting them.   Second, The quality of service my animal received was subpar at best. Her hair was not cut correctly, her ears were cut two different lengths, and she did not smell as clean as she used to under old management. Before this place was bought out, my dog looked adorable every time I picked her up. She had bows in her hair, looked like she had been pampered, and always smelled just delicious! Not anymore. All you should expect is a basic trim, and you will have won the lottery if it actually looks like what you asked for! these new owner's could care less about the quality of service your animal receives.  Lastly, and this is just my opinion, I feel like these people are just running a business. I don't see the "love of dogs" in their behavior or demeanor. The people who used to be there loved animals, and they made me feel like they really cared about my dog. I will not be returning to Betty's, or giving any more money to the people who are currently running this place and can't remember my dog's name after I've said it about 10 times.

This place is truly a gem, and Arizona is lucky to have a couple franchises located around town. The food is amazing, and will not disappoint. The cool atomic/ retro vibe makes for a fun and interesting atmosphere. Staff is overall very friendly, and they try their best to get you handled right away even though the place is always packed.  I recently ordered a very large catering order for a business meeting, and I was so impressed how well they put the food together. Cute boxes, warm food, and extremely happy guests at my meeting...I felt like I really stepped my party planning skills up! I actually heard one of them squeal in excitement that we got Snooze for breakfast. Do yourselves a favor, and go now!

This place is pretty dang good. Fresh ingredients and extremely flavorful. We had the shrimp spring rolls, veggie egg rolls, and chicken pho. It did not disappoint! We will definitely be back for another round...next time, I try the coffee everyone is raving about!
