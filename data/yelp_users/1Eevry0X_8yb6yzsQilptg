I am new to hiking but I have to say after hiking this mountain I really enjoy the excercise. The trails are well maintained and easy to follow. But the trail is still far from walking a paved road which is a good thing. Ther is great veiws from every trail I have walked. There is different difficultys for different types of kikers. plenty of parking and restrooms at the bottom. there are many places to picnic and also I have seem places to have fires although I have not looked in to how or if anyone can use these places but I look forward to finding out. When I find out I will write more when I find out!

This is the second time I have been to this Drs office. For the second time I am utterly impressed with the staff, the nurses and the Doctor!  Quick run down of my visit. Coming from a small town so not really knowing what to expect. So I arrive 30 minutes early and expect to wait at least a hour from the number of people waiting. I register by a very nice lady who asked the normal questions and told me to have a seat. maybe five minutes probably less a nurse calls my name with a smile asks me to follow. weight , temp(not rectal), bp the usuals. she was very pleasent asking questions. two minutes later Dr. comes in vewry polite very good bedside manors. Dr Richard Wall by the way. he is asks lots of questions and allows you to answer fully. They dont make you feel like a number here!!  All in all I have to say I had a very good experience hereand would recomend This Place with Five Stars

I love this park for the views (trees water ducks etc.) there is a track around the whole lake which is shared by both fishers, runners, walkers and bikers. lots of benches and tables for a picnic or gathering. there is a playground for the kids which could be bigger but the kids still love it.   The park has a few thing around it which makes it nice. The libery, a golf coarse and some baseball fields are really close.   If you are having one of those days take some time for yourself walk around the lake and unwind!  Oh yea about the fishing been there a few time to fish and must say not the best fishing but what the heck. well hope this helped.

This is a very nice Safeway store. It is clean and the people are friendly . They know where thing are and will take you right to what you are looking for. I must say I go here mainly for the meat they have a good selection and the prices are usually cheaper then Fry's across the street. if you need help ask anyone but Becky Is the one that helped me out.   There is a Starbucks in this Safeway if you are in to that kind of thing. Also a deli and bakery.

Well after the first five good trips to this place I must say the service has officially came to the status of shitty! The last two time we walk into the bar area and seat our selves as usual we wait two more party's come in and promptly are waited on fifteen minutes later waiter says I can help right now I'm busy! Someone come and acts mad and gets us drinks we order right when he gets back and says I don't know why the other guy didn't help you! The bill came with the food no refills no are you ok! We try and wave someone down to pay and no one responded. So I get up and chase down a passing bartender and ask if I can pay with a big sign and a few huffs and puffs she take it we pay and leave! Today we walk in sit and wait five minutes a couple walks in sits gets menus and there drinks! This time we leave and don't think we will be back anymore! There loss seeing as I am a good tipper and a nice person.

What can I say I love this bar! wait a minute thats a different place. well just the same  I have spent many hours here people are friendly bartenders are sweet and very quick to serv you at the bar. at the tables it takes a bit longer but not to terrible. The food is better then average and the portions are big. happy hour is decent at best.
