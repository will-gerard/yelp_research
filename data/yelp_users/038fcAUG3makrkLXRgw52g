I really don't have much to say about this place. I didn't hate it, but didn't love it.   I do have to say that if you can get in before 6 PM to take advantage of their happy hour pricing, do it. The margarita's I ordered were okay, but not worth the $7.25 a piece I paid for them.   I ordered the tortilla soup and the crispy shredded beef taco (a la carte). The soup was so-so. A little salty and way too many kernels of corn for my taste. Of course one kernel of corn is too many for me.  And for the tortillas, there was none in the soup. They gave me little crispy shreds to dump in. Eh....  As for the taco. It was good, and the size was perfect for me. But one could argue that it wasn't big enough for the price you pay for it.   Finally the service was okay. The waitress was very nice and attentive. The food did come out super quick.   So yeah...that's about it.

My mother and I tried this Little nook today and it was fantastic. It was very busy, so come with a little patience, but everything was worth the wait. The staff was super friendly and the food was amazing.   I ordered the New Hampton Skillet, which was country potatoes with bacon, chicken, broccoli and cheese. The combination was delicious. My mom ordered their cinnamon swirled french toast and she said it was great. The portions are large, and I took home leftovers.   Very decent pricing, about the same or less than Mimi's Cafe, but the food was better! I can't wait to go back to try lunch and something off their dessert menu!

This has been my go-to mani/pedi spot for 6 years now. It's nothing fancy, but it's clean, friendly and they do a good job. They are great at remembering your name and ask about the kids...just super friendly. I only get regular manicures, but I hear their gels are great.  Also there is cute little kid chairs, so you can take your little mini-you to get their nails done. My daughter LOVES going.  So yeah...I'm a fan. :)

I'm seeing that there are a lot of mixed reviews for this place, but I've been here a handful of times now and I really enjoy it.  The owner is always very very nice when I come in. I actually haven't been served by anyone else on the staff, so I cannot say how the rest of the service is, but my coffee is always made well and quickly!  I also really appreciate the very LARGE selection of sugar-free flavors they have. The lists for regular and sugar-free are almost exactly the same! That's a huge bonus for me! I get enough of a kick from caffeine (especially since Coffee Rush give you a double shot for the price of one) without the need for added sugar, but I also like a variety of flavors. Plus the pricing is cheaper than other shops that I've been to lately. Not by a lot, but by a couple dimers.  And the location is also really nice. You can sit right out next to the man made lake and make friends with the local ducks. Just don't feed them any bread, and then you won't have to worry about duck shit ;)

Doesn't get too much better than this place for a family day with the kids! The playground is fun and they have equipment for all ages next to each other. I always hate how parks have the equipment for toddlers on the other side of the park from the equipment for older kids. Who do I disappoint? Anyway, props on putting age appropriate equipment close to each other.  Also the train and carousel rides are uber cheap! Good for the budget conscious family.   And don't miss out the train ride in December when it is all decked out with Christmas lights and sunbathing moose. My daughter loves it and it has become a family tradition to go for her birthday every year. Plus you can go visit Santa in the big train and get a photo for $5. Much cheaper than the mall!

I just began taking yoga classes with Gilbert Yoga and I am in love. The enviroment is soothing and relaxing, my instructor Lisette is amazing and the pricing is just right. Currently I am taking the pre-natal yoga class, but plan on continuing here once my baby is born. By far the best studio I have found in the east valley.

We frequent LJs quite often for their Saturday night buffet...we personally love their pizza. We go for the sauerkraut pizza (we always request that one to be made)...trust me, you have to try it, it's amazing. Their spaghetti pizza is also pretty darn good.  Beware of their jalepenos. I don't know where they get theirs from, but wowzas, they are always so hot! And i can usually handle spice!  It is a family owned restaurant and definitely out-dated in decor, but who cares. I will admit that service can be a little slow...you might have to set up a road-block to get a waitress to refill your drink, bu the pizza's good and if you go for buffet, you serve yourself anyway.  And you get frozen yogurt as part of your dinner...who can argue with that!

Went for dinner tonight and they added a new pizza to their buffet...a loaded potato pizza! It had shredded hash-brown like potatoes, cheddar & mozzarella cheeses, REAL bacon and chives on top. It was delicious.   And as always, the sauerkraut pizza and the spaghetti pizza were amazing.  I love this place!

It's been ages since I've been to a Bahama Bucks! I really love this place, they have the best shaved ice and just about a gazillion flavors (even pickle juice folks, seriously). And what can be better than a delicious shaved ice in the valley of the sun???   They also have great smoothies and other treats, and I just saw today that they do 1/2 price sodas from 2-5PM each afternoon. I wanna go back and try the Caribbean soda, it sounded lip smacking good.  My last tip: splurge for the cream on top of your shaved ice. It's 50 cents of pure heaven...

I love Got Sushi...it is my go to Sushi place when I'm hankering for something crazy! And the teppan chefs are amazing and entertaining! The key to this place is to ask for stuff not on the menu. The owner makes some amazing rolls that are sure tickle your taste buds. Friendly owners and staff and delicious food!

I am a bit biased since I think Scott, the owner, is a great guy, but besides that Whitey's Auto Repair is quick, has great service and extremely fair priced! You can be assured that you will not be taken for a ride, pun intended.  My rear window regulator broke last Friday, so I stopped by on my way home from work. Kevin let me know that it was too late in the day to get the part I needed but to come in first thing Monday morning and they would have it fixed ASAP. I couldn't make it Monday, but came in at 10 AM on Tuesday and was out with a fixed window that rolls up (yay) by 10:38! I don't think I've ever been in and out of an auto place that quick ever!  Definitely check them out next time you need some work done...you won't be disappointed.

Last week I went with some girlfriends to Vegas for my 30th birthday (yay!) and we really wanted to try a unique restaurant...Marrakech fit the bill perfectly and I'm so happy we decided to be adventurous and leave the strip!  The decor is amazing...the second you walk through the door, you feel as though you've been swept out of the country.  The wait staff was attentive and extremely funny...our waiter dances for the ladies ;). The gal who did the belly dancing was entertaining, talented and very sweet. I admit, she got me up to shake my groove thing...though I'm not nearly as good at belly dancing as she was...but watch out...I may be working there soon. Ha!  The food was delicious. It is a 6-course set menu, starting with shrimp scampi that is buttery, garlicky and fantastic. Then the tomato lentil soup...nice and hearty but not too heavy. I liked the vegetables and hummus, but I don't think that was the favorite with the other gals. The beef kabobs were phenomenal. OMG, melt in your mouth good and I loved the presentation! Then the fall off the bone chicken and couscous was fabulous, but at this point we were getting so full that we left so much on the plate! Dessert was good, but not my cup of tea. I felt it was missing something, but not sure what. Oh and the tea they served was delicious...definitely the best part of dessert.  So next time you are in Vegas, be adventurous and go off the beaten path...you won't  be sorry!

Lee's is one of the reasons I carry cash on hand.   When my hubby and I first moved to Chandler, we would drive by Lee's all the time and always comment on how we'd love to try it because it's so damn bright and enticing. That was five years ago and we're hooked. We take everyone from out of town here to eat at least once. My Korean in laws ask to come here first thing when they visit from Guam.  It's tasty and it's easy on the pocket book. Plus the soothing Asian voice announcing your order numbers is awesome.  My favorite is the #4 Grilled Chicken Vietnamese sandwich. I love the jalapenos, cilantro and daikon radish...gives it such a unique flavor. And the baguettes are awesome. They freshly make the bread right there in the store. It's perfection.  The croissant sandwiches are amazing as well. Big, buttery and delicious.  I also recommend their smoothies with the boba beads in them. I don't know what the heck those little squishy balls (hehehe) are, but they are freaking addictive!   And finally, get the cream-filled pastries. They are heaven for your mouth.

I am so happy I got to try this place. I must have been living under a rock because I had never really heard of Cibo much before, but wow. I cannot wait to go back now!  The atmosphere is just perfect. Our part actually sat outside, which the patio is just beautiful on a AZ October night. I didn't even feel like I was sitting in Phoenix. The restaurant is in a cute historic house and the patio is filled with older trees and plenty of plant life. There was even a cute little white cat running around. I felt like I was sitting in someone's grandma's garden. Someone's grandma who makes kick as freaking food.  For dinner, my party of three of us split the 3 Pair Bruschetta. The waiter made it sound like it was going to be small, but it's not. These are three GOOD sized pieces of bruschetta topped with a ton of toppings. I really enjoyed the Prosciutto one. Melt in your mouth good. Then we split the De Notte pizza. It was a white pizza with spicy salami, mozzarella and tomatoes. The top of the pizza was burnt just enough to give it that perfect flavor. I don't remember the last time, if ever I had a pizza THAT good. I was a little disappointed we didn't get to try a red pizza, but we were plenty full from the appetizer and main entree. Not too full to split a nutella crepe topped with vanilla ice cream..oh yeah baby, can't go wrong with a little nutella in your mouth. That's what she said.  Service was great. Our waiter was quick, despite how busy the place was. He was very friendly and very helpful, except for telling us the brushetta was small not that I'm complaining :). And I think the price was very right. I couldn't believe how inexpensive dinner was for 3 people and all the food plus drinks we had. Very reasonable. I plan on taking the husband there soon!

Blerg.  I went here for the Ignite After Hours event (GREAT EVENT, bad location). I don't like clubs first of all and i DON'T like egotistical bar tenders who think they can treat you like an idiot.   I had 3 drinks at Myst (the same drink) and got charged a different price by each bar tender. The first drink was $5, then the second was $6 and the last guy was the winner for douch-tarded-ness. He told me my drink was $7, but when I got the tab he ran my card for $8. WTF??? So no tip for you...Plus they are all sort of jerky...I'm not into that. You are in the customer service industry, so attempt to be nice. The first bartender I encountered was pleasant, but he disappeared after I ordered my drink. The other two thought they were God's gift and that was the end of that.  Boo you Myst, I will only come back if Ignite After Hours is there again, but not on my own accord.

If Korean food is your thang, this is the best Asian store to go to get your supplies. My husband and I have been to several and while 99 Ranch Market or Lee Lees are LARGE, they don't have the selection of Korean specific food. Makes it hard to make quality Bim Bim Bap or Tak Golgi or Kimchi Chigae! Asiana market on Dobson is Korean specific and has everything we've ever needed to make Korean dishes proper.  The folks are always friendly, though they don't speak very much English. Just know jusaio and cumsumnida and you'll be good ;-) The owner even helped preggo me carry the 20 lb bag of rice to my car! Thanks!

I discovered Performance Auto and Tire Center on accident after Sears Repair center right around the corner were basically big a-holes. I was having issues with my brakes, so I just needed someone to look at them for me and let me know if I needed them fixed. The guys at Performance Auto took my car right in and let me know that I did not need new brakes at all! Loved the honesty.  I've now gone back 4 times for other auto issues (finally getting my brakes fixed :) and I really love the service and the pricing is very fair. When I walk in, it doesn't matter that it has been a few months since I've been there, they know who I am and greet me by name. They always give me a quote quickly, no waiting for hours wondering what's wrong with my car and then waiting around even longer to fix it. My daughter loves the fact that they have free goodies for her to snack on. Okay I admit, the snacks are nice for me too ;).   And if you don't want to sit around waiting for the car repairs, they do have loaners they can give you! Maybe not the nicest cars in the world, but hey, it gets you out of the shop.  I highly recommend Performance Auto if you are looking for a repair shop that is honest, has fair pricing and doesn't take an eternity to get your car fixed. Plus the guys there are really just cool, nice guys.

Recently my Sam's Club membership under my former business expired and I was contemplating renewing on my own. I had pretty much decided to renew once payday came around since I've been a member for 7 years and haven't had too many issues with the store.  Today, however, changed my mind and I will be activating a membership with Costco.   I had purchased 4 brand new tires from Sam's Club last February. About a week ago I noticed that my tire was low, so I put air in it. Then a few days later it was low again,so I knew it needed to be fixed. Without hesitation, I drove to Sam's Club to have the auto center fix it since it was a tire I had purchased from there less than one year ago.  I run in to get out of the rain with my 4 month old baby and approach the service person at the counter, who was definitely not wanting to be working or something, didn't even greet me and acted like I was bothering him. I tell him the scenario and he scans my Sam's Club card. Of course it didn't come up since my membership has expired and I haven't had a chance to renew yet. Immediately he informs me he can't help me, and that's it. So I say, "But I bought the tire from you? Really? You're going to send a woman with a baby back out to drive in a downpour with a flat tire, not even offering to put air in it?" The utter disregard was unbelievable!  So there you have it. I cannot fathom doing business with a company with such horrible customer service.

Fast food is not really my thing, but I really like this Chick-Fil-A. Other than the food being pretty good (amazing for fast food) but they have Family Nights on Thursdays (http://www.cfarestaurant.com/santanvillagemarketplace/events). I assume the other Chick-Fil-A's do as well, but I've only seen them advertised at this particular location. I took my children there tonight and for $15 (cost of dinner) my 5-year old was able to make a sock snowman craft (turned out really cute), have face-painting (by a professional, not a bored teenager) and a balloon animal (or princess, buzz light-year, batman, whatever the case may be). I was thoroughly impressed with the event and can't wait to go back for the next one.  Besides all that, the restaurant was clean. The food was fresh and the chicken wasn't gross. The staff was super friendly and uber polite. I was fan! Great place to spend the evening with your family.

I'm a Mexican food fanatic, and have been having issues finding a place that isn't so BLAH lately. Well, luckily I had the privilege to try out Cien Agave for a promo video we filmed and I was impressed!   First I was able to try out the shrimp ceviche...a-ma-zing. It was so fresh and very light in the citrus. Too many times you get a ceviche that is over-powering in the lime juice, but Cien Agaves' is perfectly refreshing.  Then we were able to try out the shredded beef taco, lobster taco, and the Taco Al Pastor. I'm not usually a shredded beef taco fan, but let me just say that I've been craving it ever since. And what's even better is you can get them for $1 every Tuesday! And the Taco Al Pastor (marinated pork and grilled pineapple) was to die for. Yum yum yum. Can I go now please???  And of course the margaritas...they have reeeeeeeaaaaaaaaalllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyy good margaritas. I enjoyed the award winning house margarita...its a really great classic margarita, where they freshly squeeze the citrus, no pre-made crap in it at all. So good. And the cucumber margarita was amazing.   Cien Agaves is just a really great little treasure in Old Town Scottsdale. They have a great atmosphere and a great staff. Go check them out.

Ok, I really liked this place. It's been eight hours since I had lunch there and my mouth is still happy.  My husband and I on a whim, decided to have a rare week-day lunch together and go for some sushi. Wanting to try a new place, we headed over to Sushi Eye.  We were greeted by the owners, a Korean couple, who was very nice and welcoming. Our waitress was very sweet and she was quick to get our orders in and our drinks on the table. By the way, I tried their bottled Ginger Peach Black Tea and it was sooooo good. Not sweet at all, which is how I love my teas, just a natural flavor.  Anyway...  We ordered a side of edamame, which is pretty much going to be good anywhere you go.  Then we ordered four rolls: Cherry Blossom (my fave!), The Elliot, Spicy Scallop and The Atkins.  The Cherry Blossom was soooooo good. I don't remember all what was in it, but I think it was Tuna, avocado and one other item. But it was drizzled with a sauce and coated with Macadamia nuts. I've never seen that before but OMG, delicious!  The Elliot was my hubby's fave. It was eel and it was good, but it was a little sweet for my taste.  The Spicy Scallop was good, but sort of unmemorable. I didn't not like it, but it didn't wow my mouth.  The Atkins was also awesome and different. It was tuna, avocado wrapped in cucumber, but the rice wine vinegar sauce that was drizzled on it put it over the top. OMG, I was licking my lips from that for hours.  Sushi Eye will definitely be a return visit for us.

Had a meeting at Scratch yesterday and I'm in love. I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu items! And especially their desserts...the case full of enticing treats was almost more than I could stand! :)  The whole place was just adorable. I loved the "girly-girl" meets "Retro punk rock" vibe. Who knew something so cute and trendy existed between Subway and Fry's!  The iced mocha I had was great, but their selection of teas and coffees was huge. And their menu looked fabulous. I wasn't too hungry, so I tried the crepes, which were delicious. The food the two gals I was with looked amazing though.   Definitely a "must go back to"!

I had the privilege of getting to try out Ling & Louie's on Shea for work (yes my job is rough), and I really enjoyed it!  The atmosphere is casual and fun and the staff is SO nice. They were very accommodating and attentive. We got to sit next to the kitchen where you can actually see your food being prepared, so you know it's fresh.  The food was great. You can't go in expecting traditional Asian food or PF Changs. The food at Ling & Louie's is more of an Asian meets American Comfort Food. We started out with a shrimp & avocado tempura roll. I thought it was okay, however my friends thought it was fabulous. I was more of a fan of the Emerald Spinach Salad...fresh, light and freakin' tasty! You can't go wrong with strawberries, walnuts and blue cheese.  For entrees, we tried out the crab cakes and the Evil Jungle Princess, which is a signature dish that even has her own twitter handle (@EvlJnglePrinces if you're curious). I enjoyed the crab cakes, but loved the Evil Jungle Princess. It's chicken and fresh veggies in a peanut-red curry sauce.   And if you're in the mood for some drinky drinks, get a Guava Tea. It's Guava Rum meets Arnold Palmer. Light, smooth and refreshing...dangerously deceiving.  Definitely go check them out...you won't be disappointed.

Hello?   Yeah sure, I'd love to go for all you can eat sushi for $20...but I'm sure it's all rice.  What, it's not? Well then you probably can only pick from 3 types of rolls...  What??!! There is a whole bunch of rolls to pick from and they're tasty as hell?   And WHAT? That $20/per person also includes a large selection of appetizers and entrees? I'm freakin' in  No, it was not the best sushi I've ever had, but I've been to Japan. For $20 you can't complain at all. And try the crab puffs...there's actually more crab than cream cheese...holy shiznit!  And to top the evening off, you can buy one beer at regular price ($3.75 for Tsing Tao) and get the second for a penny.  My hubby and I are now fans. Thank you Orient Sushi & Grill!

I lived less than a mile from this delicious gem for almost 2 years, how have I not eaten here?!  The hubster and I wanted to try something new tonight so I suggested FINALLY trying Hot Pot for S&Gs. I'm very glad we did. It's a tiny little place, but extremely clean. The service was quick and friendly. I wasn't there more than 5 minutes! That's a huge plus in my book.  On the recommendation of the owner, I got the oxtail and the Jerk Chicken. Both were cooked perfectly tender and falling off the bone. The oxtail was savory and the jerk chicken had just the right amount of kick to it. And the dirty rice and cabbage sides were delicious.  Definitely will be going back! I'm so excited to find another great local restaurant so close to home!

I'm late in writing this review as I was here on August 1st, but I wanted to make sure I put my voice out there.   My good friend held my baby shower at The Mission and it was just amazing. High class all the way. First off I just loved the decor, it was elegant and fun at the same time. The illuminated salt bricks were very cool and I just liked the trendy feel of the place.  Brian, the owner, went above and beyond to make sure that we got the "back room" for my shower so we could have privacy. They even printed up our own menu's specifically for us. We had our own wait staff who was very prompt and helpful. We felt very important the whole time we were there.  Even though I couldn't partake in the mimosa bar we had set up, my friends all said it was wonderful, as well as the mojitos...I'll have to go back to partake :)  For my breakfast, I ordered Chilaquiles, which was fried corn tortillas topped with red chile pork, fried egg and cotija cheese. They were delicious. I think there could have been a little more pork on them, but for the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed them. It was like breakfast nachos, and who doesn't like nachos. The other dish that looked unbelievable was the Cinnamon Pecan Waffles topped with cinnamon helado. Oh my goodness...if I could have eaten two dishes, I would have definitely ordered those as well! They just looked tempting. For dessert we had the Espresso churros. The churros were okay...a little too crispy, they would have been better if they were served warmer and  if they were softer. But the milkshake that came with it was great! Very creamy and just plain yummy.  I plan on going back when not pregnant so I can also try out the tequila bar! There are so many things on the menu I can't wait to try. Definitely had a great overall experience at the Mission!

I can't believe I forgot to write my review for Kelly!   I've had Kelly's cupcakes at several events and have always LOVED them. They are always so decadent and so flavorful. Delicious!  So I contacted her to make my son's first birthday cake. We were doing a Godzilla themed party since that is his nickname. Kelly was so great at communicating with me to get the perfect cake. She was able to take a graphic I had created for his invitations and a t-shirt he wore and put it on the cake. It turned out SO cute. She was even able to make a matching smash cake for my son to tear into.  Plus the cake was delicious. Everyone at the party loved it.   Thank you again Kelly! :)

O..M..G...   This place is SO GOOD! And I love the atmosphere...it's just very cool, chilled and laid back. I love the church pew bench seating and the doors as tables. The service staff was great, fast and friendly. The place was so clean and just bright and airy. I would love to come back for their happy hour sometime and try all their imports. Loved all the historical facts in the menu. Just an all around cool place.   As for the food...delish. My husband and I split The Italian and The Bangers and Mash. First off the crust on both was amazing. What a great flavor, and crispy yet soft at the same time.   The Italian was pretty good for being in a British place. If you're looking for a Stromboli or calzone, stick with La Famiglia or Old Chicago, but for the most part, it was pretty damn tasty. Loved the roasted tomatoes on it.   The Bangers and Mash..well I had my half of that second, and I'm so glad I did. I'm still savoring the delicious red wine gravy that you pour over the pasty. And I'm always a mashed potato fan. The sausage had an excellent flavor and the whole thing just went together nicely. Yum...SO GOOD.   I can't wait to back and try more!   Oh and a really cool feature...the waitress noticed my husband was on his lunch hour and we were sort of hurried, so she gave us a menu and said next time we come to order ahead and they'd have them ready when we got in. I love that kind of service.   Definitely will be going back.

I freaking LOVE mojo yogurt. Seriously. I go there with my daughter about once a week. She doesn't even ask for ice cream anymore, she just asks if we can go to Mojo Yogurt, and who am I to deny anyone of love in a cup.  Plus its always surprise to go and find out what flavors they will have each week. I know you can look them up online, but I like to be surprised. I've been extremely partial to the fruity flavors lately, like the passion fruit, the coconut and the apple..omg the apple was SO good!  Service is always very friendly and you should DEFINITELY follow them on twitter @mojoyogurt. Trust me you should.  So yeah, if you haven't tried out Mojo, you really should. Right now. Go.

This place is adorable. Loved loved loved Smeeks. You just can't help but happy and light-hearted in this brightly decorated sweet shop. The candy jars are so inviting and the selection of treats is amazing. I was very excited to find candy's I haven't seen in years or can't get in the United States! I had so much fun going around and filling my goody bag. Better than trick or treating!  I have to go back for some of the other amazing products I saw. There is a gift for everyone there!  I didn't think that it was too pricey for a novelty shop at all. If you want a 50 cent snickers bar, then go to Circle K! There are plenty of treats for under a dollar at Smeeks though, so come on down!

I love me some Jade House. You know you're going to get some good Chinese when you walk in and everything is written in Chinese. And yes, the language barrier is difficult, but its okay. Just be very patient when phoning in your order. It can take a bit.  My husband and I do enjoy trying out some of the authentic dishes there...the ones we can't pronounce. Very fresh and very delicious.  BUT their american-ized dishes are amazing too. Sometimes you are just looking for some good American Chinese food, and this place is the best. They still use very fresh ingredients in their dishes and you can't beat the prices on their lunch specials or combo plates. $4.95 for an entree, eggroll, crab puff, fried rice and a soup or drink. It's enough food to feed me and my two small kids! I love their orange beef, shrimp in lobster sauce, chicken and veggies, and the cashew chicken. Well pretty much anything I've tried there.  And I'm hugely in love with their wonton soup. They use huge wontons and its filled with large pieces of fresh vegetables in a delicious broth. When I'm sick, I have my husband go and pick up a quart. Better than chicken noodle soup! :)

So I was totally worried that Lolo's wouldn't live up to the hype. Everyone has been talking about it and it's pretty trendy to go eat there, so my husband and I were excited but reserved about finally trying it. I have to say though, Lolo's totally came through. Seriously the BEST fried chicken I've ever had. I don't normally like fried chicken, but now I realize that's because I haven't had really good fried chicken before!  The only bad thing about the experience was the wait to be seated (especially with a hungry 3-year old) but that's only because of the popularity. They made up for the fast service. Literally minutes after we ordered, we had piping hot food in front of us.   Hubby and I both stuck to the theme of the restaurant and ordered the Lil' Amadi (chicken thigh & leg and 1 waffle). The chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. As you bit in you got the crunch and then the steam came out...it was amazing. The waffle was cooked to perfection. Slight crispy and golden brown. The batter they used was delicious. I loved the cinnamon or nutmeg or whatever it was in it. We ordered my daughter mac & cheese and i had to steal a bite. So very cheesy and creamy. Some of the best mac & cheese I've had in a long time. And then we also ordered two corn muffins because I saw them go by and I had to try one. They were heaven. So moist and a great flavor. I will never make my own corn bread again because I just can't make it that good, lol.  And finally I was happy because they had Pepsi products (very few restaurants do) and my daughter and husband were ecstatic to have Red Kool-aid in a jar.  The staff was friendly and very prompt. Our jars were never more than half empty and they kept us stocked in napkins :)  All in all, an excellent experieince and if you haven't gone yet, you should.

I've found my new baby store! Sorry BabiesRUs, Buy Buy Baby is just a better shopping experience, plus it's closer to me to boot! The store is extremely clean and organized. They have a larger selection of everything! And the rooms in which to feed and change your child are so much more cleaner and, sorry, they smell better. It's not more expensive than BRU, but it feels more upscale for sure.  I also felt that the staff was far more knowledgeable about the product. The employee that helped me with my stroller purchase went through and showed me how every single stroller I was interested in worked and talked about all the features on each one. I was wondering if they had some stroller school or something! And there was 2 salespeople for every section. Every time I turned around someone was there to help me out or ask me if I was finding everything okay.  Then after I was done, without me even asking, an employee was carrying out my purchase to the car since I had my four year old and my 6 month old with me.   It was just a great experience overall and I was very please. Pregnant moms...register here!  And yes they offer coupons and they also take competitors coupons! AND they accept coupons from Bed Bath & Beyond, so if you get those 20% off coupons that BBB sends, you can use them at Buy Buy Baby!

My favorite thing about 5th and wine is the location itself. I love the decor, I love the comfortable feeling, and just the overall ambiance. I could totally see myself going down there every day and hanging out on one of the couches eating a ghiradelli brownie and drinking a glass of pinot noir. Too bad I have responsibilities like children ;)  The apple, brie, fig jam and honey/agave drizzled brushetta is SO good. A perfect start to any meal. The green apples are crisp and the home made fig jam is sweet, and the brie is creamy. My mouth is watering thinking about it!  For an entree I tried the pesto chicken pasta. Very very good...it's deliciously creamy without being to heavy chicken dish. Chef Steven Butler makes his own pesto sauce and it's amazing.  Then of course you have to try some of the wines. They are great at telling you which wine pairs best with each dish, so you will never be disappointed in the flavors.  Definitely a new favorite restaurant of mine!

Today my family attended the performance of Aladdin Jr put on by the wonderfully talented children at Spotlight Youth Theater. It  is not a place you would notice from the street. Its located within a tiny strip mall, not containing much else. The theater itself is not large at all, but the spirit of the kids that perform there made it feel much larger.  My daughter, 4, thoroughly enjoyed the performance and LOVED that it was put on by children. The kids performing were very talented and I was very impressed with costumes and the set design for such a small production. The show we saw today was fun and colorful. My entire family (including my mom and her husband, all my siblings, my step-sister and her daughters) all had such a fantastic time. We definitely would love to go back.  For not knowing what we were going to, this modest theater really impressed us. I highly recommend catching a show there...it is even worth the drive from the East valley.  Go do it Phoenix! You won't be sorry.

Happened to go into Barro's tonight because it was next to Target and SuperCuts, and the kids were hungry, so pizza it is!  This location used to be Godfather's Pizza and they have done a complete overhauls. New tables, booths, dark wood furniture, tile, the works. It looks nice, but its also comfortable for the family.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful, so all in all a nice place to go in for dinner with the family.  Tonight we had hot wings, which were pretty good. Not the best I've had and far from the worse, just good.  The hubs and I ordered a small BBQ Chicken pizza to share and then two french bread pizza stick kids meals for our rugrats. My kids are both big pizza eaters, but one kids meal would have sufficed. The french bread pizza sticks were a foot long...definitely big enough for my 5 and 2 year old to share.   The BBQ pizza was  delicious, except for maybe a touch too much BBQ  sauce..I would request light sauce next time. The crust was puffy and yummy.  Definitely a place we'd go back to.  Oh and if you want to go get take out, then you can order a nice cold beer on tap and watch a game while you wait. :)

So...there are dive bars and there are trashy bars. This one was the latter.   First off, I will preface that I was probably too old for this bar...I will fully admit that.   A friend and I were in the area tonight and decided we wanted to have a quick drink so we could chit chat. We saw Betty's and thought "Its open and it looks pretty quiet" so we stopped in.  The place was cutesy I guess and could be fun on a busy weekend night, but when its empty it just sort of looks sad.  The waitress approached our table quickly, but as she was taking our order she was lifting up the hem of her belly shirt and was scratching. Nice...classy...  I ordered a rum and diet coke. The coke was flat and I'm pretty sure the rum came from a plastic bottle. All for $7. Awesome. Well worth the money. For $7 I could have bought the same bottle of rum and a 2 liter of diet coke AND it would have had the fizz...  My friend asked for a glass of wine, which she should have known better, lol. Our waitress looked confused and had NO clue what kind of wine there was. There's a white one "I think... chardonnay?" Oh dear lord. And yeah, you guessed it $7 for something that could have possibly been a Chardonnay. But you know, like, wine is for old people, for sure.  So anyway, we sort of finish our drinks and decide to head out. We tried to flag down the waitress to pay our tab, but that was next to impossible. She was after all dealing with some "crazy-ass customers." Her words, not mine.  So she comes over and looks at our card and says, "Oh we have a minimum of a $20 order to use a card. There is an ATM over there." Oh for pete's sakes. My friend just looks at her and says "I'm sure there is someone you can ask to see if we could just run the card this one time." Sure enough there was, so we did. You get a star for that.  So then we try to sign the bill and the pen doesn't work. I take the pen to the bar (our waitress was busy with the "crazy-ass customers" again) and I swear to God the bartender tested the pen as if I was lying about it. Just hand me a new pen honey.  Visiting this bar was like one giant joke. Pretty sure its not my scene, so no worries of ever going back.

I was able to go try SmashBurger for the first time the other night at the Sin City Burger VIP Party. I have to say, it was pretty darn good.   Staff was super friendly and helpful in letting us know what they're favorites were. The location is clean and very contemporary, but it still had a 50's burger joint feel. I liked it.  My husband and I both ordered the Sin City burger, since it was the guest of honor. I got the 1/3 lb (there was a 1/2 lb available too) and it was stacked with sauteed onions, thick cut apple wood bacon, a fried egg and then their shoestring onion rings on top of a golden kaiser roll. Holy crap, the 1/3 was huge! I couldn't imagine the 1/2 pounder. I could only eat half (which of course made my husband happy). Anyway...it was good! I was curious about the fried egg aspect, but it was like breakfast on a burger. Burgers good. Breakfast good. My only thing was it was a tad salty for my taste, but luckily for me they had Four Peaks Kilt Lifter available with a frosted cold mug. :) :) :)  We also ordered the rosemary fries and the shoestring onion rings on the side. I was a fan of the fries...I loves me some rosemary. They were cooked to crispy yet mealy perfection. The onion rings were okay. I liked them better on top of the burger as opposed to the side. Would like to try their sweet potato fries next time.  We were also given the Cactus Vanilla milk shake to try. Again very good, I had no complaints, I just wasn't sure I tasted the cactus. I could have and not known it, but it tasted like a regular vanilla milk shake to me. Next time the hubby and I decided will order a vanilla milkshake and a cactus vanilla and compare. Can't go wrong with two milk shakes too.  Did I mention they had frosted cold mugs for the beer?  So yup, we will go back! Try it, you'll like it!

Amazing. This event was amazing. This was by far the most organized event I have been to in a long time. Kelly and Tracy knocked the socks off of this big time! :)  And excellent job to all the bakers that participated. Every cupcake I tried was delicious.  Thanks to everyone who worked so hard to put on a great day for some great charities.  I can't wait until next year.

This place can kiss my ass. Don't try to sit down at one of the million empty tables. They will try to kick you out. Order a glass of water..$7. really? After the $10 drinks? Eat it.  avoid At all costs

So excited to have a self-serve yogurt shop close to our house, and it's friendly and yummy to boot (get  it, boot...ranch..nevermind).  My family and I have been there twice now and have not been disappointed. Today though, I got to try the honeydew melon mixed with vanilla bean and it was divine. Topped with some fresh fruit and my favorite, cheesecake bites, and it was a perfect afternoon snack.  My daughter had no complaints with any of the goodies to top hers and my husband loved the cake batter yogurt.  Just one request, if they had the little mochi candies, my life would be complete. :)  Oh and they also have a little robotic riding horse  for the  kids (like  little kids, not big stinky teenage boys who recently broke it apparently). It's free and so cute. Goes perfectly with all the ranch-style decorations.

Well, it was fun until they decided to tell my kids they couldn't bounce together anymore. My son had to be on one court while my daughter on another because of their ages. I understand keeping my younger safe when older kids are bouncing, but there was no one else there. Yet my son was bigger than the kids on his age court. Thanks teenage worker, you're doing your job well.  Not much really to do here either. Only came because of a coupon. Won't be back.

I'm in L*O*V*E with this store. I went here for the first time on Wednesday and was back on Saturday. And yes, there is no such thing as just popping in for a minute. It's like a home decor black hole. It's not  huge space, but you can go through the whole store several times  and still see something new on each pass.  There is a lot of iron pieces, but so much more. You can find something for every room of the house, no matter what your taste is. Modern, country, traditional or Victorian! The staff is so helpful...bring in a picture of the space you'd like to find something for and they will find the perfect piece to fill it. True story. The space above my tv is no longer nekkid. No breaking the pocket book either. I usually shy away from these specialty stores because they mark up the product so much, but not here.  I was very very happy that I discovered this store.
