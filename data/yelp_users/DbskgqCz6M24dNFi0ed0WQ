Let me start by saying from the time I pulled up to the place, walked in the courtyard, stepped into the diner and took a seat on one of the 9 stools at the corner of the counter, I was a fan.  This tiny place packs a big punch.  The employees are super friendly and upbeat. There is a sense that they want you to have a great experience while you enjoy eating.   It's got some super items on the menu and they are working on creating a full bar.  They have large multi seat tables that look similar to picnic tables outside under umbrellas so there is more seating of the weather is good. There are several items on the menu I will return to try but on this particular trip, our first, we had the Holy Puerco & the Peanut butter Bacon Cheddar Burger.  Both were amazing.  I felt a bit like I was back in New Orleans with the fried cheddar grit cake, cracklins, & Crystal sauce.  Not to mention the burger reminds me of one of my favorite burger joints in NOLA, Yo Mama's Bar & Grill. They also have a Peanut butter Bacon burger.   I like the list they have on the wall behind the counter that names all the local businesses they purchase there produce, meat, and goods.  It shows the intent to buy local and support other local businesses.   I will be back, I witnesses the making and devouring of a sandwich named Big Jim, a fried chicken breast, country gravy, bacon & cheddar on a large homemade biscuit.  I have got to try that for myself.  So my recommendation to you is to go, eat, experience this little diner for yourselves.  There is soul in the food they serve.   Here is a link to the diner's website:  http://www.marthaandmary.net/welcomediner/welcome.html

Been going there for years, I stuck by them when they got undeserving and inaccurate negative press, and I still love this place. Keep making food I will keep eating it.   My favorite is the Pizza Nortena extra crispy with extra green chilis and 4 sides of the very hot salsa verde (you must request the salsa verde) Green & Red chili are good.  Tacos Morango are great and so are the loaded nachos.  My husband loves the Pollo Blanco Enchiladas. Bring us a pitcher of Margaritas and we are set.

Barb's Bakery delivered our wedding cake last week..  My husband and I met with a representative and we chose the Champagne (Barb's signature cake) and the custard filling with white buttercream frosting and fondant border ribbon. The cake had a scroll design with candied pearls.  Beautiful.  They offered several sizes and styles but we got the perfect size for our champagne reception. We expressly told them we did not want anything on the cake that was not edible.  That request was fulfilled.  Everyone raved about the texture, moistness, flavor, and look of the cake. They matched the fondant ribbon to our invitations perfectly.  It was not overly sweet which was a concern for us. Actually the cake was perfect.  Barb's Bakery has been in the valley for many years.   I have recommended them to many of our friends.  Not just to drive by and get doughnuts but now that we have the right to be legally married in Arizona, Barb's bakery made my husband and I feel comfortable and welcome.  They provided the service they promised and advertise to offer.  No Hassles. If you want cake, go to Barb's.   It helped we had a plan, We brought our iPad with photos of our clothing we chose, we had images of the simple theme we were intending, we brought a spare invitation to provide them, the number of guests, and the consultant took very thorough notes.  Thank you Barb's Bakery you made our cake and Champagne reception perfect!

I am a fan of the Pei Wei chain but the management and consistency is different with each restaurant.  I love the concept, I like the menu and I like the flavor profiles of the individual dishes. You just have to hit the right Pei Wei for the best experience.

Had breakfast there again today with my husband. We go there around 9 am, surprisingly no wait.  I had the special heart healthy omelet with goat cheese, mushrooms, spinach, tomato & onions wrapped in a delicate pocket of egg whites.  I love the biscuits and honey.  We had two super delish Bloody Mary's.  The weather was perfect for dining outside at the Morning Glory Cafe and service was excellent.  Our green shirted gal was prompt and quick witted to combat my sarcasm. If you live in PHX and you have not been you should go.  If you plan to visit from out of town and are looking for a casual outdoor dining experience this winter, no snow, just sweet sunshine here.  The menu has a variety for meet lovers, and healthy eaters. I really treasure this place, it is like an oasis in the desert.

This was a great new dining experience for us.  It is a mix of Greek, Lebanese food.  The owner was our waiter and gave great direction on what the specials were, what he felt would be something we should try.  His sister was in the kitchen making the food so I felt a little like I was in their home despite the restaurant setting.  I had the Lamb osso bucco, it was fantastic, with brown rice, herbed potatoes, & veggies. We also had the falafel, which Christopher loved. It was very good.  The humas with minced beef and pickle was also fantastic.   We had chose this restaurant based on the online reviews and it was close to where an out of town guest was staying but we will be back.  They did all they could to satisfy us and made the promise at our table that if we did not like it we did not pay for it.  They ever brought items we did not order for us to try.  Desert was just ok, they claim to have the best carrot cake you have ever had but, meh... I've had better.  One of the reviewers here on yelp recommended that you order the Lebanese beer, I did. I am passing the recommendation on to you.  GET the Lebanese beer!  It went perfect with the meal. We will be back!

Great place with great food. I like the Diner 50 style. The pancakes are good. the Omelet  was great, crispy hash browns. pork sausage patty was great.  Adriana, the owner served us at the counter and offered homemade hot sauce/ranchero sauce for our eggs and hash browns.  She needs to bottle that stuff it is so good.  I was almost going to give one less star because they did not have Cholula hot sauce but the homemade sauce more than made up for it.  ;) The food is cooked to order and with fresh great tasting ingredients.  You have to give this place a try. Great food, Great service.  Check out www.facebook.com/TheCharlenCafe There are several photos and reviews. They also help homeless, starving children and Vets! Now that is a small business I can support.

This is a local favorite of mine. I am a frequent visitor here.  I really enjoy the Guys, Kevin & Mike, & gals that run the family business.  I am a Pho-natic! The Pho broth is very good, one the best tasting of many of the Pho restaurants I have visited in Phoenix Metro.   The restaurant is very unassuming and not fancy at all. I believe is was a Taco Bell from days gone by.  The family works together to make the restaurant work. The food is fresh and very good.  They are great at recommendations or explaining items to you if you need a bit of help. Take the opportunity to ask questions, step out of the box and try something new. I go there to get my Pho fix.  They also have great espresso they import by way of California, it is very good.  They make a great Viet Coffee with it. They appreciate loyal customers who appreciate their small family business.   Give this place a shot, you will enjoy it.  Update: You have got to try the various flavors of Macaroons that Bihn makes.  We took two boxes of various flavors home, they are terrific.   They were once only available on the weekends but now you can place and order.  Look for the sign near the door or ask inside.

Need Milk?  They've Got Milk!    The milk is great and they use reusable sustainable glass bottles, which in theory makes the milk taste better.  They have milk, flavored milks, egg nog, cheese curds and heavy cream. We bought our milk from Robert who was super friendly and helpful. I told him I was a Yelper and we discussed other places he likes to visit or Yelps about. They had a Panini food truck in the parking lot which had quite crowd gathering around it. Be sure to visit the Dairy's website to learn about all the flavored milks form Root Beer to Arizona Orange. They have two sizes of milk bottles.  They also sell T-shirt and Milk carry bags.  You can get a six of small bottles or a 4 pack of large bottles.  There is a $2 deposits for the bottles, refundable upon return or you can keep the bottles for your own use.  You can buy their products in grocery stores around the valley, however, you do not get the experience of a visit to the dairy.   I have to admit, this dairy is very close to my house so it may be more convenient for me than it would be for others.   This area is known for its cotton, corn, alfalfa  So if you are in Laveen or just would like to make a trip to the dairy to have a cool experience, stop in and get some milk.  This area has long been know for its cotton alfalfa, corn and dairy farms.  However, with major urban development in recent year has diminished that but we are still proud or our dairies. As the locals here like to say, even printed on bumper stickers: Come to Laveen and smell our 'Dairy-Air'.  Update 02/13/14:  They now have Mocha Milk!

This is one of the best Indian restaurants I have been to in the valley.  It has been here as long as I can remember. since the dearly 90's I think.  Do yourself a favor skip the buffet and go for dinner.  Buffets do not hold the same quality as individual meals.  The benefit of a buffet would be to experience as much as the restaurant has to offer. If you do go, you must get the traditional Delhi dish Murgh Makhani (ButterChicken). This dish supposedly was invented in old Delhi and became famous at a restaurant there. It is a butter tomato masala sauce that takes time to make correctly. You seriously will not be disappointed.  I am salivating right now thinking about it. Get a couple orders of garlic naan.  Get some Indian tea, basically a chai tea with milk. Venture out of you comfort zone and try any of the dishes you see on menu.   On your way out the door stop for just a few fennel seeds to clear you pallet and ease digestion. I will continue to return to for the awesome food and the cheeky, tacky décor and bad lighting.

Although we have been going to Durant's for years, we chose Durant's as one of our AZ Restaurant week pick.  It is of course one of our favorite places. Durant's has a veritable plethora of cliental.  During restaurant week you may sit next to someone who frequents Durant's or someone who is experiencing it for the first time, as we did.  It can be difficult not to give direction but the staff is very good at pointing you the way.  We are fortunate to have made acquaintance with a few of the wait staff. One or two I have known prior to there tenure at Durant's. It is coveted and difficult to get a job at Durant's, you must wait for someone to leave and that rarely happens.  One person I really miss is John, the bartender, who served for over 40yrs.  He was an icon at Durant's. When I was younger and had a lot less money I often sat at the bar with friends and chatted with him over a martini.  He taught me some tricks and life lessons in his quiet way. I had my fist and possibly last taste ever of the most amazing liquid desert, Louis XIII de Remy Martin, cognac. When you have waiters who are dedicated, dressed, able to interact one on one with each type of client, they bring you the best food & drinks, how can you go wrong?  If you want the feel of a good old classy chop house, that has the character, this is the place.  There are some other Steakhouses that offer great stakes, however, Durant's will remain my favorite for more personal reasons. I prefer the Rib-eye or Delmonico depending on my mood. Hit Durant's at lunch and have one of their burgers. If you like chicken livers give those a try here, my friends dad, who is Greek, even got the chef to wrap them in bacon for us one time. Talk about heart attack but boy were they good.  The Oysters Rockefeller are great.  If you get to visit when Stone Crabs are in at Durant's, take advantage of the Stone crabs they offer. Or get the Crabs and Steak.  They offer and extensive fine wine list. My recommendation for red wine drinkers like myself, check out the wine list on their website prior to dining. When you arrive at to dinner, have them open the wine and let it breath at your table. This way it will come to temperature out of the cellar and open up for a much more enjoyable taste with your meal.  I always order the salad with Roquefort, Durant's house dressing.  However, on this last visit Christopher ordered the shrimp bisque and it was amazingly rich and tasty.  Once yearly in late spring they offer a few bottles from their end of bin list.  Great bottles at half the price. I am pretty sure that is in the month of May.  I can go on about the food and the dining experience but just go there and have your own experience, taste it.  From the time you enter through the rear kitchen door and are greeted with smiles & welcomes from the wait & kitchen staff you will get to the Maitre D' with a smile already on your face as your eyes adjust to the surroundings of dark wood and red toile wallpaper.  Hey, get there early and hit the bar for your favorite cocktail. With the new no smoking laws in AZ you won't get the cigar or cigarette smoke that reminds me of the old days sitting at the bar with friends, talking to John. Good Friends, Great Steaks ,& the Best Booze, are the necessities of life.   -Jack Durant, Founder.

First review for AZ88, however, by far not my first time there nor my last. So let me tell you some History.  In the 1950's Elsa Kopp founded Kopp's Custard Stand in Milwaukee, WI after her husband Karl Kopp developed Parkinson's. By the 1960's it was a popular Milwaukee staple. Elsa's son Karl Kopp is now the owner of Kopp's as well as Elsa's on the Park, located in downtown Milwaukee across the street from Cathedral Square Park, Bar 89 in SoHo NYC (which unfortunately is now closed) and AZ88, Scottsdale, AZ.  AZ88 is named after the State of residence and the year it was opened.  AZ88 as well as the other two restaurants are knew for the somewhat avant garde art work installations in the mostly white walled interiors.  They all have similar menus and offer similar pricing and upscale cocktails.  They are all similar styles with a bar on onside of the restaurant with high ceilings, white washed walls and contemporary furniture.  I have only been to Elsa's On The Park a couple of times but it was the least pretentious.  You will more likely spot a celeb or well know locals at AZ88.  AZ88 and Bar 89 are both frequented by the gay community. One New York restaurant review described Bar 89, palatial as a Grecian Bathhouse with unisex stalls.  You will find AZ88 has a his, a hers and a his/hers restroom.  DJ music from above and floor to ceiling windows that also over look a park at the Scottsdale Civic Plaza.  Just go for cocktails or sit and eat inside or on the patio.  It can get busy nights and weekends, they do not take reservations.  Of course I love the AZ88 chicken sandwich with waffle cut fries and fruit, the AZ88 Chicken salad and the Tuna Nicoise salad.  Actually all the sandwiches are good. The martinis are excellent.  They have a wide range of liquor and offer a variety of top shelf. So, if you prefer a Johnny Walker Blue or the high end Louis XIII de Remy Martin Cognac (they do have a bottle, I was there few days ago) you will not be disappointed.  Or just get a Grey Goose Martini dry and up, I promise they don't use vermouth unless you ask for it.  If you want to beat the crowds and avoid the pushing and shoving at the bar go during the afternoon on a Sunday. Also if you get a chance stop into a Kopp's      https://www.kopps.com

I love this place!  When we lived in the neighborhood we were regulars. Located in the Historic Melrose Neighborhood, Copper Star opened around 2006 when the neighborhood was barely gentrifying.  Businesses were slowly beginning to open and the 7th Ave corridor between Indian School and Camelback was changing.  Now it is a thriving neighborhood.   Owner Bill Sandweg, who brought a range of experience with him such as, TGI Friday's Pizza Uno, Oregano's, & Starbucks, opened a coffee shop in an old Service station.  He found local coffee roasters, got quality teas and slowly built his business with changes and additions every year, making what it is today. I just spoke with Bill a couple days ago who said 2014 was a terrific year for Copper Star, their best. That is thanks to the growing loyal customers as well as Copper Stars success. As businesses began to open Bill joined and his board members help grow small business association for that neighborhood. He is a committee member on the HTJ (Hotter Than July) Chili cook-off & salsa fest. During the Melrose Street Fair you can always stop in for a Iced Coffee or Iced Tea.  Basically Bill is just an all-around good guy. He cares about the neighborhood and the quality of his business.  He has hired a lot of young folks as baristas.  I am sure he has help put a few through college while working there.  I have never had a bad cup of coffee there. At one point they had punch cards you could redeem for a free drink. There were so many people named Mark in the rolodex box, I had Bill change my name to Zeus so they could find my card with less hassle. This is a people, pet, and neighborhood friendly place.  They do have a unique drive-thru, however, I never use the drive through.   I hold a firm opinion that if you intend to visit any coffee shop you should step inside the business. Most quality coffee shops are more than just coffee, they each hold a unique atmosphere or experience. Take time out of your busy day, step inside, you'll get the entire coffee making experience.  Beyond the coffee they have breakfast sandwiches and pastries or light food menu. They have art installations and on some occasions live music. If you attend First Fridays on Melrose, you can stop in for a drink. Kudos to Copper Star for creating a successful local small business that everyone can enjoy and feel welcome.

My partner found this out of the way gem in a crappy small strip mall. Park in back.  Doesn't look like much from the outside but the nice faux finish décor and segregated dining areas on the inside make up for it.  We had the Pollo Especial and The combination Red & Green chili plates. The red chili is amazing.  I am typically more interested in chili verde but the red chili is terrific. Be sure to request corn tortillas with this plate instead of the usually served flour tortillas.  The bean and rice are great.  The rice is moist & flavorful. If you are choosing between the queso dip and the spicy bean dip, go with the bean dip it does have cheese in it with great flavor, not too spicy either.  The Pollo plate is great, it is one of the most popular dishes on the menu, however, to me the least Mexican.  Try the steak or chicken picado.  I did not try the menudo but everyone around us was ordering it, which looks delicious.  We were there on a Sunday around noon, shortly after we were seated & ordered the place began to fill up. By the time we left there were several parties waiting for tables. There is a nearby church and everyone was there following services.  So if you go on Sunday for lunch, get there by noon.  The food has incredible taste and is quite authentic.  There are a lot of Mexican restaurants in Phoenix Metro as you can imagine, but there are not a lot of good Mexican restaurants.  This is a very good restaurant.  The salsa is made fresh daily & you can tell, it has great flavor (I would prefer it more spicy). Our waitress was great, smiling, attentive, and serviced well.   Next time I will order a bowl of the Red Chili with corn tortillas.  I don't need the rice and beans just a giant bowl of that delicious Red Chili.

Tomaso Maggiore, Has run Tomaso's for 35 years, since 1977,  this well know (voted best Italian Phoenix yearly) restaurant on the Camelback corridor has the goods.  You can find great Tuscan or Sicilian wines. The food is fantastic. During our meal this evening with a AZ Restaurant week pri fix menu we had the Burrata & Dates as well as the Pasta Pillows drown in a sage butter sauce. For the Entrée we had the Sweet potato gnocchi and stuffed veal. Dessert we had the tiramisu and chocolate crunch cake. The food was perfectly cooked. Often gnocchi can be over cooked, gluten chewy. Ours was perfect.  The veal was stuffed with cheese, accompanied with a mushroom demi glaze which was so awesome.  All was delicious! Our bottle of wine with dinner was the Super Sicilian Luxus 5. Tomaso, On one of his many trips to Sicily, he met by chance Giovanni Maggio, who shared the same dream. In 1994 in Agrigento Sicily, a vineyard of 150 acres was born featuring wines with the bold, natural flavors of the land, and a complexity that ensured its success. Maggiore's Luxus 5 Meritage is a blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Nero D'avola, 13% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot and 7% Syrah.  A dry, medium intensity. The flavors are quite complex and include red cherries, red plums, vanilla, black pepper, clove and liquorice. The service was great, it pays to have employees with longevity who are dedicated to the task. Here are some facts from Tomaso's web site that makes you appreciate him even more: Tomaso's opened its doors on September 10, 1977 at 3:59PM Tomaso's has served over 10 million locals & visitors over the past 35 years Hundreds of thousands of Arizona residents have celebrated their birthdays, anniversaries, first dates and even weddings at Tomaso's. Tomaso's has supported 100s of local non-profits, schools and charities. Year after year, Tomaso's has been voted the Best Italian Restaurant in Arizona. Over the past 35 years, Tomaso's has provided employment for 1000s of Arizonans.  Many of our past team members have gone on to become successful  restauranteurs, lawyers, doctors, business and community leaders. At Tomaso's, the best is yet to come!

This historic place cannot be replaced.  The Owners Keith and his wife Anita are so incredibly kind and neighborly.  You do not get friendly, personal conversation at most convenient stores or corner markets; at Del Monte Market you will.  They know the majority of their regulars by name.  They know about your trips you take, your anniversaries, and genuinely hope all is well with you when visit.  Please disregard Mackenzie F., she clearly is not from the area and is not familiar with store.  They host events like car shows, they have fundraisers, on 02/21/15 they will host a swap meet and The Panini People Truck http://thepaninipeople.com/  will be there. They still offer a hitching post so you can ride your horse down and hitch up while inside.  They have a large number of locals that buy Lottery tickets here. They have a good share of posted winners.    The most important things to me about Del Monte Market are the owners ( they are awesome!), the Laveen/SoPho locals who keep go there and support it and the fact they have not destroyed this historic place to build a Walgreens or Condos.  Along with Grandma's Farm, Local Dairies, Bee Apiaries/ Honey Stands, T-Bone Steak House, Scooptacular and Laveen Farmers Market we need to keep all the local small businesses we can.

I don't have a lot of positive comments but no hate either.  I just think it's a tourist trap that has been here for years and gone down hill. It is over priced, and the food is not that great.  The salsa was ok.  I am not super fussy when it comes to Mexican food but I do know good Mexican food.  It sure can be hard to find great Mexican food in Phoenix (of all places).  Explain that to me. The service we had was great, nice young man.  I do not know if because the property surrounding the restaurant has changed hands so frequently, that has had something to do with the quality of food at this place but I remember 20 yrs ago the food was much better.  I would not recommend this place to any friends or out of town guests.  We will not be returning.  The food is boring.

I am not a food critic, I am more of a traveling foodie.  So, from the reviews & comments asserting this restaurant has the best chicken fried steak & green chili in Phoenix, that did not hold true for me.  The food was not bad but not great. The combination omelet I had was quite good. The hash browns were ok but the oil used to fry them tasted old. The pancakes were just ok.  The service was friendly. You get the atmosphere a decent local establishment that certainly has its following. They make their own hot sauces which I tasted.  We went to try some place new. I am glad we did but it was a drive. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back anytime soon.

Prime rib celebration dinner with my husband, newly married and our best friend visiting from out of town.  You can count on Charleston's to provide, excellent service and consistent quality food preparation.   Though it may be a chain, I have not had a bad experience or meal here. The menu has a great variety.  The restaurant makes for cozy casual dining and conversation.

If you are a Pho-natic like I am you will really like this place.  The broth is fantastic. They cook the beef bones and herb/spice broth for nearly 24hr.  The meet is fresh and tender. Lots of noodles and friendly service.  One of the owners came to our table and had us try a few new things. It was refreshing to see a place the gets great reviews and stands up to its reputation. I would certainly visit again.

This is like stopping into a joint on Bourbon St., I get transported back to Louisiana when I eat here.  The food is great. You will want to try everything on the menu like we did, but I worn you, there is plenty of food and you will be rolling out the door.  In AZ this is the closet thing I have tried that is like be in NOLA.  Just go, Eat, and you will see for yourself. It's good!

This place has been here forever. Well not really forever, but we do like to use that term for a place that has been in your city for and exceptional amount of time.  Though it has changed names from Pho Bang to Pho Thanh, it still serves good pho.  The place has expanded to the space next door and it was updated slightly with the new name and ownership.  Most all entrée items are worth the try and the Pho Tai is most certainly a perfect choice.  The staff that serves and cleans may seem unfriendly or miserable but they will get you what you want.  Get vocal and do not feel intimidated, just do not be rude.  I have never had an issue here but then again don't have to look at the menu to order what I want.  Pho & Viet Coffee on a late Sunday morning is a very traditional thing so give it a shot.

I have nothing negative to say about El Chorro.  They improved and the food is always good.  Over the years going there has been fun brunch with friends.  I have never had bad service here.  There has been ownership changes over the years and improvements to the property and food. Those darn Bloody Mary's are fantastic.   If you are from out of town and have not had the chance to stop in, please do. This along with Lon's Hermosa are two of my favorite brunch spots.  during cooler months when you can enjoy the outdoors, they have fantastic patio dining.

Sa Bai is good Thai fusion.  I like more tradition "home style" Thai but I had ordered the Chicken Basil spicy and the Thai spicy noodles made with Chow Fun noodles.  That was great and I enjoyed it.

Ok I cannot really genuinely review this place because it is a buffet.   Eat! tons of food and choices. Well maintained and freshly renewed by the staff. Some days this place is packed other days it is not so packed but always busy. It is one the best buffets I have been to in Phoenix Metro. I am not a fan of the buffet but I can put up with this one,  They have most of the items I enjoy at a Chinese buffet

This place has some great Cambodian food.  Some of the dishes of course are French/Khmer mix influenced.  I love it all.  If you go here try any of the more traditional dishes.  Keep in mind it can be very difficult to find any Cambodian restaurants so try it. As some one who lived among the Cambodian people, ate in their homes, learnd their history, language, traditions, attended weddings as if I were family, this place is quite authentic.  They also have pride the the Kampuchean or current day Cambodian heritage by the interior, decoration, numerous travel books, & informative literature placed in the seating area for anyone to take a look at.  Go try the food, it will make you happy.

Fist time to Rice Paper today.  The broth is good!  We sampled an assortment of Spring rolls; Buddha, Tuna, & Traditional which were fresh, good sized rolls.  Along with those, the fried crab wontons rolls.  Pho tai was tasty well balanced with meat, noodles and broth. The Thai basil, bean sprouts, limes, & mint were all very fresh. I presume they grow the herbs themselves.  They have a Grandma sauce which is ground chili in oil with garlic. It is spicy and flavorful.  A tip: they have "happy hour" & the drinks are very affordable. They also take a dollar off the appetizers and spring rolls which are similar to a sushi/tapas menu allowing you to try a variety of rolls. The service was friendly and prompt. In all it was a great meal with good value and decent service.  I will be back!

Everything we had was awesome, very fresh and tasty.  It is a bit on the high end where pricing is concerned but I was not disappointed. Our friends introduced us to the place and we had a great time with Sake Bombers, as you can imagine.

I had high hopes and expectations when I was invited to Dierks' new bar for a bachelor/bachelorette party.  I know we are in AZ, Scottsdale, but I thought it was a country bar and it ain't!  Its a typical Scottsdale crowd bar. I knew, that because it was Scottsdale, people would be in shorts and t-shirts.   I was still hoping it was a little country so I put on my big boy pants (wranglers) a polo shirt and my Dan Post lace ups to try and be very casual. We were overdressed. Most people barely had clothing on.  Most had tanks, shorts, & flip flops.  UGH, flip flops in a bar?  Shoes people, please. The bar was packed and most the bar staff did not look like they were in the mood to deal will all the drunk idiots.  There were a lot of them.  It is not a Country bar like you might think, with Dierk's name on it.  You must check out the website. http://dierkswhiskeyrow.com     It is more like a sports bar than a country bar, though they do have live scheduled shows.  The food other people in our party ordered was good.  It all looked great. I did not eat, this visit.  I noticed several people giving 5 star reviews, I have a different standard.  The space is beautiful a typical trendy place for Scottsdale.  For God sake, do not wait in line to get in people. There are 50 bars within a ten block radius.

Finally Stacy got his bar and he has made it fabulous.  I love the bar, I love Stacey. Thank goodness the Melrose is keeping up the gayborhood in nice fashion.  There is a large patio, dance floor, bar area and seating lounge. Everyone is welcome, it's a friendly atmosphere. The place is a success. Thanks Stacy, we love ya!  Well and you know, if you've lived in Phoenix for quite sometime, some of you may remember that this was once a bar called Fosters back in the day.  Well if you stop into Stacy's you just may get a drink served to you by the man himself, Mr. J. Foster.

Best pancakes, sorry Matt's big Breakfast, it's true.  Good breakfast choices, local ingredients and Melrose Small Business makes it a hit.  They have Cholula & a special California, chili only sauce that is very tasty.  I only recommend they add Chilaquiles to the menu because I am selfish and I love Chilaquies or Southwestern style Migas.  Give this place a shot, the new location on 7th Ave. makes it a bit more convenient and the food is good.

First time there for lunch today with friends.  They had been before, I have not.  It was great pizza and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  From what I understand the wood fire pizza oven is imported from Italy by way of New York.  It was formerly used in one of Mario Batali's restaurants.  The sauce, meets and cheeses are fantastic and if you love authentic Italian pizza as much as I do you need to check this place out.  The service is good.  Of course at lunch it can be busy but the service is good.  They do not want you to wait but know the food is good so you should. Chef-Owner, Justin Piazza, assured us he would secure a table for us quickly despite the heavy Friday lunch crowd.  Thank goodness my friends faces are regulars, he came out of the kitchen to greet us. I had the Montanara, and it was so good. My friend had the Italian Stallion and it was also fantastic, great for meat lovers.  I would like to go back and seriously, try one of everything on the menu.   They intend to add outdoor seating with a railed patio that runs the store front which will be nice.

We had an awesome dinner, just the two of us.  We arrived and were told it was going to be a 25 min wait, which on a Saturday night that was expected.  We sat at the bar and started to order a couple classes of wine from the bar tender Edward but they had just texted us for our table.  There was only a 5 minute wait, awesome! We were seated in the bar, where there were no children, awesome! We each had a pasta dish Chicago Penne Alla Vodka and Rosted Butternut squash & Brussels sprout penne, with cheesy garlic bread.  Glasses of wine for $5, awesome! Christopher ordered the tempting Red Velvet Ding Dong, it is exactly what you think. It is a square, not round, Red Velvet cake dipped in dark chocolate.  Holy crap it was good. I for one do not order dessert at restaurants unless they appear exception to me. I am often disappointed.  In this case my compliments to the pastry Chef, this cake was super moist and tasty without being too sweet.  I ordered the Trios Cabernet Sauvignon, which was super tasty.  Pops had the Chianti. The service was great and we simply enjoyed a great meal. As a bit of recommendation, if you have not eaten at Spinato's before you must give it a try. The sauce is has great flavor, the Pizzas are great and so is the pasta. If you have not been to the original locale in Tempe you should see where it all started. It is in an industrial area and they do not serve alcohol at this location. It opened in 1986. The Central or North Central Phoenix location opened in 1994, has since moved from the well know 12th St and Glendale location to the new building built where Manuel's Mexican food once stood, at the corner of 7th St. & Missouri. It is in my opinion a far better location. The new building is beautiful. It has increased the size of the restaurant and the parking is much better.  However, I do like the intimacy of the old location. As a local, it made me feel like it was my restaurant and not just another commercial space.  Spinato's has great pizza, pasta, salads, and appetizers. They still serve up authentic Chicago style Italian food even though they have been making pizza in the valley since 1974.

This place rocks!  My first time there. I explained to them I am a foodie and Yelper. Our young waitress gave us a menu to keep and photograph.  She offered her opinion on several items. I think maybe you should try everything on the menu. we ordered 5 different items to get a taste of several dishes. All of it was so great. Pig, yep they have pork fat, bacon, pieces of tasty pig.  If you don't want pig they have veggies.  Tons of veggies, beats, which I love. Just go there and eat.  We were given free desert to try.  I usually never order desert but it would be rude to not accept.  It was a Key-Lime cheese cake.  I liked it but expressed, I prefer it more tart with more lime pulp or flavor. If it don't make ya pucker... They made certain we had a good meal and great service.  I will go back again.  I was also informed they offer discounts on wines at certain times.  We went for brunch and I got an espresso which had superb flavor.

This place was a lot of fun.  We ordered way to much seafood.  We had the King Crab, Mussels, Shrimp, Veggies, Taters, and Hush Puppies.  It was all great.  We also tried three different sauces on the selection of seafood we ordered.  Plan to get messy.  Our waitress was great, she explained everything to us and all of our options and when we added or altered our order she was totally on top of it. It was a busy Saturday but we were seated right away.  The price can add up especially of you add alcohol to the meal.  Be aware they have specific pricing. Just try it all and get messy.
