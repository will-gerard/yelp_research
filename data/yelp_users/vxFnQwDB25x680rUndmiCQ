My boyfriend and I will be moving in 2 weeks and cannot be more excited. The community and apartments/town homes are exactly what we want and for a great price. Everyone at the leasing office is super nice and very well educated (even when they are newer) about the complex. So far so good!

I hadn't been to a dentist in about 3 years before I finally decided to get over my fears and come in to see Dr. Woodland. The staff was very friendly and worked around my crazy work schedule. I ended up needing a lot of cavity fillings but they made it comfortable and it wasn't  as bad as I thought it was going to be.  I amgetting married in September and they even offered to do some extra work to make my smile "wedding ready." I really feel like this dentist office cares about me and my smile.  I will ALWAYS recommend them to anyone...even my Fiance will be scheduling his appointment soon.

Today was my first time tanning EVER. The girl I spoke to at the front was super friendly and gave me advice on what I should expect and how long of a time I should start with. I'm glad that she wasn't pushy with trying to sell me tanning lotion. The room was clean and it was nice that they offered music to listen to. I'll be going back tomorrow because I got 3 tans for a great deal. I recommend it.

I love this theatre, the only thing is....parking is soooo hard to find. If you plan on seeing a movie for a premiere night, get there early! Otherwise, all the staff is super sweet and its a great movie-going experience.

I've gone here a few times now, they did a good job on the car wash and I enjoy that by buying gas-- I get a free cookie inside the market.

I've been going to the Ulta Salon for over a year now and I love the service I get everytime I'm there. I've had so many bad hair experiences in the past that once I found Ulta and met with Aubry--my hair stylist; I now know I could never leave. Aubry is wonderful and really knows what she is doing! She always does exactly what I want and never cuts off more than I want either! Ive done 3 Kera Straight Treatments with her too and sitting in the chair for hours never bothers me. All the staff is friendly and I always enjoy getting my hair done by them. I give them 5 starts! I am truly impressed and will keep returning! :)

I went here the other day because they have a 1 free wax for first time customers (must be an Arizona resident). The girl that gave me a wax walked me through everything and made me feel really comfortable, even though I was nervous to begin with. She even recomended some products that I ended up buying! I'll be back!

Went here for lunch the other day. The girl at the front was very friendly. I got 1 Slice of Reg Pepeperoni Pizza and it was delicious.  Great spot for a cheap lunch!

NEVER FLYING ALLEGIANT AIRLINES EVER AGAIN. Please note, I am spreading this online to warn others about how unprofessional and terrible Allegiant Airlines treats their customers. I got to the Las Vegas Airport 6/9/13 at 8:30AM in the morning and boarded the plane to phoenix at 10:10AM. Over 200 passengers were eagerly waiting to go up in the air when we continued to wait. We all started noticing that there was no A/C on the plane. The flight crew said that they needed to fix a mechanical problem before we went up in the air. Another HOUR goes by and we are sitting in a plane with NO AIR. People are starting to throw up from the heat exhaustion and even getting nose bleeds. They were not doing anything to cool down the plane or even give us water. They pulled us back to the gate so we could get off after a woman on board started purging from the heat. After then sitting in the terminal for 2 hours, we got no answers as to why we were let to sit in the plane for over 2.5 hours while people were getting so sick. They then boarded us on a different plane at 1:10 and then after about an hour of waiting AGAIN in a plane with NO AC running, the pilot said that they were also having mechanical issues in this new plane. We again waited for them to fix the issue with no water and no AC for another hour. If you can image, it was over 100 degrees on the plane at this point. A lady then FAINTED in the middle of the isle on the plane and when we asked a steward for a paramedic he began saying: "if you want to leave, you can leave." We were yelling at him saying HELLO!! THIS LADY NEEDS MEDICAL HELP!!!!!! After that, people started to get their kids and leave the plane. Even a 2 year old boy was about to faint because he was so hot. We then were told that they fixed the issue about a half hour later and we were up in the air. The pilot said we would be compensated $100 for our trouble and we would be given a free drink of our choice (of course non-alcoholic) when we were at appropriate altitude. The overall professionalism of the allegiant staff was ridiculous. You wouldn't even leave animals in this type of environment, what makes you think its okay to do this to people??? By the time we landed and got our bags it was 5:00 and we then found out that $100 compensation that we were told we would be getting was actually just a voucher for our next flight on Allegiant Airlines. IN WHAT WORLD WOULD ANY OF US EVER FLY ALLEGIANT AGAIN??? How is that "voucher" even useful. I am so sick and STILL dizzy from being kept in a sealed hot plane for over 5 hours, its ridiculous. At what point is it even legal to treat people this way?  I hope you share this with others who travel Allegiant. I will never EVER fly with or support a company that handles situations in the matter in which they did.
