It's a day like any other, or so you think.  During your daily exercise session, a short walk to the mailbox, everything is about to change. You're a goner now. It's a letter from the class reunion committee with your wife's hyphenated maiden name on it, and this can only mean one thing. Saying goodbye to carbs for the next 3 months as she starts serving up swill with hefty amounts of god forsaken vegetables and no carbs.  Yes, she'll try any diet to lose weight, and on her way down, into this veggie-eating, omni-farting hell, take you with her in the process.   It's ok, don't panic. You're a yuppie remember? You live downtown in one of those overpriced lofts, within walking distance from the Arizona Center.   Here's my recommendation.  Walk to Sam's. It's a few more steps than the mailbox, but at least you won't find any unwanted surprises.  Carb loading? You bet.  Order the Desert Fire Pasta, Pancho's Carnitas, or the Chicken Quesadilla.  All noteworthy, especially if you're trying to negate the affects of your wife's cabbage-reunion soup.  Sam's delights. Try it.

Honey Bear.  What a great name. I wish I would have named my first son Honey Bear, or Cornbread J-Cool...something sick like that.  I think that's where going into labor fucks most women up.  They're all like..."Oh yeah baby, I'm down with Luciano or Vincenzo if its a boy... sooo very Italian."  That's in the nine months preceding birth.   Have a little chat with her after she delivers...it's a whole new ball game. Now it's all, "My son isn't going to have a name that sounds like some greaseball mobster, WTF is the matter with you anyway?"  Wow. I don't know how I went down that road. I WAS going to tell you about Honey Bear's but I guess I'm still pissed my first born was named Dan.   Anyway, the food here is pretty tasty. I like it because you can order meat by the pound which is all I ever do. I order eight ounces of barbecued beef, no bun and a glass of water..it's around eight bucks. The service is super fast too, consuming about fifteen minutes of your lunch hour if you wolf your shit like I do.  Their sauce is flavorful too, you'll want to slather a boatload on your beef...kind of sweet and slightly spicy...good tang.   And speaking of good tang, what better way to finish off the remainder of your lunch hour than by going to Band Aid's show lounge...just a block away on 7th and Virginia?  A lunch hour chocked with tang. The fantasy of what heights your son may have aspired to had you gotten your way...naming him Cornbread. And crop-dusting that empty cubicle with some major beef and beer farts around mid afternoon...sending that evil co-worker of yours into a catatonic funk upon her return from the ladies room.  Now that's what I'm talking about.

Don't let the seedy location fool ya, this place is the bomb, serving up some of the most authentic Mexican I've ever tasted.  Your experience will begin with parking in the rear of the place. As you make the long walk to the front entrance, you'll disregard any conversation with others in your party as you worry whether or not your car will be there after dinner. It will and here's why.  As you make your way to the front of the parking lot, you'll notice an old Mexican man, (actually a cliche or sorts, complete with sombrero and serape) sitting, vigilantly keeping an eye on your vehicle and everyone else's.  This should calm you down, enough so that you're able to re-join the conversation. Now get inside and get ready for a cold Mexican beer and a pitcher of Margaritas.   Their chips are gratis and served warm. A nice treat,. They offer red salsa, hot sauce, and tomatillo green sauce which is spectacularly hot.  Every item on their menu is delicious, but my preference is either the Machaca burrito, or the Chicken Mole. Their mole sauce is off the charts good. Not too much chocolate, not too much chile, just right.   What I really love is the black and white photos of old Mexican bandits, governors, rabble rousers, war hero, ex-Presidents and others.   Here's my suggestion. Go on a weeknight when they're not busy. In this way, you can make your way around the room and get a close up look at the images, which in my opinion are worth a look,.  The food, ambiance, service are all superb.  This is the place where I take out-of towner's when they say they want 'real' Mexican food.  This is also the place where your butt-hole will curse you the next day if you don't listen to him and ease up on the salsa.

What a charm San Carlos. Unpretentious - as though sitting in a restaurant somewhere deep in Mexico - this place has all the charm of, well, a shitty little restaurant deep in Mexico. But that's not why I love San Carlos. I eat here because of their inexpensive yet delicious food offerings.  Let me put it another way, I recently dined at Ocean Club, ordering their seafood tower as an appetizer. It was in the three-hundred dollar range...for an appetizer. YIKES. At San Carlos you can get the same seafood platter, featuring every denizen of the deep for under thirty dollars!  Clams, mussels, crab; both king and stone claws, snapper, cod, octopus, tilapia, and a host of other fish whose names escape me all served on an oval platter stacked four inches high. Two of us couldn't finish it.  As I said, if you're looking for charm, forget it.  Also, make sure you have a good car alarm as it's in a dodgy part of Phoenix.  But it is Arizona, so no-one will be surprised if you dine with a heater on your hip.  It also helps if you know a bit more Spanish other than; My name is Diego, would you let me sleep with me for twenty dollars?

As if the Sonoran Desert wasn't weird enough with all its threatening vegetation, well, it just got a whole lot weirder.  There's blown glass littered throughout the garden's exhibits, each of the works mimicking a type of cactus. Strange but beautiful. Also featured is live music; Apache storytellers, poets, and some guy who figured out how to make music out of a bunch of clay pots.   Beverage stations are also littered throughout the garden, making the whole event somewhat tolerable, given how it was more important for my wife to blow-off the ASU/ UofA game, instead taking our lingering Thanksgiving guests to some kind of bullshit ooh and ahh fest littered with cactus.  Once I was there, I got into to it, but I did have to be coerced.  Glad I did.  Here's a pic.

Looking for good BBQ?  Got a hankering for some tasty meats, slow roasted to perfection? Hop a flight to Austin Texas and head straight for 'The County Line' BBQ.   If you can't do that, the next best thing in Phoenix is Honey Bears. A long time establishment dedicated to satiating the appetites of carnivores everywhere.  Their motto is quaint and to the point;  "You don't need no teeths to eat our meat." Isn't that just precious? And so it goes, their motto has managed to attract the dentifrice-challenged from all over the valley, their smiles resembling jack-'o-lanterns.  Well I have all my 'teeths', which is precisely why I come here.  Being older, looks beginning to wane, I still have a nice set of choppers which excludes me from the dentifrice challenged category. It also makes me revered by other diners my age as a demi-god of sorts.    So whenever i'm feeling down, a little blue over how I never get the once-over from hot babes anymore, I come here,  where I'm worshipped by  toothless fucks from all over Phoenix, and all for little more than a lifetime of dental care! Go figure.  Their brisket. pork shoulder and chicken, all tasty, better than most BBQ joints in Phoenix.  Beans and coleslaw, nothing spectacular.  Service, friendly. Truly a good BBQ joint. Sauce is decent.  It's like eating at a homeless shelter, except the bbq is really good, and some half-assed preacher isn't in the dining area requiring you say a bunch of prayers in order to get a free meal.

The menu reads like a novel with its many offerings. Too many in fact. So I did what every other non-asian does - order fried rice and some kind of chow mein. What a waste.  All the nearby diners had ordered dishes resembling images from pages of Bon Appetit, so I sat there eating my rice and watching them eat some really cool looking stuff.  After you eat, visit the Ranch Market next door.  They sell live frogs.  Hang out long enough and you'll get to watch as the butcher takes you back to 7th grade biology where the only thing missing is Lauren Shockey screaming in your face when you commence to chopping away at his shit.  Anyway, it's a good field trip.  Szechwan and Ranch Market. In that order.

Conversation in VIP room;  Her: I can't go out with you after work - I only have the sitter til 2.  Me: Aw, baby, c'mon, call the sitter, tell her you'll pay her overtime.  Her: Can't. Maybe we can go out next Tuesday. I get off early.  Me: You always say that but Tuesday will come around and you'll have some new excuse why you can't go out with me.   Her: (being witty)  Nuh-uh.   Me: Yeah, huh. (witty response)  Her: I'll tell you what, I'll go out with you if you pay for the sitter, pay me what I lose out in tips that night, and take me to a nice place - like Outback.   I pause to do some mental math.  Her: Do we have a deal?  Me: What say I just give you fifty bucks and you beej me in the parking lot after work.  Her: Fuck you, you pig.   Me: Whaat?? What did I say? - Wait - come back - I'll throw in a few extra singles for formula.

Let's say you're going to an important event such as a black-tie affair.  This is your big chance to impress the boss, showing him how you really are executive material - deserving of that Senior VP spot he's been holding open since Smithers moved back to Ohio.   But you're not going to do this alone. You need your wife in tow and she's a far cry from the polished, senior manager's wife 'look' after having that fifth child recently  What do you do? Simple. Sign her up for a day of pampering at the Red Door Spa where they'll turn your lactating little housefrau into Cinderella and in only a day! Go figure.   I recommend the Signature Escape package.  You're probably going to want to toss in a massage, body tan, facial and make-up too. It's going to cost you a bundle, but it beats the alternative when she shows up with her long unkempt toenails, trying to pull them off as a French pedicure.   Or her generous application of  sky-blue eye makeup, making her look like a rodeo clown.   And that old gown - two sizes two small - squeezing her tits into oblivion while showcasing her proliferate back-meat sausaging from the back side.  Just do this man. Shell out the five hundred or so bucks to make her feel like a woman again, and not the sweat-wearing, baby-vomit smelling inmate she's become.   Not only will she thank you, your boss just may sign you up for that corner office after he sees your little hottie - secretly hoping to get a piece of that someday after he fires you.   Do this for her at least once in your married life together. You'll be glad you did.

Flawless service and reasonably priced gourmet cuisine are the hallmark of this fine establishment. I love it here. My Delmonico was absolute perfection, as was the bernaise sauce along with the sides.  My date had the lobster and crab stuffed shrimp, which if you think about it, is the oceanic equivalent of turducken.  Not that I'd ever eat turducken, but her ordering this dish caused me to rethink my entire value system. Maybe turducken is in my short-term future, who knows.   Which causes me to wonder why it's ok to stuff a tiny little shrimp with a bevy of other larger crustaceans in the first place. The turkey I get. It's a big motherfucker, capable of stuffing practically any other fowl inside of it. But a shrimp? If anything, they should stuff it with smaller crustaceans, like krill or something.  Anyways, I forgot what I was talking about. Oh yeah, Capital Grille. There are a lot of older people in here. One old woman in the booth next to ours was coughing up shit all through dinner which really sucked. I turned and gave her the skunk-eye, as if to say; 'Hey bitch, take your phlegmmy-ass outside and let me enjoy my meal', but she shot me a look right back, saying; 'Hey you little wad, I've got more money than anyone in this place and if I so choose, I'll dredge up as much phlegm as I want...now piss off and stop staring at me.'  All things considered, our meal was really good except for Sputum Queen in the next booth. I hope she gets pneumonia if she doesn't already. Bitch.

I've been in many presidential suites, few better than the one here. Everything is superb. Attention to detail, focused and sharp. And the room itself? Romantic with it's outdoor showers, making you feel almost naughty when showering. And room service? I enjoyed the eggs benedict, although it was somewhat cold.  Too bad I onlly have until till two o'clock to get this room cleaned and ready for shift manager inspection.

One of the benefits of being a native Arizonan is knowing all the best kept secrets our state has to offer. That doesn't mean I'll share them with you, because I won't.   However, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, mainly about how I do little or nothing for my fellow man and how the karma from that might bite me in the ass someday. So i'm going to share one secret with you about a Phoenix restaurant this one time.  LGO. The food is superb, the service is quick, the ambiance, fantastic. That's not the secret.  The secret is MJ's breads.  MJ Coe is an award winning baker whose breads are the best in all of Phoenix. All us natives know this, and now you do too.  LGO not only uses his breads in their  sandwiches, they offer them by the loaf.  And here's the secret that hopefully keeps me out of the karma-cancer hot seat.   MJ offers a signature chocolate-cherry french bread that's quite simply the best bread on earth. The color of chocolate, dark brown, it looks like no loaf of french bread you've ever seen, almost like a pumpernickel. Outside, the crust is perfect. Inside, the crumb is moist and chewy, with large chunks of what I can only presume is world class chocolate along with whole fresh cherries.   And as if the chocolate french bread wasn't enough, biting into a chunk of chocolate or a cherry in every bite is the experience of a lifetime, one you won't soon forget. But plan ahead. LGO doesn't shelf this bread, it's a special order requiring a one day notice.   Here's another tip, mainly for men.  Order at least two loaves.  One for the drive home, as you incessantly pick at it until its DOA. The other to present to your wife in a blatant attempt to barter something other than jewelry for a blow-job.

Come here on a Sunday when you're hungover. Pick a table in the center of the dining room, and stare out the window wondering why, between Mastro's last night and El Santo all day Saturday you spent, oh wait, and the Candy Store was in there someplace, over 700 bucks this weekend.  This place is pretty eclectic with its high energy young crowd adorned in yoga pants, and, its older hipsters, also wearing yoga pants.It would appear this place is some kind of Mecca for yoga pants aficionados. The music is cool too. A friend recently spent the day here working, Shazam'ing the entire time, saying; "You can find the same music on Pandora's 'Lumineers' station."  Anyway, I ate a chopped turkey salad, or at least a part of it while pensively gazing out the windows, as If trying to come up with a cure for cancer or something.  The salad and a soda was ten bucks.  This is a great move, staring out of windows. Others will think you're an eccentric genius or something as you stare directly through them, mindlessly revisiting your bonehead moves from the weekend, chuckling to yourself every now and again as you think about  that stripper showing off her false teeth for a dollar. Who does that?   As I said, this is a great place to feel good about yourself when you get a load of the granny hipsters in their unfulfilled (pancake butt) yoga pants that oddly enough, manage to telegraph the outline of an equally loose fitting thong.  Eeew, and double eeew. (Eeew)   I yakked up the salad afterwards, but it had nothing to do with the food or the ill-fated thongs. I think it was the egg and my hellacious hangover. The thong visual was pretty messed up though.

Friday night in Arcadia and plenty to do.  The Little Woody across the street for pre-gaming. A craft beer bar next door to La Fontanella with a patio overlooking Camelback at sunset.  And finally, La Fontanella.  Appetizers.  The prosciutto and melon paired with Ruffino Ducale should have been illegal. A nice antipasto and some escargot, followed by a ten-inch canoli that had me rethinking my sexuality. And a waiter who made me feel like I was home at mamas once again, prompting a Sunday visit to the graveyard. (eeew, I know)  I don't remember much except it was all older people, no kids, and the bill was one and a half Franklins. The snails were heavenly despite my contempt for them, this after spending Saturdays at grandma's house, ridding her garden of the little fuckers after grandpa died.  Slimy fucks, but they were good with the garlic, pesto, and fontina crust.  Being drunk helped too.  Nice experience.

I went to a strip club in Mexico once and had a memorable experience. One that I've tried to replicate for many years after.  The stripper, who was very cute and also very proud of her lactating skills, would for all of a buck hastily whip out one of her tits on demand, squeeze it, and shoot a stream of milk at you.  She reminded me of drunk me, peeing in a parking lot someplace...waving my stream around until I've spelled out my name.    People...now that's entertainment!  As compared with the Candy Store, where some dumb-as-a-bag-of-hammers stripper who's all too willing to spend a few thousand bucks on breast implants while badly in need of dental implants, snubs you because the black-light illumination is prominently displaying  the pee stain on your cargo shorts.   The Candy Store. Nice boobs. Bad grilles. And girls with no fundamental lactating / squirting abilities, which they should possess since most are single moms.   A disappointment on every level.

Did you wake up naked in the driveway again this morning? I know...happens to me a lot too.  Your wife warned you about this,  and now she's talking divorce. What do you do?  The only logical thing you can do at this point, that is if you want to save your marriage....tell her you're signing up for Alcoholics Anonymous. Only you don't actually sign up for AA, you just tell her that.  What you do instead is sign up for the Tuesday night men's bowling league at AMF. I know, perfect...right? Same night as the AA meetings. And, the same duration, 35 weeks.   Just remember to take off your "Marauders" bowling team shirt afterward, eat a bag of popcorn to cover the beer breath, and don't get duped into answering any questions  calling for a three or more syllable word in the response when she asks about the meeting.  It's those pesky word slurs that'll get you nailed. Well, that and waking up naked in the driveway.   One more thing. You'll need to memorize that whole twelve step thing, randomly blurting them out over the next 9 months. She'll get sick of hearing about them, and stop asking so many damned questions. This will really throw her off the trail.   You're on the road to recovery my friend...a changed man, and all thanks to AMF!

When I was a kid, my dad used to fry bologna for dinner.  I hated it.  It was so greasy, it left a film in my mouth...as if my tongue was coated with some sort of lard. Well if you like this sort of thing, I highly recommend going to Church's.   I ate there last week. Afterward, one of the women in my office asked if I lost a bet. When I pressed, asking why she'd say something like that,  she responded;   "I noticed you had lip gloss on."

Bad news for any regulars here. Silvertouch is no longer.  They've sold and are operating under Arizona Car Wash. Bobby is also no longer there.   Props to the Weiss brothers and Bobby for many years of cleaning my rides, and the great personal touch.   As for the new company?  Rude order taker. Bad vacuum. Half-assed cleaned. Inside not cleaned.  I wouldn't give these guys the air out of my ass to cool their soup, let alone another dollar.  Time to find a new car wash.

Pizza is good, other dishes so so, but the real reason you should eat here is their white pizza with chicken and garlic. I was skeptical at first, being a pepperoni aficionado, but the white pizza made a believer out of me. Here's my suggestion. Head into the bar and knock back a pitcher. Then order your white pizza, asking for anchovies in addition to the chicken and garlic. But only ask for a few.  Nobody likes anchovies, not even your weirdest friend.   Next, when the pizza arrives, being the gentleman you are, you offer up a slice to your friends. One by one they refuse, making sure to squinch-up their nose while doing so....a telltale sign of their disgust for anchovies. Perfect. Now, carefully pick off all of the anchovies and eat the entire thing by yourself, and, what you can't finish in this sitting you can have for breakfast.  Let this serve as a good life lesson. Always remember, if you don't want to share your delicious meal with anyone, you have two choices: 1.) Spit on it.  2.) Add anchovies.   Spitting is kind of uncool, especially in a public restaurant and all. This is why I'd run with the anchovy concept.

I'll bet you didn't know commercially farmed turkeys are incapable of reproduction. Did you. It's true.  Turkeys can't breed anymore.  So how is it there are so many turkeys? This is so weird.   Turkey farmers actually employ people to masturbate the Tom's, so they can artificially inseminate the hens.  This is so creepy, it makes me never want to eat turkey again. Especially when you consider how turkeys ALSO eat their own shit.   However.... I have a cholesterol problem, and  have now found myself in the unenviable position of being on red-meat lockdown.  Shit.   Shit indeed my friend.  Turkey it shall be.  And no-one makes turkey burgers like these guys. Order one Kilauea style.  You'll be pleasantly surprised at how delicious it is, despite your now knowing that what you're eating is the fruit of someone's labor... whose job it was to sit around jacking turkeys all day long.  The thought of eating turkey repulses me. But I temper my repulse with the realization that the more turkey I consume, the more turkey-jacker-jobs I've just helped to create.  And that makes me happy.  Important note: Our server informed us he was knocking two bucks off the bill. When I asked why, he offered no reason, saying " We just wanted to discount your meal today." I think he overheard me talking about Yelp every time he wandered close by.

In a last ditch attempt at exhibiting what may be the last shred of virility within my being, I took one of my vintage Robert Graham shirts to Brothers. I did so after my wife plucked it from the Goodwill pile, reasoning how these folks can fix anything, and how I shouldn't give away such an expensive party shirt.  I agreed.  And now I have a vintage Robert Graham shirt hanging in my closet.  Just hanging there. Waiting...for the day when my wife says something like;          "Hey, wanna go clubbing tonight?"  I have a feeling it may have to go back to Brothers a few more times in its hanging career...while my weight changes... like I'm a finalist in the Duncan Yo-Yo tournament.

If you're a pot-smoker, then you can relate to this. Even if you don't smoke pot you'll still relate.  You're hungry.  No, you're starving.  A sudden onset of the munchies so pronounced, you're willing to eat almost anything. You pour through the fridge searching for anything, but all you can find are some leftovers from weeks ago, whose vintage looks now resemble a science experiment.  You know you'll hate yourself later, but God help you...you've got to eat something. Anything.  In your shark-like eating frenzy, you microwave the orange colored shit, setting the timer for double the time you normally would, reasoning how the extreme heat should kill off any new strains of life-threatening diseases. You go to sleep afterward, and later awaken to the feeling you've just done something horribly wrong.   If you've ever experienced that feeling. That cathartic moment when you ask yourself; "why did I just do that?" You'll experience it at least one more time if you eat here.  There's another reason I don't like this place. The server, upon noticing how my plate resembled a chicken-bone graveyard of sorts, unceremoniously and very swiftly demanded I eat 'moh vegtubul'.  I don't care for places where the server scolds me like my mother used to.  If I want to dredge up those memories, I'll go to a shrink, not Lims.

I never actually went into the restaurant.  My friend, who's been telling me about Carolina's for years, brought over some take-out the other day.  Prefacing our wolfing session, he informed me the meal might not be the greatest, but how the tortillas were the absolute bomb. He said they were the best in the valley, and how when he was in line to pickup the order, several people were there for only tortillas.  Everything he said was accurate. My red chile was ok, nothing special. Refried beans, above average.  The tortillas?  Unbelievable. Growing up in south Phoenix, and having a plethora of Hispanic friends whose mom's all made homemade tortillas, Carolina's took me back to those happy days when mom sent me out into the hood looking for my father every weekend.  I almost always found him at the Granillo residence, slurping menudo, drinking beer and eating Mrs Granillo's tortillas, which were the best in the hood. Carolinas reminded me of Mrs Granillo, my dad, and my mother yelling at him for coming home drunk. That is until he whipped out some of Mrs Granillo's tortillas, then she lost her mind and all was forgiven.  If you go to Carolinas, order a dozen flour tortillas, and eat one or two. Then go out clubbing and get sloppy drunk. When your wife presses for where you've been all night, whip out the tortillas. They'll save your bacon. I know this first-hand.

Dear New Times,  I don't quite understand why the reviewers here are so down on you but can only conjecture how most aren't strip club aficionados, in need of a good car stereo at low, low, prices, and, have little interest in attending concert events featuring eighties bands who've been on 'Behind the Music-where are they now'.  But that's precisely why I love you.  WIthout you, how would I have ever known Chesty Morgan was performing a one-night only  gig at Bourbon Street? I've never seen 96FFFF tits prior to or since that day, so kudos for that one. The image of her hot air balloon tits will be forever seared into my temporal lobes, and one that I frequently whip-out, right along with my hoo-dilly when I need to...well, you know.  A triumphant five stars for that piece of it.  As for the car stereo places featuring the 'One dollar install', what a load of shit those places are. They may only charge a buck to install it, but you can get the same piece of equipment on Crutchfield Online for half the money, and, get a high school dropout to install it for a couple of blunts.  So no stars for those thieving fucks.  And your classifieds? I love them. Particularly the variety. Men seeking women. Women seeking men. Bi-men seeking racially bigoted trans-gendered she-male dominatrix. Women seeking goats. Is there no end to your ever-growing list of classified captions?  Five more stars, but mainly for your consideration of the deviant sex aficionado whose only outlet prior to your varietal classifieds was either NAMBLA, or a henhouse.  Another section of your paper I love is the call girl ads.  Yet five more stars and big fat mega props to your devoting page after page to these industrious eager beavers. I can't begin to tell you how consoling it is to know that when it's my turn to host poker night, I can choose from any number of 'college coeds' to make certain my soiree is the hit of the season. Although, I can't give you a bunch of stars on this one. Not only did one of my buddies lose a stack that night at poker, he also lost his longtime girlfriend, and, with no medical insurance, his low-rent romance cost him a couple of trips to the clinic.  You may want to look into this.  Maybe put one of your reporters on the case, since it tends to irretrievably fuck-up people's lives when someone shows up to the party with chlamydia. Major party foul.  Anyway, overall, I have to give you high marks.  Between Chesty's gigantor titties, 'mostly' disease-free call girls, and, seeing at least two of the original Eagles perform at some Indian Casino way the hell out in BFE, my life has only been greatly enhanced by what most here caption as an 'uninformative rag.' I find you anything but.  PS. If you need someone to write a comedy food review column, I think I'm your boy.  If not, then I suggest having one of your reporters go undercover, hoping they meet up with 'Destiny'. One of your call 'girl' ad customers who conveniently forgot to mention how she was in possession of one very large dick.  That was another 'big' party foul.

When was the last time you and your friends had a clambake?  Been a while?  Not anymore. Gather up your crew and head for Deck 9 at Terminal 4, Sky Harbor parking garage.  Security rarely comes up here, and once wick'd from all the weed, you'll get to watch planes take off and land. A righteous evening my man.   Now load that bong, crank that old Rammstein CD, and smoke up your mom's Lexus like it's in a Kansas City Smokehouse.  Enjoy.  And if the po-po show up, you're probably high enough that you can jump down to level 8 and hot-foot it over to the elevator.  Sky Harbor International Airport Terminal 4 Parking garage. Deck 9. Rocks balls.

Its Saturday and you promised you'd fix the downstairs toilet today, especially since your wife's friends are coming over for dinner tonight.  One small problem. You don't know shit from apple butter about fixing a toilet.  What do you do?  Simple. Log on to the internet to the popular site EHOW, asking how to bet a quinella, exacta, trifecta, and superfecta. Once you know how to properly bet, next go to Equibase and download the TIP of the Day for Turf Paradise. Now you're ready to fix that toilet.  Begin by explaining how you need parts and have to run all over town to get them.   Now you're free to sneak over to Turf Paradise for the afternoon. Fuck the toilet. A few beers. A few bets.  A few yuks. Your troubles are over dude.  Until tonight, when after dinner you deuce big in the downstairs bathroom, forgetting how you never fixed the stupid toilet. Uh-oh.  You should have never listened to me.  You should know by now I'm an idiot.  Next time...when you're on EHOW, try the search term 'how to fix a toilet', or maybe even 'how to make my wife stop nagging me to fix a toilet'. Either will work.

Sunday, and the family wants to go on a picnic. Great. You have a couple of choices.  Feign some sort of non-specific illness so you can sit home and watch Red Zone Channel, or tag along and act like a good parent for a change. You choose the latter.  This was the drill.  I called in a takeout order at Poncho's, picked it up, then drove the entire crew up to Dobbin's Lookout atop South Mountain. (About a 10 minute drive from Poncho's on Central Avenue)  Yup. A seven-mile vertical drive up South Mountain chocked with enough mountain switchbacks to ensure your entire family will be car sick upon arrival, leaving most, if not all of Poncho's feast available for your lunch tomorrow.  Hey, I didn't do this on purpose, things just worked-out in my favor for a change.

Four stars for the food, another cumulative star for the service, making them a solid five. That was before we checked out.  Minus five for their not having a defibrillator onsite as my heart began missing beats after their informing me how two cups of soup, a half sandwich, a whole sandwich, two iced teas, a cookie and a small slice of bread pudding came to forty-seven bucks.  I must have appeared to the cashier as a mouth-breather and to everyone else in line when I stood there, frozen,vegetatively mumbling;  "Huh - forty-seven bucks - really - how is that even possible?"  But it was my turn to pay for lunch, so I couldn't tell them to stuff their forty-seven bucks and walk out due to their location being directly in the middle of BFE, and with nowhere else to eat except desert vegetation, I sucked it up.  Grumpily, I sat there eating lunch, fixating on how I'd just blasted through one fifth of my unemployment check on a half turkey sandwich and a cup of soup the size of a thimble.   Not going back.

If you're looking for a cold beer and appetizers this is the place. Plenty of ambiance in this old west facsimile, but stop there. Ok, maybe impress your  out of town friends with the rattlesnake, but dont go any further. Our meal was atrocious! The "family" style salad provided us each a generous single leaf of lettuce and an entire cherry tomatoe...no refills! The bread basket boasted of Indian fry bread on the menu, this however looked more like a turd of some sort, and tasteless to boot, (sorry about the pun). When I ordered up my bone in ribeye, I asked for it Pittsburgh style, the server had never heard the term. (And she wasnt new in the job) I had visions of a thick cut (it did say 20 oz.) of well done prime rib steak.  What I got was a tepid piece of meat that was at least 8 inches in diameter and only about 3/4 inch thick, full of fat and, due to it being served almost lukewarm, the fat was beginning to solidify. In their defense, the green beans were tasty, but I had to wait for our party of 7 to finish eating before making my rounds, inquiring, "Are you going to eat your beans?" Yes, I managed to make a meal out of the green beans, since that was the only good thing on the menu. When we left, I noticed 3 tour buses in the parking lot with what appeared to be out-of-towners lining up at the entrance.  I can only deduce that this place is still in business because of its promise of old-west lore and the charm that goes with the scenery and view. I will never repeat this horrid experience. Oh, I did give it one star due to our extremely pleasant young server who was all too anxious to please...but God help her, even she couldnt fix this mess!

It's date night and you're headed to the movies. Now the dilemma. Eat a small mountain of hot, faux-buttered popcorn at the movies, or a little popcorn and a  decent meal afterward. I go with both. Only I'm usually too full to eat anything of decent substance after all that popcorn so I typically come here. Tea Lite Cafe.  It's cheap and filling and, its under ten bucks. I've tried both the chicken based pho and the beef, go with the beef...it has a ton more flavor. Another bonus is how the meat in the soup is all very recognizable, putting that whole dog and cat meat thing to rest.  A large bowl will feed two. I weasel most of the meat out of it when my date goes to the bathroom.  And she wonders why I fart so much.

Torture, as defined by Webster is the act of deliberately inflicting pain, which is exactly what I did Saturday. With #19 molar in need of an immediate extraction, I came here anyway, throbbing tooth and all. Big mistake.   The pre-meal tortilla chips were difficult to resist, igniting nothing short of a masochistic dining event.  The menudo was white and bland as hell, but the tripe was perfectly cooked.  My wife's flauta's were crunchy enough to send me through the rafters with each torturous, but delicious bite.   The only thing I could wolf handily was her refried beans and some handmade flour tortillas which were too, too good.   I looked like Senator McCain after eating here, but it was worth it.

The term, "You get what you pay for" has never been more apropos than at Massage Envy. The unfriendly check-in. The wait time that was auto-deducted from my hour, turning an hour massage into a 43 minute massage. And the shakedown for the gratuity at the end, all combined to make this experience one I  WILL NOT repeat.  I've been to two locations of M.E. both equally bad. During the massage, the therapist was hawking a 12 month membership plan which I thought was tacky. Try to relax while someone is attempting to sell you a membership...the two are mutually exclusive.  My overall conclusion about M.E. is that it's a massage sweatshop for the masses, and will likely appeal to those who have never had a good massage and have no expectations.  As a veteran massage aficionado however, I know the difference between a relaxing, therapeutic experience and what this place is selling. The best analogy I can give is the difference between fine dining and fast food. If this place is fast food, its not even up to Taco Bell standards.

She never comes on to you anymore, not since having that last kid.  But tonight is different. You sense a playful mood. Her overtures are clear, she's in the mood and wants romance tonight.   [her]   "The sitter's on the way,"   [me]   "How's Houston's sound boo?"   [her] "Oh my god, I soooo love Houston's, thank-you, thank-you, thank-you baby."  Houstons has the best hot-fudge sundaes anywhere, using only the finest imported Belgian chocolate, real whipped cream, and deliciously smooth, velvety ice-cream. It's the bomb. I need to stop. I can't go on describing it...not without getting aroused in a strange way.   One problem.  What she wants after dinner is the last thing on your mind, not with this herpes flareup anyway.  And that's why you want to come to Houston's during your next outbreak.    Chocolate, according to scientific research, affects the pleasure center of ones brain much in the same way as sex, hopefully tricking her into feeling fulfilled without going anywhere near your diseased baloney pony.   [me]   "Excuse me, waitress....could you bring us another?"    Annnnd, we'rre out.  Now, thank Houston's for saving your rotten hide as all that chocolate takes hold on her brain. Oh, and go get some Valtrex on that thing before her next overture.   I think I should be a life coach or something. I'd even follow this advice.

If you come here to eat breakfast because an old friend is in town for the day, here's some advice; DON'T. Service doesn't even aspire toward bad. In fact, the service ranks so far down on the bad scale, it can't be measured. I't like that movie...The Abyss. Food was decent, but nothing to make your shorts wet.  And you know those dollar sign symbols indicating how pricey the joint?  Well this place should have a small picture of Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg gathered inside  the bullion room at Fort Knox for some kind of ceremonial "Were rich, bitches'  circle jerk, prominently displayed somewhere on the menu.  This place not only sucks balls, it does so with such tremendous wind tunnel force, it swooshes them down whole, where they lodge in the back of your throat, jamming up your glottal stop, preventing you from making the UH-OH sound upon seeing your bill.

I'm not sure how to write this review without telling a story. I normally don't write dissertations, favoring the short and sweet condensed review, so if it's a little verbose, bear with me as it's a story worth reading.  We've heard about Casella's for years but have never eaten there, usually due to bad timing on our part as they close early on Saturday and are not open for business on Sundays.  We finally made it there today during normal business hours.  Not knowing what to expect, we decided prior to going in if we weren't impressed with the menu, or the joint itself, we'd give each other the signal and find another lunch place. Well we weren't impressed with the decor, the menu or the overall ambiance, so we gave each other the nod and started for the door.  That's when the owner, Joe Casella stopped us. Recognizing us as newbies, he told us all about his restaurant,  the menu, and even offered us a taste of whatever we liked. We declined, perhaps being a bit skeptical. But then something interesting happened.  Joe introduced us to his wife and two of his four daughters (who were on duty) and we were instantly enamored with this family.  Who does that in 2011? Seriously. He asked our names and even shook my hand.  Long story short, after talking with Joe for just a few short minutes, my wife and I gave each other a reverse nod, signaling our eagerness to try something...anything!  We ordered a couple sandwiches on Joe's recommendation. The food was superb. The bread was one of the best rolls I've ever had and is enough reason by itself  to keep us coming back. Crusty and not overly breaded, it reminded me of the rolls in Atlantic City where the bread is pure perfection.  Same for the sandwich ingredients, full of flavor and cooked just right.  But the best part was how Joe came over to talk to us after finishing our meal. He wanted our candid opinion of the food and service. If there's any single reason for me to frequent this place, it's the genuine heartfelt sincerity of the owner and his family, not to mention the food!  Sure, the decor is old and needs updating, but somehow, after meeting the family, and eating lunch, I didn't care about the decor, or the no-nonsense menu, or the layout. None of that mattered anymore.  What mattered was the overall experience of a true family restaurant, their wholesome foods, and being in the company of genuinely warm people.   In a time when most of us tend to rely on first impressions, judging the proverbial book by its cover almost caused us to miss out on the Casella's experience had it not been for Joe Casella taking our hand and welcoming us into his unique domain.  Casella's took me back in time today, when my grandparents would often take me with them to the Italian deli for lunch.  As they visited with the owner (in Italian), sipped espresso for what seemed like hours, and ate a slow lunch, I wanted to die. I remember sitting there in the booth fidgeting as they talked, hoping like hell we'd get out of there soon. I hated that experience as a kid. I loved it today as an adult, but more importantly, finally recognized and appreciated the gift my grandparents unknowingly gave me.  Thank-You Joe

It's Wednesday and that means one thing...poker night with the guys. But the last few weeks at this have been torturous, as you go home penniless, drunk, and now having to face your wife. And the worst part is how you'll probably lose again tonight.  Well not tonight, Here's the plan. Stop off at the Cheesecake Factory before the game.  Order the four-cheese pasta, it's simply delightful. Have a couple beers to wash it down.  Now, sit back and let the magic happen.  Of course you're going to lose at poker again tonight, but at least someone else is going to get tortured as your room-clearing farts decimate the place.  Revenge is sweet, and Cheesecake can help you serve up a big steaming bowl.

This place is for people whose palate has yet to evolve beyond Spaghetti-Ohs. Deli products are overpriced. And the sandwiches are as disappointing as my effort in the bedroom.  Not really.  Yeah...really. [sigh]

Most people with Italian blood lines, and who call themselves Italians, are merely people who happen to like spaghetti and meatballs or pizza.  Kind of like a six-year old. And me. I'm straight-up American on most days, until I go into an Italian deli...where there are other Italians. That's when I switch on my ancestry and lose my fucking mind. Asking for mooooozadellla instead of mozzarella.  Or pahm-oodg-onnna rather than parmesan.  I know, I'm an asshole. But really no more of an asshole than Oprah interviewing Chris Rock.   It's weird, I know, but that's what people do. They get around their own ethnicity and turn on the shit.  So I guess I shouldn't be surprised (but I always am) each time the counter person at Guido's appears confused, much like a dog not understanding a command as his head goes sideways and he says..."huh, you want what?"   Guido,  You really should have someone of Italian descent working the counter.  Someone who can capish Italian-American-douchebaggery.  Your salad and greek olives, margherita pepperoni, Aurechio provolone, prosciutto, and crusty bread have wowed me for years. And, when I'm too lazy to make my own dough, for two bucks, you always save my hide after promising the kids I'd make pizza.  No offense, but I will never come in for pizza or spaghetti, mainly because I can't put any kind of Italian dialect on the words pizza or spaghetti.  Unless I talk like I'm from New York.            "Heya....yo....gimme a dish 'o post-r  and a couple o yoo hoos."  But I'm afraid the guy with his head cocked sideways will spit in my food or something.  Get someone Italian working the counter and I'll give you that extra star.  Your ardent admirer,  Diego

There are a lot of places in Phoenix Metro where you can get a good Italian sub, but only a handful where you can score a great Italian sub. Guido's is one of them.  Their subs, hot or cold, are some of the best in the area. I say this tongue in cheek, mainly because if you're from New York or Philly you'll disagree with my 'great' assessment. But do try to keep in mind this is the desert.  Where we don't have decent breads unless the deli is buying local from MJ or Arizona Bread Company, which they typically don't. The cold cuts are Boar's heads and not imported.  And the tomatoes are desert tomatoes, not Jersey sweets.  So there IS a difference, you're right NY and Philly, but once you get off your high horse and figure out there aren't a whole lot of places to choose from here, you'll eat Guido's and you'll like it goddammit. Ughhh.    I visit here regularly to restock my fridge with fresh olives, imported provolone, and Margherita pepperoni, one of the few places that has it. They also have decent homemade biscotti and pizzelles. Their homemade sausage is tasty too. Not the best, just tasty.  If you often find yourself eating at any of the chain sub shops around town, give yourself a break from the insufferable shit they call 'Italian' and try Guido's.   Guido's. Where in light of everything, easier (and cheaper) than a trip to New York, Philly, or Atlantic City.

One of the last bastions of manhood, Mortons. The cigar friendly bar. The ornate mahogany surroundings, reminding me of my attorney and how much money he makes. And the presentation.   If you've never been to Morton's, you'll marvel at their menu presentation.  A serving cart, wheeled to your table and on it, what appears to be the finest cuts of beef ever along with one cute surprise: a live lobster. And beleive me, you'll know he's alive when despite his rubber-banded claws, he precariously ooches his way off his dinner plate and heads your direction,  You won't hear a fucking word the server is saying as you fixate on this three pound crustacean who looks like he's hell-bent on sampling  your crudites, so it's best to bring a date along, one whose retention skills aren't limited to a two or three hour window, so you can ask her to repeat whatever it was the server just told you.   And just in case your date is as dumb-as-a-fence-post, the server will give you a menu card the size of those index cards that helped you to fail your pre-meds.   On it, you'll notice things like Mortons chopped salad, which I highly recommend. Broccoli, which if your'e into that whole cruciferous-cancer-crusade, is darned tasty when schmeared with their delicious hollandaise sauce.  And the desserts.  I think they float down from Heaven on a little white pillow.  Just like the little white pillow your wedding ring was delivered on, but have since  lost  and replaced with a fifty dollar replica.

Once, a cozy restaurant with its intimate atmosphere, well, that Morton's no longer exists. The Morton's we visited last night looks more like the interior of a jumbo jet.  With its many, newly added tables, it reminded me of walking onto a 747 and peering down the aisle at the countless number of seats.   The wall separating the bar from the main dining room, like Elvis, has left the building. This along with the pony wall in the center of the room - the one with all the magnum sized bottles of wine sitting atop its shelf. These dividers were important to me, at least architecturally speaking anyway.  They created a sense of space and separation, making for a more intimate dining and drinking experience.   Also gone is the server's presentation of menu items.  Yes, the buffet cart with the many cuts of beef and the live lobster trying to make a break for it is no longer. But then it makes sense.  When you squeeze that many tables into a small room, there's no room to navigate the cart between tables.  In fact, I couldn't even squeeze my big ass in between the tables without feeling like I was going to knock someone's fork right into their eye socket!  I guess I'm just getting old, not wanting to sit within earshot of neighboring tables, listening in to insanely stupid conversations, or smell their lobster dinner continually wafting in my direction - or the old woman next to me whose parfum smelled like RAID, ant and roach killer.  Food and service are the same; excellent in a word.  I probably won't be returning anytime soon. I need a more intimate atmosphere - one that allows me to rip on other diners without their hearing me do so.  The guy next to us looked like a barn owl, and I couldn't say anything until leaving, but by then, it was too late. My wife never saw him.  We could have gotten a really good laugh out that weird looking unit had we been sitting in one of the old booths in the center of the room.  Yes, I always make fun of people uglier than me.  Deal with it.

Pedicures - vital to a woman's very existence, but to a man, as in the straight male, a concept as foreign as the exchange student in the movie Sixteen Candles; Long Duck Dong.  In fact there's no conceivable reason for a straight male to ever come here - or so I thought.  That was before the wife spotted all that stripper glitter on my clothing. (What is it about that shit that makes it stick to everything, it's as if it has glue on it or something.)  Anyway, I find myself in the unenviable position of kissing her ass, trying to make up for boy's night out - so what do I do? Something monumentally stupid.  I ask what she's got planned for the day, suggesting how I may tag along if it's interesting enough but really it's mere penance for my cretinous acts. What a mistake.   Everything in my machismo being is intuitively screaming; BAIL!  This is all wrong I quietly think to myself, then I see the nail technician.  Some hot Asian babe with mountainous tits and a low cut top.  This is where I reason it may not be so bad after all. Especially considering where I'm seated for the pedi and where she'll be seated.  Ok, I'm liking this now.  In fact, I'm loving it as I vegetatively (still hungover) sit, my gaze fixed on her bags hoping to catch sight of a nip slip. This was when the unthinkable happened.  Just as she's getting into it - scrubbing my dogs with the vigor of someone on clothes washing day in the Ganges - her shit jiggling all over the place, she stands up, towels off, and bails. WTF???  Turns out she was just the prep-girl who washes dogs. The real practitioner, a large Asian woman who uncannily resembled a sumo wrestler, posted up at my feet. I quickly surmised this wasn't going to be good. Shit.  But even with the lack of peep show from my dream girl's successor, it turned out to be a nice relaxing event. Especially when she rubbed my legs down with some kind of abrasive stuff.  As I said, there's no reason for me to be in a nail salon, unless I consider how afterwards there won't be any glitter conversation to contend with.   It cost me around twenty bucks with the tip, and, I never saw any nip. My first and last pedicure.

A ten dollar gift certificate arrives in the mail from SLT. In print fashioned for a person of advancing years, a notice at the bottom reads;                                   NO PURCHASE NECESSARY  Load up the car baby, we're headed to Sur La Table!  We spent 92 dollars after receiving our unwarranted ten dollar prize, however, the event did yield a cathartic moment.  I now know the pride one (wife) feels when sashaying about, in an all-too-obvious proud-shopper moment, explaining how she saved ten dollars today.  I totally get it now. Thanks Sur La Table. Or not?

Stopped in last night for a beer, wings and a cheese-steak and once again I wasn't disappointed. The heat level of the wings is probably one or two notches above most wing places so be careful, their medium is most peoples hot. The cheese steak is just like being back in Philly, in fact, no restaurant I've been to in Phoenix Metro serving these denizens of bovine delight comes anywhere close. I even got to watch the NBA finals on one of their many tv screens. Its always a good experience, the servers are friendly, motivated and quick to respond. A meal (18 wings, 4 pints of Blue Moon and two cheese stakes was in the mid 30 buck range. This is one of the few places where you can order your wings extra crispy and they actually arrive extra crispy.  I love this place.

My so-called 'life coach' called last week from jail asking if I'd come down and throw his bail. I knew something about the guy didn't smell right when he told me I could turn vegan by simply limiting my diet to beer and Cheetos. What an asshole.  Anyway, I'm at Uncle Sam's when he calls, mainly because they have cheap beer...their 'bailout' plan as it's called. I call it my vegan plan. Sixteen ounce Coor's and Miller light drafts for $1.25 every day from 3 to 7. Dos Equis Amber for $1.50.  Loosely translated, this means I can throw back ninety six ounces for nine bucks, putting me squarely in the .0143  B.A.L. range. If I extrapolate these figures over the course of their four-hour happy hour, I figure I'm around thirty bucks in for around two and a half gallons and a solid .30 BAL. Pretty righteous, eh?  And the food. The philly cheesesteak is my favorite, followed by one of the white pizza's and a dozen (actually 13) crispy hot wings. It should be noted at least one of the 13 is from a chicken who looks like it may have been a troublemaker, the farmer hobbling its wing with a hammer or something.  Anyway, the guy IS my neighbor, so it's the least I can do to bail him out.  But i am firing him as my life coach, the little prick, and I'm also demanding his parents pony up the three hundred on his bail.

Does this happen to you?  You're getting ready for bed, admiring your stunning good looks and thinking, I'd better apply some skin cream if I want to remain this good-looking fore.v.e.r. No, I'm not gay.  I simply know the importance of good skin care, having lived my entire life in this oven we call Phoenix. So I reach for whatever product my wife happens to be using...Clinique, LaMer, whatever. The next morning, as I look in the mirror while simultaneoulsly scratching myself, (because I'm cute like that in the morning) I see what appears to be a magical forest of white flakes all around my nose and eyebrows.  I'm like a fucking mushroom patch.  That's when I decided to go see Dr. Cummings, the highest rated skin care specialist in the entire universe. Or at least Arizona. She diagnosed it as dandruff. Go figure.  And the remedy? Not a costly prescription. Oh contraire. A bottle of Head & Shoulders. This saved me an assload on expensive prescriptions. YEA!  No more LaMer face wash, moisturizer, or face spritzer.  No more wife yelling at me, telling me how much LaMer costs, and that I should stick with Irish Spring or just buy my own. And no more white flakes routinely raining onto my cherry desk at work, making it look like I'm an austere coke addict.  Props to Dr. Cummings, Dr. Neil, and the young hispanic woman who stood in the room while I disrobed. I still don't know why she was there. Pretty eclectic though.

Fry's, what's wrong with you? I heard a news report you laid-off your greeters last week, sending them packing.  Shame on you.  The reporter explained how these people were part time, stating they would each receive a 200 dollar severance package and presumably, a goodbye card from HR. What a nice sendoff.  A card signed by a gaggle of the victim's co-worker's, most of whom they probably never even knew.  Well that's generous of you.   Did it ever occur to you that maybe you didn't need to lose the greeter but instead lose the idiot whom, while I'm trying to shop in a four foot wide aisle comes waltzing down the aisle with a three foot wide dust-mop making me squeeze to the side, hoping like hell I don't knock something made of glass and full of liquid off the shelf?  I know you don't care what I have to say, but I can pretty much guarantee that most people would much rather have a smiling face hand them a shopping cart free from toddler spittle (or vomit, tears, diaper leakage or any other human exfoliation) than they would having some non-smiling buffoon mindlessly cruise the aisles with his 'get the fuck outa my way' broom and Ipod earphones.  I hate sounding cliche, but I'm just sayin. Bonehead move, Fry's.

The bar, while fun and lively, is littered with sixty-somethings shuffling around the dance floor to Jimmy Buffet tunes.  The band is good. But those haunting images of old men on bar stools... in Hawaiian shirts...hunkered over... head propped-up by one arm resting on the bar,  well that's just sad. I hope I never get like that but I think it's inevitable.  That's what men do when they get old. They become miserable. And by being miserable, they make guys like me miserable.  Part of the great cosmic circle of life.  I ate "The Three Amigos."  No, not a dick buffet....Jesus! What's the matter with you? Three Amigos is a menu item featuring three enchiladas; one chicken, one cheese and one red chili. Pretty tasty. Ten bucks, I think.  I can't believe you. You really thought for a moment  I went down on three old Mexican dudes from the bar? Way fucking uncool!   Kelli is an absolute charm. Best server I've ever had. Left her a big tip and a note reading;    "Thanks for such great service...The 3 Amigos were delicious, great suggestion."  STOP IT!

We have a trade concept here in America whereby the patron pays for an item, and the vendor hands over the item paid for. It's that simple. And, it works at most places in America, except McDonald's.  At McDonald's, you pay for something at one window and hope to receive it at the next. But McDonald's doesn't believe in this concept.  McDonald's believes in taking your money at one window and at the next, instead of handing over your food, they hand you nothing but a friendly smile and request you pull ahead, saying "We'll bring your order right out when it's ready."  Fundamentally, this concept is wrong on many levels, but for the sake of verbosity, I'll spare you all but two.  First, as I said, I paid for something at the window. I want to leave the window with something other than some Mexican kid smiling at me with his gold-rimmed tooth, asking me in broken english to please pull up.  Second, I beat my ass in traffic to cut-off the car turning left into the drive-thru, and now, that fucker has his food onboard, and is likely picking at his french fries. While I on the other hand am parked in the penalty zone for ordering something I knew they'd have to make fresh....something I knew they wouldn't have sitting under those little heat lamps for the last two hours.   So I stopped going to McDonalds.  Their sixteen year-old 'managers' AND their 'please pull ahead' concept can suck a big one.   This is why I go to Whataburger.  At Whataburger, I can get their signature burger, 'The Whataburger', (wow...go figure) a coke and large fries for somewhere around eight bucks. My burger also has lots of mustard, pickles and jalapenos, (on request). All stuff I enjoy.  And, they never ask me to pull ahead. Something I appreciate in a fast-food place.  Whataburger. Where the only time you'll hear the person at the window ask you to pull ahead is when you take too long rifling through your bags, trying to find some salt for your fries, but are too stoned to locate practically anything.   Note: I love Whataburger so much, I bought one of their baseball caps online. (see photo),

Been thinking about how best to spruce up that resume? Employers are always looking for signs of creativity and not just some run-of-the-mill MBA, fresh out of WP Carey honors college. Employers want REAL creativity.  This is why I recommend the Scottsdale Gun Club. A couple of sessions here with your 9mm Glock, followed by a few tequila shots next door at K. O'Donnells, and you'll be ready to knock off that Seven-Eleven, this of course to augment your unemployment check.   Not only can you add the term 'Lone Gunman' to your already accomplished resume, if you hit the 7-11 on Friday night, you'll have some extra holiday spending cash from all their liquor sales. (Try to pick one in South Phoenix).  Keep up the good work, and remember,  America runs on Noslers!

You're still in denial. Three arrests in the last six months, a family intervention... a failed suicide attempt  and, a short stint in rehab. (hospital, not Hard Rock). There's only one sure way to drop this meth habit for good. Taser.  Yes, Taser delivers its own unique brand of intervention with over 50,000 volts of reality, and for free no less. Simply tussle with a few police officers during one of your meth-fueled domestic violence 'incidents', and before you know it, you'll be laying in a heap swearing off meth forever.   I haven't tried Taser yet, but have several friends on the Phoenix police department who've helped change many lives. In some cases, for good.   Taser totally rocks.

There are days when I wake up feeling a bit down. It's hard to describe the low mood, but I think the best analogy would be a fleck of whale shit resting on the lowest part of the Continental Shelf.  Not even depression meds help when this mood hits.   I don't reach for my dad's 50 caliber Desert Eagle. And I don't sit around thinking up flamboyant ways to off myself that will make all my friends, like; "Wow dude, he really kissed himself with a fireplace poker?"  Thinking this way accomplishes nothing, other than the good feelings I get fantasizing about the many millions who showed up at my funeral and are now so distraught their lives will be in upheaval forever.  There's only one remedy for me.  WalMart.  WalMart is the place where I go for solace.  To remind myself that I have all my teeth, I don't have a bubble-butt with a ledge (in yoga pants), that I know the difference between Armani and Martha Stewart, I can count without the aid of my digits, I don't breathe through my mouth, and I know enough to not wear a tie-dyed beater two sizes two small, exposing my midriff.  If there was ever such thing as 'comfort food for the brain" this is it.   God bless America and Sam Walton, his billionaire heirs and heiresses, and all the uber-losers who shop there and while doing so,  unknowingly recharge my self esteem batteries.  Note: I don't mean to imply everyone who shops at WalMart is an uber loser. They're not.  It's more akin to spotting a punch-buggy in traffic.  They're there. You know they're there. You just need to scour the aisles until you find one....hitting self esteem gold.

Does that bad case of taco-butt have you rethinking your entire wiping strategy as you feverishly pick at your ass? Well hold on.  Before changing your wiping habits, I'm going to share a little secret with you.  White Cloud toilet paper. The only sure-fire cure for taco-butt that I know of, short of carrying a pouch of wet wipes, or a torn piece of wet flannel around with you.  Yes, White Cloud is the answer to your dirty-starfish prayers. It even has you covered on those hungover Saturday mornings when mud-butt rules the day. One small problem however.  You won't find White Cloud at your local grocer any longer. Not at Basha's. Or Fry's.  Or Albertson's.  Not even Walgreens or CVS...none of them. Know why? White Cloud sold the entire product line to WalMart.  How genius a move was that? Or not.   Maybe it was some savvy management exec at Walmart who reckoned that if White Cloud was the only cure (sans wet-wipes) for taco-butt, and WalMart owned the rights to White Cloud, then it's highly probable Walmart would capture the entire U.S taco-butt demographic. Fucking genius!  Well hey WalMart, you'll be happy to know it worked.  I now shop at WalMart for my White Cloud among other things.   I have no idea how much it costs. I can only recommend it's cleaning power and how the term taco-butt will soon be exiting your lexicon for good.

I know what's going to happen. I can see it now. I tell you about this place. You get all "Holy Shit!" I had no idea you could do that. And I get screwed in the process.   First, stop going to DMV.  This shouldn't be a problem, since you already avoid the place like your urologist's latest STD results. Begin going to L & J. They offer every service DMV does, but here's the kicker, they only charge a small fee. Like ten bucks. So the question is....would you rather sit and wait for three hours, as others check out your tats and whisper to one another?  Or pay the ten bucks...no line...get in...out...and back to your life.   You'll like L & J Your friends and relatives will like L & J And eventually, I won't, when I have to wait in line because I told you about this little gem. Don't think I did this for you. I did it because my therapist said to do something nice for someone for a change and how it'd make me feel better about myself. It didn't and I don't.

They should change the name to Streets of Bejing because their pizza, wings, and sandwiches are about as far from New York as anything I've ever experienced!  Even the worst New York pizza is better than what this place is serving up. The wings tasted like they were dipped in vinegar.  No flavor. I've eaten at this location several times, each time thinking how maybe I just got a bad dish, or they were off their game that day. Not the case.   Good thing for the owners how most people in Arizona who enjoy S.O.N.Y. have never tasted real New York Pizza and wings, otherwise they'd have been out of business long ago. I will never grace their doorstep again, even if they were giving it away!

When you visit Kierland, you'll have many restaurant options, but none will be as rewarding as Chloe's Corner Deli.  Not being a 'bunny-food' aficionado, I threw a tantrum in Kierland Common's main square when my wife insisted we eat there, despite my penchant for PF Changs on this day.  My arms firmly crossed and pressed closely to my chest, stomping my feet down in obvious disgust, and finally, plopping my butt down, (arms still folded) I  began to cry. This is when she dragged me to my feet and towed me into the deli.  After ordering, (still crying) we sat outside, enjoying the spring-like temperatures. That's not all we enjoyed. We enjoyed the food once I got over my little hissy fit.  I learned a couple things that day. One.  If your wife is wearing non-matching bra and panties with her hair pulled back... a beret resembling a tiara, it's likely you're married to Wonder Woman and never knew it. Because despite your best attempt to remain glued to the sidewalk in a tantrum-like state, she WILL pick you up and drag you into the deli.  Like it or not.  Second.  The spirit of Harriet Tubman (Underground Railway, google her) lives on.  I say this because I firmly believe there's a network of women who secretly share the best places to have lunch, as this place was crawling with 'The Salad Network'.

Has this ever happened to you?  It's late and you just got home from a weeklong business trip. You have no clothes to wear and you don't feel like doing laundry. You gather everything up, throw it in your Delia's loyal customer bag and race down there before closing time. They tell you to pick-up tomorrow after 2pm.  It's Saturday at 3, time to pick up your laundry. Saturday at 4...you're sick to your stomach.  Somehow, in your rush to take your pants, shirts and sports jackets in for laundering, a pile of your freshly skid-marked tighty whiteys must have been hiding out in either the jackets or pant legs.  Because now, freshly laundered and still bearing the telltale signs of your less than skiilful wiping abilities, are several pairs of your underpants....washed, pressed and neatly packaged in a box.   And this is what you'll love about Delia's. There's another location less than 3 miles away on Market Street in DC Ranch, rescuing you from the horror of ever returning to the scene of the crime, and, from a staff who will forever refer to you as 'skid-mark dude' behind your back.   Thank-you Delias. Not for the loyal customer bag with my name on it, the one that  let the entire staff know who the guy was that brought in the rude briefs.  For having multiple locations a few short miles from one another.

Sage advice isn't exactly my calling unless we're talking about how to remove a bottle cap from a Corona bottle with your teeth....then you're in MY wheelhouse.  "Firmly bite down on the edge of the cap with your rear molars, but don't try to pry it off, not unless you want to break a tooth. Instead, bite down firmly, then  simply lift the bottle toward your cheek and voila, you're a human church key."  I've spewed this wisdom for years, and now, here I sit with one missing molar and another in need of a tug.  Go figure.  Dr. Daches, much to my chagrin does not do implants, but he did recommend the same guy he sent his daughter to. Diane, my hygienist has to be one of the happiest people I've ever met. She routinely hummed a beautiful melody throughout my cleaning, and the funny thing was how no music was playing in the office...only her.  At one point, I felt like a swarm of bluebirds were about to swoop in and assist her, like  a scene from a Disney movie or something.  I enjoyed my brief visit with Diane and the doctor. Diane actually gave me hope once again..... That the world isn't such a bad place after all. That some people are truly happy. And, that with a little practice using an actual bottle opener, molars #17 and #18 might have a happier ending than did their counterparts, #31 and #32.  Disclaimer: Routinely popping off bottle caps is in direct conflict with the ADA's guidelines for proper care and maintenance of your teeth. I strongly urge you not to try this. It took years of practice and all it got me was a date with an implant specialist. That and a lot of scolding by my wife.

Here's a useful tip. Don't ever come here on a weekday around the noon hour. If you do, expect the following:  * No place to park. The place is besieged by Suburbans and Escalades....Notre Dame Prep seniors on their lunch period.....arrghh.  * One of those serpentine lines like at the airport, where you uncomfortably find yourself standing beside the same person each time the line moves up. Typically a high school senior looking at you, thinking...Jeez, I hope I never end up like that. {likely my ball cap, reading...This face seats five.....the sweats don't help much either)  * Indifferent servers, probably instructed to skinny-up the meat portions to anyone winking at them or making that hand gesture...the one with the thumb and forefinger signaling,...just a teensy bit more, please?  * And no place to sit. The seniors now in control, launching a full-scale assault on the table seating area.  Like a loser with a cute (to me, ewww to them) ball cap, you take your seat at one of the stools facing the parking lot...your backside to the seniors. This as you gaze out the window at the expensive cars piloted by teenagers, who, while walking by, not a fucking care in the world, look at you like you're a lone zoo exhibit or something.  I hope reincarnation exists.  I want to come back as one of these guys.  I wander. Sorry. The burrito bowl is my favorite. Here's a little secret. Refuse the rice and beans. When your bowl passes to the meat section. upon their seeing an empty bowl, the server will fill it to its gunwales with meat. Once the meat's safely on board, conveniently go "OOPS, I changed my mind...maybe I will have some rice and beans after all."  Works every time.  And no, I'm not homeless, thank you very much.

For some reason I only come here when I'm angry at the world. And by world I mean my wife. And by angry, I mean eye daggers, not Ak-47's..  Yes, whenever I find myself in that weird place, too tired for a lingering sit-down dining experience, yet not hungry enough for a double Whopper with cheese, I come here. But not before a series of long and drawn-out interrogatories from my wife.  Her:  "What are you in the mood for?"  Me: "Nothing, I want to go home, have a drink and crash."  Her: "How's Mexican sound?"  Me: "Not as good as a Crown and soda."  Her: "Italian?"  Me: [tightening up like a little kid, facial muscles now squinched] "I want to go home."  Her: "What about, I know, Thai...you love Thai."  Me: [with all the aplomb I can muster] "Can we please just go home?"   Her: [not talking now, whipping her car into the Chipotle parking lot]  Me: [to cashier] Uh, yeah, give me three Dos Equis Ambers, a bag of chips and some guac."  Her: "Seriously?"  As I said, I only come here when I'm angry.  Three Dos Equis Amber, guac, chips, and three tacos...twenty three bucks. The look on her face throughout 'dinner'....not so priceless.

For all you men with a penchant for changing your own oil, here's a useful tip. Try Jiffy Lube, and let me tell you why in three little letters.                       **  UTI  **  Yes, those grease stained paws of yours have now left their mark on your spouse's hoo-haw, sparking yet another angry and virulent UTI, this followed by an unexpected playground closure for about a week.  Who needs that shit, right? Not when Jiffy Lube is right down the street. I say spend the extra twenty bucks, let them change your oil, sparing your partner from the weeklong misery of peeing razor blades all the while keeping you squarely in coochville.  Don't get suckered into all the extras they offer though. They'll want to change the grease in your axles, flush your radiator, and change out your transmission fluid, saying all of this stuff is yukky and long overdue. Don't buy it. I did this once and it cost me upwards of 200 bucks. Now I limit them to oil and filter only for around forty bucks, and that's for a truck. Cars are even less.  I promise you, whatever you think you're saving by doing this task yourself, it's not what you think it is.  You need to toss in a doctor's visit along with a couple gallons of cranberry juice if you want to make a truly accurate cost comparison.

Whenever I feel a surge of testosterone, that unmistakable wave of manliness washing over me, I go to the Scottsdale Gun Club.  What's that got to do with K O'Donnell's? Plenty. After my testosterone ridden shooting session, I mosey on into K's, (less than a hundred feet from the Gun Club) for some brews and people watching, where both are above average.  The patio looks cool but I don't like going out there since there are a plethora of typical Scottsdale men, (douche-nozzles) sitting out there smoking what appear to be giant horse dicks.   The food, mainly bar fare, is good, but the chicken sandwich is terrific. The ambiance is friendly and the bartenders are attentive.  Not "I'll listen to how screwed-up your life is and pretend like I give-a-shit" attentive, more like refilling my beer when I still have half a glass remaining.   They're also skilled at knowing when to cut you off and politely ask you to leave when they hear you bragging about how you just won forty dollars from some guy in the men's room for target peeing into a cup from four feet away.   One would think that would get you a free beer. I guess times are changing.

Do you believe in the hereafter? Well not anymore. Because whatever it is you came hereafter, you're not going to find it.  Why? This is the Denny's of Mexican Food. Look around. Notice anything? Like how there's no Mexican's anywhere in sight? That's never a good sign.  Folks, when you can't even get a Mexican to eat here, you might as well be selling roadkill.

The only way I would ever eat here again is if.....   1. Every restaurant in the world has closed except Arriba  2. I died and was reincarnated with no taste buds  3. I'd just smoked some chronic and had already finished off all the moldy stuff in my fridge  4. I was a rat.  5. I was a cockroach.  5a. I was a  rat who'd eaten a cockroach and wanted to get the taste out of its         mouth.  6. I was King or Emperor or something, wielding enough power to have the head chef tortured if he fucked up my meal.  7. Roadkill no longer existed.  8. There was a nuclear holocaust and for some strange reason, this was the only      place left standing.  9. I'd just been released from a mental hospital. 10. My in-laws were visiting from the east coast and wanted to 'try some really good Mexican'. 11. I lost a bet. 12. I needed to get out going to church, blaming  'food poisoning' as the culprit. 13. I'd just landed the role of surly waiter in a major Hollywood film, and needed to        practice the part by understudying the real thing. 14. I was into philanthropy and accustomed to the idea of throwing money away. 15. I was on my deathbed, and my family refused to honor my living will by not       pulling the plug on me. I'd ask them to take me here for one more meal where I'd       die on the spot.  My waiter was a major sphincter, telling us about the happy hour Margarita for 4.99 when a moment later, he informed the couple in the next booth of their 'famous' 99 cent margarita. I want my four bucks back.  When I ordered the taco salad for 9.99, trying to be helpful, he suggested I order the salad on the next page..the one for 11.99. I did. It came with cold chicken tasting as though it had been boiled. The lettuce was layered with gobs of sour cream and featured rust spots. I ate about two bites before sending it back.   Arriba, between its sphinct-o-waiter and the god-awful, overpriced food, was so bad, if I had to compare it with shit, shit would win.   Even some rare form of shit only found on the bottom of the ocean, left there by some deep sea creature who's never been photographed.   Please tell all your snowbird friends about this place.

Closing time. You hand your ticket to the valet and wait in line with the others as car after car pulls up. The girl in front of you is hot. She thinks you're hot and begins talking to you.  While you're talking, a Benz rolls up. Heads turn. Everyone oohs and ahhs, including hot girl. Another Benz rolls up, and once again, your conversation is interrupted by the silence that is everyone's gawking. It's about that time you're wishing you hadn't cheaped out, opting for that RAV4 instead of the C-300. You may have gotten hot girl to go home with you if you had.  Oh who are you kidding, the 300 isn't for you anyway.  True, it'd get you a ticket with hot girl and, there's always the part where it'll save your bacon in an accident with it's twenty or so airbags...the result of your perma-fucked driving skills from all the E and Moscow Mules. Super score.   But sadly, you get into the RAV4 and drive home by yourself, hoping upon hope itself a tree doesn't leap out in front of you along the way.  No worries, tomorrow is another day.  Go to Shumacher and ask for Remington. I bought many cars from him when I was riding dirty.  Now I'm back in a RAV4. Big shout-out to Wall Street.

If you bake, and are good at it, then let me make a suggestion.  Try this place.  No matter how good you think you are, or what your friends and family say about your baked goods, they're lying. Probably because they like you and don't want to hurt your feelings.   You need to do this. If for no other reason, so you can see how the shit you've been baking all these years is slightly better than an Easy Bake Oven recipe.  But that's not why I go here. I go here for their cranberry scones, which taste just like my moms. But mom is gone now, and with her, all of her recipes since my whore of a sister absconded with them, forcing me to visit on a fairly regular basis.   Which brings me back to my youth, when we would routinely pull a 'dine n dash', running out of the restaurant after a meal.  Well I'm pretty sure the owner knows what he's got with those scones....he's got the little fuckers under glass, behind another curtain of glass, and totally out of reach.  It's like he's guarding the Hope Diamond or something.   No dine n dash even remotely possible here.  You'll have to pay for them, unless your'e so inclined toward boosting the joint, which if you do, I hope you get caught, sentenced for armed robbery,  and as your grand finale, butt-raped in prison when the inmates on your cell block learn you're doing a five year stretch on a scone armed robbery.

Its a typical Saturday morning.  You're hungover, and the girl laying next to you, the one who looked like a million bucks last night, now looks like the face on an Indian Penny.  You want her gone, but for some reason, she's loitering.  Stalling.  Putting off the inevitable cab ride / walk  'o shame, despite your best efforts to assure her you'll call.  Then something comes out of her mouth so stupefying, it's got you re-thinking your entire life. "Hey, it's Saturday" she says, "Why don't we head up to Rock Springs for the Hogs 'n Heat barbecue party?" She just said the magic word. Barbecue. Nothing, you reason, could be better for this headache than some pulled pork and a few beers. Maybe the drive and the fresh air will help, you reason. She goes on. "Its not just barbecue...oh its all the usual stuff...brisket, chicken, ribs. But they've got this thing I really love, something you can't get anywhere else... Rocky Mountain Oysters."  Did she just say what I think she said?  She wants me to drive her 50 or so miles so she can eat testicles? Holy shit, who is this person. Some kind of Nazi War Criminal? Jesus!  Fear sets in as you reason how YOUR balls could be her next meal if you don't concede to her unusual gastronomic request. Hungover, and with all the countenance of a zombie, you drive to Rock Springs.   The first few beers slide down. They go good with the free popcorn in the bar. Then a couple of shots. The barbecue is fantastic...the hangover winding down.  And finally the coup de gras as you watch her wolf down an entire plate of nuts.  You're sick again, and before losing it altogether, yakking on a faux-biker and getting shot to death, you wander off.  It's there you find, like a shining beacon of light, Aunt Jenny's Pie Stand in all its glory.  Time for a break from all of this nonsense.  You grab a pie, head for the parking lot, and finally rid yourself of this bovine-eating Nazi once and for all.   As you're driving home, the Jack Daniels pecan pie slopped all over your being, a wave of terror washes over you, realizing how she knows where you live. You turn the car around. This isn't over yet. God help you.

If you're a straight male like me, your sense of fashion has probably never evolved much past third grade.  * Button-down 501's * Oxford button down shirt * Roper boots  So try Thaku's. The owner, Neil, has dressed me for years. I simply go in, tell him the nature of the event, and he picks out the perfect outfit.  I've got yellow, purple, and red sport coats. Linen pants. Silk ties. And custom made shirts that allow you to count my entire thirty pack.  Crazy awesome props to Neil for making me look not only fashionable, but gay enough to get hit on by even the cutest of dudes.  I don't believe I just said that.

You don't need a kiss that begins with Kay. What you need is some straight-up ass kissing right now.  Your banker has always wanted you for more than just a client, only now she's drunk and pawing all over you at a charity event, in front of your wife no less. Houston, we have a problem.  Your fashion ensemble for the evening, linen trousers, may not have been the best choice. Concealing your basket at this point, who has not only woken from his slumbers, but appears to be going for a morning stretch, is now impossible.  You quickly untuck your Ed Hardy shirt from your pants. Too late.  Your wife, ever on guard duty at these types of events, almost like a German WW ll officer guarding the prison barracks, has caught glimpse of the little prisoner and quickly concluded he's about to make a break for it.   No talking your way out of this one...you're fucked proper now.  But there is a way out of this conundrum. It's called jewelry. Enter Naughton Jewelers.  The Naughton sisters, longtime Phoenix residents and purveyors of marital bliss (or at best marital salvage) can save your pathetic bacon.  If you're in a predicament such as this with no way out other than jewelry, these fine ladies, similar to a wine tasting event,  possess the uncanny ability to pair the proper piece of jewelry with the crime. Making sure you don't go overboard with a pair of one carat studs when all you really needed for this impropriety was a peuter unicorn charm with a 1/4 carat rock sitting on its horn.  Yup.  You're out of the woods for less than five hundred bucks, and not the $6,000 you believed it would take to reopen her playground. Pretty cheap for a party boner if you ask me.  Caught red-handed? Who needs those big chain jewelers anyway, like Kay. Go see the Naughtons, where every ass-kiss begins with Naughton.  That doesn't flow, does it? Not like Kay's anyway.

The aroma of flame broiled meat envelopes you upon entering. It's a glorious smell to a practicing carnivore, one prompting you to salivate like a St. Bernard on a hot summer's day.  There's a window where you order, and after a short wait, they'll call you to pick up your order by name. I like this concept since I typically opt for a name out of the ordinary...today I was Thorgon.  The 'fixin's bar is an old covered wagon and has a fun feel to it. Condiments are plenty with the layout similar to Fuddrucker's. Lot of tv's abound if sporting events are your thing, since all appeared to be tuned to some type of sporting event.   The burger was spectacular, inexpensive and very filling, but the aroma, that smell wafting through your neighborhood that has you wondering which of your neighbors is barbecuing Sunday afternoon, is the smell that'll keep you coming back here for more.  In a word, it's glorious.

Are you the type of person who likes to explore new places? A true adventurer by definition? Have I got a hot one for you; 43rd Express, aka; 'Pho 43rd'.  Owned by the same Vietnamese family for over twenty years, Pho 43rd, despite its dive-like ambiance both inside and out, is truly a charm.  The pho is above average and served with all the accoutrements; bean sprouts, Vietnamese basil, and jalapenos.  Try the beef, tripe and tendon pho, asking them to conspicuously leave out the tendon and tripe. (I never said I was an adventurer, I only asked if you were) It's delicious.  Their sauces are a delight, featuring a traditional siracha, their own chili paste, and a delicious homemade hoisin sauce.  Spring rolls were light and wonderfully tasty. A strong recommend.  The service is fast and very friendly. Upon leaving, the owner introduced himself and gave us a brief history of the restaurant:  -How he and his brother worked in the kitchen since they were small children. -How the family has owned the restaurant for over twenty years, surviving the great recession.  -How mom is now retired, passing on the family business to her sons.   His story was impressive. One that makes anyone not familiar with the restaurant industry know just how difficult it is to succeed in this type of business, with all the hard work and sacrifice. Pho 43rd ceased to be a dive at that point, embodying the true spirit of capitalism and the American dream.  I left, feeling both satiated, and proud of David (owner) and his family for what they've accomplished.  If you're disinclined to visit a place like this based on its location and outward appearance, you'll be missing out.   IMPORTANT NOTE: THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH.

You're a Yelper.  Adventurous by nature. Always seeking the good life and with it, all of its spoils. But really, you're all talk. Your grand idea of adventure is 'trying Ethiopian' tonight.   Isn't it high time you busted-out of that Scottsdale bubble for some real adventure? Come on down to Michele's. This is the place I hang until rush hour traffic has cleared and can effortlessly navigate three freeway systems back to my North Scottsdale enclave each night.  I wish I could say come join me for a glass of wine, or a cocktail, or appys, maybe even a craft beer, but I can't.  There is no such thing. Not here.  The only thing you'll find here is Bud on tap, and a rack of potato chips behind the bar. Well, that and the wino's, drug dealers, and old women who are so cliche, you'll never wonder again why our society has a shelter for women.   This is a taste of counter culture at it's finest, people. Try it. But if you do, here are some tips.  Only go in daylight hours. Leave the Range Rover at home, take your friends beat-up rice grinder. No skinny jeans, heels, or fashion of any kind. No purse or clutch. No watch, bling or any type of bedazzled accessories. And no Iphone. They'll know you're not one of them as you walk around holding your phone up snapping pics you plan to post on FB later. Leave the phone in the car. And I'd only go in with several of your biggest guy friends. You should probably bring that one guy friend who's been known to go mental on occasion, that wouldn't hurt either.  Now enjoy your afternoon of Budweisers, Funyuns, and 1960's circa cowboy tunage blaring from the old Wurlitzer.  Michele's also has four nice pool tables, plenty of booths, and a men's bathroom that'll put your bladder's holding ability to the ultimate test.  Isn't it time you stretched your social wings? Think of it as a field trip, where you can see all of humanity's-ass warts gathered up in one cozy little corner of the city, save for me of course.  Oh, and bring a gun.

Depressed? Thinking about taking that final plunge? Well before you do, take a moment to think about someone other than your fucking self for just a New York minute.   Why put your family through any more grief than need be? They've already got your suicide to contend with, and now, unexpectedly, they're dealing with funeral and burial arrangements?  Pretty fucking selfish, don't ya think?   Give them one final gift (other than your ending), by making your own funeral / burial arrangements. It's simple, fast, and, at Greenwood Memory Lawn, you'll slide through the process like a pig on ice.  The friendly folks at Greenwood will walk you through all the funeral and burial options even though you already know you're going with El Cheapo.  I liked their funeral plan features, since most allow me to deny anyone the right to a eulogy while at the same time, honor my wishes for the type of music being played throughout the proceedings. I like this since I'm certain my wife would freak if she knew Rammstein's Du Haust was about to reverberate from the chapel walls.  Burial options are easy too, in the end amounting to either fire or worms, and since I have an aversion to fire, (dead or alive) I'm going with worms. If you do go with the deep six, they offer four fine packages. I like the 'Tribute', since I probably don't qualify for the Honor, Legacy, or Heritage packages.  Those packages presume you did something worthwhile as a human. I didn't, and besides, there's no shame in the Tribute option.  It's a pretty decent package, offering 2 casket choices and, more importantly, one of five Family Support Options.  I'll be selecting the Memory Portrait option, mainly because I want to be remembered as the real me, even if it is a picture of me diving naked off a cliff at Havasu. I thought this would be a fine remembrance for loved ones and besides, it just felt right. I thought about the 'Asset Protection' feature instead of the Memory Portrait, but after Wall Street fucked me blind in their 2008 Great American Pillage, (some call it the Great Recession) there's nothing left but the pictures, memories and one very fancy coke spoon.  Anyway, if you're not a veteran, and, you're fairly certain no-one is going to want you in a genie bottle on their mantle, this seems like the best choice.  Greenwood is located in South Phoenix, but with their National Transferability program, you can be buried anywhere in North America, so long as it's 75 miles from where you live now, making a drug overdose in a Mexican border town not out of the realm of possibilities.

You love a good green chile dish, especially Hatch chiles.  You also have no particular regard for your bumhole, evidenced by your routine attempts to set it ablaze the next day with your pepper infused crap.  Well have I got good news for you.  Rita's Mexican Food.  Rita's offers one of the finest green chile dishes I've ever experienced, transcending most Mexican food joints by miles. On my last visit, I tried bowl of green chile stew. It was hot.  No, wait, let me rephrase that...         It was FUCKING HOT.  It was so hot, it sent me into a sneezing session the scientists at Claritin would have marveled at.  Then I started crying.  Like a little bitch and, I got all snotted-up too.  But god, was it ever good. The service...not so much.   In fact, the service wasn't anything to write home about. Not that you would anyway, even if it was good. Making me wonder why people invoke that stupid cliche anyway? I doubt seriously I'd ever leave a restaurant, go home, whip out my laptop and write my folks about how wonderful my lunch service was.  But if I did, this is how it would go:  Dear Mom and Dad.  The place where I ate lunch today had such good service, I thought I had better write to tell you about it. Because that's what people do right? They get good service and write home. Unlike when you get bad service, and simply fail to write about it. This is why I'm writing home. I got good service and just thought you both should know all about it. But this seems like service hypocrisy in a sense, which is why I'll probably start writing you when I get bad service as well, despite its lack of anything to write home about.  Anyways, that's it for now.  Expect more emails. I eat out often.   Your loving son,  Diego

Rita's offers some great menu choices. Menudo is not one of them.  But seeing how most people detest the thought of eating cooked bovine stomach, I can't see how this qualifies as any sort of problem. Oh, they don't serve Coke products either.   Being a south Phoenix native and a menudo aficionado, I'm uniquely qualified to discern good menudo from bad menudo. This is definitely a bad recipe.  The broth has too much of a tomato base and tastes weird. The tripe is overcooked and flubbery.  Overall, it's pretty disgusting.  So if you're having a weird day, with a penchant for menudo and a caffeine free diet Coke, forget it.  Instead, have an ice cold Pepsi and a green chili burrito.  Try their chips and salsa too.  Four stars for the server's gigantic hangers.  Overall, Rita's is a good restaurant but their menudo does suck balls.

Your major is sociology and the assignment is exploring idiosyncrasies of various counter cultures.  But you procrastinated when the professor was doling out the choices.  Now there are only two left.  Rednecks and Bikers. You choose the former, but now comes the dilemma.  Where in Phoenix can you study rednecks in their natural habitat? (bars and brothels excluded) Well look no further. Kay's is your first stop.   Kay's is located in an industrial section of Phoenix surrounded by farms, nearby cattle ranches and all around shit. Surrounded by junkyards, (replete with junkyard dogs) - packs of wild dogs roaming the streets and a gigantic garbage dump next door -  Kay's offers the finest in redneck watching. Yes,the people who harbor these dogs, drive combines, milk cows, and do garbage dumpy stuff all light here, at Kay's.  Yes, Kay's will deliver that down-home atmosphere you're seeking, that is, if down home happens to be the back woods of West Virginia. Home to the dentifrice challenged, Kay's is where men wear Wranglers, Roper boots, and all things Carrhart. No fancy jeans here. Here you'll find men whose musk isn't Old Spice or Axe, but Dow Chemical's #105 or Union Carbide's Weevil 'B Gone.  Go inside, take a seat and eavesdrop on the next table, let's get started with that assignment, shall we?  Redneck breakfast-goer:  "N  I told that little brown puke, this here's Amerca boy, 'n if you don't like it,you can gettttt  the fuuuuckkkk out!, you lil rice-eatin, bean-fartin motherfucker."  Redneck's little buddy:  "N  whad he say Earll?"  Redneck:   "Lil sumbitch jumped in his '64 Impala 'n made tracks, probably fer Me-hee-co."   Little buddy:  "Sposin you tol him Earll."  I love going to Kay's for breakfast, but never lunch, even though their lunch specials are to die for. Especially the cheeseburger - one of the best in Phoenix.  The breakfasts,especially if you get there around sun up when you'll get to see all these scourilous knaves in their natural habitat, sipping coffee, wolfing lumberjack specials even Denny's would envy, are the total shit! I typically get a bowl of cream of wheat and a couple poached eggs. It comes to nine bucks with coffee and the tip. A little pricey but not when you consider you're smack dab in the middle of a cornucopia of societal throwbacks. Well worth it.   I love going to Kay's.  Listening in on the conversations.  Wondering just how it is Phoenix managed to adopt a little piece of Appalachia in its own backyard. And being a part of a contra culture Jeff Foxworthy would drool over.  Note: I should probably mention the owners are nicest folks you'll ever meet and, there are a lot of police in here too. Police must identify with rednecks I suppose.  One more thing. Since I gave you the tip on Kay's, I expect to be included in your footnotes.

I've been going to this restaurant since I was a student at nearby West High School. It remains my favorite Mexican food in Phoenix to this day. The recipes are great, food is always consistent and the ownership has remained in the family since inception. I just wish I could talk the owners into opening in North Scottsdale...it takes me an hour to drive there, but worth the drive.

There's something to be said for consistency.  Like how the owner is always standing at the checkout counter, scouring the stock section of the newspaper...grumbling to himself. How the same lady server has worked there for all of the twenty or so years I've been going there.  And how the food never varies. The same dozen or so featured items week after week, year after year.   Sometimes you need that. The feeling that while the rest of the world is changing at breakneck speed, there's a respite from all of it.  A place where you know you can always go where the food, the people, the ambiance will always be the same. Its small intimate surroundings. The server, who upon seeing me knows to bring me a diet coke and does so before I seat myself.  And the warm smiles from the owners when I leave.  Be forewarned however. It's not fancy. Its very small, and can get crowded at lunch and dinner. But the food will always be the same, guaranteed.  This place is pure comfort.

This is mainly a rant on the City of Phoenix aviation department and PanAm Flight Academy, not ATC. If you're a pilot, you're going to love this.   Actual conversation while attempting to land at Deer Valley Airport  Tower: 3juliet bravo, make left downwind for two-five-right, you're second behind the Piper twin, he's short-fielding on two-five-left.  Me: Uh, DV Tower, I think you might have a problem with the piper...he seems to be extending.   Tower to Piper: PanAm23, why are you extending?  PanAm23: Deal Va..rrey Tow.ell... uh,  prease..leepeet.   After putting down, I ask the guys at the Atlantic FBO what's with all the Asian pilots, since this seems to be an everyday event.  They tell me PanAm, the other flight academy at DV, in a shameless quest to improve enrollment, imported a few dozen students directly from China. It's like this every day. So now, instead of the tower conducting normal instructions, they're now busy teaching English to kids from China.  Tower: PanAm23, please do not extend, REPEAT, DO NOT EXTEND! please begin your turn, you're approved for short field on two-five-left. DO YOU COPY???  PanAm: ok..ten foal. As he continues to extend....  Tower to me: JulietBravo, you wanna make short field on two-five-right?  Me: Lodger that [giggling into open mic]  Thanks PanAm

Hi. My name is Saul.  I'm a taste bud and my story is a sad one.   I don't know how old I am or how I came to be, I only know my lot in life is to sit around waiting for my host, some dick named Diego, to stuff weird tasting shit into his mouth and sample it for him. It's awful. Mainly because our asshole host likes to try new foods...as if we, (all five-thousand of us) are lab rats he routinely uses to conduct his Dr. Frankenstein-like foodie experiments on.   Anyway, here's the drill.  He stuffs something rude into mouth expecting us to taste it, give a full report to brain, then sit idly by waiting for mouth to receive its orders. The results? It goes one of two ways. Mouth either spits it out or swallows it.   At first blush, as a taste bud this may not sound like such a bad life, especially when sweet tooth is on the job, but if your host is Diego, well, you're pretty much fucked because sweet tooth has been overridden by brain after their reading something  called South Beach diet.  Normally, and under most circumstances, things wouldn't be so bad if he'd just behave like other humans, simply taking a small taste of something and reacting like everyone else who'd just tasted some incredibly spicy food.... jumping out of their chair screaming;        "HOLY FUCK IS THAT HOT, GET ME SOME ICE WATER...STAT!!!!"  But he doesn't. No, instead, this asshole likes to show off and in the process, punish us, right along with mouth and anus. And for what? So he can prove how macho he is? As I said, the guy's a dick.  Well, fuck him.  I've got a news flash. If he keeps up the kind of shit he did yesterday, taking us to Las Cazuelas and repeatedly burning us with their hot-as-hell hot sauce...willfully disregarding our warnings to brain to spit the shit out post-haste or else stomach and anus will be some hurting-ass units tomorrow, he's in for a big surprise.  The next time he smokes some of that bad-ass chronic when his wife's out of town, gets a severe case of munchies, and relies on me and my buds to inform brain how some of the stuff he's eating has been sitting in the fridge for weeks and is now rancid, well, maybe we'll just conveniently 'forget' to notify brain of our findings.  We'll give him, right along with stomach, anus, brain, and gag reflex something to think about the next time he even thinks about taking us to Las Cazuelas.   Think you're the macho shit Diego? We've got news for you dickhead. Just you wait.   Note: Their food IS magnificent. Especially the machaca. But as a taste bud, I can't recommend the hot sauce. I haven't spoken to anus yet this morning, but I'm fairly certain he won't be recommending it either.

Sonoran style Mexican food fit for a drug cartel kingpin!   Pre-dinner chips and salsa are deliciously different. Unlike other chain joints, here, the chips will remind you of your last trip to Sinaloa; thick cut and deep fried to dark brown perfection, not the lightly golden chips served at most chains.  Salsas are unique too. A red and a green with surprisingly good (and different) flavors. At some point, I started mainlining the green with a spoon as my wife looked on in horror.  My spouse ordered some kind of combination dinner plate, number something or other. Who the fuck knows. I never listen, being much too focused on my own order and what delicious goodness awaits. I should have listened. My machaca plate was good, but hers, hers was the shit, causing me to break-out out the puppy dog eyes in hopes of a few mercy bites.    Another thing I'd like to point out; this isn't Scottsdale. It's Southwest Phoenix and not a great neighborhood either. Here's some cheap advice from someone who was born and raised in this hood:  If you come here, taking-in the experience much as a tourist visiting Mexico for the first time would, do yourself a favor. Don't look around all judgy at the wannabe fashionistas, and don't EVEN look anyone directly in the eye, particularly the men. There's always going to be some guy on a Friday night who's perro-borracho and all too willing to yell at you from the next table, solemnly inquiring as to just what the fuck your problem is. Your 'problem' is you're not Mexican. You're a gringo, affluent and sticking out like a teen dining at Golden Corral.   Affluence of any sort doesn't play here.  May I suggest jeans and a Tecate t-shirt for the gentleman?  For the lady, a pair of skin tight jeans, and a clingy, all-cotton stretch top. You might wish to suggest these makeup guidelines as well:    1. Pencil thin eyebrows, the apex nearly touching the hairline. (Use medium tip black Sharpy for best results)   2. Pacific blue eye shadow, covering the eyelids and extending well into the crow's feet. Go ahead, be generous.   3. Tons of eye liner, extending well into the temple area and finished with a nice curly cue.  4. A faux tatoo on the back of each finger. L-O-V-E on one, P-A-P-Y on the other.  Think of this event as dress-up night. A themed party with some great Mexican food.  It'll be an absolute hoot!  Note: As a consolation for making mama dress-up like Rosalita in 'Latina Sluts 7',  allow her to bring her Louie bag. No-one will have a clue what it is or how you paid their combined annual wages for it.

Chicken marinated and grilled to crispy skin perfection over an open flame. I love it. I love it so much I could marry it. Only if I did, we would never have kids since she'd be barren from all the flame grilling and marinating.  I'm not sure that's the life I envisioned as a young man.  I want a couple more kids, but not with a flame-broiled chicken.                                               i don't care how hot she is.   The pollo bowl is only five bucks...'bout a half of a breast, rice and beans in a six inch bowl. Quite a lot actually.  EIther get here at 11:30 or wait until after 1:30, when after the lunch crowd subsides.  Be prepared for panhandlers standing just outside the door asking for loose change. Such a great hood.  Enjoy.

The panhandling is out of control at this location.  While in the drive-thru, a bum, (or hobo, take your pick) will sneakily wait for you to roll down your window as you approach the speaker box. Then, before you can place your order, the asshole interrupts your well prepared sonnet about a number three and a diet coke asking for money. How fucked is that? This caused me to roll up my window, (like any good American) relying on my overly tinted windows to shield me from his view.  Unfettered by my sly window moves, he simply refused to shoo.  This caused me to roll down my window and bust-out my best Spanish where I warned him to move away from the vehicle. I even said it like a cop to scare him.  Sadly however, the only thing I know how to say in Spanish is "Cuanto de su hermana?" or loosely translated, "How much for your sister?" It worked. He probably thought I had the crazy or something...who knows.  Eight pieces of chicken will cost you ten bucks. It's pretty tasty stuff.  PS. I also know how to say "Esta mota es mierda" (This weed is shit)

Summer is coming. That might not mean much, but to women it means everything.  Like how they're going to stuff that size ten butt into a size four bikini in the next few months without looking like an overstuffed sausage.  Well, here's some bad news for all you hungry girls. You have no chance of losing anything (maybe your boyfriend or husband) if you come here with any regularity.   Remember the name of the place? Texas Roadhouse? Well these folks take pride in serving 'Texas' sized meals. Which for the normal person should put them about two meals ahead of their eating schedule.   Service was friendly and fast. Food was superb. And judging by the looks of the women in this place, they have no clue we'll be in triple digits in about 90 days, relegating them to a nice big onesy at the pool  this summer.  Nice job TR. I enjoyed my pulled pork. Fried pickles, salad, and bucket 'o peanuts.  I thank you. Lowes Home Improvement center does not however, as I went next door after lunch and farted my way through every aisle, crop dusting as if I was a  former WWll pilot.

Everyone farts.  The question is whether the meal was worth the aftermath.  If it's Mexican, without question. Every fart I can pump out after a #4 at Macayo's is like Babe Ruth at bat - I knock each and every one right out of the park! And I don't even mind.  But milk? Yeah, I don't know. Sometime's it's just not worth the effort. And I know a lot of people who feel this way - claiming to be lactose intolerant when they're really not. They've just never cozied-up to the idea of pumping hot growlers when the meal was only Count Chocula and not a delicious plate stacked with enchiladas.  But let's say you're not truly lactose intolerant but really more farting intolerant, have I got good news for you Danzeisen Dairy.  Danzeisen's milk doesn't sit in a stainless steel tank at UDA (United Dairymen of Arizona) for god knows how long before getting shipped off to market. Their milk, unlike even the best 'organic' milks are by far fresher tasting and longer lasting - three weeks to a month under normal conditions.  And here's the best part. It won't make you fart. I have proof.  I drank a quart of strawberry, and half quart of orange the other day at work and all I could muster was a little tiny chick fart - like that one at the end of Jeff Daniel's bathroom scene in Dumb and Dumber - and I didn't even have to! I just sort of pushed it out just, well, because, that's what I do.   The milk, produced daily at 3 am, is on your grocer's shelf that same day. Their market is small; AJ's Fine Foods, Whole Foods, and Safeway, and there's the bottle deposit to contend with, but overall, you'll be glad you tried it.  If you're a milk drinker but in recent years found yourself straying due to the unpleasantness of gagging yourself for no apparently good reason, that all ends now.  Danzeisen Milk- worth each and every little mildy warm squeaker your system can muster.

It's the only possible explanation for this place. Why would anyone spend ten minutes looking for a parking spot a half mile away, stand in line for forty-five minutes among a gaggle of droopy-eyed young people whose faces are wearing the previous night's story, only to have the effort rewarded with extremely slow service and mediocre food?  I think it's called "misery loves company."  Well I'm pretty miserable most mornings, but I don't feel the need to make my miserable worse by standing in a line gawking at others equally as miserable, eating food that's miserable, and becoming even more miserable after my server, who I think may be related to David Copperfield, mysteriously vanishes, only to reappear with a smile and a check.   Here's a tip Breakfast Club. Hangovers require water. Lots and lots of water.

It's a new year. And in Scottsdale Arizona that can only mean one thing. Old, fat, white guys from all over the country will soon be making their annual pilgrimage here for what can only be hailed as the ultimate testosterone-fueled event of the season; The Barrett Jackson Classic Car Auction.  You've heard the term 'fat-cats' before? Well now's your chance to see what one looks like up close and in person as they dazzle with their unique brand of  elitist douchebaggery. What do these 'fat-cats' look like you ask? You'll know them when you see them, they're easy to spot.   Typically, they're fat, old and white, (pasty white to be more specific), wearing Hawaiian print shirts, Chevrolet ball caps, and usually with a dizzy blonde in tow...one who's tripping balls on vodka, red bull and Xanax. And yes, they'll be the ones engaging anyone who threatens to even mildly imply they might have a little more scratch than they do by outbidding them, squashing their childhood dreams of owning that IROC Z-28 Camaro by not just a few thousand dollars, but more like a few million.   Folks, this is classic American debauchery at its finest as this cunning breed of socialite uses a classic-car auction to prove to the Barbie-esque dumb-fuck on his elbow how he's actually six feet tall, hung like a pack mule, and sporting a third nut.   Seriously, it's a fun event if you don't get outbid for that '64 Impala by some big fat drunk fucker whose girlfriend is egging him on. Almost like a fermented Dallas Cowboy's cheerleader, circa 1980.  I hate my life. I can't even own a fucking '64 Impala.  I wish I was Rambo.

You know how your wife or girlfriend is always whining about how you never listen to them? This of course as a shoe comes whistling past your cranium. Well The Tortilla Factory must have the same listening skills....their management never listens either.  You would think that after 111 reviews, someone over there would recognize there's a problem with the service.  Nope. This would lead one to conclude no-one in management knows about Yelp, or, and I suspect this is more the case, they can't read,  Prior to writing this, I read some of those 111 reviews in an effort to see how my experience last night paired-up. Uncannily, it was true to form, explaining why this place gets two and a half stars.  Service was bad with waiters only stopping by to sell more drinks. Had to ask for the tortillas twice before ever seeing them..appx 20 minutes waiting on the free tortillas. Hey TF, do I need to remind you of your namesake???  And the prices for the amazingly tasteless food will stupefy you. (I sampled everyone's food in our party of eight)   Old Town Tortilla Factory...you're really one sneaky bastard. Laying in wait....for all the unsuspecting Scottsdale visitors looking for the 'Mexican Food' experience, and instead ambushing them with your bad service, high prices and tasteless garbage you call food.  But you do have some nice attributes, which is why, similar to my situation of never listening, I still have a wife. Only I'm not sure how a fountain, large patio and a cutesy margarita cup are going to keep you in business. Oh well, who cares...right? There'll be another plane full of visitors headed your way tomorrow.   Are you related to Rustlers Roost by any chance?  You both have so much in common.

I don't eat at RL much, opting for smaller boutique cookeries in lieu of the big chain restaurants, so i was pleasantly surprised last night at my dining experience here. The greeter was friendly, the service was above average and the food, while only a little above average, was nonetheless quite good.  And that's what surprises me. RL has a good business model for a chain and has obviously had years to perfect it.  I couldn't help but compare it to some of the swankier seafood joints in Scottsdale, thinking, "same quality, half the price". In these troubled economic times, austerity is king and as such, RL gets my vote.

This is a real nice place to hold an event, just not a beer festival.  With its four, yes, count them,four urinals in the men's room, this is not exactly the place you want to be during a five hour drinking event.  I felt like a little kid, standing there, legs crossed with one hand on crotch squeezing, grimacing. Not really, but I couldn't concentrate on anything that was being spoken since I had to pee so badly. Another good life experience is what I chalked it up to.  I've always wanted to test the limits of my bladder, similarly to one of those astronauts in that movie 'The Right Stuff'.  The Winter Beer Festival was just ok. I met a girl who had the most perfect eyebrows I've ever seen. She said they were natural but I don't believe her. They were too perfect. (I'm not gay, but supportive) I drank some Habanero IPA and burned my throat. The band was good.  Venue should offer Frito Lay products instead of Jay's brand potato chips.  I really could have really used a bag a Cheetos or sour cream and green onion Doritos. A ride home would have been nice too. I woke up in a parking lot.

I never intend to, but somehow, each year I manage to ruin major holidays by gorging all the See's Candies before anyone in the family ever gets to sample any.  At first I'm all, "I think I'll skip breakfast today and have one with my coffee." Then another, and another, and after a while, I'm like, "Aw, fuck it."   I don't know what happens, but once I eat one of See's 'Nuts and Chews', I lose my motherfucking mind, slipping into an eating frenzy so pronounced I practically want to devour the box.  Anyway, they cost a small fortune but are worth every penny.  I bought a one-pound and a two-pound box a couple days ago, the price tag was fifty three bucks.  If you do the math, that works out to just under 4 cents a gram, which compared with coke at $40  a gram, is quite the deal.   If you have an addictive personality, you may want to glom onto this See's thing. Just up your workout regimen a tad and load up. Try about a dozen with a couple of Monsters first thing in the morning and get ready to kick some boo-tay at work. At least for a couple hours anyway.

Lots to love here.  Food, service, decor, ambiance...all blue ribbon. Even better yet, the crowd.  It was a sunday night and the place was packed, so we opted for the bar. After a tour of the bar, realizing there was no seating available, we headed for the door.  That's when a server stopped me, informing us how there was a couple who offered to share their high-top with us.  We took them up on their offer and had no regrets. They were a fun couple with whom we had drinks, dinner and lively conversation.  The macaroni and cheese is delicious, and no, I'm not eight years-old. Also, try the 'big ass hamburger'. As self described, it's a beautiful burger that even Kim Kardashian's ass can't hold a candle to.   Another treat is the chips with guacamole and cheese. Great to go along with cocktails.  You'll enjoy being here, especially in the bar where there are a number of good looking people, most of whom will sleep with you in trade for your fake Rolex.

The name Roaring Fork is a misnomer.  My fork never actually roared, but he did kick up quite a ruckus.  At the beginning of the meal, he just laid there idle next to spoon, knife, and little brother; 'roaring' salad fork....not a peep out of the four of them.  I think he was plotting his sinister moves on my entree while watching me wolf the bread basket and chef's free appetizer, his presence not required.  But then dinner arrived and it was showtime. He busted out.  Viciously attacking our Waldorf chicken salad, he literally left me breathless. I was like Michael Phelps, sipping what little amount of air I could gather between bites. It all happened so fast. The entire meal a blur.  Two Waldorf chicken salads and two waters came to forty-two bucks, fifty with the tip.  But to see that little bastard in action was well worth the price of admission, even though he did remain conspicuously silent throughout his little shit-show.  I think he might be related to Michigan Frog....only roaring for the owner or something.

I love chile peppers. Especially Asian chile peppers. I don't like them the next day, as my bum re-enacts the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, but the taste of a fabulous chile is too compelling for me not to eat.  This is the single most reason to eat here. The flavors. They are, simply remarkable.  Your server will offer a spice level between one and seven. Anything beyond three or four and you won't be able to taste the food. Anything around seven and you'll be begging your doctor for a sphincter transplant the following day.  If you're inclined to eat hot food, always pushing the limit, looking for something to make you cry, go for the ten. Only three things ever made me cry as an adult. My father, who beat me like a rented mule the time I wrecked his pickup. My massage therapist, Eduardo, who thinks I'm in the running for a job with Cirque du Solei. And Malee's Thai Bistro

I just got home. I can't move. Breathing, labored. I think my water just broke. Shit. I'm not a woman.   Malees. Where sport-eating rules.  Note: Tom Ka Gai soup. Singha beers  Evil Jungle Princess...too much food for two people.

Dinner was perfect. Everything was perfect, except for one thing. The older woman seated at the next table.  Girls, let me ask you a question. Do you really think wearing a beautiful pair of open-toed shoes negates a bad case of hammertoes accentuated by a mildly bad case of nail fungus? Why on earth wouldn't you at least paint your toenails to hide such an affliction?  That shit's just whack, seriously.   My entire dinner was spent ogling this lady's toes. They grossed-me out that badly.  At one point, my wife finally quipped;              "What is so damned important that you keep looking at the next table?"  I hate to be a judgy mcjudgerson, but I couldn't help but wonder what was going on in that woman's head when she was strapping on her shoes, in preparation for dinner.      "I think I'll wear my Jimmy Choos tonight.  I love my Jimmy Choos, everyone will       love my Jimmy Choos."  Not everyone bitch.

Green peppercorn shrimp and calamari has got to be the house joke. Three tiny shrimp, not even measuring an inch in diameter, along with rings of Calamari so minuscule they resembled small rubber bands. Not kidding. Why, half the fun of eating calamari is grossing your friends out by hanging all the tentacles halfway out of your mouth - then sucking them back in - in a mighty swoosh.  Major disappointment, no swooshing.  Malee's.  If you think your fabulous sauces are going to wow me, getting me to overlook how  you just cheated me out of fifteen bucks, you're wrong.   I don't like gnawing on lemongrass sticks either. Leave them out. They do nothing for the presentation, save for tricking your average Thai food novice into taking a bite.  This would be like an American restaurant leaving bay leaves in everything and having Thai people thinking its something you eat.  Shame on you.   I didn't like the Spinach Chicken either. Same chicken base and sauce as is in many of the other chicken dishes, only it's ladled over fresh, uncooked spinach leaves.  You couldn't have put less effort into this dish if you tried.  This is the Vanna White of Thai dishes.  Maybe this is how you survive the summer months when the tourists are gone.  I'm out.

Makin it rain on the ho's used to be your job.  Well not anymore. You're not makin it rain on shit these days. But let's just say you were going to make it rain on your bitches again, you'd need to look good while doing so and Nieman is where you'd go to get outfitted.   You could go a cheaper route, but this is a rookie-rainmaker mistake.  For example, the novice rainmaker might cut fashion corners, shopping at T.J. Maxx or the like. Not good. This goes against the entire rainmaking principle.  A real rainmaker doesn't cut fashion corners, mainly because he knows his bitches can smell cheap a mile away.  This is why the true rainmaker will only come here.   Start in the men's department and get yourself a Zegna suit.  Now the shoe department for some Ferragamo's. You'll need some silk briefs too. No boxers.  And a robe, preferably silk, to look cool in bed.   The whole thing should cost you a couple stacks, so be prepared to bring your wife's credit card..the one with the high limit.  If you do this right, you'll come out of there looking just like Willie the Wimp did when they buried him in that Cadillac coffin.  Now just wait for this week's unemployment check to arrive and you'll be makin it rain once again. Feels good, huh?

Big stars for Frank and Lupe not banning me for life.  After knocking not one but three drinks on the ground, all three producing shards of broken Negro Modelo glass, one would think they'd send a goon squad over to whisk my Winter Beer Festival attending ass out the door, throwing me into the street like the town drunk in some old western movie.  Nope. What did they do? Instead, they bring me replacement drinks free of charge. Go figure. Like I needed any more beer, right?  I suggest ordering the #4 combination dinner. I managed to get a couple bites, (which was pretty damned tasty) but most of it wound up on my white polo shirt. Weird how white attracts large amounts of Mexican food. I looked like an art-deco work in progress.   Frank and Lupe, you have a really nice establishment.  Your food (what I can remember of it) is tasty, and your servers are super polite, but you really should have banned me for life, or at the very least, called the police on me or something.  Anyways, I'm going to do you guys a big favor and self-impose a "Banned-for-life" on me.  It's the least I can do to return the favor.   BTW, we were both lucky I found your receipt in my cargo shorts this morning, otherwise I'd never know the name of the place to ban myself from.

On the disappointment scale, Italian Grotto ranks right up there with my never getting laid by my first girlfriend, whom I now know twenty years later is a lesbian.  Three entrees and I sampled all of them. The marinara dipping sauce was heavy with tomato paste and not at all a good marinara.  The clams swam in a broth so salty, it made my lips swell up like a pontoon boat. The fried calamari and artichoke were fried to a delicious, white coloration which, in the realm of fried foods, was about fourteen hues down from golden brown. This created confusion in my already befuddled mind. Was it cooked or wasn't it?  I Had to take a bite to solve the mystery. Unnerving.  I ordered an antipasto for two thinking I'd go light with meats, cheese, and relishes. Another huge disappointment. It looked like a salad with two buried slices of capicolla deep within and two, also buried, slices of salami. The remainder of the bowl was small bits of red and yellow peppers, about thirty pepperoncini, but mostly romaine tops. This was anything but a traditional antipasto, with the majority of the bowl comprised of lettuce. I don't know why IG hides the meat and cheese, but it pissed me off.  I felt like the catcher in a game of hide the salami. Literally!  I had to ask for bread since the antipasto was a bust. This made me feel like Oliver Twist begging for crumbs, and for no good reason at $12.95. The only thing good about this place was nothing.   I suspect they've remained in business all these years primarily due to their location, and all the unknowing tourists.  Never going back.

In a bad marriage? Thinking about having an affair with the new girl in accounting,..the one who's been eyeballing you as if she's practically undressing you whenever you go to the copy room?  Well think no more. It's time for action. March on down to accounting, ask her (I think her name's Margaret)  to lunch and take her to the Village Tavern. The perfect place to conduct your sordid activities.  Where the lighting is dark. The booths are walled and semi private. And the salads taste as if Aphrodite herself is in the kitchen, lovingly assembling them. They even put a cute little mini muffin on the side. I think it's carrot or zuchini...something I don't eat but is nonetheless good.  Margaret from accounting will love you for it.  I don't eat bunny food, so the salads hold no appeal for me.  I eat meat, and lots of it.  Which is why I order the prime rib.   I do this with good reason.  Just in case Margaret doesn't want to venture next door, holed-up for the afternoon in the Gainey Ranch Hotel, I will have at least gotten my fill of something tender and delicious at a reasonable price.   If you're not having an affair, I highly recommend this place to you as well.  Mainly in hopes the place will fill up with people I don't know, so that bitch friend of my wife's, Mindy Hirschberg doesn't get a table,   Because one thing is certain, if Mindy gets a table and sees me and Margaret  (from accounting) cooing in the next booth, she'll rat me out in a heartbeat. Probably for eating red meat as well.  What a bitch.   Try this place, you won't be disappointed.  Margaret probably will be however, but not from the food or service, mainly your lack of performance due to eating such a heavy lunch.

They recently added patio seating for overflow crowds. Great. The patio is right next to the main drive and parking area.  There's no hiding from headlights. I duck down every time a car pulls into the parking lot. It's like I'm bobbing for apples. I'm sick of ducking. The next car, I push Margaret's head down below the table. She thinks I do it for a different reason and gets mad. I'm breaking up with her. I hope her dad doesn't fire me. Not cool VT. Losing a star.

Good news for all you bulimics! This food is so rich, it'll come right back up just as quick as it went down - and with no finger-coaxing!  I told my wife I was sick, but she never listens (kinda like me).  Anyway, we rounded out restaurant week here with a 12 oz. ribeye, some creamed spinach, and tempura battered onion rings. All of it was damned tasty, even on a sick stomach.  Sadly, for anyone leaving after us, they would have had to negotiate my dinner on the sidewalk in front of the elevator.  Also, my wife, whose shoes got caught by some wayward spinach splash, was pretty bummed, although I'm not sure why. I can't figure out if it was her ruined shoes, or if she was upset we just spent 170 bucks and half of it wound up on a sidewalk.  Anyways, my sincere apologies to management, and, the poor shite who had to clean up the mess.

Sushi grade Ahi served on a 500 degree block of Himalayan sea salt. A lone short rib, cubed, perched atop a bed of braised root vegetables. So majestic looking, it reminded me of a sentinel on lookout. A hangar steak (flank) cooked to perfection.  All three shared two common themes: Both the presentation and sodium levels were immeasurable.  I love Lon's. I want to show them off to my friends from out of town.  I love their wine cellar...it's dungeon-esque type features. I want to eat there on special occasions because I know I won't be disappointed. But this trip had me rethinking everything I know about Lon's and that's saying something since I've been going there for many years now.  The gravy on the hangar steak was inedible it was so salty. My girls secretly wiped it all away so as not to create a stir with our server, knowing I would send it all back and give him a couple of what-fers in the process. My short rib was braised perfectly, however, it was dry and lean. Not what I was hoping for. And the pre-dinner bread basket had the most delicious looking chips, also inedible due to the extreme salt content.  Stay out of the bar. I ordered a Crown Royal Manhattan. I was informed they don't serve Crown Royal, but some bullshit well whiskey called Buffalo Trace. Seriously, who doesn't serve Crown? I expected Lon's to serve Crown Black for Christ's sakes. My wife ordered a Mai Tai. It was undrinkable.  Lon's, here's some advice from the cheap seats. Stop believing your own press clippings and take a long hard look in the mirror.  At the very least, hire an executive chef whose cravings for salt doesn't rival a 14th century sailor sporting a goiter the size of a basketball.

Some people need to have the 'freshest fish possible' in order to give a sushi joint a high rating.  Others need ambiance, an overly animated sushi chef, or great service. I need none of those at a sushi restaurant.  i need a generous supply of booze on the cheap so I'm able to wash down this gelatinous shit while attempting a faux smile, indicating to my date who suggested we go here in the first place, how I'm thoroughly enjoying the experience.  I'm not. But she'll never know that.  What I am enjoying however is the Japanese beer served in two-liter bottles.  The sake, which I occasionally bomb my brew with. And the waitress, who reminds me of one of those giggling little dolts featured on Iron Chef.  Try this. Inquire about anything on the menu, purposely mispronouncing it, or at the very least, using the inflection of a redneck.  Then sit back and watch her giggle, like one of those cutesy asian judges who'd just tried one of Bobby Flay's odder-than-owl-shit creations.  Its adorable.  Only because this is Yelp will I suggest a dish. The tuna tempura roll.  Again, not because I like raw fish, but rather how it's served with hot sauce which when combined with their freshly ground wasabi, some ginger, soy sauce and a gulp of beer, will actually produce a nice little taste-bud orgasm.

When these guys told us our dog had cancer, I couldn't believe it. We were going to lose the little guy once and for all, I chuckled to myself.  Then the really bad news. They wanted a god-awful amount of money to put him down.  We discussed it at dinner that evening with friends, who generously offered an alternative knowing we were short on money.  They'd take him to their ranch in WIckenburg, and in a ceremonial 'last fetch' Cindy would throw his favorite chew toy out into the desert one last time while Ed peppered him with his varmint rifle.  This rather than lay on a cold stainless steel table and go out like a death-row inmate getting a lethal injection!  A pretty good plan I thought, considering he actually deserved both methods for twice shitting on my pillow in the last month.  My wife disagreed and the conversation was over.  Instead, we, or rather I, had to endure another three months of this little shitzdoodle or whatever the hell he was, crapping in his dinner bowl, ruining our oriental rugs, and once more crapping on my pillow before she finally threw in the towel and took him to DC Ranch Animal Hospital.  Here's some cheap advice.  If your vet tells you your dog has cancer, pull the plug on him right then and there.   Say a few words, give him his last rites, pay the fee, cough up another sixty five bucks for the cremation cost and get it over with. Trust me, it'll be worth it.

I come here to talk shit in Italian with Sal, one of the barbers. And - get a haircut. And - watch the ever liberal CNN news.  [CNN reporter]   "Apparently, the captain was the first off the ship as it began sinking, now back to you Wolf."  Me: What kind of a chicken shit puddle of piss is this guy - who does that?   Sal:  What'dya meana  who doesa that? He wasa goin fora help. He goana coma righta back.  Me: Ok, Sal, he was going for help. Right.  Sal: Ah, va fanicoula (stick it up yer ass)  Me: Mangia merde e morte  (eat shit n die)  This place is one of the last bastions of Italian manhood I know. I love Sal. I hope he lives to a hundred. He really screwed me over today with these bangs.  Want a great haircut? Come here and see Rosario, Guiseppe or Sal.  Don't engage them in Italian unless you want to look like Moe from the three stooges.

According to Dr. Oz, one in three women over the age of forty suffers from constipation.  Well if you're one of those unlucky three, have I got good news for you! Mandarin Buffet (formerly King).  The buffet selection is huge, and the items all look tasty as they beckon you with their siren song. And this is how you'll fix those bloated bowels once and for good.  Try everything.   Yes, a little smattering of every item will guarantee your greasing-off heaters again in no time. For me, that was about an hour.  But hey, everyone's different. I process food slower than most, so I may be the anomaly here.  You just may find you'll blow-up THEIR bathroom, instead of the office restroom, which in retrospect would have been a whole lot less humiliating.  I'm not certain what got me deucing so badly, but I think it was the pink stuff that looked like chicken and tasted like anything but.  Maybe it was pork, I'm not sure but again, try everything to be safe.  You're bound to get a case of the trots and by doing so,  get those bowels working again like a washing machine on its spin cycle, instead of those lazy as mud city workers...you know, with five guys standing around on a street corner looking down a hole in the pavement.  I gave King stars because I've been off my crapping game lately (like you care)  and this one little sojourn got me right back on track.  Pretty cool, huh?

I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night. Service was excellent, and highly attentive. Food, absolutely horrible.  My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye.  What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered.  What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style.  Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick Filet Veggies, blah. Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh.   In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English.   I've had it with this place. If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle

One of life's greatest pleasures is revenge, and I can't think of a better place to dish it up than at Defalco's.  Here's how.  It's Saturday and the girls are looking for a place to lunch. Recommend Defalco's, explaining how their sandwiches are off the hook.  When you get there, hang back and order last. It's a small place with nowhere to loiter once you've ordered, the girls will be forced to a table.  Now the revenge. You recommended the Italian sub to the others, saying how the portions are super small and to order the whole instead of the half. They believe you and order.   Only now, as none of them are within earshot, having wandered off to their table, you order a small cup of mixed olives, a plate of Italian cheeses, and a glass of Chianti. So very European! You won't find this anywhere on the menu, but Defalco's will make it for you special..it'll cost around 10 bucks.   Go take your seat with the girls and wait, as the server tries to squeeze three subs the size of Shaq's sneakers onto the table...right along side your tiny plate of cheese and olives.  They're mortified.  Staring at their 'subs' as all the hot ASU guys in this place are now staring at them. This, as you daintily pick up an olive, a small piece of cheese and take a sip of chianti while smiling at the hotties.  Now enjoy, as your bitch 'friends' pay for that remark you overheard them make at Jessica's bachelorette party last weekend...the one about how your butt resembles Oprah's on steroids.  Have another sip of wine sweetie. Beautiful, isn't it?

It's every man's worst nightmare....the 'C' word.  No, not cancer...cancer would actually be better than this. I'm talking colonoscopy.  I'm retracing my steps, thinking back on what may have lent to this predicament, but honestly, the answers elude me. But thank god for my doctor, whom upon my awakening from the procedure, dutifully informed me that in no point during the procedure did she spot my head.  Nope, it was still attached to my neck and now, I have her to validate this long-running debate.  The results?  Good news, as my wife stood bedside listening to the disappointing prognosis. (I think she lost a bet with her bitch friend, Mindy).  Note: The gallon of fruit punch ex-lax you drink the night before washes down good with Stoly. At least the first one does. Anything after that's a waste of good vodka.

The best Indian I ever had was this Navajo babe, whose name translated "Spreads like butter."  The second best Indian, food that is, was here at Delhi Palace. Well, not really, it was in London, but who cares, that's like five thousand miles away. If you live in Phoenix, or visit here often, and you like Indian, (dots, not feathers) you'll want to go here.  Here's why.  The place is crawling with Indians, and that's a good sign considering most Indian joints are littered with white people. And everyone knows white people cant tell the difference between a good curry and cold-boiled mule.  Secondly, all the Caucasians flock to Applebees or Olive Garden on a typical weekend night, evidence of which is a line of people standing outside waiting for hours to be seated. I don't like to wait.  I also don't like making reservations.  That's where Delhi Palace excels in my book.  I never have to wait on a weekend night since the only people eating there are Indians and me.   The palak paneer is great. Lamb vindaloo superb. Tandoori oven cooked foods aren't dry and overcooked.  They also make a good Mango Lassi.  I like this place.  Even that singy-songy shit they call Indian music blaring from the sound system, which typically makes me irritable halfway through the meal.  For some reason I like their music, but it's still weird.

When rating Indian Cuisine, I tend to rate it based on a bowel-evacuation scale I developed years ago. For example, a normal movement would warrant little or no Indian-food respect, subsequently, no stars. On the other hand..  There's the Cleveland Trembler; a violent ass-quake followed by a shit-tsunami only a large (and very sick) farm animal is capable of. The Trembler gets a full five stars.  Well, where is Dehli in the whole scheme of things? So glad you asked. Dehli has never made the Trembler, but it IS darned close.  The baingan bharta prepared to spice level eleven will send yer IBS straight into overdrive. In fact, all their dishes prepared to eleven will pretty much fuck you up for a good day or so.  If I'm in the mood for Indian, I typically visit Delhi on Saturday night, this so I have an excuse to get out of Sunday Costco and all that other husband/father shit expected of me on my only day off.  Why? Because even a day off with the shits is better than a day off fixing stuff around the house, shopping, or the all-too-familiar query:      "Is that all you're going to do today? Lay around on that damned couch?"         I

How often does this happen? You're driving down the road, cell in hand, Big Gulp and Whopper in the other as you attempt to eat your lunch while performing a juggling act. Then, when you least expect it, Pandora starts playing some bullshit by Whitesnake. You selected AC/DC radio -where the fuck did Whitesnake come from? You hate Whitesnake.  You just added another ball to your already legendary lunch/cell/driving juggling act. You're not letting go of the Whopper and its flame-broiled goodness. Putting the cell phone down could end your marriage since she's in the middle of ripping your ass for breaking another house rule. (toilet seat, missing garbage day, whatever) And now, some idiotic big-hair band from the 80's is intruding on your lunch.  You've got to switch stations stat, but how?  You're already steering with both knees, you can't take your eyes off the road, and the smell of that flame-broiled Whopper is too much to bear as you take another bite. What do you do?  You Helen Keller it - searching for the tuner knob to turn off the Whitesnake. Uh-oh. You just grabbed the wrong knob, switching your transmission into four-wheel drive low range, and at forty miles an hour no less.  You've got some new decisions now. You can either go to Power Ford, who will want $3,800 to install a rebuilt transmission. Or... You can go to Adolph's, where you'll spend $2,300.   Next time, don't answer the cell phone if the caller ID comes up "Superfreak",  enjoy the Whopper, and power through Whitesnake for the next three minutes.  You'll be glad you did.

Similar to how one might spend his entire summer building a resistance to Iocane powder, I've spent the last few years building my resistance to tequila and Dos Equis, Well I'm happy to report how all of my resistance training paid-off yesterday at Harold's.  The ultimate challenge.  Cinco de Stinko and, The Kentucky Derby all rolled into one day-drinking event.  Five stars for our server, who could 'make or break' such an event. She was young, pleasant and attentive, making sure we had fresh soldiers upon her noticing our half-empty bottles. Now that's attentive.   We dedicated the first half of the day to Kentucky, drinking only Maker's Mark, washing it down with beer, and cursing the Duke NCAA basketball coach for losing in the first round of this year's March Madness tournament. Fucker.   Anyway, the place was packed. Lots of forty something babes with bonnets and old dudes in tow. But after a couple of Mint Juleps, the old-dudes were going down like Sasha Gray. Then it got fun, watching as the bonnet brigade checked us outt....their 'dates' slumped in their chairs.  The betting lines were long, but that worked in our favor. By astutely spying the end of the line for a group of fun-loving babes, whose old-dude escort was too weak to mess us up, we picked that moment get into the very long line.  Before long, we were buying shots for the girls. Laughing till we snorted. Trying on their bonnets, and encouraging them to dance. Fun for a while, but now it was time to turn our attention to Cinco. The race run.  This is where all the training paid off.  Drinking only tequila and Dos Equis, smack-talking the white babes in Spanish,  and now, trying to hustle weed from the old hippie bikers, we managed to meet some really fun people. Some who even thought they were the shit, challenging us to a drinking duel. Dumbasses.  Nobody beats me in day-drinking.   I majored in Iocaine powder...remember? Anyhow, we prevailed. It was fun to see them go down in flames. Even more fun to see one of them throwing up over the patio rail.  But I got some nice pics on my Iphone and before too long, decided to call it a day.  I don't recall much after that. Only waking up in the parking lot in my Jeep, delighted to see how I had all my limbs, digits, and no sign of blood anywhere on my person.   Overall, it was a good day.  Thanks Harold's.  I don't know who helped me to the Jeep and tucked me in, but if it was one of your staff, special thanks to them.

Upon entering the restaurant and for the remainder of our visit, one thing became crystal clear; Alberto, (Owner) will do everything and anything humanly possible to insure your experience is a good one. The service was flawless.  The food? Well his bread is off the charts with its thick crust and chewy crumb. For that matter, so is his herb infused olive oil. The entrees on the other hand were just average or slightly above.   An antipasti will cost you twelve dollars, but I don't recommend ordering one since it's ridiculously small and not enough to share with two average sized adults. The house wine,  a chianti, was delicious and priced-right at six dollars a glass.  Both of us felt the entrees were overpriced, however, the service more than made up for it.  Alberto will be our 'go to' Italian restaurant, but only for special occasions due to it being so pricey.

If you ever find yourself deep in the bowels of lacka-nookie hell, have I got some good news.  The Buffalo Chip.  It's a widely known fact how most chicks dig cowboys....manly bastards they are.  One small problem.  You're not a cowboy, which is why you're knee-deep in the midst of a sex-draught.  Well let's change all that, shall we?  Get down to Saba's western wear in Scottsdale and pick yourself out a cowboy getup, making sure to get a pair of tight fitting Wranglers that'll telegraph your business.  Another problem. You're running a small business and not a major corporation. That's ok.  That's what the good lord made gym socks for. Roll one up, and stuff it inside your boxers.  Hmmm.  That's not going to get anyone's attention. Better roll the other one up too.   Ok, now you're ready.  Climb into that Range Rover and head down to the Buffalo Chip. Start with one of their $3.75, 16 oz drafts.  Follow it up with 12 more jes like it.  Now it's time to eat.  Order the bbq meal. A full pound of tasty meat with all the fixins for 11 bucks.  Showtime. Sit at one of the tables next to the fire pit where everyone can see you.  Next, begin wolfing your food as though you've been on a cattle drive for the last month and haven't eaten anything but jerky and corn nuts.  Don't come up for air.  Be angry. Get mad at that bbq...wolf it down man.  Quick, sop up those beans with your bread, making sure to slop it all over your mug.  Now wash it down with some hot coffee you threw an ice cube in when no-one was looking.  Drink the entire cup in one gulp. This will impress any onlookers. Now, lick your lips, wipe your face with your sleeve, and make some loud noise like ahhhhhh.   Then, start looking around to see if any of the beautiful women in this place are watching your shit-show, hoping at least one of them is about to slide off her seat.   Time to rope a filly, bud.   Uh-oh.  Burrrrpp.   I forgot.  You don't drink twelve beers at a time do you?  Quick, run for the bathroom to throw up before anyone sees you.  Shit. You forgot the socks. Hoist up the socks man. Too late. One just slid down your pant leg and into the well-lit dance floor for all to see.  Now the other too. Don't look back man, git to the crapper...fast.   God you're pathetic. But I will give you props for at least trying.  Now wipe that puke and beans off your mug, and head back to the Rover...it's high time you skidaddled outa this place. You don't belong here.  You never did.  The cowboy life jes ain't for you.   Jes mosey along now.  Go on...GIT!

You're seated. Within moments, a push cart wheels to your table, it's over-grinning driver sporting one of those big toothy smiles. Not speaking, he nods his head, implicitly saying; "You try Dim Sum?  What the fuck, right?  I don't know dog shit from apple butter about this type of food. Why not, I reason.  I load up anything that remotely appears to have beef peering through its doughy cocoon.  Some of it tasty. Some, not very. Who cares. This is an experiment in eating as far as I'm concerned.  The tray comes around on timed intervals (it seems), only, the second time, I lose track of my first-round selections. I needed a plan. Methodically, I started at one end of the cart, sampling one of everything. Five rounds later, I'd had enough. I spit half the shit out in my napkin. (Anthony Bourdain I'm not).  The stuff that WAS good, was really good. Only I forgot which pieces were repeaters.  This shit is really confusing for a Dim Sum novice.  The desserts were tasty too, but I can't tell you what I ate. It was sweet with a weird texture.  This was an exceptional experience I will repeat, but I'm going to have to be severely fucked-up before doing so.  Smiling cart driver, with all his head bobbing had me fantasizing I was a turn of the century railroad magnate, surrounded by my Coolie workers.

She whispers in your ear softly; "I need to get up early for work tomorrow, do you think you could ask your friends to leave?"  The beer's gone. By rights, they should have left hours ago.  What's keeping them here you begin to wonder.  It's not you or your half charming personality. And it's certainly not your wife either.  It's those seven boxes of Metro Pizza you over-ordered.  This shit is so good, no-one's going anywhere until they're all stuffed like blue ticks..unable to hold another drop!  This pizza is so delicious, it'll have you crooning 'Hey Compare' and 'Funiculi, Funicula' in your head, over and over again.  You're not Italian, but after eating this pizza, you'll think you were raised by a hairy upper-lipped mom and her four hairy upper-lipped sisters who routinely beat you iwith a wooden spoon for not keeping up on your cranking duties on days when they all came over to make homemade pasta.  Bitches.

Fried pickles? Seriously??   "Yep...we're sharing an order...you're going to love them."  This from my co-workers in our Las Vegas office. Commuting to Las Vegas three times a week for eight years was a grind. Memphis made it tolerable.  I reluctantly ate the fried pickles, dipping them into some kind of weird pink sauce. Fuck it, when in Rome, right?  I ate everything on the menu in those eight years. I even ate things not on the menu.  Like my own tongue, biting into the sneaky little fucker as it pretended it was the pulled pork. A regular occurrence here.  I hate using clches, so I'll simply say the brisket isn't to die for, but is worth sustaining a serious life-threatening injury...like maybe a gunshot wound or something.   It's just that good.

Valiantly braving Saturday afternoon crowds and, the hellish seventy-degree weather that is Phoenix winter, I fought the good fight to eat here today. It was worth all the fuss.  My visit began at their wait-tank next door, Pizzeria Drunko (placeholder, forgot the name) where in my short two-hour wait I was able to consume five beers and a half-glass of wine, whiling away the afternoon, lusting for the highly coveted Bianco Pie.  My reward was a platter of the brightest green and tastiest olives I've ever eaten, a salad fit for royalty, and a pizza so indescribably delicious, I simply can't find words.  And that's when it hit me.  I was in the magic kingdom of pizza.  I summoned the server immediately and ordered three more pies, ate one and took the remaining slices home where in the last sixteen hours, I managed to eat every last slice.   No-one in my family is waking up to cold pizza this morning.  You hear me?  No-one!   PS. The margherita with prosciutto was the best, followed by the fennel, the biancoverde with red sauce, and who knows what the first one was, I inhaled that one.

In biblical times, they used to sacrifice animals to God.  One thing.  They only seemed to sacrifice baby lambs and goats, never beef. For some reason beef was off limits, although I'm not sure why but I do have a theory.  I think it's because God never had one of Durant's boneless ribeyes cooked Pittsburgh style with a side of atomic horseradish, pre-dinner crudites served with roquefort dressing, and a nice garden salad with a baked potato. Had he done so, I'm pretty sure Catholics would have never had that silly rule about not eating meat on Fridays.   I'm guessing someone back in the day, probably Abraham, did sacrifice a cow to God at one point, but because Abraham was Jewish and didn't know how to make anything other than reservations, he grilled and served up one bad cut of beef to God. The result? God punishes Catholics and Hindus. Go figure.   Durant's won't punish you. Not like Abraham anyway.

It's highly likely, at least in my opinion, that any reviewer giving this place less than five stars, is probably best suited for taco bell or the like.  Five stars doesn't do this place justice. And If the Chef hasn't won a James Beard award yet, I'd be surprised.  Nice Job BC Food, ambiance, service....a triumph!

Five stars for the chef, The bartender, five more. And five for the mezuzah hanging next to the door.  No, I'm not Jewish But know of their ways. So as long as I'm here I'm out of harm's way.  So I drink your tequila all one hundred brands till you ask me to leave then mezuzah be damned.  I'm now in harm's way No mezuzah, unsafe. And what of St. Christopher who hangs from my neck? Well where was he only moments ago when I stood up too fast  and back down I did go?  So they pack up my pork and my chips and my bread to send me off packing where soon I'll find dread from tequila and pork, and guacamole with berries. And from this girl at the bar who I now know is married.  Barrio, I dedicate this plagiarized passage to your 120 brands of tequila.  Tequila, scorpion honey, harsh dew of the doglands, essence of Aztec, crema de cacti; tequila, oily and thermal like the sun in solution; tequila, liquid geometry of passion; Tequila, the buzzard god who copulates in mid-air with the ascending souls of dying virgins; tequila, firebug in the house of good taste; O tequila, savage water of sorcery, what confusion and mischief your sly, rebellious drops do generate! Without doubt, it was the tequila that made Bernard impatient, that befuddled him into mistaking the UFO conference for the Geo-Therapy Care Fest."  Oh please let me in I promise to be good. Not tell dirty jokes Or make fun of your hood As I sit at the bar  and play nice, oh I will. Eating all of my food as I lay off the swill.  WIth love.

The Tee Pee's been around since the 1950's and there's a reason why. Their dishes are some of the best in the valley in my opinion. Not all of them, but certainly their stuffed chile rellenos and green chile dishes.   One of their boastful claims is how former President GHW Bush visited on at least one occasion, evidenced by their naming a menu item in his honor;  'The President's Plate'.  This leads me to wonder if Bush was laid-up the next day with a severe case of red-ass, and if that led to any world war-type events.  I know the day after my birthday celebration I was shittin' razor blades, and god help anyone who came in contact with me that day. So I can see where Bush might be all;  "Oh yeah, Cheney? Well I'll show that piece o' shit Saddam what swift American justice looks like.  Someone get me a red button to push, STAT!!! Oh, and wet wipes too-somebody PLEASE get me some wet wipes-fast!  "I'll teach Saddam Hussein a lesson he won't forget anytime soon."  Anyway, if you like Sonoran style Mexican food, but more importantly, hot Mexican, try Tee Pee.

For some reason, drinking and loud music just seem to go together.  You know what else goes with drinking and loud music? Young people.  Personally, I like young people.  They just seem so much happier than old people.  Young people are fun too, as they're often quick to experiment with alcoholic concoctions guaranteed to knock their dick in the dirt. (presuming of course there's a dick involved).  This is why I go to Sapporo. No, not to get my dick knocked in the dirt...hell, I can do that at home. I go there because they have a discounted happy hour menu, costing about half of what others charge for this stuff, and, yes...to watch young people get their dick knocked in the dirt.  I wish I could offer some guidance as it relates to menu items but I can't.  It seems that while the two or three take-charge type A's in our party are dutifully filling out the order form, I'm dutifully filling my gut with sake and beer.  Unfortunately, I don't know what I just ate and for all I know, it could be filet of sharpei.  In short, if you're young and like to party, and, have a dick sorely in need of getting knocked int he dirt, you might want to try this place. If you don't have a dick, bring your boyfriend or husband.  After a few sake bombers....you'll have a dick on your hands for sure.

At the time of this review, there were 507 preceding mine.  Why bother? I asked myself. If a Yelper can't conclude what this place is about in the first ten or so reviews, (4 stars or higher) how's mine going to make a difference? Then it hit me. I could review the table setting.. So here you go, my review of Nobu Las Vegas, and my table experience.  Our table was nice and had all the features one would expect of a nice table such as legs and a top. It didn't wobble either, nice and firm, some may even say heavy.  And it was slightly rectangular, with a nice wood surface. Very pleasant looking.  Adorning our table were some chopsticks, and a couple of plates. The plates were nice. Small but nice, and as plates go, they seemed a better quality of porcelain than most. They were also square. This caught my eye right away, as I sat there thinking, "Gee, these plates are square...how cool is that?" And highly functional too! We used them to eat our food from, carefully filling them with food from the serving dish, which was also nice, only much bigger and a lot  nicer than our little square plates When the food was on our small square plate, we then used our chopsticks to start eating, which I should mention, worked just fine.   Now let me stop here. It would be sinful of me not to mention the chopstick presentation. My chopsticks came in a nicely wrapped white package, similar to what drinking straws come wrapped in.  However. Our server, opened them up for us, carefully placing them on a cute little black rock. Or maybe it was a stone. I'm not certain.  The stone was small and black, and looked like it might have been some kind of vintage variety of stone, (or rock) that I've never seen before...almost resembling an Apache Tear or something. It may have been volcanic too, I'm not sure.  This is what made me think it was a stone or lava, and not a rock. Anyways, kudos on the stone selection.   Then there was the little container of soy sauce.  OMG! It was small and looked like a miniature teapot, like something Alice would use when she was small Alice and not big Alice.  I take that back.  It would have been about the same size as small Alice, so forget i said that. Anywho,  it was white, and cute, and had a nice little pouring spout.   Overall, my table was amazing. Its size and shape. Just the perfect thing to eat off of. Nice and clean too, adorned with plates, a cute stone, some chopsticks, and a miniature teapot.  Oh, and one more thing.  There was a napkin too. I think it was linen but I''m not sure.  Large and colorful, it did a nice job of wiping my face, hands, and, I think I even  may have sneezed into it once.  I don't recall, but I'm pretty sure i did.  The large napkin would have been a bonus had I needed to spit anything out that didn't suit me,  leaving a large unused portion of it to clean up with afterward. But fortunately, I didn't have to spit anything out. Probably never will either... not as good as their food is.   If you go, I highly recommend one of the small rectangular tables. They're soooo amazing.

I called the band last week, hoping we could meet in Vegas for a reunion. We did.  Sadly, I can't talk about it because, well, you know, 'What happens....'.  The only thing I will say is that we ate at Nobu's and it was grand. After dinner, we wandered through the Hard Rock Hotel checking out the varioous rock legend exhibits, wondering how the fuck it was that a drummer with one arm (Def Leppard) got his drum set in the Hard Rock, and mine got sold to some pre-pubescent fucker at a garage sale for a hundred bucks. Fucking hell.  Nobu's has the best fish on earth. Best pineapple martini's too. None of the fish smells like cooch either, unlike the sushi shithole I go to in Phoenix.  Double bonus.

If you frequent this restaurant enough, management bestows their highest honor to its loyal patrons - your caricature prominently displayed on the wall.   They don't however bestow any awards for those who attempt to eat directly from their plate, as if in a pie eating contest. But then they don't throw you out either.  I know this after two successive years of waking up the next morning with garlic mashed potatoes in my hair and eyebrows.  If you dine here, and perchance exceed the 10mg suggested dose for marijuana edibles just a skosh, say by 200 mg, don't ask to be seated on the patio. In fact don't ask to be seated anywhere.  Get back to your hotel room post-haste and enjoy the total body paralysis that WILL be your weekend. I think that's why management didn't boot me. They probably got a good laugh out of all the Forum Shops passersby who laughed at my potato coiffe.  My friends loved the experience, said the service and food was excellent.  Especially my buddy, the one whose picture is on the wall in the bar area.  I do recall that much - laughing at the size of his teeth until I Chris Reev'd out.  I'm going to have a damned good talk with my neighbor who gave me the edibles. Apparently, his cancer is no match for my sciatica.  PS. I did find a petite filet (9 oz) in my cargo shorts the next day. It was cooked Pittsburgh style absolutely perfectly.  Big shout out to the chef, and to a lesser extent, Polo.

My parents were ashamed of me when I was born, "We think he got the waterhead from Diego senior's uncle Pietro," they would often tell friends. How fucked is that? Back then, people didn't use PC terms like 'Hydrocephalic', no, they used the more caustic, 'waterhead'. Actually, as it turned out I wasn't a waterhead baby at all. I just had (have) a large cranial area. One that requires extra large sunglasses. And that brings us to Vegas.  Well guess what.  Few places carry the elusive 62mm Ray Ban Aviators save for the Sunglass Hut at the Las Vegas Premium Outlets.  I now have a pair of sunglasses so big, they manage to conceal:   * Unibrow nubbins ( non-shave days)  * Bloodshot eyes  * Suitcases  * Cleavage gawking  * Dozing at company events  * Skunk-eye  * Crow's feet (maybe Eagle's by some standards)  * Missing pupils (mine don't just dilate, they expand to the same size as Jupiter  * Missing eyelashes (never grew back after last year's Labor Day Barbeque)  * Welling up at the end of Dirty Dancing  I also get my 501's here. They have odd sizes in all fashions.  I have "Hydrobooty" too.  My parents called it a bubble-butt. I never liked them.

Egg drop soup at ninety-nine places out of one hundred will be flavorless, bland and boring; usually requiring the addition of soy sauce in a last ditch effort to salvage some level of flavor out of it. Not here. Jade Palace IS that one in one hundred place.  A restaurant where the egg drop soup is such a brightly colored yellow, It will remind you of the scene in Pulp Fiction where Samuel L. Jackson opens the briefcase and whatever was in it, presumably gold, cast a golden hue onto his face. Its that bright! And the flavor? Incomparable. Rich with depth and flavor. A rarity for egg drop.   The egg drop soup however was merely foreplay as compared to my entree; Egg Foo Yung. Most EFY's are served patty-shaped, or, as a thin layer covering the plate.  Not here.  Here, your EFY expectations will be overly exceeded when as you see it being delivered, you're unable to recognize it as an EFY.  Mountainous, it looks like a beautifully golden browned soufflé, hot out of the oven.  You can't wait to sample it.  It's then you discover how its uncanny resemblance to a perky D-cup is the clever result of not one, but several layers of spongy EFY goodness. And to augment this delight, (as if a D-cup would ever need augmentation) there's a gravy boat filled to its gunwales with a rich and flavorful brown sauce, tying the dish together in a tightly woven knot.   A pleasant young server.  Egg Drop soup with a flavor so extraordinarily rare, I can still taste it.  And a gigantic EFY mound that was definitely 'more than a mouthful'.  That's what i call the ultimate Chinese experience.   PS My wife had the Chicken Chow Mein, which I didn't sample until 3 o'clock this morning. It was cold, gelatinous, and served in a box, which in no way resembled a big golden breast.  A disappointment by any uber-male hetero / lesbianic account, to say the least.

If you're young, you eat Chinese at Flo's. If you're older, you eat here.  Jade doesn't salt the shit out of its menu like most other Chinese restaurants. You know how I know this? I'm not up half the night gulping water like some kind of African beast at a Serengeti watering hole....after a rain...in the summer...in the midst of a drought.  Try the bbq egg foo yung. It's a triumph. The egg drop soup is extraordinarily flavorful with a velvety smooth texture and rich egg flavor.   The other big clue how safe the food is fairly obvious....the place is littered with old people. And if there's one thing I know about old people it's this... They didn't get to be old by eating double double bacon mcrib cheeseburgers like it was their job. No sir. These geriatric oddities got to where they are by eating smart.   Jade resembles smart, offering some of the best and most authentic Chinese around. Get there early though. Snowbirds are back in town and taking over these kinds of places like they belong to some kind of militant faction ready to rip society a new one. Pasty a-holes.

Authentic Chinese food. I wouldn't know it from cold, boiled weasel. But here's what I do know. The slop they serve up as Asian at most chains is about as authentic as Sasha Grey's onscreen orgasms. (Unless we're talkin Slut Puppies 2, her crowning glory). Not Jade.  Jade serves up food that's on par (or at least close) with The Empress of China, one of my favorite San Francisco haunts. That's why Jade is on my bi-monthly rotation during season, switching to weekly when the snowbirds have gone back to where-the-fuck-ever.  Last night was yet another great experience. Fast friendly service, great tasting food, and well-prepared cocktails. We even got to visit with the owner, who was auspiciously holding court as he lit from table to table...his upbeat demeanor forcing smiles from even the most curmudgeonly of patrons.  My go-to dish is the House Special Egg Foo Yung which is served with a medium-sized ramekin of brown gravy. A must for any aspiring redneck / gravy aficionado. It's twelve bucks and worth every cent.  IMPORTANT WARNING: If you're Italian with a federal RICO warrant for your arrest, or, like to pay with counterfeit money, stay the hell away from here.  The owner explained how in his eighteen years in the business, he got his first fake twenties recently which means the FBI is probably now watching the place. Isn't that special.

Being a second generation Italian-American, I'm uniquely qualified to do very little save for cooking and laying around in my underwear / beater all weekend. That's what us Italians do. Well, that's not all we do.  We shoot people, launder money, and violate the RICO act in about a hundred different ways. But wait, that's not all. We eat. And we eat, and eat and eat. Even when we're not eating, we're planning our next meal.  And sometimes, when we get sick of cooking and eating we go out to eat. And where do we go?  We only go to small, non-chain Italian restaurants. Why? Because there's usually some guy in the kitchen fresh off the boats who cooks Italian better than God himself.  And that's why I come here. For a real taste of Italy, and not the culinary slop from some chain whose kitchen staff is about to get busted by Sheriff Joe.  The veal saltimbocca, wedding soup, and pasta e fagiolo, combined with their bread, chianti and olives will make you feel like you're at your aunt's house for Sunday supper. The only thing missing is your aunt and her hairy upper-lip.  Now, mangia. And remember, watch what you say. The Feds are listening in.

Cibo's pies are ambrosial.  Wood fired, thin crusted and a chewy crumb all combine to produce a pizza that will rival any of the famous New York eateries, including Rays. Their pies in a word are simply delectable.  Situated in a 1913 ranch house, your seating options are limited to:  * Small bedrooms, appointed similarly to a 1913 small bedroom; about a half dozen     tables with about 15-20 people to a room. If you want an intimate experience, these    rooms aren't the place. Despite their talking softly, I still overheard the next table's    plans for In Vitro, and since my wife was absent any form of communication, I     can proudly say I know just about all there is to know about In Vitro fertilization.    Thanks bunches to you two for speckling my lunch with all your sperm speak.  * The bar area is also small but quaint and nicely appointed. I'm guessing you need     to time your arrival with the exact moment they unlock their doors if you have    any designs on bar-flying it.   * The patio area, where no misters abound, is certain to transform your date into     a sweaty Betty just moments after being seated. Perfect for old hippie chicks who     still sport patchouli as their primary cleansing function.  Cibo's parking is limited. Your choices are street parking or street parking. And remember, you're in downtown Phoenix...the same streets playing host to every ass-wart of societal humanity, so be sure to lock your car, set your alarm, and put your valuables in the trunk.   Overall, Cibo wins high praises for its fare, despite its quirkiness, lack of parking, and low sperm count patronage.

If I want good pizza, I stay home and make pizza because honestly, no human hands can make pizza as good as me.  I was classically trained by generations of my Italian family to make the best pizza ever.  Its true.  I'm a pizza God of sorts.   And then there's Grimaldi's. Grimaldi's pizza is the closest thing to New York pizza as you can get.  Thin crust, coal fired oven, minimal sauce...in short, the pizza that NY is famous for.  Grimaldi's, I hate to say, is so good, it makes my pizza look and taste like it was made by a 6-year old in one of those Easy Bake Ovens.  So if my pizza is off the hook and Grimaldi's makes mine taste like shark chum, well, that's the highest possible endorsement I can give a pizza place.  Unless they have pole dancers, which they don't.

Wood fired pizza cooked to perfection.  Thin crust, not burnt but caramelized brown, crunchy and flavorful.  Your taste buds will delight, having their own little food orgy of sorts with the personal white with garlic.  The house pinot noir is above average too.   Now let's talk about why I rarely visit.  DC Ranch seems to be littered with these really obnoxious creatures some people like to call 'children'.  They're everywhere and it's enough to make you re-think your dreams of ever having a family.   Try to have a nice conversation with your wife as some out-of-control bugger circles your table, looking up at the both of you with both arms raised as if he's some kind of tribal chief leading an attack on you both. This as his mom and dad seated at the next table look on with loving adoration.  I suppose they're looking to see our reaction....validating their kid's cute factor or something. I hate that.  Listen up DC Ranch thirty something's with 'children';                     YOUR KID ISN'T CUTE. HE'S ALARMING.   Because after my third glass of wine and without notice, I go to scoot my chair back to make a restroom visit and knock Chief Circling Diapers to the floor while his parents, the people who only a moment ago held a look of  loving adoration, now hold a look of contemptuous hatred. Like it was my fault, right? Why couldn't you have simply left him strapped to his high-chair and ignored him like every other parent in there?  No, you have to turn him loose so everyone can see his spastic, just-learned-to-walk dance moves.   Maybe the kid will learn something from this.  Maybe you'll learn something from this.  Like how your kid is cute and all, but  how turning him loose on the other diners for a few "Oh..look how cute" compliments is going to send him down for the count faster than Mike Tyson in a Xanax funk.  Order out next time, please? Arghhhh.

I just realized how a Grimaldi's Pizza is absent a puffy edge. I've never noticed this before. Mainly because I'm too busy gawking at all the bad plastic surgery forty somethings and their out-of-control kids.   No complaints.  The pizza is thin and flavorful, but the big rounded edge (cornicione) that's both chewy and crispy was missing, which led me to the conclusion that our pie resembled more of a flatbread than a traditional pizza.  The other thing you won't find here is a traditional Napolitana pie.  No sign of a Margherita anywhere on the menu. They do however offer additional basil for two bucks which will get you a reasonable facsimile.  If you want a great pie, go to Naples.  A good pie, Chris Bianco's Pizzeria Bianco in south Phoenix. And a pie that's light years above the chains and consistent as hell, Grimaldi's.  So you're not going to get a big cornicione. Nor will you get a traditional Margherita. But, you will get a Saturday night, plastic surgery freakshow that'll make most men do a full body shiver, like after taking a pee.

When its time for a special lunch or dinner, this is our restaurant. It has never disappointed, their attention to details being second to none.  Pricey? Yes, but worth every sumptuous mouthful. I only have one small complaint.  It seems ironic that a restaurant that puts so much emphasis on all the small details would willfully  disregard having a basic dress code. I presume this is in favor of just accepting Scottsdale-eccentrics as poorly dressed so long as they have a Lamborghini in the Valet area or a  gold Rolex.   I'm not stuffy nor do I purport to be. On the contrary, I have a healthy respect for any business that goes out of its way to please its customers and in this case, make my dining experience superb. So its hard for me to reconcile this attention to detail with an under-dressed (jeans and a t-shirt adorned with some rude saying) sloppy looking patron in the lounge.  For me, it was a question of "what's wrong with this picture?" Ambiance, a beautiful bar area, fine furnishings, staff dressed to the nines, and amidst it all, a sloppy looking man sitting at the bar, who, twice during the course of my lunch frequented the men's room (displaying his rude t-shirt for all to see). I realize its tough to walk away from potential revenues, but really, c'mon guys.  Theres no such thing as being half pregnant, either youre a classy joint or youre not.

If you're not vegan or vegetarian, chances are good you've come here for a good beef entree. But a good cut of beef can be expensive, especially when the sides are sold separately. It's the middle of the week and you're low on cash.  What to do. What to do.  You're a carnivore right? Well it's high time you started acting like one, especially if you want to impress that date of yours. Go with the calve's liver. You heard right.  Calve's Liver.  At thirteen dollars, it's the least expensive entree Capital Grille serves up, but by far the most flavorful. Smothered in onions and bacon, this dish will have any purist begging for more with each mouth-watering bite.  And besides, you'll save big $$ on sides since it comes with all the onions and bacon.  You won't find this delight anywhere on the menu, but ask your server. On most days the chef has it available and will cook it to order. I always request well done, and unless you hail from a Twilight novel, owning a real penchant for the taste of blood, I recommend you do the same.  Also, it's worth mentioning how this was the first time I've ever gotten out of here for under a hundred bucks, but I did have to eat baby cow organs. Oh well, at least it wasn't a lung or something.  Here's another useful tip. This location has full-length oil paintings of prominent figures in Arizona history.  Don't let them sit you in the room facing Geronimo. I had to stare at that wagon-burner throughout my entire supper.

Chelseas has good food, service and ambiance. Fun crowd too. Prices are reasonable relative to their offerings, including drinks. Definitely on our rotation.  Don't fill up on dinner and dessert so you can try the gratis chocolate chip sea salt cookies on your way out.

As promised, thirty-five minutes after entering, at seven on a Tuesday night, with no reservation, in the summer, we were finally seated.  To say this place is crowded would be an understatement. Nowhere to sit at the bar, no place to loiter while waiting on a table. It was nuts to butts in there.  I did what anyone would do.  I went outside, plopped down on a concrete bench hoodged-up next to one of the high-tops where a typical American family was having dinner,mom, dad, teen daughter and son.  Mom was a typical forty-something, can't let go of her youth mom, bedazzled, tummy showing with overflow skinny jeans. She was bitching out her daughter.  Daughter was all; "You don't even know Gretchen, how can you say she's a bad influence just because her tongue and nipples are pierced, you're so old fashioned! I want a tattoo."  Fat son spoke to no-one, he was busy playing video games on his phone. Totally disconnected. I look for him in a bell tower with an assault rifle in a few years.  Then there was forty-something dad: Mindlessly staring away from it all, furtively eyeballing the seemingly endless procession of tang arriving at the valet station... as if he was still a twenty-something poonslayer. Lustfully watching, drooling as they filed inside, their black mini's and f me pumps prominently on display. I'll bet he was probably thinking about how fucked his life is with these three winners.  Me? I just sat there drinking my Green Flash IPA, taking it all in, until the text came that our table was ready.   My salmon was 18 bucks and good, it came with kaleslaw, weird, but good too.  People of all ages here, mostly families.  Mostly dysfunctional families from what I witnessed.  Snagged about a dozen of the free cookies on the way out the door.  Forgot change for the valet. Paid him in chocolate chip cookies. Better than stiffing him.

Short of driving to Punkin Center (Arizona) on a Saturday night and having your ass seriously beaten by real cowboys for doing little more than ordering a beer that wasn't Coors regular...I highly recommend this place.  At Greasewood, I can wear all my cowboy gear, don a fake accent like I'm some sort of backwoods bumpkin, and not have to worry about some real cowboy wanting to punch my shit out when I order a Mexican beer.   There's are four regulation horseshoe pits out back, individual fireplaces, live music, dancing, and tons of out-of-towners whose women, impressed by what appears to be a real cowboy, will uncomfortably stare at you for the better part of the evening. And here's the best part.  I don't even have to worry about getting my butt kicked since most of the guys whose women are ogling my getup are either nerdy or pasty white...signaling they're from Minnesota or someplace like it.   The food? Forget about the food.  Greasewood is all about the campfire, booze, band, dancing, and being ogled by pasty white chicks from the east coast. It gets better.  Their menu only features burgers, dogs, chili, and tamales...the perfect fare to cap off a night of boozing it up. Don't worry about whether its tasty or if your server was rude, you'll pick up your order at a small window.   I'm here to tell you the food is fantastic, especially on the heels of a dozen beers and as many tequila shots. And if that's not enough for you, there's one more added delight.  On your way home, you'll get one of the most scenic views of the Valley's lights you'll ever witness. Simply gorgeous! So gorgeous, that while you're fixating on just how mesmerizing they are, it's about this time the narrow and unforgiving roadway will cause you to run your car off the road, where you'll have the pleasure of meeting the open desert and many of its cacti friends.  No worries. They're glad to have you, beseeching you with their welcoming gift of a thousand spiny needles as you wander around in the dark. This is when its smart to stay in your car and sleep it off.   Greasewood can be a great place for a fun night out with family and friends, or it can be your worst nightmare when the AAA  tow guy informs you he's unable to locate your vehicle, as you helplessly watch from your needle infested hell.

For all you out-of-towners, winter visitors, or anyone who wants a taste of early cowboy Americana, try this place. It's a western venue and, on weekends a biker hangout.   Only if you do come here, try not to smart-off to a cowboy or biker, saying something stupid like...         "Ahem..excuse me, do you know where I can find a server?"  That's where I can only pray someone will take you out back 'n beat you like a rented mule, mainly because you've got it coming.  There are no servers here.  Serve yourself, ya little pussy. (grumble)  Here's the rub.  You don't bring your fancy uptown shit to a cowboy / biker bar. We'll smell yer fake cowboy / cowgirl act a mile away.  And most of us natives can't stand you rich, pretentious wads.    Anyway, I hate snowbirds, but if it's any consolation, I pretty much hate me too, so don't think you're alone on this one.   The chile is tasty.  The burgers are huge and cheap. Beer is cheap too.  I wish I was an NFL star, with a ranch or something, where I could work in the off season.  I'd hurt some cattle, bet on it.   Oh, and suck it PETA.

The holiday season will soon be upon us, and that means one thing. Shopping for the ones you love.  Matching the right gift to that special someone is always a challenge, but it doesn't need to be. Not anymore. May I suggest the Yard House at Fashion Square?  Start your shopping here with some of Yard House's spectacular IPA flights, enough to insure you're buzzing like a high-voltage power line. Now it's time to get started with that shopping.  Take the short stroll to the information booth inside the mall, its just a few short steps away from the Yard House. This is where they sell gift certificates redeemable at any of the Fashion Square shops.  Next, inquire that the clerk run your card through the thingy to see what its limit is. Once you know the available limit, your judgment, sufficiently impaired from pre-shopping activities, will allow you to throw caution to the wind as you go balls on your loved ones. This is how I never fail to match the right gift with that special someone. But here's where it gets tricky. DO NOT max out the card.  I suggest leaving at least a hundred on it for your immediate return to the Yard House, where you''ll find refuge from all your holiday shopping madness.  Once safely at the Yard House, finish off your holiday spree with another couple rounds and some delicious chicken wings, again, being prudent to not max out the card.  Leave at least twenty bucks for the cab ride home.  PS. If possible, don't go shopping the same day as your wife. This will allow you to safely sneak out the house with HER Visa card.

HR calls you in unexpectedly.  You think you're fired for sure.  It had to be Jeremy in payroll you reckon...ratting you out for stealing your co-workers lunches out of the fridge, the little worm.  You're surprised.  In fact you're in shock when HR informs you of a raise and promotion.   You rush home to break the news to your wife, unfortunately, she's in your bed with Julio, the pool guy.  What do you do? Still in shock from the raise, you grab your gun and shoot them both dead.  You're proper fucked now.  Turns out Julio was an undercover police officer with a pool business on the side.  You're sentenced to die for your crimes, where you spend the next twenty or so years on Arizona's Death Row. It's the eleventh hour.  Still no call from the Governor to stay your execution.  That's when the warden comes in to ask what you'll be having for your last meal.  Without hesitation, you order Harkin's Theater movie popcorn and a Coke zero.  One problem. You didn't buy the Harkins loyalty t-shirt and cup, so he asks you to fork over $12.50 when it could have been only a dollar. Life's a bitch. Harkin's Theaters make it tolerable.

If I explained step-by-step how easy it is to prepare a great steak, you'd never go out for steak again.  Sure, you like to be pampered at times, those special occasions  when you want a great steak and don't mind laying down a couple of Benny's for it.  And this is why I come here. Not for dinner but for their happy hour.  Their happy hour features a number of items, and all for six dollars each, including the drinks. Beers are half that.   I've had dinner here several times and aside from being in an elegant atmosphere, where the detail to service is unrivaled, I simply can't justify spending this much for a steak dinner. No matter what the occasion.  I take that back, If my father-in-law died, I'd probably come here for two steak dinners.  One to celebrate his demise. The other to celebrate my celebrating his demise.   They still wouldn't be as good as mine. :)

Your ticket to celebrating with the who's who of Scottsdale begins here.  Only get here before five.   Fleming's reminds me of Rao's in Harlem, with its too few booths and dozen or so bar stools. If you want to enjoy your cocktail seated, if you don't feel like standing cheek to jowl with the many, lusting after one of these highly coveted seats, you'll need to arrive early.  Otherwise, the staff will banish you to the patio where you'll marvel at space heaters, a parking lot, and basically, a hoard of unlucky patrons whose untimely arrival caused them their no-so-great seating. Not much celebration on the patio, unless of course you're tripping balls on acid, marveling over the wonders of propane-fired umbrella heaters.  I arrived early and was rewarded with one of their booths. I watch as the bar hurriedly fills within moments of my being seated, this followed by the patio. Fleming's is nuts to butts by 5:05 and I can see why. Their happy hour menu.   Fleming's features half price drinks and appetizers until seven, all of which are over the top good. I order one of everything and politely ask the server to bring me a suitcase full of manhattan cocktails to wash everything down. She complies.  Now the fun. Watching as newcomers arrive late with no place to sit, furtively eyeballing your seat, coldly calculating your departure by assessing how much of your partially consumed entree remains. Much akin to a lady in a public restroom, these socialites will actually hover over your table until such time as the server shoos them away like the annoying social butterflies they are.  It's truly rewarding to see Scottsdale's entitled lusting after something I have for a change, even if it is a mere booth and not a Ferrari.   I hog the booth until seven, stumble out to parking area, you know, the one in plain sight of the patio people. It's there where I throw-up the manhattans and too-too fabulous sweet chili calamari.   Oh well, that's the price you have to pay if you wanna party with the pretty people. Fuck.  I wish I was a matador or something.

I wasn't aware Fleming's had an A/V room, replete with screen and ceiling projector. Do you know what else this room has? A light switch with no dimmer.  For those of you lucky enough to be seated in the main dining area, if you look toward the right rear of the room and see a very bright light, (sans the tunnel) that's the place.  When first ushered into the room, I asked if this was the steerage section. They didn't laugh.  Turns out, it WAS the third class section, only they were too nice to not inform us how we'd be eating our meal while being interrogated by a team of international spies, under an intensely bright light. To make it more fun, we were seated in the center of the room. These guys are real pranksters.  After a while, others were ushered into the room, all of whom looked like they'd fucked-up in the lobby while waiting on a table and were now being punsihed; a mom with a small whiny child, an old couple - both with walkers, and a couple so obese, I think they sat them in there so if the chairs collapsed, no one would see.  Fleming's - you made us feel like we didn't belong - as though we weren't good enough to sit in your half-empty dining area at 5:30 on a Saturday night.  The next time I hope to see a light this bright, it's going to be after trudging through a long-ass tunnel, looking for an old white haired guy in a robe with a big 'G' on his pocket.  Other than the bright light, dining with 'Goonies', and the extremely slow service, it was a real fucking hoot at 170 bucks.  If your hostess marches you toward this room, don't go in there. Fake a seizure of something. Just don't go in there.  You've been warned.

Come here on a Sunday when you're hungover.  Pick a table in the center of the dining room and vegetatively sit and stare out of the large plate glass windows wondering why, between Mastro's the previous night, El Santo all day Saturday, and the Candy Store, you somehow managed to blow just over 700 bucks this weekend.  LGO is a charm with its high energy young crowd adorned in yoga pants, and, its older hipsters, also wearing yoga pants.It would appear this place is some kind of Mecca for yoga pant aficionados.  The music is cool too. A friend recently spent the day here working, Shazaming their playlists. She found most of the songs on Pandora's 'Lumineers' station.  Anyway, I ate a chopped turkey salad, or at least a part of it while pensively gazing out the window, as If I was working on a cure for dick cancer or something.  The salad and a soda was ten bucks.  This is a great move, staring out of windows. Others will think you're an eccentric genius or something as you mindlessly stare directly through them while revisiting your bonehead moves from the weekend. A chuckle to yourself every now and again as you think about how Mastro's gets away with charging 11 bucks for a baked potato, and how a certain stripper at the Candy Store will pull out her false teeth for only a buck.   [another wave of nausea, hang on a sec]  As I said, this is a great place to feel good about yourself when you get a load of how other people are more screwed-up than yourself. Granny hipsters in unfulfilled (pancake butt) yoga pants that oddly enough, manage to somehow telegraph the outline of an equally loose fitting thong.  Now there's a nice 'eewww' moment.  I yakked up the salad afterwards, but it had nothing to do with the food or the ill-fitted thongs. I think it was the hard-boiled egg and my hellacious hangover. The thong visual was pretty messed up though. Anyway, a strong recommend.

Italian-Americans are a weird bunch on the whole. Everyone has a family recipe for some type of dish that's 'the absolute best they've ever had'. It's true. "Nobody can make sausage or meatballs like mama, or, her vodka gravy for that matter." Yeah, Yeah, heard it all before.  Well I've got news for you's people. Short of taking a trip to Philly's Little Italy section, you're not going to find a better chain serving Italian anywhere.  It may not be like your mom's, but then you also won't have your mom giving you shit for the hour and a half you're at her home, while she makes you a plate of pasta and braciole. See, that's the payoff for good Italian. Getting a fucking lecture on how your wife "can't do anything right" and how you should have married the DeLuca girl from down the block.   Service is good. Ambiance is well above average.  It's a huge building with lots of people to stare at, despite mama telling you not to do so. She also told you to teach your wife to cook if you weren't going to marry an Italian which is why you're here to begin with. Fucking mama. She's always right.

This can be a rewarding experience if you plan for it, leaving those rookie buffet-goer mistakes at the door. Known only as "The Silent Hunter" by family and friends, my demeanor morphs from free spirit into a wily predator about to viciously attack his prey when at a buffet such as this.  Here are my tips for a successful buffet outing at Rio's Seafood Buffet:   *  On the day of the buffet, no lunch or unnecessary snacking  At the buffet:  *   No salads, breads, or any other useless filler foods. Their conspicuous       presence near the crab legs and shrimp could throw you off your game.      Don't fall for it.  *  Your table waiter will take your drink order. Be prepared for its arrival in a large     red plastic cup roughly the same size as one of those Big Gulps, another clever      ruse designed to slow your eating stride. Too much liquid, forget it.  *  The shrimp. Oldest trick in the book! It's still in the shell, not good. Time is your      biggest opponent here  Eating slowly will cut your consumption rate by almost      half. (I have no empirical data to support this, just a guess)  I know it's tempting      but don't bother with the shrimp, not now at least. We'll come back to that in a     a moment.  And this brings us to the piece de resistance ; the crab. A couple of problems however. Let's walk through them shall we?    First, its still in the shell and cold, sitting on an ice bed since God knows when. Second, its snow crab, not much yield for the effort.  Here's what you do. Bring a pair of gloves with you to the restaurant. White gloves, with which you'll inform your server of their concealing a rare medical condition; "I've got leprosy", you inform her, "Unless you want a rotting-skin, shit-show on your hands, you'll need to remove the shells from my crab. You'll also need to heat it up for me...my gums are sensitive to cold. Oh, and bring some clarified butter, and maybe a pound o' shrimp while you're at it, peeled of course."  Now eat my friend. Eat until you mightily swell like a blue tick, or, until the manager asks you to leave, or, you explode, whichever comes first. Now go and enjoy.

What a monumental shithole Treasures.  Cover charge at 4:30 in the afternoon was $33.00. Almost immediately upon entering you're besieged with hustling bitches trying to shake you down for table dances at twenty bucks a pop. Should you decline, they'll step up their marketing skills by offering you a package of five dances for only one-hundred dollars.  God, they're clever. I think that works out to, oh wait, twenty dollars a dance. As I said, clever.  When servers ask for your drink order, they'll immediately ask how you're going to pay for it, suggesting perhaps you may be homeless and without funds for such a wondrous event.  The look on your face suggests you're experiencing a wtf moment.             " Cash or credit card?" she annoyingly barks while you're still in disbelief.  Shaken down at the door, now insulted, as if you were going to swill down a beer and beeline it for an awaiting cab without paying, you begin to reassess if any of this was worth it.  Whether your response is cash or credit, they'll demand payment up front prior to taking the order. I believe this is because, and this is only conjecture mind you, their default statement is to not trust anyone who graces their shit hole establishment for fear they're part shit hole too. It's a projection thing I guess.  Don't get suckered into a VIP dance in the back room by one of the many fleeting nubiles promenading about.. They're there for one reason. To take you to the 'back room'. If you do get suckered into a back room dance, the fee starts at $100 with a $32 two-drink minimum, again, all paid up front of course. And god help you if you happen to get caught up in the moment, losing count of your five song 'deal'. The sixth song just shot the price up to $250 along with a now $50 two-drink minimum.  It's like being penalized for getting caught up in the music and whirling tits!  You're now knee-deep in the shit, having unwittingly purchased the multi-dance package and guess what? This time, the dancer doesn't shake you down for loot, she waltzes you over to some guy bigger than all outdoors, whose tone of voice is lower than a 30" subwoofer and whose countenance is that of a guard at Buckingham Palace.     "Two hundred fifty bucks pal, how you gonna pay?"   I panic. The eighth song just began playing and I don't know what the rules are. The seventh shot the price from twenty to thirty-five. After everything I've seen thus far, I'm thinking they're going to ask me to pony up a nut when song number eight begins playing. I cut my losses and head for the door.  When you've had enough of their bullshit and want to take a cab back to the hotel, guess what, no cabs.  Oh there are cabs, a cab line and a valet, but you're not going anywhere...not just yet.  That's because you'll need to grease the valet, this or else wait in a terminally long line of losers who didn't have money to line the valet's pockets.  Here's what I did. I saw an off-duty cab about 100 yards from their driveway entrance and started toward it.     "HE'S OFF DUTY!" the valet shouts.       "FUCK YOU," I respond politely.   I offered the taxi driver a fifty to take me anywhere as fast as he could. This so I could begin erasing the entire shitty experience out of my memory.  He declines, saying he'll get in trouble with va-ray. (Asian) I make it a Franklin.    " Hop in" he says.  Everything about Treasures smells to high heaven, including the plethora of Russian whores in cheap perfume and glitter. You'll know who they are immediately. They speak with the same dialect as that ugly bitch from Rocky & Bullwinkle.  I would only come back here if I won the lottery.

When Eddie V's closed its Market Street location, the lady on the phone suggested we go to WIldfish, saying there was some direct relation between the two.   I don't know what the relationship is, but I think it's like one of those cousins you've never met...know nothing about...but your mom told you if you were going to be in Cleveland for the weekend, to stop in and say hi.  We did and couldn't believe the difference between the two restaurants. While both modern with lavish decor, one is great, the other, so-so.  I'm talking about Wildfish. This is the relative that had I met earlier in life, I would have scoured Ancestry.com to learn how far removed she was and if from our resulting marriage, our kids would grow to become cretinous jackals.   I fell in love. With the server, who was dressed in a white tuxedo designed by 18th century King Leopold. With the food and the portion sizes, which I had to switch over from hunger to sport eating midway through the meal. And the dessert.  The dessert.  Who makes pinapple upside-down cake these days besides that one older aunt of yours...the one who smells like a vagrant? The pastry chef, that's who.  This dessert is so sumptuous, you'll guard it like it was enriched plutonium, and your date was really the Russian chick from Bullwinkle trying to steal it out from underneath you.  My advice? Order two of these.  One for Natasha, and the other so you don't have to keep a furtive eye on her fork.

Don't you love it when you walk into a place, and the bar is situated so everyone can't help but notice the sudden burst of daylight, eclipsed by the shadowy figure that is you? The door closes behind you, they're still looking.  What are they looking at you wonder. Didn't they have moms who taught them it wasn't polite to stare? Yet they do, and now you're uncomfortable.  Mom always said the only reason people stare is if you're really attractive or really repulsive.  Thanks mom...like that helps right now.   You take a seat at the bar, order your drink, and begin to look around while settling in.  And this is the point where you realize how you've just entered some sort of twilight zone where only beautiful people exist.  Even the old people are beautiful.   Two stars for the hostess not turning me away.  This isn't the place for torn 501's, black Chuck Taylor's, and a t-shirt with 96 bold font reading  "Excuse me...you're standing on my penis."  This is the place where people look as though they've just fallen out of a page from Marie Claire, or Esquire.  Not Guns and Ammo.  May I suggest the one-dollar oysters and several beers with which to wash the slimy shites down? I know, you hate oysters...right?  Me too.   The oysters are necessary however in this situation, as they demonstrate your culinary prowess, negating your lack of fashion, raising you up a few pegs...going from classless mook to eccentric cool guy. And all for a buck each, go figure.  The many, many beers provide goggles. Also needed to help gravitate your fellow pub-goers down a few pegs...to your level. At least in your mind anyway.  Once the playing field is level, now you can strike up a conversation with Miss Thing who's seated next to you. I hope she can read my shirt.

The only reason to eat here is to avoid the long lines waiting to gain access to Tao Nightclub.  Once you've finished dining, your waiter will usher you past all the line-losers to gain your rightful spot amongst the beautiful people.  It's there you'll wonder why, after six vodka and Red Bulls, your 'buzz' more resembles a Sunday afternoon on the couch than the dance party you'd hoped for. Well duh, you just ate enough food for a small village in the Sudan. On the bright side, you didn't have to wait in line.  Avoid the 'family' meal experience. The bill was a stack before the tip for 8 of us.  Stick with the sake bombers instead.  Tao has a unique device that cleverly drops six shots into six beers simultaneously. It's so fascinating, you'll want to try this at least a dozen or so times. Don't forget to shout out some Asian babble as you salute the Emperor or else the bombers have very little effect.  The sea bass was a triumph. The beef was like butter - I'm guessing it was Kobe, and if it wasn't, it was likely from a bull who'd had his nuts cupped daily by some half wit.

After my review of Salsita's 6, I've come to have faith in the cumulative point rating system.  SImply enumerate the various categories and let the chips fall so to speak.  Phoenix Police Department.  Five stars for my arresting officer and how interested he was in my life - asking a ton of questions - seeing the real me as a person instead of just another perpetrator. He seemed genuinely concerned about me, and under any other circumstances, I could totally see me and him as besties.  You just don't see that kind of caring any more.  Another five for his using nylon ties in lieu of those pesky steel handcuffs. And yet another three for his super clean backseat. I thought it would smell like puke or crack dealer or something.  Where are we, thirteen so far?  Minus five for the butch officer who fingerprinted me and failed to acquiesce to my request for a hairbrush and some product prior to the mugshot - I looked like Nick Nolte and Gary Busey's illegitimate child.  Deduct another five for the Madison Street Jail facility and its 'open' toilets in the holding tank. If you have shy bladder syndrome, this is not the place for you after a night of prodigious drinking.  And I'm going with a negative two for what I think may have been an egg Mcmuffin they served up for breakfast, although I'm not really sure what it was.  Overall, I'd have to say this really wasn't as bad an experience as my friends have let-on over the years, and, it does give me the chance to see if Philips and Associates are as good they say.  Where's that leave us - one? Yeah, no, pretty sure that's one star.  Hmm, probably won't come back.

If you like to gamble, and by gamble I mean serious sports betting, then you're all too familiar with the term vig. (short for vigorish) Which is why I've avoided this place for so long, the name simply repulsed me.   No wait.  It didn't repulse me. It dredged up bad (really bad) images of Super Bowl 36, where that piece of shit Tom Brady staged a last minute comeback, killing my point spread.  This is about the time you learn what a vig is, and how much it means to a bookie. Fuck. I digress, sorry.  The Vig is full of good looking people, so the ambiance gets high praise. Food is well above average, try the Thai Chili Chicken Wings.  Coors Banquet served in old fashioned 12 ounce bottles had me fantasizing I was a cattle rustler in the old west.   Crowded on a Wednesday night, our crew sat on the patio. It was hot out and I got a bad case of swamp ass. Luckily, I carry a small ziplock of gold bond mentholated powder which resembles about $10,000 worth of coke.  The guy in the men's room who saw me putting it on my butt thought I was crazy. I told him coke on your sack is quite the experience if you can afford it.    After that, my ass felt like it was smoking Newports throughout dinner, enjoying my  Vig experience for the first time since Super Bowl 2002.  Anyway, I like this place and you probably will too.  Wait till the weather cools off if you're going to sit on the patio, or else have some mentholated butt powder handy.

Living in the high desert in North Scottsdale, it's not unusual to see a myriad of desert varmints in my backyard on any given day. Well I don't like snakes.  The javelinas eat my flowers.  And the bobcats startle the shit out of me every time I see one, the sneaky little fuckers.  Worse yet, seeing one of these critters while on a hike or bike rides can really fuck with ones sense of peace and tranquility. This is why I carry both a knife AND a gun on me at all times during desert treks. Cabella's is the place I got outfitted.   My Winchester Ranger, a knife larger than the one Crocodile Dundee carried, and my Berretta 92F are the perfect weapons to administer swift desert justice to those in need. I simply duct tape them to my person, or bike, and voiia, I'm ready for a confrontation in the most pre-meditated, first degree sense of the word.  Whether its a fight to the death with some gnarly desert dweller, or the more mundane desert euthanizing, you can find all your safety needs at Cabella's.  I feel like the Dr. Kervorkian of the Sonoran Desert thanks to Cabella's.

It's that special occasion, and you need a special restaurant.  A place that will only serve to augment the nights festivities.   Mexican and most other ethnic foods are out, deciding early on how these foods will  trigger your irritable bowel syndrome into becoming an other-worldly dynamo of farts.  You can't have that, after all, it's a celebration.  You need something innocuous.  A food that's filling but not too.  And yes, a meal that won't induce a garlic aroma that will level all of Scottsdale.   Fish it is, and where better to spend your hard earned cash than at a place so proud of its creations, they charge you an arm and a leg for them. Only you'll soon learn an arm and a leg won't even cover the tip at this place. I give you Mastro's Ocean Club.  An elegant atmosphere, bustling with energy from all its young patrons eager to impress their date with a meal guaranteed to produce no ill-wanted side affects afterward.  Start with the seafood tower appetizer. This will cost you the price of that new Ipad you never bought yourself  for Christmas because you were too worried about your kids getting something they'd only sneer at.   Move on to the Salmon, which if it's not from Copper River, it should be since they've priced it that way. I'm conjecturing there's something unusual about it, making it so pricey.  My guess is they find some Inuit kid, post him up at one of those Alaskan rivers, paying the little bastard big bucks to snatch a salmon from the mouth of a hungry grizzly. Subsequently, due to the kld's funeral costs and reparations to his family, they have to jack-up the cost of the salmon.  Just a theory.  And finally, get ready to loosen that belt and finish up with one of their scrumptious desserts, I didn't. I couldn't. Not because I was full from the tower or the dead Eskimo kid's legacy, it was because I was out of coinage.  Didn't have enough for the tip. And didn't see  a small cup of orange jello on the menu anywhere.

Friday was going swimmingly well until I ran over a dog on the way to Mastro's. Some little fuckworth terrier was running around in circles in the slow lane on the 101 and next thing ya know, SPLAT!!!  I walk in and meet my party of six already seated. Still in shock, I order a martini. It arrives. I think Morticia Adams was the mixologist, it's brimming with dry ice vapors, like I'm drinking eye of newt or some shit. It gets better.  The lady seated next to me was a size  minus 2. She made Karen Carpenter look like a pregnant Adele. She started talking to me but I was fixated on the tire bump sound when I wasted the dog. I tuned in. Of all the fucking luck, guess what she wanted to talk about - you ready for this - her two Irish Setters.  Of all things in the universe to talk about, she decides to talk about her dogs. I order another Morticia special.  Four drinks in, the freeway dog kill now a distant memory, I ordered the biggest cut of beef they had - a twenty-four ounce cowboy something or other. I ordered it rare.  For killing someone's poopsie, the night didn't turn out too bad.  Mastro's helped me to wash the whole unpleasant event away, like it never happened.  The steak was amazing. So were the onion rings. The martinis knocked my shit out.  I just added dog-killer to my lugubrious resume. Mastro's was awesome. The size minus two went home with my friend. He said she looked like a holocaust victim when he got her naked.  Eeew.

I can think of no reason to give one more penny of my hard-earned money to Mastro's. Our anniversary dinner was supposed to be special - it wasn't.  Service was rushed.  We were a two top at 5:15 - the waiter had the warmth of a stop sign; his demeanor rushed throughout the visit. An unsolicited 'reminder' about how entrees take 25 minutes upon delivery of our appetizer "and to order soon' only signaled their wanting the table for another cycle, so we'd better hurry the fuck up!  Drinks are overpriced. Two cocktails came to just under 50 bucks. A glass of wine with dinner was 23.  Stop pushing the seafood tower for Christ's sakes!  We were two, not twelve. When I bring clients in, it's a consideration. Not a $300 pile of shellfish for two, however. I heard our server offering the damned thing to an eighty year-old couple seated next to us, thinking; "Now just how - IN THE FUCK - are these two old codgers going to wolf down a hundred pieces of shellfish, pre-meal no less!"  Oysters didn't taste fresh, making me wonder if they use canned oysters and re-use the shells like so many other chain seafood specialty restaurants.  "Black truffled mushroom sauce" an optional side for the steak topping, was anything but. It was white in appearance and had no detectable smell or taste of truffles - only high levels of sodium. For fifteen dollars, save your money. I had to scrape it off and loathe a little white pile of salted, shitty 'gravy' throughout the meal.  Lobster in their signature mashed potatoes were like bites from a rubber chew toy; overcooked and flavorless. (I think someone finally found the Busy Bee) Potatoes had a film of grease - butter I presume. Someone should have thought to give them a quick stir, like I had to do in order to make them visually pleasant enough to want to take a spoonful. Prior to my doing so, I watched as a small yellow puddle developed at the edge of the dish.  This was concerning.  Wife's drink was returned twice, both times too strong - overpowering the cucumber in the martini. Bartender must confused her with Amy Winehouse I suspect.  Six ounce filet ordered Pittsburgh style - no detectable char anywhere.  Wife's was ordered medium - nothing even mildly resembling pink.  If it wasn't for the tasty bread basket and plate of semi-soft butter, the dinner would have been a complete bust.   We stopped at AJ's on the way home for dessert.  After fooling us on every aspect of the meal, we weren't going to get fooled on another disappointing menu item. We skipped their dessert offerings.  When I told my wife this morning how the dinner was less than memorable for such an important anniversary, she disagreed, explaining; "Negative experiences can be just as memorable as can good ones." She's right.  When so many things go wrong as quickly as last night, ie; the returned drinks, the small flavorless oysters, the salted 'truffle' sauce, you (as in me) have to decide how many times you're going to send stuff back before it returns with a hidden present from the chef.  I realize this isn't likely at Mastro's, but I didn't want to be deemed the 'difficult' couple at table 31  and take the chance of pissing off the staff.   So we stopped sending stuff back after the drinks, took our lumps, and got the fuck outa there asap.  Goodbye Mastro's and good luck. You will never have to endure another of my Yelp rants - unfavorable or otherwise.

Wait until summer to come here, when the winter crowds have finally subsided.  On any given weekend during the summer, usually between one and five, you can waltz in, take practically any seat in the house and enjoy a few glasses of wine prior to your movie at the nearby Harkins 101. If you decide to have appy's, the guacamole is fresh and creamy, not overloaded with lime juice or spices. In other words, the taste of the avocado is strong and delicious. Their salsa is also very good. Fire roasted and mildly hot, it has a hint of sweetness, I presume from the veggies caramelizing during the roasting process. Tortilla chips are light, warm and crispy. It should be noted how the guacamole portion is fairly large, I'm guessing at least 1-1/2 cups worth.  In short, this is a nice place to while away the time, where the drinks, appys, ambiance and service are all well above average.

The manager contacted me after reading my review, suggesting how reservations are available and how this could help with not limiting my visits to only the summer.  The truth is, I don't like crowds, or the noise that belongs to them. I like empty restaurants that make me feel like King Fahd himself, as the staff showers me with attention. I like that the server isn't rushed, and will take time to tell us how her homophobe boyfriend refuses to accompany her to the movie 'Magic Mike'. \ And I like that I can have a conversation about anyone and everyone I know, talking more smack than a Navajo code-talker, my decibel level ever ascending and tethered to my alcohol consumption, while never having to worry who's within earshot. (The downside of being a native Phoenician...always running into people you know)  The fact is, sometimes I enjoy the solitude of an empty restaurant.  White Chocolate is a busy place during the winter, less during the summer, but almost always during peak times of the day. It's comforting to be able to enjoy a nice place like this, and have it all to yourself during non-peak hours.  Thanks anyway WC Manager, but I really like you best at certain times.   Like Sundays...in the summertime...at three o'clock in the afternoon.

I cleaned up early from Saturday's honey-do's and, left the Michigan Notre Dame game early to come here....and for what? Happy Hour ends at 5 on weekends. What a waste. I probably shouldn't be grousing, it did get me out of some weekend chores so that's not all bad and as it turned out, the game was on in the bar. Double bonus.  Last night's activities began with two twenty-ounce Lagunitas for 6.25 each.  Along with the beers were chips and guacamole followed by a salad topped with ahi, and all of this followed by a short walk to Harkins 101 for a movie.  Date night...arghh.  The salad and the guac are chart-toppers. Loved 'em both.  It's also important to mention how getting here by five insures you'll get a table in the bar, this so you can ignore your wife and watch the Michigan, Notre Dame game. It gets better. You can also watch the bar crowd file in during your stay as they scout for an empty table.  Well fuck 'em dry. They should have dropped whatever it was they were doing, gotten cleaned up at four o'clock like I did, missing almost thirty minutes of the game like I had to.  They can stand there all night staring at my empty plate and my unpaid bill for all I care. I'm not moving til this game's over or five minutes until the movie starts, whichever comes first.  I probably shouldn't have included my going to a movie afterwards in this review since it really has nothing to do with my WC experience, but I did want to warn my bro's about ingesting 40 ounces of Lagunitas, chips and guac, and a big tuna salad.  It's a triumvirate of fart cookery and WILL produce some major room-clearing farts....the kind you TASTE at the mall.... the day after Thanksgiving.   Although, I wasn't too bummed out pumping out heaters during the movie.  This was mainly because of the jerky bitch in front me who kept slamming her chair into my knees each time she was frightened.  I hope she huffed each and every one of them.  No, wait, you know what... I hope she tasted them before smelling them.  Ha! Ha! Ha!  My knee still hurts. What an a-hole.  Thanks White Chocolate for unknowingly supplying me with ordinates.

Abject disappointment is what best describes the whole of this experience, starting with happy hour on a Friday night only lasting until 5:30. Imagine that.  I'd happily slogged a beer halfway down before last call cast its gloomy shadow.  Quick, another beer and some appetizers before the cutoff. "WAITER!"  DM: (disappointed me) Uh, I'll have another 8th St and an order of the         happy hour chips and guacamole.  HD: (harbinger of disappointment, speaking uncannily like Bill Lumbergh from Office         Space) "Yeahhhh, nooooo, the guac isn't part of the happy hour menu         anymore. It's a side order. It's $9.99."  DM: (looking perplexed, thinking, what the fuck?)  "WHAT THE FUCK?" (FUCK          was heavily inflected)  HD: "Yeahhhh, sorrrry."  DM: "Alright, bring another beer and I'll have my order ready when you get back."  Beer arrives. It's 5:30.  HD: "Are we ready?"  DM: "Yup. Eleven more beers, the happy hour ribs, the happy hour shrimp, and           the happy hour Arizona egg rolls. That's for me. My wife wants seven           pomegranate martinis, an order of ribs, a water, three glasses          of ice, and about thirty napkins."  WTJA: (wife, now turned Jodi Arias, to me) "Have you lost your fucking mind?          (my heavily inflected FUCK had nothing on hers) Two hours from now you'll be          sawing logs on the family room floor and I'll be watching Dateline...again...         by myself. WE'RE LEAVING, NOWWW!"  NWOSIM: (neutered without surgical instruments me) "Yeah...just bring the check."   Our beloved White Chocolate Grill has, like so many other restaurants of its ilk, succumbed to cheaping-out on happy hour, overcharging for popular menu items, and now hosts a waiter whom if this was 1920's Alabama, I'd shoot him, barbecue him up, and feed him to local law enforcement officials at their annual picnic.  White Chocolate, I've been patiently waiting for this joyous time of year, the time when faux-Arizonans mass exodus to their cool summer abodes just like rats jumping off a sinking freighter. This is when I come knocking, so I can have you all to myself. And you pull this shit?  We're FUCKING through White Chocolate. (and this FUCKING has nothing on my wife's, which had nothing on mine).   DISCLAIMER  1.) I had just finished watching Office Space before heading out for happy hour.       Bill Lundbergh was everywhere.  2.) I wouldn't really shoot anyone like the girl in Fried Green Tomatoes. I would      however give them a savage tongue lashing, and not the Michael Douglas kind.  3.) My balls are detachable in situations such as this.  4.) I wish I'd taken the Rodeo Clown career path. Being gored a few times would       beat this.   5.) Mrrrrrrr.

With its finely appointed decor resembling a pub straight out of Dublin, the Skeptical Chymist is a visual funhouse, offering sanctuary to the pub-goer looking for something different.   A large chalkboard behind the bar lists a wide variety of handcrafted brews with alcohol contents ranging from five, to the much higher ten percent range typically found in double IPA's. I'm pleasantly surprised with each visit to see the constantly changing offerings.   Their happy hour menu features five dollar flatbreads that are absolutely scrumptious. But the piece de resistance is their corned beef and cabbage; a true delight with its perfectly cooked cabbage and  generous portion of corned beef slathered in a mustard onion demi-glace.   Kudos to our server who was quick to forewarn how the dish comes with a 'gravy', for had she not done so, I'm certain I would have been repulsed upon seeing my corned beef smothered in a brown gravy.  At first, we were both confused, our thoughts swimming around the idea of how gravy could add anything to corned beef. But this gravy is different.  They call it gravy, but it's an onion based demi glace with a slight hint of deli mustard which if you can believe, accents the corned beef into a culinary triumph.  One IPA, and a plate of corned beef for lunch and I found myself flat on the couch an hour later, sleeping Sunday afternoon away like a newborn, as Sundays are meant to be.  During the week, the Chymist is a fun retreat from work, with its all ages crowd, cigar-friendly patio, and extremely fair happy hour prices. The Chymist is a great place to unwind, or, have a fine meal that in no way resembles typical bar food.    I should probably mention how I've yet to find an unfriendly server or slow service.  That's not to say the service is somewhat slower when packed, but if you're there to pound brews instead of enjoying the moment, you'll likely disagree with this review.  Overall, nice job SC management.

Garcia's is a comfortable respite from all the cheesy Mexican food joints (probably a hundred or so) in the area. The decor, ambiance, and uniformed servers all give Garcia's a solid four stars.   The food? It depends.  Order one their signature items and you can't go wrong. Any of the combination lunch plates, chimis, or burritos...all good.   On this day I ordered a bowl of red chile. It arrived lukewarm but I didn't care since I was hungry enough to eat the ass out a dead and rotting rhino. I inhaled it. Then proceeded to make my guests nervous as I sat and stared at the food on their plates.  I'm guessing they liked their food too as they slowly did the hand-plate wraparound, overtly signaling how I should back the fuck off.  No problem, I ate an entire basket of chips. And when I finished them, they brought me another.  I had three diet cokes, two baskets of chips and a bowl of red chile. I haven't a clue as to what any of it cost since one of the guys I went to lunch with is richer than God himself and I knew he'd pay.  I know, it's fucked up for me to think like that, but I really didn't want to get into a pissing contest with him over a bowl of red chile and some free chips.  Not classy. Neither is throwing up in the parking lot for that matter.  I think I have an ulcer. I really need to get it checked out. I hate my life. I wish I was a matador or something.

Twenty-ounce Dos Equis Ambers for $3.25 during happy hour. Chips are served warm. The guacamole is a delight.  If you're an enchilada sauce aficionado, they've got a red sauce that's out of this world. I had a dish called....well, fuck me runnin...I forget now. Anyway, its a braised pork dish topped with enchilada sauce, red or green.   Lots of tv sets to watch sporting events.  Booths are comfy and the server was extremely pleasant, as if she actually enjoyed her job. Now there's a novel concept. The hostess was dizzy but nice.   Overall, this is a pretty decent experience when White Chocolate Grill is up to its gunwales in Scottsdale douche-nozzles waiting (60-90 minutes)  for a table.  Last time I ate at Blue Agave my banker brought me here to end our relationship. That was 2009.  Four years and one great recession later, BAMC is still in business. Kudos to BAMC for surviving the great recession.   As it relates to my former banker, I hope she's now homeless and no longer has access to feminine hygiene products, or even soap and water for that matter.  And, vinegar too.  A fitting salute for that stinky lending-whore.

I remember when LC opened their first place on 21st and Van Buren. The food was magical, the prices, even more so.  Last week I stopped in for one of my old favorites, their green chile burrito.  I was sadly disappointed. In an investigative effort to learn why I had yet to bite into a piece of meat, I surgically opened my burrito, spilling its contents out onto my plate.  It was like the shark autopsy scene from Jaws sans the license plate.  I wasn't expecting the little Kintner boy to come spilling out, but rather, hoping for a few pieces of meat to go along with the green chiles.  I counted 4 pieces of meat. As I said, this was a huge letdown given my carnivore emeritus status and all.   Three weeks ago, I visited their Missouri and 7th location for a bowl of Menudo, since they've always made it better than most. It was a huge letdown as well.  Overpriced and with more hominy than tripe, the service was poor too.  Other than buying their LaCanasta tortilla chips at our local grocers, I won't be going back anytime soon.

At some point it becomes academic as you find yourself in a "Oh, my god, you HAVE GOT TO TRY THIS" pissing contest with your spouse over who ordered best.  You want her envious.  You want her to say those sweet sounding words, "I should have gotten what you ordered...what was I thinking" firmly putting you back on top in the who knows best department. At least when it comes to Mexican food. Sadly however, her meal is equally as good.  You've got nothing. Fuck.  The smug little smirk and shrug saying; "Yeah, well, I tried to tell ya" will have to wait for another day, another restaurant.  Damn you LaCanasta for being so good.

WIth the dubious honor of being the only place in Arizona selling the Nespresso espresso maker, (akin to the Keurig, only for espresso), I attached bells to my Brooks running shoes and went in to finally see what all the fuss was about. This after listening to my NY friends brag about their Nespressos.  Salesperson:             "How strong do you like your espresso?"  Me:   "Well, you know....strong. It's espresso, right?"  Salesperson"            "Oh, that's where you're wrong...it's not just espresso. It's Nespresso!             I'm going to suggest we start you off with a number five. You'll like it.             It has strong hints of cocoa, but mildly oaky."  Me:    "Huh?" Hey, listen lady, I just wanted to try an espresso...ok?"  Salesperson:               "Totally get it. You're not messing around here I can see.. Let's try number eight              shall we? It's robust with lots of depth and an aftertaste you're going to               simply love. It's slightly earthy however but I think that may be what you're               what you're looking for.  Me:     [Being super witty]   "Jesus."

Next time you go to Circle K and it's busy...the cashiers swamped with lines three deep...I have a challenge for you.  Go to the hot-dog grill and take a small bite out of each hot-dog...placing the partially eaten dog back onto the grill.  Count up how many dogs you've just ruined before the cashier looks your way or someone approaches.   I'm guessing my record of eleven still stands, but who knows. You may be the next champion and not know it.  Now get in there and let's see what you're made of.  Note: If you beat eleven, please contact me and I'll pass the crown and sceptre.

It's a hot summer's day and you're in the neighborhood. You're broke as usual, sweating your stones off, and now, your car's air conditioner has picked this moment to go code blue on you.  Stop everything and duck into Costco, where you can get a chocolate vanilla swirl frozen yogurt for only 65 cents. It's really $1.30, but the price goes down after making your girlfriend pony up her 65 cents,  It gets better. When they see how pathetic the two of you are, standing there, asking to split a 1.30 cup of yogurt, which by the way is about the same size as a red solo cup, they'll fill both of them nearly to the top!  Important note: You will need to muster a reasonably sad expression...kind of like Emmet Kelly or something. Summer relief in a solo cup!

I don't go to Starbucks anymore. I used to, but I got sick of walking in and having all the 'cool' people, sitting with their Macs, sipping their caramel soy fuckwad machiato Americanos giving me the once over as if i'm a bigfoot sighting or something.    It's a real joke.  I walk in and all the sneaky laptop whores quickly steal a furtive glance at my distressed fashion and shake their heads, signaling I don't belong here. Not like this. Not with them...all dressed-up and ready for work.   They probably don't know, or rather, how could they know I live next door. And how easy it is to roll out of bed, pillow perm and all, dressed like a major buttmunch as I wander in half asleep for my morning espresso, costing me around three bucks.  I never did get this. If taking a laptop with you to Starbucks is so vital to your existence, how is it you're so easily distracted each time the door swings open and the bell rings, heralding the arrival of a new, and potentially off the charts beautiful person, you pretentious douchebag! So anyway, who needs that shit, right?  No more Starbucks.   Instead, I bought a Keurig coffee maker. The one that uses those little K-cups. Only the K should stand for kablastafucked since the price of a K-cup is somewhere just south of a Bentley Continental GT convertible.  And this is why I go to Costco. This Costco in particular. You can buy a box of fifty-four Starbucks K-cups,  their Verona blend for only 36 bucks.  Buy them anywhere else and you'll pay double.  So now I sit and bang out Yelps on my laptop as I drink my morning Starbuck K cup....not a pretentious douchebag anywhere in sight.  Well, except for me of course.  Note: 54 K cups lasts me close to a month. That's 36 bucks for the entire month.  I used to spend that in a week at Starbucks while getting judged in the process.  No more.

We all make mistakes, its part of being human. Only some people learn from their mistakes while others don't.  Well if you know someone in your neighborhood like this, one of those priceless Darwinian gems whose mugshot routinely shows up on the 10 o'clock news, the guy or girl who you suspect is selling dope to all the kids on your street, I strongly urge you to recommend this place to them.   Not because I want to gawk at them in the next booth. I don't. And not because I think they deserve DVA restaurant's outstanding breakfast and lunch specials. They don't.  It's because this place draws law enforcement officials like shit draws flies. And they don't even sell donuts!

I've never used the cumulative points system to review a place, not until now.  Here goes nothing.  Three stars for the ample parking in front of their plate glass front window, allowing you to watch as a group of bangers eyeball your car.   Minus three for the multiple magazine racks blocking the entrance, all of which advertising pretty, young, Latina escorts who will change your life. (not in a good way).  One for the salsa bar.   Three for the food. I had number eleven, the Machaca plate. Seven bucks...pretty tasty and a ton of it.  Minus five for the men's bathroom..where it appears that at some point in its bathroom lifetime, death went in there and died.  Add two more for the server, whose Sharpie'd eyebrows resembling a surprised clown make you chuckle to yourself.  Another for her tits.  A star for your bravery, coming to South Phoenix in the first place.  Another for the 19" tv in the corner broadcasting Mexican soccer.  Minus three for the loud Mexican tunes blaring from what sounds like car speakers.  And five for the tres leche cake dessert. A must try.  Oddly, that somehow adds up to six.  Something is seriously wrong with this method.

In keeping with the traditional Mexican cure for hangovers, I came here for a bowl of menudo Saturday morning.  For you non-menudo eaters, (myself included) I'm not sure how a bowl of cow's stomach is supposed to cure one of those hangovers where you can't bend over to tie your shoes for fear your eyeballs will pop out, but they say it works so I gave it a try.  It didn't work. It was tasty and all, but I left every bit as hungover as when I went in.  Leading me to believe the real cure for a hangover isn't so much the menudo itself, but rather the idea that you're eating something so disgusting and repulsive, you're just happy to get it over with. Lending to the idea of feeling better afterward. You don't though.   Anyway, you've probably eaten things far worse than a bowl of spiced cow innards.... on a Saturday morning...while waiting for the cab to show up.  Not repeating. (either one)

Do you shop for groceries at Fry's?  If so, you really do owe it to yourself to visit this location. It's called Fry's Mercado and it's all that.  Upon entering, you feel something is amiss - as if someone should have checked your passport at the entry.  Shake it off.  Go check out the produce section to your immediate right.   Veggie bins unlike any Fry's you've ever visited.   A typical Fry's produce section features many veggies all crowded together on one  long cooler bin. This store has bins of veggies - four by eight feet long with only one type of veggie in each bin - piled so high you can't reach the top. Three alone dedicated to various types of chiles. And you know how your Fry's might have three or four mangos?  This place has a bin of mangos. Hundreds. Same with tomatillos, green chiles, serranos, onions and tomatoes. In fact, the tomato bin is the biggest I've ever seen, short of a semi truckload coming straight off a farm.  Let's move on. The deli.  You're not going to find typical deli salads or boar's head meats here. Here you'll find entire sheets of pig skin deep fried. Yes, the entire skin of a pig fried whole and hanging behind the glass counter. Deep fried pork shoulder is another delicacy. In fact, everything here is deep fried.  Look around and pick something for lunch. Hope you like grease.   Now go sit and wait for your number to be called. And wait and wait and wait. Then, as you go to complain about the wait, you realize they've been calling out the order numbers in Spanish. Shit. You look at your ticket - forty two. You were listening for forty two english, not cuarenta y dos (spanish).  Your food is now cold. Shit again.   Let's move on to the tortillarilla, shall we? This is where you can watch as they make fresh tortillas of every shape and size, corn, flour, and whole wheat.  And while you're doing all this, enjoy the in-store music system loudly broadcasting mariachi tunes.   On your way out, you'll marvel at the check cashing area; A wall of plexiglass - the kind you see in prison movies where a guy in an orange suit is on the other side talking to some investigator on a phone.   If none of what I've described is enough reason to visit, here's one more.   Cases of bottled water for 2.79.  I can't even buy a gallon of gas for that.    Note: If you're worried about whether or not your car will be where you left it, don't. They have a guy in a golf cart with a sign labeled 'Security' who routinely patrols the parking lot.  Try this place. It's like going to Mexico without all the fuss of a passport - or dysentery.

Living in Phoenix means I don't have to wear deodorant seven months of the year. The other five, there's not enough deodorant in the world to cover my pit stank.   This is why I go to Walgreens. At Walgreens, I can buy Dial antibacterial bar soap, go home, shower, and while doing so, pretend like I'm a surgeon scrubbing in for a major procedure. Only instead of scrubbing my hands, I do my pits with this stuff.  The result.  I don't have to use deodorant in the summer either. And, no pit stank! Try this, you'll be surprised how well it works.  So much so, you'll find yourself freakishly sniffing your pits throughout the day in curious disbelief. It's glorious.   Note: Be careful your co-workers don't catch you huffing your pits in public or else they'll think something's wrong with you.

Phone voice:  "Are we celebrating any special occasion this evening?"  Me: "Uh, yeah. We're both still alive and haven't killed one another after all these years."  Phone voice:  [cute giggle]  Ok, we'll see you both at seven, byeee."  Service, ambiance and food, the entirety of this event was perfection. But the best part, the coup de gras was our server delivering a dessert neither of us had ordered.  Atop this lovely bowl of creme brulee were beautiful, bright red sliced strawberries and a lone candle, shimmering with light against the darkened enclave where we sat.  Puzzled, and before we could indicate we hadn't ordered dessert....  Server: "We here at Donovan's are totally glad you two are still alive"   Fun night. Right up to the point where I had to explain why Donovan's staff brought us a free dessert. Thanks Donovan's, I think?

Busted on RedTube again? You can't help it.  Having a penis, as one comedian put it...."is like having a friend who always wants to come out and play." You're not a perv, but tell her that. Like she's going to believe anything you say right now.  Well my friend, the playground has officially closed, and there's only one way to get it back open...flowers and chocolate. I know, its cliche, but chicks really do eat that shit up.  Florists? Forget it...they're a rip. Conventional grocery stores? Great if you want to get her something that looks like you stole it off a grave marker.  Trader Joe's is your best bet. For $5.99, you can get a floral bouquet guaranteed to get the playground open for business again, and in short order too! The chocolate bars are only $1.99, I recommend several.  While you're at it, grab a bag of TJ's movie popcorn when you're there, you'll need it for the movie you're going to watch with her later.  When you get home, whip out the flowers and chocolate, while you proceed to scroll through the DirecTV listings and queue up a flick. Wait.. WHAT ARE YOU DOING???  Didn't you learn ANYTHING?  Change the channel to The Notebook you idiot, and get Black Beaver Bang 11 out of the queue right now!  Do I have to tell you everything? Jesus!

My new diet plan requires I eat like a hyena on the Serrengetti.  Meat. And lots of it.  One teensy problem.  I don't like meat.  But then I also don't like the idea of my looking like an old man poolside this summer, my swimsuit hiked up to my nips.  For this reason, I choose TJ's as part of a sensible weight loss plan. In the frozen food section, you can get a 360 calorie portion of Lamb Vindaloo for a few bucks and voila, banana hammock, here we come.  With any luck, I should be down to a svelte 250 in no time. Or, I suppose I could always get a metric scale, where I'd trim down to 115 overnight.  Nah, go get the Lamb Vindaloo.

On days when my Lexapro/Wellbutrin cocktail isn't working, before frantically searching through my wife's popular hiding places for shotgun shells, I take a deep breath and come here: Wal-Mart Supercenter, where I normalize - using its patrons as sort of a wellness gauge.   I walk in battered and bruised from the rigors of everyday living, Chief Raincloud if you will, and within minutes, sashay out like an animated Disney character replete with Bluebirds swarming wildly about my head and shoulders. Yes, customers  who frequent the Wal-Mart help me to understand how my life really isn't all that fucked-up after all. Thank you Wal-Mart.  And THANK-YOU, all you societal asswarts!

Years ago, old man Hobe taught my parents how to cook rib roasts.  "In the morning, bring the roast to room temp...heat the oven to 500 degrees, cook the roast for one hour at 500, turn the oven off, and let the roast sit in the oven all day long" he explained.  A couple weeks ago while watching Food Network, I saw one of the chefs offer up the exact recipe, implicitly stating it was his latest greatest cooking technique. Wrong. Old man Hobe had it right years ago, and for that, I'll forever sing his praises.  The shop was sold many years ago, and has since changed hands a couple times, but little has changed.  Maybe it's not feasible to shop here all the time due to it's proximity, but it's definitely worth your while to experience this butcher shop every now and again when you're in the area.  The butcher shop. Fast becoming a relic in the American landscape...unless you go to South Phoenix where there's a Carneceria on practically every corner.

This place is one of the last few originals in Phoenix, dating back to the 1920's. Its a no-nonsense steak house serving up some of the best steaks in town, and at half the price as places like Mortons, Maestros or Harris.  If you like beef and a cold beer, mosey on in for one of the best views in Phoenix from an old ranch house.  I've never been disappointed here.  Well, one time, when I got so drunk my date left me in the parking lot and drove off with my jeep.  She did call me the next day to tell me where I could pick it up, so it wasn't all bad.  Bitch.

I had lunch here today and quickly became of fan of this eatery.  Service was quick and friendly and the food was noteworthy,  I had the roasted veggies with a quinoa side salad, which, if you know anything about quinoa, you know it takes some creativity to bring this lonely little starch to life.  Well, similar to the bride of Frankenstein, not only did they bring the quinoa to life, they used a dressing that gave it the personality of Liberace on Ecstasy! No shit! My wife had the red wine braised beef sandwich, which when dipped in the horseradish cream sauce, produced a mouth orgasm similar to those tantric 8 hours orgasms Sting is always bragging about.  So thats it. A quinoa salad that practically jumped off the plate, singing broadway show tunes like Michigan Frog, as my wife shuddered uncontrollably with every bite of her beef sammy.  I presume she wasn't faking it either since no mercy bites were offered after finishing my meal in record time.

Do you like crusty french bread? Hard crusty shell on the outside with soft, moist chewy crumb on the inside?  Whenever my wife makes soup, she asks me to bring home a loaf of crusty french bread. This is where I go to get it. Don't get me wrong, all their food is delicious, especially the veggie lasagna, and some kind of melted goat cheese in spaghetti sauce appy, but I don't have time for that, not tonight. My orders were very specific, "a loaf of crusty french bread."  When you arrive, there'll be a couple dozen loaves of bread for sale in the front area, across from the hostess station. Grab a loaf, take it home and when you walk through the door, hold it up to your crotch and pretend its your junk.  A hybrid, somewhere between a baguette and a traditional french loaf, you'll look like Ron Jeremy with this thing.  Go ahead. Wave it around. Maybe even do 'the helicopter' with it, signaling your after-dinner intentions transcending any level of naughty she's even vaguely familiar with.   Then prepare to eat your soup by yourself after getting a lecture on holding up any and every phallic shaped object to your crotch, as if it was some gigantic dong.  Keep on dreaming, my friend.  The world needs dreamers like you.  Note to St. Francis management Your bread is remarkable, and that little quinoa salad is scrumptious. Nice job!

I'm rarely surprised anymore when going out to eat but Picazzo's was one of them. We had two greek salads and were shocked when we saw the portion size as it was piled high on the plate. Even more shocking was the conspicuous presence of all the little goodies....plenty of olives, tomatoes, and brimming with feta.  I spent the extra buck or two, opting for chicken. Not a few pieces but practically an entire chicken breast.  I'm rarely satiated after eating salad for lunch but this was one of the few exceptions. Everything about this place was good if not great.  Friendly host, waiter, good food and plenty of it, and low prices. One of our faves.

This review was posted over a year ago, however, it was removed by Yelp HQ only last week. I'm reposting it after making some minor modifications, mainly since the response and comments were so positive.... by everyone except Yelp HQ.   Whole Foods Market. Ladies, you're young and vibrant...today.  But as the years drag on, you notice changes. Subtle changes, such as:  *crow's feet *saddlebags *sagging butt and or tits,  *and orange skin from all the tanning products, your complexion now resembling that Louie V handbag you've been toting your Shitzadoodle around in.  You've got a choice to make.  Spend all your money now on organic, free range shit, this in an effort to remain healthy looking, or, shop for a lot of the same stuff at Costco, where you can load up, get twice your money's worth, and have a shitload of cardboard boxes you won't have a clue what to do with.   But the real bonus will be how in only a few short years, you'll have saved enough money for a good plastic surgeon, which you're going to need anyway if you have any plans to remain living in Scottsdale for any length of time.  My opinion? I highly recommend the latter and here's why.  Scottsdale has a serious shortage of fish-lipped women with feline looking facial features, who routinely wear yoga pants telegraphing their hiked-up thongs.  Poor thong....how sad that your fate...to be cast to a fifty-something, saggy-butt host. Ladies, is that what you want? To idly standby, watching, as the ranks of this bass-cat looking oddity dwindle in population? I didn't think so.  The choice is yours. Beautiful and broke from shopping at Whole Foods today. Or, aging not so gracefully with the help of medical science, an overzealous plastic surgeon, and Victoria's Secret, which I assure you with one of her thongs in yoga pants will be anything but.  A lot of good all that free range organic crap did.   If you do come here, try the hot deli, where you can get every kind of ethnic food, save for Ethiopian. It helps after a late night at work, on your way home, when you don't feel like eating fast food. They also have a taco and pizza bar, fresh bakery, and a smoked meats section where you can get some of the worst barbecue and smoked meats I've ever tasted.  The only thing I'll recommend in this place other than the hot deli, is the chocolate and coffee bar, which seems to have a ton of delights that are supposedly good for you.  I doubt it.

Here's my theory on the enchirito.  Bob, the marketing director at Taco Bell was someplace else that day, a million miles away as he pensively doodled at his lunch, fork in hand.   He had an ominous task ahead of him...come up with a new product and fast! After all, It had been some number of years since he and the team jackpotted-out with that seven layer burrito. He needed something new.  Something different.  Time slipping away, he continued to mindlessly needle at his lunch...on this day a number two; the enchilada and bean burrito. And that's when destiny came calling.   Holy Shit he thought to himself, snapping out of his daydream. I think I have something.           "Wait a second....somebody..SOMEBODY RUN AND GET ME A PAD AND           SOME PAPER...I'VE GOT SOMETHING, THIS IS BIG PEOPLE, HURRY!"         Bob indeed had something. All that poking at his number two had managed to combine the burrito and enchilada into an unrecognizable mass, and that's when the gods, copulating at that particular moment, shot a wad of inspiration directly into Bob's uniquely undersized brain.             "We're going to call this...are.you ready... .THE ENCH-IRITO," he exlaimed           proudly to the marketing department.  There were cheers and wild applause from the team. They knew Bob just hit another jackpot as he had so often done in the past.   Well, you know the rest of the story, another star was born in the Taco Bell line-up. Way to go Bob. (and whoever ran after the paper and pen)   This is all just a theory, based on a set of postulates including a spork, beans, cheese, a tortilla, and an entire marketing staff, optimistic they'd hit another home-run without a Spanish speaking Chihuahua.  Tip: If you're sick of everything on the menu, try a bean burrito with green sauce. It's not on the menu but TB will make it for you just the same.   It looks like snot so don't look at it and get all freaked-out. Just eat it. It's tasty, kinda hot.

I've had the pleasure of using this facilty since it was built, and had I rated it on any of my past visits, it would have gotten 5 stars like many of the reviews you'll find here. Unfortunately, this is not the same Mayo Hospital as 2010 or earlier. Mayo, like every other business entity in today's economic environment is now demonstrating a particular focus on bottom line rather than patient care. I experienced this first hand last week during a two day procedure. Inquisitive, I asked several staff members what was going on, since the level of service had deteriorated so noticeably. I got the same response from nearly all I spoke with.  Mayo, in its efforts to fill all the beds has now started accepting most insurances, (a concept they turned their nose up at in the past) the result of which is an overly crowded hospital.  Due to the nature of my procedure, I was to stay overnight. I stayed overnight, but in a holding area instead of a room. Again, the nurses informed me there were simply no rooms available.  The result. Both my wife and my doctor were unable to locate me.  The nurses were not helpful and willfully disregarded the printed instructions given to my wife at check-in, (stating visiting procedures post-op). After several (4) hours of my frantic spouse trying to locate me, she finally was told she could not see me due to my not being accessible. My doctor was unable to locate me until 5 hours after the surgery at which time he blew up at the staff, (in my presence) informing them a room was necessary due to the extensive neurological testing required the next morning and how this could not be performed in a holding area.  The next day when I did come around, I found a nice bump on my head along with a nice cut on my face. I informed the nurse on duty but she deferred to the patient care rep who blew it off as a routine condition that regularly occurs in surgery, telling me the surgery table was cold and my head likely stuck to it. (like that explains the goose egg and cut)  The doctor was the best. The nursing staff was also top notch. It was the overcrowding, the panic they managed to instill in my family by not keeping them informed post operatively, and the dumb as hell patient rep whose ardent defense of the hospital only made her look stupid, and me contemptuous.  The Mayo has always been a top notch facility, but this visit proved anything but.  When you charge the prices the Mayo does, there's no excuse for the troubles we experienced. I, like the other reviewers, routinely recommended the Mayo as being the standard in ultimate patient care. Not anymore. I could have gotten this level of disappointment at the County Hospital.

Do you believe in Yin and Yang? The ancient Asian philosophy suggesting polar opposites are interrelated?  If you don't, then you best start believing in it if you're headed to Flo's.  The manifestation of Yin and Yang is clearly present...like 'in your face' present when you're here. You'll see it from the moment you're seated, but you need to be observant...in tune...at one with the universe. Look around. Notice anything?  Like the couple who was seated five minutes after you were. See how they're now eating something and enjoying their experience? And what's the opposite manifestation? Your Yin to their Yang? You guessed it.  You're boiling mad, no beverage, food or server anywhere on the horizon.  But don't be mad. Look for the zen in all of this. Try to think in terms of the great Yin and Yang.  Calm yourself by reasoning how you and your date actually sacrificed your good time  in order for another couple to be laughing, joking, eating, and now, sipping cocktails as part of their good time. This is the great balance in life.  Now you try. Go ahead..it's easy.    After dinner, when the bill comes, simply stiff the waiter on the tip. You'll be happy you did, and now, the waiter will be pissed off...just like you were throughout the dining experience. Yet another example of Yin and Yang. Beautiful, isn't it? Are you seeing the zen in all of this yet?  Oh, and one more thing. Despite your poor service, you'll find the food is really quite delightful.  Flo's really does provide the full Asian experience. Truly, the manifestation of Yin and Yang.  Kudos Flo!

Whether the food is good or bad, one has to appreciate a place where the owner all-too-conspicuously wanders about the dining area during peak times, visiting with the guests, monitoring the staff, and demonstrating her full control over the operation. I'm talking about Flo.  On a recent visit, this was the case as we watched Flo monitor her staff and patrons, disappearing from site every now and again, I presume to monitor the kitchen staff. She was like an Asian dust-devil!   The kung pao was a little too sweet for me, but to my delight, we also ordered the Vindaloo chicken....not so much vindaloo as curry, but the sauce was creamy and flavorful, making up for its lack of authenticity. Overall, both tasty dishes.  During our visit, a server dropped some glassware, sending it into a thousand broken pieces. Flo was right there to monitor the cleanup and insure no-one stepped on the glass.   I really appreciated the vigilance of Flo, as it demonstrates why she's been so successful....hard work and passion. Something you don't or practically never see in a chain restaurant or its staff.  Kudos Flo. Beautiful recovery from prior visits, making you my current top choice for Chinese.

Take-out sucked violently. Too much vinegar in the hot and sour soup, I felt like an old lady with yeast issues.  But what sucked the most was their new take-out containers; half the size of PF Changs and compartmentalized, like a tv dinner. In one compartment, the rice, entree in the other.  Think about it. What was once a white, four-fold container is now a cheesy two compartment container with half the food.  I'm out.

My doctor says I need more fiber in my diet, she says it's nature's broom.  I say my diet is just fine, relying on the more traditional staples, such as pink snowballs, fritos, and beer. I tell her it's not not exactly nature's broom, but it is janitorial in a sense, almost like a mop and bucket.   But the 'roids need to go or else there'll be an operation she says...one nvolving hot pokers and way too much probing for my liking. This is where CFA comes in handy.  They have a cole-slaw that's to die for, one guaranteed to promote a healthy colon, or at best, keep my proctologist's hands (and hot intruments) away from my precious bum, which has yet to break it's maiden with a hot poker or inquisitive finger.  So if you like cole slaw, and your doctor orders you to eat fiber, this is the answer to your... prayers? You'll be crapping like a sick barnyard animal in no time.  Go CFA cole slaw!!!  Woo Woo, [fist pump]

From where I live in North Scottsdale , it's forty seven miles to this place, taking over an hour to get there. The line, like Disneyland's Pirates of the Caribbean. And by the time I got lunch, it was two o'clock. One star for my crew for talking me into this.  I find a large table, underneath some very old and very beautiful tamarack trees.  I don't like that I'm sharing a table, seated next to some fat kid with ice-cream sundae all over his mug who won't shut up.  Then the ominous sign posted on the tamarack tree limb we were seated beneath, which is about five feet off the ground and growing perpendicular to it.      "WARNING: WATCH FOR FALLING SCORPIONS FROM TREE LIMBS"  Another star and mega props to Joe's for not only having a farm and a restaurant, but an interactive poisonous insect exhibit as well.  And finally, on the walk back to the car, we (as in my wife) noticed a plot of land across the street where you can rent a thirty by thirty plot for your very own garden. Another star for my wife now wanting me to plant a veggie garden next weekend.  I'm hungover, driving for over an hour listening to Adele on repeat, (because we haven't heard 'Someone like you' one million times yet) standing in line wanting to puke, nervously watching for suicidal scorpions as I eat my burger and fries, listening to some brat I'd like to smack the bejesus out of, and my wife tells me I'm planting a garden next weekend.  Yeah, no....I won't repeat.

You've heard of their existence for years now, although you've never actually seen one...kinda like Bigfoot. Churchgoers. Well they're here and apparently, the word is out because this place has a bevy of them on Sunday mornings...causing you to wait thirty or so minutes before claiming your table.  It'll be worth the wait however. Try the muesli pancakes with a side of bacon. After wolfing the delicious cakes, it's time to have some fun with the bacon. It'll be dry enough to crumble,  making it easy to fire through your straw. Your target?  The churchgoers. More specifically, their women...seeing how many pieces of crumbled bacon you can launch into those weird-ass bouffant hair-do's without anyone ever noticing.  Think of it as getting even for snaking your table when the hostess announced "Smith...party of two."  You always weasel the Smith table.  What was THEIR problem anyway?

Normally, I wouldn't be caught dead in a place like this. And if it wasn't for my poor sleep habits, I'd have never found this place.  Oversleeping at least a couple days a week has now found me using the HOV lane a little more than I care to admit. This is where Fascinations helped.  Stephanie Swift Love, a blow-up doll, now escorts me to work each day, allowing me to hit the snooze button without regret.  I strongly recommend that if you do go this route, choose Stephanie over the other dolls. She looks realistic except for her mouth being propped open.  Just pretend it's your wife yelling at you.   It also helps to dress her in something fashionable. Like a cute Jumper, with matching bra and panties. Renaming her helps too. She goes by Destiny.

I've found that sex, in the immortal words of Maude Lebowski, can be a zesty enterprise. But I think Maude was referring to two people having sex - not one.  And that's why you would come here.  I chose Fascinations to pick up my HOV lane buddy: Stephanie Swift Love and boy was I right to do so. I was fascinated by their countless dildo offerings. I know and have met plenty of dildos throughout my lifetime, but never have I seen such a fine array as this place has to offer. I guess I'm out of touch - having always taken the manual approach to lovemaking - but I can see where some might like this kind of stuff.  For example: Did you know they have a dong that not only vibrates, and, has a jack-hammer mode? It's guaranteed to bust your business into a million orgasmic pieces. Seriously, these things can rub the paint right off of your junk in seconds flat.   Anyway, I thought I'd update since I won't be going in there for anything else for a while, not unless Stephanie develops a leak.

Let's say you're driving down the road with an extra twenty bucks you don't know what to do with.  You're hungry, it's lunchtime, and you come here.   King's Fish House  Where you can get an entire glob of tuna fish smeared between two slices of whole wheat bread. An artful creation resembling something your eight year-old niece would throw together, this along with a fistful of french fries and some bitter-as-gall deli slaw, and all for surrendering that dirty twenty! Actually it's 10.95 but with the diet coke and the tip, you're now up around twenty.   Other delights our party sampled were from the "Fried" section.  The menu description only reading Farm Raised Mexican Shrimp. It didn't say how these little Mexican Shrimp numbered only four.  Or how they must've been raised in one of the Kennedy's swimming holes in the Hampton's where they were fed fois gras and cavear, sipped champagne from gold-rimmed flutes, and had their own nanny, wistfully lulling them to sleep each night with old Raffi tunes.  Because at 13.95 for four of these little bastards, they must've led one pampered life on that farm!  Three of us. Two tuna fish sandwiches. And one small school of Mexican Shrimp, a water, a diet coke and an iced tea....48.95, with ten bucks for the tip, almost sixty bucks.  Unless you're dining on the company expense account, or someone else is picking up the tab, theres no reason on earth to pay twenty bucks for a tuna fish sandwich and a diet coke.  Or for that matter,  watch your friend eat  four of the Kennedy's prized pets.

Are you uncomely? A frightful excuse for a human? I am. And that's precisely why I come here to eat.  Much akin to how the human body is unable to discern hunger from sleep deprivation, so goes it with the waitresses at IHOP, routinely confusing my beastly cast with old age.  "Will you be ordering off of our Club 55 menu today?" her inflection almost shrapnel-like and every bit as piercing.  "Why yes...yes I will be, thank you very much."                   I can get a three-egg omelette with two fillings and two pancakes for $5.79. A glass of water and a twenty percent tip and I'm out the door for under seven bucks, and all without a visit from the manager. Cool, eh?  Anyways, if you're a hi-miler like me, or, you're just plain homely, give IHOP a try. It also helps if you're devoid of any normal levels of shame and guilt. Black stretch socks, flip-flops, an oversized Ed Hardy shirt and New Balance Cross Trainer's also play a vital role.  Cross Trainer's...yeah, right.

Dear La Piazza al Forno  We need to talk. I don't quite know how to say this so I'm just going to come out with it.  I've been seeing someone else.  How long? About a year now.   Am I in love with another? Yes.   Was it me?  It was.  The day you decided to remove hoagies from the lunch menu, about a year ago,   I'm sorry, but it really was you...and not me.  Hey..wait...put down that pizza peel...try to stay calm...please? [Olive oil container whizzing past head]  Please!  Stop throwing shit at me...everyone breaks up on social media these days, or haven't you heard.  Wow, what a Bitch!

Some think the term "It is what it is" is stupid.  I think the saying " I hate fish that tastes fishy" is stupid.  Especially when the person saying it  just happens to be the Summer's Eve poster child and coincidentally, your date for the evening.  I've eaten here since they opened, trying everything on their menu at one time or another, even some things not on the menu.  If you don't see the cedar planked salmon on the menu, ask for it.   You'll never tell another soul how you don't like fishy fish again after eating this salmon...it's the most un-fishy-est, yet fishy-est fish fish dish you'll ever eat.  If that makes any sense.  You do however have your date to contend with afterwards. Or did you forget? Oh well. It is what it is.

From the outside, Lucille's has the genteel charm of a building you'd find somewhere in the south, like New Orleans. Inside, the ambiance and decor match her exterior; warm and hospitable.   If only the food was good.  I tried the barbecue chicken sandwich, it came with a choice of many sides...I selected the collard greens. Typically, when one goes to a barbecue joint, ordering the bbq chicken sandwich, the expectation is a large bun with shredded barbecued chicken piled high atop one of the buns. Not here.  Oh there's a large bun alright, but it's there for all the wrong reasons...serving as camouflage for what it's concealing.  At first blush, it looks large and delicious, but if you're a food sleuth like me, you'll want to inspect its contents.  Here are the results of my examination.  Removed top bun. Removed the kale leaves and glob of fried shoestring onions that gave it all its height. Huge disappointment, no chicken in plain sight. Only a large glob of melted cheese. Removed the cheese to find, and this is no exaggeration, a thin piece of chicken breast with a little barbecue sauce puddle it was swimming in. The size of the breast was approximately 2 x 2-1/2 inches, or roughly a third the size of the bun it was sitting in.  Try to imagine this.  This was like the motherlode of all things deceptive.   When I want a barbecue chicken sandwich, I want a huge glob of chicken slathered in sauce on a large bun.  Not the kind of false hope Lucille's is serving up.   Not going back. But I will admire the architecture as I cruise the parking lot. Lucille's sucks balls.

You spent the afternoon day drinking when you should have stayed home and done your laundry. Now you're going to pay the price.  Mastro's offers a unique dining experience rivaled by few restaurants with its over the top food, ambiance, and service.  In fact, I doubt few can take exception with any aspect of this fine establishment.  It's simply that good.  If what you're seeking is a place where you can dress to the nines, be seen by Scottsdale's elite, frittering the night away in elegant surroundings, Mastro's is the place for you. A steak is around fifty bucks, a potato eleven, but in its defense, it is a one-pound spud that'll feed the entire table. Other notables were the lobster bisque, chopped salad, grilled buttered brussels sprouts, and scalloped potatoes.   Steaks are normal sized and easy to wolf. The ahi is thinly sliced and layered, presented in the size and shape of the entire fish. In a word, huge. This entree will feed two adults handily.   As mentioned, all of us were burnt crispy from an afternoon of prodigious day-drinking, making cocktails, wine, and aperitifs forbidden. The portions of starters were big enough to feed the Cardinal's front line, making dessert out of the question too. In fact, now that I think about it, I have no idea why we came here. Everyone was tired, grumpy, and ready for bed before the server even introduced herself. And, since I didn't stay home to do my laundry like I should have, I found myself wearing an old pair of ill-fitting jeans (tight would be an understatement) that squeezed my guts so badly, I could have leveled the entire scene with a lone weapons-grade fart sortie.   Four hundred bucks for an elegant evening of food I wasn't in the mood for, people watching I could have done without, and a drive home that'd make Jack Kerouac's journey seem like a jaunt out to the mailbox; this as I squeezed back a stomach full  of angry heaters the entire ride.   I'll be back, but next time it won't be because it was the only place we could locate  with early enough reservations to insure none of us passed out in our salads.

I like Irish people. Sober Irish people that is. Drunk Irish people, not so much, unless they're in O'Donoghue's on a weekend night, trashed, and dancing to some 'Flogging Molly' type live band. It's a hoot. Like watching gypsies performing some kind of ritual before killing a goat or something. Try it, you won't be disappointed.   Only don't make the mistake I did.  Try not to use phrases like 'Magically delicious' when addressing them.  They don't like it when you imitate that little leprechaun guy from the Frosted Lucky Charms commercial.  As good at dancing as they are, you'll find out in a hurry they're even better at fighting.

You're enchanting.  Someone with a certain je ne sais quoi...call it aplomb.    Your friends know you as the life of the party. The 'crazy' one. The one who takes all the risks and always comes out the better for it.   Well if this is you. And you've yet to succumb to death in any number of odd ways.  If you're the type who can ingest a couple hits of LSD, drink a bottle of Johnny Walker Black, and drawing on your Catholic school years, recite the Catholic mass in it's entirety at a Mexican beach resort. Have I got the perfect place for you.   O'Donogue's Pub.  Here is where you can 'put on the dog' as all of elite Scottsdale looks on.   Start with a shot of MIdleton's Irish whiskey. It's cost around fifteen bucks a shot but worth every penny.   This is no ordinary whiskey folks. This tastes like the glistening sweat from a nubile  young...[record scratch]  sorry, the Midleton's.  It's much too expensive to get cronked on, you'll need to alternate with Irish Car Bombs and Guinness 'pints'.  One problem.  The pints take f.o.r.e.v.e.r to pour, since O'Donoghue's insist's on using all of the 119.5 seconds its maker recommends while pouring. For this reason, you'll need the bombs and shots to fill in.  If you've never tried this, I highly recommend this triumvirate of drinks.  Quite simply, their majesty is untouched by lesser drinking combinations, paring much the same way as does a fine Bordeaux with a Filet au Poivre and a side of bernaise.  Trust me on this one.   To wit, when properly consumed, and in the order recommended, the car bomb, Guinness and Middleton make for a deliciously fun afternoon. Laughs. Practical jokes. Darts that never seem to find their target.  And those Scottdale elites, looking on in horror and disbelief that anyone could get this drunk on a Tuesday night.  Suffice to say, you'll have so much fun, when you leave and one of your friends insults your truck's towing capacity by suggesting it isn't mildly capable of dragging someone's open windowed Camry from the Fry's parking lot over to the Starbucks drive-thru, where you'll leave it for dead, you'll take that wager!  After all, you're that special someone.  The one with all the je ne sais quois....assholiness in this case.  Note: To the owner of the late model red Camry in the Fry's parking lot...I hope we didn't fuck-up your car too badly. FYI, we did use a nylon tow strap wrapped around your rear axle, so there shouldn't be any damage to speak of.  If there is, it was my buddy Dave's idea. (and bet)  I didn't actually do any of the rigging....I just drove.  And, laughed. A lot. Anyways...sorry.

Even if I was one of those Ethiopian kids on infomercials, you know, those little dudes with fat tummies and flies circling about, I wouldn't eat here. I firmly believe the executive chef at More is devoid of taste buds. There can be no other explanation for why everything is flavorless. Why hell, even I know you can make anything tasty with an assload of salt and butter. Not this chef.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         How exactly does one fuck-up prime rib, or for that matter, white cake? I didn't think that was possible until now.  Anyway, I had the good fortune of gracing their trough recently, the result of an invitation to a wedding / reception. MORE does have a bar located at the west end of the building which helps make the food tolerable.  If you go, notwithstanding this review, I strongly urge you to smoke or drink something so potent, you're 'seeing things' prior to your binge.  I now know why the Roman Empire had vomitoriums located adjacent to the feasting halls. History came into focus after eating here.

I havent been to PV mall for many years since moving to north Scottsdale, so it was a surprise to see how run down the place is. The final straw for me was watching as a young man shook down a shopper in Dillards for bus fare.  Yes, panhandling in the main aisle in Dillards, but even more impressive was overhearing one of the salespeople explain to another salesperson "how it happens all the time and management doesn't do anything about it." I walked out of the store looking over my shoulder, thinking the panhandler was following me out after having made eye contact with him and seeing him do a quick turnabout in my direction. Who needs that shit. I will never go back to PV Mall....it IS the new Christown!  Shame on you Dillards management!

On most days, there's a radar cop posted-up right next to the patio here, shooting speeders on Thompson Peak Pkwy.  This is another reason I like to come here.  Watching exotic cars such as Lamborghini's and Ferrari's routinely racing down Thompson Peak while the cop sits there....blow dryer in hand, is somewhat entertaining.  It's especially fun when the cop lights off his motorcycle seat, practically having an orgasm each time he hears their fast-approaching roar. He's kind of like a kid on Christmas morning, his excitement level off the hook. Cops are weird like that.   Anyway, the draft beer is really good here, and if you sit at the bar, the service is really good too. Their grilled chicken sammy and sweet potato fries are a delight.  The people in here are a mixed bag, mostly 30-40 somethings who aren't as good looking as I'd like, but then I'm just another pretty lake. The fuck do I know.  If you sit on the patio to check out the cop, I hope you don't get stuck with the server who's all heroin-chic and gives off a creepy vibe. She's fun to look at, even more so to make fun of behind her back, but she really is a dizzy bitch.   I just order two at a time to cover for her long disappearances.

Are you a beer aficionado?  And by beer, I don't mean Michelob Ultra or any of those tasteless, flavorless low-calorie 'beers'. I'm talking about IPA's.  Those extraordinary flavorful, aromatic brews offering double the taste, aroma and  alcohol content of mainstream beers. Well Temple Bar is for you.   Here you'll find a new selection from Lagunitas, a seasonal selection named 'Lagunitas Sucks'. I had three mason jars of this fine spirited brew and got my dick knocked right into the dirt.  SPOILER ALERT: It doesn't suck but it does tend to knock dicks in the dirt.  Temple Bar also features some of the best wings I've ever had, but you won't find them on the menu. You'll need to ask for them by name; JT's Favorites.  Apparently, there's some guy in the kitchen named JT, or maybe Justin Timberlake wandered in one day and ordered his wings grilled, then deep-fried till crispy.  They were magical. I ordered them hot.  Big mistake, go with medium. Aside from being a culinary artist, JT, (if that IS his real name) is also a sadomasochist, taking ghoulish delight in making sure hot truly means hot.  Between the Lagunitas and JT's nuclear wings, my head exploded right on the spot.   This freaked-out other pub-goers and the staff, making an otherwise peaceful evening a dreadful folly.  As I lay there, my head in a million tiny pieces on the floor, I noticed my fellow patrons curiously asking the bartender what of this fatal combination? It wasn't long before heads were exploding all around me. All of us laid-out on the floor, gibbering messes, the lot of us.    Lagunitas Sucks and JT's wings. A fitting end to a fucked-up day at work.  If you like hot wings, good IPA's and free popcorn or, if you don't particularly care if your head explodes, I strongly recommend Temple Bar.

A vacationing wife, nothing to eat in the house, and a penchant for women in yoga pants - deliver me from evil, Amen.  "You really should try to eat healthy next week," my wife spouts while packing for her trip;  "Try Whole Foods on your way home from work."  What a mistake! I went in hungry and left horny. Jesus.  I highly recommend this place for any guy whose wife is out of town, is tired of cold pizza and beer for dinner, and, has an unhealthy affliction for women in sheer yoga pants.  I now know what the Lululemon lawsuit is all about.  Whoever filed the lawsuit is obviously not  a straight male with a vacationing spouse.

Imagine what it would be like to eat an authentic french dip sandwich....  A thin bread roll cooked to crusty, dark brown perfection in a brick oven, its crumb moist and chewy.  Beef that's neither chewy or fatty, nor with any hint of gristle.  Caramelized onions that add just the right amount of flavor. And all of this this topped with mozzarella cheese, delicious, authentic mozzarella cheese in the correct proportion to the meat...not so much as to create a chewy glob, yet enough to add even more flavor to an already delicious treat. Now add a flavorful au jus that doesn't rely on salt for its too too delicious taste. It's a fucking miracle this sandwich. A real life miracle.  I've never experienced a french dip as heavenly as Cefepino's, making me conclude how one day when I decide to fuck-it-all...no longer eating sensibly or exercising, I'm going to live out the remainder of my days eating these things until I swell like a tick, pop and keel over.  The service was highly attentive with a variety of new faces stopping by every few minutes to fill our glasses, wipe down the table between servings, or provide information relative to the menu choices. One of the servers even provided the background of the restaurant, which we learned has a long and storied history in Paris.  The house chianti paired splendidly with my minestrone and french dip. A small (quarter sized) ramequin of horseradish was also served with the meal, it was slightly creamed and had a mildly strong flavor, in a word, supreme. Overall, this was an extremely pleasant dining experience.  If you're a French bread aficionado and, you live in Phoenix Metro where you know there just aren't that many places to get hard crust, oven-fired breads, you have another option....Cafepino.  Cafepino in my opinion is definitely a standout in the lineup of mediterranean eateries here in Scottsdale.

Have you ever wondered why food scientists only put a laxative in Activia yogurt?  Couldn't they have just as easily put it in a Tombstone frozen pizza? WTF??? Or why not beer. I like beer. Even tortilla chips...but yogurt? Well fuck that.  I'd rather eat a bag of prunes than that slimy shit they call yogurt.   Anyway, my wife sent me here to pick her up some Activia, and being the ever curious  soul,  I sampled a spoonful.                  "Yecchhhhh.....Ptooey...Ptoo...Ptoo. Ugghhh."  It was so bad, I spit it out faster than a porn star who'd just been informed her last paycheck bounced....the slimy shit flying all over the room.   So maybe Activia wasn't for me.  What the fuck am I saying...I know it's not for me. Jesus. But who knows, maybe you're constipated and like yogurt.  Maybe it's for you.  I wish the Activia people would cut a deal with Hershey's and stick their laxative in a milk chocolate bar with almonds.  Or even Reese's pieces. I'd eat that.   Anyhow, if you need Activia and you live close by, you can get some here.

Among all the pie selections available on the planet, (hair notwithstanding), apple seems to be a favorite among many of us.  And for my money, there's no better place to get a delicious, grocery store apple pie than Aj's.  However, here's a useful tip should you decide to try one.  1. Never buy the large pie.  I've found the apple / crust ratio is less than optimal with its bottom crust often soggy and the apples too few.   2. The small pie, (app 6") features a thoroughly cooked crust along with a high apple content. Perfect for two people. But you'll need more than one.   3. Buy three.  One for your dinner. Since all you ate was a lousy bean burrito.  The other for around midnight, when you wake up and think, "fuuuuck was that pie ever good!", stumble into the kitchen and inhale it in one squirrel-cheek mouthful.  The third?  That one is so your spouse (or significant other) has something to go with her coffee in the morning without your getting bitched-out. Ordinarily, I'd blame the second pie's disappearance on the kids or the dog or something.  But the dog died last year and the kids are in college.

If I ever own another aircraft, I'll probably fly it from Scottsdale Airpark into Williams-Field Airport, hop in a cab and take the short drive down to the Olive Mill.  Otherwise, I'll just wait until I'm horny enough that I can be pleasant to my wife for the three hour duration it takes to drive from North Scottsdale and back.  Their vermouth soaked, garlic stuffed olives are the shit. So too are their many tapenades. QCOM also has an extensive menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner with their signature sandwich, an Italian with tapenade featured on Food Network's 'The Best Thing I Ever Ate'. It wasn't exactly all that, but it was good.  My wife received free passes to tour their facility and take the olive class. Well worth the time and trouble.  I know way more about olives than a person should, but that's cool.  I'm not sure I'll ever dazzle anyone at a cocktail party with my knowledge of the olive fly and its reproductive habits, but who knows, right?  PS. They also feature live music on most weekends.

The Herb Box has continued to wow from the time they were merely a small catering service way back when to today. The help is always friendly and attentive while the food is well above average.  The chicken pesto sandwich is a delight and is accompanied by a side of warmed sweet potato chips. A tropical iced tea and some chick in skin tight yoga pants sporting a camel toe bigger than an adult female rhino rounded out my lunch visit.   Ya gotta love DC Ranch Market street with its eccentric a-holes. Camel toe's kid was a major brat.   Bill was forty plus bucks with tip. I'm as full as a fat blue tick right now.  .

God or evolution? The age old debate is settled once and for all at Simon Restaurant.  I think this was by design, because to get here, you'll traverse two buildings, board two elevators, ride on two very long moving walkways (called sky tubes),  and go through dark twisting-turning hallways before finally locating the place.  You've just championed Darwin's theory; survival of the fittest.  Because no-one sporting a walker, cataract glasses, oxygen rig, or cane will dare attempt this long and arduous journey for fear of an untimely ending. Their fate? The first floor lunch buffet.   And yours?  Simon.  What's that old adage? "To the victor goes the spoils?" Well your long walkabout will not go unrewarded my friend, as you find yourself spoiled by the food, service and surroundings of this fine establishment.  The decor and its well appointed interior. The pool area, showcased through floor to ceiling glass walls.  Fashionistas everywhere, laughing, sipping colored beverages adorned with little parasols, acting as though nobody in the world matters but them.  Businessmen, in Armani suits. And the sun seekers  by the pool, wearing swimsuits fashioned only from a small length of colored thread.   Then there's the food. A pre-meal bread basket with pretzel and zucchini bread. A french dip sandwich so sumptuous, both its imagery and flavor will linger for hours. A tenderloin salad with all the usual accouterments, neatly compartmentalized to suit even the most anal of eating habits.  You've found the Mecca of Las Vegas eateries. It's about this time your wife asks you how you heard about Simon.  I suppose you could lie, explaining how you watched an Iron Chef America episode where Kerry Simon unmercifully beat Cat Cora into submission, but she'd know you  were bullshitting since you only watch shows like Pawn Stars and Hillbilly Handfishin'. Just tell her the truth for once.  You got bad directions to the mens room and wound up here. For once, she'll appreciate your uncanny sense of direction.

The only reason to give SR anything less than 5 stars would be if one was lactose intolerant. Otherwise, prepare to loosen that belt a couple notches and practice those deep breathing exercises they taught you in your Lamaze classes as you gobble your way to Ice Cream Nirvana. You'll also need a wheelbarrow and a pickup truck, and, someone to cart your bloated ass off the premises once you've "sampled" the various desserts.  Blinkers-the kind horses wear when racing- are also a good idea. Otherwise you'll find yourself ogling your fellow diners desserts, not wanting to wait for the next trip in to try them. These desserts are so good, if you were a shark for example, you'd launch into an uncontrollable eating frenzy where you'd not only eat all the desserts, you'd eat the tables and chairs, the soda fountain, and  your fellow patrons, perhaps even their vehicles.   This is an experience you should plan for, like a cruise or extended vacation.  So pack a bag, drive over to SR, and don't leave until the COPS film crew arrives to forcibly remove you from the premises. That is, if you dont have access to a pickup and wheelbarrow. If you do eat the other diners, go for an insanity plea, blaming it on their ice cream being crazy good.   Diego

If you like sweet frozen lactose treats, there are two ways to get them.  One is to pack your bags and head for the Arctic circle, hoping to meet some big Eskimo tundra-beast named Nukka Nukka, latch onto one of her semi-frozen titties when her creepy Uncle Nanook isn't around, and go hog-shit wild.   The other is Sweet Republic. Where you'll find lacto-centric creations designed for the Gods themselves.  The Food Network Gods that is.   Sweet Republic has created frozen desserts so sumptuous, they've actually been featured on the Food Network's " My favorite thing to eat."  And with good reason.  They use Madagascar vanilla in their cream, and caramel made from sugar crystals that were once Cinderella's tears.   I'm not a Food Network God, but I do know a thing or two about frozen treats. And until you've had a tasty delight from Sweet Republic, (or one of Nukka Nukka's whale-ishly lactating hooters) you simply haven't lived.

Dos Equis Amber drafts are two dollars on Tuesdays. They're 20 oz glasses. Allow me to Captain Obvious this for ya.  Seven glasses of this fine spirited brew, or approximately 140 ounces, (just a little over a gallon) will only cost you fourteen bucks, under twenty with the tip.  And you don't even have to wait until happy hour!  For me, this means a BAL somewhere in the 1.2 vicinity, or as I like to put it; legally fun.  For you, (my bragging little co-worker)  at 125 pounds and seven beers, you'll be a skosh higher than this, say around 3.25 and fast approaching legally embarrassing.  But you still have a few motor skills remaining and there are plenty of activities you can partake in at this BAL, such as:  *Spastic dancing on the concrete counter at the bar. *Flashing your tits at virtually no-one.  It's two in the afternoon.  *Being forcibly removed from the concrete counter prior to stumbling off the bar and into a stool.  This followed by:   *Telling me all about what a dick Jeremy is and how you should have never moved in with him. (I don't even know him) *Listening (uninterested) as you tell me your life story. (Cheerleader, yeah, right)  *Uncontrolled sobbing, followed by;  *Uncontrolled puking,.followed by;  *Passing out.  You also peed in the cab on the way home. Just thought you should know.  Next time you tell me how you're Italian, and how you can drink me under the table, you may wanna think twice. I weigh twice what you do. The nachos weren't such a hot idea either.  I hope you're reading this.

If you visit the Fry's at McDowell & 43rd avenue in Phoenix, you're in for a cultural treat. It's like walking into a grocery store in Mexico, complete with Mexican music bumping throughout the store, a deli featuring specialty food items such as sheets of fried pig skin, and a host of other odd-as-owl-shit foods only found in Mexico. And a greeter, just like WalMart, only he's blathering shit in Spanish as he pushes a cart your way.  The check-cashing area is a little troublesome. It's like a bank with counter-to-ceiling windows made of plexiglass about an inch thick...your only access to the teller through a small opening at the base of the window.   In the produce department, entire aisles of every type of chili pepper known to man.   Now, go to the Fry's on Hayden and Thompson Peak where you'll experience the polar opposite. Benz's and Beamers littering the parking lot. A Cold Stone and a Tully's coffee inside.  And a deli featuring stuff you'd find at a fancy restaurant.  But the most notable difference between the two stores is a full bar and wine room qt this location. This so you can have a couple beers while your wife does the shopping. The only thing missing is a flat screen. At the bar, you can sit and enjoy any one of a hundred craft beers or wines as you sample from the huge variety of cheeses.   The wine tasting room, large and well-appointed, similar to a cellar found in a mult-million-dollar home.  Fry's really has it right, catering to the different demographics.  Genius!  Kudos Fry's, I love your wisdom of not putting a bar in the 43rd location, where I doubt I''d make it to my car in one piece had you done so.

Total WIne is like a hobby shop for alcoholics.  I can find everything here including the hard to find RumChata. If you like good whiskey, they feature Midleton for thirty bucks less than other places. The wine and craft beer selection is enormous.   Sometimes, I only visit to look at all the vintage Bordeaux wines I can't afford as I fantasize about tunneling from across the way and hiring drug mules to steal them blind. Especially all their Petrus. And with all that Petrus, I'd have a sweet girlfriend too, maybe Jennifer Aniston.  And while I'm at it, I'd steal all their Cristal magnums as well. Then I'd ply Jen with the Cristal in the back of my F-150 and commence to motorboating her sweet hangers.  Sometimes, Jen and I would drink it right out of her Jimmy Choo stilettos. Then we'd go downstairs into my dad's basement and play Frogger on our old arcade machine. I almost always beat her.  She has no Frogger skills.  Five stars for Mexican Xanax. Five for Fireball. Five for Total Wine.  Five more for Jen. None if she happens to whoop me at Frogger.

I've been to plenty of dumps in my day, but this place is the shit! Used to be they'd make you unload in the actual landfill.   Well not anymore. Thanks to modern technology, there's a drive-thru warehouse you dump in. (I think they 'borrowed' the concept from Jack in the Box)  Anyway, you'll love this place.  Simply bring a copy of your water bill, show them a picture ID, and your girlfriends belongings will be forever a mystery.  Note: It does have a bit of an odor, but it's not as bad as the porta potty at work....the one where my ex-girlfriend said I got these crabs from.

If you have lunch plans and are thinking of picking up something fast, fresh and delicious out of their 'Easy to Go' deli case, do yourself a favor and go back out to the parking lot, pick up a hand full of dirt and weeds, and eat IT instead. You'll throw up either way, but at least you didn't pay 5.99 for it.  The Southwest quinoa and chicken salad was so old it was partially fermented. My bad for eating the shit. I thought it was some kind of unique 'Southwestern' dressing.  I don't even want my money back. I just want to tell anyone with two eyes, half a brain and can read english how messed up Fresh & Easy is.

The only reason to drink coffee is if I'm all stopped-up from my wife's pot roast. Otherwise I steer clear of coffee and caffeine related products.  Fortuitously however, I discovered another reason to like coffee, and did so at Starbucks yesterday. Their trenta sized cup.  It was a great Sunday dinner...pot roast as usual but now it was Monday morning and time to 'pay the piper'. I stopped at Starbucks on the way to work.  As bad luck sometimes has it, traffic was running slow that day...much slower than usual. I suspected something was wrong.  It was...the overhead freeway sign indicating a severe crash on the 51.  Great. I just drank thirty ounces of coffee and was now in the throes of a face-grimacing, bladder-busting event. This is where the thirty ounce cup came in handy.  Once filled with warm, steaming coffee, it was now filled with something equally warm and steaming.  Whether you like coffee or not, you'll enjoy the wide rimmed opening and the large capacity of the trenta sized cup.  It's able to contain even the most hearty of uncontrollable pissing events.   Way to go Starbucks trenta!

As it would happen, choosing The Mission as a place to pre-game the evening's events was the best decision my crew made all night. (For my sake's anyway).  There was the ambiance.... The ambiance here envelopes you, much like that first wave of warmth you get from a vicodin, scotch and Red Bull blast. In fact, this place is so warm and cozy, it'll make you feel like you're back in the womb flipping off the ultrasound technician.  The service... Perched at their communal high top, a long and double-sided table adjacent to the bar, our server was more attentive than a lion tamer with a big stick. This made it an absolute certainty I would lose the first of my five senses in a very short period...hearing. The weird thing about those communal tables is how you never know who you're going   to sit next to. Who do I get? A gaggle of what I can only conjecture were church ladies whom, at my merely uttering (90 decibels) the word 'FUCK', would violently, and in unison, snap their heads in my direction. Now this was fun. Yes, my prodigious cursing made for quite the theatrics as, with the same precision of Old Faithful, five heads would whip about on cue giving me the skunk-eye. What a hoot.  The Food.... The food was, well, I'm not sure. It looked and smelled good, but I was down to three senses by the time we finally ordered. Sadly, taste, much like Elvis, had left the building at that point. Good thing for our dates who were quick to inform us (routinely droning on throughout the meal) about how delicious everything was. (Blah Blah Blah)  The bill for four of us came to two hundred twelve dollars before tip. We had drinks, some very cool looking appetizers, enough chips and salsa to feed a small Ethiopian village, a bevy of drink, and some entrees whose names I couldn't remember if my life depended on it.  As I said, pre-gaming at the Mission was the best decision we made all night.  Who could ever know that with one well-timed (and perhaps highly audible) "FUCK", I held the awesome power to control my very own Women's Synchronized Scowling Team. For at least one night of my miserable existence, I WAS omnipotent.  Thanks Mission.

If you dutifully read all the reviews, one thing will be obvious.  Those who liked this place, liked the food, the ambiance and the service. Those who did not, cited things like slow service, overpriced, and not authentic. I suggest you dismiss the naysayers. I did and was pleasantly surprised.  In TT's defense, the server did explain how no item was pre-cooked and how each meal was made to order, subsequently, there would be a wait. If you have no problem paying for quality food, then you can dismiss overpriced as well. As for the food snobs who cite "not authentic", dismiss that as bull too. You can go to any ethnic restaurant and make this claim if the food isn't the same as your favorite haunt, or that of your moms kitchen.  The fact is, there are many more who liked it than didn't and that should speak for itself.  I would have given 5 stars save for their charging for a small cup of brown rice in lieu of the white rice included in the meal. I will admit however, I've never had brown rice quite that good. Nor have I ever seen or experienced the grain color and texture of this variety. Perhaps its a rare, costly type. I don't know.

Sara, the owner contacted me, advising how the brown rice they use is a particular grain that does cost them a little bit more, accordingly that's why the extra charge.  Kudos to TT for their attention to detail, Yelp, and follow-up!

Kudos again to  TT. You guys cost me a great meal last night.  While you were hosting some kind of benefit for Morocco, your restaurant closed in the process, I sat in your parking lot arguing with my wife over where to go next for dinner. This, after the ticket-takers told us to dish over 100 bucks a piece to attend the event or beat feet. (They did say it in a nice way, so one star)  Agreeing with her on where to eat is a small miracle anymore, so when we decided TT was the place... around noon yesterday....I spent the remainder of the afternoon fantasizing about your green curry.  Very similar to how I fantasize about me and my new secretary one day getting it on in the supply room.   Sadly, I was unable to cough-up the two hundred bucks to check-out the belly dancers and eat whatever that rolled-up stuff was I saw being served.  Anyway, we argued for the next half hour before finally going to Wendy's, where I slurped chili out of a cup while listening to two old hippie bikers argue over which was better....the '67 Panhead or the '67 Shovelhead, whatever the shit they are.   Four stars for getting home in time to watch Teeny Weeny Bikini Patrol in its entirety, so it wasn't all bad.  I'll be back, and when I do, I'm gonna order everything on the menu, putting your chef's ass's into some serious effin overdrive to make-up for last night!  You just wait.

If  perchance you're one of the many Scottsdale residents who believe Malee's is the only place for good Thai, think again. You have another choice, it's Takeda.  Takeda's dishes, the result of generational family recipes prepared by the owner rival anything on Malee's menu and, I don't have to drive half a city away for it.  Last night I tried Uncle Som's something or other. It was splendid. I went with two and a half on the heat scale. I don't recommend this level of spice unless you're a seasoned pepper aficionado, one who routinely eats raw habaneros. My wife typically orders the same dish each visit, the green curry. Spicy and wonderfully delightful. But the coup de gras is their 'forbidden' rice.  We were informed how this rice got it's name from the King of Thailand who apparently forbade anyone to eat it except for him.  What an asshole, right?  Well it's a damned good thing someone smuggled the shit out of Thailand and got it into Scottsdale, where now, I can eat it at will.   Purple in color, short in grain, and when cooked to al-dente perfection, has a unique flavor all unto itself, never having tasted anything like it before.  The best way to describe it is this:  If I was King (Scottsdale), I'd command Ken Singh of Singh Farms to grow this stuff for me, and only me. Nobody would ever get to try it.  Well, maybe my wife if she was nice to me for a change and not alla-time smarting-off.  I'd let Ken Singh keep some for his trouble, but not very much.  And that's it... no-one else. Well, maybe Takeda.  Yeah, probably Takeda, since they already know how to cook it and all.  But that's it. No-one else. The rest of you would be shit out of luck.   Why I'd even post up security guards to make sure the kitchen help doesn't try weaseling off with their pockets loaded.  And all of you?  Forget it. Nobody gets to try my forbidden rice. Nobody. Why, I wouldn't even let you SEE it.  Not without paying a cover charge or something.   But sadly, I'm not the King of Scottsdale.  Shit.  Go to Takeda. Eat the forbidden rice and know, you're eating something that only a few hundred years ago in Thailand would have probably gotten your head chopped-off or something.

I'm not really sure who their demographic is, but I think they've targeted the character's from Nemo and The Little Mermaid.   When you walk in, precariously positioned into forming an aisle, are several fish tanks of small goldfish.  Lots of goldfish. As in thousands of goldfish and nothing else.  No little underwater scuba diver figurine blowing bubbles.  Or rocks to dart in and out of. Or plastic weeds. Just thousands upon thousands of goldfish.   Then there was the hostess...dressed in orange. The walls and ceiling resembling an aquarium. And the lighting, making it seem you were part of the whole goldfish spectacle.  While you're looking around, scouring your memory banks to recall if you've ever seen anything this weird without having first ingested a generous quantity of  LSD, a waiter dressed with orange fish buttons will appear.  He'll suggest ordering their hand-stretched noodles, but don't. Eating these flavorless 'things' will only dredge up bad memories of when you were in college, eating ramen like it was your job. Now you're curious.  This whole thing is too weird..it has to be a setup...a camera crew about to come running out of the kitchen to inform you how you've just been punk'd.  But sadly, there's no producer...or crew.  Just your fish-buttoned waiter, the orange hostess, and your date, who's incessantly jabbering about how cool this place is.  What does she know?  She ordered the rice cakes and green tea.   If you do get suckered into this place by the Chinese guy in the window hand stretching the noodles, you're in for a good sized check and a disappointed palette.  On your way out, stop and check-out the goldfish tank for any tits-up floaters.  The orange hostess will look at you like your crazy. Screw her.  She's the one dressed in orange.

Be honest. How many times a day do you check yourself out in the mirror?  A bunch? I know, me too. Sort of. Well...not really, but I do look for my reflection a lot In all sorts of things.  Like the toaster.  Or my computer screen when it's black, and almost always my car...its windows as I'm getting in, and the rear view while when I'm driving.  Well if you like checking yourself out too, a lot, have I got a hot tip for you! Pita Jungle.  The food here is great.  Let's see, you need to order something...yeah, just get the cilantro-jalapeno hummus for an appy, and the lavosh pizza with chicken as your entree.   There, now that that's out of the way, check out that mirror on the north wall spanning the entire room. Glorious isn't it. And there you are. Is this not the shit???  You, in all your glory, sitting there facing the mirror and talking to your bottle of Coors light as anyone who tries to furtively check-out your backside is busted by your mirror glancing skills.  You'll delight when your order arrives, as you can now watch yourself eat, drink, and steal wayward glances at all the weird people in this place who ARE NOT looking in the mirror at themselves.  I also recommend the Coors light. Not too hoppy or bitter with just the right amount of alcohol. They serve it in a brown bottle with a cute blue label indicating it's cold.  Just precious.

Like you care, but this is where I do my grocery shopping.  But you should care...you know why? Because Safeway, this Safeway in particular, is full of old people. And why is that important? It's not. Except for when there's only you and one of them headed for that open checkout stand.  Never a wait. Not here.

Are you a hiker bored with the same old routine; weekend jaunts up Camelback or Piestewa? Try this on for size, McDowell Mountain. You can access it either from the Windgate or Bell Pass trails, then, once at the pass, it's pretty much vertical. (No formal trail) Not vertical as in ropes, but more like a 75 degree ascent. Completely do-able with sticks, boots and strong legs.  The trek from Gateway Center to Windgate Pass is around four to five miles on a nicely graded path. Once at the pass, you'll need to free-climb the rest of the way. Your reward? A 360 view of the valley, spanning from Mesa all the way to the Bradshaw and Mazatzal mountain ranges. Simply spectacular. I recommend starting pre-dawn, especially with the hot weather approaching.  If you do attempt this hike, wear good boots, long pants, and leather gloves since some of the ascent is on all fours. Also bring a ton of water.  I went through six-sixteen ounce bottles and ran out a couple miles before returning to The Gateway.   Here's another tip. If you're by yourself, wear a bike helmet in case you go down. Also bring a cell phone and an old cd with you in case you fuck-up and break a leg or twist an ankle or something. You can call for help and use the cd to flash signal the air ambulance.  Note: There's no trail to the top of McDowell Mountain from Windgate Pass, but you can follow an old barbed wire fence laying on the ground for a ways, starting just up from the pass. When you're finished with this achievement, head for Temple Bar, just down the street on Thompson Peak & Bell Roads where in a fitting salute the mountain's namesake, General Irvin McDowell, you'll slog down a couple beers and as many shots in his honor.  General Irvin McDowell.  Famed Indian figher, West Point grad, and chronic alcoholic in his later years. Drink one for you and several for him. What the fuck.  No-one in the bar will care, in fact, their level of interest in your accomplishment will likely be measured in micro-give-a-shits.

I love Indian cuisine. So much so, that if I see a sign from the roadway advertising Indian Food, I'll veer across three lanes of traffic, driving as though I'm Vin Diesel's stunt double in those "Fast and Furious" movies, all in an unashamed effort to sample their worldly delights. Well, Tandoori Times is just one of those places.   When I'm in the mood for Indian, I will typically run other drivers off the road, push mothers with strollers out of the way, and knock the legs out from under old folks, on my way to TD. And all for one menu item.  The Bengun Bhartha.  This eggplant dish is so glorious, it's as though it was passed down from the Garden of Eden's secret recipe book, which Eve presumably stole right along with that apple. All the other menu items are good if not great, but as I say, the eggplant is one of those dishes that makes me fantasize about it while I'm eating my wife's homemade cooking.  I hate to admit it, but TD has made me a food philanderer.   As far as service, ambiance, and everything else, who cares.  When you love something as much as I love their eggplant dish, the waiter could have servers Alzheimer's, my table could be in the middle of the parking lot, and that idiotic Indian music could be blaring faux  Barry Manilow. I simply don't care.  Just give me the eggplant, some chai tea, and a guest who hates Indian so I can snag all the leftovers.

My doctor tells me I'm not getting enough fiber in my diet, explaining how fiber is nature's broom. How I should eat more vegetables for a healthier lifestyle.  I say he's full of shit, rationalizing how Coor's light, made of pure Rocky Mountain spring water and a host of other boiled veggies, along with Doritos, also made of veggies,  have made me practically a vegan of sorts.  Ok, so maybe he is right. Maybe I should eat more veggies. But the veggies you get at the grocery store are laden with Agent Orange...a toxic chemical designed to exfoliate rain forests.  Now what?  Singh Farms. A twenty acre organic farm on the corner of Thomas and the 101, where despite its sneaky disguise, is sitting there growing all kinds of healthy stuff guaranteed to sweep your digestive tract faster than a Canadian curling team.  Yes, this place is the bomb. Literally. No more Metamucil, Turbo-lax, or Colon-blo. Ken Singh's veggies will clean you out like a guest contestant on Poker All Stars.  There's one more reason to come visit here. It's a Saturday morning respite from your week's grind, with its long, winding paths and the many shaded table areas to sit and ponder life...as you kill time, hoping the bimbo-du-jour back at your apartment has packed up her stilettos and bounced.

I've never been 'green'.  I never wanted to go 'green'. And here I sit.  Green.  What's next? A pair of Birkenstock's and a lifetime pass to Lillith Fair? I don't rule anything out at this point.  Singh Farms has changed me.   One star for Ken SIngh.... explaining yesterday how my destiny, and probably everyone else's in America eating store-bought veggies will likely involve any number of health maladies from ingesting chemicals.   Four stars for his taking the time to explain organics.  Showing me soil samples, comparing his organic soil with soils lacking the carbon / nitrification process due to the overuse of pesticides.  And one more for the jar of honey i got there. Oh, and a few more stars for watching his turkey's synchronized gobbling... I've never witnessed three tom turkey's gobble on queue at exactly the same moment.  It was mesmerizing.  Go visit Ken. He's the Stephen Hawking of organics, sans the wheelchair,  cancer-kazoo, bad attitude, negative views on life and a creator, and his over-the-top-misogynistic views on women.  Ken is a delight.  His Farm is even more so.  Someday, I expect our kids will be singing about HIM instead of Old McDonald.

Sometimes all the stars in the universe line up in just such a way that you'll find yourself waking up one Saturday morning without a hangover.   Whenever this happens, it's important to get the fuck out of the house before your wife takes advantage of your ability to not fall off a ladder, chop your foot off with the lawn mower, or blind yourself with some household cleaning product.  You need an escape. But not just any escape.   You need to find refuge for a sufficient period of time to make sure she gets the house cleaned and laundry done before your return.  Singh Farms IS that escape.  Start with Ken Singh's juice bar.  For five bucks you can get some kind of organic smoothie that'll supposedly offset a weeks worth of drinking. I had an orange something-or-other with habanero thrown in. Dee-lish.  Next, wander the garden.  It's like something from a Lewis Carroll novel sans the Mad Hatter or Red Queen running around trying to kill you.  Throughout the garden, (really a farm that looks like a magical garden)  there are places to sit and people watch. This is fun. Mainly because most of the mopes who come here on Saturday are all;     "How are we on kale Moondance, we're getting a little low, aren't we?"  Yep, you guessed it.  Gen X hippie fucks from Portland who are now rummaging through the veggie bins like there'll be no sunrise tomorrow. Ignore them. They're a sack of wet butt-holes.  Sit and wait till sometime around eleven am, this is when the weekly celebrity chef begins cooking the lunch menu...typically some fresh picked stuff from the garden he or she turns into a culinary masterpiece. This is all done in an open area outdoors using a clay brick oven and a hot plate.    The house should be cleaned by now and she'll be soon heading off to get her nails done. Time for you to head back home. Only don't go empty handed.  Grab a bunch of leafy shit from the Singh Store, this along with some organic honey and a host of other weird looking veggies, most of which are unrecognizable. When you get home, spread out your bounty on the counter.  This is a huge move.  When she gets home and starts yapping about your magical disappearance this morning, point to the veggies. As if to say;      "Hey...what the fuck??? I went shopping for organic veggies for us. What        do you want from me anyway?"  Also, inform her of how you picked up a bag of compost so she can plant some flowers.  Now go back to the couch for the Kansas State, Baylor game.  Try not to point out how she missed a spot vacuuming.  That'll get you a nice whack on the head with that bag of orange looking stuff you now wish you hadn't bought.

If there was some type of cosmic explosion in outer space, and everything in the universe was suddenly sucked into this gigantic black hole, I seriously doubt the vacuum pressure created by such an event could rival the suck this AJ's produces.  This place sucks so badly, I won't even ride my bike near it for fear I'll get swooshed up inside like I'm in one of those drive-thru bank tubes or something.  All this leads me to believe that the 'cool' people always hanging in front of the store must have the same suck polarity as AJ's, otherwise they'd have been swept away by now.  Food poisoning twice. Once from the salad bar, another from a turkey wrap deli feature.  If there's a God of suck, this is his Heavenly domain.

Totally taking back my prior review, this location finally won me over with their meat department. On most days, you can find a large chafing dish atop the meat counter and in it, small chunks of beef, chicken, sausage, and other meat products, all prepared in various sauces. Here's the best part.  Most customers frequenting this location act like they're too dignified to try the samples so the pan is usually full. Until I get there. The toothpicks provided to sample are about 4 inches long, allowing for a nice mini kabob. I go to work.  The guys behind the counter don't care if you load up, in fact they encourage it, often often complaining about how most of it gets tossed each night. We don't want that, now do we? Do you know how many starving people there are in the world? Throwing food out is a sin. Right?  So I snag about 4-5 kabobs, pick up a craft beer or two to legitimize the visit, and call it good for supper. The Italian sausage in marinara is the best, followed by the glazed beef tips. On Saturday mornings, try the peppered applewood smoked bacon, a strong recommend.  Anyway, If I was homeless, I'd be hanging out in their dumpster.

Walking into Brio is like walking into some kind of palace.  Its highly ornate decor, combined with the well dressed staff make me feel like royalty.  Princely, I order, with a quick hand gesture shooing my waiter when finished. I'm in full character now.  All further communication with my server will be hand gestures, either kissing the fingers on one hand to signal bravo, or the back of my palm in a waving, dismissive manner.  I do neither. Instead, I enter into a vegetative state, still in shock from seeing the shallow little bowl of Pasta E Fagioli they just served up.  Then I taste it.  That's when I wish they would have assigned me a royal taste tester to make certain an unruly chef wasn't trying to poison his magnate.   I get through the soup, but I'm still unable to speak for fear the next thing out of my mouth will be "Off with his head!"  I've learned the hard way it's not pc to invoke the term 'head' when on a date, and in such palatial surroundings.

If your business model relies heavily on newly-minted, post-pubescent teens to sell electronic gadgets to consumers whose lot in life has been made miserable by THEIR OWN newly-minted, post-pubescent teens, something is seriously amiss with your business model.  Hey Best Buy, major news flash.... I don't listen to my wife half the time...do you really think I'm going to listen to some pimply-faced puke telling me why my hard drive crashed? I already know why my hard drive crashed and bad fan motor it was not.   It was someone who walks, talks, and has the same complexion as one of your 'associates', who resides with us and instead of looking for a job, spends his days hooking-up the family computer up with internet STD's he got from porn sites.  I'd rather you go all Costco on me with no-one in the aisles instead of having these dolts, (in large numbers)  lecturing me on how to close all my programs, turning the computer off nightly so the fan doesn't burn out again. Seriously?  When you train these idiots to stay the fuck out of my way upon entering the store, I'll come back. Until then...I'm out.

The idea of Lo-Lo's on a Sunday morning has to rank right up there with Segway, Farmville, and the bumpit.  The line to get in was worse than the Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland on a school holiday.   The hostess was sweet, explaining how the wait could be close to an hour or even longer.  When asked if we could get take-out, her response was the same.   Sadly, i couldn't wait an hour, eventually coming to grips with how my waiting in line with such a bad hangover could morph me into a one-man Donner party.  As the hostess patiently awaited our response, I stared off into space, fantasizing about life in prison, the result of my conviction on some trumped-up cannibalism charges after the manager caught me gnawing-off an elderly woman's kankles.   "Sorry, we'll come back later," I politely responded.   No chicken.  No waffles.  No prison.  Goodbye Lo-Lo, hello DeFalco's.

Been to this place twice, First time was for happy hour. A dozen seats at the bar and only a few tables. Unless you can get there by 4:30 forget it. Second time was for lunch.  Disappointed when the waiter told us they didn't have one of the salads available due to their not having any tenderloin.  Really?? A.J.'s is next door....be resourceful and go buy a freakin tenderloin for God's sake! Nonetheless, the meal was ok, the waiter filled my diet sprite with water, and the bill for 2 lunch salads with tip was 50 bucks. If I'm going to pay this much for two salad, I dont need all the accompanying grief,. Wont repeat.

Service was attentive and friendly. Five stars for smiling, happy-chick waiter. The food however was shit. No wait, let me rephrase that. The food was as if a huge pile 'o shit walked into their kitchen, took a shit on the floor and one of the kitchen staff came hurriedly rushing over, scooped it up and plopped it into five serving dishes, loudly announcing to the servers;            "ORDER-UP, TABLE TWELVE!"  We were table twelve.  Corn and asparagus succotash was dry, with no semblance of anything asparagus, not even the flavor. it was orange. ORANGE for christ's sakes!  The creole soup was as if someone in the same kitchen where shit just took a dump, emptied a can of tomato paste into a bowl, threw in some uncooked okra and for effect, one little tiny bay shrimp. Curious.  A burger ordered medium arrived table side, drier than a nun's hoo-ha.  The house salad dressing so odiferous, it reminded me of my armoire after my dirty boxers have steeped in it for a few days.  And the hummus. Before tasting it, my wife said something cute and upbeat, something like;  "This has mango in it, it should be delicious."  It wasn't. I never tasted mango or any hint of mango. Instead, I felt like Napoleon Dynamite where he tastes onion in the cow's milk. The hummus was overpowered by onion and had a strongly acidic bite.  Completely inedible unless you're a hobo or something.  Basically, that's five for five, making me long for the use of Yelp pentagrams with which to rate this place instead of stars.  Three beers, five appy's, a fruity cocktail of some sort, a friendly server, flat screens mounted so high you'll crane your neck to watch them, and a drunk couple next to us PDA-ing themselves into the record books with the world's longest and sloppiest tongue kiss ever. The couple was pretty entertaining however, as he groped the back-meat sausage-ing out from her way-too-tight sundress. And all this for fifty bucks.   I'm never going back. Not unless I die and come back as shit, in which case, I'll use their kitchen to take a dump.

It's March and in less than sixty days, you'll be headed for the beach.  Uh, one slight problem.   You've been in kind of a funk lately, eating way too many desserts while your only form of exercise has been limited to deciding which pair of sweats to wear any given day.  Well it's time to bust out of that funk and here's how.  Hiking at McDowell Mountain Park, aka; The Gateway.  You want a tight butt? One that'll finally grace a string bikini and not a ruffled onesy?  This is your place. Dust off those jorts and come here to begin your summer shape-up / hiking regimen, choosing from any one of fifteen or so trails ranging from beginner to difficult.  Try this for the next sixty days and watch the magic unfold.   Your legs will soon begin to resemble those of a Swedish weight lifter; you know, the ones with last names with all vowels? You'll get nice and tan too, another bonus. There are other benefits too.  The next time some so-called  'Stanford undergrad' says he's taking pictures of the ceiling features at Axis-Radius, only to discover your up-skirted business is all over the web the next day, those thick legs will come in pretty handy when this time, the only thing his lens is going to capture will be a couple of huge thighs concealing your girly mystery.  You've got this, girl. Hike till you're tighter than a nun's clam at MMP.

I went there thinking / hoping this place had some resemblance of its predecessor; The Fish Market. Boy was I mistaken. First, there was nothing that resembled a typical lunch menu. Everything on the  menu was $$, including the 1/2 sandwich and fries for 9.95, which I'm sorry I ordered. The sandwich was remarkably small, with 1 small piece of lettuce, slice of tomato and what looked liked a small scoop of tuna. The bread looked like it may have been right out of a loaf of Roman Meal bread. The fries seemed like a normal small portion. When served, I recall how astonished I was at how small the entire combination was and how I knew I would be hungry afterward since I don't eat fries, however, the substitutions came at an extra charge. Which meant I just got a tiny half sandwich for 10 bucks or a tiny sandwich with cole slaw for even more $.  This was a lunch experience that made me angry with each passing moment i sat there fuming, primarily due to the lackluster portion, the price, and the mediocre service.  I really dont like to score a place one star, but in this case, if Bluewater has the stones to sell a small, ordinary 1/2 sandwich for 10 bucks, I feel the need to tell anyone interested how this place offers absolutely no value for the $$.  I will never go back to this place. Once bitten, twice shy as the saying goes.

If your ancestry is from one of those weird countries whose name ends in 'IA', like Bulgaria, Algeria, Bosnia, Romania.... You're genetically predisposed to liking cabbage rolls.  I'm not, but I love cabbage rolls just the same. This place is where you go for great cabbage rolls. One usually does me in due to the size, but if you're Bulgarian or something, you'll probably want the entire chaffing dish. (I think those 'IA' people are a fairly large breed)  The sauce, slightly sweet, the meat filling features raisins for added flavor. They're a little pricey, but hey, where are you going to get cabbage rolls?   If you like cabbage, and you're hoping to get even with your satanic co-worker tomorrow with a memorable,  grey-matter destroying case of the farts you got from overdoing it on the cabbage, I can't think of a better recipe.   Don't deny your heritage...you're a fart-factory by nature. Feed the beast, I say.  Come here and be the 'IAN'  you always knew you could.  Note: A side of cole slaw and cleaning up your wife's reuben also helps in this endeavor.

As a young boy, my parents had a rule.  "If you don't like the taste of something, don't say anything while at the table"  Their logic? Simple. It would prejudice my siblings tastes, my parents having a full-blown food revolt on their hands at that point. Pretty smart actually.  So, ever the brainwashed, can't let go of his mommy daddy issues, fucked-up adult I am, I never complain while at the table. But when I get in the car to drive home look out.  And when I get to a laptop look out even more.  Everything here has gone downhill, to hell in a hand-basket as some might say. And guess what? For all my Yelper and friends who don't speak Spanish, La Canasta means basket.  Yesterday it meant waste basket.   Green chile was lumpy, too much thickening agent and the beef wasn't braised tender, little chunks 'o rubber.  And that pot of menudo sitting in the middle of the buffet area? The one without a lid?  One has only to ponder the fate of some flying insect whom upon leaving his nest one fine morning, deep in a depression over spending its life lighting from one pile of dog-shit to the next has decided to end it all by kamakaze'ing his shit-wreaking self into the fucking menudo pot.  You know, the one without the lid?  Not on my short list of Mexican food eateries any longer, this despite my knowing the former owner.

Take the meanest rodeo bull in history, 'Bodacious', carve him up into tiny chunks, and serve him in a green chile burrito and you'll come fairly close to one of La Canasta's delights.  The meat was like a dog's chew toy, save for the chirp when you bite down on it.  They should discount anything containing chunks of beef due to their featuring DIY tenderizing.  They should also have a conspicuous warning sign on the menu reading:                                                 !!   WARNING  !!                       OUR BEEF PRODUCTS REQUIRE CHEWING. LOTS AND LOTS             OF CHEWING. IF YOU POSSESS ALL 32 ADULT TEETH, PLEASE            PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!            IMPROPERLY CHEWED CHUNKS OF OUR BEEF COULD RESULT            IN A HIDEOUS, BYSTANDER REPULSING, DEATH FROM CHOKING            SINCE ITS PRETTY MUCH A LOCK THAT NO-ONE HERE WILL KNOW,            PRETEND TO KNOW, HEARD OF, OR CAN EVEN PRONOUNCE            THE TERM  'HEIMLICH MANEUVER'.             ACCORDINGLY, MANAGEMENT STRONGLY RECOMMENDS A            CHEWING REGIMEN TANTAMOUNT TO A RABID HYENA.            MAULING, FOLLOWED BY GNAWING, AND EVENTUAL MASTICATION            IS ENCOURAGED.                        THANK YOU.  Stopping here was NOT my idea. My spouse, who still lives in the eighties, will do anything to once again sample their green chile of yesteryear. I keep telling her it doesn't exist, but she keeps sending me back every few months, hoping it was 'just a bad batch'.  Tonight's bad batch left her with five chunks of unchewed beef on her plate, followed by a bathroom clearing bout of diarrhea. My bean burrito was pretty tasty, as usual.   Five stars for their bean burritos. I'm deducting four stars for their diarrhea inducing cuisine that cheated me out of my Friday night freak.

It's Friday night and your wife asks what you're doing tomorrow.  Always on your feet, you make up some bullshit about helping out at Habitat for Humanity, spackling drywall or something important like that.   You're really going to the horse track and titty bar with your buds, but no point in starting a fight...she'll appreciate your day's activities when you come home drunk and balls out horny. Good logic, I know.   She then informs YOU of HER plans for the day....shopping, and not for groceries. Shit. Your' day 'o fun plans have just gone up in smoke...you know the ending to this story.  She comes home with a dozen bags from all the big stores, pirouettes around the room holding up each item, announcing, "Guess how much I saved today?" The Visa bill will be here soon enough you're thinking, no point in guessing. What do you do?  Cancel your 'Habitat' plans and offer to take her to the Scottsdale Quarter for a day of chaperoned shopping.  Once there, usher her directly to H & M, find a seat on the bench outside, whip out your Ipad and settle in for an afternoon of Angry Birds. Between the cheap deals, and the long lines to try stuff on, mostly from every middle-aged mom and her teen who feel the need to try everything on, she'll be in there for hours.  Guys, you'll love H & M. I think it stands for Hit and MIss on the fashion side, but who cares, you don't have to wear any of that stuff.  Their prices are so cheap, it's as if cheap walked into the room and gave birth to Cheaper, making certain there'll be plenty of room on the Visa bill for a couple of ATM withdrawals next Saturday when you're at the track and titty bar.  If you do go to H & M, stop and say hi. I'll be the guy sitting on the bench outside pretending to play Angry Birds, giving off a really bad vibe to all the women strolling by as I furtively check out their backsides. Maybe I should have gone to 'Habitat' instead.  Yeah, no, I should have gone to Habitat.

Barro's Pizza and a Sunday afternoon watching football is like mashed potatoes and gravy, they just go together.   If you're like me, Sunday is a day to break from my daily regimen of violating each of the seven deadly sins, but it's hard Ringo, it's real hard.   Sloth, couch. Lust, cheerleaders. Anger, losing team is my team. Greed, medium sized bet hoping to parlay truck payment into house payment. Envy, I wish I was an NFL player. Pride, gloating over win.  And then there's gluttony...  Gluttony happens when I'm out of beer,  need food, and, (refer to sloth) refuse to cook. Tortilla chips and bean dip won't cut it. I need something substantial. Enter Barro's.  Barro's makes a fine pie, both thin and thick crust. They deliver within an hour, and, I don't even have to move from the couch.  Their wings are good too. With a medium pie, dozen wings and tip, I'm all in at 25 bucks.  I love Barro's, even though they are a sinful enabler.

Well now you've gone and done it Mister. It seemed pretty funny at the time, but those brain-disabling farts you cut in the kitchen this morning have now cost you a new Mr. Coffee carafe. You knew she likes to throw things...what were you thinking?  Don't despair. Buzzberry will be there to see you through the day. Stop in for a cup of joe and a blueberry scone, I think they're homemade.  While you're waiting, you can even fantasize about the cute young server who's smiling at you, unlike your wife, whose perma-scowl was the last thing you remember after kissing you with that carafe. Forget it dummy, you're too old and she gets paid to smile.  Maybe that's the answer. Tomorrow, when your wife gets out of bed, greet her with a smile and tell her there's a dirty twenty in it for her if she whips up a pot of joe and some scones.  This instead of faux-farting karaoke to White Stripes, Seven Nation Army.   Chicks don't like that shit for some reason.

An older Italian man who absolutely knows his shit in the kitchen. That's Tony, owner of Amore. And if there's one thing Tony knows, it's how to make Italian sausage and homemade meatballs.  You've got to trust me on this. I was raised by four hairy upper-lipped Italian women whose job it was to make sure I was a better cook than shortstop. I spent weekends, summers, and all idle time in between playing sous chef to my mom and aunts.  This makes me uniquely qualified to know a few things Italian, such as:      *  How Italian women don't believe in feminine hygiene products. (or razors)      *   Sinatra and Dean Martin are really saints, not singers. My mom still makes          a sign of the cross if you mention Sinatra.      *  How hand grinding 120 pounds of pork shoulder every few months making        homemade sausage will most likely account for why your right shoulder now        'goes out', practically on command.  And after making all that sausage (and meatballs) for family events, I know a thing or two about good sausage.   Tony, hands down, makes the best Italian sausage in this city and every restauranteur knows it, having supplied their sausage at one time. Eating it last night brought back a flood of memories. Not good ones either. I don't know what it was with Italian women beating us kids with wooden spoons, but suffice it to say, it fucked me up proper!  Try this.  Call Tony. Tell him you're having a party and you want his meatballs and sausage as appetizers. As for all the other menu items...his sandwiches are better than Subway (next door), his pizza, mediocre. Not the best and certainly not the worst as some reviewers here would have you believe.   Focus on his meatballs and sausage and you won't be sorry. He makes a decent 'gravy' too.

Why is it most women, on Sundays anyway, have this expectation you're going to take them to breakfast as some kind of post-coital reward? First it was snuggling. Then snuggling followed by chit-chatting. Now, they've added one more thing to the list...breakfast.  You need to reverse this trend, and quickly, before she starts demanding you spend the day with her, probably at Costco or Home Depot. Here's my recommendation.  If there's no Waffle House in the vicinity, the next best thing is IHOP, particularly this IHOP. Between the slow service, indifferent servers, botched orders, and flavorless creations, you'll marvel at how IHOP has remained in business for this long.  Here's the best part. The next time she says, "take me to breakfast," merely invoke the term IHOP and you're out of the woods. I can't help you with the snuggling or chit-chatting, unless you're the type of guy who can muster up a brain-damaging fart at will, which should stop her in her tracks.   Now you're really home free.  Literally.

If once a year you decide to take your friends up on their offer to go hiking next weekend, don't. I thought it would be fun.  It wasn't. I was sick at the first signpost -The one in the parking area. It never got any better.   My lungs, inflated for the first time in years with something other than weed and cigar smoke, were seizing up like an old whore.  My legs, so jittery from the experience, caused my car to lunge back and forth on the drive home as my jimmy-leg worked both the gas and brake simultaneously.  And my feet - they hurt so badly, I had to soak them in ice before going out later that night.  I'll be back up there next weekend.

Here's what you'll like. The salsa bar.  It features about a dozen types of salsas, ranging from traditional to the more obscure pecan. The cochinita quesadilla, which really doubles as a Mexican stromboli only deep fried and not baked, is a culinary triumph. And the artwork, all of which macabre -  depicting 'Dio del muerto' scenes -  is erie to say the least, but colorful and provocative.  Here's what you won't like. Your missing car if you don't lock it and set the alarm. The chairs - likely designed by an orthopedic surgeon whose life's mission is to rid the world of scoliosis, one taco aficionado at a time.  In their defense, the chairs look to be some kind of Mexican relic, something they found in an old Mission or something. They're artsy and very heavy carved wood.  One problem. They're so heavy, when you stand up, attempting to furtively sneak to the salsa bar for the fifth time hoping no-one will spot your sloth-ass in the process, they'll give you up in a New York second as they make the most God-awful racket scraping the bare floor.   I don't like it when I'm trying to be sneaky and some inanimate object signals everyone, warning them of my intentions to abscond with the entire salsa bar, greedily hogging it all to myself.

Does this ever happen to you? You're in Vegas, hungover to the point where you secretly wish there was immediate access to a loaded handgun. Then you rationalize. Death won't even cure this hangover, so you go for the next best thing - an eating binge. Yes, only food and aspirins can help you now. But where to go? So many choices in Vegas. Here's what I do. Head to The Quad, wind your way down a seemingly endless maze of hallways, up a couple flights of stairs and voila, Hash House a Go Go.  Ask the server for the most popular menu item. She'll be quick to tell you it's the Sage Fried Chicken; a mountainous glob of mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, and of course, fried chicken - all suffocating under a lava flow of spicy, melted cheese.   Snakelike, I unhinge my lower jaw, loosen my 501's, and begin entertaining curious onlookers with an eating frenzy even Jaws would admire. High fives from the staff as I waddled out - leaving a smoking trail of beer farts - crop dusting my once cheering adorers who are now face deep in their own piles of food.  I went back to the room to chill, thinking; "I really could have used that handgun."

From the first day, I treated her like no other. I lovingly washed her. Wheeled her outside twice a week. And, when she fell, I was quick to pick her up and clean her off. Then some miserable fuckstick of humanity stole her...right out from underneath me.  I called the City of Scottsdale and reported her missing.  They said they would have a new garbage container out to me in two days.  I won't let this one out of my sight.  Not ever again.  Five stars, Scottsdale.

Are you middle aged?  With teenage kids who you're certain are the spawn of Satan himself? Here's some advice.  Torture them with a trip to the MIM. They'll have no appreciation for the place. But that'll soon change when you inform them how learning to play the zither, a forty-plus string instrument resembling a harp will get them that new Camaro for their birthday.  You giggle to yourself, knowing deep down they have about as much chance of playing zither as they do passing calculus, especially after hearing their ear-splitting rendition of 'Stairway to Heaven' on your old six string.  So as you while away the afternoon at the MIM, marveling at what other cultures around the world call music, your two teenage boys are darting from one exhibit hall to the next in search of a zither to see what kind of gauntlet you just threw down.   You've accomplished two things today.  First, in some perverse way, you've taught your kids how capitalism works...hard work and how it pays off. You hope this will help them in some fashion...mainly, in order they pass economics and finally get out of high school...and the house.  Second, in their frantic search for something called a zither, they manage to actually learn something about musical instruments around the world.   Even you learned something today. Something very fundamental about America as you make the metaphorical connection between our having the Auto-tune while other cultures are still playing tree limbs. It's then you realize why we have an atomic bomb and they have spears.

If you're in the hood, drop in for their bean burrito. It's deliciously different.   It looks like a 28-week preemie and weighs in right around the same. I have no frame of reference on the taste however since I don't eat kids.  I may appear mean enough to, but I don't so don't even go there, let's just stick with the burrito, ok?   The beans, silky smooth refried beans.  The tortilla, extra large... grilled until crisp and flaky. (the different part I was speaking of)  And the taste combination? Muy Sabroso!  (damned good)  The seating here is really strange.  Hand carved, high-back wooden chairs so uncomfortable, anyone sporting a bony ass has about 3-5 minutes to eat before finding themselves scooching around like a bored first grader trying to get comfortable.  Forget it. Not possible on these things.   Overall, for a fast place to grab a very large and very tasty burrito, despite having to wolf it like you're in an eating contest...a result of the chair, I highly recommend this place.

The excitement of looking forward to the weekend has now passed, having taken along with it your money, brain cells, and a formerly dent-free ride.  Nothing left to do now but laundry and commiserate about the coming five days at work. Wrong. Just like Sir Edmund Hillary making his final push up Mt. Everest, you dig deep for that one last party push. It's in you, grind it out.  Somewhat subdued from a weekend of shots and the spasmodic activities following those shots, I opt for a mellow night out.  Bar North is the place.  For twenty bucks, you can get a decent bottle of house red and any one of a half dozen appetizer plates. We had the antipasto, followed by a thin crust pizza.  Another twenty bucks got us a second bottle and a small bowl of spaghetti and meatballs. A third bottle would have left its mark the next morning. We called it good for this particular weekend. (Even with the dent).  Bar North on a Sunday night is a good way to forget there's a weeks worth of shit headed your way in less than 12 hours.  Some like to call it work.

Gordas' fish tacos are on par with Wahoos in SoCal and The Hula Grill in Waikiki. If you want to taste one of the best fish tacos in all of Phoenix Metro, pack-up the kids, dog and grandma and head for Gordas.  Gordas delights on so many levels, I have to give it my highest Diego rating in the history of e.v.e.r. They're just that good.  On a personal note, I'd like to encourage anyone reading this to try Gordas at least once. Mainly because I know you'll be hooked on them like I was, increasing the likelihood Gordas will grow and flourish and I get to continue to enjoy the place.  The restaurant business is tough, with it's 95% failure rate. To let a restaurant like Gordas succumb to these sobering stats due to a lack of customers would be an outright travesty. Especially when they're this good. In short, I hope Gordas becomes the Wahoos of Phoenix, they deserve it.  If you want a taco, forget Jack-in-the-box, or any 'mexican' joint claiming a 'berto' in its suffix, there's really only one place to go. Gordas.  PS By the way, your wife can come with you, grandma and the dog too, but only on the condition that she take a big healthy whiff of the fish taco before eating it.  Maybe then she'll finally appreciate what you've gone through all these years.

If you were lucky enough to pick-up a smoking hot babe at the Franciscan Renewal Center (see my review) this is where you want to bring her afterwards..It's right next door.   Only don't let her fill up on the free cinnamon roll appy's. Huge rookie mistake!!!  According to Dr. Oz, ingesting copious amounts of sugar triggers a woman's pleasure center in her brain, making her feel like she just had one of those tantric eight-hour  orgasms Sting is always bragging about.  Yes. The same pleasure center you were hoping to satisfy, only without sugar.    So for starters, wave off the cinnamon rolls and go for the Belvedere Martini, order it dirty.  Order another half dozen or so. Catholic girls need loosening up a bit.   Then skip the meal altogether and head for the nearest Hampton Inn, where tomorrow morning she can have all the sweets she wants from the free breakfast buffet.   It wasn't easy going to church for the first time, but I'll bet you're thinking differently now.

Five stars, however, El Chorro deserves more than just lowly stars.  El Chorro deserves a rating system of a different sort.   El Chorro, for all its perfection, deserves a rating system using little baby unicorns decked-out in jewels and adorned with splendid colorful pageantry.  The unicorns would smell heavenly too; a blend of newborn baby and warmed Ghirardelli chocolate. Under this rating system, I'd give El Chorro the highest rating possible.  From beginning to end, the El Chorro experience was impeccable.  Service, ambiance, food, and drink; all were flawless. I even liked the valet for Christ's sakes.  The duck breast was so delicious, each bite had me wishing ducks had more breasts, like dogs. If they did, I'd devour every last one of them. In fact, the preparation was so perfect with its melt in your mouth texture, I'd have no reservations about eating the bill, feathers, webbed feet, private parts, and quack. I've never sampled duck breast this delicious!  For appetizers, consider the tomato and burrata cheese plate. The cheese is velvety smooth and creamy. The balsamic, thick and sweet, likely from Modena and not Milwaukee. The tomatoes come from their garden; red, ripe and dripping with sweet juicy goodness. In concert, these flavors will excite your taste buds, giving them little tiny taste bud boners.   For dessert, try the strawberry shortcake. The chef prepares a wonderfully delicious shortbread cake, presenting it in a small pond of berry compote.  And in the berry pond, a plethora of fresh berries, feverishly swimming about in an ill-fated attempt to avoid my fork.  This is a dessert to behold and I strongly recommend you consume it at warp speed, this so you can steal shovelfuls from your dining partner's plate when she's not paying attention.  Probably the best reason to visit El Chorro, other than the aforementioned is the stunning view of Camelback mountain at sunset. Truly remarkable. I recommend patio seating for the best view.  The next time I visit, I'm bringing a toaster along so I can electrocute myself after taking my last bite. Mainly because I can't imagine life getting any better than this.

Sleeping arrangements for fifteen consisted of four rooms with two queens in each.  That's room for eight, I know. But we're all dudes in town for the NCAA March Madness Tournament and that means not everyone will be in their room sleeping at the same time.  It works out. It does every year. Except this year.  The little bitch at check-in informed us all they had were single beds and no connecting rooms. She said to guarantee sleeping arrangements, we needed to pay an additional fifteen dollars when booking.  One problem. Hotels.com doesn't have a guarantee feature for fifteen dollars, or any amount for that matter.  Fifteen adult males in four rooms with four beds.  Even if I was gay, it still would have been a problem due to the man stench after day two, a blend of beer farts and that cheap shit perfume strippers wear.  If that wasn't bad enough, Bally's stuck us in rooms atop the Indigo Nightclub where those of us who did try to sleep couldn't, due to the rhythmic thumping from 2am to 8 am. Their after-hours party.  It gets better. Bally's, in their infinite wisdom, knowing fully well Spring Break and March Madness occurred on the same weekend, booked a handicap convention for the same time. The National Ataxia Foundation. Fucking great.  A convention for people who are unable to walk, their only ambulatory device being either a walker or Rascal motorized scooter.  No sleep. Trance, albums #1-7 burned into my brain. Feeling bad about myself from cutting off Rascal drivers whenever the first available elevator opened.  Who needs that shit.  The fifteen of us will take our business anywhere next year but Bally's. Bally's, you suck horse balls.

By far, this is one of the best buffets in the Phoenix Metro area with a fairly extensive selection of food types. No real exotic recipes within the various sections, but the flavors, while pretty basic were well prepared and overall above average. The seafood section was like a vortex for me with its smoked salmon offering.  Remember that scene in "Trading Places" where Santa Claus (Dan Akroyd) stuffed that huge fillet of salmon into his costume? That's how the salmon is presented, and just like Santa, I found myself furtively scouring the room as I contemplated grabbing the entire fillet and making an insane dash for the exit. It was that good! I'll be back.

I rue the day we ever met Wandering Horse. I was once young and beautiful, even handsome by some standards. Not now. Not today.  Today I'm a wretched ogre of a human, a jackal of sorts. One whose eating habits, more traditionally, the 'chewing' of ones food, has now been supplanted by a more efficient process; mastication, and it's all your fault.  It's true.  Thanks to Wandering Horse, I don't simply eat food anymore, I devour it.  Waiting at least five minutes after being seated so as to not appear the grievous sort I've become, this as my salivary glands rev, I pretend to be cool. I'm not.  Five minutes are up. Time to pounce.  Salads, breads or appetizers have no place in my digestive tract. These only create digestive confusion and, slow my consumption of the big ticket items. I lock onto the grilled meat and seafood.  Go time.  Most, if not all of the lobster claws in the shellfish section. Gone. Kobe prime steaks, never tasted a one, but I inhaled six. (They're small, don't judge me). And the cherrystone clams in garlic pesto....what garlic, what pesto? Those rubbery little fucks were little more than a distraction while plotting my next moves.  The dessert station.  The dessert station is located in the center of the buffet, a thirty foot oval where two tiers of tiny little plates abound, and atop them...every imaginable dessert creation.  But I don't fall for the tiny dessert plate trick. They exist for for a reason. Management is smart. They know I can only hold a couple of these plates at best, forcing return trips. Well fuck that. I've got a better plan.  First, I locate one of the largest dinner plates from the entree section I can find. Next, I don't think about whether or not I want to try something. Hell no.  I try one of everything because it just feels right. And besides, I have the right tool for the job with this big plate.  I begin loading my big plate by spilling the contents of the tiny plates onto it.   "Aren't you the least bit embarrassed?" my wife sputters.   Fuck no, I'm not embarrassed. If anyone should be embarrassed, it's Wandering Horse's management for this conniving little curveball...forcing me to make several walk 'o shame trips with a small, hard to handle dessert plate.   I begin racing around the oval station like it's the Indy 500, lapping the slow-moving, indecisive dessert-goers, (my wife included) and in the process, dumping at least one of everything onto the big plate. A move that shockingly, earned me the respect of the staff.  After my first full lap, the staff, stationed inside the dessert oval actually began to assist by following me, relieving me of the tiny dessert plates as quickly as I could spill their contents onto my dessert trough. A big five stars for the dessert staff for keeping up with me on my frenzy.  You guys rock.  Now....if only there were a dark cave where I could slip into... an enclave... a retreat from society where I can savor the spoils of my toils.   PS. All of this, including the ensuing sugar-high from the dessert racetrack for only $26.95.  Every ogre's dream.

I ate so much last night I actually went into cardiac arrest.  Paramedics were summoned. They tried everything including paddles. I was a goner.  Then one of the buffet-goers loudly announced they'd just refilled the lobster and crab station and I sprang back to life, just like Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction.  I'm resting comfortably now.  I found some bits of shell in my cargo shorts this morning. I have no idea what happened after my near death experience but I know it involved copious amounts of shellfish.

If you like shuffleboard, boxing, cornholing, ping pong, parallel bars, shopping for antiques, Hamm's beer, Shlitz, Old Style and Thrifty ice cream, (whew) this is your place.  An old (1928) Phoenix warehouse on the national register of historic places, this venue is uniquely eclectic with all of its weird offerings.  The kitchen, an old Airstream trailer (polished to the nines) plays host to two chefs, both of whom you can spy on as they frantically prepare your meal.  There are bars everywhere including an ice cream bar, and, a converted hay trailer for what purpose I haven't a clue.  Parallel bars, with which you can deduce you have no upper body strength.  Wooden pallets adorned with small herb gardens hanging on the walls.  Lighting consists of inverted peach baskets hanging from the open rafter ceiling.   There's a boxing ring, complete with gloves and I presume a no-fault waiver should you decide to jump in and beat the shit out of someone. There's even a bell to signal your knockout round.   Vintage army fatigues from WW2, (the original cargo shorts) hang from the many clothing racks. Tables are converted warehouse racks.  And did I mention the bleachers overlooking the shuffleboard, ping pong and cornhole games? Well there are.   On the day I visited, there was a running club pounding beers at one of the bars. At the other end of the warehouse, a wedding reception was in progress.  The running club was really a drinking club, outfitted in running gear. They came to get hammered and haplessly jog around the block before returning to slam more brews.  I like the concept.  In short, this has got to be one of the weirdest places in Phoenix, but I like it. It's truly a visual extravaganza.... a feast for the eyes.   Try this.  Grab an Old Style and head for the bleachers where you can sit and cheer-on your favorite shuffleboard team to victory.  Really fucking weird, but totally cool.

Two classic hamburgers, (least expensive on the menu) two milkshakes, and one order of sweet potato fries came to forty-two bucks with tip.  Wife's burger was totally uncooked and raw throughout.  Mine was ok, but the potato chips had the crunch factor of peanut brittle. Some may like that, I don't.  My wife got the shits around midnight.  My shits came slightly sooner than hers...like when I saw the bill was thirty seven bucks.  I felt like Andy Dufresne walking bowlegged after a bout with 'The Girls', as I 'walked' out to the parking lot afterward. No thanks, Lush Burger.

How enchanting. A brown bag of french fries that before I can whisk them off to my table, has already saturated the bag with grease. And a double cheeseburger that after only two bites has fallen apart.  I do like the soda dispenser, very unique, almost futuristic in a sense.  In the end, If I want to spend twenty five bucks for lunch for two of us, I'll go someplace where I'm not ingesting a half bucket of grease in the process.   Note:   Don't go here before going to the movies. Your  body's grease-o-meter will be hitting red line, making you think twice about that bag of buttered popcorn.  Or who knows, maybe you like grease. Not me.

Do you ever feel as though you' ve been red-carded by life itself? Sitting it out on the sidelines in some metaphorical penalty box until the economy recovers? I do.  Wall Street I hate you. You stole my money and investments, leaving me to subsist on sandwiches and cheap Mexican instead of steak and halibut.  But I'm a trooper.  Making the best of a bad sitch.  Adapting. Becoming one with the ninety-nine percenters, after my one percent fall from grace.  Jimmy Johns is a big part of my 'penalty-box' plan until my next ship comes in.  The Italian and the tuna are all I ever order. Both delish. Their bread is thin, without all that crumb....great if you're counting carbs. Unfortunately, that's all I've got left to count these days. Fuck you Wall Street.  Sorry, I didn't mean to curse.  Yeah, no...I did.  Fuck you again Wall Street!!!

In Arizona, if you want a really good steak but don't want to take out a second mortgage to pay for it, I suggest you come here. Cave Creek Smokehouse.  A New York Strip is seventeen dollars and it puts most other places to shame at a full inch and a half thick. Seasoned perfectly, caramelized and cooked to perfection, this was one of the best steaks I've had in a very long while. The sides were good too.   Save room for the strawberry shortcake...it's superb.  After dinner, mosey on over to the pour house. Lots of locals, (mostly transplants) who look like they just stepped out of pages of Bridle and Bit. Some real characters.  The men look tough, but they scare real easy.  Pussies.

Let's say you need a clandestine meeting place. This is it. It's a fairly decent sized saloon tucked away in the corner of a small retail plaza. In short, it's off the beaten path and not easy to find unless you know it's there.  Why is this important? Because when it's time to break anything; from your wedding vows, to fourteen violations of the RICO act, (save for counterfeiting) here's where you want to do it.  The place is busy, full of locals, noisy in some areas, quiet in the back room, and, here's the best part; FBI wire taps are virtually impossible here due to the noise.   Or, let's say you're here on the off-chance to humiliate your concubine with 8 x 11 images  of her doing it with her neighbor kid, again, this is the place.   If you go, try the Sirloin Steak Cobb salad for around twelve bucks. The IPA selection is lame so don't expect a decent beer buzz. In the absence of a nice braciole and a good chianti (and fed's listening devices) Tavern Grille is the next best thing to mama's table.  And when you're done here, if it's not too late you can walk next door to Andreoli's Italian Grocery for a nice cannoli and a Yoo-Hoo.  I can't guarantee there are no bugs in Adreoli's. And no large crowd of people with which to display pictures of your mistress b'jing little what's-his-nuts next door.

As a Phoenix Native, I'm used to all the "Family" owned Mexican food restaurants like Manuels, Macayos, and Garcias to name a few. So its great to see the Vasquez family expand into Scottsdale with their newest Some Burros location.  I doubt  Scottsdale residents know about their original restaurant, Pancho's, ( on South Central in Phoenix) and I doubt this crowd would ever venture down that way...even on a bet.  But good news, you don't have to. Some Burros is not one of those idiotic ____berto's chain restaurants, nor is it a taco bell, baja fresh, or any of the other lame, so-called "Mexican" fast food joints. Some Burros is  a great atmosphere, half the price of Manuels or Macayos, takes 15 -20 minutes tops, and the recipes are off-the-charts good. Their concept and business model is unique from others in the sense that they offer great recipes for half the cost and in a sit down atmosphere.  Scottsdale...take notice and patronize this location to insure they stick around...otherwise we will be doomed to Macayos, Manuels and Arriba once again.

Atkins and South Beach diets say eat more red meat if you want to be thin.  Harvard Medical School says to eat more red meat if you want to be dead.  Implicitly, this means my new weight-loss goal should be somewhere between thin and dead, and since I tend to lean more toward thin, I'm going with dead.   And here's how. Someburros' crudo burrito, sans the tortilla. Order a side of crudo for $3.25, and if Harvard is right, you'll be dead in no time, this despite it's deliciously marinated beef smothered in spicy tomatillo sauce.  Yes, if South Beach and Atkins are good weight loss programs, you'll be in that banana hammock in less than a month, grossing-out all the girls poolside.  Well fuck you Harvard Medical. As if I'm going to listen to anything you say about red meat or any other fucking thing. I'll bet you guys never even looked at my entrance application...did you?  Do you know what a lousy lib arts degree from Phoenix College gets you?  Can you say nada?  Or don't you waste your precious researcher's time studying relationships between rejected Harvard applicants and how fucked their lives eventually become?  Perhaps you should, because if you did, you'd know how my life is a steaming pile of dogshit, and how my eating red meat and dying is the least of my concerns at this point.   Arrghh

No lack of flavors at this restaurant.  The naan was some of the best I've ever had.  Other notables were the Bhindi Masala, Palak Paneer, and Aloo Ghobi. The Tandoori meats were delicious. All items are cooked to your spice level, we chose four and that was plenty.  Halfway through dinner, I shifted into sport-eating mode and got myself one helluva tummy ache on the drive home, it was that good.  I'm paying for it today.  Well, not really.  My wife is.

When guilt meets pleasure, and you find yourself squarely in the intersection of "Time to break-up with this crazy bitch' and "But she really is the best blowjob in 48 contiguous states" , something has got to give.  What do you do? Take her to True Foods, the perfect place for a break-up.  It's ultra-modern decor means your table setting is minimalist, with it's little tiny salt and pepper shakers, and one tiny little flower in a tiny little vase. And, the eating utensils aren't brought out until your lunch arrives. Major bonus.  Why?  Because just after the hostess seats you both, and upon breaking the news you're finished, whatever she decides to pickup off the table to throw at you won't even raise a small welt.   She's sure to storm out after that, making your trip here a double bonus. You've finally gotten rid of this nut job (no pun) and can now afford to eat here more often. Try the Blood Orange refresher, the turkey burger and the kale salad for lunch.  Eat slowly my friend, and savor the flavors.  Of True Foods. Of your newly found freedom. And of that pride of cougars at the next table who are now staring at you, as your one-man pity-party lures them into a web of deceit.  I love True Foods.

It's one of life's axioms. People love cool.  But not everyone can be cool. You know why? Because they can't afford cool. Cool requires money.  Cool is a way of life. An attitude - one synonymous with bank - explaining why most will probably never attain the level of cool needed to:  * Skirt long lines at clubs, festivals, and sporting events.  * Get away with saying stupid shit like " Oh shut-up Jessica, how would YOU know    if Jason's tool was small or not with that whale vagina of yours."  [Jessica; hurt    but giggling]  * Routinely ignore FB friend requests. (because that's what the cool do)   Well if you aspire to this level of cool, there's one sure-fire path to find it - shades.  Yes, with the right pair of shades, you'll rise to an entirely new level of cool, almost bordering on asshole even. In fact, your new level of cool will allow you to routinely fuck-over those superficial friends of yours at will. All this as they secretly wish you dead, but really, they wish they WERE you.  You'll need about a stack and a half for a good pair of lens', such as Chrome Hearts, or, for five or six hundo you can get a good pair of Matsuda's. Both guaranteed to release the kracken-mean-girl-bitch within, allowing you to say and do almost anything you want and get away with it.  Note: This level of cool can be dangerous, especially if you've never experienced it before. For this reason, it's probably best to be selective when choosing whom to fuck-over.  For example; A childhood besty who knows about the time you feverishlydry-humped the entire produce bin of your parent's fridge while pretending they were JT's business, this as Bye Bye Bye bumped loudly in the background, probably shouldn't make your top five list.

Three charming young hostesses whose combined cleavage was tantamount to the nose cone on space shuttle Atlantis, lent to the sneaking suspicion this place was going to be good. It was.   Still reeling from titty overload after being seated, I was unable to process the menu, let alone speak to my date. Whenever this happens, I typically go hard with steak and beer...my primal resort.  Good call.  The steak was a NY strip smothered in a delicate peppercorn au jus gravy. It was twenty nine bucks and worth every cent. I had two IPA's and some frites to round it out.  My date, the person I can't recall being with throughout dinner, had a pasta dinner of some sort...who cares. I have a feeling her experience here was substantially different than mine.  I woke up this morning visualizing the platter of steak and gravy and NOT the titties.  I must be getting old. Between the tits and the steak, I've got seven reasons to go back. Eight, if my wife stays put at home.

The price of gas at this Shell location is on average .25 cents higher than anywhere else in the valley,  .30 cents more than nearby Costco.  I believe there are two reasons behind it, one ostensibly more plausible than the other.  1.) Its proximity to DC Ranch where there are few gas stations and lots of Bentley's, Range Rovers, and Benz's routinely driving past. This caused the owners to take note, hold out their greedy palm and demand Scottsdale's elite  'give back'.  2.) When Googling "Why are gas prices so high?" you're redirected to Wikipedia...to the term Doggie Style where  unfortunately it states 'the origin of the term is unknown'. This is because the people at Wiki don't drive cars that runs on fossil fuel.   If they did, there would be a blurb somewhere in the definition about oil companies, gas stations, and their direct relationship to both the term doggy style and the American public.  I only go here for Hostess Pink Snowballs, since it's the only convenience store in the area.  Nice job Shell for taking advantage in a difficult economy!

I love the IPic concept, but it's not for everyone, and by everyone, I mean me.   Thirty two bucks to see a movie in a theatre with less than optimal sound, small screens, and uncomfortable (general) seating holds very little appeal for me. Not when for less than half the price, you can get much tastier popcorn, experience a vicious sound system, sit in a semi comfortable seat, and, with the popcorn and drink pass, get both for one dollar at a local Harkin's theatre.  On the other hand, If you're looking for a fun date night, I can't not recommend the Tanzy, IPic, Salt, triumvirate.  Mainly because you won't be going there for the food, movie, or high priced drinks. You'll be going there for date night, and by date night, I mean any combination of expensive activities designed to irretrievably guilt your date into surrendering her panties at the end of the evening.  However, when geting laid isn't your big panacea anymore, (like me, mrrrr) these three places mean dick. No, I'll just schlub the night away for pennies at Harkin's and In & Out, since my poonslaying days are now only distant memories.

High praises for the attentive service and friendly staff, but that's about it.  The experience began with cocktails; a fruit martini tasting almost clinical due its unbalanced high vodka, low fruit ratio, and a Manhattan ordered with 'only one or two rocks' served up in a full glass of ice. Two for two thus far.  The lobster salad, (Valentine's Day menu) a mountainous pile of frisee with a few small chunks of lobster buried deep within, made for a nice game of hide and seek as I watched my date feverishly pick through the lettuce in search of what little lobster was embedded within.  The cedar planked salmon entree was another huge disappointment.  A good cedar planked salmon should have the aroma, smoke coloring and caramelization of, well, cedar planked salmon.  This was anything but.  This salmon, while cooked properly, was tasteless, other than its normal salmon flavor. Now, plop it onto a flat, (non-fluffy pile) wet, soggy serving of cous cous and you've really got a plateful of disappointment.  We also ordered the duck, which was delivered roasted and rare.  So rare, it was like cutting raw chicken due to it being so flubbery. But again, as I mentioned, the staff was extremely helpful in bringing out a new plate of duck, this instead of the kitchen simply heating up the unwanted serving.  After this level of disappointment, desserts were out of the question, but interestingly enough, our server never even offered us to see a dessert menu.  How weird is that? It was like he had ESP.  Throughout dinner, a woman, (we surmised a floor manager) paced the dining area as if overseeing the staff. Too bad she didn't stop by to inquire how our meal was or if everything was alright. Another disappointment.  Ironically, if you read other Yelp reviews of Tanzy, nearly all of them feature a management response, either praising Yelpers for their high marks, or, apologizing for their less than stellar experience.  Tanzy, please, there's no need to respond.  I don't want an apology, or some lame reason why things weren't the way they should've been. I'm afraid that would be much too little, too late. The time for that was while we were still captive within your domain.  What you should do instead is: Gordon Ramsey your Executive Chef. Make the mixologist sample his / her creations until they bleed vodka out of their eyes. And finally, have the person frantically pacing the aisles put a smile on her face and actually interface with the patrons, asking about their experience... seemingly pretending to give a poo.

The Scottsdale Quarter. This is where you sit it out while your wife is across the street, shopping at H & M.  You never know how long a woman is going to be in a shop, but if it's a Saturday, it's a safe bet she'll be in there a while. Thus, my election to use the time wisely, visiting TK's Urban Tavern.   Four stars for my attentive server who was quick to notice I was chugging beers like this was a high-school kegger, minimizing any 'down' drinking-time between servings.  Her swift and attentive service allowed me to enjoy an afternoon of shopping I normally wouldn't have otherwise. The chipotle shrimp appy was pretty tasty too. I only wish there were more stores in the area where my wife likes to shop so I could for once enjoy an entire game and catch a decent buzz.  Until that happens, I'll simply compliment her el-cheapo H & M tops and encourage her to go back for more while I do the same.  Beers aren't cheap, but it's either this or sitting on the bench in front of H & M with a bunch of old dudes in pressed shorts covering their navals, black socks with flops, and baggy Hawaiian shirts talking about how nice it is here and how shitty cold it is in Minnesota. Like I give a frog's fat ass. Mrrrrr.

Probably the best reason I could ever give you to not give up on your vegan friends is the fact that nearly every vegan I've ever known has fallen, and you absolutely want to be there when it happens.   Yes, eventually, these altruistic assholes all fall from grace at some point and when they do, they typically fall hard. This is where your role as an enabler comes in handy!  You're a carnivore by nature.  Things like carcinogen warnings from smoke, or a bowel-obstructed ending don't scare you in the least. You've made it your life's business to know the best places to eat tasty animals of every species. And this is why you'll bring your newly converted friend here, to the Hog Trough.   The Hog Trough serves up some of the finest smoked meats in the region, rivaling any Texas or Kansas City BBQ joints I've been to. Their sauce needs work, but if you're a purist like me, an antithetical vegan by nature, you're going to want to get this place on your 'last supper' bucket list.   The service here is slow, but then this is Mayberry so get used to it.  Get used to how the locals come in just to talk to the staff, as the staff conveniently forgets they're employed, and, happen to be on the clock.  Forget how the food is served up on paper plates, with plastic utensils, styrofoam cups, and the cheapest napkins known to mankind. Forget all that.  Simply revel in the moment, taking it all in.   You're in one of the finest carnivore establishments this side of Phoenix, dining with a friend whom for years has admonished your eating habits.  Well eat and enjoy, marveling at the notion that with any karmic justice, your friend will make up for lost time and red-meat his ass into an untimely ending....the victim of his own prophetic words;  "cancerous, bowel-obstructing, red meats aren't good for you Diego, you really should try the vegan lifestyle."  I tried going vegan once, but found I couldn't live off of cold pizza, stripper glitter, and beer for more than a week.

If Jesus makes a second coming, I'd recommend two things.  First, he get a good law firm...preferably Jewish, specializing in personal injury.  Second, he drop all that fish and bread nonsense when it comes time for supper and head for the Hog Trough with me.  Jesus would be all;   "Behold, my son, thine pork doth fall off its bone.  And thoust brisket is moist and juicy, unlike my blessed mother Mary's whom, being Jewish should have known how to cook a brisket but apparently never learned to do so because she was busy cheating on my dad with God.  Now eat my son."  Also, if he does come back, I hope he brings a bankroll with him.  I could just see him trying to stick me with the bill, claiming his robe doesn't have any pockets and all. But I won't have it.  Shit, he's Jesus.  If anything, he oughta pull a miracle out of his non-pocketed robe and stop time while we dash for my ride and bounce the hell outa there.   Anyway, that's if Jesus were to come back. I think he's smarter than coming back to this world's mess, no matter how good Hog Trough and Goldberg and Osborne may be.

No stars for the air conditioning in 32 Shea. I was sweating like the day I got married throughout my visit. The beer selection is limited, but if you like a good pilsner, they serve Grand Canyon which is a fairly decent brew. I paired it with the bruschetta.   Upon entering, you'll marvel at their ingenuity....getting fifteen or so tables to fit in a space smaller than a Catholic confessional. Kudos to you guys. I felt like we were all part of a human sweat-lodge experiment.  My server was friendly, and patronizing. I like that.  "You're cute" will get you a nice tip. I'm not cute and I know it. So did everyone else at our little table when eyebrows raised, signaling she's out of her fucking mind.   If you don't mind being pressed nuts to butts with strangers, I strongly recommend this place if for no other reason than to try their bruschetta combo plate. It's divine.  Four solid stars for someone telling me I'm cute.  If she only knew, I'm shallow too.

Being one of the only Italian-Americans on the planet who believes pizza and lap dances are the biggest waste of money, sadly, I continue to take pleasure in both.   You know those three wise monkeys....see, hear, and speak no evil?  Well, I'm the fourth. Taste no evil. I hate bad pizza.  Which is why I go here. I'm never disappointed.   The other reason I go here is because of Patsy Grimaldi himself, (God rest his soul) We Italians do that.  We always feel the need to invoke 'God rest his soul' when speaking of the dead, despite it being highly inappropriate.   Anyway, Patsy's story is an interesting one, and one you can only find on their menu, which is another good reason to go here.  And here's one more, in case you're not sold on the place yet.  It's in the Scottsdale Quarter, where there are plenty of girls, many of whom look like aspiring young strippers. You'll have to use your imagination. On the girls, certainly not the pizza.

For my money, which today happens to be on par with winter temperatures north of the Arctic Circle, this is the place you want to get stewed before a movie. Salt is inside the IPIc complex, making it  super easy to get bozo'd before your showing. Two hours of drinking, followed by two hours of movie while wolfing sliders...pretty damned cool in my book.   Let's say your college football bets didn't pan out quite like you planned. This is when I  typically say fuck-it-all and head straight for the movies. Movies, particularly bad ones offer perspective on just how good I have it since I'm not being chased around a vacation rental by some psychopath with a meat cleaver. All I did was lose this months house payment on today's Alabama game. No biggie.   The bartenders at Salt are friendly and attentive. They're also pretty proud of their skills, boasting how as a professional mixologist, there's no drink they're unfamiliar with. Yeah? Any drink?  When my bartender couldn't make my wife's whatever the fuck, or even knew the ingredients, she tried to walk him through it. When it finally arrived, it was as if some kind of barnyard animal peed into a cocktail shaker. It was that bad.  Feeling bad, (presumably ashamed of himself)  drinks were on the house. Go figure.  I lose big, drink for free, and fall asleep in some bullshit chick movie.  All in all, not a bad day, unless you factor my completely fucking up today's point spreads.  Anyways, I'm coming back to Salt, even if I have to pay next time.  They make their women servers dress like there's a Girls Gone WIld film crew in the house. Not a bad thing.

I'm not sure what the 'V' stands for, but I think it means Eddie V's off course, a little more often than not. At least that's sums up all my experiences.  I've been here three times, hoping at least one them would have supported what my fellow D.C. Ranchers are always spouting-off about this place.  I've concluded that perhaps in their drug-addled youth, they got a hold of some bad LSD, predisposing them to the belief that if something costs an assload, it must be good.  A ridiculously small lunch portion of halibut forced a visit to the nearby candy store,'Sugar', where I loaded up on my childhood faves, got a sugar rush that made my heart palpitate, and got into a fight with my wife for not sharing my Charleston Chew with her.  I was hungry.  And Eddie V's made me hungry. But he won't do it again. Because I know something he doesn't. Thrice bitten, followed by a sugaring of near fatal proportions, four times shy,

I ate here today, overwhelmed by the experience - it was just that good. Service, food quality, atmosphere, presentation, all wonderful.  After being seated, the waiter brought a gratis shot of porto and a small appetizer; melon wrapped in a porto-infused prosciutto. It was a triumph!  My baguette was amazing as was my wife's crepe, and our dessert, the creme brulee,was off the chart. This was one of those meals that lingers in both your mouth and your brain long after dining.  My wife and I still discuss this little dining gem, likening it to a blockbuster movie that's so well made, you just can't stop talking about it.   I told the server when we left; "We didn't have food anywhere in France."  If you're in a mood for French, it doesn't get any better for your money.

As a general rule, most people are drawn to things they can't or shouldn't have. And with good reason.  Once you cross the line, partaking in life's ill-gotten fruits, you wish you hadn't. This is where life whips out its great equalizer...the sudden realization that you've just fucked-up....getting involved with something never meant to be.   I'm talking about Coal Burger. The many times we sat on the patio at Stingray Sushi, looking longingly across the way at Coal Burger. Its packed house.  The people waiting for tables. The wafting aroma of flame broiled beef.  It was too much. We were sucked in like a Vietnamese basket-whore, (so i hear) despite neither of us liking ground beef all that much.  Missing lunch, we came here for an early dinner...like way early...like 4:30 early. There was us and one other party in the entire place.  This is where CB defied all logical thinking patterns.  Service was poor, and the burger even worse. We were informed when ordering how all burgers were cooked medium unless specified differently. Fine. I ordered extremely well, asking the meat be caramelized. My wife, medium.  My wife's burger was rare, as in seared outside, tartare inside. Mine wasn't caramelized, unless black is the new caramel.  How does this happen when there are only five (5) guests in the entire restaurant? There was a replacement burger and plenty of apologies, but that's not what I'm looking for when I spend twenty five bucks on two burgers and beers.   CB...if your main product is burgers, and your default cooking method is medium, you might want to weigh the idea of having a timer somewhere in the kitchen...like next to the grill.  What a waste.

In the film world, there's the "chick-flick." In the lunch world, there's Arcadia Farms. This place is the ultimate chick hangout, both young and old alike, offering great service, food, and ambiance, even valet parking.  One small problem.  If you're maie, and your testosterone level is fairly moderate, prepare to get sucked into a lunch vortex that could last for up to two hours.  Not because of the service. The service is fast and very pleasant. It's because when women get in this place, they don't want to leave.   In my many experiences here, my wife has routinely drawn out what should be a 45 minute lunch into a seemingly endless afternoon of iced-tea refills and multiple trips to the mens room.  This is when my testosterone kicks in, finding myself with the unpleasant task of sacking-up, demanding she not sample one more dessert, waving off the server and her next round of iced teas, and declaring it's time to go.   Don't get me wrong. I love good food in a charming atmosphere, but at some point, I feel like the Mad Hatter, Alice and the Red Queen are about to come bursting out of one of the rooms, validating my suspicions that Arcadia Farms is really one big tea party for chicks. I will gladly return to this place, but only if I have an appointment scheduled for that afternoon which allows me to conveniently point at my watch while simultaneously raising one eyebrow, signaling its time to go.  This may work better than the 'sacking-up" scenario.

Sweet Jesus there are a lot of women here. Why is it you only find out about these places AFTER you're married? Sorry, I digress.  Anyway, I was at Arcadia Farms for lunch today and my God was it ever heavenly. I had a glass of wine; something I never drink, and the baked goat cheese appy; something I never eat. I don't know what came over me. I must have been overwhelmed by all the eau de chick wafting through the air.    I don't know what happens whenever I visit here but clearly, my nuts retreat like an Italian army commander each time, finding myself lost in an asexual drift for the hour or so I'm here.  The baby coconut cake is so moist, it reminded me of tres leche cake with whipped cream-coconut frosting.   It's been almost sixteen hours. Still waiting for my nuts to drop. Men...you've been warned.

I'll give you several good reasons to eat here, particularly men.  First, it's in the new Scottsdale Quarter, which if you haven't been to yet is worth the trip.  Lots of upper end shops that attract lots of highbrow folks, but my main reason for going to Stingray...to people watch.  On a typical weekend night, the place is littered with orange tanned women, botched plastic surgeries, cougars of every persuasion, and women of a certain age who simply can't let go of their youth, evidenced by their twenty something fashion and styling.  The food? I'm not a Sushi aficionado, so I can't distinguish good yellowtail from whale blubber. Its all rubbery and flavorless to me. But thank God for pickled ginger, wasabi, soy sauce and beer. I can make a meal out those four things alone as I so often do. But the real reason to eat here is to impress your woman, or any neighboring table of single women should you be dining out with the guys.  I've long held that eating sushi, more particularly sashimi, is an erotic metaphor of sorts. The connotation being that if you eat something really flubbery and disgusting, and, with the faint bouquet of fish, your date, or that gaggle of neighboring cougar divorcees will reason how it shouldn't be a problem for you to munch whatever flubbery mess they're bagging down south.  You don't even need to like sushi, and it just bought you game! A huge win-win in my book.  So being in a place where the women are mostly Scottsdale forty or fifty something divorcees sporting orange accented cleavage and skinny jeans, and, where the food serves as an erotic bellwether, signaling your prowess at eating anything even remotely disgusting, you should consider this place one of Scottsdale's finest!

You know how most chicks love Michael's? Think of this place as the Michael's for dudes.  Aisle after aisle of craft beers.  Handles of everything including Jager. And when they say Total Wine, they're not kidding. I saw wines from practically every country in the world except maybe Somalia or those really sandy, oily countries.   They even have a tasting room, which you'll want to get the schedule app'd into your Iphone like right now.   If there was ever a Mecca for the budding alcoholic, this place is it.  Well maybe not exactly Mecca, since you'll likely be facing south after coming here.

When I die, I'm pretty sure I won't be going to heaven, which is why I come here, for their warm butter cake.  I don't have drinks. Or appetizers. And I don't eat one of their signature cuts of beef.  Only the warm butter cake.  This cake is served on an oval platter. And on this platter is a six-inch long, two-inch thick, oval shaped butter cake cooked to golden browned perfection.  Also on the platter is a small lake of warmed caramel sauce, a generous dollop of freshly whipped cream, and a scoop of softened, french vanilla ice cream.  In concert with all its accoutrements, each mouthful of this buttery delight will have you looking forward to the next with so much enthusiasm, you'll find yourself shiftily speeding your shoveling gait so as to out-consume your date by at least a five spoonful margin.  I say forget all those other useless calories from drinks and entrees and shoot your entire calorie wad on a dessert so sumptious, it's likely the nearest thing to heaven you'll ever experience.

The beverage menu read; 'Cheap Cans $2.00'.   Cheap cans, as I incorrectly surmised was not an older woman named Waynette, whose once youthful 34D's had now fallen victim to gravity. Well, gravity and her recently deceased husband, Sid, overly-motorboating them throughout the years.  Lucinda, with no place to call home save for a stolen shopping cart, is waved in from the alley by your server to flash her 42 longs at you. And for all of two bucks! Boy, was I ever wrong.  Actually, Cheap Cans, as the server informed, is whatever they feel like serving on any given day. Some days Red Stripe tall-boys, others, PBR. Last night it was tall boys.  Someone in our party ordered appys, but I have no idea what it was called. I was too busy ruminating on the whole cheap cans thing. It was ten bucks and it had olives, cheese, pickled peppers, salami, hot salami, crusty bread and hot peanuts.  Two tall boys in, I dispensed with any graciousness and just started grabbing at anything i could get my hands on before the others beat me to it.   I suppose this is one reviewer's way of saying it was damned tasty stuff, whatever it was.

Peruvians claim the 'Pisco Sour' as their national beverage and if you've never had one, you might want to sample one of these bad boys. After all, why not? You'll drink just about anything someone shoves under your nose.  Jager. Everclear. You even did keg stands once on a barrel of Tecate, quite possibly the worst beer on the face of the earth.   Well it's high time for a change.   Come here and order the ceviche, a pisco sour, and about four more pisco sours to wash everything down properly. The ceviche is incomparable...it's simply that good.  The piscos? Your new favorite drink. You'll be buzzing like a high-voltage power line when you're ready to leave, signaling how you're not ready to leave.  Order a couple more and take up semi permanent residence at the bar.  Enjoy the soccer (football) games.  Oops. A couple hours just flew by.  Now you're a gibbering mess, best suited for crawling into a corner, balling up into a fetal position and rocking back and forth, chanting lyrics from a profoundly stupid Prince song.   Alright Mr. 1999, let's go. it's time to have the bartender call a cab.

I brought the fam in today, chilling on the pisco's this time. No need getting trounced in front of the wife and kids.  Ceviche, steak and chicken dishes were fabulous and complimented the Modelo Dark, Inca colas and two lonely piscos. Or maybe it's the other way around, maybe the drinks complimented...oh whatever. And I can't forget the canchas. Peruvian corn nut like snacks, less crunchy and with a whole lot more flavor. Great with pre-dinner drinks.  Three flat screens hanging in the bar, all tuned to some kind of Peruvian TV were also very entertaining. Nothing like watching kickboxing during dinner, a loop of Machu Picchu on state run tv, and a latin soap opera.   Also, once more I got to practice my Spanish on the highly attentive and very friendly server, who was extremely patient with my Spanish tongue.  Dinner for six was $120 before tip.  The piscos are 12 bucks each, but you'll only need one for a great buzz.  Two will have the family screaming "LOOOOOK  OUT"  as you almost hit not one but two moving cars before winding your way through the parking lot and on out to Frank Lloyd Wright.   Driving is such a fucking buzzkill.

The Little Woody is a fun place with its high energy crowd. Small and always happening on weekends, this isn't the place to be if you suffer from claustrophobia because it's jam-packed nuts to butts in here. So here's what you do.  Make up some stupendous bullshit about how you scheduled your bunion surgery for Friday afternoon and need to take off work after lunch...then head to the Little Woody for pre-game. Hang here till the place starts to fill, then bounce around six.  There's a bar across the street on the second floor, I can't remember it's name. They serve giant hamburgers. I know this because some middle-aged guy trying to scam on a girl half his age ordered one and had it split. She didn't eat it because she was all, "What'd you order that for...I don't eat red meat."   Of course she doesn't. But I do. So I winked at the guy and he slid her plate my way.  It was a good half burger. When I was numb, I went downstairs to La Fontanella to eat a bunch of Italian food.   Anyways, oh yeah, The Little Woody is fun when you can have it all to yourself. Otherwise, get ready to do battle with the chick next to you, hoping to get the bartender's attention. Good luck. As if he's going to notice you when her thong is hiked up to her ear lobes and she's wearing a low cut top.  Don't forget to limp into work Monday and remember, you've got ten toes. The bunion thing should get you well into the winter months before having to come up with a new Friday afternoon affliction.

In the grand cosmic narrative that is this life, I have to wonder why dogs got eight tits on average while humans only got two. It seems like we got shortchanged in this deal.    Now I'm not suggesting humans should have gotten eight boobs, not at all. Eight just seems a tad too many, but at least four would have been nice. Stay with me, my logic on this one is sound.  Let start with the first two.  These could be the working titties, the ones reserved for breast feeding and such. While the other two would be there purely for enjoyment. They'd be classed in the non working body parts group, kind of like a spleen or toenails or something.  That way, whenever a baby comes on the scene, there's no more argument over whose tits belong to whom. (A medium point sharpie could help eliminate any confusion)  Anyway, I don't know how I got off on the four-tit rant. Oh yeah, Twin Peaks.  I got a little drunk in here yesterday at their 2-7 happy hour.  The beers were cheap and the Daisy Duke costumes, even cheaper, with all that cleavage dangling about. Well after about three hours, I began seeing double, and that's when I took this whole existential pose on how humans may have gotten fucked in the grand scheme of things. At least as it relates to the tit department.   Come to Twin Peaks, get rip-roaring drunk and you'll probably reach the same conclusion I did. The chili con queso is delightful too.   Disclaimer: This only works if you have a propensity to see double when drunk.

Whenever the need arises to wash my vehicle....  And, I'm in the mood for delicious slow roasted brisket, ribs, or pulled pork...  And, I need to pick through the convenience store-like grocery case for some Nestle's Strawberry milk...  And, I want to watch international soccer games in the car wash waiting area after the pulled pork....with a flavorful Starbuck's-like coffee creation from the coffee bar, while my vehicle...remember my vehicle...the one that needed cleaning...is getting cleaned, I come here.  Tom's Thumb Fresh Market.  Where I can satiate all my worldly needs in one fell swoop...save for getting laid. But I'm guessing if one got really creative, he/she could throw-down somewhere on this huge property.  If you are going to have a go at it, I wouldn't use the men's room though. It smells kind-of weird....could sour the mood.   From this reviewer's perspective, the only thing missing is a place to take a nap after getting laid. A short nap after a furious jaunt is always refreshing and I think the proprietors could have thought through this a little more carefully when building their business plan, because had they done so, this place would be perfect in my book.   A place to get my truck washed, eat barbecue, drink a beer, watch soccer, drink latte's, along with a fuck and a short nap, followed by the attendant tossing me my keys. Now that's the shit.  I'd like to summarize by suggesting how this place may very well be a mere fuck and a short nap away from heaven.

If you live in the vicinity of DC Ranch, then you know there's no such thing as a convenience store anywhere in the area.  Tom's Thumb is that convenience store, only it's much, much more.   Its a car wash, convenience store featuring gourmet (A.J;s type) food and liquor products, and, it's a restaurant  featuring bbq and smoked meats. It's also a coffee cafe and mini bakery.  As a businessman, I've always subscribed to the concept that a business should do one thing and do it very well. That it should have a singularly myopic focus and knows who and what it is.  I'm reconsidering my pose on this.   Taking into account  how some of the most popular tv sitcoms feature a large cast, using the logic that  the public will identify with at least one of the characters, so too goes the Tom's Thumb analogy.  There's something here for everyone.   Last night I was finally able to drag, (kicking and screaming) my more than reluctant wife here for dinner. Call her crazy, but she's been adamantly opposed to dining in a car wash / gas station facility, despite my touting their flavorful bbq entrees.  Our server was young, enthusiastic and very friendly. The food, even better. And,  it got a big thumbs up from my wife. No small thing.  I hope Tom's Thumb is wildly successful, as I like the idea of having a place that sells Longboard and Lagunitas IPA's for 8.99 a six-pack right in my backyard.  Also, as kind of a retro thing, the guys who wash the cars are all outfitted in white coveralls. Very sanitary looking and reminiscent of something out of the '50's. Pretty cool.   Try this place, you'll like the feel of it.

I'm a big believer in delineating between life's wants and needs.  And that's why I regularly visit the Thumb. SImply put, it has all my needs. For example:  I don't want gas for my truck, I need gas for my truck.   Eating bbq doesn't qualify as a want, but it is a need.  My truck runs just as efficiently dirty as it does clean.  But I did hit a bird and squashed a couple of rabbits last month, so a wash and detail is kind of a need at the moment.  A savage blowjob is also a need, I think. Or maybe it's a want, who knows.  I'm not sure.  Anyway, they don't feature blowjobs here, least-ways, I'm pretty certain of it.  Ok, fine.  Maybe The Thumb doesn't have ALL my needs, but it does have most stuff and, at fair prices.  I recommend the brisket. Also, the full-service wash. Enjoy the patio seating for lunch, especially this time of year so you can lust after all the cool RV's next door at the storage facility. I'd like to steal a real nice one. Maybe go running around Scottsdale showing off in my new ride with some hot little knob-gobbler who also needs to eat bbq.

On DC Ranch's Market Street, located in the same building where San Felipe used to reside, sits a new Italian restaurant...Mia Francesca. Only Mia Francesca isn't a new entity. It's been around for a good long while in Chicago with twenty locations. In other words, they're a solid act. Finally. After all of its predecessors who've come and gone on Market Street, it would appear this place might have some staying power. I can only hope.  The service was all of five stars...friendly, enthusiastic, informative and fast. The fast piece of it was surprising given every table was filled both inside and out. The food, even better with two nice surprises.  The rigatoni bolognese had a couple large chunks of braised beef, this in addition to the ground beef typically found in a traditional bolognese sauce. As I said, a nice surprise. The other was the veal medallions. I was shocked upon their delivery. Described on the menu as simply medallions in a light cream sauce atop roasted veggies and mashed potatoes, these were no ordinary medallions. A medallion in most restaurants is a small, silver dollar sized slice of meat approximately half-inch thick...if you're lucky.  These 'medallions' were mini filet mignons...three of them, cooked to perfection.  Seared and caramelized outside, medium rare inside. The roasted veggies looked like shitake mushrooms but they could have been another variety, not sure. The light cream sauce was truly that...very light cream with more of an au jus texture. So flavorful, it made me eat the mashed potatoes. And I don't eat mashed potatoes. Ever.  The pre meal bread was roasted and served warm. Crusty shell and moist crumb.  The house salad is large enough to spilt and I highly recommend the light balsamic dressing, slightly tangy but pairs beautifully with chianti or sangiovese.  Meal with tip was ninety dollars with plenty of leftovers for todays lunch. Truly a pleasant dining experience.   Nice job on getting the 'bugs' worked out so quickly on your new AZ venture MF. Keep it up and I can see where it won't be long before you have twenty locations in Phoenix, just like Chicago!

Have you ever gone out with someone, whom on the first date you thought they were the shit, but by the second date, you found yourself texting everyone afterward, telling what an asshole he or she was? Well Mia Francesca IS that second date.  My first experience (review) here was a phenom. Splendid in every sense of the word. My second 'date' was if Dr. Hyde himself had risen from the fictitious dead to run the show.  Ever the student of applied 'what the fuck went wrong' philosophy, I deduced the following:  If you're only mildly hungry, asking they split a meal, salad and glass of wine, there's sure to be someone in the kitchen reading your order who's probably jeering your presence, going; "Great. Two cheap assholes in C3 just ordered, two bowls, two glasses, two small servings of bolognese sauce, and all on one order....how'd we get so lucky!"  The rigatoni bolognese order, split, came in four separate bowls. Two with some dry as hell pasta, accompanied by two small bowls of bolognese sauce, not enough to mildy amuse the pasta. The sauce was horrible. In fact, it was the antithesis of all that's holy in Italy. Someone had ruined it by adding way too much salt. So much, I'm pretty sure I'd bloat and retain water for the remainder of my natural life had I eaten a full serving.   The house salad incorporated a balsamic that was much too tart, making me pucker like a criminal whose probationary sentence included going down on Joan Rivers. Anyway, it was bitter, tasting somewhere between bile and gall.  I'm not sure.   And the eleven dollar glass of house chianti was barely drinkable. The result of my asking the server to pick something good. My bad.   I would have, should have complained but the thought of getting a free dessert wasn't going to fix my swelling-up, resembling the Dora the Explorer balloon in the Macy's parade.   I'm going to chill on this place until the winter visitors return to roost. Since most are from Chicago, where Mia originates.  I'm sure THEY won't have a problem taking the manager aside and throttling him after tasting the Phoenix version of Mia.

Plenty of tv's blaring pre-season football and a craft beer selection that'll remind you of aisle 12 at Total WIne. (my happy place) Servers were all friendly and attentive.   Their pizza is guaranteed to fill you like a blue tick with its thick crust and generous toppings. Two slices and I was bloating like a Macy's Thanksgiving Parade balloon.   Ambiance is fun.  Lots of musical instruments hanging from the walls. A cathartic little journey for any failed  teenage garage band.  No waiting.  Walked in at seven on a Saturday night and although the place looked full, they feature both an inside bar and and outside bar.  We chose the outside bar since it was me and my Italian buddy who's unable to speak without using lewd hand gestures.  Overall, MM is a pretty decent place.

We left town unexpectedly for three weeks and upon returning home, not only was our pool green, there were dead animals floating on the surface.   This isn't an unusual event living in the North Scottsdale desert, what was unusual however was the the carnage - a half eaten rabbit floating next to a dead coyote.  I'm thinking the coyote chased the little fucker into the pool, started gnawing on him and finally took the deep six.   Our family was so disgusted we didn't know who to turn to, that is until a friend suggested we call Pathfinder Pools.  A guy named Greg came out and within hours not only were the dead varmints gone, the pool was starting to clear up. Since that horrible event, we've had many other things wander into the pool, mostly snakes and lizards.  One call to Pathfinder and problem solved. Within hours your pool will be clean and ready for your wife's pasty-white guests from Minnesota.  Another time a large snake went for a swim in the pool. Had it been up to me, I'd have left the snake for the party we were having later that day, but my wife saw it and immediately called Pathfinder. I was hoping they'd be like other pool services and not show up, but within a couple hours, the owner came over and fished a six foot rattler out of our pool. He even helped me skin it and cut off its tail and rattles. I now have a cool headband on my cowboy hat and a rattle I use to scare people whenever we go camping.  Thanks Pathfinder (Roger & Greg) for always being so prompt, even if it does mean I have to deal with my wife's amazingly stupid (and pasty white) friends from Minnesota. Their prices are amazing too.

This hotel is delightful.  Clean rooms, fast friendly service, and a nice pool.  Less than two miles away is the Windmill Winery, a bridal venue.  Two miles in the opposite direction is the Arizona State Prison complex.  And less than a mile away is the Old Pueblo restaurant where you'll find some of the best handmade flour tortillas anywhere, including Carolina's in Phoenix.  Unless you're going to a wedding, visiting a societal ass-wart (family member) in prison, or are sick of Carolina's, there's no reason to come to Florence.  But if you do, this is the place to stay. Mainly, because there is no other place to stay.  HIE has a complimentary breakfast that will satisfy the budding diabetic with its cinnamon rolls, pancakes and muffins. The eggs are in the shape of a taco and are presented in a rack, standing upright. Really weird, that was a new one. Also featured yogurt, fresh fruit, and all types of beverages.   All in all, this is a pretty nice place.  The bed was harder than a honeymoon schlong.

Hip and fashionable, Searsucker was a delight. The music sounded like one of my playlists, making it even more delightful. The food, fairly eclectic.  Searsucker's menu definitely marches to the beat of a different drummer with it's crab mac 'n cheese, lobster dumplings, and shrimp in bacon grits.  Other notables were the cauliflower in creme fraiche, and the short rib entree.  On the cocktail side, the Honeybadger brought a tear to my eye. The same drink concoction my late mother used to give us kids when we were sick....bourbon, honey and fresh squeezed lemonade, this drink was not only delicious, but brought back a flood of precious mom memories.  Searsucker isn't for the vanilla lover, it's geared more toward the peanut brittle, fudge chocolate cherry lime ice-cream lover.

Renovated and transformed into a restaurant on par with many fine Manhattan eateries, this second oldest house in Scottsdale joins the ranks of CIBO and Arcadia Farm with its warm, inviting ambiance. You're simply taken-in by its intimate decor.  The staff was cheerful, friendly and highly attentive. The food, superb.  Mashed potatoes so silky smooth, you'll wonder how this is even possible as you make the quick comparison to the slop you eat each year at your Aunt Mary's Thanksgiving Dinner table.  Popcorn Grits.  This side will make you lose interest in your entree as you feverishly scour the table for a large serving spoon rivaling the size of your mouth fully outstretched. I ate this dish so quickly, it was like David Copperfield was in the house!  Imported from a mill in Tennessee, the grits are reduced into a risotto-like texture along with kernel corn, crushed popcorn, and a cheese you'll probably never find on the grocer's shelf. These grits are so wonderfully delicious, after the first bite you won't care what's on the dessert menu as you fill up on this heavenly creation.  Between the mashed potatoes and the grits, I'd eaten more carbs in one sitting than I do in a month.  The ribeye is served with marrow butter atop its caramelized, dark brown goodness. Both the flavor and the smell will captivate you as you're quickly reminded why it is you're so fond of a good steak. SImply delightful. The House knows its beef.  Visiting The House was a treat I won't soon forget, but sadly, and I think I'm right on this one, the next time I attempt to dine here, they'll have a wait list as long as those fine Manhattan eateries you can never get into.  PS: The large pine tree in the rear yard was actually the family's Christmas tree circa 1943. I looked for carvings, but was informed the family consisted of four daughters so it's highly unlikely any of them had ever received an 'Old Timer' pocket knife from dad on their birthday or Christmas.

Teeming masses of hungry foodies have overrun Chelsea's original location, making the parking situation difficult but not impossible...you'll need to be somewhat creative. The problem, as I like to define it is this: The lure of a fine meal, fast service and reasonable prices simply won't dispel the shame associated with blowing a valet.   Hello Chelsea's Airport. A mere five miles from the original located in Terminal 4, this location is never crowded and, if you're in a hurry, they offer a Chelsea's Express window adjacent to the entrance.  On my most recent visit, the rotisserie prime rib was in order. Fortunately, they had an end cut available, making the experience even more enjoyable. The sides were equally delicious. Blanched, cold green beans in a light lemon vinaigrette along with a DD-cup of garlic mashed potatoes. Nom. Nom. Nom.   Oh, and the parking is ample, Sky Harbor Terminal 4 charging only four dollars per hour. Four bucks! That's it.  A lot less messy too.   Any bets on how long it takes for YelpHQ to remove this one? I've never made their ROTD award, but I do routinely win their other ROTD award. "Removal of the Day."

At last, a wood-fired pizza that makes sense of all things nonsensical.  Its crust, thinner than Kate Moss when she was in her heroin chic phase. Its toppings, imported from Parma and all places Italy. And the sauce, sneakily unobtrusive, not attracting attention to itself which is more than I can say for the typical Scottsdale posers who light here.  Throw in a hug and a kiss from a 1500 degree wood-fired oven and you've got a pizza fit for, well, me.  The servers are friendly and attentive. Their prices are fair, considering the location and quality of the food.  One drawback, the parking. There are less than a dozen parking spots outside the restaurant, which means you'll likely have to park across the street in The Village's parking lot. No biggie. There's no traffic to speak of so crossing the street means dick when that old soccer limp flares up.  If you're going to plan a visit, wait until fall when all the snowbirds flock to town. I rather enjoy having Grazie all to myself this time of year. If you do visit in summer, leave your little brats at home. I can get enough of that shit at Grimaldi's where all the DC Ranch shitheels parade their a-hole kids around like its a kiddie pageant.

A fairly eclectic menu featuring items such as pork liver, braised pork shank, and pork belly, Pig and Pickle is a porcine charm.  If you like whiskey, Pig features a selection of over fifty (rough guess) types of spirits including unique ryes that'll produce a Manhattan cocktail reminiscent of a Wall Street watering hole.   The patio is noisy due to its open access to Thomas Road. On this night, everyone seated on the patio nearly jumped out of their chairs at the sound of skidding tires thinking an accident was in progress.  Shortly after, a loud boom from across the street, likely a car backfire, but nerve shattering nonetheless. Throughout dinner, the evening was littered with annoying roadway distractions, not fun.  My advice? Don't opt for the patio no matter how loud the climate inside.   Service was stellar, with the waiter offering helpful tips, advice on how things are prepared and how many servings to expect from various appys. Prompt, courteous, and seemingly well trained.   I had a pork shank accompanied by yams. The yams were a bit spicy but not too, just enough to add a spectacular flavor and wake up your taste buds. Unexpected and flavorful surprise for the non-yam enthusiast.   Pig and Pickle has done a good job with everything we experienced save for some type of barrier between the patio and the roadway to help with noise abatement.

Proof is a great place to see and be seen if you're in the pretty people club. I'm not.  So chances are, if someone's looking at me, it's because I remind them of a family member who spent time in the joint, or, they're in the early stages of cancer and their life's priorities are so fucked-up and they'd bargain with God to trade my looks for their cancer.  If I'M STARING at the pretty people, I try to be furtive, but almost always get caught since they're pretty and used to being gawked at...their homely-radar typically set to high alert.  So I visit Proof and order the Coor's Banquet, eat their beer-battered onion rings, and a chocolate sundae. I had a burger too and in the end, spent a half week's pay in the process. Then I ordered up a few more beers and spent my Saturday wondering how I got hit by the ugly train as a kid while these folks were molded right out  of the pages of Vogue or Esquire. Sucks. I found solace with the goofy looking  Bell Captain who looked like a French policeman with his little gendarme hat.   The surroundings are beautiful from the patio, the people are fashionistas, and the ambiance in the bar is superb. The servers are so polite, they made me uncomfortable...like they were up to something sneaky. No-one is that polite. Ever.  When you've had enough misery from staring at the women patrons whom you know you simply repulse, you'll go across the street to Greasewood where you'll fit in with folks of your own ilk.  I fit in at Proof like O.J.'s glove.

What a breath of fresh air Blue 32. The food is superb. The staff, well trained and friendly and, there are about thirty screens featuring every type of sporting event known to man, except for curling or water polo.  Try this. Order a kobe beef hot dog and a small cup of chili on the side, it makes for one damned fine chili dog.  Now a beer. And some sweet potato fries. And the black and blue cole slaw. Another beer. Then three more.  Now flirt with the waitress because she was so interested in the movie you just went to see at the nearby Harkins theatre, forgetting your wife is seated across from you. Another beer.  Now a cab, since your wife took the car keys AND the car. In my defense, the waitress was totally hot and my balls still tend to function at Homeland Security's level Orange after five twenty ounce drafts.   We may not be going back for a while, but that doesn't mean you can't. Try to get seated in a station where the server isn't so damned hot and friendly.  Took one star off for the cab ride home and the silent treatment for two days, while my balls were safely returning to Defense Level Blue.

I once worked on a cattle ranch in Central Arizona. What a god-awful job. If you're not getting kicked by calves in the branding chute, or rammed by an angry mother cow, you're working sunup to sundown with no relief. That is until supper time.   Our cook, while rudimentary compared to professional chefs, knew how to cook every type of desert dweller the hands shot daily, but mostly quail and beef.  Well not since my starry-eyed youth have I tasted a filet sandwich like the one served up at Cowboy Ciao.  The sandwich will arrive open-faced with a ramequin of brown gravy, a knoll of thin, juicy fries, (more like pomme frites), and a side of slaw. All delectable.   The filet transcends any level of tender I'm used to, since my version of tender resides squarely between London broil, and skirt steaks.  No gnawing (or gumming) your food here. No siree.  If you have the time between flights, settle in for a few, have the steak, and imagine what it'd be like to eat beef every day and night for three months. You'd get so stopped up, you'd probably shit in yer saddle...on roundup...in full view of the senior hand who like to beat you up on Friday nights at the Punkin Center Saloon.  I wish someone would invent a time machine.  I'd go back and fuck him up. BADLY.

I'm going to give this review another try. My first review of Portillo's got removed by Yelp HQ...something I said about their Italian sausage resembling a d^#k they didn't care for, I guess.  Phallic shaped foods in my book are simply the best. They're fun to eat. They're also fun to dangle, pretend suck, angrily bite, and wave around when no-one is looking except your wife.   Their Italian sausage sandwich is delicious with its hint of fennel and anise flavoring, a must in any good Italian sausage.  Their all beef hot dog is good too. Nice and flimsy, and long too, good for waving around, signaling your naughty intentions for later.   The fries, onion rings and shakes are all pretty decent.  The bill was twenty bucks and I didn't get laid afterward.  She might want to apply for a job at Yelp HQ.

It's midday in Las Vegas where hoards of fast-moving passersby armed with colored bonglike glassware roam the streets. It's like a sci-fy movie set in the future. On the corner in front of Bally's are impersonators...Zach Galfanikis holding a baby, Gene Simmons in his Kiss getup, and a life-sized Hello Kitty. I want to punch them all. All hope is gone.  I need an 18 year old, some vicodin, and respite from this madness. Eighteen year-old Scotch, that is.   I wander over to Caeser's sports book to kill time before the Preakness, but the glassware people are everywhere. I duck into the nearest restaurant hoping to find solace from these curious assholes. And there it was. A sanctuary in the midst of it all...Nobu's at Ceaser's.  The server was a nice young man who resembled that creepy shit from American Pie...the one desperate to abduct Tara Reid's panties on prom night.  That's all I kept thinking about throughout lunch.  My prom.  Well, that and Becky Deluca's sudden onset of virtue, not Tara's panties.  Five Asahi drafts and one ceviche later, I was prepared to face the madness once again. The bill was close to a Franklin, but I wasn't bothered. The ceviche was a visual extravaganza, its flavor and texture even better. The draft Asahi was nothing short of nectar, a gift from the barley gods. And the server? While creeping me out, he was more attentive than a black man at a Klan rally.  Becky must be in her mid forties by now. Probably wearing those giant, white cotton panties and mom jeans. I bet she and her husband sport colored glassware when they hit the mean streets of Vegas.  Nobu's Ceaser helped me find center when I needed it most. Mylute paid $5.20 to show. I had $200 across the board on him. Be wary of the bong people when in Vegas. Fuck you Becky.

Thirty two bucks for two fish tacos, two iced-teas and an order of fish and chips. I'm opening with this in order to partially explain the low star count.  My spouse enjoyed the fish tacos, which did live up to all the hype. Sadly, I had a basket of fish and chips and it did not. Of the three pieces of fish, the first piece sampled was foul, reeking of spoiled fish and tasting like jack mackerel, one of the fishiest flavors in all seven seas.  The second piece was delightful compared to the first, while the third had me on the edge of my seat wondering whether it was spoiled or flavorful?  I took a small bite to test the water. It was neither, somewhere in the middle with its fishy odor and complete lack of flavor.   I should have sent it back but didn't, since I'd just gotten into an argument with my spouse over what to order and needed to prove she didn't out-order me. So I ate this stinky load o' bait by coating it with ketchup, holding my nose and swallowing it whole, like I was a fucking sea lion or something. Fast forward four hours.  I'm sitting here with a bad case of heartburn, a sick stomach, a wallet that's thirty two dollars lighter, and a spouse who "can't wait to go back." Well she can go back and eat the whole damned place out of fish tacos for all I care, but I'm never going back. Fuck that. I have principles and one of them is this:  If I'm going to eat out, it should never be a mystery. At the very least, I have certain expectations and albeit low, they're expectations just the same. One such is to NOT get blindsided by knowingly munching on anything stinkier than all fuck.

While stealing coworker's leftovers from the company fridge and not getting caught might be an art form, it's not without its risks. Stuffing a large styrofoam container into the trash can is way too noisy and, it's easy to spot. This is why I choose  grabbagreen.  Their leftover containers are the same containers used to serve their delicious menu items...a small, unobtrusive cardboard box. Easy to boost from the fridge, stuff into the trash without making any noise, and usually just enough food to get me to the afternoon break.  One small drawback.  Grabbagreen only sells healthy stuff, like quinoa and kale and such. They're big on smoothies too, although I've never sampled one yet since they don't tend to make it to the fridge. I thought about trying Ramona's the other day when she went to the bathroom, but she's been pretty sick lately and I didn't want whatever it is she has.   Anyway, I had some quinoa mixed with chicken, kalmata olives, red onions and red roasted peppers. Not exactly what I would've ordered but I'm not complaining. Miranda's leftovers, (name on box) were far less appealing. Way too green, looked like snot with all that avocado. Not sure what it was.  So I'm giving Miranda, whoever the fuck Miranda is, no stars for her obvious lack of menu prowess. Ramona also gets 0 stars. Mainly for hacking up shit all day and not covering her mouth. I'll be lucky if I don't get some kind of communicable disease. Jesus H.   Grabbagreen on the other hand gets five stars, but I'm only going off the quinoa chicken thingy I stole from 'Katy'. What little she managed to leave behind was damned tasty, but then she thought so too apparently. What a hog.  I always hear the girls talk about how expensive grabbagreen is, but I don't happen to share their opinion. I think its extremely reasonable. For now, I'll have to be content with them only going on payday. I hope Ramona gets better soon. I really wanna try one of those smoothies.  This place is yummo.

Oh wow, now I remember. This is the place I went after getting thrown out of the Little Woody (across the street), only it went by another name at that time.   I had several craft brews, got a spectacular view of Camelback Mountain at sunset, and got to eat someone's leftover half-burger.  No I'm not homeless. What the fuck?  It's just that this old dude ordered a burger split. When it arrived, the chick he was scamming on was all...      "Who's that for? I don't eat read meat! Do I look like I eat red meat?"  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sit down and shut the fuck up I'm thinking to myself as this haughty little ingenue delivered a scene reminiscent of Scarlet 'fucking' O'hara in Gone With The WInd, her every word punctuated and overacted.  After her performance, she hastily stormed out. That's when I nudged the guy and asked if he was gonna eat that.  Anyways, I got a great craft buzz, ate a good half burger, and made it down the staircase without getting all knotted-up.   All things considered, this was a five star in my book.

A Manhattan cocktail typically has three ingredients. Virtu's has about thirty.  The list of ingredients read like a mystery novel, where the next ingredient was even more curious than the previous. I tried one out of pure, morbid curiosity. I was richly rewarded for the decision. There were so many flavors in this cocktail, my taste buds practically overdosed.  Virtu also features Menabrea beer, or more specifically, Menabrea Amber. If you've never had one, I strongly recommend it. This hard to find Italian IPA will pair beautifully with any meal, as if it was a fine wine. It's that good.  From the appetizers to desert, Virtu was delightful. The service, even better, making this restaurant every bit of five stars.  Grilled octopus, Branzino, and a custard-like desert were chart toppers.   I read some reviewers complain about the wine list being too abbreviated, the prices too high, and the meal selections limited. These are people who should not be Yelping since they're all very clearly full 'o shit.  Virtu is one of the few restaurants where the price is truly on par with the food. The service, adorns the food and drink experience like an expensive fashion accessory. And the ambiance whisks you away to Tuscany for the ninety minutes you're there.  I wasn't going to do this, write a review this favorable for fear I'll never get a seat again, but that would be wrong. Virtu deserves every accolade it gets. They've earned it.   At least me and the James Beard nomination committee think so anyway.

I've been visiting AZ pain for a number of years with the results always the same; minutes after a procedure, (epidural), I feel human again - pain-free and ready to resume a normal, and very active lifestyle.  Doctors (most are anesthesiologists in past lives) if you get to know them will astound you with their pain-free technique. I highly recommend Dr Graham and Dr. Canaven, both in my opinion, consummate professionals.  As it relates to the staff, they've been nothing short of awesome - Venus, Dawn, Richard, Maryann - all some of the most warm and caring people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting.  I'm writing this for two reasons; First, I had a procedure done this morning and feel healthy enough to dance a cumbia, drink way too much, and get into a fist fight afterwards.  Second, I wanted to discredit the one-star rant by the woman who's not even qualified to 'write' rambling mistruths. (I need a pain shot in my head just for reading those painful run-on sentences).  I recently had the pleasure of an off-chance meeting with six-time Olympic gold medalist, Amy Van Dyken. We spoke briefly about our common champion and hero: Dr. Cecil Graham, whose phenomenal skills have improved both our quality of living. It was so completely inspiring to hear her speak - how he's helped her - all the while comparing her comments with how Dr Graham has helped me.  So, thank you AZ Pain Centers.  Without you guys, day-to-day living isn't such an hour-by-hour challenge anymore.  Like one of my co-workers put it;  "You're walking half-mast again, time to get in to see Dr. Graham."  To Ms. Van Dyken - Thanks for your inspirational attitude. Whether you know it or not, you were truly inspiring.  And to the imbecile who wrote such a slanderous Yelp review - enjoy living with your RA. You probably don't deserve to be seen by such awesome doctors and staff. Your loss.  PS.  I was once told how AZ Pain was one of the original pain clinics - their proprietary formula one of the first 'cocktails' available in the Phoenix Metro area to pain sufferers such as myself.  Small wonder they elected to not share it with an idiot, whom, in all her precipitous haste, felt qualified to discern the difference between the formula's ingredients had the staff chosen to share it with her.  Shhh - don't tell anyone but you know what's in the secret formula?  A whole lot of feelgood, that's what.

There's no conceivable reason this place should still be in business from my perspective. When a person walks into this nearly empty 'House' at noon on a Saturday and is told; "You can sit at any table that doesn't have a reserved sign." and they all have reserved signs, what do you do? I attempted to sit at the bar. There were no stools.  I tried pulling a couple stools from an empty 'reserved' table. The bartender told me to put them back.   I then found a table in the corner with no reserved sign and promptly staked my claim. Within seconds, a server came rushing over to tell us someone had only moments before, called in to 'buy' the table, telling us they planned on a packed house in a couple of hours and they really weren't able to serve us. Can you fucking believe that? I still can't.  I can't recall anytime in recent years where a business, any business, has made me feel so unwelcome as did Derby Public House.  I will come back someday. But it'll be to point and laugh as creditors respossess your bar furnishings, you gigantic sack of assholes.

Sometimes as a parent, you need to punish your child - a labor of love us parents need to bestow occasionally upon our kids.  And its at times such as these when tossing them from a speeding vehicle or 'accidentally' shoving them off a cliff into the waiting abyss that is the Grand Canyon just won't do.  This is why I suggest the Phoenix Herpetological Society. WIth over 1,400 egg-born, scaly, venomous creatures onsite, you're sure to have luck with some type of  'accident'. I'm certain of it. Just kidding, stick to the speeding car thingy.   But seriously, let's say you're a notorious drug dealer, one of such vicious disposition that you harbor some of the world's rarest and deadliest snakes.  Then you get busted by the DEA. What do you do? Well you're going to prison you worthless piece of shit, count on it. But your 'pets'? What becomes of them?   You guessed it, the DEA sees to it they'll get a good home unlike you,  sending them to the Phoenix Herpetological Society.  Or, let's say you live in the Sonoran Desert, waking up one fine spring day to greet a four-foot rattler on the rear patio. What do you do?  Run and get your scatter gun or square point shovel? Not so fast Wild Bill.   Call the folks at Phoenix Herp and they'll have someone there within the hour to rescue it from the otherwise loving end of your shovel or buckshot party.   Did you know Phoenix Herp also has the only croc in existence with a prosthetic limb?  It's true. Scientists at some major University developed a fake leg for one of the crocs. (This might be the challenge for your kid....to see if he can outrun him)  Call to make arrangements for a family or event tour.  It's two hours of pure fun and with any luck, a warning bite for your nine year-old from a non venomous creature.  As I said, a labor of love.

This is an audio visual extravaganza, one that will wow your senses. Over a gozillion flat-screens complimented by their piece de resistance; a fifty-foot* flat-screen at the head of the bar.  The other thing I quickly noticed is how bright the lighting is, making a good pair of beer goggles nearly impossible to obtain.   The wings are, well, wings.  What separates BWW from other wing joints is their many sauce features. My personal favorite is the mango habanero. It's spicy alright, but the flavor.  The flavor is if Venus herself wandered into a chile patch, gobbled down several scotch bonnets, then nursed you with her chile-infused milk. Holy shit are these things good. Hot, but good.  Another little feature is their blazing wing challenge. This is where some guy comes out of the back dressed as famous oil well extinguisher 'Boots' Hansen, and just after serving your wings, sets off a major explosion in your mouth hoping to 'cap-off' your fire. They do give you a t-shirt for your trouble (and tears) so it's all good.  Be forewarned! The next day is a motherfucker if you do take the challenge. I got pretty sick, but in fairness to BWW, I was never really sure if it was the blazing challenge, or, the fact that I spent the night passed-out in the Walmart parking lot huffing generator fumes from the Insane Clown Posse's tour bus.  I never liked those guys. Did they ever have a hit single? And why on earth do they have a cool tour bus?  *not really fifty, but it's major big

Why is it only cows get two stomachs - what was god thinking?  I could have used another one last night after taking down those first two chicken tacos, but being the conservative diner I am, I stopped at five so my fellow diners wouldn't think I'm a hog. I'm glad I did too.  A fine selection of Mexican beer and a pretty waitress managed to do their handiwork after the dozen or so pints just sort of snuck-up on me. That's when I started ordering tacos like judgment day was fast approaching. It was about this time I started thinking how handy it'd be to have two stomachs; the first to process the beer and the other for tacos n' shit. Jesus, I would have cleaned 'm out of tacos last night.  The chicken is charred black and tastier than all hell. The corn tortillas were above average with a slight sweetness. The salsa was weird, but fuck it, the tacos were tasty enough on their own.  Anyhow, fuel eating doesn't play here. It's either sport or feelings, pick one. I did both but I'm paying for it today, farting all nine musical octives.  If my sphincter was a bit tighter, I could probably hit high C.

My first-time here today and far from the last. Attentive server, superb food, and dog-friendly patio just put BB on my rotation.   Also, kudos to the manager for responding to so many Yelp reviewers.  It frustrates me how Yelpers, particularly those bent on defaming with their doleful attitude and writer's prowess of an eight-year-old, give a restaurant one chance to make good or else look out - the wrath of Khan is upon the eatery.  I'm not sure I could hold back my responses to some of these idiots the way the manager has so artfully done.  In and of itself, this speaks volumes about B & B. You've got my vote.

Upon entering, you're immediately besieged with the heavenly aroma of fresh fish, reminiscent of a fine bayside restaurant. This, as your attention is drawn to the long glass showcase of fresh seafood.  The restaurant is another story. I won't go into too much detail but will say it needs some work.   The owners, whom I understand have never been in the restaurant business would do well to hire a strong executive chef - someone who knows how risotto should be creamy and fluffy, not dry and heaped into a lump. Or how the temperature of the fish should at the very least be lukewarm. Some of the other issues can be found in the other low star count reviews.  They're not that far off the mark, but I suspect if they don't get some of these issues fixed before the tourist season ends, they could become another statistic by late summer. I'd hate to see this since they do have an above average seafood market selection.  Step up your game guys and you'll have a year-round customer for life.

It would appear Sam Fox finally has something to worry about.  The Oslo group, owners of this delightful restaurant, has hit the mark with Kale & Clover. Kale shows a lot of promise if the goal is to dethrone Fox as king of eclectic valley eateries.  The menu, an abbreviated selection of many favorites found at True Foods and Chelsea's will delight. The juice selection is equally on point, with its many antioxidant offerings sure to give your circulatory system a cell orgasm.  The concept, similar to Pei Wei, is to order at the counter, take a number and await delivery as you sip wine or other healthy beverage from plastic stemware - sans the stem.  Grabba Green, (a non-Fox entity) came close to Kale, but stopped far short with its high prices, lack of seating, and repulsive cardboard box serving containers.  If you're an on-the-go person looking for a healthy eating experience at reasonable prices, look no further. The same holds true for the octogenarian, whom, in only a few short steps from the handicapped parking to the counter, find a quick, healthy meal in a very casual atmosphere.  The ambiance is superb with its open-air entrance - no doors or windows to contend with and plenty of informal seating - both indoors and out. The food, at least what we sampled, was well above par. The staff - well, they need some work, but overall, very pleasant despite their spacing my wife's order.   It's hard not to believe we won't see other Kale's sprouting up throughout the valley, this as Fox and Chipotle go scrambling back to their war rooms in a feverish attempt to figure out just what the fuck happened.  In the world of healthy eateries, Oslo appears to have struck gold with Kale. Round two - Oslo, and not by decision, but rather a stunning TKO.
