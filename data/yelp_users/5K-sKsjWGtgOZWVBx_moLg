Dr. Steven Nelson never had much time when my wife and I met with him. He was my wife's doctor for our first pregnancy and we had lots of questions. Appointments lasted 3-7 minutes. At one, I brought a notebook with several questions written out. As I went through the questions, Dr. Nelson gave answers such as, "Google that ... doesn't matter... Google that ... Don't worry about it... Google that one... etc." He had no interest in giving us information.  We had a difficult labor/birthing process. My wife's water broke before any pre-labor or contractions or anything. We were already 6 days late, and figured the baby was on the way, so we went to the hospital. The hospital gave us a 24-hour deadline to deliver the baby because of risk of infection. So we went through different stages of induction, and none of them worked, and Dr. Nelson was not present for anything. He spoke to my wife once on the phone to scold her for not being induced days earlier, which was something he had mentioned as an option. He said on the phone she would probably have to have a C-section because she didn't listen to him. This was very frustrating because we actually did want to listen to him and get advice from him, but he never gave us any instructions, and when we were at the hospital he wasn't there, so we went along with the recommendations of the nurses. I feel his attitude toward my laboring wife was completely inappropriate.  36 hours after the water breaking, Dr. Nelson said he would come in during his lunch in a couple hours to do a C-section. We asked if he could come in sooner. Since the C-section seemed inevitable, we just wanted to get it over with. Was he upset that we wanted him to come before his lunch?  During labor, my wife's epidural did not work; she still felt the pain of contractions. This was concerning as she was about to have major abdominal surgery, so we expressed concerns. The staff assured us she would be numb before surgery. The anesthesiologist gave my wife a "spinal" since the epidural wasn't working. Unfortunately, this only worked halfway. They did this test where they poked the location of the incision with a needle to see if my wife was numb. She was not numb on her left side. They asked, "Are you sure you feel sharp pain, and not just pressure." "Yes, I feel the sharp pain." Their solution to my wife's numbness was to use local anesthetic, which numbed only the surface of my wife's skin, and Dr. Nelson did the incision. As the other parts of the surgery progressed, my wife was pleading with the staff to stop because she could feel the pain of the surgery. I don't know why Dr. Nelson did surgery on my wife when she wasn't numb. I've heard from a couple other doctors that they would never perform surgery on a patient who wasn't numb. They said to me, "I don't know what he was thinking." He continued with the surgery while my wife pleaded and cried, and once he got my daughter out, he gave some signal to the anesthesiologist who pumped her with something to knock her out. On top of all of this, my daughter almost died. I doubt this was Dr. Nelson's fault, but her first "breath" resulted in her completely blocking her airway with mucus or something. Staff had to work on her for a while before she was breathing on her own. It was traumatic. After surgery, my wife had a horrible recovery. She could hardly move or walk for a couple of days without a lot of pain, and she experienced moderate pain and difficulty for weeks. My wife's second delivery also resulted in a C-section, but the recovery was way faster and better. Every decision Dr. Nelson made resulted in more pain for my wife. The way he handled her organs and uterus; the way he performed surgery on my wife who wasn't numb, and the way he had a student or intern stitch her up all caused my wife a lot more pain compared to the second time with a much better doctor, Doctor Grayson Guzman. It was as if Dr. Nelson was taking out his anger on my wife. I suspect Dr. Nelson resented my wife and shared frustrations with his colleague, Dr. Erin O'Sullivan, since she also scolded my wife. At 4 or 5 am on the first night of our stay at the hospital, there was this knock on the door, and Dr. O'Sullivan came in and turned on the lights. We were both in a daze and had no idea who this woman was, but she introduced herself and proceeded to tell us off. "Hi. I'm Dr. O'Sullivan and I work with Dr. Nelson, and just can't believe that you wouldn't take Dr. Nelson's advice. He has a great C-section rate, and you're ruining it because you wouldn't listen to his instructions. It's your fault you had a C-section and I don't think it's right that it's going to reflect badly on him. " She said something along those lines and left. Her only intention for coming into our room was to spite my wife. I don't think I've ever experienced anything as rude or unprofessional as the actions of Dr. O'Sullivan that night. It was awful.

Happy Hour Trickery! Be aware that the happy hour only applies to the "Saloon" area.  This is an area that has practically no view to the lovely outside surroundings.  I went thinking I could enjoy some discounted prices on food and drink while enjoying the sunset with my wife.  False.  Pick 1.  You can't have both. Beyond this trickery, the place is pretty cool.  The slide is fun, and it's neat to do some dancing by the live band.  The cotton candy is for dinner guests only, so they won't give you cotton candy if you enjoy the happy hour prices. The saloon area did have table shuffle board, which is fun. So I liked the experience, but I felt like the happy hour promotion was a bit of a bait-and-switch scam.  Also, I really did not like the tri-tip pieces slathered in red-hot spicy sauce.  The beef tasted like tough chunks of chuck roast, and the sauce tasted like burning.  That's it.  It was too spicy to know whether or not it tasted good.   The Philly cheese-steak sandwich and fries were bland.  Once we added salt to the meal, the flavor was dramatically improved.  The sweet potato fries were good (we got the sweet potato fries as an appetizer before we realized the sandwich would come with fries).   There was only one waitress serving the saloon area, so I had to go on several missions to get more water, find salt, and eventually pay my bill. The place is a mixed bag.  My advice would be to eat before you go, and then just enjoy the live music and the view of Phoenix from South Mountain.

I love the Kilt Lifter and the Southwest Burger, and the beer-battered fries are bomb!  I get extra sweet jalape√±o sauce to dip the fries in, and it's great!

Gelato Spot consistently serves up delicious desserts at an uncomfortably high price.  My wife and I typically share a large shake that allows you to choose three scoops of gelato.  Our most recent shake was comprised of two scoops of coconut gelato and one scoop of Chocolate Caramel Fudge Brownie.  It was exquisite.  We got my kids a two-scoop to share, and spent over $10.

Orange Chicken too Spicy! The orange chicken was much spicier than normal.  I'm not sure if this location uses a different recipe than other locations, but it was too spicy for my wife and kids to eat.  I ordered orange chicken because it is typically sweet and delicious, with maybe a little zing, but nothing all that spicy.  We recently had orange chicken from another Panda Express location, and it was mild enough for my wife and kids to eat.  I'm assuming you go to Panda for the orange chicken, so be aware this location serves up the spicy variety.

In-N-Out Burger is great!  Their simple menu and fast service make it my number one fast food destination.  I love the double-double animal style, which is where they add grilled onions, extra sauce, and a pickle.  It's great.  And the fries are a great value as well.  You get a lot of fries for under $2.

Max Sport Grille offers a great lunch menu where you can get a sandwich/burger with fries and a drink for $5-$7.  With tip, I can enjoy a full meal at a sit-down restaurant for under $10.  I like that they have trivia you can play, and there's usually some good sports to watch on the many televisions that surround you.  The food is decent.  The fries are really good.  They're the big, crispy seasoned kind.  Yum.

Slow Service and Overpriced  Two and a half hours and $136 for 10oz of alcoholic beverages, 6 tator tots, flatbread, dry chicken and cold steak.  I went here with my wife for our 5-yr dating anniversary.  We had a $50 gift card, and I naively came here thinking we would have a "free" meal, but it didn't even cover half the price of our dining experience. The drinks we got were good, but they just cost too much for the tiny little glass of cocktail you get.  My wife's amaretto sour couldn't have been more than 2 or 3 ounces, and it cost $15.  So yeah, you pay a lot for little cutesy cocktails. The tator tots and flatbread were probably the best things we got ($20 for those two items). My wife got the herb roasted chicken for $24 and the chicken was pretty bland and dry.  I got the flat-iron steak ($30), which tasted really good.  The only problem was it was cold-well, cool rather.  But it was as if the steak had been sitting on my plate for 25 minutes before I got it, which may be just what happened.  It took an hour to get our food after we ordered it.  After 55 minutes of waiting, I had to leave to go re-fill our parking meter, so I got to get some exercise in the middle of our dining experience.  It was like our outside table was forgotten.   Our waiter was great, but he had a bunch of inside tables, so we just hardly ever saw him.  My water glass was usually empty, and we were typically waiting a while before we could order something. The atmosphere is cool, and I did enjoy the tator tots and the taste of my steak.  If the whole meal had been closer to $50, and if the service had been faster, I could give this place 4-5 stars probably.  But as it was, it was just too expensive for what we got.

QT offers great gas prices and drink prices.  I recommend their frozen cappuccino.  It is delicious.  The service is good and there is hardly ever any wait.

I went to the Vig Monday night and enjoyed some excellent food and a great atmosphere.  I appreciate that the Fillmore burger is on sale on Mondays after 6pm.  It's a great burger, and I loved it!  It was a little odd that I was charged $1 to have my onions grilled. The atmosphere is great, but the music is a bit too loud and I couldn't hear people across the table from me. I recommend the Vig for the tasty food and the nice atmosphere.
