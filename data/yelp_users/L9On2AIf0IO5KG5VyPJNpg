Great place. In the perfect location for bars, clubs, restaurants, and shopping.  And the prices are VERY good.  It's where I refer all my guests to stay when they come visit.

Tons of room and friendly staff. I love the way I feel when I go to the W.  I live in Scottsdale but I'll stay here every once in awhile for a "staycation"  The outdoor pool has a vegas feel and the crowd is quality! Easy to talk to people and overall good times. Careful in the summer though!!! The ground is like an oven! Bring sandals!

The workers there are super sweet and pleasant. The yogurt is always fresh and they change their flavors constantly.  I really like this place.

The staff is absolutely terrible. I tried some clothes on and no one helped, the girl at the front was too busy texting her friends.  Everything was overpriced and the quality was total garbage. I wore my shirt once and the stitching started coming undone.  I will never buy affliction again.  Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Sneaky liars, they charged my card a $50 "enhancement fee" without warning. Just to update their new club. I already pay a ton to work out here, why do they need to charge  even more to enhance their club. That's what the monthly fee is for. I will be canceling my membership!
