The staff was very nice. The nachos are amazing. We ordered fish tacos, they were horrible. The fish was over cooked and the tortillas were hard. My husband ordered chicken with gravy and eggs, the biscuits were hard as a rock, eggs over cooked, little to no gravy. Bloody Mary's were ok. Again the staff was very friendly.

Despite all the comments about a smelly restaurant we decided that people tend to exaggerate and we would give it a chance. There is no exaggeration this place smells like a sewer and has flys everywhere.  We could not stay to sample the food the odor was unbearable.

First visit to this restaurant the food was good. Accommodated a family of 10. Food was hot seemed fresh.   However,   My husband and I came here for lunch. The food was cold I had beef and broccoli, frys, wontons, fried rice, chow mein, and a chicken dish. Steam was coming from the table however everything I put in my plate was cold. I spoke with the manager a gentleman. He proceeded to tell me I was lying he then laughed and told me there is steam it can't be cold. He never got a thermometer and checked the temperature of the food. I will not be returning to this restaurant based on this experience. We have been here before and didn't have this type of experience. $21.80 for a meal I could not eat.

You know the foods horrible when you start the review with, "the waitress was very friendly". The chips were pretty good. Salsa was spicier than expected. The carne asada tastes like boiled meat with no flavor at all. The adoba tasted like boiled meat with chili powered. Beans and rice weren't too shabby. Service was slow. Margaritas tasted like a cheap party mix.  I suppose all I can say is that the food will make a turd ;).

Not enough seating to enjoy the experience. They do not serve food, bad idea.
