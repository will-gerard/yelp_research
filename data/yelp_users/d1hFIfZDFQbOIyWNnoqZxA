I used to go to this barbershop quite frequently. I do want to support businesses in Phoenix who are either gay owned and/or gay friendly. This barbershop definitely does that and for this I commend them. However, I've had two miserable haircuts in a row. On top of that, I had asked them about their promotion that they routinely send emails about. I no longer new the number that was assigned to me when I registered. He could not help me with that. Puzzled I left. In any case, I don't think I will return.

I am a very frequent Starbucks visitor. Yes, it is a big chain and do prefer to frequent locally owned shops, I go to Starbucks because overall they are generally consistent. I frequently drink chai soy lattes. How difficult could this to be to make. Consistently,  they are terrible at this one particular starbucks. I don't know why. I hope who ever reads this reviews from Starbucks finds out. And if they're not reading this.. "tisk, tisk"

I've love the atmosphere of Copper Star. Fun place to go with a friend and chat. Not a place to do work though. The last three times, I could not get online or the connection timed out.. The last time I was there everyone with a laptop left. Would gladly spend more time there and my $, but often go to a coffee place to work. Therefore now Starbucks, which is tolerable, gets my cash. Get your WIFI working man and stay open a little later and I'll be back. Know tons of others who would be back too. Every coffee place that used to be open late is now gone under! You have a loyal clientele, and I will come back just to hang out...

I recently visited Copper Star again. Thank you for fixing the Wi-Fi. It worked great. I will definitely be stopping by more often. This is a great place to meet friends or do a little work  or just hang out. The food is always great and your cookies/cup cakes/brownies are fantastic.

Whatever to Copper Star? It used to be so good. The desserts are hit or miss but mostly miss. The outside area is never clean or swept.
