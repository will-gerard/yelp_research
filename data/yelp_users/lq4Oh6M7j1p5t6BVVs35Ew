UGH!  Utter Disgust.  I recently moved to the Phoenix/West Valley area and as I'm driving around, looking for somewhere to eat, I see this hole-in-the-wall mexican drive-thru on the side of the road. Most of the best mexican food is found in some of the dirtiest, grimiest spots so I was all for tryin this place out... so I pull into the drive-thru and theres a guy standing outside, next to the menu, just staring at me. It takes me a minute to realize that he's going to be taking my order. That shoulda been a red flag but I ignored it, ordered my food and pulled up to the window. Waited a good 20 minutes... grrreeeeaaaat...... finally get my food (carne asada burrito & adobada fries) and I drive home. By the time I get home (about 10 minutes away), I pick  up my bag and theres a PUDDLE of grease sitting at the bottom of the bag. It literally had to be about 3/4 to a full CUP of grease!! SO GROSS! But i'm STARVING and i'm definitely not going to drive all the way back. So, I get rid of as much grease as possible and I eat the food. I had the fries. My wife had the burrito. Aside from the grease bomb that had exploded on my meal, I guess the food wasnt TOO horrible. Definitely not as good at Federico's or Filiberto's... but not HORRIBLE...  The next day, at work, I get this INTENSE stomach pain and knots in my belly. I end up having to leave work early because it hurts so bad. I ended up vomiting VIOLENTLY for the next 24 hours.   NEVER AGAIN!

I've tried just about every burger on the menu and each one was amazing. You cant go wrong ordering food here. Not quite 5 stars, but close.

I'm not much of a coffee drinker myself, but my wife is. Sometimes when she would go to starbucks, she'd bring one back for me.  Anyways, I drove by Bad Ass one day and told her we should give it a shot... you know? break the starbucks monotony.  The first time we went, I made the mistake of getting a drink made with dark chocolate... Not bad... just not for me. I've never been a dark chocolate fan and it just made the drink really bitter to me... but I wanted to give them another chance. And I'm really happy we did.  So far, I've had the one with pralines/honey... loved it. the one with coconut/macadamia... loved it. the one with white chocolate/tiramisu... loved it!  A couple notable differences from starbucks that I really enjoy: - Bad Ass uses coffee cubes, not ice cubes! So your drink doesnt get watered down as the ice melts. Genius! - The price!! A regular 16oz drink runs about $3 at Bad Ass, compared to starbucks' $6... and military gets 25% off all purchases. My wife and I can get 2 iced coffees for 5 dollars and change. Can't beat that.  My wife and I have recently caught ourselves sayin "Starbucks who?!"  I'm definitely a fan.

I've only been to this venue once or twice, but both times were fun. They bring some great acts into the city. The venue itself is really chill. Good drink prices and plenty of room to move around.  Keep up the good work.

Ok. I just got back from my 3rd trip to this Federicos since it opened about a month ago and I am thoroughly pleased.  The staff is extremely professional. The service is VERY fast. The facility is sparkling clean. There's always plenty of seating. And even best, the food is amazing.  I've had the california burrito, adobada fries, and the chicken tacos. All 3 meals were made perfectly and served very quickly.   *Note: Any military members stationed at Luke... This is the best mexican food you will find close enough to base to visit during your lunch break... and military gets a free medium drink with their meal*  The people here work very hard and they deserve our support.

So I FINALLY made it down to El Coquito. I drove all the way out from Surprise.... and I was NOT disappointed.  The food at El Coquito is sooooo good!! It's got a very homemade taste to it. I had the pernil and my wife had mofongo. We both shared with each other. We even had to get some food to go because it was so good and we live so far. And I washed it down with some ice cold CoCo Rico... mmmm... Next time, I'm getting the guanabana.  I've got family in both NYC and Puerto Rico and the food here is by far the closest I have ever gotten to my family's home cooking. If I lived closer, I'd eat here at least once a week!  The only thing I missed was that they were all out of alcapurrias when I went... and the server said once they run out for the day, they wont have anymore, which is a little disappointing, but it IS a little mom n pop restaurant so I understand.   Overall, I'm VERY satisfied with the friendly service and comfortable atmosphere. I WILL be back soon!

2nd worst fast food experience of my life.   At the drive thru menu, we ordered 2 Double-Downs and a 10piece boneless meal w/ mac n cheese and mashed potatoes (the cashier repeated our order back to us). Once we got to the window, we had to repeat our entire order for the cashier as if he didnt catch any of it the first time. I thought that was a red flag but took it as a sign that at least they wouldnt be messing up our order... NOPE!  We got home and opened our food only to realize that the mac n cheese our toddler had been begging for was switched out with cole slaw! As if that wasnt enough to irritate me, ALL of the chicken was way overcooked, dry, and tough... And since bad things come in 3's, it's only right that our double-downs were horrific too. I've had at least a dozen double-downs in my life and this was the only time I've ever seen KFC use what was basically 3"x1" chicken strips. Also, they were served without bacon.  I was STARVING when I ordered my food but had absolutely ZERO appetite when I got home and saw the food. I was so upset about my $35 order that I actually called them. I spoke with the shift leader and what was his solution to the problem?? Free food!! Why the hell would I want MORE of that "food"?!! Absolutely ridiculous.  And the icing on the cake? When my wife drove back to speak with someone in person, the place was closed!! The door said they close at 11pm... Ummmm, it was 10:15pm. Seriously?!! Corporate WILL be getting a phone call first thing in the morning.

First time eating here. I just ordered the adobada fries (yes, you can do that). Most places allow you to sub out the often dry, unseasoned carne asada for the more flavorful adobada (pork). It makes a world of difference. Anyways, back to the review. I just ordered the fries and an horchata. The fries were very good and the meat cooked perfectly. Only complaint is that I wish they threw in a lime or 2. Most places put a lime wedge in with the fries. Not a big deal. I just assumed they did and didnt ask when they asked if I wanted salsa. I went drive-thru so I didnt find out til later, otherwise it wouldve been a non-issue.   The horchata was also very good, not watered down like another review claims. Maybe they changed their recipe? Maybe that person just went on a day when a new guy was making it? Or maybe I just got lucky. Who knows, but it was good, and I consider myself a bit of an horchata connoisseur. *nose up*  But to make an unnecessarily long story short, I am very satisfied with the food and will be returning soon.
