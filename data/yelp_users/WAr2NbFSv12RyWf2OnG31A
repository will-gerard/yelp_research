Not happy with this establishment. Food is overpriced, while servers are friendly- not enough staffed on a Friday night. Was given tabs before we were ready, causing most to not bother with desserts here. Alcohol is the only redeeming quality here.

I could not say ENOUGH good things about Carmen. She's professional, friendly, and so attentive to your needs. Environment is incredibly clean and calm, also. When it comes to your skin care, I highly doubt you could find anyone as great as Carmen.
