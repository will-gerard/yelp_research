I seem to be going to Tom's Restaurant & Tavern about every two weeks. where  I meet my friend for lunch.  I love this place and our main waiter, Frank, Jr.  not only is he so professional, courteous and funny, but  becomes your friend right away.  You would think you have known him forever.  Their food is delicious and they have a huge menu.  It's very nice because you can either choose to sit outside on the patio like a cafe' setting, or sit inside the restaurant.  They are reasonably priced and most of the people that eat there are on their lunch hour, so they do hurry to get your food out.  I highly suggest you try Tom's Restaurant and Tavern the next time you are down on Central Ave.

I took my dog to East Maryland Animal Hospital and I was extremely pleased with their services.  My little Cock-a-Poo had gone to  Banfield and after a few visits and a total run-around and emptying my pocketbook, I took her to East Maryland Animal Hospital and they treated her Thyroid problem and some other things and I'm happy to say this sick little dog is so much better now.  I found the employees to be so attentive and caring and I did not have to wait forever either.  When I call once a month to refill her prescription, whoever I speak with is so courteous and the medication is ready when they say it will be.  I also used the 50% off coupon and luckily had no problem.

I was recently at John C. Lincoln Deer Valley Hospital for congestive heart failure and I give so many applauds to this hospital.  I have been in there several times before and they just get better and better.  Everything pleases me about this hospital.  They try to make it a good experience. From the doctors and nurses to the cooks and the maintenance people, they are there for you and care so much.  Thank you JCLDV for everything.

Yesterday, September 19th, I decided to go and eat lunch at Red Lobster. I knew I would have a delicious lunch, but I never knew I would meet one of the few "beautiful" people I've ever seen.  I was quickly escorted to my seat and was asked what I wanted to drink.  Within a few minutes, my drink was brought to me by the most beautiful young man I have ever seen.  Talk about one way for a restaurant to get more business, just hire guys that look like this.  He was so charming and could have been a model.  He came to my table and took my order with a huge smile on his face.  This guy was tall, dark, handsome and charming.  He had the curliest dark hair a slight beard, gorgeous eyes and a smile for every moment.  He was so kind and considerate.  I finally put my order in and I received it in a proper amount of time.  The food was delicious and before I was finished, my beautiful waiter came by and asked how the cocktail sauce was, since I had not eaten any of it, so I told him I had some health problems and had to watch what I ate.  He was very understanding.  At the end of the meal and after I had paid the bill, he came to my table with that smile and held his hand out to me.  Now, I thought he was just being charming and wanted to shake my hand, so I shook his hand and said it was nice meeting him and he was so charming, BUT, as I sat watching television last night, I realized he was probably going to help me get up.  Since I've been married for 38 years and never have had that kind of treatment, I really feel stupid now.  Anyway,  I highly suggest this Red Lobster.  Not only because of this gorgeous young man, who did not have on a wedding ring for you single ladies and was probably in his late 20s or early 30s, but for the food and restaurant itself.

Yesterday I visited this particular Target and thought I would check out their new food section, which just opened.  I also had several coupons from Target for their food products, so I wanted to use them.  My first quest was to buy some grapes.  The coupon said $1.00 off for a pound or more.  I didn't see a container holding a pound of grapes,so I asked a young man who was working in that area and he said they didn't have pound containers, but they do have 2 pound containers.  I didn't want 2 pounds, plus of course, they cost more.  Okay, forget the grapes.  Then I got a 3 pound bag of apples, which was fine with the coupon for another dollar off.  I just sliced one of those apples this morning and the damn apple was brown inside.  It looked to me like all fruits are already packaged (I could be wrong), so you can't pick out what you want.  I was expecting cheaper prices, but with sales, I'm sure Fry's and other stores are about the same.  I know people who complain about Fry's produce, but I'm not going to, they are far better than Target.  The only good thing I can say about their new food area is that it is very neat and clean.  I guess if you are in Target and need a particular item, then it will be good to get an item or two, but I will never do my whole grocery shopping there.

Finally I found a dog.  It is not a Cockapoo like I have written about, but I did get one.  She is a Scottish Wheaten Terrier Mix and a true love.  She is 8 years old.  I got her from the Humane Society.    I was told that most dogs get kennel cough when you get them from the Humane Society and yes, she did.  I took her for her "free" visit at the VCA and they gave her antibiotics and cough tablets and true, it was for free.  If you have read my past posts on my last dog who passed away and Banfield, you will know what I'm talking about.  Anyway, I just took her back yesterday for her booster shot and again, they didn't even charge me for the office visit.    They are the nicest people there and everyone is so happy.  The technicians are great and so was Dr. Martin.  She knew what she was talking about and I really appreciate how they act and what they do.  Thank you very much for a great experience VCA and Missie, my new doggy thanks you too.

I was in the Fry's Electronics on Thunderbird and was very disappointed with their sales people.  They may have great deals and when you can get the attention of someone and get to the right department, it may be a good store.  My visit was upsetting because I would have to go up to some guys and asked them where a certain item was and they would just say what aisle it was on.  I went over toward that aisle and asked some guys just standing there and again they say the aisle number.  I finally was at the back of the store by the computers and just standing there.  There were two salesmen just standing there talking and one was bouncing a ball.  They never ever asked if they could help me.  I finally had to say "Excuse Me" to get their attention.  Then they acted like they could have cared less about helping me.  Sorry to say, they lost me as a customer.  I'll go to Circuit City where they WANT to help their customers.

I have to give huge kudos to the Nordstrom Department Store.  I have rarely ever gone in there before, but one of my daughters wanted a particular leather jacket for Christmas.  I went to the store itself, but they did not have this particular jacket in the store, so the clerk "cheerfully" looked it up for me online and ordered it for me.  She gave me all the information I needed and this was in a very timely manner by the way.  Christmas came and my daughter opened her gift and the jacket did not fit.  Of course I kept my receipt, so we took it back to the same Nordstrom store that I got it from and told them we needed to return it and order the jacket one size larger.  Again, the clerk did this transaction within five minutes "cheerfully" and it was taken care of.  This was a different clerk too.    As of today, my daughter had not received the jacket yet and was concerned, so since I still have the receipt, I called Nordstrom and spoke with Customer Service.  The person I spoke with actually made my day and made me "Happy".  She was so sweet and I gave her all the information from my receipt and she actually tracked the jacket for me.  According to her, it's in transit at this time and my daughter should receive the jacket tomorrow.  I swear, I am sitting here smiling because this girl actually had class, a brain, and was a sweetheart.  Yeah for my evening :-)

To continue with my quest of finding 21 books of the first Harry Potter book for my daughter's 5th grade class, I finally ended up at Bookman's.  I don't know why I did not start there in the first place.  When I asked for the book, they had about six on the shelf and then one of the employees told me she thought another employee had a box of them in the back.  Excitement immediately filled my soul.  I kept thinking, could it be possible that I could get all the books my daughter needed from one place now?  The employee came out with a box full of Volume #1 Harry Potter books and I was thrilled.  I told the lady I could just hug her and she told me she was so happy that she made me happy.  They are the nicest people in there, plus they gave me a 10% discount too, even though I'm not the teacher, but they believed me that I was getting them for my daughter, who is the teacher.  I would completely and highly recommend Bookman's for your reading needs.  They are fabulous and thank you so much.

"Hot Dogs and Cool Cats" is definitely the place to go for having your pet groomed, if you live in North Phoenix.  I used to take my dog, Cassey, to PetsMart and the last time the girl said she had such trouble grooming her because she is so old and her skin is loose.  I had heard about "Hot Dogs and Cool Cats" from a friend of mine.  I took Cassey over to the groomer just so they could look at her and I could make sure they could groom her without her (the dog) being traumatized.  They said there was no problem, so her appointment was for Tuesday.  I took her in and told them a few things about her, but I forgot to tell them they could use the muzzle.  Sure enough, I went to pick her up and was told that she was quite the "biter".  I said, "Oh no, did she try and bite you?" and they said "Yes", so they did have to put the muzzle on her (I think they were traumatized).  The whole time I was talking to the groomer, Cassey just sat there looking at me...she knew we were talkiing about her.  Anyway, I want to give a ton of cudos to the groomers for putting up with Cassey's horrible manners.  I know my dog is old (14), but I felt bad that she was such a naughty girl.  Thank you for the good job and how nice you were to Cassey "Hot Dog and Cool Cat" groomers :-)

I have to agree with every post that has been written.  I have taken 3 dogs to Hot Dogs & Cool Cats now and each dog has been groomed beautifully.  The staff is remarkable and as others have said, Terry, the owner, is an exceptional person.  She remembers who you are and even makes you feel very welcome.  I will always continue taking my baby Missy to them.

I have been going to Fry's Food & Drug Store since the place opened, so that has been for at least 33 years.  I realize that improvements must be made, but my Lord, they do not need to change every freaking isle and have it make no sense at all.  If you are going there to get all your groceries, it might be a different story, but holy crap, if you just need a few things to make a certain recipe, plan on being in that place for a half an hour to an hour.  I had finally found everything except the pasta and when I finally found the isle where it was located, I had to pass through what had to of been the head honchos and then probably the head of each department.  One would think they would have a conference room instead of meeting in the isle or go into the back room, but I guess not.  I literally told them that the store sucked now.  I told them everybody was ticked off that they moved everything except the produce and the frozen foods.  Oh wait, the cheese was still in the same place.  Anyway, I still hadn't found the peanuts for my husband, so I asked them where they were.  One guy tells me what isle they were on and I said that was fine and dandy, but you freaking don't have any isle numbers up.  One of the execs told me to follow him and then in his nonchalant attitude asks me why I was upset.  I told him it's not just me, nobody can find anything and it made no sense.  I asked him why they had to change everything and he pointed to the stupid floor.  So, they had to change EVERYTHING around because they put new flooring in....what BS.  Anyway, I'm done with that Fry's, even though it's close to my house. It wouldn't be bad because of the attitude I was given.  So much for good customer service.

I have gone to Sylvia's for many years and it is apparent there is new management who have taken over the business.  When I came in, I was seated at a table over by the television set, which was fine.  I was facing the window, so to my right was a group of men already eating their lunch and to my left, was an empty table.  I was given a menu when I sat down,but  no chips, drink order or anything.  A few minutes after I was seated, the same lady seated a man and a woman and immediately gave them their chips.  The next thing I see, they had their drinks and then that same lady (in glasses) was taking their order.  I still had not even received any chips.  I was somewhat ticked off at this point and picked up my purse and left.  I did not say anything, because I am NOT the waitress, I was the customer.  Oh well, they not only lost one customer, but three others because my family would go there too.

This place does not deserve any stars whatsoever.  Last Friday, Feb. 8th, we took our dog to Banfield because her skin was extremely dry and she was coughing.  To make it short, we ended up spending $450.00 for services rendered.  These people are extremely high priced, yet they want people to bring their animals to them.  The Vet said that he would call and give up the results of the blood test the next day, but to no avail.  We figured we wouldn't hear from them the next day because it was a Saturday.  Monday we didn't hear anything, so today, Tuesday the 12th, I called and of course they had the results.  The receptionist said the Vet would call me back.  It was about half an hour and he called.    He told me the result of the test (as far as I could understand him...he was from India) and said I needed to come in and get some pills for our dog's Thyroid.  I went and got the pills, but while I was standing there, I told the receptionist that I did not blame her, but the Vet should have called us.  We paid so much money for their services and I should not have had to call them for the lab results.  I told her I was extremely disappointed with their company.  Then she said she agreed with me 100% and the Vet should have called me.  I highly recommend you do not go to Banfield, which is a part of PetsMart, find an independent Vet.

I have written about Banfield before, but we have another saga to this ongoing problem.  I am now giving up on this stupid place and urge you guys to NEVER go there either  We have always taken our dog to Banfield Animal Hospital/Clinic in PetsMart for her vacinations and check-ups. In February of 2008, we took her again because she was acting very lethargic, her skin was very scaly, no appetite, etc. They did a blood work-up and said her Thyroid was acting up again. With all the bloodwork and office/vet visit, it cost us $450.00. Her Thyroid was high, so they gave us medication, but said we needed to come back in two weeks and have her blood tested again. We did this at least two more times.  On Sat., April 5th, our dog was very sick and would keep her tail between her legs, not eat, was extremely lethargic, would hunch her back when she would stand up, and was constipated also. All these symptoms and more were told to the vet and we were told that all these were symptoms that her Thyroid was still out of whack. By this time, it had been 2 1/2 weeks since her blood test and we were never contacted with the results. They claimed they never got the results and had to call the place that did the tests and they had to run the test again. The vet tells me she didn't have a clue as to why our dog was keeping her tail between her legs. She said our dog must be nervous. Our dog has never ever done that before. Anyway, the vet sent us home just saying all this was from the Thyroid problem.  We brought our dog home and on Sun., (April 6th) I woke up and there was blood all over the quilt my dog sleeps on. We had to take her to an Emergency Animal Clinic and found out she had burst an anal gland. They took care of that to the tune of $158.00 and immediately she was back to her normal self, which we were grateful for.. The papers said we should take her to the vet the next day, so I called Banfield, and was told I couldn't get in until this afternoon because they were full with appointments. I said I needed to get in earlier than that, so they said to come in right away. I got in there and there wasn't a soul in the place.  A different vet than we had on Saturday came in and I told her how ticked off I was at the results of Saturday's visit and then what happened on Sunday. She checked our dog and made excuses as to why the other vet did not check her bottom. I did not agree with her and told her how I felt. I told this vet that I felt I should not have to pay for this office visit and finally she agreed, so that was one good part, since we have paid close to $1,000.00 since February. The part that ticked me off the most though, was having our dog in there on Saturday and they never checked our dog in the area they should have and had no idea why her tail was between her legs and did a horrible job.  I had called PetsMart groomers to cancel our dog's haircut because of these problems and told the groomer what was going on and she asked me who the vet was and I told her Banfield. She said never to go to Banfield again. They are very bad and overcharge the customer tremendously. I can only say, do not take your dog there. They must hire their vets from the bottom of the barrel.  You should put Banfield Pet Hospital Corporation into your search engine and go to a site that shows "I'm Pissed".  You will see what this corporation has done to animals and what people think of Banfield.  Again, I'm marking one star because I have to in order to post this.

I had never been in a Culver's until yesterday and I thought the salad I had, was very good.  When you go in, you go to the counter and place your order and then they bring it out to your table. We didn't have to wait that long for our order either.  It is a very nice and clean restaurant and all the people are very friendly.  When we left the restaurant, their marquee showed "Pork Tenderloin" sandwiches.  You have no idea how excited I was.  There are very few places in Phoenix that have this type of sandwich, which is mainly served in the Midwest, so I am elated.  I didn't realize there were so many Culver Restaurants in the area and because of Yelp, I see there is one even closer to where I live, besides this particular location.  I highly recommend this restaurant and am very happy they came to Phoenix.

I had the opportunity to eat lunch at P.F. Changs Chinese Bistro yesterday (4/28).  I have been going there for several years and I liked it then, but the changes they have made are just great.  The employees there have always been nice, but it seems they really go out of their way to make you even more comfortable now.  When my waiter came to the table to take my order, he asked me if I wanted egg-drop soup or another kind.  I was so surprised because they have never offered soup as part of your meal beforehand and there was no extra charge for it.  They have also changed the way you get your entre.  They used to bring a bowl of white or brown rice for everyone to share and then your entre would be on another plate.  Now, at least for lunch, they call it a lunch bowl and everything is put on one plate.   You are not having to put each item on another plate yourself, like you used to.  Their food is delicious and I almost always get the Crispy Honey Chicken, which I love.  They have a large menu with many different dishes.  I highly suggest if you are looking for a fabulous Chinese Bistro, that you try P.F. Chang's.

I know that Wal-Mart gets a bad rap at times, but I need to report how nice they were to me the other day.  I went in there to buy some Christmas presents and found everything I needed and went to pay for everything.  I apparently did not take everything off the kyosk of bags and left one package there.  When I got home and these items were not in the back of my vehicle, I went back down there.  They told me to just go and get two more pair of the item I was missing.  I really felt they were so nice in doing that.  Thank you Wal-Mart.

I eat at "Bagel Nosh" once a week with my friend and I find it to be superior.  You have so many choices as to what you can order and their food is delicious. They not only serve bagels plain or as sandwiches, but also offer many wraps, as-well-as other items.  They have a well rounded menu.  All the people that work there are fabulous and you feel as though they are your best friend.  The restaurant itself is always very clean and makes you feel at home.  I highly suggest you all try this place out.

Because of the hail storm that we had, we needed new shingles on our roof.  We called Hays Roofing, Inc.and they came out in a very timely period and gave us an estimate for the roof.  We had already had it checked by our insurance adjuster and we were paid by the insurance company.  I thought Hays did an excellent job and were constantly in contact with us, until they could come out and do the roof.  After the shingles were put on, one of the men from the company came out to make sure things were completed correctly and it was.  To my surprise, the other day we received a thank-you card from them, which I felt was rather classy.  I would highly recommend Hays Roofing for people that need work done on their roof.
