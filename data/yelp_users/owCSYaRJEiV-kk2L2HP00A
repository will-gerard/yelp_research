After waiting for over an hour (also with 2 little kids )I finally get my $16.00 spicy chicken pasta and the noodles are hard... this isn't what I would expect after waiting so long. At this point I have no desire of waiting for them to bring me a new plate.  They didn't even offer to take it off the bill! There are tons of places to choose in this area I'm  not sure I will ever go back.

Food is average.. $10 for a slice and small wings topped with bad service!

Thought I would give them a 2nd chance... Bad idea! Employees make you feel like your putting them out for ordering overpriced pizza. this place will be out of business If  the owners don't  make a change quickly.

Never judge a book by its cover.. This place is amazing!!! I have been back multiple times and haven't been disappointed. Tacos, burritos and burgers are all outstanding.

Glad to have another great restaurant in Downtown Mesa. The Cuban was amazing but, let me tell you about the Banana pudding.. Out of this world!! Glad I made the stop today for lunch.
