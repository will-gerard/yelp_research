As much as I love living in South Phoenix, one of the things we lack here is good pizza. Whenever, I'm on the north side and wanting good pizza I stop at Pat's. My two favorite pizzas are just a plain pepperoni and their garlic chicken pesto. The pepperoni is simple grace, fresh tomato flavor bursting through the browned cheese flavor and crisp crunchy crust. It is sublime simplicity.  The garlic chicken pesto is the opposite side of the spectrum. A melody of flavor; garlic, pesto, jalape√±os that provide a tiny bit of heat and another dimension to the flavor. It's all rounded out with little pieces of chicken and chopped fresh tomatoes, all on top of their crispy delicate crust.   Pats is built for take out, but they do have a few tables. I drove the pizza from their address to my house near south mountain and it was still hot and crunchy. Give them a try.

I'm kicking myself. I've driven past this little joint with the bright red and yellow exterior for years...like 7 years.  I've read the reviews, but it still took me a couple of months to get brave enough to go in. I've eaten several times a the Thai place just down the block. I finally did it based on my search for some good chili fries. I ordered chili fries and a double cheese burger. These are real hamburger patties. They come standard with ketchup, mayo, mustard, pickles, tomato, lettuce. It was a moist grilled patty. The chili cheese fries were covered in a rich chili, didn't taste as if it was from a can, the chili was covered with cheese and chopped white onions. The ambiance, well, it's a hole on the wall, but good chili fries aren't usually in fancy restaurants. I'm looking forward to going again soon!

We have been frequenting this place a few times a month since we first "discovered" it. I kid you not, he makes the best chili cheese fries. I can't even think of any other place after trying his chili cheese fries.   My other favorite is the "country" cheese burger. not sure why it's called that but the richness of the thousand island balances well with the smokey flavor of the burger. The onion rings are lightly seasoned with some black pepper and paprika in the batter. My son and husband swear by the catfish, and they get the potato salad to go with it.   Yes, the service can be a bit slow, but not in the way like they are ignoring you, but in the "there is only one guy manning the orders, grill and register" way. Which I appreciate and is often seen in these little neighborhood joints.   I will also say, that the owner remembers me when I come in, which I find pretty amazing considering he must see more than a few people each day.   Bring a few quarters with you, while I'm waiting I like to play "Black Rose, Queen of the Sea", good old fashioned pinball. He has other games too, but that one is my favorite.

We came here for our friend's birthday. It was her first birthday after spending the last year in the hospital and rehab. We were looking forward to celebrating.    My husband and I arrived a few minutes after the rest of the party. I should have known there were going to be problems as we never received menus. We borrowed them from others at the table. I ordered our drinks. They brought my husband Root beer instead of Coke.   The biggest issue for me was once our orders started to arrive. There were 9 in our party. We received 4 dinners, then about 15 mins later, 2 more, and then about 10 minutes later the remaining 3. The last 3 that were served were our birthday guest, her husband, and the 4 year old at the table. The birthday girl was still waiting on her meatballs, but we couldn't flag down our server.  One of the dinners was served cold. The 4 year old's pizza was all bread, very little cheese, and like many 4 year old kids,  she  was really only interested in eating the cheese off the top.    The manager came over to ask how everything was, and we let him know that we were still missing the meatballs, and one of the meals was cold. My friend didn't want the meal remade because of the time it had already taken to get the first one!  I explained to the manager that it was my friends birthday and I asked him if he could "make it special" for her. He said he would make it special.   Make it special apparently meant comping the birthday dessert, which from what I can tell is a service they already provide. However, the waitress initially came over and said the manager had offered dessert due to the poor service. The birthday girl and cold dinner girl ordered dessert, no other desserts were ordered. The waitress came back again and informed us only the birthday dessert was on the house. (Really?! The $5 mini cannoli was going to break the bank?!)  My food was good, I really have no complaints but the service was just horrible. We started dinner at 5pm and didn't leave until after 7:30.  My water was never refilled, actually I don't think anyone at the table had their water refilled. The table set up was difficult to deal with as well, and when we needed to leave the table, we had to walk around the table behind us to get out. It was very tightly cramped with tables, chairs, waitresses and patrons.   As we were leaving, I noticed there were about 20 people waiting to be seated. Had the service been more efficient, those folks wouldn't have had to wait so long to get a table. Carrabba's recently updated it's menu, but that won't help unless they look at their process flow, serve time and space needs to improve the efficiency of service.

We love this place. Phenomenal family ran restaurant. It's been there for probably 25 years. Bin Xio is one of my favorites, my husband loves the spring rolls and the salty plum soda. The Vietnamese Iced Latte is better than any Starshmucks.

Just go. Take a ton of friends. You can't get a better dinner for a better price. My favorite is the pork bun. It's filled with savory ground and shredded pork, and boild egg. The dough is so fluffy and tender, I can't describe it. I haven't had anything here that I didn't enjoy. We go with family and order lots of tasty items to share.

What can I say about this place that hasn't been said already? It's VERY hot food. They do have options that aren't as hot, but they don't sound as good. I have finally found a dish that I can eat which is the bean burro. That might sound funny but it's perfectly seasoned whole beans (just like my Suegra used to make).  The tortilla is soft, fresh, warm. It is a perfect specimen of a bean burro.   I might mention, I'm happy I found something I can eat there, because I do love their Coronarita to drink. It really should be called "the tranquilizer".

My nephew the budding chef invited us for his birthday dinner. He had made reservations 3 days in advance. The party was a large party of about 20 people. I've been to enough restaurants to know that a party this size is usually tag teamed by 2 or more of the wait staff. And that appeared to be what was happening when we first sat down. Then there was some confusion, and they asked for our orders again. Then one of the waitresses never appeared again.   My husband received his cola and some of the folks at the other end of the table received their drinks, but our drinks didn't come for quite some time. Our water was empty, still no drinks, and they hadn't taken our dinner order yet. Waiting, waiting, waiting. Finally our drinks come, and then she disappears and more waiting, and then she takes our orders.   While we did have poor service, I don't believe it was solely the waitress' fault. There seemed to be kitchen issues as well. Our dishes came out one or two at a time. It was really odd.  Eventually, out came ONE (of 3) order of calamari. You would think everything else was on it's way, no, more waiting. Finally, another couple of plates came out, people were trying to figure out if they should be polite and wait, or eat because by then it was past 10pm.   It went on like this for another 3 hours....yes 3...we were the only table left in the restaurant and we hadn't been served completely. Finally the poor waitress is trying to close people out on the tab, while still trying to serve people. I asked her if there wasn't anyone that could help her as she couldn't very well be expected to be in two places. She said there really wasn't and that was what happened.   People were still trying to pay, one couple and ourselves still didn't have part of our meal or our dessert. There were two gentlemen that appeared to be waitstaff. I asked one of them if someone could possibly help our by now frazzled waitress. He said there wasn't. I gave him an incredulous look and said, "can't you see she can't possibly do this by herself and needs help". He begrudgingly agreed to help by getting the remaining portions of our meals, sat them down with a plunk and a look that said he was not happy about helping.   The 1 star is for operational process and service. The food was really quite good, but I was in so much pain from sitting for so long that I couldn't enjoy it. I don't think I have ever seen a restaurant where one person was left on their own with a huge party, and other staff just walking around watching them.

The prices were what attracted me but I should have known you get what you pay for.  I'm big on customer service. It took us well over an hour and half to get everything, even though I had pre-reserved online and there wasn't a line. We were at the counter that long. Part of the delay was that they insisted on the declaration page of my car insurance. The guy at the counter first said "proof of insurance" after my husband walked out to the car brought it back then he said "declaration page". This guy's customer service was just clocking in and out. When I commented that it wasn't  mentioned when I reserved and pre-paid the car, he replied "it's in the terms and agreements but NOBODY reads it"; he later retracted that and said that if we went through carrental.com they may not have used the same terms and agreements.   They have an offer to purchase fuel at a set price. DO NOT DO THIS OPTION if you are not going to use a full tank of gas. There is no refund. I paid $59.58 under the assumption as told by Mr. "clocking my time", that I would only pay the difference of the fuel I used. I asked a couple of times to make sure I understood what I was buying...which apparently I still didn't.   When I returned the car, the guy in the lot said he would be refunding my deposit. I asked about the refund on the fuel and he said they don't do that. I said, "the guy at the counter said I would only be charged for the portion I used."  His surly response was "haven't you ever rented a car before". No, I haven't and I won't be renting one again from this company.   I attempted to call customer service when I returned home, but they said I had to ask for the refund at the counter. I will dispute the charge through my credit card company, it will just be easier.   Don't...just don't....

Living in South Phoenix, we have to travel to get a larger selection of restaurants. We often go to Ahwatukee for dinner but for some reason we have missed this little gem. I was specifically looking for breakfast at 4pm and they serve breakfast all day. I ordered the special which was a light crepe, filled with creme fresh topped with fresh strawberries, bananas, blueberries, I had a pancake too which was served with whipped butter and a very nice thick syrup. Because its fall and it was 4pm, I also had the fall sangria. Light, apple cider flavor with fall spices it was very tasty. Our service was top rate and sitting outside was comfortable. Looking forward to trying more of their menu!

I find Rice Paper to be the standard that is on this section of 7th St, it's overpriced, and leaves me regretting my decision to try something new. I tried the spring rolls which were ok, although over priced. The true disappointment was un the Beef Pho. I swear, they used Steak-ums, or some other pre processed steak.  It tasted frozen. The frozen taste overwhelmed the whole bowl of pho. Nasty.

We were looking for a new place to have brunch this morning. For me, that means breakfast food at lunch time, not some buffet serving squiggly seafood. Luckily, Mark's serves breakfast all day.   The hollandaise and Eggs Benedict were mentioned highly and were part of the reason we decided on this place. By my count there were 9 versions of Eggs Benedict, and they are so accommodating, you could probably get any combination you preferred.  Did I mention accommodating? Excellent service, family owned business where everyone seems to have a vested interest in the business.    I must say I was hesitant to order anything with the hollandaise, because I make a really good hollandaise, and usually I'm disappointed with the sauce anywhere. I must say this is a very close second to my own sauce, and the best at any restaurant in memory.  We tried the Irish, French, and Neptune EB. The hash on the EB, was some of the best at any restaurant, I did think however that the heavier taste of the hash, overwhelmed the light lemony flavor of the hollandaise. It was good, I nearly licked the plate, but I'm not sure it highlighted two good ingredients into greatness. My recommendation would be to start with the plain hollandaise, and work your way from there.   I also ordered a Banana Pecan Waffle. This had fresh sliced banana cooked in a cinnamon syrup. For some reason, I had pictured more like a banana nut bread waffle, not a regular waffle with banana and nuts in top. That was my misconception. I enjoyed the waffle and brought the last quarter home for a snack later. The syrup that the banana and pecans are cooked has quite a bit of cinnamon. It reminded me of the sticky sugar created when you make cinnamon rolls.    Of note, they offer many flavor combinations of tea and coffee. I had the iced ginger peach tea. It was really refreshing and flavorful and they give you a cup to go if you ask.  My son had the Irish Cream coffee. I could smell the vanilla and Carmel notes of the coffee.   Some of the other Yelpers mentioned Christian music, I didn't notice any music, or it wasn't blatantly playing.  But really, does it matter? If the food is good enough (it is) I wouldn't care if they were playing monk chants. In looking for a restaurant on Yelp, someone else was complaining about the Metal being played at another establishment. Proof you can't please everyone.  It is a small place, I wouldnt recommend large parties without giving them some warning.

I thought I'd written a review for Oregano's.  We like Oregano's, normally, the Bellini is my favorite drink ever. Tonight our experience wasn't that good. I've emailed the corporate office, a copy of that email is below.   Tonight my husband and I went to the Oregano's located on Priest and Elliott in Tempe, AZ.   We go to that location a couple times a month.   Tonight we ordered our regular order of Belini, Pepsi, Boom dip, Bollo Pasta, and Italian Stuffed sandwich. On the way through the dining area the wings smelled really good. At first I didn't want to wait for them, then I decided, I'd order them and take them home.   We were out on the patio. As the waitress was packing up our left overs, she kept taking them inside.We heard a commotion just inside the door and I turned around to see a box on the floor with the familiar checked paper sticking out. Four of the wait staff gathered to discuss what to do. I told my husband "they are going to give me the wings like nothing happened".   And that is exactly what they did. They put the wing box on the bottom, my leftover Bollo on top in the bag and set it down. She took my husbands sandwich to box and when she came back. I asked: "was that my wings that just dropped" and the waitress replied "oh but we're getting you a new order".   I'm irritated by this point, the manager came out and said "we've taken the charge off your bill, and we are getting you a FULL order of wings". Well, it was 12 of 14 wings, I had left, so this wasn't much of huge difference for me. I returned the dropped wings. We decided to leave before receiving the wings.   I'm not upset that my wings dropped. I'm upset that they weren't upfront about it, and I'm upset that the manager was acting like she was doing me a favor. What I believe should have happened was; The server should have came to me, said "hey the box dropped, but nothing fell out, we can give you these wings, and take them off your tab, or we can make you new wings but it will take 20 mins". This leaves the options up to me while maintaining the honesty in the relationship.   Please do not make this about the server, this is obviously the influence of bad management as there was more than one server involved.  We won't be back for a while. We're not sure if we should even eat the left overs, who knows what happened out of our eye sight?

Went here last night with my husband, son, and friend. The first thing I noticed was how neat, tidy and clean everything looked even though this is a small restaurant in an aging strip mall.   I had read the reviews and had already decided I wanted the Island Fruity drink from the bar. It was sweet and fruity, with no rum taste. As soon as I saw the Ginger Mint drink I knew that was for my son. The menu and the waitress both warned of the spiciness of the ginger. My son is a huge ginger drink fan, the hotter the better. He loved it.   We started with the PofPof, which is unusual but life is short, eat dessert first. We ordered both the honey and chocolate both of which were tasty.   Our entree's were up next. I had the Yassa Chicken, my husband and friend had the Jerk Chicken, and my son had the Cassava Leaf. Because of the name of the Cassava Leaf, for some reason we picture it as some sort of roll rather than more of a sauce. It was tender chunks of meat in a flavorful sauce. It comes with a starchy dough made to be eaten with the fingers.  The Yassa chicken was so good. For lack of a better description, it's close to a slightly sweet mustard curry. The onions and green peppers are melt in your mouth , and the meat is fork tender.  The jerk chicken was different than any jerk I've had before. It had more of a barbecue flavor but it was still very tasty. We also had the plantains which were perfect.   I'm sure we will return because there are so many things to try.

This was our first trip to this little restaurant. I pass it nearly every day on my way from work and decided tonight was the night to try it. I'm very glad I did! The food was fresh and flavorful. You can tell that everything is made to order and hasn't been sitting in a warming tray. Our goyza arrived at the table hot and crisp! I had the Bulgogi dinner, and I liked it so much I bought another order to go for my son! I can't say fresh enough! It made such a difference in the flavor. Scott had the spicy honey chicken. It was crisp, sweet, and spicy. Again, it was made fresh...it hadn't been sitting around and still be that crisp ! He also ordered the Philly sushi roll. I felt for the price it was a decent value and quite tasty! We will be going back !

First time here. Everything was delish! They even gave us sour dough bread and a decadent dessert. The iced tea was probably the best ice had anywhere, which may sound silly, but if a restaurant can't do the simple things well, why try anything else. This place does it all right.

To me this is like all Fox restaurants, the concept is wonderful, the execution..meh.  This was my first visit. I had the enchilada. We were warned that the enchilada was "stacked", and I'm ok with that. Actually, the enchilada and how it was served was really good. I liked the small cast iron pan that was perfectly sized to a corn tortilla. The cheese, lots of it and melty too. The sauce, that was where this took a drastic turn for the worse. Enchilada means "in chili". The sauce wasn't chili, I'm not sure it was even something like red pepper, maybe more tomato, and sweet not savory. Had this had a more authentic chili sauce on it, it would have been my new favorite and it would have been incredible. I'm probably lucky it didn't because I can still fit through the door.   As for the service, location, atmosphere...those are all good, but I go to a restaurant to eat, not look around.

We have been here 3 times, take out once for dinner and sit down twice for brunch. The first thing I will warn you about is like many of our favorite places on Broadway, the star is usually one cook, and one host/wait staff. The service is as good as it can be within those limitations. Now, on to the food. Without a doubt, the dry rub wings are fantastic, crispy (no breading), bursting with flavor. None of the flavors including the Cajun are excessively hot. The Cajun has a nice mellow slow burn but not too hot.  This morning, I had the pork chop and waffles breakfast, which comes with eggs.  The pork chop was batter fried making it crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  I cut it with the butter knife, so It was tender too. I hadn't planned on getting a waffle but the chef was cooking one for another customer and the sweet smell lured me in. It came with a large dollop of whipped honey butter. The waffle and honey butter were sweet enough for me but the also brought a small container of syrup.   They also have a catfish and eggs breakfast which has very crispy catfish. This morning however, they were out of catfish, but had tilapia. Same crispy flavorful batter.   My husband also ordered 2 tacos. They were filled with roasted chicken, lettuce, onions, and cheddar cheese. The tortilla was fried fresh. The taco could rival any street taco.   So, if you have time to sit down or want to order ahead of time, I recommend giving Ewns2 a try.
