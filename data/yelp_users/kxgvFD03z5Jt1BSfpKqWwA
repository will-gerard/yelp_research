I've never come across such friendly people. The Genii that work there are amazing and very knowledgeable. You can also find help if you're willing to ask. Just don't be one of those people that just walks around waiting to be helped and you'll have a great experience.

Expect to wait for hours. They are very thorough which is awesome but you will spend all day there for just an oil change. Free wifi though. The guy at the counter also wasn't very friendly.
