This yummy Vietnamese spot never disappoints!  It's fresh and delicious.  I've been here many times with family and friends (who are Vietnamese food experts) and they love it!    My boyfriend always gets the charbroiled pork and egg rolls over noodles (#24) and there is never anything left on his plate.  I'm a bit more adventurous and try lots of different things.  The Pho is great and comes in a huge serving!    Yesterday I tried #37 (chinese sausage and shrimp fried rice).  Delicious.  The chinese sausage gave the dish a nice salty sweetness and the shrimp were big and plump.  The rice was cooked to perfection and had just the right amount of stickiness to it.  Another great dish is the salt and pepper shrimp.  The flavoring is fantastic and the shrimp are crispy and succulent.    One of the best things about this place is the pricing!!  Dishes range from $5.95 to $6.50 with seafood running a bit more.    It is a hole in the wall kinda joint.  Do not go here if you are expecting high class furnishings and impeccable service.  The staff do their job and are nice and fast.  But it's not a high-society affair.  Food comes out fast and piping hot!

My boyfriend and I went to this Arriba's location about a week ago.  We are regulars at this location because of my love of their shrimp and scallops enchiladas.  My boyfriend is not a huge fan but he humors me at times.    We get seated and he orders enchiladas with red chile.  Our food comes out and his enchiladas have green chile on them.  He looks at me to double check and make sure he had said red chile and I tell him that I heard him say red chile.  It's not a big deal and so we tell the waiter.  The waiter says he thought we had said green chile but is very nice and takes it back to the kitchen to have them change it.    As I'm starting on my meal, we hear arguing from the kitchen.  We hear someone yell in the kitchen, "I wrote down green chile but that guy out there is saying he said red chile."  After hearing this, we don't really feel comfortable staying at the restaurant.  We call over the manager and explain what happened.  He was very nice and we offered to pay our bill for our drinks and my dish but the manager told us to not worry about it and that he hoped we would return.    We just didn't feel comfortable staying and eating after hearing the arguing from the kitchen concerning our food. It made us feel unwelcome and as if they thought we were at fault for what had happened.    I come here mainly for the shrimp and scallops enchiladas, which I absolutely love.  In the past few years, I have noticed the quality of the food decline.  The shrimp/scallop enchiladas used to come out piping hot with lots of cheese and covered in a rich cream sauce.  The last few times I have been to the restaurant, the tortilla has been dry, no sauce, and it looks like they just slapped two pieces of sliced cheese on top of the enchilada.  I have been very disappointed.    All that being said;  PROS: great chips and salsa               usually great servers                managers have been very pleasant and accomodating  CONS:  decline in food quality                hostesses are not very friendly                menus always feel very oily  I think that we will probably try a different Arriba's location in the future.

Love love love Postinos!  Wonderful atmosphere, great service, and the food is fantastic!  Whenever we've had to wait (mostly on the weekends), we've been able to lounge on the grassy area (it's turf but looks and feels pretty real!).  On nice days, it's great.  People bring blankets, babies, and puppies.  Last time, my friend brought the paper and we hung out until they had a table ready for us.  They do a good job of making sure people that are waiting are taken care of as well.  Soup and sandwich combo's are great.  Fresh ingredients and love the breads.    My absolute favorite is the bruschetta.  I always get the brie/apples (YUM!), fig/mascarpone/prosciutto (can sometimes be hit or miss), Salmon/Pesto (good but sometimes the capers can be overpowering), and the fig/pistachios (again, YUM!).  I'm always satisfied and usually overstuffed.  I can handle a brushetta board by myself but it's probably good enough for two people to share.    Sometimes get the chips but they aren't anything to write home about.    Also the cucumber honey lemonade is great but the cucumber taste is strong so may not be great for everyone.  I've gotten used to it and like it but it was definitely an acquired taste.    The staff look like they could be models and are always so great and helpful.  They know their stuff and are really able to recommendations on food/drink.    Lots of parking available is also a plus!

Was very excited to go to Culvers as I've been hearing about it for a few years now.  They opened up a location near me and I figured I would try it out on my way home at lunchtime.  I ordered a mushroom swiss burger with one patty, onion rings, and a strawberry shake from the drive through.  They give you a number and have you pull up to wait for your burger to be ready.  I got my bag of food and before driving off, decided to check to make sure it was right.  Alas, no onion rings just fries.  I shut my car off and walked all the way around the building to try to find the entrance as the door nearest the drive thru is for employees only.    I go in and let them know that my order was not right.  I acknowledge that the receipt does say fries but tell them that I had ordered onion rings.  The 3 people at the counter look at me like I'm crazy and then one of them goes off to tell someone else who is in the back.  This young lady comes up to me and looks at my receipt and I again acknowledge that it says fries but tell her that I'm pretty sure I said onion rings.  She looks at me and pauses and then says, "That's fine.  It will be $1.08".  I'm slightly annoyed at this point because I'm not sure why this is taking so long.  I tell her that I do not have my wallet and that it is in the car because I just ran out of the car to get my order fixed.  She gives me a "Don't know what to tell you" look and says that it'll cost $1.08 for the onion rings because they cost more than the fries.  I'm beyond frustrated so I tell them that it's fine and I will just take these.    I get home and the burger is so-so.  The cheese was smaller than the patty and there were hardly any mushrooms on it.  The fries were bland.  The strawberry shake wasn't bad but  not as thick as I like.    So unfortunately, they lost a customer because of this frustrating customer service.  If they had a screen at the drive thru order stop OR if they even had the girl taking order REPEAT BACK the order this whole fiasco could have been avoided.    And seriously, they should have just taken back the fries and given me the onion rings.  A bad burger I could have overlooked and probably would have returned to try something else.  But annoying customer service is hard to get past.
