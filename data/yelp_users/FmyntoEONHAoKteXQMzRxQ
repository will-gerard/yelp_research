I really really don't like this place, sure it's fast, sure it's convenient, but I'd rather spend the extra dollar or two to go somewhere else (like lunch break or even Quiznos up the road). I've been here a few times, it's close to my work and I only get 30 minutes for lunch and they are always quick, but their sandwiches are the worst I've ever had. The bread is always hard to bite into (no joke, it's like biting into a piece of jerky) and it's loaded with barely any meat. There is a guy there, might be the owner, I don't know, seems like he just hates his job and his life and he's always a bit ... Off. I wouldn't say he's rude, he's just not friendly or pleasant. I'd never recommend this place to anyone I know.

Are you kidding me? How does this place even get any stars? Maybe it was just my experience, but I will not be going back, ever. We arrived at 8:30, and left at 11:30. 3 hours! And we had our dessert wrapped into a doggy bag to go. The waitress Felicia was friendly, but is a terrible waitress. It was 10:39 by the time she brought our entrees out (the place is closed at this point), and instead of giving us our food right away, she continues to talk! I've no idea how uncooked food takes so long to come out of the kitchen, and I have no idea why it takes so long for a waitress to take our orders and bring is our food so we can eat! The worst part was getting the ridiculous bill, over $200 for such an awful experience, and I'm not even full! Also, how the hell does a fondue place run out of cheese?! Explain that to me please.

Absolutely love love love this place! However the only thing I've ever gotten from here is their bean and cheese burrito, and a taco. The taco wasn't the best, but their beans are amazing. I love the service here too, they are always friendly.

I do not recommend anyone to this Starbucks. The parking lot alone is annoying to navigate through, and the drinks are always hit or miss. But let me tell you about my experience this morning. My boyfriend and I arrived a little after 9a, and there was quite a bit of people standing in line waiting for coffee (usual). I ordered an Americano with cream (my usual) and he ordered coffee with cream - both iced. When the drinks came out they tasted like the barista had dumped a good portion of cream into the drink because it tasted NOTHING like espresso or coffee. So we had them remake it with light cream. They come out looking a slight shader darker, but still with copious amount of cream, I'm irritated at this point, so we ask it be made with no cream and we will add our own. She remakes them but doesn't bother to look at both cups and gives us both coffee instead, I tell her mine is supposed to be espresso. So after her 4th attempt at my drink there's no cream thankfully, however it tastes like a cup of water with a dribble of espresso. I'm not at all a coffee snob, but if I am paying for a drink, I'd like it to taste close to what I want! So if you ever see a female barista with long straight blonde hair. I advise you to walk out, she has no idea how to make coffee, nor does she bother to read the cup.

This place never has a long wait, always has delicious food, and their snicker doodle coffee roast is very delicious, a must try! The staff and even the manager is always super friendly, upbeat and always helpful.

Came in to order curbside togo, got the soup of the day and a full size salad. The soup was broccoli cheddar, when I received the cup, it was filled a little over halfway, $3.29 for literally 1c. size of room temperature thick soup where some of the cheese is not even melted. Also another disappointment was there was ok spoon provided in our bag, just forks. Not very helpful, and sadly I have no spoons at our house since we are currently in the process of moving. And to top it off, some of the lettuce in the salad I ordered was brown. I recommend skipping this one.

Small place, cozy atmosphere, cheap prices. Tootsie roll is good. Alaska roll is good. Don't recommend getting edamame, it's $2.00 for a tiny plate of edamame that all taste different (some good, some bad, kinda like they mixed the old with the new). Miso soup tastes like it came in powdered form and they just added water.

Used to be a decent place, unfortunately it's gone down hill a lot. The one thing that I cannot understand is that they have TWO conveyer belts, but they only ever open one of them, so you're guaranteed to be waiting at least 30 min every time you come here. To me, it's not worth the wait. It's cheap sushi sure, but you get what you pay for, find another cheap sushi place for less of a wait. I don't recommend this place to anyone anymore.

Went for a hike and decided to give this place a try. I was a bit worried as I walked up to the place that it might have a dress code and we'd be turned away (as I said I was in hiking attire), but luckily they didn't. It's a different style of restaurant that I'm not used to, you seat yourself, and go up to the register to order but all your food gets served to you. We sat outside in the patio, it was beautiful (even for a hot day), the staff was very friendly. It was a bit busy, but there was not a long wait at all. And the food was absolutely delicious!! I had the daily special which was the eggs benedict with ham, and it was by far the best I've ever had-ever! My friend got the omelette which was equally as delicious. If I am ever on that side of town, I will definitely be checking this place out again. I highly recommend it!

Had the chili rellanos, was not very good, tasted like a giant cheesestick. Beans and rice were okay, beans tasted a bit watered down

The idea of the live music n such is cool (I've never experienced it at this location), but that's not what attracts me to a coffee joint, it's the coffee. I gotta say I was not at all impressed. The staff wasn't too friendly, they seemed pre-occupied with something else and their coffee (I ordered a toddy) was very bland and way over priced. Maybe they're better with their sugar filled fancy drinks, but that's not really what I drink. If you want great coffee go across the street to Talebu! (They also have mic nights, again I've not been, but I'm sure it's just as good with BETTER tasting drinks- they also have a beer/wine bar)

I love this coffe shop, always friendly service, always delicious coffee that isn't over priced (I've been to sozo coffee and gotten their toddy, it wasn't tasty and it was way over priced) highly recommend anything here!

The only reason I would go here is because of their groupon. I've been here three times now, and I probably won't be going back. I found a hair on one of the plates I pulled off the belt, and the wait or I had didn't even really acknowledge that it was something to fuss over. They are pretty expensive for what you really get. I'd say my favorite revolving sushi bar is still Teharu.

Ordered delivery tonight. Took an hour to deliver, which I guess is normal... However it was such a disappointment once I took my first bite (I was starving mind you, so normally the first bite of anything always tastes delicious) I was very disappointed. I ordered the Teriyaki chicken combo, the egg roll was very tasteless, the rice was just as bad and the teriyaki chicken was quite honestly ... Gross! I was amazed this place gets such high reviews, I've had way better Chinese at other establishments.

Good food, good beer, good service! Good location, and I like the fact that you can sit outside on the patio with your fury little friend. They have a nice selection of beers on tap, even if they are out of one you wanted, there is more to choose from. I highly recommend this place.

This place has by far the best sushi I have ever had! It opened up a while ago and I went in during the opening and it was incredibly packed, but so very much worth the wait! I have since been back a handful of times and I've never had to wait, and the service is so friendly! I really can't express enough how delicious and fresh the sashimi and rolls are. I have been to establishments that are twice the price and half the freshness of Yanagi! I recommend the chef's recommended sashimi plates and the salmon love roll. Honestly everything I've had there is delicious!
