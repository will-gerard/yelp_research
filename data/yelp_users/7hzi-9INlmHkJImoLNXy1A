I have banked with Bank of America for some 20 years but they have committed the ultimate faux-pas with their legal department. They illegally seized ALL of my and my children's' accounts - some of which contained my children's death benefits and my retirement fund deposits in them, which is against federal law. The Texas judge who fired off the order immediately reversed the order and apologized for the mistake AND also said that what Bank of America did was against federal law. So, Bank of America returned our money after about a week but Bank of America has decided to keep $100 dollars for "legal fees" and $10 from an overdraft protection fee that cleaned out a savings account when the order was issued. Even the SS agents say this act of seizing death benefits done by Bank of America was illegal in the first place "but this happens all the time with Bank of America" they said.   Oh, I talked to every manager I could at the Bank of America legal department in California until I reached AJ, who said he was at the top of the legal department. He bluntly said, "we are keeping your money".  Well Bank of America, you won your $110 for now but you lost 7 accounts already by us closing our accounts to keep you from doing further illegal things to us. I will continue to recommend that people make other banking arrangements to protect themselves from the predatory ways of the Bank of America legal department.  Sincerely, Craig Stellpflug - former Bank of America customer

The Sport Clips store in South Gilbert has absolutely littered our whole housing complex with cards - in baggies - with rocks in the baggies - as some sort of cheap advertisement campaign. The problem is that they have literally placed about 1/3 of these unsightly deposits IN THE STREET in front of the houses. Another 1/3 are on the curb of the driveway and the other 1/3 are between the curb and the sidewalk. Not only is this very cheap and ugly but it also a violation of city litter laws and also planning and development solicitation laws. The advertisement is for Sports Clips 4622 S Higley RD Gilbert AZ 480-840-6880.  This has really riled up the whole sub division and we are filing charges against the establishment and are willing to make this trashy-litter nuisance as public as possible. I called the establishment twice - morning and afternoon - but the have no owner or manager there to return my calls.
