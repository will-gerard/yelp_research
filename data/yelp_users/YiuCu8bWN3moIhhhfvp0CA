One of my favorite aspects of this Central Phoenix wine bar is that it is still somewhat "undiscovered," aka not teeming with hipsters and young professionals on a Thursday evening after work. It stays busy, but not jam packed.   Their Happy Hour is great, nice $5 small plate options, and you must try their cherry lemon drop martini. Seriously delicious. Get a ride from someone, because you'll probably want another :)   The decor is cool and they play French movies on a large screen in the back of the restaurant. I also have a special place in my heart for their awesome sweet potato fries! This place is a great option if you want a nice glass of wine and a bite to eat in Central Phoenix but don't want to brave the Postino crowds.

Rito's is as good as they say. One of my coworkers is moving in a month and we've pledged to go to Rito's at least once a week because she knows how much she'll miss it when it's gone.   Everyone loves their green chili burro but I just wanted to put a plug in for their tostadas; I always get a bean tostada and a guacamole tostada. So delicious and flavorful but you won't get that heavy, sleepy, mid-afternoon food coma that their burros tend to induce.  I echo all the negatives prior reviewers have mentioned: the staff is often rude, they only accept cash (seriously?), it's situated in a random not-so-nice neighborhood, and there's only crappy picnic table seating. But I still think the positives outweigh these significant gripes, I just recommend taking it to go and eating it back at the office! Mmm now I'm craving a guacamole tostada...

I've been to Moto several times as it's right down the street from me, and it's my go-to when I want average sushi and a Happy Hour drink. The servers are friendly and the menu is really varied; I always question establishments that serve such a stark variation in cuisine, but this place manages to competently serve everything from sushi to stir frys to burgers and sweet potato fries.   I use the term "competently" because it's by no means great food. The sushi is average, at best, but I come back because they have a good happy hour and the ambiance is way better than at your average Japanese restaurant. This place is obviously not authentic Japanese food as you quickly learn from taking a glance at their amusing menu, but I don't mind a little lack of authenticity for the sake of a more comfortable and fun environment.   My one significant gripe is that they market themselves as a sushi restaurant but the menu appears to be lacking in the most basic rolls; I usually try to order off-menu standards when I'm there like a simple tuna or yellowtail roll and they're usually accommodating. I asked for a regular salmon roll once though, and was told that they only have the smoked salmon that comes in the Philly Roll. A sushi restaurant that doesn't carry raw salmon?! You've got to be kidding me, I hope that my server was just uninformed because that's pretty inexcusable otherwise.   I wouldn't suggest coming here for sushi except during Happy Hour, because their sushi isn't very good and so it's overpriced if you go during regular times.

My favorite sushi Happy Hour in town! For only $3/roll, you can get very high quality yellowtail rolls, tuna rolls, etc. Also, their fliritinis are amazing if you're looking for a cocktail; they even come with a little shaker and extra "champagne bomb" so it's two-for-one on top of the HH price! It also goes until 6:30 which is nice (I hate those HH that only go 'til 5:30-6 - who is out of work by that time?!) and they have a reverse HH, as well.  As for the ambiance, the main dining room is average but I really enjoy sitting out on their misted/heated patio, or check out their back bar which is cool and intimate.  I'd give Zen 32 5 stars but for their spotty service. I've had awesome service here (had my birthday HH here recently and the server was so great about accommodating my party of 13, including splitting up the check for us) but I've also had really rude servers who've ignored me and had a generally bad attitude.   Also check out Gelato Spot - which is across the street - for dessert. YUM.

Cibo is hands down, my favorite gourmet sandwich place in town. You can't go wrong here...their caprese, spek and pulled pork sandwiches are among my faves (served with a nice, lightly dressed house salad or fresh fruit, yogurt and crunchy granola - skip the chips because they're just store bought in a bag), and if you are lucky enough to go on a day when they have their meatball sandwich special, don't even hesitate - it's so delicious.  Also, consider having a private party at their adorable carriage house, it's separate from the main restaurant and used for parties of 10+. I went to lunch with 10 or so coworkers and we reserved it; the service was awesome and we had the place all to ourselves!   My only small gripe with Cibo is their refusal to split checks; I just think it's really annoying when restaurants refuse to recognize the reality of modern dining that more often than not, people in a group are not going to all be paying as one. They're nice enough when you ask them to split it evenly between credit cards, though, so as I said, it's only a minor complaint.

How have I not written a review of Ticoz yet?! I've become quite a regular at this great restaurant because of their Happy Hour specials (4-6:30 daily - gotta love weekend HH's) and awesome bar food menu.   I LOVE their tacos; definitely opt for the shredded chicken over the grilled chicken, they are delicious, especially with the olive crema that they drizzle on top. Nom nom nom. Some people complain that chips & salsa aren't complimentary but an order of chips and salsa is only $1.95, comes with really fresh, delicious tortilla chips and three interesting salsas and the waiters will gladly refill both for you. I have absolutely no problem shelling out the $2 for a trio of fresh salsas and good chips, rather than getting stale chips and watered down salsa for free like in many Mexican places. Ticoz is definitely a bit more high-end, alternative Mexican cuisine, but I still think their pricing is reasonable for what you get.  The waitstaff has always been very friendly, prompt, and helpful every time I've dined there. Definitely give this place a try if you're looking for a bite to eat in Central Phoenix, especially for their Happy Hour and bar menu.

Really enjoyed Fuego Bistro for date night. The ambiance was charming and the server was friendly, knowledgeable and unobtrusive. My husband and I wanted to sample a bit of everything and had heard the entree portions were huge (literally every customer was going home with part of their dinner boxed up), so we split an appetizer, an entree and dessert. It was perfect and I left feeling satisfied but not overly stuffed.  I ordered the pomegranate mojito (virgin because I'm pregnant) and it was so refreshing, not too sweet - perfect summer drink. Can't wait to go back and try it with rum! We started with the vegetarian tostadas, which I would definitely recommend; the vegetables were really fresh on the crispy tostada and there was just enough kick from the pico de gallo and chipotle sauce.  For our entree, we shared a stuffed chicken dish with cream sauce that was the special that night (the husband loves ordering specials). Chicken was cooked perfectly and I really liked the sauce which managed to be creamy but not too rich. We chose the cornbread and creamed corn for our sides. The cornbread was yummy - light, fluffy, a little spicy - but I would past on the creamed corn next time. Too sweet and nothing special.   Finally, we split the key lime pie for dessert. We were deciding between that and the bread pudding, which sounded a bit too heavy for the 100+ degree heat outside, so we opted for the pie based on our server's recommendation. It was awesome! Smooth and slightly tangy with a crunchy chocolate crust, served with whipped cream, chocolate sauce and nuts. Definitely worth splitting an entree so you have room for dessert.  I will return to Fuego Bistro, it's a small menu but there are several dishes I would try. Our server didn't up-charge us a split plate fee for the entree which was nice, because the prices are a little steep. I also plan to check out their Happy Hour which looks like a great value...once I can finally drink again!

Oh Bomberos, I so wanted to like you and you let me down! I live just down the street from this restaurant and I'd heard it was dog friendly so I wanted to check out their patio before bringing my pups. Came in on a Friday evening for Happy Hour with a few friends and we were promptly seated on the patio. The server was very friendly and informative when it came to the various wines. I initially enjoyed the service and the wine I ordered, but then it all went downhill...  ...we ordered a few bruschetta boards and a sandwich, we just wanted some food to snack on while we enjoyed our wine. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited some more...okay you get the point. At first, I was content to have a few glasses of wine and take our time, especially because it was a Friday night and I understand that restaurants are busy on the weekend.  Finally we had to hunt down our server after we'd waited about an hour for our bruschetta to come and we asked him what was up. We were polite, of course, and he told us that the kitchen was busy and it'd be ready when it was ready. He wasn't nearly as apologetic as I thought he should've been given the wait. We ended up waiting over an HOUR AND A HALF for some melted cheese on bread. It was okay, I guess, but after that wait, it would've had to be out of this world for me to forgive the delay.   I don't think I'll be returning because the kitchen has difficulty managing to push out food, which is too bad because I really wanted to become a regular at this place; the menu looks awesome, if only they could get the food out to you in under two hours...don't waste your valuable time. There are better wine bars in town, such as Postino and Cheuvront, that offer much more efficient service.

I was very disappointed in my Sushi Roku experience! Wanted a find a hip sushi spot in Scottsdale for a bachelorette party; my first thought was Stingray but they don't take reservations and I didn't want to chance it with a party of 14, so we made a reservation at Roku.  Our party arrived in high spirits, already several bottles of champagne deep, decked out in bachelorette-party attire. No penis straws or necklaces - we stay classy - but lots beads, sashes, tiaras, etc. We had only one waiter assigned to our party of 14, which would have been fine if he had been more competent. He was slow (apparently both in server speed and intellect), boring and could not have been less friendly. We had to repeat our orders to him several times, he was awkward and strange, and didn't even comment on the fact that we were clearly celebrating a bachelorette party.  The sushi came slowly and sporadically, was "ehhh" at best, and the cocktails were AWFUL. I had to send a couple back to the bar and I was already buzzing so you know they must have been pretty bad.  The place is somewhat expensive too, so save your cash and check out other trendy sushi spots in town like Stingray, Kabuki...even RA is a better bet than this place.

I went back to Sushi Roku for another bachelorette party and it was a complete 180 from my last review. They're having a great summer Happy Hour (even on weekends!) and we decided to be decadent and order one of everything. The sushi tasted fresh, the vegetable dishes - green beans, roasted eggplant - were flavorful and well cooked, and all of the meat dishes were great too. The cocktails were much better this time around, and cheaper, thanks to Happy Hour :)   Our server was very friendly and fun, and even brought a complimentary round of champagne at the end of our meal to celebrate the bachelorette party. Sushi Roku totally won me over this time, I'm glad I gave it another shot.

Tried this Latin American spot with out-of-town guests for the first time this weekend and I definitely plan to return. The Mission would be a great place for date night; it's upscale without being pretentious, and the low-lighting, candles, and chandeliers provide a nice, sexy atmosphere.   We started with the tableside guacamole, which was incredible! Flavorful and creamy, with a great smoky heat from the chipotle. Hands down beats all the other guacamole I've had in town - including Barrio Cafe's - and I'm quite the guac snob because I make a mean version of it myself. The drinks were great too, we just had a couple rounds of house margaritas which were refreshing and on the strong side, but I'm looking forward to trying other margaritas from their extensive drink menu upon my return.   The staff was friendly, prompt, attractive, unobtrusive - pretty much everything I look for in servers. Service was a tad on the slow side, but that didn't bother me because I was enjoying the food and company and it was a Friday night after all.   I had the fish tacos which were crunchy and inventive, and also a relatively normal-sized portion. I know I'm in the minority in our indulgent society, but I appreciate it when a plate of food arrives that doesn't overwhelm/disgust me with its sheer magnitude. One of my dinner companions had a pork dish and said it was the best cooked pork he'd had in a long time so I'm sure you can't go wrong with their pork dishes, either.   I definitely recommend The Mission. It's not your traditional Mexican fare, but it's a great Latin American alternative when you're looking for something beyond your typical burrito, in a cozy, intimate environment.

Wow. Not a good place to go for a drink after work. I went for a work "Happy Hour" to Hanny's last weekend, and could not have been more put off  by the rude staff. I arrived and the group I was joining already had drinks, so I went to the bar to grab a drink.   I asked the bartender what their Happy Hour specials were and he looked at me as if I were an idiot and disdainfully said, "We don't have a Happy Hour (subtext: how terribly gauche of you to even ask), but here is our drink menu," and then shoved an overpriced wine list at me.  I was taken aback, but ordered a glass of pinot grigio, and then told him we were on the same ticket as the group right next to the bar. He said to me, "Well do you have a server?" and I replied, "I don't know, I just got here; can you please transfer this drink to that tab?" and he could not have been more rude or disgruntled about it. I'll add that there were a whopping two other people besides my group at the bar, so it's not like he was overwhelmed with other customers. With service like that, it's no wonder.  There are much better Happy Hour places you can check out after work - Fez, Switch, Cheuvront all come to mind - so skip the grouchy bartender 'tude and look elsewhere.

This has got to be one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. I can't even count the number of times that I've been here (or the original Arcadia location) and it's consistently great!   The bruschetta is flavorful and fresh (make sure to sign up for their emails, you get a coupon for free bruschetta and they don't bombard you with spam), their salads are delicious and inventive, and I always love their "soups of the moment."   The wines are a bit on the pricey side, so definitely check out their $5 glasses of wine before 5 pm. I love to go on a Saturday afternoon and get a glass (or two) of their regularly $13 sparkling Sauv. Blanc Emeri. So light and refreshing.  The service is good; it's definitely a trendy, hipster vibe but the servers are not pretentious or annoying. And their patio is dog friendly! I came in one afternoon with 3 people and 3 dogs, thinking that they would look at me like I was a crazy person and turn us away, but instead they sat us on the patio with a smile and even brought a water bowl for the pups. That's definitely the way to get a dog lover to return!   The only downside is how crowded this place is - but you can't fault it for being so awesome that everyone wants to eat there - so I try to only go at off times. If you haven't been to either Postino location yet, it's a must!

OMG THE CREAMY RICE. I can't get over how delicious it truly is; some blend of white rice, sour cream, grilled onions and magical unicorn horns or something because it is awesome! I always get the Chicken Fajita Rice Bowl and it's great every time. The chicken is always tender and perfectly cooked, the vegetables are great...and now we all know how I feel about the rice.  I've heard their fish tacos are to-die-for as well, but I've never had the opportunity to try them because I'm so loyal to my beloved rice bowl.   The ambiance is super cute too; this is just a great place for a quick bite to eat or for takeout. The counter people/runners are always very friendly and helpful...sometimes almost too helpful! We had one food runner who loitered near our table the whole meal and kept asking us if we needed anything, it got to be a bit much - but that's okay, I'd much prefer that to being neglected as customers so often are these days.  The Deluxe/Zen 32 folks have another winner!

Just came back from my second visit to The Main Ingredient, and I definitely plan to return! I'd been to this location a few times when it was Lisa G.'s, and I'm happy to report that MI is superior (I always found Lisa G.'s a little pretentious and overpriced).   Sandwiches are great - the Jive Turkey and Tuna sandwiches are delicious and very flavorful - and the service is excellent! I came in with a group of 5 co-workers on our lunch break and there weren't any tables available for our party but the waitress was really nice and apologetic and told us she would seat us soon. She took our orders in advance because we were in a bit of a hurry and seated us within a few minutes. She offered to give us separate checks and brought them shortly after our food arrived; of course, saying "no rush," but just trying to be helpful because we were pressed for time. Finally, a restaurant that doesn't act like it's the hugest hassle in the world to provide separate checks! It's a reality of modern dining and I love it when restaurants don't treat you like a pariah for requesting your own ticket. It makes things so much less awkward/complicated when you're out for a quick bite to eat with friends or coworkers.  Definitely check out the Main Ingredient next time you're looking for good food and service in a cute, cozy environment.

So glad that they opened up a Vig in my neighborhood! Huge fan.  The atmosphere is fun and cool but not trying too hard, and the servers are always friendly.  The food is consistently good.  I'm a big fan of their deconstructed fish taco salad and the vigan sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries, delicious!   It's definitely not as big as its counterpart - it has bocce ball but is missing the awesome patio - but it's also not as crowded, which is nice. I've been to both locations several times and this one seems to be more low key, even family friendly, than the original Vig which always seems to be verging on the edge of Scottsdale douchebaggery.    Their new menu is really amusing, too, give it a close read sometime.

I love Salon Embellish and have finally found a permanent hair stylist in Loris who works there. She is wonderful! The rest of the staff is always very friendly, greets you upon arrival and offers you something to drink, and the salon decor is minimalist but nice.   The complex it's in is really cute and centrally located, with a coffee shop and used book store. I highly recommend trying out the stylists at Salon Embellish - I was referred by a friend and have been going back ever since! Their pricing is very reasonable. So happy to have found Salon Embellish & Loris!

GO HERE. Seriously, just go. Stop reading this review and go eat some tacos because I don't want this place to shut down. It's surprisingly uncrowded for such a nice little Mexican spot. Granted, it's new, and I hear their other location does pretty well so maybe they just need a little while to get their following in this neighborhood. (Watch, everyone reads my glowing review and pretty soon I won't even be able to get a table).  Their margaritas are perfect, and their $1 tacos from 4-7 pm during the week can't be beat.  The staff is super friendly and the food comes out quickly.  Love their beans, so make sure to get a side of those with your happy hour tacos.  Last Friday my husband and I stopped in, got 2 margaritas, 5 tacos, chips and salsa, and a side of rice and beans for $15.  Such a steal.

Obsessed.  Stopped in for lunch for the first time last weekend and I've been thinking about it (and talking about it to anyone who will listen) all week. I'm already a regular at Postino, so I had high hopes and Windsor definitely lived up to, if not exceeded, my expectations.  The restaurant is charming from the minute you walk in...I loved the cool bar surrounded by plaid bar stools, and the nice big booths.  Make sure to take a trip to the bathroom and check out the awesome wall o' cassette tapes - it's a nice touch.  I asked my server about a few different wines and not only was he knowledgeable, but he brought me over pours of three different whites to try.  That's some pretty awesome service.  I went with his suggestion, a Riesling, which was bright and nice for the summer, and wasn't overly sweet like many Rieslings. Plus you gotta love the $5 price tag.  I also followed his suggestion for my lunch and got the halibut sandwich with the kale salad on the side.  The kale salad was light, fresh and interesting, but ohmigod the SANDWICH. I couldn't stop eating it.  Usually I wouldn't be able to finish a big ol' sandwich for lunch but I was seriously in love with this one.  The fish was delicious and flaky, the bun perfectly toasted, the vegetables a nice crisp addition, and there was some awesome creamy sauce with a bit of a kick.   I will definitely be back....there are at least five other items on their menu that I can't wait to try.  The Postino folks have another winner.  Wasn't too busy when I went there, but give it a few months to catch on and I'm sure it'll be mobbed.  Has an adorable outdoor patio that will be beautiful when the weather cools down.   I love you, Windsor!

I'm a big fan of this adorable Scottsdale spot, it's a quaint little place to take out of town guests or just to enjoy a nice weekend brunch. The ambiance is charming, the food is fresh and flavorful, and the portions are sizable so I would suggest splitting a sandwich if you're looking for a light lunch.   Came in with a large party for a bridal party brunch and the service was flawless. I'd highly recommend the warm goat cheese salad with raspberries...perfection!

So happy that DryBar opened a Central Phoenix location! Fun atmosphere, great customer service and high quality blowouts...pretty much an exact replica of the North Scottsdale location but at a much more convenient location for me.  Took my sister-in-law here for a birthday treat. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and they accommodated our request to sit next to each other as we enjoyed our blowouts and mimosas. Great idea and great brand. Will definitely be back again for a special occasion 'do.
