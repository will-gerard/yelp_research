Really nice d√©cor.  Delicious food.  Parking sucks and can only imagine what it's like during a lunch or dinner rush.  Maybe there's more parking "out back" but it's pretty sparse ... and narrow.

Let me first say, I'm just not a big fan of these chain restaurants.  We came here only b'c a friend of ours is a huge fan.  The service was decent enough.  We had a rough start regarding seating but in the end it all worked out.  We found a bug in one of our cocktails but the manager comp-ed my friend's and my drink.  That is decent enough.  I got that "small" burger they have.  Meat was a step above over cooked.  Hubby got some kind of salad and he liked it.  My fries tasted like it was fried in really old oil.  The whole experience wasn't terrible but I can't justify giving it 3 stars.    Nice location though.

Went here for Comic-Con.  Wow, lots of people.  We had a great time though and the Phoenix Convention Center was a great location.  The security was a little lax though.  That was scary.  We got into the building every day without going through security b'c we went up the elevator from the garage.  The first time we had no idea and it took us a while to figure out where registration was.  Total glitch in their security surveillance though for us to be able to get in like that!  Nonetheless, we had a great time.  It was nice and cool in the building which is always a plus in Phoenix!

I do not frequent stadium venues but compared to the ones I have been to, this one is pretty nice!!  Pretty much anywhere in the house you can get pretty decent seats.  I would pick seats that are located in front of the entry way to the seats and not behind it and would also avoid the nosebleeds.  Other than that, anywhere should be decent.

I've only been to one other Sweet Tomatoes and this one is above par to the usual one we go to.  I like their layout and tables, the food is delicious as usual and they  just seem to be run better.  If we are in the area, I'd definitely come here again.  YUM!

Our experience from start to finish lasted over 2 hours.  Needless to say, after an hour of waiting, I told my husband, "This place better be damn good."  And it was.  It must have been prom night, hence the long wait; however, seeing how they had so many benches for people to sit at while they waited to be called, they are probably busy every night.  The hostess even came up to us to see if we wanted anything to drink.  We weren't even charged for our iced tea.  After an hour of waiting, we finally got seated and our server was nice, informative, and tended to our needs in a pretty timely fashion.  He didn't even mind that our 14 month old daughter kept tugging at his belt.    We ordered the honey mustard wings and sweet potato fries as starters and they were delicious.  The chicken wings were a little on the "too fried" side but I think that's relative to your own palette.  The flavor was awesome.  The sweet potato fries was delectable.  Definitely tasted like they were using "fresh oil" to fry the fries instead of "old oil".  That's always a good thing.  We ordered a 10" Chicago style deep dish with sausage and pepperoni.  O.M.G.  That's all I can say about it!!  It was awesome!!  I could only eat one piece, however, b'c I was so full!  Our dishes definitely came out slow but our waiter did inform us of this beforehand so we weren't disappointed about it.  Besides, you can rush good pizza, right?!  I don't know how busy they are any other time of the day but we got there around 4:30pm on a Friday and waited an hour to get seated.  I definitely recommend coming here to try out their food but if wait is a concern, make sure you call ahead to see if they are busy!  I want to emphasize the really great service.  We were asked how our meal went, our waiter was really nice, and we were given a warm good-bye, too!!  Thanks for a great experience Oregano's!

We were staying at the hotel and decided to make reservations here for dinner.  We wanted to come here a couple of years back but didn't get a chance to due to scheduling so we were pretty excited about finally being able to come here for dinner!  If you're staying at the hotel by the way, no, you can't walk it, especially if you are in heels.  Don't even try.  It's not worth it.  The hotel has a service where they will drive you up there ... I'm pretty sure it's complimentary but check with the hotel.  So we get in and nobody to greet us.  I was disappointed and a little confused b'c for a minute there, we had no idea what was going on.  When the hostess finally showed up, however, we were welcomed and seated promptly.    Our waiter (Bob I think was his name) was exceptional.  He told us about the evening special and was very attentive throughout the entire evening.  My husband and I aren't really fancy people so coming to places like this kind of intimidate us but he was very personable and I'm pretty sure he knew we didn't "fit in" with the crowd there.  The view is awesome.  WOW.  We really enjoyed having a view of the city in front of us as we dined.  I had the lobster and the husband had the duck.  Both of our meals were delectable.  We also shared a side dish of risotto which was also very savory and delicious.  The lobster tasted fresh and succulent.   I was very surprised considering we live in Phoenix!  No dousing of the lobster in butter to make it tasteful - it was perfect just the way it was (as it should be!).    We also shared a dessert ... I can't remember the name but it was chocolate peanut butter something-a-ruther with Snicker's ice cream I think?  Anyway, that was good, too.    This place definitely ain't cheap but for the experience, it was well worth coming here.  We'd definitely come here again in the future if the occasion arises!

Wow!  This is a great restaurant for sushi.  The staff was nice and the food was great.  There's a pretty lively atmosphere.  It's a bit on the pricey side but then again, it is sushi.  I definitely recommend going with a group or date ... you will have a blast!

I've never had a problem with my Mac until recently so I decided to make a Genius appointment.  Turned out I was using 496 gb of my 500 gb hard drive space with most of the allocation going to iphoto library.  They helped me get enough space back to be able to start my laptop back up.  Very grateful and even happier the service was complimentary.

When we bought your furniture 3 years ago, I wasn't an avid Yelper yet.  Now that I am, and I recently had a lovely experience here, I thought I should give you guys some kudos.  We came into your store today looking for a replacement knob for my toddler's drawer.  It accidentally came off during transit.  The sales associate - who seemed like she had a very long day - was cordial and went looking for one.  A few minutes later it seemed like there was no luck but she ended up finding one.  I didn't have to get an entire set replacement - yay!    Seemed like she went above and beyond what she needed to do and I am very thankful.  She could've easily said no and brushed us off but instead helped us out.  Thank you Pottery Barn Kids!  You have a customer for life!  ... Well, until my kiddo grows up.

What a neat little place to visit!!    If your kids like trains this is a great place to spend the day.  Well, half a day.  There's not that much to do but enough to keep my two year old entertained for a few hours.  I wish they had a better gift shop but other than that, we enjoyed our first visit.  Will definitely come visit again!

We celebrated our 6 year wedding anniversary last night at the Meling Pot and had a wonderful experience.  It was our first time going and they really did a great job personalizing the experience.  We had a card and flowers waiting for us at our table and the wait staff all congratulated us on our celebration.  That doesn't mean much if the food isn't good but it was deeee-lish!  We had the Big Night Out and was able to customize the menu to our liking.  Although the main entree wasn't much more than a glorified hot pot at a Chinese restuarant, it was still awesome.  You can't go wrong with dipping your appetizer in melted cheese and your desserts in chocolate.  We would definitely go there again!

The good:  Awesome pool, nice staff, air conditioned rooms with comfy beds, overall nice facility in general.  The bad: older hotel, smaller rooms, NO TUB (unless you get a wheel chair accessible room).  We had an overall great stay here.  This was our staycation for our 10 year wedding anniversary and the staff was even nice enough to send us chocolate lava cake with milk.  It was definitely a nice touch.  We'd definitely come visit again.

My chief complaint is THE LINE!  Every time we come by here there's never much of a line but when we finally show up one day to actually build a bear, there was a party going on, it was a holiday and everybody and their kid just HAD to get a bear that day.  Goodness!  I think if there's a party going on, it would be beneficial to have a separate stuffing machine for the party kids.  We waited at least 40 minutes to get our pony stuffed.  The process is fun though.  I loved watching my daughter pick stuff out.  It definitely all adds up so maybe come prepared.  It might be a good idea to know beforehand what accessories you want to get for your stuffie b'c once you're in that zone of getting stuff, it's hard to tell your kid no.  Well, it as for me.    Definitely worth doing at least once.  Our My Little Pony cost us $80+ so it doesn't come cheap so preparation may help keep your costs down!

I came here thinking it was a butcher shop.  It's not.  They had a tiny display area but no butcher there.  It's more like a small grocery store from the 70s.  It has everything you need though so if you're looking to buy staples in the area, they should carry it.  Don't come here thinking you're going to get a butcher shop.  Definitely more farmer than butcher!

Great food great service!  We will definitely be taking family here when they come visit.  The place is kind of small though but it's a nice intimate setting.  I got the baby clams in linguini - lots and lots of garlic which I like but they did have some pretty big chunks in there which I didn't care for too much but my dish definitely tasted yummy.  The hubby had their special of the day which was a pork chop with sweet potato and asparagus.  I had a bite and was jealous of his yummy meal!

My husband and I have been coming here for several years and have enjoyed our experience.  Dr. Wilson is awesome and really takes the time to talk about your eye health, even when they are pretty healthy.   I wouldn't say the staff is rude but it is a pretty busy office so they can't always get to you timely.  I think it's a good thing to go to a doctor's office with patients!    The eyewear selection isn't great but I've always been able to find pairs that I love.  It takes time to search.  It would be nice to see more out there but then too many choices can be a challenge, too.  I do think the prices are more expensive but if I wanted to go to a discount place, I can always take the prescription somewhere else.  I think their prices are comprable to other non-discount places.  Still, it would be nice to see sales!  The awesome thing about the place is you don't have to get the eye drop test thingy.  They've got this digital machine.  It cost extra (which totally sucks ... if I remember correctly, it's around $30) but worth it.

Ice cream - made to order.  Need I say more?  Seriously though, the couple times I've been here the folks behind the counter are nice.  The ice cream is of course yummy.  Hub's comic book store is in the same shopping center so it's always hard to say no!

Yay, they're back!!  All the stuff that used to be there is pretty much still there.  The soup/dessert area seems to be a little smaller and that beverage station they used to have is no longer there but the food is still yummy and yes, they still have their soft serve!  I'm not fond of the aluminum trays they've got now and their salad plates seem t be slightly smaller but everything else seems to be back the way it used to be.  Yay!

I like how the Starbuck's here is I the center of the bookstore.  Nice place to people watch!  Ahh, but that was in my more formative years, before having a kid.  Now, we go there mainly to look at the kid's section and I think they have a good variety.  Definitely like spending an afternoon here chillin' with the kiddo and picking out books!

I love this place!  We've never been to Greece or have had "authentic" Greek food at a fancy restuarant but I have had falafal and gyros and New York City so I'm basing my comparison on that and I think this place is pretty awesome.  We used to love going to Ararat's Mediterranean (sp?) and now that it has closed, Greek Wraps is our new fave.  It's a ways drive for us since we live way out in Buckeye but anytime we are out that direction, we almost always head to Greek Wraps.    We've had their falafel and gyro platters/wraps and enjoy them a lot.  I think the falafael is a little on the crunchy side but I don't know if it's more authentic for it to be "software" or crunchy like they make it.  Their rice is good, too.  My husband even picked up catering for his work crew and they all enjoyed it a lot, too.  The service is pretty decent, too.  Nothing fancy but they greet you and help you out of you ever have any questions.

We attended a birthday party here and it was a lot of fun!!  The kids loved it!  Our daughter is only 14 months so she was engaged for about 15 minutes of it and then lost interest.  My only advice is you probably don't want to bring a child that can't sit down for the whole show.  They have rules like "no eating/drinking", "no walking around in front of the stage","no crying/talking" so if your little one is rambunctious or difficult and you have multiple kids, you will have to tag team it and leave the theatre with the one that isn't cooperating!!  You can always come back though.  The show itself was simple but fun.  I loved the puppets.  You're not going to get any grand sets or special effects but if you bring a good imagination, you won't be disappointed!

We almost always fly SWA.  Their ticket prices was the most competitive when I had to buy last minute tickets to visit my father who was dying from cancer.  Still cost and arm and a leg but still half the price of what the other airlines were charging.  That was 10 years ago so I'm not sure how competitive they are now.  I also like that you can cancel a flight and rebook it without any penalties.  Thank you SWA for not price gouging.

CON: (1) Small but your little one can probably spend a couple of hours here (2) No place to have lunch but there is a vending machine area.  PRO: Our 17 mo old LOVED it.  Great place to roam and set her free.  We still followed her around though.  The play area to the right is specifically meant for 4 (or 5?) and younger but there were definitely older kids there.  I guess it wasn't too big of a deal b'c the place wasn't packed but I can imagine what a zoo it would be when it is busy.  THese places always make me feel icky 'cuz all I think of is how germ-y everything is but they do have hand sanitizers.  Not enough but they were around.  Wish we had something like this in the far west valley ... definitely something to take the little one to so she can exert some energy!

We always have fun coming here.  Be forewarned though, lots of non-Renaissance stuff going on here, too, like people dressing up as animals and other weird stuff.  All the shows you go to are free but they do ask for tips.  A heck of a lot of vendors ... I'd bring cash and make that the limit to your spending for the day because it is easy to get carried away.  Get there early because they do a little show just beforehand with the queen coming through.  Food is mediocre but edible...vanilla shake is more icy than milky but I guess whether good or not is up to the taster.  Do mermaids belong in the Renaissance era?  Does it doesn't, she's there.  Parking is free...everything is dirt or gravel so pushing a wheelchair or stroller is kind of a pain but it's not too bad.  Bring sunscreen.  HAVE FUN!

Great service, food was awesome and they had a Mother's Day special that made it all a great deal!  I say "great deal" but this place is uber-expensive.  $50/person, easy and no alcoholic beverages.  Definitely a nice treat but not a "I come here all the time" type place.

Compared to other seafood places, this place is good but friggin' expensive.  Compared to other seafood places in Phoenix, it's friggin' awesome but still friggin' expensive.  It has been a couple of years since we've been there so I can't say how the place is now but the seafood tasted fresh and the service was good (though not great).  With tax and tip, we spent a good $150 there and I think only ordered one drink.  The restuarant itself is kind of neat.  You go there and all you see is a parking lot with a door and three walls.  The restaurant is actually underground.  I think it's worth going for special occassions, especially since it's so hard to find good seafood places in the valley, IMO.

We usually go to a different Oregano's (somewhere in the middle of Phoenix  on Camelback or or something?) and this is is similar - good food good service!!  The only complaint is parking.  Do all Oregano's parking suck or what?  Small lot, crammed spaces.  I guess that is the beauty of it all.  Let's jam everybody together like one big happy family!  If you like Oregnao's this place won't disappoint.  If it's your first time they make great meatball sandwiches, salads, deep dish pizza (and others) and of course pasta!!  Come with an appetite!

This is our third year coming here for their Fall Pumpkin Festival - every year since my daughter's been born.  It's a great family tradition for us.  Plenty of things to do for about half the day.  Kids will love it.  If you can, try to come when it's a little cooler.  My only complaint is that this place is growing like crazy!  Seems like it gets more and more crowded every year but I guess that's good for business!

We came here for the Hello Kitty Friendship Festival.  The Festival itself kind of sucked but the Arena is quite nice.  I think it's mainly for hockey.  It's definitely a smaller venue but located conveniently to restaurants and all the Westgate fun.  Minus one point because the restroom had a super fowl odor.  I'm going to chalk that one up to a specific issue that happened that day but other than that, it's a nice stadium.

Ice cream is good but service is terrible!!  Well, not terrible but REALLY SLOW.  We must have gotten there during a movie rush or something but there were about 10 people ahead of us.  Wait time is expected but I'm pretty sure we wait for like 30 minutes.  They had 3 employees there who could've been helping with customers.  Instead, one employee was making waffle cups ... and there were at least 50 waffle cups sitting around waiting to get gobbled up.  Maybe she was a newbie but nonetheless, pretty annoying.  The tables were super sticky, too.  More so than most ice cream places I've ben to.  Really big disappointment.  Only come here when there are not many customers around 'cuz you'll be waiting a while.

For Phoenix, it's not too bad.  The dining area is small compared to other dimsum places I've been to (across the country).  The service is as expected as most are immigrants - but surprisingly, better than other places I've been to.  The dimsum like I said is OK.  It's on a cart so that's cool and I didn't feel like stuff was "reheated" but the whole dynamic of how it all ran and being able to get the dish you wanted and when you wanted just didn't flow very well - probably due to the small dining area.  We waited a lot for our food - which is bad for them b'c the longer you wait, quicker you get full so for 2 adults and 1 toddler, we usually spend around $40.  Today, $30.  I live pretty far and just happen to be in the area.  I don't think I'd come here specifically just for dimsum but if I were in the area, I might go try it again.  I know my tone sounds like I should give this place 3 stars at most but I'm trying to compare it to other dimsum places in the area.  If I do that, then it's 4 stars.

We stumbled upon this festival but accident but had a delightful time.  Nice entertainment, friendly vendors and even though the weather was quite windy that day, we still enjoyed the company of bonsai trees and people dressed in costume.  Why are people dressed in costume?  I have no idea ... just b'c anime is Japanese doesn't mean you should dress in anime costume to a Japanese festival but it's all good.  I like to people watch.

Great atmosphere, great food, and great service!  My first time there the chef made our pizza wrong.  Despite that, the pizza was still pretty awesome and the waitress was even kind enough to give us the right version.  We ended up getting three pizzas for the price of two.  That was over and beyond my expectation.  Needless to say, we gave the waitress a generous gratuity and everybody left happy.  I have been there a few other times and and everytime has been a wonderful experience.  My only qualm is that there's not enough parking.  You need to get there super early or super late and even then parking can still be a challenge.  LOVE THE FOOD there and that's the most important thing!

I've only  had German food twice in my life and Haus Murphy's was my second time.  With that said, I really liked the place!  We had the potato pancake and my 1/8 German daughter went to town with it!  We also had the schnitzel I think is what it's called (the breaded meat) and that was AWESOME.  I can't remember the name of the sausage but that was good, too.  The beef portion of the dish was meh.  Kind of dry but maybe that's how it's supposed to be.  LIke I said, I don't know much about German food!  The service was OK.  We had to ask for a high chair like 3 times but they were nice about it.  When our FIL comes to town we will take him here to give it a try.  It's definitely worth going to check out.  Hope you enjoy!

So they sell a lot of Jewish-type foods.  I don't know much about Jewish foods so I can't offer much of a comparison but what we did order was delicious.  Mine was two eggs on top of some kind of salty meat and potato latke with Russian dressing drizzled on top.  I didn't think I'd like it b'c the Russian dressing tasted like Thousand Island but was hot.  I warmed up to it!  Nice casual atmosphere.

I'm glad they reopened.  Good service, good food.  We're not really sports bar people but come here b'c the wings are dee-lish.  There's plenty of tables and booths and TVs though.

I'm not really an outdoors person but this place is pretty darn huge.  Really big gun selection.  I usually come here and wait for my husband to peruse.  All the camo apparel they sell keeps me entertained.

We came here to take a break from our photo session.  Ordered several beverages and each one was awesome.  Great customer service.  Nice little quaint caf√©.  Would definitely come again when we are in the area.  I personally had the Thai Tea and it was awesome.  Not super sweet like other places.  It was PERFECT!

We stayed in the king suite for our one night getaway as the grandparents watched the kiddo.  What a nice treat it was!  Beware the hotel is very steep in areas.  It is built on a mountain after all.    Service was good.  Hotel room was huge but definitely needs updating.  The wallpaper in the bathroom was falling off and considering how expensive ($300/nt!) it was, I was expecting a nicer tub/shower.  It's like the typical showers you see in motels.  Not impressive at all.  Other than that though, we really enjoyed our stay here.  We came off-peak so a lot of their amenities were not available to us but that wasn't a big deal for us.  It was a nice way to reboot for the hubby and I.

WOW, their chocolate cupcake is sinful.  Very rich icing which I believe as ganache - or at least had that consistency.  Very delicious.  I also had their pineapple coconut cookie which was very good as well.  There's a couple of bar seats in the store and a couple of tables in front of the store and that's about it.  Definitely more of a take-it-and-go establishment.

I can't believe this place shut down.  It was our favorite Greek restuarant.  Ugh, I am so bummed!  The staff was friendly, the food was AWESOME and we were never disappointed.  We'd been going there for a few years and then one day, poof!  Come back Ararat's!

We love coming here!!  The food is a little on the pricey side for what you get but you never leave there feeling like you "over did it".  It's pretty much like a soup and sandwich place but during dinner they serve more hot meals.  If you've ever had Panera Bread, I would compare it to that.  I love the fresh ingredients that they use and the breads they make daily.  They've also got a pastry lay out and they are too die for (ESPECIALLY the cheese danish ... YUM!)  My favorite lunch item is the almond tuna sandwich with butternut squash soup (a Pick Two meal).  Service is decent and they are almost always busy.  It's in a relatively large shopping center so parking isn't a problem unless you go at peak ... but you'll just be parking a little further.  ENJOY!

If you get here during rush hour, it can get pretty slow. However, breakfast is par with other decent McD's and the bathroom and general cleanliness is slightly above par. Good place to take a break. No playground though.

First time going to lunch ... went with a girlfriend and we both had our babies.  Thankfully the place wasn't busy or else her stroller and my wily kid would have caused a mess!  Tried their pizza this time ... thin crust Americana and it was delicious!!  Never had their pizza before so I was eager to check it out.  Definitely want to come here again!

We are reviewing the maternity ward.  This was our first child and first hospital stay so we don't have anything to compare it to but thought our first time experience was excellent.  The staff was great.  I loved the nurses there.  They did a great job making sure we were comfortable and had what we needed.  The rooms were clean and the staff was great, including the waitstaff and cleaning crew.  I would definitely recommend Banner Estrella for your next baby!

We've been frequenting here for five years now and their food is always consistent.  Service is great.  My only complaint - well, there's 2 - is they are SUPER busy during lunch hours and the parking isn't so great.  If you go off peak, no problem.  As far as Chipotles go, this one definitely passes muster!

The baristas were nice enough but the service was incredibly slow.  There was no line when I came in but apparently there were at least 2 or 3 orders ahead of me ... and they didn't start serving the first one ahead of me until 2 minutes of waiting.  I got the chocolate chip blended drink and it was really icy ... I've had the drink before and it's usually creamier.  Very disappointing.

My husband should probably be the one writing this review but I've definitely been there with him enough times to comment on their customer service ... which is great.  You can order subscriptions there to your favorite magazines which basically means once the comic comes out, they'll put a copy aside for you.  The place isn't huge but the hubby's never complained about not getting what he wants.  It's entertaining to go their when there's some sort of Magic or whatever other role-playing "gatherings" are going on that day.    We've been going to them for  a few years now and we definitely recommend them!

We come here for our dental needs and love it!!  It's pretty modern, TV in every room and the service is great.  Dr. Sam is awesome and so are the assistants and hygienists!  I'm being vague here because I've had very little sleep and it's late.  Forgive me!!  My recent experience I had to get a crown and it was cool that it gets done in the office.  I could even watch the machine that was sawing away to make it fit in my mouth!  Sawing is inaccurate.  The machine used pressurized water.  How cool is that?!

What a neat area!  So I'm reviewing this location from a different perspective ... our photographer suggested this place for our family photos.  We paid for tickets and a nominal fee.  Lots of wonderful spots/textures for background setting.  It was really awesome.  There was a house kitty there, too, that my daughter loved (she's really into cats right now.  We had a lovely time here with very nice people working there.  We will definitely want to come back again!

It has been a while since I've been here.  You know the place is good when you haven't gone in a couple of years and they've expanded!!  This place is just as good now as it was before.  We enjoyed the shredded beef with rice and the noodle dish (that is soup-less).  Boba was nice and fresh.  I hate it when the pearls are not fresh!  Definitely check this place out!  Really great food!

Expensive foo-foo cupcakes but worth every penny and calorie!!  Service is great here ... took some on the plane and when I explained this to the ladies, the wrapped each cupcake individually before placing htem in the box.  Then they sealed the box up for me so it it will stay fresh longer.  I'm glad this place is clear across town for us or else we'd be coming here more than we should!

Field trip day with my daughter's preschool class brought us here.  What a delight.  We watched the Goodnight Moon play.  The set was exactly like the green room in the book.  I was amazed a whole bunch of 3-5 year olds sat through the play mesmerized.  Had a great time.

The State Fair is definitely subpar compared to the Texas State Fair.  Also, it doesn't seem like it's in the greatest part of the neighborhood so we never come here at night.  Our trips always during the day and we leave before it gets dark.  The rides seem like they aren't going to hold up well and I've seen exposed wires which should've been taped down or something.  Plus, it was raining.  It was hard telling my kid no when she saw the rides still going on but I had to make a command decision!

I'm not usually big on chain restaurants but Pappadeaux's has consistently been good at every location I've been to.  I almost always get the Crawfish Etoufee.  I'm so addicted to that stuff.  I took my husband here for his birthday on our most recent visit and mentioned it was his birthday.  Hubs got to pick out any dessert he wanted, complimentary!  I know a lot of places do this but it was also a full size dessert.  Awesome!

We take our daughter here and love love the staff.  We usually see the PA Eryn (sp?) and she is great with our kiddo.  The MAs are also great there.  I can call and ask a question about something regarding our daughter and get a prompt response if not then and there when i call.  As a first time parent, that is quite a blessing!  So it is a little strange that old people and younglings go to the same office but if you can get past that, it's totally worth going, especially if you live in the area.  The staff is great and so is our daughter's board certified pediatrician, Dr. Johnson.  They are not particularly pushy about one opinion or another which I feel like is a good thing.

Based on everybody's reviews, I HAD to try this place out.  I mean really HAD to.  I'm Chinese so I KNOW Chinese food and there's not a whole lot of places to go that's decent on our side of town.  So it's still a good 15-20 miles away from us but we were in the neighborhood so we decided to give it a try.  WOW!  Granted, not the best Chinese food I ever had but definitely the best I've had in the West Valley.  I would say if it were in any other place like NY, LA, Houston, I would have given it 3 stars but for Phoenix, definitely 4.  The service was also very good, which you don't usually see in Chinese restaurants.  I ain't hatin' either - it's just the way it is.  :)  We  had the Beef Chow Fun, Honey Walnut Shrimp, and Crispy Orange Beef.  The COB wasn't very spicy which was fine by us, but had a nice sweet tangy flavor to it.  It didn't taste like it had much of a layer on it - almost like they  just fried the beef - but it tasted pretty good.  Never eaten it that way before.The HWS had huge shrimp but not a whole lot of it.  Which was fine.  I thought the mayo sort of overpowered the whole dish but it was still better than any other place I've had in the Valley.  Finally, the BCF was the best dish.  I'm a fan of big noodles and they did a good job with the flavoring.  We really enjoyed our meal here and will definitely come again.  All the flavoring in their food was pretty good, if not awesome.  Not super salty like Pei Wei can be (my I-don't-have-any-other-choice-but-to-come-here option) but rather just the right touch.    When we got there, pretty much all their tables were full and the conversations I heard several of the patrons had with the waiters/waitress was, "Thanks for coming again, see you next week/time."  DEFINITELY a good sign.  We weren't disappointed!

As far as Jason's Deli goes, it's pretty decent.  I would say compared to other deli-style restaurants, it's 3 stars.  You can enjoy their salad buffet, order a (huge) spud or they have a variety of sandwiches.  Nice place to get something simple and yummy.

We come here pretty regularly and think that the sushi is pretty good.  Best in the west valley that we've had so far.  The staff is nice but not great as our drinks are not always filled but we're greeted every time we come in.  They've got a pretty good variety of sushi rolls and sashimi.  The hot foods are decent, too.  I've seen large groups there before and the ambiance is perfect for either a date or a group.

It was prom day but the staff was still able to squeeze in a walk-in like me.  I wasn't expecting an appointment that day for highlights but one of the girls was finishing up her last client.  What's important is that I loved my highlights.  She did a great job at asking me my "hair history" and wasn't pushy about selling products (although she did mention the products).  The salon seemed pretty well managed and I enjoyed the hip atmosphere.  I would definitely go there again.

This place was pretty good!  The broth in my pho wasn't as tasty as I normally like it but it was still good.  My daughter loved the pho noodles (the only thing she eats).  Service was pretty decent and I liked that they had tofu spring rolls even though the peanut sauce was just OK.  We would definitely come back here again.

Wow, what fun!!  We took our 15 mo old and she LOVED it.  We spent the most time on the third floor where most of the youngling activities took place.  There's a grocery shopping area where they can pretend buy groceries.  We had a lot of fun with that!  They had some pretty international food items which I thought was cute.  It's definitely a place for kids of all ages.  Not so much a museum as it is a huge indoor play park.  That's my opinion anyway.    The only reason I'm rating this 4 stars is the lack of food.  There is pre-made stand that sells sandwiches, fruit, salad and kid friendly items but no restaurant.  Just a heads up for you parents who don't like to cook or bring brown bags (i.e. me).  It's not that great so in the future, I would cut the trip short or have a lunch packed.  Definitely 5 stars for fun.

We came here for lunch.  They open at noon, not 11am, just FYI!  There were people waiting outside so when they opened, there was sort of a rush for the waiters to get everybody seated and drink orders established.  Here's what we ordered:  Fritto Misto - Calamari, delish; julienne carrots, scrumptious; ginger, meh but it wasn't them - I'm just not a big fan of ginger.  Tempura style fried.  Tasted like tempura and not over-fried food.  Yay  Vogue Burger - YUM ... I don't usually have fancy gourmet burgers.  In fact, this is probably the fanciest gourmet burger I've ever had and it was quite good.  There was something sweet in there - maybe the chutney - and the bun was sooo good.  A whole lot of different flavors but nothing overpowering.  Nice blend.  Chicken Panini - the husband had this and he enjoyed it.  I took a bite of his and thought it was pretty good.    Sweet tomato fries - YUM.  I thought the flavoring on it is one of the better ones I've had compared to other places  Vogue Mac N Cheese - Got this for our 14 mo old.  It's "fancy mac n cheese" so needless to say, she wasn't too thrilled with it.  I liked it ... kind of had a strong cheese flavor to it but not the traditional cheddar cheese you normally put in there.  The service was good.  The general atmosphere was also nice.  Definitely a good place to try!

The check-in/out folks were awesome.  Very personable and very nice.  Five stars of that experience.  We had one of the king suites on the 34th floor.  It was nice and there is nothing much to complain about except in our room, there was some gooey sticky stuff on the door.  I should've told them about it but I didn't so it's my own fault but it wasn't bothering me at all.  I just think they should have some sort of check system for that.  The suite is smaller than in the Venetian but it's about par as far as amenities and comfortability goes.  I liked the ambience of the hotel, too.

Our experience was totally different. If I rated on just the food, I would give it 3 stars; however, the service was terrible.  We come in, the waitress points to where we need to sit and she brings a high chair for us.  She asks us what we want to drink; we said water and from then on she just acted like a total B.  And I use this word quite sparingly so believe me when I was not happy at all with her attitude.  We have a kid, we know it's going to get messy so we are usually very kind to the wait staff so I know it wasn't us.  We order 3 lunch specials and all three should come with soup.  We only get two.  I asked about the third and she just seemed totally unhappy I even mentioned it.  I don't get it, especially since all the other reviews have been decent about their service.  Never got a refill on my water.  I think the hubby did once.  Never asked how we were doing.  They weren't even busy.  Towards the end she seemed nicer but the first impression was already made.  Maybe she just finished with a crappy customer or something.  I'll give them a second shot.  They are reasonably priced.  We haven't had a lunch under $20 (before tip)

I didn't buy anything here but I thought the staff was very friendly and not pushy at all.  He introduced himself and asked if I wanted a tour of the store which I declined but he still came by to check up on me after that.  He wasn't ever salesman-y.  I think it's a combination of stores which others have mentioned.  If you already have little ones, there's also a little play area in the center of the room.  Nice touch.

WOW, talk about an awesome steak.  We had reservations and were seated within minutes.  Nice d√©cor, not really a place I'd take my toddler to but it was date night after all and the kiddo was at home - yippee!    But I digress.  I don't know much about wine but it looked like a pretty large selection and you can go through them either on the menu or on the iPad.  Way cool.    We both got rib eye - the hubby with bone mine without - his rare, mine medium well and he said that his was perfection. Mine was, too.    It didn't come with any sides so we shared a side of mashed potatoes.  The only thing I'd dock them a few points for is the food is really expensive.  I guess I can understand why my rib eye was almost $50 but $10 for a side of mashed potatoes?  Eeesh.  You can't go wrong getting a badass piece of juicy mouth watering steak here but I don't think I would come here for a while.  A $165 meal is probably something we do once every several years.  See you again in a few more years Flemings.  It was nice meeting you!  (It was our first time coming here)

I'm trying to get the Sushi Sensei badge so lately we've been going to different sushi places around town.  So far, I've been sorely disappointed and actually feel bad for "cheating" on our go-to favorite Japanese restaurant on the (far) west side - Tomo's.  I don't know exactly what the criteria is to get the Sushi Sensei badge but I'm just about ready to give up, at least going to new places around here.  Seriously, it has been a huge disappointment.  Okay, this place ... don't bother with getting the curry.  You know those curry packages you get at the store to make your own curry?  Yup, tastes like that.  It's fine and all but charging me $9 and putting on the plate 2 potatoes and 2 carrots, not cool.  The ramen had no taste - literally.  No wonder my toddler didn't like it and she LOVES noodles.  The sushi was ok.  We had the Philadelphia, Rainbow, and Tempura shrimp.  Nothing great but better than our last experience at A Hai.  Our friends got the egg roll and it looked like 1 egg roll cut up into a whole bunch of pieces and cost $4.  Maybe it was 2 egg rolls but it sure didn't look it.  I guess it's not totally unheard of to charge $4 for 2 egg rolls but I was not impressed.  Our total came out to $42 before tip (no alcohol) and it just totally seemed not worth it.  I'd rather pay a few extra bucks and stick with Tomo's.

The cookies and breakfast pastries are to die for.  Just for those two items they deserve four stars.  Everything else, however, is just OK.  The rest of their foods are good but not great.  If you've ever been to Wildflower, I think their food is better there but dang, I can go to Paradise and just pig-out on their cookies!

Enjoyed our first time there.  We tried the turkey/cheese croissant; ham/cheese croissant; and chocolate chip scone.  They were all delicious!  The stuffed croissants were a little on the salty side but that was probably just my taste buds 'cuz hubby loved them.  The scone tasted kinda cake-y and not very crumbly/dry, which is what I thought scones should taste like but I'm not an expert on scones either.  Hubby liked the hot chocolate and I thought they creme brulee coffee was good, too.  The owner was really nice.  I'm looking forward to going back again and trying the boba flavors.  Now boba, I AM an expert of so I hope it's good!

First time being on a dairy farm so I don't really have anything to compare it to but we went there for a birthday party this past weekend and it was a lot of fun!  The folks there were really friendly and I think the kids had a blast.  There were animals to pet and we all got to go on a hayride around the farm and checked out the cows.  Learned that cows have to be pregnant in order to produce milk.  *duh*

This place probably doesn't compare to the "real deal" in Taiwan but I took my Mom here (who grew up in Taiwan) and we both really liked it.  We got the egg plant/tofu dish and that fatty meat with bamboo dish and we thought they were both pretty authentic.  For their "small appetizers" we tried the scallion pancakes which was OK.  The place is pretty small and we went the week of CNY so of course it was super crowded.  I don't know how busy they are during "regular" days.  We really enjoyed the service and the food.  Would definitely go there again and try different stuff on the menu.  Prices were very reasonable, too.

I love fish tacos and although I do enjoy coming here, I don't think their fish is that fresh.  Well, let me rephrase, I don't think the oil they fry their fish in is that fresh.  It went past the due date of how often oil should be changed out when frying food.  Don't skimp out on this step Rubio's!  Other than that, the service was good, the salsa was good and the experience as a whole wasn't too bad.  They just really need to work on changing out their oil more frequently.

Note to self: fancy place, not the greatest restaurant to take your 14 mo old on a whim and  you and your hubby are wearing casual wear.  With that said, even though we looked out of place, we still had a great time and the service was excellent!  We never get our money's worth in these type of churrasco restaurants because neither my husband nor I can pack it in.  However, the meats were delicious and their appetizer/salad spread was yummy, too!!  I love hearts of palm and mushrooms so this was right up my alley but they also had "normal" stuff too like potato salads and regular salads and the like.  Great place for a date, especially if you want to impress.  You can go in there in casual wear, too, as we did, but it is more of an upscale type establishment.  Enjoy!

The only thing keeping me from giving the place five stars is the price.  It's a hole-in-the-wall little restuarant and the food is awesome but pricey for the quantity and type of food you get.  For example, a cup (not bowl) of chicken gumbo is $6.50 and red beans and rice is $6.25.  I think that's expensive but maybe others disagree.  The two times we've been there though, we were never disappointed.  I especially liked their boudain balls and the hubby liked the homemade chips.    Everything there is pretty much fried or smothered in sauce and if you know cajun, you know the sauce is not desirable for those watching their weight!  It's a family-owned business and we always try to support that.  If only their prices were more reasonable, we would go there more often but as far as the food goes, Flavors will not disappoint!

We saw the sign to this place off the street and I was intrigued so we stopped by and ordered a chocolate chip bundt.  It was AWESOME!!  I always say that I can never make bundt cake as good as my Mom's even though we use the same recipe.  Don't tell my Mom this but their's is even better!  I guess capitalism trumps love.  =)  I gave it four stars b'c they only had a couple of varieties when we were there.  Also, I was expecting better service.  It wasn't bad but we told the lady it was our first time there and they didn't really say much to us.  Then again, I guess the title of the place says it all.

The food was good but the service was little to be desired.  Both the hubby and I ordered different rice noodle (not pho but the dry kind with fish sauce) with meat on top and the flavor I thought was pretty good.  The menu items are also reasonably priced.  The wait staff, however, could use a little sprucing up.  Our waiter just kind of plopped the plates on our table and left.  No "Enjoy your meal" or "How are things?".  It looks like it's run by a "real" Vietnamese family so you know that all that matters in places like this is that the food is good, which I can't complain about.

OMG, their ice cream is soooooo good.  We had just visited Superstition Farm where we heard about this place and was curious to try it out.  Glad we did!  Seriously, their ice cream was to die for and I wish there was a place I could get it in Buckeye!  At the Farm, we bought their yogurt and for the past couple of days, I've been mixing it with Sprout's granola and it is soooo good.  Ship this stuff out to my side of town!!  PLEASE!!

I think giving this 2 stars is being generous.  For a chocolate affair, there really wasn't a whole lot of chocolate vendors.  It was pretty disappointing.  There's a whole bunch of these type of "festivals" throughout the year and we've been to two of them (the Glitter lights being the other) and both times I have been thoroughly disappointed.  Parking sucks and PRICEY which i wouldn't mind if they weren't such a huge disappointment.    The choco vendors that were there I guess was pretty good but I'd say maybe 30-40% of the vendors there had anything to do with chocolate.  Boo.  :(

My  husband and I shared the egg white veggie omelet and chocolate chip pancakes.  The pancakes were so thick - I LOVED them!!!  The egg white omelets were also pretty good (as good as egg white omelets can be!) and we loved the sausage and potatoes that came along with it.  We were in the area for a quick getaway as the grandparents helped us watch the kiddo.  We live pretty far from here but if we ever had the chance to come here again, we would!!

Compared to similar restaurants (like Pei Wei's and other American Chinese restaurants of that caliber) MeiWei definitely deserves four stars.  They have my favorite dish - eggplants with pork - and it's pretty authentic.  As far as other dishes, like the broccoli beef and hot and sour soup, I would say it is decent.  The lunch prices are very reasonable and their menu prices are comparable to others.  The staff is so-so.  The food definitely isn't "authentic" Chinese food but "American" Chinese food.

I usually go to the PB on McDowell and Estrella and I still prefer that location.  The food here is just as good and so is the service.  Just not too fond of the layout.  Great sandwiches, soups and getting a "free" cookie is definitely a plus!

We come here solely for their custards.  It's delicious and quite caloric.  Did  I say delicious?  Good service, too.  Very polite staff.  The rest of their food is OK.  Probably more like 3 stars but I generally am not a fan of fast food.

The playground here is a lot of fun.  We came here on our way up to Flagstaff and the kiddo loved the playground!  I liked it, too, because you didn't have to do a whole lot of crawling trying to get to your kid.    We had breakfast there and food was par with other McD's.  Good service, too, probably better than average of other McD's I've been to.

First of all, my complaint - only one waitress and serving at least 6 tables.  I totally felt bad for her but with that said, despite the slow service, we still had a great experience.  We ordered the calamari which was delicious.  The Dragon makimono was delicious.  And the yakisoba was good, too.  A little on the salty side for my taste but still pretty yummy.  If you have kids, DON'T bring them here!  Definitely not a great place to take your kids to.  We came here right when they opened, didn't know what the setup was, and my toddler got her drink in a glass hard liquor-type cup.  The waitress was totally cool about it and we lucked out in that the kiddo was in a good mood that day and of course we came during broad daylight and not the evening happy hour crowd!  Great d√©cor.  Very shiek.  The teenager that came with me loved it and loved the lighting.  Overall, we had a great experience.

AWESOME pho.  The hubby had the dry rice noodle dish and his was excellent as well.  The spring rolls were good but I could tell they didn't make it to order.  Anybody who likes spring rolls know that it has to be made WHEN the customer orders or it it's just not as good!

We've been here a couple of times and compared to other RL's, I think this one is above par.  Hence, the 4 stars.  Compared to other places though, probably 2 or 3 stars.  They basically salt and butter the hell out of everything and I feel like the cheese biscuits don't taste as good as they used to and I've been going to RLs since I was a kid.  This specific location though had good service, it was clean, and their cookie dessert was delicious.  If I was in the mood for RL - which isn't often - then this place definitely does the trick.

After much research - both on Yelp and other website searches - I narrowed down my pick to a few companies.  After talking to each of the companies on the phone, I was most impressed with Sorensen.  The lady was helpful, thorough, and knowledgeable - the only one with all three qualities.  Honestly, the other ones had no redeemable qualities whatsoever and they all sounded annoyed to even explain "what's included" in their maintenance package.  Really?  I basically wanted them to come for an annual maintenance check before the summer heat really kicked in.  We had a rough start.  I was cancelled on then rescheduled; I didn't pick up the phone and respond in time on the rescheduled date to let them know it was OK to come so I was cancelled on again and had to wait another week before they could come back out.  I really just wanted to go with someone else at this point but decided against it - good thing.  TIP: RESPOND to their phone call!!  If not, they just go to the next appointment.    So third times a charm.  Now, I don't like dealing with A/C people.  We've had issues in the past with other companies and I always feel like they are selling me something I don't need but when you don't know anything about how stuff like this works, what are you going to do?  You know when your A/C works and you definitely know when it doesn't.  That's the extent of my knowledge.  Needless to say, when Brian started telling me everything wrong with our units, I could feel my blood pressure rising and our wallets shrinking.  BUT ... I will say this, he's the only person who has come to our house and explained stuff that was wrong with our units by giving us a straight answer.  How do I know they were straight answers?  Well, I guess I don't.  I may not know much about how A/C units run but I usually do pretty good when I go with my gut and my gut felt like I could trust these folks.  I've always been given the run around about why the heck our units leaked Freon and always thought something was wrong that we had to keep getting it topped off every year.  Brian on the other hand told me exactly what he would do to fix the Freon leak - something that should never happen to your units by the way, which I knew, but no one has ever properly fixed, even when I asked about it.   Even though this visit instead of costing us a few hundred turned out to be a few thousand, we were given an honest answer on our repairs, I felt.  Our living room never feels like it's cooling down during the height of the summer heat.  Even though we're not at peak heat season yet, I really do feel like the units are all running more smoothly.  I guess only time will tell if the repairs really helped but I'm optimistic that it did!  So we had to forgo our Hawaii vacation and opt for something closer to home this year but if our units continue to run as smoothly as it has for the past few weeks, it was certainly worth it!  I will definitely use these folks in the future.

Great people working here!!  It's a mini-grocery store but has stocked all your necessities including produce, frozen foods, dairies, meats, and a bakery!!  You can't forget about the donuts and alcohol, too.  If you live around the area or are passing by, you should be able to find all your essentials!  I rate it 5 stars for the customer service and location but obviously it would be nice if it were a full-fledged grocery store ... soon I hope!

Found this place on Yelp while we were in the area and thought we'd give it a try.  Great sushi!!  The sushi is on the smaller end but I would imagine that would me more authentic than the big lumps you get at other sushi places.  We ordered the "same number of rolls" as we do at other places but left there still hungry and wanting more ... I guess that is good or bad depending on how you look at it!

Considering the West side of town doesn't have a whole lot of Thai places to chooose from, this place is pretty awesome.  Comparatively speaking to all the Thai places I've been to, I would have given it 3.25 stars.  We got their pad na, pumpkin curry, and pineapple fried rice.  I would say the taste is comprable to to other decent Thai places I've been to in the past.  I'll definitely be looking forward to going again in the future!  A friend took us there and they even mentioned that there's karaoke night.  It would be awesome to check that out one evening!

Not the biggest Apple store I've ever been to but this place is almost always busy.  We had to get our Mac's hard drive replaced and that was the first time we used their Genius service.  We were in and out pretty quick.  I think the key is just to be patient.  Lots of people go there w/o making appointments and although I'm sure they do their best to get you in at your appointment time, they can't always control who goes in w/o an appointment.

I've had their breakfast burrito and didn't think it wasall that great.  It was like too much of nothing special.  If you're looking for just a big-o breakfast burrito to fill you up though, it will not disappoint!  I wasn't impressed with the lunch selection either except for the nachos.  I could feel my arteries clogging just smelling it and there's definitely enough for two or more there!!  If I'm ever up for it again, that's probably what I'd order - their nachos.  Everything else was meh.

I'm guessing all the Starbuck's don't get their food items from the same place or has it just been a while since I've been into one to order and sit down for breakfast?  *shrug*  Anyway, we don't usually go to this SB but decided to stop by here before we headed into downtown.  The croissant and cheese Danish was much tastier than the other SB we go to on Litchfield.  I was surprised b'c I figured they got their stuff from all the same place.  Anyway, there was a constant line so to me that seems they could improve on efficiency ... or maybe they are just that busy.  Overall tough, good service.

My two kids loved going to the instrument room where you can play all the instruments.  Super cool.  The inside of the building is really nice.  Your ($20) entry fee includes the headset.  Steep entry fee but I can see why.  I think there are free days for educators.  Definitely a place worth seeing but a little too expensive to frequent.

Hopefully I have the right location.  If so, this place is only "to-go".  There's some outdoor sitting but you can't go "inside" to order something.  I come here probably a couple times a month and I always get pretty good service.  Really chipper folks but I guess I would be, too, if I was serving coffee all day (and drinking it too - presumably!)  Even when the lines are long, it goes by pretty fast.  They've got it together there.

When this place first opened up it was awesome.  Generous servings is what I've come to expect at any Chipotle b'c, well, I've visited many from the east coast to the west and several in between.    This place is stingy man.  It wasn't before but now it is.  The people that work behind the counter are rude.  One day we went there and I seriously had to ask for "extra" of everything or else my bowl would've looked ... empty.  The lady who took my order was not very nice about it at all, like she was doing me a favor gracing us with her presence.    The cheese quesadilla I used to get my daughter was filled with delicious mozzarella cheese.  Lately, unless I ask for extra cheese, the quesadilla comes out hard, crunchy and barely any cheese on it.  I think in general we just get crappy service in Buckeye but b'c I once knew this location as an awesome place to eat, it's extra disappointing that the service has fallen through the cracks.  The food is no longer consistently good.  And paying for increased prices but less food is just plain disappointing.  I won't not come here b'c it's still a "healthier" alternative than other fast foods but I'm not happy coming here either.

Sometimes the sales advertised isn't what you expected but spending the next 20 minutes of your life trying to get the deal you want isn't worth the trouble.  I think they know that so they make the advertisements purposely obscure!  Having spent a pretty penny at this place for our kiddo's needs and wants is an understatement.  I like how the Babies R Us and Toys R Us are connected.  Makes getting things to get easier.  It's generally well stocked but at times a little messy.  The staff is generally nice and helpful.  Make sure you do price checks ... they hardly ever have the best deal unless u use one of their coupons.

I don't know about it's authenticity as a "New York pizza restaurant" but the food is pretty good and so is the service.  I thought the Sicilian pizza was a little on the expensive side ($19 for half which came out to about 6 square slices) but I haven't had Sicilian pizza enough times to know if the price is par with other places.

I was here a couple of weeks ago and got there early, like 5 minutes before they opened ... at 9am I think.  Total darkness.  I could hear birds chirping but I was like, "Okay, I'll wait a little bit longer."  Five minutes past the hour and still nobody.  First of all, what the heck at opening so LATE IN THE MORNING?!?!?!?!?!?!!  Secondly, why wasn't anybody there when the doors are supposed to open?!  The smoothies aren't bad but the servers really aren't very happy people.  I never get a positive vibe when I go in.  The service is fine just not very chipper people, which is what I expect from a smoothie place.  P.S.  We've been coming here since they opened and the smoothies are decent ... 3 stars definitely but I was just really ticked off that they weren't open ... that's just bad business.

We've been coming here for several months.  My 3 year old daughter loves it.  We've had several instructors (2 main ones) and have had great experiences with each of them.  They all have different styles of teaching the kiddos but each has great patience and loves working with the kids.  I really recommend taking your kiddo here to learn to swim!

There's 2 other Walmarts nearby and comparatively speaking, this one is better stocked and maintained than the ones off of Dysart and Pebble Creek, IMO.  I went to both those locations b'c I was in the area for my frozen okra and they didn't have it.  I didn't get to have my okra fix until two weeks later when I went to the Watson location.  Just sayin', a girl's gotta have her okra.

Good service.  They could work on keeping the tables a little more clean but better than most fast food places.  The playground is for 3 and under I think and it is pretty small but keeps my 2 year old entertained.  Definitely a nice place to stop by for breakfast.  I always think their chicken is on the salty side but every once in a while I like it.

Love it here.  I've actually been a few times already but this is my first review.  This is by far the best froyo in the west valley followed by Yogurtini, Blue Agave, and Dreamland.  I'd skip the latter and stick with either Yogurtland or Yogurtini.  Good service.  Delicious yogurt.  Nice d√©cor and service.  What more do you need?!

We started coming here in late 2000 for a couple of years but ended up moving and subsequently going to a different gym closer to our house.    Flash forward to 7 years later and good god this place has grown.  A lot more people than I remember and a lot more kids.  We joined up again because, well, we had kids and needed childcare, which the gym we switched to did not provide.  This is a full service gym - salon, massage, personal trainers, group classes, pools (indoor and outdoor), kids activities and just in general more family oriented.  There is a separate family locker room, FYI.  If you don't want to pass by crazy kids running around the place then you probably shouldn't come here.  I've only started back up about a week but so far so good.  The towels are always stocked both in the locker room and upstairs.  The staff have been generally helpful.  I'm still looking to start my Move-it session with a PT but they always look busy so I haven't talked to any of the PTs there yet.  The cardio and weights equipment is plentiful.  Seriously, I can't imagine how someone complained about this.  People should learn common gym etiquette when they are around weights - like not hogging up a machine and talking to your mate or texting or whatever.  If you're sitting there, use it.  Otherwise, let someone else use the machine.  Sometimes I'll ask kindly if they are done when I see someone sitting on a machine for a while that I want to use.  I've never had a problem with any gym I've been to about people getting out of the way when asked nicely.  I haven't had too big of a problem with childcare.  My 5 mo old has had a couple of scratches and red marks on him but I'm pretty sure he did it to himself.  The first time nobody said anything, the second time one of the caretakers gave me a heads up.  He seems content when I go pick him up so I'm fairly confident in saying I have nothing to worry about.  However, it IS pretty crazy there and LOTS of kids in the childcare center.  I'm just glad they have the infant section closed off and there has to be a certain childcare giver-infant ratio.  Kind of sucks that I have to call ahead.  I was told by the accounts rep that I call ahead so they have enough people to come in to take care of the babies.  I was told by the childcare staff that if they fill up, I have to make an appointment when there is enough staff which sucks b'c there is a certain time I can make it to the gym.  Two different stories.  I haven't had a problem getting my baby in yet so hopefully this issue will not come up.  *fingers crossed*

My experience is with their out patient/day surgery unit.  We were warmly greeted at every step of the process.  From finding out where we needed to go, to registration, getting prepped and post-surgery, everything went pretty smoothly.  Friendly, courteous staff.  I was surprised thought how quickly they get you in and out.  Although I never felt like anything was rushed, I've been on the "waiting end" of day surgery and remember the whole process taking longer than 4 hours.  If I remember correctly, we were in by 0600 and out by 1000, give or take.  Don't get me wrong, I guess it's a good thing to get out of there as soon as possible but I was just surprised at how quickly it all happened.

Really good service!!  I had to start out with that because the past couple of places we visited although the food was good, service unimpressive at best.  We had their lunch buffet and the food was fresh, even in the late afternoon towards the end of the buffet time.  They brought us fresh naan and came by to see how we were doing.  Maybe it was because we had a cute kid with us but we felt very welcomed there.    Good service, good food.  It doesn't get much better than that.

The first time I ever had Five Guys was at the Reagan Airport.  I didn't get to it until an hour later and it was still delicious.  Been to this location twice and every time going there hits the spot.  Sharing a medium order of fries with a friend is PLENTY and their mini-sized burgers are just right.  Guys will probably like the "regular" ones since they come with two patties.  My husband was skeptical when I took him to this place but now he requests it ... and we have to drive to Scottsdale all the way from Buckeye!

Nice place to take the kiddos.  Not a whole lot of stuff to play with but it's relatively affordable compared to a Chuc E. Cheese's.  I've been to 2 PP locations and I definitely like this one more.  Feels cleaner.  Friendly staff (the other location's staff was good, too).  Overall experience here was probably better just 'cuz we came here on a Monday afternoon when there's not a whole lot of people.  Great place to let your kids exert some energy!  Pizza's not bad either!

We came here looking for something light to eat.  Definitely light and definitely good!!  The waiter was very nice, likes to call you hun, love, sweetie.  He was also patient with us since it was our first time there and didn't know what to order.  We got the chicken wrap, teriyaki tofu bowl with fruit and gazpacho.  First time having gazpacho so I can't compare it with any other place but I thought it was good.  Wish they gave more fruit so my daughter could eat more of it but it's all good.  I really liked the teriyaki tofu bowl.  The sauce isn't overpowering like some places her and it wasn't "congealed" like a lot of teriyaki bowls can get so definitely a plus!  If you are looking for a decent place to eat with simple food, simple ingredients, this is definitely a place to stop by!  Great lemonade and iced tea, too!

For older kids with good gross motor skills, prob a great place for them.  For my 1 year old, meh, she is better off at a park.  I called ahead of time and asked if it was appropriate for her to go and they said to come early but there's definitely things for her to play on.  Well, there were two bounce houses and the trampoline and that was it.  The kiddo didn't much like the bounce houses but she did thoroughly enjoy the trampoline ... for about 15 minutes.  Our pass cost us $4.25 so we paid $4.25 to play about 15 minutes.  I guess that's not the establishment's fault but it did suck we couldn't do much after that.  The trampoline was sectioned off though for just 7 year olds and under so I will give them credit for that.  We as parents could also supervise our baby and was not charged.    I think this is a great place to take your older kids but for your younglings, maybe not so much but then again, maybe it was just our kid!  Two bounce houses and a trampoline though ... not exactly a large play selection for our 15 mo old!

Let me first say, the environment was great, the staff was cordial, and the food decent.  I'm giving only 2 stars for, quite frankly, one main reason: the food took a very long time to make.  Our entire dinner took 2 hours and the first hour was waiting for the food.  The place was busy but not filled so quite frankly, there should be no reason for this inconvenience.  I will come here again and give them a second chance because our meals were good and I look forward to having their specially made sushi selection.  It just won't be for a very long time because they need to figure out how to manage the staff first.  We have a sushi place we LOVE (Tomo's) so H's has a lot to live up to.  The Environment.  You can do hibachi, hang at the bar or have a sit down.  The environment is pretty foo-foo and definitely restauarant-y and not some hole-in-a-wall.  Probably a good date place but there were families there, too.  The staff.  They were initially out of menus and hubby and I had to share.  Luckily, the hostess was able to snag another one but that was our first impression.  Not a good one.  Well, our first impression was actually having to wait for almost 10 minutes to be seated when there were obviously plenty of empty tables, just not enough staff.  Our waitress was very apologetic b'c of the long wait and constantly asked us if we needed anything.  I'd rather have that than be ignored but she probably could have toned it down a bit.  Actions speak more than words and for the time we had to wait for our food, they really should have given us a discount instead of just saying "I'm sorry" 20 times.  The food.  We were in the mood for cooked food so we got the Bento A and B - salmon (a) and beef (b).  It came with rice, tempura, shumai, miso soup, and salad.  Mine also came with a california roll and hubby's came with 4 pieces of sushi.  The salad, soup, and main meal all came at the same time because of the backup which really sucked.  The breading on the tempura didn't taste "light" like a tempura should taste (you know what I'm talking about - the difference you get between calling it a tempura or basically just fried shrimp).  The rest of the food was pretty good.  Miso soup tasted lighter than most places which I loved.  I've had better california roll but it does pass muster.  The menu.  There was a pretty good variety of stuff there between hot and sushi.  They had some interesting sushi selections that I'd like to try next time but just didn't feel like having that day.  Our meals came with the basics and hubby commented on the 4 sushi pieces he had with his Bento A meal "It was OK but I have had better."  I didn't try his so I can't comment.  I liked their California roll that came with my dish (but I have had better).  They have descriptions of the various rolls (which most places that cater to Americans do) so that will be helpful in your decision-making.  If you're testing this place out, I would visit when it's not peak hours.  It's definitely worth a shot.  It just wasn't worth the time (i.e. long wait).

The buffet here is quite nice.  Comparable to the decent Asian ones I used to frequent in Houston.  I'm not really much of a buffet person though so take my review as  you wish.  Lots of variety, ate my favorite seafoods, didn't get sick afterward.  4 stars.

We had a great experience there with Suzanne.  We ended up getting the Grano glider/recliner, Vola ottoman and Ninna Nanna bassinet.  It wasn't cheap but the workmanship looks amazing and we'e willing to pay more for quality.  We are definitely expecting the furniture to last and can't wait until it comes in.  If there is one thing you want to splurge on, here is the place to get it.  I would definitely buy from the Biltmore location again.  We visited the one on High Street, too, and the sales person there wasn't as personable.  Had we got there first, we probably would not have been as impressed.  Maybe it was just one of those days but I will say, having someone there who can provide great service is really an added bonus and gets people to want to spend at your establishment.

WOW, this is a really nice Fry's.  Reminds me of a Whole Foods with their selection of ready-made foods (fruits, salads, mushrooms, cheese etc).  I didn't even know about this place until the hubby and I accidentally stumbled upon it trying to get to the Super Target.  We ended up getting groceries here instead and loved it!  I think this is my new fave grocery place.  I think their prices are a bit more expensive though so planning will be key to coming here.

Holy cow this place is delicious!  Definitely comparable to Sprinkles ... I tried the German chocolate and it was divine.  It's definitely nice to have a gourmet cupcake place on our side of town.  I'd love to order a custom cake for our next shindig!

Yummy ice cream. Good service.  I don't remember their ice cream melting so fast but maybe it was just b'c my daughter couldn't keep up!  There's a few tables to sit at so that's always nice.

This place got really good reviews so we decided to give it a try.  I don't know if we just ordered the wrong stuff or the sushi chef was having a bad day or what but I really didn't think their rolls were all that good.  We ordered a few rolls from their happy hour menu: Philadelphia, crunch, California and some sort of shrimp/avocado roll.  The rice was dry and had no flavor!  I think they forgot the vinegar!    We also ordered the following:  Edamame: I've never seen so many of the beans out of its pod!  It tasted about par with other places though.  Gyoza: I always thought they were different (but similar) to Chinese dumplings but here, it was EXACTLY like a Chinese dumpling.  Tasted OK.  Veggie fried rice: They used really sticky (I'm assuming sushi) rice to make it.  I wouldn't mind it so much if I wanted sticky rice but we ordered fried rice ... usually the rice is a lot looser.  Miso soup: really bland and I am one who usually prefers bland food.  Seaweed salad: By far my favorite.  At other places it's usually a huge salad entr√©e so it was nice they had a small side of it I could order.  Great flavor.  Perfection.  I would at least give this place a try again.  I just can't imagine this place getting such good reviews but the sushi tasting the way it did.  I can only assume it was an off day.  The service was good though and they have booth seats which is always a plus when you  have a toddler!  On the (far) West side, my barometer for good sushi is usually comparing the new place I try to Tomo's off of Dysart/McDowell, the Japanese food restaurant we frequent most.

We come here mainly to take my daughter to the weekly playgroup that Phoenix Children's Hospital (I believe) sponsors.  She loves it!!  There's a really good selection of kids books.  I'm not much of a reader (gasp!) so I can't say much about the adult selection but hubby (who is a reader) seems to like it.  I think they have a thing online where you can request a book to be available at a specific library so you can always go that route.  The best thing about this library is its location.  Granted, out of the way and nothing near by but homes and a BEAUTIFUL view of the White Tanks.  If I didn't have a kid, I would just sit in there all afternoon with a book or magazine and check out the gorgeous landscape.  The architecture is also very nice.  Simple, crisp and blends well with the landscape.  The library is connected to the park so before or after your time at the library, you can always do a hike!  If  you are in the area, definitely check it out!

Love Jacqueline Hanna Photography! We've used her for our baby's milestone photo shoots (two thus far) and have enjoyed every session!  Very easy to work with, offers wonderful suggestions but is never pushy about anything.  We've really enjoyed working with her and our little one loves her, too!

This restaurant is delicious.  YUM.  Fresh tasting peanut sauce on the spring rolls ... and delicious spring rolls.  It's small and the d√©cor is trendy.  I saw kids there but if I were you I'd try to avoid busy times b'c it's not too big.  Good service.  A little on the expensive side but they serve a mean lychiejito.

So a friend of mine who is visiting from out of state told me about this place.  She raved so much about it that I just had to try it before I went back home!  OMG, the donuts here are DELICIOUS.  SO FREAKIN' DELICIOUS.  The service was little to be desired (maybe she was having a bad day but not even a smile from her!) but the donuts spoke for themselves.

We come here pretty frequently.  I've never had Mongolian stir fry in other restaurants b'c the only other place I've seen them at is at buffets and there's just other things to eat there!  I have, however, been to several other Genghis Grill and this on as far as service goes, is pretty good.  We've had a decent experience just about every time we've gone there.  I like this one more than the one on the NE side of town at the Tempe Marketplace.  As far as food goes, I should just rate myself, right, and not GG?  In which case, I give myself 5 stars!  I'm really good at mixing sauces!  If you've never been to a Mongolian BBQ joint, basically, the food is raw, you pick up what  meats, veggies, spices and sauces  you want and they will cook for you on this like big open griddle thing.  Good stuff.    I think they have a pretty good selection of meats and veggies and  yes, sometimes it's a little messy but I would say they are usually on top of making sure the counters are clean.  The mess usually comes from the veggies that fall out of people's bowl.  You put the meats in the bowl first so it is unlikely it will come out of the bowl and contaminate the counter.  Unlikely I say but I'm sure possible.  My only complaint is how they changed their pricing structure.  Years ago when we used to frequent a GG in Dallas, it was once price, all you can eat.  I never packed my bowl the way I do now and if anything probably got less food because I didn't feel like I had to "get my money's worth".  Now if you want all you can eat, it's a different price than if you got just one bowl.  I was taken aback by that the first time we went to this place b'c it had been  years since we had been to one.  If you are curious about trying a place like this, I definitely recommend!  If you feel intimidated, don't be.  The waitresses are very helpful and they also have these "cards" you can pick up that tell  you what ingredients to pick if you don't feel adventurous enough to make your own.  My tip to you: PACK IN THE FOOD. Use your hands and push down if you have to.  THat's what we do.  One bowl is PLENTY.  Most of all, have fun!

I don't consider myself a burger connoisseur so take this FWIW but by golly I thought their brulee burger was delicioso!  It was a perfect blend of salty and sweet - just a tiny hint of it.  I really enjoyed it and would drag my butt from the far west side again to have it.  The tator tots and French toast fries were both OK.  I'm a seasoned fries kind of girl.  The d√©cor is simple.  The service was excellent.  They gave generous sized cups for water and I'm very grateful as I do not drink cola.  Would love to come again!!

I have yet to actually come here and learn to shoot a gun.  My husband keeps coming to get me into a class but they are always full.  Needless to say, I'm a little annoyed but I've heard their classes are good.  I'm not a gun enthusiast but we have one at home and I should feel comfortable around them so please Shooter's World, I need to sign up!

I got there when they opened.  I was in and out in less than an hour.  No complaints there.  However, I was surprise by the price.  2 tires cost about $210 but tacking on "this and that" my total came out to $300+.  I probably should've reviewed the charges more but I was really surprised by this.  I blame myself for that.  Trust but verify.

UGH, I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 star b'c of my husband's persuasion.  This place is TERRIBLE!!  I am by no means a picky, mean, or rude customer.  They guy behind the counter just treated us like we owed him a big friggin' thank you for making us a sub par meal.  I had the chicken mango chipotle (or something like that) nachos.  Blech.  Hubby had a burrito which was also blech.  I will definitely not come here again.  When someone says "thank you", you should say "your welcome" back or something to acknowledge your customer.  These people need retraining in their customer service skills.  To boot, the food was terrible.

We've been coming here for a few years now.  Not often but every once in a while.  When we first started coming, I thought the food was pretty awesome.  Since the, however, I feel like there's been a steady decline.  Today just kind of topped it.  The service was fine - nothing to complain about.  However, the chicken was so DRY!  And I saw a little bit of blood!  When we first came here we bought extra chicken for left overs.  Never did it again because although initially the chicken was yummy and juicy, the leftovers was dry and not good at all.  That's what our chicken tasted like today.  I was very disappointed.  Needless to say, we probably won't be coming back here.  That really sucks.

We've come here several times and their smoothies are great!  Haven't tried their food yet, however.  The prices of their smoothies are very reasonable and their taste is comparable to Smoothie King or Jamba.  Check it out if u r in the area!

HOLY CANOLI this place rocks!  The ice cream is pretty run of the mill but if you mix it with the deliciously chewy cookies, you're in heaven.  My toddler got a kick out of the "bites" on the chairs.  She kept staring at them.  Would love to come back again.  Definitely worth it ... and you can't beat the price!

This was our first time visit.  I guess the best thing to do is come early to eat your dinner ... or order something that's more conducive to eating in the dark.  Both my husband and I ordered a salad.  Although they were really good salads, it was kind of inconvenient to eat in the dark!    I love the concept though and the service there was amazing.  We were greeted at every step of the process from entering, to getting the tickets, to entering the theatre, someone always said hi to us.  It was refreshing to get such nice service so thank you for that SMG!  So next time we come here we will definitely have to get something that's easier to eat in the dark!  Other than that, our experience here was great.

Typically, I give places 2 stars b'c it wasn't good.  My idea of rating is 3 and up is acceptable.  In this case, I just couldn't get myself to give this establishment 3 stars even though there wasn't anything wrong about it.  However, it was exactly as Yelp has helped us with the ratings: "Meh.  I've experienced better."  I got the eggplant parm and it was OK.  the eggplant itself was good but it tasted like it was fried in "old oil" if you know what I mean.  If it was fresh oil, I bet it would've been better.  The mash potato that came with it was pretty decent actually would probably give that 3 stars.  The husband had their french dipped sandwich.  Again, he was like, "it was OK".  Our one  year old had the quesadilla and it was ok, too ... but we've had better  The ambience hasn't changed much since it used to be McGrath's.  The service was decent.  Our waitress was very nice to our party of 6 plus a 1 year old.

The food deserves 5 stars but the service 3 stars.  It wasn't bad but the poor waitress had her work cut out for her with quite a few patrons to tend to.  She also had quite the accent but that doesn't bother me ... makes it all the more authentic.  It just makes ordering a little ... adventurous.  Food was AWESOME.  We had the pad na (big noodles) and it's one of the best we ever had.  We also ordered the pumpkin curry which the hubby thoroughly enjoyed.  A little on the spicy end but of course that's all relative.  We also had the bbq pork and that is probably one of the best I've ever had.  Most places the pork is brown but this place it was white and so so tender!  They even drizzled some of the bbq sauce on it which usually you do not see.  At least I haven't.  The decor is nice and service was decent as long as you come in with a positive attitude.  Big cups for water which is also a plus!  We will definitely come again!

They have really yummy flavors.  Deeeelish.  The times we've been there, they don't have like a huge variety of flavors but definitely enough to get different ones for half a dozen, maybe a dozen.  THat's good enough for me!  Pretty big cupcakes.  I think I'd rather have mine smaller but the flavors I've had there are delicious.  We definitely like coming here for  a treat!

If you don't want to read through my drama, just beware to DOUBLE CHECK your order if you come here.  The food is fine - like any other MacDonald's - but they have a tendency of getting orders wrong ... for me anyway and no, I do not ask for any kind of unreasonable custom order.  I am putting my grievance here because the managers there just don't seem to care.  On several occasions this particular Micky D's has gotten my order wrong.  A nuisance at first but I was willing to let it go one time ... two times ... three times.   About a month ago, I'd already lost track how many times they have gotten our order wrong.  I didn't have a receipt but I did call the manager because I wanted to let them know they should work on training employees about reviewing orders.  It has happened one too many times for me not to speak up.  She was apologetic and even tried to rectify the situation, "Come by next time and I'll still let you get your order for free.  Tell them Corrinda said it was ok."  I was like, "Whoa, that was awfully generous" and thanked her.  A couple of weeks later, I had to take my daughter to the ER for a scorpion bite.  This Micky D's is barely a block away so I sent the husband to get our dinner.  "They forgot my McNuggets."  Well, this stressed out mamma with a screaming baby in the ER with the worst pain that anyone could possibly imagine was not going to take this sitting down.  I drove back to the Micky D's with our order and receipt and asked to see the manager.  I told her about our most recent experience in addition to the missing McNuggets.  She was apologetic, saying her minimal, obligatory apology and sent me on my way.  She said something about just starting but that got me even more pissed off that she was defending getting orders wrong.  There's no excuse.  Don't even get me started on the fact that she hardly spoke English, which I believe may have contributed to her reticent behavior.  Come on now, at the managerial level, communication with customers is pretty vital I would think.  I left flabbergasted that my money wasn't refunded - not even that it wasn't refunded but it wasn't even offered -  but I knew I had to take a breather because my daughter needed a mamma who was calm and collected.  No point in getting steaming mad.  "You got your nuggets so just let it go!" I told myself.    The next day I decided to get our "free breakfast" because it was a hellish night before to get up early and make breakfast for everyone.  When I dropped Corrinda's name to the cashier and how she was going to comp my next order, she asked for a receipt, I said I didn't have one, and she was going to ask the manager what to do.  A minute later she came back and told me they couldn't give me the breakfast for free if there was no receipt.  I told her get the manager out here so I can explain.  She goes to the back again and comes back out a couple minutes later and says that the manager approved.  Again, I wonder if this is a training issue because i would have expected for this  manager to come out and talk to me.  The restaurant itself is nice and there is a playground.  The food is fine - tastes like MacDonald's.  I will be coming here as little as possible for the sole fact that my orders have been incorrect on so many occasions that I've lost count.  The manager's don't seem to have a good handle on training their employees and the managers themselves don't seem to know how to handle customer issues.

Didn't even get to try the food. They were closed, saw a person come out of the place, tried to figure out what was going on and got no explanation. I guess I'm not going I waste 45 min to drive here ever again to try their famous stuffed French toast on the off chance they may actually be open and I'd be treated a little more nicely.

Great food!  Nice staff, nothing fancy but down to earth, which is perfect for a bbq joint!  I usually don't mention stuff like this but thought it was strange that the decor was decent (the tables have that shiny tinge to them) but the food is served on styrofoam.  It just didn't match.  But you're not here to listen to me talk about their decor.  Hubby got the pulled pork and it was delicious.  We're from south Texas so we know pulled pork!  Well, mostly him; HE knows pulled pork.  It was so good he said it gave him heartburn!  (He doesn't usually eat to the point of getting heartburn!)  I had the pork ribs, half rack ... very meaty and the sauce was AWESOME.  Wasn't as sweet as most places which I liked.  I ate my husband's potato salad because it was that good (I'm pretty picky about my potato salads).  My 13mo old daughter had a hot dog and she ate up the whole dog.  The fries were also pretty tasty!!  I didn't care much for the baked beans but I'm not really a baked beans kind of person.  I would say the baked beans were par with other places.  I would definitely give this place another go ... and another.  We really felt like having bbq and didn't want to drive 45 minutes+ for it so when I found this place on Yelp, I knew I had to give it a try ... and I wasn't disappointed!

Coffee is really good, service is terrible.  The service isn't bad per say but they are either understaffed or the folks behind the counter aren't trained very well dealing with customer traffic.  I've been there when 5 or 6 people are in line and when there's only 1 or two ahead of me and either times - whether it's 2 guys or 1 guy behind the counter - it takes forever to get my order.  It's like these guys can't work in a rhythm.  With that said though, their coffee is pretty decent, especially their iced drinks.  Plus they have a good variety of drinks, including boba.    Looks like since they opened though they've focused mainly on coffee and other beverages.  They used to have some filipino treats which has dwindled in variety.  You can find it here and there but not in abundance.  Right outside of Macy's in the mall.

Very friendly service, super delicious donuts.  What more can you ask for?    The eat-in area is a tad small but that is expected for a donut joint.  There are tables though.  The donuts are a tad on the small side but that's probably a good thing!

Both the husband and I came here for new shoes.  The hubby needed running shoes and I needed a good pair of comfortable "every day, all purpose" shoes.  We were fitted and the lady even asked us questions regarding how we walk, watched our gait, and explained to us why we needed shoes bigger than what we're measured (your feet expand when you work out).    I have to admit I was a little intimidated coming here b'c I figured all they look at all day are fit  runners (which I'm not ... not even close!) but the sales associate (sorry, I forgot her name!) was really nice and I felt at ease.    I would definitely come here again!

We've been to several froyo places around town and this is by far one of the best ones.  Lots of yogurt selections and a TON of toppings selection.  I don't ever remember paying $10 for 2 froyos before so we either got more than usual or their price is more expensive than others.    The taste was excellent, too.  Tasted how froyo should taste like and not mushy.  As I was paying for the yogurts, I noticed Sirachi hot sauce and asked the cashier why it was there.  Apparently people like to put it in the mango yogurt.  What?!  I doubt I'll have the courage to do that.  Maybe when I get pregnant again.  Haha.  GREAT place.  You definitely won't be disappointed.

I can't decide between 3 or 4 stars but since my husband says it's a solid 4, I'll bump it!  I had the beef and mushroom sandwich and it was AWESOME.  My husband loved his rainbow burger.  The chips were good, too.    Nice d√©cor.  A little hipster but I like to think of myself as hip.  Pretty good service.  Our 8 meals came out kind of staggered so we all ate at different times but it's all good.  So why was I deciding between 3 and 4 stars?  The fries.  It's the flavored kind, which is fine but my one of my barometers for a good restaurant is how their fried food tastes and the fries here tasted like they're waiting too long to change out the oil in the fryer.  Plus they didn't have a veggie patty which sucked b'c I love veggie patties.  I definitely think it's worth giving a shot.  We should support our local businesses and this place delivers!

As far as Chuck E Cheeses go, I thought this place was fairly "clean" compared to others.  They had hand sanitizers throughout.  Albeit on the small end, the kids had a great time - ages ranging from almost 2 years old to 8 years old.  I would go there again.

I'm torn between 1 and 2 stars.  The service was decent.  It took them a while to refill our drinks but other than that, we had a good experience.  We got the nachos.  Maybe it's a east coast thing but it came with chili.  The chili wasn't bad but I was not expecting it with my nachos.  I swear the menu said cheese "sauce" but the cheese on their just looked like microwaved shredded cheese.  Very skimpy on the sour cream.  I'm comparing these nachos to Moe's (which closed down near the arena) ... yum, their "liquid gold" - now that's a cheese sauce!  We also ordered wings which were ok.  Not as good as Buffalo Wild Wings, IMO.  The salt and pepper flavor was quite tasty actually.  I dunno ... I might give this place one more try.  Our overall experience was "meh, I've had better" but seriously, I can't get over the nachos.  This place is obviously popular - they are all over town - so maybe we just didn't order the "right thing".

My husband's been wanting to try this place so we decided to check it out on one of our trips into Phoenix.  Very friendly staff, simple menu, very delicious food.  I can't really explain what the sandwiches are like.  You just have to try it out.  It's like a closed in sandwich but when you bite into it, there's just a burst of delicious goodness.  Although I wasn't "full" after our sandwich (they're not very big but I would say probably the size of a sandwich that we SHOULD be eating) I was very satisfied.  Next time we're in the area I'd definitely go back.  Their green iced tea was yummy too!

I came here for an alignment.  My sales guy at  Discount Tire was pretty adamant that I needed one so he gave me a coupon for $10 off at Brakes Plus.  I had great service from beginning to end.  I think the person who helped me out was named Tip and he was so nice.  He told me from the get-go what was going to happen to my car.  He told me up front that they didn't have any openings until 10am (I got there at 8am) so I had options to choose from.  Got a call about 15 minutes after he told me it was going to be ready but I think that's reasonable.    Biggest tip is get an appointment.  I tried to get one the night before but couldn't for some reason so I thought going there first thing in the morning would get me in, but I was wrong.  I should have called in the morning and would've saved some time.  So yeah, make an appointment!

Smaller than other Five Guys places but a great burger nonetheless.  I don't remember spending $28 for 2 adults and a child but maybe I'm just not remembering right.  Seemed high but we still enjoyed our meal.  If you like Five Guys in general this place doesn't disappoint.  Great staff, great food and I love all the variety of sodas.    If you've never had five guys, their burgers are awesome.  It is super greasy, however.  I personally like In and Out better but my husband like's Five Guys.  I don't usually pick a burger joint when it is my turn to choose where we're going to eat so it has been a while since we've been to an I/O but the husband is extremely happy to have a Five Guys in the area.  You should definitely try this place if you are curious.  You can judge for yourself since everybody has a different idea of what a good burger should taste like.  Oh yeah, and they have a variety of toppings you can put in the burger - a definite plus.  The "junior" sizes is PLENTY.  The regular size I think is the same; they  just double the patty.

Fresh ingredients, delicious food, good service.  Minus 1 star b'c it was a little confusing to get around the menu and for a buffet line with people behind the counter making your food, the whole process didn't run very efficiently.  Overall though, great experience.

Seen this place in passing many-a-times.  First time visiting today and what a lovely experience!  The staff there brings out such a great vibe.  I left there happy just seeing smiling faces.  More places need to follow suit!  Coffee is good.  I'm a Starbuck's kind of girl - well, really Seattle's Best but that's hard to come by nowadays without Border's - so that's my palette.  I thought DB was good but different preference.  I had the coconut mocha one.  It was really good though, just different.  This location is normally not on my route to anything.  Just happen to be by it today and I'm really glad I tried it.  There's one they are building closer by to my house and i'm looking forward to it getting built!

Their food is packed with flavor.  A little too much for me to be honest but I still really enjoyed coming here.  The fellas behind the counter were very nice.  Awesome ingredients to choose from.  It' cool how you can pick and choose what you want in your bowl  If we are in the area we would definitely come back again!

"Meh, I've experienced better."  The service was good.  Lady was cordial and greeted us so kudos to her for that.  However, the yogurt itself was not that great and I have been to several froyo places.  The froyo here tastes kind of icy, like it's been there a while if you know what I mean.  Not the creamy-ish kind that I like (and presume how froyo "shoud" taste like).  Anyway, if I'm ever in the area and have a hankering for froyo, I perhaps will try again b'c service was decent but for the most part, I'd go to other froyo places that I enjoy more.

We ordered a taro boba and plain iced tea.  Pretty good!  Boba was fresh.  Decent service.  Nicely decorated.  They even have froyo.  No baby changing station though.  Yes, that is important to some parts of the population.  I'd come back again to try other flavors.

The good:  Nice atmosphere, delicious food, fresh ingredients and lovely dessert. The bad: slow service and our waiter was a bit absent-minded, but nice enough.

I had the rice, pork chop, and shredded pork dish.  Compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in the area, it's above par.  Compared to other bigger cities like Houston, L.A., NY probably 3, 3.5 stars.  The flavor was good, but the menu lacked variety.  Simplicity can be a good thing, too, though.  Next time, I want to try their Pho.  I just felt like rice and meat today but the true test of a good Vietnamese restaurant is the Pho broth!

So we just happen to see this place and decided to take my toddler in for a treat.  We came in on a Saturday.  There were (literally) a handful of dessert items in the display and very few baked goods (like the Asian breads).  I asked the lady what was up with that and she said shipments come during the week.  1.)  I guess they don't make it in the store but it's called a bakery?  2.) She specifically said to come on Tuesdays so that leads me to believe the baked goods are not fresh daily.    What they did have out, however, looked beautiful.  Just like how I remember an Asian bakery should be ... except sparse ... and not fresh.  So we had a couple of things.  The taro boba wasn't good at all.  It just tasted icy.  It didn't have any of the rich texture that I'm used to.  We also had a chocolate pound cake type dessert.  It wasn't very sweet - which I like - and my husband noticed there were no chocolate chips.  Well, it's not an American pastry store silly.  I really wanted to like this place b'c I hardly go to the COFCO Center nowadays.  There's just not much there except the grocery store so it's not really worth the 45 minute drive for me.  Having a bakery would've totally given me an incentive.  Next time we go to the area I'd like to come during the weekday, preferably on a Tuesday.   Maybe you will have better luck than me!

Delicious ice cream.  Seriously, delicious.  It's in a converted house.  Very tiny, no tables inside but there are a few outdoors.  The lady at the counter was super sweet.  (pun!)  We would definitely come here again!

A neighbor recommended Tom after our garage door went out.  He came out, checked out the problem and gave us our options.  He didn't even charge us for the initial inspection and gave us time to think about what we wanted to do.    We ended up opting for the more expensive option.  Sucks to do this during the Holidays but we ended up with a great deal.  It took them a couple of hours to install it and he came back the next day (had to find the right paint color for the door) to paint the door.  We're really happy with our new door and it runs so much quieter than our old door!  Tom was great to work with and I felt like he was honest about our garage door malfunctioning and how to fix it.    Our only problem was on both days he ran late (understandably so in his industry) and didn't call.  It didn't bother me enough to "deduct points" but I usually like to know what's going on when I've given up my day to wait for someone.  Overall, we had a great experience and would definitely recommend to our friends and neighbors.

Was not impressed.  We ordered take out and got their family meal ... something like 3 dishes with rice, noodles and egg rolls for around $35.  Great deal and a LOT of food but it did not taste good.  They put way too much corn starch to thicken the sauce (which is normal but the over did it) and the broccoli was waaaay too soggy.  Our egg rolls were over cooked or the oil wasn't clean b'c they were way too dark and had like burnt spots.  Mapo tofu wasn't bad.  I asked for non-spicy and they cooked it as requested.  Broccoli beef was terrible - the broccoli was way too soft (and I actually don't mind soft broccoli but seriously, this went overboard) and like I said, too much cornstarch.  I thought the sweet and sour pork wasn't bad but apparently the hubby didn't like it.  Go figure 'cuz I'm the Asian one inthe relationship!  Places like these, I definitely think you need to try for yourself b'c our tastebuds are so different but coming from somebody who knows Chinese food, I wasn't impressed the least bit ... except for the quantity ... very generous portion!

First let me say, it's awesome that a coffee place opened up where the service is at least decent.  Nice folks behind the counter.   However, I got a frozen coffee and quite frankly, it wasn't any different than if I had made it myself ... with the brewed coffee I keep in my fridge for the week.  In fact, I make it even better because I make sure there are no ice chunks in my frozen beverage.  Nothing special about their iced tea either.  As my husband said, "it was nothing like drinking polar bear" which is what he describes as really awesome iced tea.  (I know strange but that's his thing)  I will give this place a couple more tries: 1) B'C they said they make homemade muffins and well, I love muffins and 2) when they open up the restaurant portion b'c I'm really hoping to have an awesome place nearby to get a meal.  If you want me to keep coming back, go talk to the folks at Sugar N Spice down on Indian School RD.  We literally crave that place.  They have an awesome staff and an awesome bakery with awesome beverages.  I'd love to be able to have a hang out place like that closer to home!  With all that said, I realize they are just starting out and to support local businesses I'd like to give this place another try but I don't want to just "settle" coming here because it's close by.  I want to love going there!

I don't know much about the nerdy-geek culture except by observing my husband and he drooled at this place.  Lots of old school toys, action figures, what have you.  He also found some comic books he's been looking for.  Very cozy space packed with lots and lots of goodies so beware of taking your younglings here.  I brought my toddler and had to tell her "don't touch!" like every few seconds.  Luckily, we left without breaking anything!

A whole lot of rules for a whole lot of nothing. My daughter and I got kicked out today because I did not wear socks. She was having a perfectly good time socializing on her own. All I was doing was sitting down monitoring her and happy that she was making friends while relieved to be battling nausea without having to constantly entertain my kid. Ruin that for me. Who cares about the customer who asked nicely by the way if I could remember the socks for next time. My last $10 was used on lunch so no I don't have money to buy your overpriced socks.   Every indoor playground I've been to has never required the adult to wear socks. There is absolutely nothing there that would warrant an adult to wear socks. The equipment are made for young children. Adults cannot physically get onto anything. We just stand there or sit. I understand requiring kids to wear them to slow down and all but see no need for the adult. Rules are rules I guess.   This place seriously needs to work on their customer service skills. If you require socks from everyone then maybe you should kindly ask them if everybody has socks on before punching the stamp card, let the kid play for 15 minutes and then kick them out for not having socks. When I go to the Playground in Peoria I'm always asked if kiddo is wearing socks before our punchcard is punched...and I'm a regular there so they know me and still ask.   I have 2 more punches left on my card.  I've pretty much made up my mind that I won't be getting a new one.  Rules that don't make sense, equipment that you can buy at Toys R Us, and rigid customer service.  I'm pretty much done.   That's my rant. Parents if you have young kids, they will enjoy coming here and it is clean but all that just doesn't matter when you have a bad experience. Just remember everyone is required to wear socks.   My editorial on the Yates comment on FB. Totally inappropriate. I wasn't bothered by it personally. This happened years ago. There's no reason to bring up such a controversial topic and have people associate your establishment with negativity. As Americans we have the right to free speech so from that perspective I can see why the owner specifically said she's not apologizing for her comments. However, you choose to use your business as a soundbox for your opinions then you will suffer the consequences of those actions whether positive or negative. You will alienate people who don't agree with your opinions and potentially lose them. Your customers should matter and quite frankly it doesn't seem like they do.  Edit in response to owner: The owner wants to argue semantics so I will clarify. I was not literally kicked out. I was told I needed socks; I didn't have socks; owner said nothing else to me except, "Everyone is wearing them. That's the rule," so my only solution was to leave.   I have no problems following the rules.  What I have a problem with is how you handled the situation.  Instead of working with your customer, you choose to repeat the same thing over again when I tried to work with you - everyone else is wearing them, that's the rule.  Yes, I know the rules.  People make mistakes-we forget.  I didn't know I was expected to remember everything I read in a waiver and purchase agreement.    What I have a problem with is you taking my money (ie punchcard), letting us play for 15 minutes and then telling me to wear socks.  Again, if sock wearing is so imperative and you are so concerned about babies getting foot germs, ask about socks BEFORE you punch someone's card.  For the record you did not offer to sell socks to me.  I only found out from reading another review on Yelp after I got home.  You could have easily fixed the situation by saying hey, come back with socks and I'll let you back in or provided a refund.  You could have told me to not move around the room and just stay seated unless my kid needed me or to just be careful not to step on baby toys which I noticed were in one specific area of the playroom.  There's also a sitting area right by the playroom entrance which you could have offered to let me sit.  As a business owner you resolve issues with your customers.  Not tell your customers rules are rules and offer no alternative.  That's my point.  Say something that shows the customer you care and that you're trying to work with them.  Instead, I left distressed with an upset toddler who wanted to stay.    For the record, I was never whispered to.  We were quite a distance from each other for any whispering to occur.  You did not tap my shoulder as I do not like being touched and would have remembered the incident had it occurred.    Customer service goes a long way, especially for small businesses.  Rules are important.  So is compromise and solutions.  I suggest you take the reviews here as constructive criticism.  You can run your business your way, or you can run your business the right way.  Only one of those ways will get customers to come back.

We've been taking our 3 year old here for ice skating lessons and the kiddo loves it. At first I was apprehensive - I mean really, she just learned to walk 2 years ago! - but she really enjoys it and I give the instructors all the credit. I think they do a great job at getting her comfortable on the ice without being pushy.  The students' ages vary but bc the skill level is the same for each group it works out. I was worried that being with older kids my daughter would get trampled on or something. Haha.   We signed her up for the next level and can't wait what skills she's moving on to.  There's also a food area but I've never had anything to eat there.  The bathrooms could use a little updating but it's usable. Oh yeah and summertime in 60 degree temperature-you can't beat it!

I picked their "Americanized" fare and it was quite nice.  Nice enough for me to come back and try their more authentic-sounding dishes.  I'm excited.  The food is not too salty.  I mean it's salty for sure but I wasn't downing my water like I usually do at, say, Pei Wei's.    The combination portion is quite generous.  Both my husband and I had some leftover and it was plenty of food to make one more meal (and a generous portion at that!)  So I definitely recommend their broccoli beef and tofu with veggies in brown sauce.  My only complaint was the fried shrimp I got for my daughter tasted like it had been fried in old oil.  It wasn't horrible but I think reaching the point where they should really change the oil out for a fresh batch.  That might've just been timing on our part.

Nice staff, nice d√©cor.    Buck stops there.  Seating is minimal though available but I can live with that.  However, the quality of the yogurt was sub-par.  My understanding of froyo is there are different grades.  The good places have the good quality yogurt.  This was not good quality yogurt and I've had my share of froyo.  The price reflected all the more expensive places we've been to so I can't even justify that "it's at least cheaper to come here."  In fact, I think it's even more expensive.  We spent close to $5 and for that price, at other locations with better yorgurt, I've gotten a lot more bang for my buck.  This is a huge disappointment for us.  We love froyo.  We know froyo.  We were hardly impressed.  I wish I could support this local establishment but I don't think we'll be coming here very often.  Plus, I overheard the cashier (owner?) talk to the next customer in line about some sort of rewards program, which was never offered to me.  I must have been a terrible customer or something.

Super nice service, delicious food, fresh ingredients.  Doesn't get any better than that.  The sandwiches are a bit on the small side but it gets the job done and fills you up pretty good, especially if you get their combo - two of a full size sandwich, half soup or half salad.

Been here a couple of times - food is pretty good!  You have to be careful though - a lot of these "healthy" places may put a lot of salt in your food.  It feels that way to me anyway so I may feel better about eating the food there but it may not necessarily be great for me.  With that said though, the salad is made quite fresh as is their sandwiches.  They also have a nice variety of desserts. Beware!  We've only had their choco covered strawberries though.  The service is great and the setup/d√©cor is nice, too.

They have a LOT of figurines.  If you have kids that love comic books, you should inquire about their good grades program (I don't know the official name of it) but essentially you get free comic books for good grades.  How awesome is that?!

From the time I started waiting in line to the time I got my latte, it took about 15 minutes. I'll chalk that up to the business just starting and need to work out the kinks. They didn't have anything I wanted as I can't have caffeine right now. The smoothies I was told is not made of real fruit (I think they use V8 fruit juice or something) so that was a little disappointing. Their frappes selection looked like maybe I could order something but there was a note on the frappe section that said they were out.  There was a long line of peeps behind me so asking a lot of questions probably wasn't ideal. Breakfast/bakery selection looked sparse.  So why the 4 stars?  Well, I did cheat by having a sip of the hub's nonfat latte and it was delicious. Hubs loved it too. The service although slow was good. Barista let me know my drink was coming up without me even asking where my order went. The decor is quite nice inside. I think there's even a kid friendly area. Lots of space to sit and relax.   I wish they had a good bakery selection so I could come here for breakfast. They make a good latte though so now when we are on the go it's nice to have a place on the way out instead of going out of the way for a good cuppa.

Finally!  Buckeye has another decent place to go eat at!  I feel bad for Subway because these subs are pretty darn awesome.  I've never heard of them before but I believe they are a chain.  Went in not really know what to expect but the employees are really nice.  They greeted us immediately and gave us a quick spiel about their food.  I'm not even much of a sub person but the hubs convinced me to try it and we both had a very enjoyable experience.  We would definitely come back again.  My only complaint was a lot of the sodas were out and seeing as I can't have any caffeine and I really wanted ginger ale, that was sort of a bummer.

Really like the food here.  I'm not even a big sub person but this place is pretty awesome.  Their lattice chips are delicious.  I keep looking for them at the grocery store but can't find it!  It's a little more expensive than other sub places like Subway but the prices are comparable to Quizno's if not slightly cheaper but better subs.

We've been coming here since my daughter was six months old.  She is now a preschooler.  The instructors there are awesome.  Very high energy and they really get to know your kids.  They don't push the students to do anything they don't want to and foster a very encouraging, positive environment.  My kid loves coming here!

For "healthy" food, this place was quite tasty!!  I'm glad we came here.  We kind of just saw this place and decided to give it a try.  I wouldn't say it's the best food we ever had but for healthy type ingredients, they did a great job at combining various flavors together to make it taste yummy.  I'd definitely give this place a try again the next time I'm in the area.

The donuts were deeee-lish!!  it's a wee-bit on the small end but it is quite the delectable treat so you don't want to indulge too much!  I don't know if it's worth the $2+ per donut but they were quite good.  The staff was nice and the coffee was strong.  Definitely worth stopping by.  It took them a while to get our order so I don't know if it's worth coming when they are super-busy.  Just a heads up!

We went with another family who got their order and we were still waiting 10 minutes later.  It seemed like they just forgot about us or something but they were quick to apologize and even gave us a couple of free cookies, which were delicious.  The sandwiches are pretty big portions in my opinion.  Next time the hubs and I will probably share one.  I wish they had half orders.  Decent service, yummy food and cute d√©cor inside.

Posting for the hubs. They had to work out first day glitches but the wait was worth it. Joe did a great job. He was very meticulous with the cut and hubs really appreciated his attention to detail. I got the chance to go in and check out the place. Really nice folks. Daughter and I were greeted with happy people and she even got a mini cupcake treat and toy. We really appreciated the service!  Hubs will definitely come back again.  Very friendly folks who know how to cut hair!

This place is like a big food court and each business has it's own specialty food.  Its got a great vibe and the food here is amazing.  If I lived in the area I would come here all the time to eat.  The food is fresh and delicious.  I believe it is also a venue so check out their hours before coming here so you won't be disappointed!

Delicious.  I didn't know about this gem but I'm glad we found it!  The shrimp and grits was delectable.  I love it when shrimps are ginormous and taste like lobster.  The fried pig ears was yummy.  It kind of tasted like pork rinds.  Definitely something to share.  I'd love to come back here again!

I never had a hot-off-the-belt glazed donut until today so I really didn't know what the fuss was about.  Now i know what the fuss is about.  I'm still a Shipley Donut's fan (Texas chain) but their glazed is pretty damn good.  The ones already out though, meh, it's all right.    My ice coffee wasn't made correctly but the folks working there were really nice.  They were just super busy so I didn't feel like going back.  We were greeted warmly and they were very patient with my indecisive 4  year old.  I would definitely come back.

Husband really liked it and would give it a solid four.  I thought it was good and would give it a solid 3+ so I rounded up.  Very small dining area but there is also patio seating.  Very  nice people working there.  Simple menu and you can put your own toppings on the tacos.  Toppings were pretty delicious.  What lacked a little was the meat - the shrimp taco and fish taco both came out fried.  I guess I read the menu too quickly and didn't notice ... which is fine but the fried food tasted like it has been frying in oil that should've been switched out a while ago.  If most of your food is fried, I think the oil should be changed out frequently.  With that said though, the fish and the shrimp taco both tasted good and nothing tasted "fishy" so we were good to go.  Finally, they are very generous with their cheese on the cheese quesadilla.    We would definitely come back and try again.

I'm not a huge fan of burgers and fried foods but I have to say, their cheese curds are pretty darn good ... and their custard ice cream is heavenly!!    Good service, patriotic decor, and they do a great job keeping the place clean.  Definitely a nice place for a treat!
