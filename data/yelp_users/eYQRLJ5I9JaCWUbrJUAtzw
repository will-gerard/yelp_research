I was pretty shocked at the low score people gave to Courtney Village. I guess it's a place for them to vent or maybe I'm just really lucky? I've been here about six months and it couldn't be better! The staff is very friendly and I enjoy the office being open 7 days a week to pick up packages or work service requests. The landscaping is done at least once every two weeks and the pool area is cleaned daily with trash cans emptied and chairs reorganized. I really like the dog park and bags you can find at nearly every corner and I've only run into one empty once- that's impressive! I had an issue with my disposal, submitted a ticket online and they called me the next day to schedule. Maintenance is always walking the premises which makes you feel safe and they even take the time to say hi and get to know you. The staff throws monthly events to get the complex involved and it makes for a good afternoon. I feel like it's a great community and id recommend it to anyone!

Unfortunately, my good luck has worn off. I recently renewed my lease with Courtney Village and I regret every minute of it. Can't wait to get out... 15 months won't come soon enough :(  I have listed the PROs and CONs- judge for yourself:  CONS: -The cost of rent is extremely high for the area -You don't have the option to opt of door to door trash service AND you have to pay for the trash compactor. This comes to a CRAZZZZZY $25 a month for trash. That's more than my water bill!!!! -$40 per animal is INSANE and they can't even keep the bags stocked for you to pick up poop -The sprinklers go off right when you get home (3:30-5:00pm rotation) so you can't even walk animals or check the mail without getting sprayed  -One of the treadmills in the gym is almost always broken -Children (I'm talking 10 year olds jumping and splashing) are always in the hot tub when you're trying to relax and there's no sign to say they can't be -The gates seem to be broken at least 2-3 times a month and they just remain open so anyone can come in -There is only one assigned parking space per apartment so there is hardly ever open spots anywhere near the buildings   PROs: -The staff really does try and be helpful when you have a question -The office is open on the weekends to pick up packages, ask questions, etc.  -They provide new air filters when you need them -Maintenance staff is super friendly -A lot of tenants have animals and I love hanging out at the dog park with them all -They have fun community events with free food  I would not recommend this place unless they fix some of the major issues listed above. Happy apartment hunting!

I understand it's hard to run a cheaper buffet efficiently while maintaining a high sanitary level. However, I was definitely let down by this location. We went on a Sunday afternoon and almost all the tables were covered in dirty dishes and food was pressed into the floors. The utensils were falling into other dishes and some of the options weren't fully stocked. The service was very quick with out table in clearing empty plates and extremely cordial. Maybe they just need more staff for a Sunday after church lets out?

We went during happy hour and sat in the bar area. The place was relatively empty and too low of lighting to see anything. I ordered a strawberry margarita which was WAY too sweet! It was half foam on top and I didn't feel like it was worth the $6 price tag. Usually when I go to mexican restaurants they bring you chips and salsa however, they had a buffet style layout with a few extra items you don't normally see. The service was great and overall a clean establishment! I wouldn't recommend for happy hour again- too many other great restaurants in the area.

I started coming here with a Groupon ($15 for 30 days) and have been more than satisfied. Despite all the sweaty people, the practice room does not smell moldy or harsh in any way. They have areas for your belongings right at the front door or cubbyholes in the locker room. The staff is extremely friendly and willing to walk you through the whole process. Make sure to arrive early and bring plenty of water and a towel!

We came here for my friends birthday and it was such a fiasco! We called ahead and stated we had 20 people and the host said we should be able to get a table no problem. Sure enough they had to scramble and find room for us outside saying they never take reservations and had no idea we were coming. The parking situation is horrible and you have to remember to get validated. I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken and the noodles just weren't cooked right. In my opinion, there are too many menu items and they should shrink it to the stuff they know they can do right! I had to add an extra star for the cheesecake though!

Great find! Massive selection and great service. They have a comfortable sitting area where you can enjoy your cigar and some good conversation. My boyfriend and I went late on a Saturday night and the employee, John, was super helpful and friendly. He took the time to explain important details and give recommendations. We were informed of their plans to remodel, add a bar area and restroom. Can't wait to visit again soon!

Basically anything you order is going to be your favorite! Don't be too sketched out by the area; it adds to the authenticity! I would recommend the chicken chimi or a basic bean and cheese burrito. Awards cover the walls of this place and you know it's good! Be sure to grab a dozen tortillas to go or some salsa by the pint.

Our party of seven came in for Father's Day to take advantage of the $39.95 four course meal with paired craft beers and it was fantastic! Making an appointment was simple and we arrived on time to get seated in a private booth with two burners. The first course was salads and most of us went with the Caesar or House which was topped with a Honey Mustard type dressing. We were then given the option of cheeses (southwestern jalapeno was definitely the best) served with veggies, chips, bread and apples. For the main course we had the endless meat option that included shrimp, filet mignon, chicken, spinach raviolis (my personal favorite) and teriyaki steak. Our waitress gave perfect directions and it's really fun to just de-stress and get to cook each bite and explore all the sauces- there was literally like 8 options! We ended with two chocolate pots served with rice crispies, pound cake, fruits, brownies, etc. Most people couldn't even finish their paired beers as it's A LOT of food and worth the price. One major downfall was the temperature. Once those pots get going and everyone is crowded around the booth it can be very hot- especially when the steam is facing directly at you. Understandably, the restaurant can't do too much, but maybe keep it a bit cooler or use suction fans to extract the heat. I'll definitely be back for happy hour and to redeem my birthday coupon for free strawberries!  P.S. Check their Facebook page for the picture they take of you and your group!

I went online to reserve a Bissell vacuum for purchase at this location. The online system wouldn't register my coupon or gift cards so I decided to use the pay in the store option. Upon arrival, I went to the merchandise pick up area where they directed me to the nearest cash register to pay- happened to be children's department on the lower level. I handed all my information to the cashier as the email and text had stated (yes, I received the email and text saying my shipment was ready for pick up) and she was unable to locate it in the system. She called a manager who search utilizing my phone number, sales order number, address, etc. After no luck and 45 min, she suggested I call the 1-800. I called the customer service line and they said there was no issue with my order then I gave the phone to the in-store employee who still couldn't figure out what happened (we are about 1 hour and 15 min by now)!! I'm starting to get VERY frustrated and the in-store lady told the on-the-phone rep to just cancel the order and she would do it in-store. Of course, it's not over then when she figures out it's more expensive in store and she can't adjust the price. She then has me sit down at a kiosk and order the same item online, again. When I got to pay she says it's easier to use a gift card so I have to go to a register and buy a gird card to swipe at a terminal?? Get this- the debit card machine won't pick up heat or pen sensors so then I have to move to the next register over (it was just something after something). Finally, that "online" order goes through and she says she'll call tot he warehouse for me to pick up. Well I get there and they have no idea what's on. I wait another 15 min and finally I get my item. I would not recommend ordering anything online from this place- just pay the few dollars and pick up the item in the store. Their system definitely does not communicate!

I took my concealed carriers permit course with J.R. as the instructor. I loved his real life examples when teaching the law section and it truly made me think about every aspect of owning a gun. The course was on special for $45 and they provided all course packages, application, finger print cards and even envelop to send off! I was surprised at how little time we spent on the range and would have enjoyed more. Ladies night is Tuesday and Friday!!

Quality Mexican food at a great price! I'd recommend sitting in the cantina area or on the patio for the best atmosphere. The bar backs up to a lake with the cutest little ducks wondering around! As with most Mexican joints, the free chips and salsa are a bonus. They have super cheap happy hour prices and often have buy one get on free entrée coupons in the mail. Never had an issue with service, but parking can be a bit of a nightmare.

Recently redone bar adds a lot to the place! They give free chips, salsa and awesome bean dip with every purchase. I'm a sucker for the pollo fundido- won't be disappointed. Being attached to the hotel is nice with all the travelers willing to chat it up around happy hour!

FUN, fun and FUN! No matter what you consider entertaining, this place will have it! One room is karaoke, another is a live band, a room for dancing and of course a bar area with general stereo music. The drinks are relatively inexpensive and the service is great. The only downfall was the tight outside patio space and having to side walk past another group for an open standing space.

Can you say EVERYTHING you NEED and MORE! They have an amazing selection of party apparel as well as gag gifts. I would shy away near Halloween as the place becomes a zoo! Don't worry about finding what you need as the staff know exactly where everything is. There is anything from sexy, themed or rental costumes available. Stop in for a good time!

Love the new loyalty program that comes with a free six wing order and $10 off every 100 points! There are a ton of wing sauces and rubs to choose from as well as a full menu with pizza and sandwiches. Almost every day of the week there is something on special- not to mention a great happy hour! I'm a big craft beer drinker and there is always something good to choose from without having to settle. The service is quick and the roomie patio offers a great place for smokers.

Locally owned restaurant with a homemade feel! They are definitely Cardinals fans with personality throughout the establishment- we sat in the John Wayne room. The menu is priced cheap compared to the large portions you get. I love how you can order lunch at breakfast and there is plenty of room so you're not elbow to elbow with the neighbor. The servers even leave small pitchers of iced tea at your table so you don't have to flag them down for a refill. I would recommend this to anyone in the area!

The restaurant section is awful. The wait was horrendous and you end up getting sat at a table meant for 8 when there is just two of you! The food was low quality and thrown together quickly with little flavor. Once the food was delivered the server was never to be found. I only gave two stars because I enjoy the meat section and the vast choices the offer back there.

Kohl's is definitely one of my go-to places for clothes shopping. They always have amazing deals and who can pass up all that Kohl's cash? I'd recommend getting their store card because the constantly send you coupons in the mail for percentages off your total. They also do in store pick up or deliver straight to your door. I think they have great styles and always an array of sizes for everyone. I'm hooked!

Love the wide range of bottled choices available for in restaurant drinking and take home options. The pizza and appetizers are enough to keep you coming back! It's a laid back atmosphere so feel free to bring a deck of cards or utilize their dart or shuffle boards. Staff is knowledgable about beer slection and can make some recommendations, if necessary.

Hands down best breakfast burritos around! The service is pretty quick and they have a nice salsa bar inside for you to fill your own containers. The weekends get a little busy with the National Guard base soldiers out to eat, but it's worth the wait! I wouldn't recommend a plain bean and cheese burrito as it's very flavorless. Parking is ample with Pepsi products on the fountain!

YUM! Great place for a hearty sandwich, fresh pizza and the best macaroni and cheese ever. When you walk in the place looks busy with all different types of pastas and sauces you can imagine. The menu is posted on the back wall along with cold cases filled with homemade sides and fresh meats and cheeses. If you're smart, call ahead and have your order ready when you arrive because the wait can be long during peak times. I love how you can grab a beer from the cooler or a bottle of wine to share on a cute date. I haven't had the chance to buy the fresh pizza dough, but will get on that pronto! Make sure to get their stamp card (spend $5 and get a stamp) for some future savings- trust me you'll be back!

Who doesn't love baseball?! The stadium itself is always clean, even the bathrooms, and looks inviting. The prices are relatively low for concessions compared to other stadiums. I love the option to hit the Diamond Club for free with any ticket purchase. Personally, I stick to Friday's Front Row for a great view, good food and friendly service.

Burger joints have been popping up everywhere making a good hamburger harder to find. This place is way over priced for just a basic burger ($12) with no sides. My boyfriend got their specialty and it was nothing too fantastic. I got the tuna and the bread overpowered the rest of the sandwiches. We shared the fries basket and had two sodas with a $39 total. Way too much to spend on a burger and fries in my opinion! I saw they had a sushi bar which just seemed out of place. I'm not sure this place knows exactly what they want to be either.

Asian and Mexican- what move can I say? I love this place and the unique dishes they serve up. I've never had a bad combination but my boyfriend got sick once so we haven't went back. Great employees who will explain how to order and even give samples! The best part is you get a snickerdoodle with every meal.

Definitely use your GPS since this place is a little tucked away by the hotel. The happy hour prices are amazing ($3-$5 drinks and $5 apps) and service is great. They have a ton of TVs both inside and on the patio. I wasn't a huge fan of the cheese that came with the pretzels, very watery, but the buffalo dip is good. It's big enough for a large group of friends yet still small enough it's not overwhelming.

Almost gave a five star, but the service seemed to get worse and worse as the meal went on. Cozy, authentic Mexican restaurant with a large menu for anyone's taste buds! I ate the carne asada burrito and added guacamole and sour cream while my boyfriend had the cheese enchiladas. I would stray away from adding sour cream because it made the burrito a little too "wet"- totally my fault. The enchiladas come with cotija cheese rather than the Americanized version! I'd recommend getting your soda from the glass bottle rather than the can- so yummy.

One of the best dog parks in Arizona! There are three separate areas for individual needs i.e. small dogs, active dogs, etc. The parking lot always has space available and it's easy to find right off Hayden. Each area is cleaner than most parks I've been to and they always have bag dispensers filled. The park is closed for maintenance twice a week (active area is Tuesday and Friday from 9-noon, I believe). Your dog will love this place!

I'm all about the new recliner seat movie theatres! This AMC was recently upgraded so we decided to give it a go and was definitely disappointed. Likely due to the extreme heat, all patrons were helped inside at the kiosks rather than outside at the normal ticket stand. However, there was zero coordination and people were cutting without realizing and many customers needed assistance using the machines. After much wasted time, we stood in line for popcorn as we stepped all over candy wrappers, straws and more dropped popcorn. Not really enjoying the experience thus far we headed to our seats. As soon as I sat down I could tell it was going to be uncomfortably hot. On this particular day it was 120 degrees outside and probably 82 degrees inside. It made our fun date out of the heat drag on as a musty sweat smell lingered in the theatre. Definitely check out the other AMC locations such as Stapley or Mill Ave for a better experience.

I always start off with the cilantro-jalapeno hummus... you won't regret it! If you're ok with a few extra calories, ask for the Greek pita bread; it's a little thicker and melts in your mouth. I'd recommend the California wrap with a side salad. The portion is rather large so share with a friend or be prepared for leftovers. They have a decent beer selection and great munchies during happy hour. If you can, snag a seat outside and enjoy the great Arizona weather.

Great dog park with three seperate areas including a small obstacle course on one side! It definitely gets muddy near the water but that's expected. Not a ton of shade so go early during the summer. I would recommend bringing a dog dish from home for the water hose since it's hit and miss on extra bowls. Never had an issue and there is always parking and restroom facilities for us humans! This is a MUST DO if your dog likes to swim or play catch in the water!

Love their healthy menu options and hefty portions. I would recommend the California Club for breakfast or the Tuna Sandwich for lunch! They do a nice twist on all the entrees like adding pesto or honey sauce. Be sure you have plenty of time because they are always packed. If attempting the drive thru make sure you come at it from the South so you can get in line from the street. Customer service is great and will come out to your car to order to make the line move faster.

This place is great for breakfast or lunch! They have huge portions for the price and so many options. My boyfriend said it's probably the best chicken fried steak we have found yet. Beware of the giant biscuits and gravy meal- a half order is enough. Decor makes you feel liek your at grandma's house and service is always superb!

Great customer service and quick install! My boyfriend needed two new tires after a flat and this place delivered for a mere $75. You can view all the tire prices and serial numbers online so you come prepared. Tip: be sure to ask about the manufacture dates! In Arizona the heat is what ruins that rubber so try and get something at least less than 4 years old if you must go with a used tire. The shop is in a sketchy area but the inside is decent with cameras, vending machines and books for your use. I'd recommend to anyone wanting a cheap used tire to get them through!

One of the busier Zipp's locations I've been too and I can see why! Service is spectacular and the restaurant is always clean despite all the crowds. Their happy hour is on point from 3-7pm which features drink and food specials. They also have a reverse happy hour that changes daily and a weekend 11-4pm menu. The food is what you'd except from a bar, but really I go for the decent draft list and zipparitas (limit 3!). I'm disappointed they don't also leave the TouchTunes box on because I already have the credits and they are interchangeable- boo!

The servers behind the counter are rude and move too fast for a first timer! Everything seemed drenched in sauce and I hated that the iced tea was only available behind the counter and I couldn't fill/refill myself. I liked the quick melt oven similar to Quiznos but I wouldn't recommend to a friend.

My five stars is geared more towards the Watering Hole and hot food stands. The happy hour is great and they have approximately 35 beers on tap! I love how you can grab a table, not too busy, and stroll over to a line for food. There are plenty of options for all people in your group. It sounds weird but give it a try for happy hour.

I've heard good things about this place and it always seems busy when I visit Tempe Marketplace. I just don't get it? They do give you free edamame and a 15% discount for showing your student ID but that's about all they have going for them. We ordered the Vegas (my usual staple) and the seaweed wrap was thick and hard to chew. Our other rolls seemed to have a mushy- not sticky- rice texture. The service was a bit slow and our waiter seemed out of it. Overall, we have spent less at sushi places for better quality. It's worth the 2 mile drive to SakeBombers!

I found a dog over the weekend and brought it to University Animal Hospital to check for a chip. The staff was extremely helpful throughout the whole process and gave me a new leash to keep him under control. Luckily, the dog had a chip and they called the owner and gave me the address where I could take the dog. Unfortunately, the owner didn't want the dog but the Animal Hospital was nice enough to hold onto him for three days while a foster was being set up. They truly went out of their way to save and life and it's greatly appreciated!

My boyfriend and I went there for breakfast one weekend and were unimpressed. The parking was terrible and service just OK. I ordered the eggs benedict which had the sweetest hollandise sauce and my boyfriend said IHOPs chicken fried steak was better. The server never came back to fill up our drinks and just dropped off the check to never be seen again (pay upfront). Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

The sushi doesn't seem as flavorful and fresh as expected. Inside is a little cramped with the center bar area being too large to yell to friends on the opposite side. The happy hour food was meh but they sure don't skimp on the sake! I'd say better places for sushi and atmosphere.

I'm normally not a BBQ fan but when I have the craving this is definitely the place that hits the spot! I enjoy their $8 regular sandwiches with an unlimited side. YES- UNLIMITED side! I normally like the mac and cheese or sweet potato fries but there is a lot to choose from. The decor is great with witty signs and the choice of a huge booth or longer tables. They work great with big groups and the service is always wonderful. Make sure to get a punch card!

I'd recommend this to anyone who is up for a sake bomber or two!

Unlimited French fries and strawberry freckled lemonade will always keep me coming back for more! This location recently remodeled bringing a more hip and trendy feel to the restaurant along with table side appetizer, drink and dessert ordering on little computer screens. The new technology doesn't take away from the customer service though which is a challenge in itself! I always stick with the chicken bruschetta sandwich that has a delicious tangy sauce all over. The happy hour is worth it (3-6 and 8-close) with plenty of drinks and appetizers to chose from. Definitely give this place a try when you're resting up from all the shopping!

My sister and I frequent Orient Sushi on the regular! They have great prices and friendly service. I really enjoy how their menu describes every roll unlike some restaurants that keep you guessing! They have happy hour pricing all day long and even offer an all you can eat sushi menu. Personally, I've never had it but if you can eat I highly recommend it!

All of their bread is freshly baked and you even get a free loaf if you check in on Four Square! I love the variety of food and I'm a sucker for their spicy potato mash. I've never been for happy hour but they seem to have great beers on tap from the posters all around.

Flavorful Mexican at a decent price, what more could you want! I normally stick with the carne asada taco plate on flour tortillas which comes with a hefty side of rice and beans ($8). I attempted a chicken taco at one point and the juice's seeped through the tortilla in no time making it very hard to eat! The salsa is medium and definitely has a kick so shoot for the guacamole if you don't do well with spicy. At the register there is a loyalty sign up machine which offers freebies for each check in (1st time is a free drink). I haven't had a chance to try the hotdog stand out front, but I'll surely be back!

Fresh, fast and authentic Greek cuisine! I highly recommend the greek salad and add gyro meat ($10). Their meat is slow cooked all day and freshly shaved upon ordering. It comes with two dipping sauces for a nice variety! The service is wonderful and staff is extremely friendly. The parking can be annoying around lunch time with such a tight area- try pakring by the Walmart and walking over.

Delicious! I normally frequent Nando's for their lunch specials with coworkers. The Pollo Fundido is absolutely amazing, but you can't go wrong with anything there. The chips and salsa are on par- I'd recommend mixing the two for the best flavor. My coworker normally gets the taco salad with ground beef and it's evident they use fresh ingredients. All the portions are very large so come hungry!

I am a fast-pass member and pay $16 per month for unlimited washes. The line is never too bad unless you get a person who joins the wrong line and clogs it all up! Each wash comes with a scented toilette to wash your dash board and a fragrance pad (Cherry or Blue Ocean) to top it off. I had to dock a star for how crowded the vacuums are. The company allows for anyone to utilize the service but it causes extremely long lines for the people that did end up paying!

If you've never had the joy of ordering your fries animal style, you're just not living! They can be a little messy so plan on dining in or waiting till you get home. The burgers are always on par and I recommend adding the extra raw onion. The milkshakes are wonderful, but can be very filling. Beware of the wait time as everything is made when you order it- definitely not a grab and go type!

The pineapple mimosas are pretty darn amazing! My issue was with the food. I got the breakfast sandwich which was pretty pricey for just the sandwich and no side. There was WAY too much egg and the bacon seemed low quality. When I arrived for brunch there was no hostess to be found, yet the sign said wait to be seated. I waited around for a few minutes then had a seat at the bar. The service was friendly but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

What a gem! Amazing beer selection with over 20 beers on draft and 100s in bottles. Really unique selection you wouldn't find on tap at restaurants. The service is extremely friendly and will direct you to try beers based on your favorite style. Games in the corner and the occasional deliver guy from Thai Basil next door makes this the perfect stop for beer! Happy hour goes till 7 weekdays and all day Sunday which is $1 off draft beers.

Love the friendly, laid back atmosphere. Bring some friends and play a game of Cards Against Humanity or Darts! The beer is always on par and variety seems to be growing at a rapid pace. The place gets busy at night so arrive early. There is no food available but feel free to munch on the popcorn or order in some pizza!

If you have not tried threading you are definitely missing out! I had been waxing my eyebrows and upper lip for several years before I made the switch. It's so much more gentle on your skin and way more precise! The first time feels a little funny, but you get used to it! All the techs are great and ensure you like their work before leaving. You can check in on Yelp for a discount on your first visit or go to their website for their weekly deals. Be sure to make an appointment for the whole process to go quickly!

Totally impressed throughout the whole process! I purchased a Groupon for Divine for $52 which included a cut, shampoo, partial highlight, and blow dry. I called and was able to make a same day appointment. When I walked in I filled out some paperwork and my stylist, Kristin, took me back right away. We discussed what I wanted in detail and she got started. In a quick 2 hours it was everything I wanted and more! Kristin walked through every step and inputted all my preference for my next visit. The receptionist gave me coupons towards my next visit and scheduled me, hassle free. I will definitely be back and most importantly be sending friends that way- we all know how hard it is to find a reliable and experienced hair salon with reasonable prices!

I am normally a HUGE fan of Subway, but I was super disappointed after I strolled into this location for a breakfast sandwich last Sunday morning. I get there and it takes forever for an employee to even acknowledge me (she was busy putting knives away under the vegetable trays). I then asked for an egg white flat bread with ham and cheese. Guess what- the toaster oven was broken! I then asked for avocado on my sandwich but they had not pulled it out yet and there was none they could give me. I said ok and continued down the line giving my vegetable choices while being interrupted by the other employee talking about how they needed to call the manager. Then the employee got all frustrated when the night shift didn't refill the bags. I don't go to Subway to listen to the companies issues- I won't be back again.

Really good hand washed service for a decent price. Definitely sign up for their reward card and get 5% back each time- it's like free money! I love how their outside area is covered so it's not as hot in the AZ heat and you can watch every minute of your wash. Usually car washes aren't very stocked with random car goodies (no one needs these anyways) but they seem to have them all!

Waiting soooo long even after a 30 minute quote. Paid additional to get the interior washed and leather treated and HIGHLY unsatisfied. When I got my keys there was still dirt on my floor boards and mats were crooked and not snapped back in! I can do a way better job at a self vacuum facility!

Definitely a loyal customer! The nail tech's do great work and are always up to date on the latest nail trends. They have plenty of pedicure chairs and can easily squeeze you in for a last minute appointment. The prices are reasonable for all services and they even have a punch card for $5 off after 10 visits! I did dock a star for their manicure bar. It's a tight area and the barstools aren't too comfortable for an hour ordeal when getting a fill.

My friends and I utilized Park Avenue for a wedding and could not have been happier! Everyone's hair and makeup turned out beautifully. They timed everything perfectly so we were not stressed and had ample time to get ready back at the venue. The staff also allowed us to bring in mimosas and supplied all the glassware. The service is really what puts this place in the five star range! Side note- Rhianon completed makeup and hair for the bride and she LOVED it!

The inevitable emissions test, bleh. However, I must say this location goes out of their way to make it less painful. You can check the wait times on line ahead of time so you can plan the best time to... wait? Even with four-five cars ahead of me I only waited about 5 minutes. They have a two car system in each lane so it's goes much quicker than you'd think! The service team is helpful and tells you exactly what to do i.e. turn off your car, what you owe, where to sit, etc. This is one of the best locations by far.

Best place for a quick sandwich lunch without sacrificing the flavor! My favorite is the engineer with added hot sauce from the 30 bottle display. I do wish they wouldn't hound for donations so much though when you're at the register. I mean rounding up is enough to donate each time- do I really need to donate more for a sticker on the wall or a used pickle bucket? STOP ASKING in THREE different ways, it just makes me feel bad or look bad when I say no.

Nasty, nasty, nasty! We got delivery awhile back and not only did it take forever but the food was horrid. The enchilada sauce was super thin with NO flavor at all. Don't get me started on the beans with way too much salt and chunky pieces. Stay away- you have been warned!

DUELING PIANOS!! A couple friends and I went on a Friday night and had a blast! They will play songs by request and keep the night going strong. The restaurant has a decent beer selection and what seemed like a great patio- though I never went outside. I personally got the cobb salad and it was just ok; too much cheese in my opinion! My boyfriend loved his reuben and the rest of the party seemed satisfied so I'll just chaulk it up to my bad ordering! Definitely a great find in Mesa and will be sure to spread the word!

I recently visited for a free concert on the lawn (Skid Row, Autograph, and Great White) and could not have been more pleased! The staff was extremely helpful in pointing us in the right direction and the layout/ space was perfect for the show. The wristband and beer lines moved quickly with several food options available. I would definitely suggest more variety (aka craft beers or at least blue moon) to be sold outside rather than sending customers inside for better beers. However, I can't really complain about a $5 beer; other shows normally start at $10 a beer! I would advise people to bring a blanket or folding chairs if they want to sit or are planning to arrive early. We did make a walk to the casino and it's basically like every other casino- nothing special. It's a little small, but definitely cleaner than most.

If it weren't for the beautiful end product and free digital "fun" prints I would definitely give Cashman Crystals a 1- star rating. My boyfriend and I purchased the medium sized square ($69 + $10 for each face) from the kiosk inside of New York New York. We were told they were extremely busy and we needed to come back the following night to pick up our product. Much to our surprise, we arrived and our crystal still wasn't ready. The guy looked around and said it should only take a few hours and he'd check in the back. He came back out and said it was done but hadn't finished the final step which would take an additional 10 minutes. Keep in mind, we are waiting for a show to start so we don't really have time and we are staying at SLS on the other side of the strip super far from the kiosk. When the guy finally does hand us our crystal they had mistaken what we wanted printed on the stone. It should have said "Love You Always" and instead said "Love Always" he grabbed the paper and said OMG you're right, apologized and kinda just stood there. We certainly didn't have time to wait a few hours for another and were leaving the next day to drive back to Arizona. I was upset but figured oh well at least it still makes sense. Unfortunately, the bad experience didn't stop there. When I get home and unwrap the crystal one of the pegs on the light falls right off! I'm expecting higher quality from a $100 purchase than this! I emailed and requested a call from the number on the website and have yet to hear anything. Be careful what you purchase from this company!

LOVE the watermelon ale! My boyfriend and I come here for a chill hangout to play some cards, darts or fooseball. The service is great and you can sample all of their's and Sonoran's all in one place. The only serve paninis but will give you free snacks and bottled water. On Sunday's you can get a growler refill and a pint for $10, that's a steal! I'd recommend to anyone just interested in grabbing some good brews and hangin' out.

Sometimes finding a consistent place for eyebrow threading can be almost as painful as the process itself, but look no further! She does great work and is extremely flexible on schedule times. It's virtually painless and always looks great. I know Renu Skin also offers facials, waxing, etc and I'm excited to try all the other services. I would recommend to anyone!

Would not recommend this place to anyone. They have definitely gone downhill since my first visit. The happy hour beer list has been knocked down to just the normal and doesn't include craft beer options which is what I look for. The food is alright but last time I ordered the Scottish Eggs and the yolk was exteremly undercooked. The service is horrible and the hosts spend more time chatting between themselves than helping incoming customers. I felt like I was breaking up a group date just asking for table! They could do much better business being in such a prime location.

Amazing brunch deal for $10 which includes a hefty meal and your choice of a 10oz AZ brew or a Monster Mimosa! They have a fairly extensive craft beer menu and everything food related has yet to disappoint. I love how you can bring your dog, too! OHSO makes it easy with water bowls, homemade treats and enough shade/ fans outside that even an Arizona Day can't keep me and my pooch away :)

The menu is extremely limited- chicken, toast and fries. I ordered the chicken strips deal through the drive thru and was very disappointed. The chicken was ok but the fries and toast were soggy as if they had been sitting out for quite some time. When I got to the window I asked for ranch, but they only serve their Cane's sauce? Why limit my options even more... Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone.

We recently had my sister and her finances wedding shower at Postinos and it could not have gone any better! There was a bit of confusion at the beginning of the evening but it was quickly taken care of. All of the staff was extremely attentive and helpful. As expected, the bruschetta and Panini's were superb and they had a ton of wine and beer choices for the guests. The only drawback was a live acoustic band playing the whole time that we were not made aware of until the day before our event. It was rather hard to hear everyone as we played shower games but at least they weren't terrible sounding. I would definitely recommend for anyone to hold a special event there!

My coworkers and I used to frequent this place all the time, but they have definitely gone downhill quickly (maybe new management?). The food is amazing and everything is homemade which makes all the difference! We attempted to stop in for lunch on Friday, June 5th around 11:30 am and found the door locked. A lady came out and explained the cook was running late and they wouldn't open till 12:30 or so. Ok, I can get over that- stuff happens. But then we tried to go again on Thursday, June 11th and was surprised to find yet another locked door! I called the business as we couldn't see anyone in the restaurant. A lady answered and explained the owner lives far away and had to check on his other restaurant so they'd be opening late again. In my opinion, they should just change their hours and quit making me waste my time! I will definitely not be trying again.

Always a go to favorite! Ingredients are fresh and the restaurants are spick and span. The lines seem super long at first but no worries, you'll get through fast! I usually go basic with the chicken but all the choices look appetizing.

If you're in search of teppanyaki and good entertainment, look no further! I would recommend calling ahead to make a reservation as this place fills up on the weekends. Osaka is a great place to celebrate a birthday or anniversary (whoa, that birthday song) and drink a ton of saki while doing it- you'll see what I mean when you arrive! The service is amazing and the teppanyaki chefs really know their knife and food throwing skills. I normally order the chicken and shrimp combination which is about $25. It comes with soup, salad, egg fried rice, vegetables and of course the meat. It's a ton of food so come hungry! I personally love their yum yum white sauce which is served on the side of every entrée. Definitely give this place a try!

Quick, friendly and accurate service- what more could you want! The location is a bit hard to find and can be very warm in the summer as the north wall facing the sun is all glass. I won't lie, the place could use a serious paint job and new carpeting. All being cosmetic- I would still recommend it to a friend. They give discounts for students and offer a stamp card for savings.

When I tell my friends I want to meet at a grocery store for dinner and beers, I always get an awkward silence followed up with a weird look. Don't judge till you've been, trust me! The Waterhole is in the very corner of the store which features 20ish beers, about 15 wines and an abundance of cold bombers to choose from. The best part- they open at 7am and will fill growlers! You're able to walk around and shop with your beer making it a unique experience- or costly one if you're like me. If you're hungry, look no further than 15 feet away from the comfy booths. You can choose from pizza, sushi, salad bar, Mexican (nachos are a must) or their hot section which features items such as chicken and macaroni & cheese. Happy hours is from 3-7pm, but I'd recommend getting there early as it gets quite packed!

The service was helpful and super friendly! Went there for happy hour with full intentions of grabbing food as well. That quickly changed about two beers into our shared flight! Glad we didn't get two since we could barely finish the first. All the beers were extremely strong and their stout was legitimately a candy bar taste. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone even though I never tried the food. Much better breweries in the area.

I happened to be at The Arizona Center shopping for clothes and decided it would be more convenient to stop in for a gel fill and pedicure rather than drive out of my way to my normal salon. Unfortunately, I regret this decision. At first they had me sit down at a table for my fill, but they began speaking to each other in Chinese then had me move to get a pedicure with the same person (not sure what the confusion was)? The massage was just ok, nothing special, but I did enjoy the vast amount of color choices. I was most disappointed that my 2nd toe had nail polish that wiped off after 3 days and now I have a chip in my middle finger that keeps snagging on everything. If I pay to have my nails done, I expect they stay on for 1 1/2- 2 weeks. I definitely won't be going back.

Much better Greek places in the vicinity that are worth the extra few miles. The service was prompt and courteous but that only does so much if your food isn't great! I got the chicken gyro with fries. The chicken was extremely dry with little flavor and only came with a small amount of sauce. The fries seemed a bit undercooked but I did enjoy the Parmesan dusting. I may return again to give them a second chance but wouldn't recommend them to anyone.

If you're an indecisive eater or just want to try a bit of everything, then this is the place for you! Items circle around the bar area to all customers on a conveyor belt for them to grab as they please. New items get added every 3 minutes or so and they include a description card so you know what you're getting yourself into! I love how it's not just sushi and includes shrimp tempura, edamame, octopus, egg rolls, etc. so everyone can enjoy themselves. Never fear, all rolls are covered so it is sanitary. Service is prompt and if you let them know what you're in the mood for they will have the chef add it to the conveyor belt!

Great shopping for all your animal needs! They have this amazing peanut butter flavored dog ice cream my pups die for. Huge selection of toys and treats for small to large dogs. All products are a little pricey but they have a dog food loyalty program after you purchase so many bags. Defineitly take your dog in on the next trip; the staff is wonderful!

Great local pet store for all your animal's needs! They have a decent selection of dog toys, treats, food, collars, beds, etc. The prices can be a little higher than a major chain like Petco, but it's definitely worth it. My dogs love their peanut butter and honey ice cream! Be sure to sign up for the rewards club and bring the animals on an adventure- they are super dog friendly!

I recently moved to Chandler and scoured Yelp for options on a new nail salon. I tried Furama this past weekend and couldn't be more happy! They have tons of nail polish options and the wait wasn't long at all even without an appointment. The shop has about 10 pedicure chairs that seriously give the best massage ever- I've never had the bottom butt portion feel so amazing! I received the $40 option that included callus remover, hot stone, paraffin, longer massage and sea salt scrub (so basically everything) and it didn't disappoint. I went with the basic manicure with a French Tip and I loved how they moved me to an actual station. It feels like every salon now a days has you sit in the pedi chair and awkwardly turn so you can get both done quicker- totally takes away from the relaxation! I'd recommend this shop to friends and I will definitely be back soon.

Love the free chips and bean dip! The happy hour is from 3-7 with amazing deals on their food and drinks. Service is always good and the place is never too busy. It's a great place for a meal with your date or a quick drink with friends! I would recommend the pollo fundido (chimichanga with cream cheese and melted cheese) delicious! I love how they have San Tan Devils Ale on tap so youre not forced to stick with a margarita because it's a mexican joint.

One of my favorite places to meet up with a large group or bring out-of-towners! This location is attached to the Yard where customers can play corn hole or ping pong to pass the time. The food is absolutely phenomenal and there is a full bar inside or outside. The pretzels and cheese fondue is a must anytime you visit and is super cheap on happy hour too! All the entrees are delicious, but even my grandma can't stop raving about the battered fish she got. For dessert, I'd go with the monkey bread which is enough to share with the table. The had to deduct a star because the wait is soooo long a majprity of the time, they don't accept reservations, and it's mandatory valet :(

Lovely patio on Mill avenue with a great craft beer selection and interesting food. Beers run about $6 with $1 off at happy hour and burritos are around $9. You can take any burrito item and make it a taco- interesting twist. My boyfriend got the green chili pork mac and cheese and really enjoyed it. I stuck with the appetizer bean burrito which was more than enough! Ask for the free chips and salsa with purchase of a beverage. I thought it was funny that 10 taco items are strictly sold at Wednesday taco time and not the entire time? Maybe place it on a separate menu so it's not as confusing?

LOVE this stadium and the awesome energy inside! If you haven't had a chance to make it to an NFL game, I would highly recommend it. Tickets can be found for about $50 to sit in the 400 section and there isn't a bad seat anywhere. Arrive early to find good parking and tail gate to make the whole experience worth while. The concession stands have a large selection of food and beer; make sure to come hungry and thirsty!

Worst post office ever! I called looking for a package that should have been delivered and they were not even slightly helpful. The 'delivery supervisor' was exteremly rude and kept placing me on hold before letting me get my story out. When I requested to speak with a manager, he told me he was it and I'd just have to wait for my items. I know it's impossible to work with another office as delivery is based on your address but try anything before you call them!

Lovely gem tucked away in a strip mall with an amazing dog-friendly patio! All of their food is delicious has a unique twist that won't disappoint. If you plan ahead, join their email list and they'll send you a coupon for a free hummus nachos appetizer- so good! They have great prices on drinks during happy hour and offer bottomless mimosas for $18 on Saturdays and Sundays. The restaurant is decorated very cute and the service never disappoints.

My friends love this place but I don't get the hype. I do enjoy the chips and salsa variety with cheap margaritas on happy hour. However, all of their food is very pricey and quantity just isn't there. I have tried the taco plate and the meat consistency reminds me of dog food. The church presence creeps me out and the chairs are kinda uncomfortable.

Don't understand what all the fuss is about? They do have a great craft beer selection but almost everything is a 12oz pour ranging in price from $7 to $8.50 which is a bit pricey if you ask me! When we inquired about the wine about half of them weren't in stock. The fish tacos were good but nothing spectular and parking is flat out horribe. The major upside to this place was the sweet patio overlooking Indian School and the quick service. I would definitely trek the 1 mile to OHSO for a beer/ hangout if in the area again.

The La Bandida is a must have; the color is a little off but don't let that fool you! My boyfriend got the Chili Burger with Fritos and gave it a gold star as well. We were able to share the regular size fries between two people no problem. The beers were a bit pricey and came in a margarita type glass which definitely affected the taste of my watermelon ale. I'd recommend to a burger lover!

The server seemed like he was in a rush the entire time even though the place wasn't very packed. I hate the way you can't get multiple sauces (unlike native and wing stop) unless you order a massive amount. They even charge you for more ranch! We ordered nachos with our wings and they forgot to bring out the chicken. Rather than take it back and add it they just brought out a tray of chicken separately and he was to throw it on top covering up all the chips and having so sauce on the chicken. When we left the server had charged us for a Coors light we didn't have so we had to wait for the bill to be fixed. The place is over priced for wings which can be ordered anywhere. Beer selection sucks too if youre a craft beer drinker.

What a gem! They have an amazing selection of craft beers to include brands you wouldn't even find in a Total Wine or BevMo. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and can make on point recommendations based on your taste and style. I'm not a huge wine-o but they seem to also be on their game in this department! Definitely be aware of the cramped space and limited seating- not a place to meet up with more than three friends. Cannot rave enough about their long happy hour time frame and discounted beers for $3.50!

This is your one stop shop for fun! They have everything from bowling to a ropes course to laser tag all with a full bar for adults! Me and my friends went on a Saturday night and only had to wait about 20 minutes for our bowling lane ($36 an hour). Each group is given a server and the food is worth purchasing- I'd recommend the meat pizza! We also played one round of laser tag ($8 per person) and a few arcade games. It's a great place for a party or a night out with friends. I had to deduct a star though for our server. She definitely didn't want to be there and it showed.

Thought I'd never give a chain 5-stars but here it is! The server is probably what made all the difference. He was extremely knowledgeable about the craft beer selection and menu. He was always excited and made sure we had everything we needed (even too much ranch, dare I say it). We went on a Tuesday for cheap wing night and they sure don't skimp. The wings were nice and meaty and I loved being able to try all the flavors I wanted without over ordering. My group also split a pizza which came out surprisingly tasty for the cheap price. They could use a little more decorations but I will overlook that since they just opened!

Vegas hotels are always hit or miss and I'm happy to report I was extremely satisfied with my stay! My boyfriend and I stayed 3 nights over Christmas this year in the Luxury Tower, floor 12. The room was perfect size for two which included a HUGE walk in shower (dual shower heads!!) and a couch that ran along the entire back wall of the room. We never once heard our neighbors and were very impressed with the restaurants and quick room service call. The hotel is definitely north of most of the action (better than Stratosphere), so I would recommend getting a monorail pass. It's not as busy as other hotels, which is likely why we loved it so much! You weren't running into people every step you took and the staff really took time to assist in your needs. We found a great rate on a Groupon, but they recently became part of the Starwood Alliance which will guarantee lowest rates anyways. I don't recommend bringing children to this hotel though- the mirrors above the bed just goes to prove how adult this casino/hotel is (and I love it)!!

My boyfriend and I visited this brewery after some family fun in the West Valley, why else would I be so far from home?! I was very impressed by the cleaniness and hospitality of the brewey and staff. The beer list is quite impressive for such a small location and didn't disappoint. I'm usually not a big hefe fan but I loved the strawberry fields. My biggest complaint was the IPA which didn't give enough of the expected hoppy flavor. We were sure to purchase some pint glasses before we left to support this local business. Wish them all the best and success!

Special shout out to Josh Mann, large party reservation specialist, for helping our group event run seamlessly! He was even there on game to ensure all of us were satisfied. My work party was over 50 tickets sitting in the rooftop area with additional access to the lawn. Make sure to bring a blanket if you sit in the lawn or get there early if you're hoping to sit upstairs (seats go quick). Beers are around $9 which is normal and there are a ton of food options. Parking is definitely the worst, but you can park for free over in Riverview area. Also, try and buy your Cubs gear off site because it's very expensive in the team shop.

I don't get the fad? The bread is just ok and the fillings are piteful. They don't have very many veggie options to make your sub a little more hearty. The chip flavors are strictly their brand and could use more variety. It's a bit expensive, about $10 for a medium with chips and small drink, compared to it's competitors. I'd rather do firehouse and get a meaty sub then just some bread. I do have to give them props for fast service, clean restaurant and delivery!

I came for the soft opening so I added an extra star I normally wouldn't give. The beer was good but definitely unexpected flavors. I really wanted to like the imperial ipa but it was more citrus than I imagined. I liked the prices at $7 a piece though! Happy hour prices seem far as well! The food was just... Not great. The pretzel is pretty pricey for a small section and that is probably not 'beer' cheese, more like regular cheese? We also ordered the ultimate grill cheese and it could have been grilled for another two minutes or so. The decor is not modern in any way but we'll give that time!

Bottomless Mimosas from 10am-12pm on Saturday's and Sunday's for $14! This restaurant is located in the heart of Downtown Chandler with cute shops and a farmers market across the street. They serve both breakfast and lunch in the morning for a decent price and a lot of food. I went during the soccer playoffs and the servers happily turned on TVs and sound for the customer's enjoyment. I had the bacon breakfast sandwich with fruit while my boyfriend had the basic breakfast with two eggs, meat and toast. We were definitely satisfied and eager to come back over the St. Patrick's holiday. Loved the décor and money walls!

Absolutely amazing pretty much sums it up! Dare I say it, they are up there with Four Peaks and San Tan in the brewery restaurant world. I have yet to sample their brews but the selection of other crafts are on par. They allow flights of any four beers on the menu and have unique cocktail offerings for those non-beer drinkers. The food is what would really keep me coming back though... can we take a moment of silence for the best mac and cheese please?! I had the tuna sandwich while others at my table had the reuben and prime rib. Everyone was more than satisfied by the taste and healthy portions. There are a few complaints but nothing that would decrease this review from a 5, more of an FYI. The fries could use some work; they tasted more like Wendy's fries and I know they could do better judging from the rest of the food. The church pew seating was a little awkward. My knee kept hitting the end pole and it was creepy to have another couple sharing the same ledge with two conversations going at one table. Too many times someone would have to get up and the whole line of people felt the slide as they squeezed out. Overall, great experience and I will definitely be back after recommending to friends and coworkers!

Great new brewery in the East Valley! The inside is decorated well and I love how they don't have TVs- you actually have to talk to people! I would recommend getting a flight so you can try all of BRIs brews. Happy hour runs until 6 and it's $1.50 off all their beers and $1.00 off others. We got the pretzels with cheese/ mustard and the mac and cheese, add green chilies. The pretzels were a little dry, but the stone ground mustard was amazing and able to hide that! While they are still new, they are only filling growlers of their own beers on Monday and Tuesday. Definitely stop in before a movie for awesome food and great craft beers by friendly staff!

Postinos never disappoints and this location is spectacular! I love the large (dog friendly) patio out front and huge open air feel inside. They offer $5 glasses of wine and pitchers of beer before 5pm as well as a $20 deal on Monday nights which includes a bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta. They have a good menu with soups, sandwiches and salads, but they bruschetta is what you go here for! My favorites are prosciutto with fig, tomato jam, salmon with pesto and salami with pesto. I haven't tried a board I don't like ($14.50) so definitely mix it up! I'd recommend you add their email list for coupons and birthday gifts.

All the staff is super friendly and the technicians do a great job! My sister and I went on Saturday morning without an appointment and got right in. The have several options of pedicures ranging in prices from $15 to around $40 depending on your needs. I also got a manicure which around $10 and my polish lasted over a week. They offer water bottles to all their clients and have ample colors to choose from. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and will be back for sure!

Great sandwich place that's tucked away on Mill Ave! With unique menu items, there is definitely something for everyone. They even have sandwiches that include mozzarella cheese sticks layered right in! I'm a big fan of their 'normal' turkey, bacon and swiss or tuna sandwiches. The Sun Devil sauce is amazing and be sure to take advantage of the free extra add in's i.e. onion, mustard, etc. I personally order my sandwich on the sourdough, but I've heard good things about the Dutch crunch along with their normal wheat and white. I had to deduct a star because it's really hard find a parking spot in the area without having to pay to park.

One of my favorite places, hands down! Closer to my house than their other location off Bethany and even more space for your drinking needs. Happy hour goes till 8pm and is 25% off all beers. If you can dream it, they have it! Definitely give one of their grilled cheeses a try for a good meal while playing games. Service is amazing and they even remember your name... or maybe I just go too much ;-p!

AMAZING!! Such a fun experience for any age or any time of day. The prices may seem high for the hourly rate, but it's split among all players in that cell (up to 6, I think). There are several games to choose from and I would recommend the TopGolf if it's your first time; think of it like bowling. The service is great and the food is even better! The do it yourself donut holes are a must try! If you do have people in your group who choose not to participate in the golfing there is so much more to do- Xbox Kinect, Giant Jenga, Bear Ball, foosball tables, pool tables, etc. The best part is they serve great beers to wash down the experience!

If you have the option to go elsewhere i.e. lucky strike, AMF, etc. definitely don't come here. It's a little more pricey than your average bowling alley and you don't get any extra perks. We went on a Monday during the day and bowled two games each with shoe rental, two pitchers of Blue Moon and an appetizer and paid $96 without tip. The service was extremely slow (I think she was the only person besides the cook). The bathrooms were disgusting- one stall with no TP, one that had overflown with TP and urine and the other one was stained with poop along the inside. It was obvious no one had been in there all day to take care of it. However, the worst part has yet to come. There was myself and my boyfriend on one lane and a group of four at the lane next to us with the rest of the place empty besides a lady at the bar. A group of 8 screamingly excited 10 year olds come in for a birthday and guess where they put them? Next to the us- trying to have a nice day date drinking pitchers. I was so pissed we closed out and left. They probably would have made more on letting the two adult groups bowl and drink in peace rather than placing a kids birthday next to us.

Great addition to the north Scottsdale area! The restaurant is wide open with plenty of seating and great patio area. The place is still under construction as they just opened so you can't see into the brewery area yet, but looks very exciting! The food is very good and reasonably priced. HH is $1 off al their SBC brews (only one when I went) and $1 off snacks and apps. Definitely a place I'd recommend for a large group or a laid back date! Bonus: the management walked around a made friendly introductions. I would bump this to a 5 once they get the brewery kinks worked out.

We ordered through grub hub and could not be more disappointed. The order arrived almost over an hour later (taco, enchilada, burrito and supposed to be two orders of rice and beans). When the my arrived we were missing the extra order along with any utensils to eat it with. We called the restaurant and asked to speak with someone about it and they HUNG UP on us the first time. I called back and a manger with broken English told me I'd have to call grub hub to get a refund. Terrible customer service and cold food upon delivery. I wouldn't even give this place a chance, there are plenty of others of others in the area!

All beers on draft are local Arizona brews with a great selection! Happy hour is $1 off all beers and $7 pizzeletta or caprese sandwich. The Chef used to work at Pizzeria Bianco (amazing for those of you that don't know) so the pizza is a must order! The patio is a great size if you'd like to have a small party and the service is always attentive!

No wonder they had to open this THIRD location- OHSO never disappoints! This restaurant/bar is a lot larger than the others featuring a patio, partially covered, that welcomes animals and groups of people ready to play games. The food hasn't changed a bit and always satisfies- I'd recommend the Arizona Burger which has a spicy jalapeno cream cheese (yumm)! if you come during happy hour they have $3 bites to include cheese wontons and egg dip. The beer selection is definitely not lacking and they strive to have lots of local options. OHSO is a great place for any occasion (brunch, lunch, happy hour, dinner or just drinks)- give it a try!

Incredible selection of cigars and craft beers on draft will keep me coming back! The venue is quite large with comfy chairs in the center for smaller groups to longer tables off to the side for a bit more privacy. The staff will help with cigar selections based on past favorites or recommend something new. The beer selection is superb- who knew half of those came on draft?! The place is always clean and parking can be found right outside or a short walk away. Definitely give this place!

Pleasantly surprised by how many beers I liked from Goldwater! My boyfriend and I split a flight of everything except the porter and added on their newest (yet to be named) IPA. Every beer had a nice distinct flavor and the samples were quite large! The space is plenty for a small group and they have popcorn available for free. There is no food and no intention of selling food (asked the bartender) so come with a full belly or order from a restaurant nearby. Parking is kinda bad so I suggest parking at Walgreens and walking over. Definitely give this place a try!
