I hadn't ever been inside this store until I found out they were offering a class in fondant/gumpaste...  So, I am not taking a cake decorating class here and found this store to be quite the hidden gem. Most of the ingredients that I would typically buy off of the Internet, they have. Powdered dyes, FOND-X, Silpat in large sizes to accommodate the larger pieces of fondant....  They also have a huge selection of candy making supplies, cookie cutters, and other various baking necessities. Mind you, a lot of the items they have range from Wilton Brand all the way to the higher-end baking stuff. So there is a great range for beginners to professionals.  Parking is easy and there is a large lot  The staff is "somewhat" helpful - they can be a little offish, but don't let that intimidate you.  My instructor, Heather, is very talented and knowledgeable and helpful.

Wow.  This place sucks. Honestly, don't waste your time. The food is overpriced. The service is awful. I hate the parking structure. It's just a mess.  A hot mess. How are they staying open? My arnold palmer was $2.50. The tea was flavored and tasted really gross with lemonade. We split the house salad which was obviously the prepackaged spring mix from Costco (or Sysco -- whatevs)  Then we split a medium pesto, tomato, and basil pizza. The tomatoes were not ripe, the sauce was bland, and the pesto was non existent. And then the 30 pine nuts that were smashed into the cheese were overkill. The crust was fair. The server took my plate before I was finished and then set it back down after she realized my fork was in my mouth. So for two teas, a house salad, and a medium pizza our tab was $22  ??? Costco Pizza would have been better. Bleh.

Nail salons in Gilbert are a dime a dozen, but Priscilla and Tony are above average when it comes to acrylics/sculptured nails. I'm very picky when I get fills and I would rather get a backfill every time, but Priscilla and Tony understand how to make every fill look amazing. I had my nails done by both of them and they both take their and are careful about shaping and filing.  Salon is super clean, too.

I've been a customer at this location for more than four years and while I've never needed to write a negative review,  I've also never been overwhelmed to write a terribly positive review, either.   Here's the rundown and why they only get one star....  The first few years of my relationship with Nationwide Vision was good -- not great... just good. The Doctors change frequently, so it's difficult to build up any type of history, but I guess that is what a chart is for, right?   For the record, my eyesight hasn't changed much over the years with the exception of a gradual decline due to age. I am near sighted, no astigmatism, wear contacts and when in the mood I switch to my glasses, and have slight allergies due to hay fever.  All in all, I'm a pretty easy patient.  What else hasn't changed in the past 5 years? My health insurance. I've had the SAME benefits, the SAME copay, the SAME EXACT carrier since I've been a patient with Nationwide.  I basically get the same exact brand of contacts every year and can budget accordingly. However, this year I paid $50 more. I brought this to the front desk person's attention, and she insisted I was wrong...  I went home, called insurance company, verified my benefits, went back in to the store to get my refund, and she refused. I showed her - well, I actually drew her a picture, and she refunded me $25. Come to find out, she actually charged me another $25 rather than refunding me, which has caused another nightmare with my FSA carrier, but that's another story for another day.  I called the corporate office and basically got "into it" with that representative. After a solid 10 to 15 minute phone call of bantering back and forth, I gave up and decided that this was definitely a no-win situation.  If you want to just be a patient with a chart, get what you need quickly (in and out) and possibly be overcharged (with no care of fixing the situation) then feel free to go to Nationwide Vision Center.  Funny thing is, I don't mind being rushed in and out of the eye doctor. What really IRKED me was the overcharging and complacency to even help me get the situation resolved.  So, what could have been an easy fix, ( I was willing to split the difference and take the $25 and call it good), has now resulted in a disgruntled customer, a crappy YELP rating, and the loss of a five year patient...  Come 2015, I shall be looking for a new eyecare provider (Pun Intended).

Melrose Vintage is a mix between a really kitsch baby store, a hole in wall decorator spot with one of a kind antiques and hard to find fabrics, and a great scrapbook store with endless options all in one great boutique. Who knew?!  I wandered in here in search of some cute scrapbook paper for some invitations I was making. I found the store on a blog; I've been doing paper arts for years and had never heard of this store even though it's been around for quite some time.  If you like the shabby chic look, then Melrose Vintage will inspire and empower. They've decorated this place to the hilt, and just walking in here will spark creativity.  They offer classes - I used to teach paper arts, and actually have a degree in Graphic Design so I kinda know a few things - and their classes are really great. They have a lot of different options and their prices are reasonable.  Parking can be a nightmare, and you might have to be patient.  There are plenty of places to wander in within a 5-10 mile radius, so I would take advantage of the location.

IN a previous post, someone mentioned how Mayo could possibly get less than 5 stars.  I'm rolling my eyes at you.  Let's start with their completely inept administrative staff.  Not only did they completely mess my appointment up, they made no effort to fix this problem and the blame was put on me, "I'm sure you can understand," muttered one lady.I also didn't appreciate the little looks of disbelief as to why the thought of fasting for another night in preparation of lab tests might not sound so enticing, the 40- mile drive to the clinic for said tests and appointment,  and then the rearranging of one's schedule in order to accommodate their mess up?   The Dr.  Wow. I don't think I've ever had a FASTER appointment. It takes an oil change at jiffy lube longer.  He reviewed my existing lab results, looked over a few things, and then proceeded to tell me that I should be fine. NOT ONCE did he ask me how I felt, symptoms, etc. THe entire appointment took 10 minutes. I wonder how much a ten minute appointment will cost my insurance company?  NOT to mention the wayfinding in this hospital. Wayfinding is the process in which different methods are used to help those visiting your facility find their way. MAYO CLINIC has so many different levels, escalators and arrows it makes it impossible to find your way to the different levels.   MAYO is nothing but a sham.A big corporate scam that is preying on the laurels of medicare.

Eh. I had to take some firefighters who were visiting from Sedona out to eat...My choices were limited to Mill Avenue. I got to blurt out one very denied recommendation before I was overruled by 5 very hungry, very thirsty, very "away from home" boys that all wanted to go to Hooters. My big fat mouth had to say "How about  the LIbrary?" Nice. Where did that come from? Parking is fine. It's MIll. You can figure it out. I'm not even going to talk about the ambience. Most of the girls are very pretty and I'm sure would make a wonderful party favor. Intelligence does not reign supreme at "The Library" ironically enough. I asked if they had wings (because we had no menus)  and the response "I'm not sure" Guiness?  "Let me check." Can you make sure I get the tab? "What do you mean?" She kept forgetting the drink orders (There were 7 of us and she tried to remember all of them - each time we ordered rather than just WRITE them down! ) Forgot to bring us our food and well... there is just too much more to even get into.... So, sadly, I give the Library 1 star.  I doubt I'll go back. It's not my scene. I am SURE there is a niche group that likes this place, though. ???

I miss working in downtown Tempe. My boss and I would go here at LEAST once a week. I won't fail to mention that I now work within walking distance from LGO, Radio, and Chelsea's.and deluxe is only a few miles.....  The atmosphere isn't that great, and the service is spotty.... (they do offer to go)  If you go for lunch, either come early or late, don't try to hit it right at high noon, or you'll be waiting (sometimes outside) for a while.  The thai iced tea is good  Their lunch specials are well priced and come with an egg roll (which didn't ever have corn in it, but this might be something new) and usually starts off with soup or salad (i think they rotate soup/salad depending on our seasons) The pad thai is nutty and good. I REALLY wish they had a Green Mango Salad with Dried Shrimp, but...If you don't know what to eat, then try the thai basil (their signature dish); it's always a good fall back if you don't like......  THE CURRY.  The curries. Ahhh - these get their own paragraph.  I've never been a huge fan of yellow curry (don't like the potatoes...) but their red curry, sweet nut curry (which is red), and green curry are phenomenal. In a class of it's own is the green curry.  I am in love with the green curry. You can get this green curry with tofu, chicken, beef, pork, or shrimp. I usually get it with tofu or shrimp, but I've had it with chicken and pork, and both are great.  If so inclined, TOPS Liquors is located in the same plaza. They have a wonderful selection of beer..but that's a different review.

This is a solid 4-star joint. Based on the food and beer selection alone. The burgers are really, really good. It's a well seasoned and dressed with caramelized onions and arugula on a ciabatta or brioche type roll....And the gazpacho - this is one of the valley's best gazpacho's.  Considering there are 130+ reviews on this place - it strikes me odd to not see any comments about their seating and ambiance. Delux is little. At one point, they seemed to have realized how great they were doing, and smooshed every possible table,booth and chair together to try and squeeze every last possible patron.  D's ToGo (next door) is a great concept, but it seems that space could be programmed better. Utilize curbside or call ahead pickup instead of cramming us in the main area like sardines.  And although trendy and stylish, if this were anything but "Delux", we would all be yelping about their shameless exaggeration of their logo and branding. Just take a look at how many Ds you see floating around the restaurant...We get it - we're at Delux, eating Delux burgers, going to Delux bathrooms, ordering Delux beer, wiping our asses with Delux toilet paper.  It's a FUN place with GREAT beer, though.... Remember that!  Oh yea, their fries are good. Not great. And a bit overpriced... And so many people have sweet potato fries now, I wouldn't be surprised if I saw something new starting to accompany the burgers....

Oh Chelsea... I envy you. You have 54 reviews, why not one more?  Chelsea's Kitchen is located on a sort of "landmark" for me; this location (not building - just real estate) has been so many fun things over the years. I am happy that Chelsea found her home here.  The menu changes with specials and chef's delights, so one night you might find yourself eating a surf and turf and the next a really great seasonal salad.  The drinks are flowing (try the LGO) - I didn't like their beer selection, but no biggie the pitcher of LGOs made us happy.  I LOVE the fact that their menu doesn't have a million things on it....You don't need a million options. Just a few very well executed and well prepared dishes.  We started off with the nachitos - this is a meal in itself. You could share this with a few drinks and be just fine. The chicken didn't overpower the other elements and the tortilla chips are fresh and, imho, the way tortilla chips *should* taste...  This last visit, I had the short ribs. They were tender enough to cut with a fork. The over-easy egg on top was a nice addition. There were tender baby veggies on the bottom which also was nice.  We ended the meal with chocolate pecan pie with fresh vanilla bean ice cream. Nothing more to say about this other than it was fabulous.  There is a burning fire outside and inside, a nice cozy bar that's big enough to not feel like you're standing on top of your neighbor, and the staff (even management) was not pretentious or rude. They were accommodating and happy.  My only drawback is this (and it's not worth taking a star off of)This is one of those really trendy places - so if you get intimidated by that *crowd* or you just don't have the patience for *them* I would suggest going either a little later or a little earlier. But I wouldn't use this as an excuse to not go to Chelsea's.  Simply stated, this isn't a 3 star experience. This is far above 3 stars. Chelsea's continually delivers a great meal with a great atmosphere. It's not hit or miss; but it's not a hole in the wall either....

Thanks, but no thanks. This review is brought to you by one of the craftiest girls in the east valley.  I'm a pro-am pastry chef, taught scrapbooking classes, blow glass, make jewelry, paint, draw, knit, quilt, sew, decorate, and am basically just a creative chick. Oh - yea - I'm also a professional graphic designer, by trade.... So needless to say, I've frequented Michael's many a time.  Tuesday, I went to this Michael's to purchase an airbrush. It was difficult to actually find someone that knew what they were actually selling - let alone if someone had keys to the "locked up" merchandise, but after hunting someone down I finally found someone who could assist.  So, I found my airbrush -- to the lady to ring it up -- used a 40% off coupon (score) and the total (pre tax) was $97. After deciding I wanted a different airbrush, I gathered up my receipts and went to the store. After about 15 minutes, I asked the sales lady what was going on and she explained that "Company policy for the return on fine arts over one hundred dollars requires the general manager to be present and that she couldn't refund me my money." I asked her where that was posted and why that wasn't explained to me when I bought the airbrush - I also explained to her that the transaction, sans tax, was really only $97.  She then apologized one more time, and then told me that they've had a lot of problems with fake receipts and that they weren't really sure if this was a real receipt, but if I could come back tomorrow....  No offer to take my name and number to have this resolved No offer to provide me with any other alternative than to come back to the store and talk to the general manger.  When I called corporate this morning, they verified the receipt, called the store and then told me I could return it as they have validated that it was a legitimate purchase.  I then called the store manager to find out if I needed her to be there for the return, and in her kindest and most trained voice she said, "NO honey, just bring it in.'  I then tried to explain to her exactly what customer service is, how cost of poor quality affects the bottom line (even if the poor quality is subjective like customer service) , and how by not listening to the voice of the customer, not only has she done a disservice to that Michael's tore, but to the actual Michael's brand. And no lie, she laughed at me.  So for all you crafty chicks out there, a new Hobby Lobby opened on Greenfield and Baseline (but they aren't open on Sundays).  Arizona Art Supply is on Southern and McClintock for your fine arts needs. The fiber factory and tempe yarn are both in the east valley if you knit. Scrapology is on Lindsay and Chandler Boulevard if you scrapbook. If you prefer to make jewelry, then the best bead store in the world is on Priest and Southern (and it's not wholesale),if you are into soap and soap making I would suggest going to Sprouts. Frames are always a bargain at Target or Aaaron Brother's. For flower arrangements and bows, go to  Joanne's. . If you like RC and models, there is a hobby shop on chandler boulevard and Gilbert, as well as Gilbert and baseline, and there is a pretty cool hobby store on Val vista and Elliot.   And finally, as far as  all the other kitschy stuff Michael's peddles, you can find it at the dollar store. The Dollar Store always has a ton of fun things to do - and there is a dollar store located at chandler boulevard and Val vista on the southwest corner.  I have officially boycotted Michael's.

Yea. this place rocks. It's fun - food is great - it's a WONDERFUL place to take out of towners, business cohorts, and friends.  The food is just superb. The service CAN BE spotty - but I wouldn't knock them down a star just for that. It just rocks.

I kind of wavered on whether I should write a review about Zipps - my reasoning was based on #1 it's a sports bar and #2,well, it's a sports bar. But I did review The Library..... and after thinking about it, I seem to have a lot to say. I've been here several times, and this latest bout was a 3 to 4 star experience. So, I'm giving it a 4 star based on other sports bars in Gilbert. Zipps doesn't have anything to write home about. It's a sports bar with a LOT of TVs, 2 pool tables, a shuffleboard table, a few video games, and one of those stuffed animal machines.  There is a patio for the smokers, a dining area for the family or large group that want to come here and eat a meal, and a bar area for the drinkers and smaller social groups, and die hard fans that want to be up close and personal with their team of choice.  There was only one game on (STEELERS vs. Chargers) so we didn't have to worry about positioning ourselves correctly. However, there have been times when we didn't show up for gameday in a prompt manner and were forced to crank our necks to catch our game (even though they do have a zillion tvs). It gets pretty busy in here and once the crowd starts shuffling in, it seems as though the wait staff starts to forget things, the bartenders get sloppy, and the kitchen backs up. This place has been opened long enough to understand proper expediting and timing. Right? The food is, well - ok. It's bar food, after all; I had to keep reminding myself I didn't come here for a crudo of sea scallops with vanilla salt or a braised duck breast.  They do have a generous selection and there were a *few* specials. $1 off a large pizza or $8 specialty burgers. I did appreciate the selection of burgers which can be ordered in either beef, chicken, turkey or garden. They have flatbreads (which I didn't really like), a few specialty salads, and some sandwiches.  On this visit, we ordered the Chicken Fresca sandwich which was basically a chicken breast with pepperjack cheese, some sort of Jalapeno sauce, salsa, and a bun. It was good, but the bun was soggy and the lettuce was wilted and lifeless. I would order it again, and just eat the chicken because it was perfectly grilled and the salsa was a nice compliment to go with the pepper jack.  They have a good selection of beer. However, I opted for a citron lemonade (*I must keep reminding myself I'm"m at a sports bar) and I literally got vodka and lemonade (and it was the kind of lemonade out of a bar spigot - not true bar lemonade). I suppose I was expecting a teakwoods tommy lemonade (mmmmm those are the best)  Our server was gracious enough to realize that we were probably going to sit at that pub table for quite some time, and didn't try to move us out. She kept our party somewhat happy and she was prompt with our tab.  So it is what it is. It's Zipps. It's fun. I'll probably go back (It seems like I always do). But there are a LOT of sports bars out in GIlbert to choose from.

Dear god, If I ever have to go to an ER again, please take me someplace other than Gilbert mercy. Please take me somewhere the Physician Assistants are not total douchebags and the nurses don't take 35 minutes to get paperwork. Please find me a hospital that understands my fear of needles and deep anxiety Toward the Dr. Profession in general. Please take me anywhere but here, sincerely  Gabi m.

After reading the reviews for this restaurant, I was a bit skeptical to try this location. Additionally, I had never been to a Grimaldi's. So, going into this dining experience, I had already set the bar rather high for the food  and the bar rather low for the service.  I was excited when we didn't have to wait for a table. We were a party of two and they sat us right in front of the kitchen. We had a great view of everything in the restaurant and were not crowded or cramped one bit.  The surrounding and ambiance is pretty corporate. It kind of looks like a few notches above NYPD Pizza. Red checkered tablecloths (although not vinyl), white linen napkins, subway signs etc.  The service was great - we were greeted within 2 minutes and we had a thorough explanation of the menu (which is limited to pizza, salad, and desserts).  We ordered a medium (or whatever is between large and personal) pizza with Italian sausage and sweet roasted red bell peppers, a small house salad to split, a beer for him and a syrah for me...(the wine list is a little corporate - but there are some god finds for the $$)  Our server was very cognizant of taking our plates when were finished with the salad (and even knew NOT to take away his plate until i was finished) and when our pizza came out (perfectly timed after salad) the runner served our first pieces (and asked to do so)  The manager, Deron, stopped by to make sure everything was going great - and you could tell was genuinely concerned about how our meal was going thus far.  Our server offered us dessert - didn't push out when she noticed we hadn't finished our drinks - and then was paid and went home (Canoli in hand)  The food was GREAT. The pizza was perfect (to my tastes - I'm NOT a Chicago pizza fan), the salad wasn't drenched in dressing and the dressing that was accompanying the perfectly torn lettuce was the perfect mixture of oil and vinegar. Let me tell you this seems to be a huge problem in Phoenix - Phoenix restaurants seem to have a huge issue with understanding ratios of vinegar to oil.  At any rate, the canoli was excellent - and although I've had much different presentations, this was one was awesome.  I love Friday night dinner/date night. It's the perfect ending to a tough week (which i just had) and I hate when it's spoiled with bad service and bad food. I would and will definitely return to Grimaldi's on a Friday night.

Where to begin. SERVICE: We were a little late to The going away party we were attending. When we did arrive and finally seated, we weren't offered any of the sparkling wine the rest of the table was drinking. When we finally asked for glasses, we waited...and waited...and waited... I wanted to get my order in so that we could get our food with the rest of the party.  This shouldn't have been a big deal; I ordered the rockfish, for my date and I to split, and then some lobster bisque, since I'd heard rave reviews (on here) that this was the way to go as far as soups. We had a party of 12, and while this can sometimes be a daunting task, there wasn't much maintenance to our table.  We had the same bottle of Cava for the entire table and then each person was drinking water.  The bisque came at the same time as  the other appetizers, but he tried to take it away before I was done (pet peeve!). There was a lot left, so there shouldn't have been a question as to whether or not I had finished.  Dinner came and went. I requested a wine list, but the server asked me after I had finished the entree if I wanted any wine. Desserts, which are made by Tracy Dempsey, were never offered. The guest check was a disaster! I think they needed an abacus to figure out how to split it. We only wanted it split three ways. Not difficult. It took 25 minutes and three tries. FOOD This could end up being a four page write up. So I'll try to keep it short. The fact that I'm in the industry shouldn't deter me from trying new restaurants. But, I was surprisingly underwhelmed with the creativity. And I would regret it If I failed to mention the lack of seasoning, I also despise SPLIT PLATE fees unless you split the plate for me, but when I'm doing all the work - don't you dare charge me 5 dollars.  The rockfish portion could have been - and I'm being generous here - 4 ounces. I'd be surprised if it was a four ounce portion. It was four small bites. So, $25 and four bites later.... And the lobster bisque...no. Under seasoned, thin, and over creamed. At least finish it off with some sherry and I also wouldn't mind a reminder that I'm eating lobster. AMBIENCE whatever. It was dark.  The bathrooms are pretty and clean.  I am sorry our party of twelve spent more than 60 a head at this establishment.

I've been looking for a yoga studio in Gilbert that catered to hot yoga, and I found it!  The studio is clean and well laid out. They have a variety of yoga swag if you are looking for a new mat or towel. And while the classes are sometimes packed, the instructors are helpful with all levels. Parking is ok, they are located in a Safeway shopping center so there are plenty of spaces.  The studio also offers classes throughout the day catering to early morning and evening clients. They offer a $20. 2-week special for first-time clients. Their pricing is a bit high, but after trying to find a good hot yoga studio in Gilbert that was clean and accessible, it's worth it.

I like the food, the attitudes of the staff, the décor and the prices. Their crepes are light and fluffy and the fact that they serve fontina cheese is a plus for me. Thank you very much.

It's breakfast food. If you can't get breakfast food right, then you should not be in the culinary world. Granted, making a French omelette, or poaching the perfect egg can be challenging, but it's literally one of the first things you learn in culinary school. But, being a short-order cook sucks. And I've been to OverEasy enough to say that the service is always on par with a good breakfast joint and their food always comes out on time and accurate. Even at their busiest times (which seems to be around 9-10 on a Saturday/Sunday), they are pleasant and the food is reliable. I will say this - their coffee is outstanding. And they don't complain when you ask for a cup to go.  It's not HEART coffee, but it's damn good.

Just had an amazing breakfast burrito. Tortilla was fresh, eggs were seasoned, and the salsa was SPICY! Good value, too. If you're looking for flavorful Mexican food, that is inexpensive a quick - this is your place.

I made an appointment to get my eyes checked at the SanTan location. Mary, the Customer Service representative, was extremely helpful. I had made an initial appointment and then rescheduled it for later in the day. I wrote down 2:45.   I got to the store to check in at 2:38 and the lady behind the counter told me (in a not so very kind way) that my appointment was at 2:30 and the Doctor wouldn't be able to see me.  However, she could reschedule my appointment for tomorrow.  Regardless of the obvious disconnect between the original CSR and myself, I find it hard to believe that a service-oriented company dismisses a potential client after 8 minutes.   I certainly don't know anything about Visionworks internal policies, but I do know a thing or two about customer service. Not allowing any type of contingency for a client is an interesting business methodology - I suppose it's quantity over quality?  Fortunately, I will NEVER go to Visionworks.  During my lunch hour I was able to get this accomplished:  Driving to appointment Missing appointment by 8 minutes Driving home from appointment Write an email Posting an amazingly descriptive review on Yelp Calling my Eye-insurance provider to express my adoration for Visionworks and finally schedule an appointment with another provider to provide me the necessary Glasses, Sunglasses, and Contacts i need to see for the next year.  And look it's only 3:12!  I suppose I'll take the three minutes I have left and eat my lunch.
