They do quality, professional work, with a fast turnaround and exceptional customer service. Larry hand delivered an order to me and it was a 25 minute drive from their office. Exceptional customer service and they get the job done right with no hassle.

Fantastic quality and customer service. I have nothing but great things to say about Spa Lamar, and it's my "go-to" place for massages. I fully recommend them for a quality and well-valued massage. It's worth it. Great location just north of Fashion Square. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. They will explain everything, especially if it is your first massage.

Very good Mexican food. I recommend their Chimichanga. The only gripe I have with the restaurant is that their menu seems to be rather limited to enchiladas, burritos, fajitas and tacos. The patio is an authentic experience. I strongly recommend visiting Frank & Lupe's in Old Town.

I've been to Defalco's a handful of times before with average customer service, and above average southwestern Italian food. However, tonight, I ordered a soup, they were out of. The cashier refused to make more of the soup of the day. After waiting 10-15 minutes to hear the news, he offered a dinner salad. The salad was not fresh and the lettuce was unsatisfactory, after waiting an additional 10 minutes. I went up to the counter and spoke to the owner. He offered to give me another salad, which at that point I didn't want to wait any longer. He finally gave me cash back, after giving me some of the worst customer service experience I've received at any restaurant in Arizona.  The worst part is that he would NOT listen to me when I told him the lettuce tasted stale and out of date. He outright denied my claim. I have not received such an attitude toward a customer before. He had no reason to give me a snarky, self-righteous attitude. He acted completely full of himself and his restaurant, saying that it was fresh and I was wrong. It's not that hard to please the customer. I will not return and can't recommend this restaurant based on their refusal to put the customer first. I'm pretty sure I know how a fresh salad should taste and this was not up to par. Not a big deal, don't attack the customer. That's unacceptable. There are a number of Italian restaurants I frequent in Tempe and Scottsdale and will go to them in the future. Defalco's inability to give a welcoming and positive experience is not well received and will not be tolerated.

The service here makes you feel at home. They are extremely warm and inviting and remember most of their customers. They make you feel special and happy to have you a customer. That alone makes me come back -- not enough places these days truly put customer relationships first.   I usually get their house special chicken, which is a fried chicken with amazing seasonings. Everything here is pretty tasty - you can't go wrong. Their vegetarian egg rolls are delicious. Everything is extremely affordable, especially if you order a lunch or dinner special.  Little Szechuan is a family-owned small business and it is a great part of the Tempe community. You'll enjoy your experience!

Great food and atmosphere. My go-to Italian restaurant in the valley. I've ordered a little bit of everything over the handful of times I've visited. Romantic atmosphere as well. Great place with live music, wine, etc. I recommend this restaurant without a blink of an eye. Staff is pleasing. No complaints! The bread tastes amazing too.

Don't bother with this place. Management is rude and doesn't understand that although they may have thousands of residents, each one matters. They had a paying future customer and lost one because they couldn't pick up the phone and provide basic customer service. Do not bother with this place and its joke of a management team. Their operation is terribly disorganized and doesn't care about the value of each of its residents.

I've been going here for two years now. Best cut around, with fantastic prices. They're all great people, friendly and always ready to strike up a conversation. This is the barber shop to be at. Highly recommended.

Field Kitchen threw away everything good Sweet Tomatoes had to offer. Don't bother wasting your time -- increased pricing, charges for every little thing. Not worth it. Terrible business idea. Families -- no longer free ice cream for kids. Incredibly disappointed and will not return. You can only go up to the salad bar once now, even if you don't order a la carte. Seems like they were trying to lower food costs and destroyed their core business in transition.
