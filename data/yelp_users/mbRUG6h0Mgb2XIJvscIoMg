One of my fav restaurants of all time. I dare you to find better food & better service somewhere. Try the off-menu chicken tenders.

Got the green chile burrito. I don't love refried beans. This is loaded with them. Still good tho. All diff cultures here. That's cool.

Me likey. Call me cheap (hey, we are on a budget)(isn't everyone?). But I like the walk-up counter (ala Pei Wei) that has good food and a good environment. This has all of those. Creativity and quality oozes from all of Joe's spots. The menu is constantly changing. The environment is relaxing. And the coffee is taken very seriously. :) Check out each of the different themed bathrooms.   My wife and I usually split a salad and either a pizza or even a sloppy joe. Then coffee and dessert. If you like bbq, that's right across the street at Joe's BBQ. This is one of our fav date spots.

Poor guy that was waiting on tables was by himself the day their Groupon went live. He currently has 9 tables for lunch. We'll see how the food is....  It was really good. Chicken fried steak. Yum.

Not a great start for a brand new franchise. I've been in 4 or 5 times since they opened a month ago. Each time I'm there, at least one customer walks out pissed. 10-15 min wait for prepared food (hash brown, etc). For at least 5 mins one day, there was no one manning the registers with 6 of us in line. I really want to like this place as it's clean, well-designed, and cheaper than Sbux. Oh, & good wifi. Hopefully, they will read a few of these reviews and make adjustments.

They've upped their game. Usual order - Pan Pizza and Boneless Chicken. Love the Pizza Tracker, too. Oh, and it's usually here in less than 20 mins. Very consistent service.

As good as the original Libby's El Rey Cafe in Globe, AZ. Libby's daughter, Marisa, is using the same homemade recipes tested since 1947. If you've been through Globe, you should know Libby's. Now, East Valley'ites have a chance to try. The complimentary tortilla chips they bring out are called "butter chips", and you will find out why. But don't fill up on them. Guac was not out of can. Everything is homemade. I had the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada Style. I shouldn't have finished it all. But I did. Go check 'em out!

Marisa will take care of you! A true mom & pop place. Run by the daughter of the original Libby's El Rey Cafe in Globe since 1947.

Not the fastest. Feels like they need 2 more staff each shift. Parking lot/drive thru is a mess.

This is going to be trouble for me. I love the boba. They have a great variety...everything from frappacino like drinks to coffee to juice/smoothie-ish.
