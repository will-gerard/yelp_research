I don't know what I am doing writing a review for this store that no one (at least no one with any ability to change anything there) will ever read.  Nevertheless, I came, I saw, I left empty handed as nothing (in truth, not one little thing) in my entire basket rang up as it was marked on the shelf.  I don't know if it is incompetence, stupidity, or a laudable "I don't give a flying f" attitude that makes this the worst Michaels in the area, but I am not sure I have the time to devote to studying the subject matter.    I think my favorite part of today's experience was when the third item rang up wrong and I told the cashier, she said "oh" and looked blindly like a deer in headlights. No "I'll check on that for you," no "do you still want it," just a blank stare.    Sadly, I'll be back next week because this is the closest one when I am out and about.  But seriously, as soon as I find an acceptable online substitute, I am outta here.

Went to pick up a bouquet for my sister in law. As I was getting my son out of the car, he runs for a corvette parked a few spots over (a seriously rad looking one too). The owner comes out screaming "you can't park here" and tells us to leave. I suppose he thought we were headed to the bar next door. I was about to tell him we were there to buy flowers, but he was so rude we just left instead.

Wondering if the two pair deal is too good to be true?  It is.    I went in on a Thursday afternoon.  Two people were working and there was only one other customer in the store.  One employee greeted me and then returned to he desk to play on his cell phone.  I shopped for about a half hour trying on frames and finally left because no one would help me.    The moral of the story: no one will help you if you are standing by the $79 frames.

We are regulars at this location.  I love the staff (Michelle is incredible) as is just about everyone else. Yes, they microwave eggs, but they microwave real eggs (not the nasty egg food stuff) and everything there is always so fresh. As a bonus, they are very sweet to children and dogs.

Yep. A five star review.  This place is exactly what I was looking for in a gym.  It is inexpensive without being cheap. No contracts.  Great classes. Very clean.  The childcare is very good.   If I could change anything it would be:  -the dumbass airpark drivers who wont let you make a left-hand turn out of the place -more yoga classes -their yelp page that says "not good for children." Are you kidding? The child care is the reason I found Gold's to begin with.

I think this place is now called "dragonfly teas." But whatever the name, this place is exceptional. Everyone is so nice (even to children) and the tea selection is great. The tea is as good (if not better) than Teavana, but half to a quarter of the price. Be sure to try Lemon Love Affair...  Its Orgasmic!

I wish I could tell you how the food was. We were sat on a Sunday afternoon around two, and after twenty minutes of not seeing our waitress, we left.

Okay care, but horrendous billing practices.  Both my children were seen in January, but Phoenix Children's didn't get correct information to my insurance company till July.  When I called to make sure my account was paid in full, they told me it was, but then proceeded to bill me for months afterward.  It took seven calls to the billing department and the issue is still not resolved.
