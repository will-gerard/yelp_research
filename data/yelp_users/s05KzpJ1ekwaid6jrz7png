This is the absolute worst bank location I've ever been to. There's always one teller, two if you're really lucky, but the line is almost always 4 people long. The one time I asked to speak to someone about closing an account I was told it would be a 20 minute wait, even though there was no line and I watched multiple employees sitting around fiddling on their phones. I even saw someone on Facebook. If this wasn't the only location close to me, I would NEVER EVER come here. It's despicable how poorly this location is run.

Stay golden Taco Bell. You guys are always great.  I come here all hours of the day and night and I always get quality. And the drunks are hilarious.
