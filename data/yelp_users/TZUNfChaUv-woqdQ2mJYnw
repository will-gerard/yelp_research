This was not the same place I remembered as a teen in California. Menu was completely different and has a bad attempt of being like a subway. On a good note the bread was fresh, but sadly I won't hit it up again.

Been coming here for a few months now and finally got a pedi and I am going to keep coming back. Have not been disappointed once. Love how they keep doing the set up in the place, makes me feel like I'm stepping into a new salon each time.

Well I finally learned my lesson. DO NOT GO TO TJIS LOCATION EVER AGAIN!!!!! How effing hard is it to add an extra scoop of green chili to the cheddar green chili quesadilla. EVERY TIME! This time it came dry. Enough said.

I ate here yesterday was ok.  So ok I'm going back today. I had the Brutwurst dog combo, yum! Today I'll be having the chicken sandwich. I like the casual setup, liked when I walked in the place it was filled with men ....lol! Keep you posted.

Always good food, good lunch menu, reasonable prices, sitting in the bar is perfect, tv, drinks fast service. And the bartender makes a great bloody Mary it's the perfect cure for a hangover.

Nice atmosphere, has an enclosed patio, the buffet is good, reasonable prices. Will return. But some of the enchilada dishes are a bit runny but still good.

I've been going to Carlos O'Brien's for a few years now and love this place. Started with the location on Northern and now the one in Scottsdale/Phoenix area. I have never been disappointed with this place. Great food, service and bar selection is good.

Always love watching the fight at this place, good atmosphere. Can't give a food rating, didn't eat. But I sure hope they have good food now that it's under new management.

Went at the busy hour of lunch, they were on their game in and out of the drive thru in less than 10min. Love the chicken wrap with spicy sauce and love the waffle fries.

Love, love this place. Friendly staff, great food, reasonable prices. The Thai Basil Fried Rice, chicken lo mein and chicken egg roll can't be beat. My favorite Chinese place.

I wasn't sure about this place at first but it was yummy. The prices were decent and they had a steady steam of people coming in. I for sure will be going back there.

My first time there and like it a lot, went for lunch. It was a bit pricey but worth it and the beer was nice and cold. It was hot only because I sat in the patio bar but there are mister outside. I'm definitely going back and for checking out the night seen.

The atmosphere was great, this place use to be a bird sanctuary, the kept the birds when the turned it into a pub & bar. I love all the trees and birds. They have a roof top you can sit and drink, the food was really good and everything comes with tater tots. Prices are good for the portions. I'm going back and I recommend it.

This place opened 1/21/14 been watching them construct the place, was excited to go there.........it SUCKS!!!! Fox10 news lied big when the had these people on to promote, they should be a shamed of them selves to tell people to go there  when they tasted the horrible food. All my dishes (which is a la cart) tasted like fish, inside smelled like fish. So I sat outside. I has a chicken taco, pork taco, both had no flavor and they give it to you in 1 tortilla.....hello street tacos come double stacked, had the Columbian rice, is was crunchy jasmine rice with lemon squeezed on top, the salsa was bad also had no flavor either. Nothing had flavor. My friend had the fish taco and said it was nasty. They give you a 40.oz empty bottle of beer filled with water (tap I'm sure). And the service sucked, waiter asked if we wanted our checks and forgot. The lunch crowd was gone. I had to get up and going inside and tell the guy "did you forget us". I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!! Lucky I gave them 1 star, guess I had 2 eat it, pissed I did and paid for it.
