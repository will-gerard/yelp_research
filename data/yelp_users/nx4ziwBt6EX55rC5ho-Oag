I've been there 3-4 times and have found the food to be excellent on each visit. Lady owner is warm & welcoming... Lunch there today was quite good and reasonably priced. .. Place is a bit worn but food & service are excellent... I will go back for future visits.

Love Pho Chandler! I've been a customer for about 4 years - especially like Pho, curry chicken, spring rolls, and green beans. Service is friendly and fast - prices are reasonable... I'm a regular..

Love Yogurtland ... have been going there since it opened a few years ago... people are very friendly and have gotten to know Wendell over the years... I am a teacher and send all my students to Yogurtland... great spot with the best yogurt in town! ... super friendly management, too...

Been going to PJ for quite a number of years (usually Chandler/Dobson & Ray) ... so glad to have found this PJ today when I was shopping in this area.  Great ambiance - sat at the bar and the service was friendly ... food was great and warm out of the kitchen.  Grilled chicken with plain and cilantro/jalapeno hummus - and iced tea (always love the tropical tea at PJ).  I look forward to returning to this location when I'm on the north side of Phx.  5 stars!

Just had a smoothie here and it was very tasty - berry berry. I did notice that the store is not very clean, though. Restroom was not clean and the floor of the establishment was not clean. That makes me think that the kitchen area may need some attention also. May give it another try in the future.

Had high expectations after reading the reviews but those were not even close to being met. Cashier said that breakfast sandwich could be made into a wrap - I ordered Morning Glory as a wrap, with bacon & spinach - It would've been kind if she'd have mentioned the upcharge for the "upgrade" to a wrap ($1.25+) and the ($.50+) additional charge for adding a bit of spinach. $12.05 for this wrap & a small coffee felt like a gouge! ... Then the coffee took at least 10 minutes and the breakfast wrap took forever! And it arrived without bacon on it--aargh! .. Then my niece spotted a dead bug under our table... The wrap was of good quality but no flavor and the coffee was okay... The bacon that was given to me on the side upon pointing out their error on the wrap, was good and crispy - would've been nice inside the wrap but I was too hungry to wait any longer.. I eat many meals out (daily) and live pretty near this place but don't think I'll be returning.
