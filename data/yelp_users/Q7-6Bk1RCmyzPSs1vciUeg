Chicken strips, Chicken soft tacos, and Arnold palmers. I was satisfied and the service was good for being packed. They have great music videos playing and sports all round.

Very pleased with Sheila and how she educated me on auto policies. She showed true knowledge on coverage and gave great "if" examples. One great attribute was not pushing me towards a AAA policy but to attain the best policy for me. She briefly talked about her history at AAA and made me feel comfortable that I was in good hands. From a late night online quote to her contacting me the following day, I was able to get everything answered and attain a policy in one phone call.   I never walked into this location nor any others, who knows if i will ever meet her face to face. For one agent to emotionally touch a prospective customer that much in just one phone call, is very impressive and that is why she deserves every bit of this shout out. I highly recommend Sheila.  * I accidently posted this on the auto repair shop location.

Every Friday I am here with the company. This place is always freaking good. By far best bar-food - always consistent.

Becoming more like a walmart with larger selections and apparel. Frys grocery quality always wins.

Great burritos, their plates are now like a sit down restaurant. Sturdy plates and with a well set up

This place has a lot to offer. Nothing better than bringing the dog on a Sunday afternoon. Duck and people watching on some nice grass.

Great takeout service. I love when flames come off the woks.  Cooks back there know how to cook fast. Love it

Been coming here to this location for well over 3 years. I lack on a consistent regimen but I can guarantee a hair cut once every 8-12 weeks. I've seen employees come and go but overall they have some of the most down to earth people working here. I get a simple four on the sides with a bit of length on top for a casual spiked look, so I'm only there for 20 minutes tops. In the short period of time, the staff shows pride in their location. Sweeping, organizing and keeping conversations alive to us patrons.   There is a hair salon tailored for a more expensive crowd across the parking lot. I choose this location for pricing, promptness, and more casual ambience. If I recall right, my one haircut there was about  3 supercut haircuts. For my simple haircut I prefer a faster service here at Supercuts. They always do a great job and their staff is always friendly. Keep up the good work.

Great spot to get away from the city. Patio seating is comfortable during sunset. They have great wine pairing recommendations too.

Have an issue with keeping chai in stock. Great place for students to do work with the free WiFi. I personally like the food served here. It's a cozy spot to get out of the heat. They sell ground coffee too.

I enjoy this place ever time. I haven't ventured off from my order, I always get their gold wings and french fries. The place is great for watching games and be prepared to wait a little longer than usual due to being really busy. Overall this place has satisfied and left me full.

Barista didn't know what an iced dirty Chai was. He looked grumpy coming out from the back and was not welcoming at all. Expected more from a coffeehouse that has been here for many years.

Seems to be always overwhelmed with orders and workers scrambling frantically.  My sub always comes out good so that's what keeps me coming back. You would think making a sub with everything infront of you would be "freaky fast" but not at all.

This place is a burger joint that backs up what they are in their amazing burgers. They are delicious, mouth watering and big burgers. I was hooked on the first visit and will continue to go.

First time - deluxe pita with chicken and berry blast smoothie. I'm not a fan of pita chips that comes with the burrito. But both items I ordered were great.

Great location, right in the center of a once was safeway parking lot. They have great patio and indoor seating. Can't wait to hold a SEO meeting in their glass room. The family has their favorite items here.
