Sky Harbor Airport was clearly built before 9/11 security measures were put in place because hopping between concourses isn't very efficient.  We had a connecting flight at PHX on our trip to San Francisco and our hour-plus layover gave us plenty of time to grab lunch.  We decided on pizza at La Grande Orange in Concourse D.    There was a security checkpoint at the end of Concourse A and I figured one of the TSA agents could steer us there.  One of them told us that Concourse D was on the other side of the airport so we needed to follow the moving platforms there.  We walked 10 minutes' worth of moving sidewalks--traveling east, south, and then west--before we got to Concourse D.  Then I happened to glance to my right and saw the back of the TSA agent's head.  It was the same lady who had given us directions there.  She was standing in the same spot 10-15 yards away.    She made it sound like the two concourses were in totally separate parts of the airport when they were literally right across from each other.  Because there's a security checkpoint between the two, you can't just make the 15 second walk from A to D.  Instead you have to take the time wasting A-B-C-D route.  Sky Harbor is ok if you can find something to eat on your own concourse or if it's your final destination.  The places we tried during our layovers exceeded our expectations of airport food.  But for making travelers take such a roundabout path to get through the concourse alphabet...2 stars.

Last month I attended a conference at the Charlotte Convention Center.  As we left for lunch we exited the building onto MLK Street.  There was an employee of the CCC posted up outside to help direct foot traffic.    "Can I help you with something?" "We're looking for somewhere to eat." "What kind of food y'all have in mind?" (Shrugs) "It doesn't matter...just something good." (No hesitation) "Lola's then.  It's right down on the corner." "Um, ok.  What's Lola's?" "Southern, soul foo--" "Sold!  Say no more.  Thanks!"  I took off down the street with a smile on my face.  I love soul food and Lola's didn't disappoint.  When we got there about 15-20 people were in line ahead of us.  However, by the time made it through and sat down with our food the line snaked out the door.  I'm not certain if it's always that packed or if it was just convention center volume.  In any case, I really enjoyed my meal.  I opted for fried chicken, collard greens, macaroni & cheese, cornbread, teamonade (Arnold Palmer to most), and a chocolate chip cookie.  I'm one of those people who pick the skin off fried chicken and since all skinless fried chicken tastes exactly the same...I have no opinion about the chicken.  I will say that my skin-eating tablemate said it was the bomb.  She rolled her eyes back into her head as she said it.  The greens were seasoned really well (they had a slight peppery kick) and the macaroni was tasty too with a cheesy, baked crust on top.    It was one of those times when I didn't really have space in my stomach for all the food but it was so delicious that I couldn't stop eating it.  As I went along I shifted a bit in my seat, trying to open up side compartments in my stomach to make it work.  I'm guessing that's why they serve everything in takeaway containers because they know they're giving you a lot of food.  I had to wrap up the cookie for later.  I waddled out of Lola's feeling like I'd want to make it a weekly thing if I lived in Charlotte.  It's a solid soul food pick.

So I guess I do like Mexican food...Blancos was really good!    We stood in their fast food line, called Blancos on the Fly, to pick up quick bites during our layover.  The line almost spilled out into the terminal but it moved quickly.  The menu options at the walkup line were limited to:  Chips & Guacamole  3 Cheese Quesadillas (made of Oaxaca, Asadero and Manchego cheeses with an option to add chicken or machaca beef for an extra $2)  Three burrito options (made with black beans, cilantro rice Mexican cheese and pico) ---Carnitas Burrito (braised pork with tomatillo and green chiles) ---Chicken Burrito (slow roasted chicken with caramelized onion and peppers) ---Machaca Burrito (braised short rib beef with tomato and green onion)  My quesadilla was simple but delicious...loaded with tender chicken and gooey cheeses.  The chicken was slightly spicy and so moist that a dribble of juice ran out when I took a bite.  It was much more flavorful than cardboard quesadillas I've had in the past.  The thing was huge too--cut into four pizza sized slices that barely fit the takeout container.    The boy ordered a fat burrito that was packed with chicken.  I didn't taste it but apparently it was so good that he wouldn't put it down so I could snap a photo.  He did mention that one side of the burrito was cold and the other was warm. Not sure how that could be avoided when you're wrapping cooked foods with fresh ones.  It certainly didn't stop him from demolishing the wrap in record time.  I hesitated to stop at Blancos but I'm glad we did.  Lunch was filling and bursting with flavor.  They make it easy to grab a tasty lunch and still get to your gate on time.

Lah Grand Orange?  Lah Gran-day Orange?  Lah Grann Or-hange?  I still don't know how to pronounce this place but whatever.  LGO it is.  The point is that I totally didn't expect to find pizza of this caliber at an airport.    Yelp said there was pizza here and that's all I needed to know to make the (loooong) walk from Concourse A to Concourse D.  I figured it would be one of those places where you point to a pre-made slice (sunning under a heat lamp for who knows how long) and wait for them to reheat it in the oven.    Instead there was a guy behind the counter flinging crusts with flour all over his apron.  They did have a display of pre-made pizzas but since they were out of cheese, they made our pizza fresh to order.  It took about ten minutes for it to come out.  It was a thin crust pie...nice and cheesy without being oily.  I got a stack of napkins to blot oil off the top but didn't even need to use them.  There were tiny chunks of tomato in the sauce and the sourdough crust had a satisfying crunch.  The pie was large enough for us to split but only because we were saving room for gelato.   The Mint Chunck (their spelling, not mine) was delicious too.  I was expecting a mint toothpaste flavor but instead it was earthy.  Bits of real mint were mixed in with broken slabs of chocolate (stracciatella style) and it was surprisingly good.  Again...not what I expected in an airport.    My only complaint about LGO was the lack of seating.  They had a cute caf√© area out front but every seat was taken...too many of them by people who weren't even eating...reading newspapers, typing away on laptops, watching phone videos.  Fortunately, there were two open seats at one table and the people sitting there invited us to join them.    That aside, it was an enjoyable meal.  We'll be back to LGO on our way back through.  If we can find a place to sit next time, I will bump to five stars.
