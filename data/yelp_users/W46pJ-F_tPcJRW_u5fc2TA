I'll skip the traditional lions and tigers and bears oh my! And get right down to it. We are a family of 2 adults and 3 kiddos. 9.12.and 14. Finding something reasonable to do all day isn't easy to do. Animals are something we can all agree on. I got something in the mail for a membership for the zoo, probably because I am one for Az Science Center and Botanical Gardens too. Anyway this was $179 for 4 kids and 2 adults... For the year! That's a great day. One of those pay a day and get the year for free. We packed lunch and brought water bottles and what a great day for it. No junk food, tons of exercise, family time, learning...the petting zoo was awesome. Fantastic job Phx Zoo bravo. The lions and flamingos were hilarious...the zebras were impeccable. Oh, but the elephant??? Not ok. They need to do something with Ruby!!! I'm serious! Outside of her nothing was depressing but she was...and I'm an elephant fan. Oh and no pandas no tigers??? Come on now... Everything else suburb. 4 stars.

I got my Yorkie's shots done here while in town. I waited too long thus 4 stars not 5, but they were great otherwise. It was economical, they seem to truly care, very friendly and good at what they do. Nice facility, they let me use the restroom. Everything is clean and organized. Funny cat in the front office.

Always super helpful. Country atmosphere not corporate. I get my organic chicken feed from a co-op now but every time I run out or need anything in between they are always awesome! They even offered to order my kangaroo food for me! Shelby and his dad are great guys, awesome staff.

Thank you first off, for existing!!! Right between our office and home is this AMAZING place!!! Furthermore for having all licensed herbalists on staff who actually know and care about what they do. I was in there with a friend and co worker today and loved loved loved Valerie!!! What an amazing woman, person...herbalist and employee or rather business partner I assume, correct me if I'm wrong maybe she wasn't in which case you should MAKE her part owner of the company! Teas, powders, droppers with everything you need! One thing we needed was out she put my friend right on the waiting list. Spent so much time with us, still satisfying other customers. A.MAZ.ING! Thank you!

Terrible customer service. Had a return, with a debit card that no longer existed. Manager told me he was the store manager. He wasn't. Then the real store manager came and told me it wasn't their problem. He would issue the credit and the bank could send me a check. So what if I paid cash? Oh then we could only give you a Best Buy gift card. BULL! Can't be legal. Total BS. This store has poor management because they are in high end Chandler so they will get sales no matter what so corporate doesn't make changes. Don't waste your time. Go on amazon and let Tony Esposito go work at Burger King where he belongs. Bad attitude, bad review.

This doctor, staff and hygienist are AMAZING! I can't NOT write a review!!! I am so impressed by how they do EVERYTHING here! And believe me I despise the dentist! I signed my spouse up for the end of the month as well! Stop going anywhere but here (that's my opinion!)!

Just had it out with the pharmacist, who I can't even believe passed pharmacy school.  We came about 9pm right after my surgery. I am in a rental car so I am the only one who can drive it, so even though I had emergency surgery, I still had to drive. Anyway we went through the drive through. We came close to 10 so the pharmacist who by the way looks Chubacca, (so you'll know her when you see her!) had a bad attitude from the get. Anyway I was given 3 prescriptions which needed to be filled, this meaning WORK for her big lazy ass! She slowly and RUDELY took my info, then told me it would be 30 minutes. At least that was pretty quick, so I said ok and preceded to return some texts and emails in the drive through while waiting, with no one behind me of course. She told me (ever MORE RUDELY) that I couldn't sit there, I needed to "Move along now!" and she Shoo-ed me away with her spastic hand motions...HOW RUDE! So I finished what I was doing, maybe 3 seconds, hunted for the gear shifter in the rental, that took a another second or 2, then, I can barely move my legs due to the surgery so pressing the gas took me a couple more too, so I am sure I looked like a smart ass to Pharmacist Elnas AKA Chubacca, and clearly yes... I am quite the smartass, but I wasn't being I was just in INTENSE PAIN!  Hello people don't usually end up in the pharmacy at their best right? Which means they should have be pretty damn good by now at customer service when working there, No!??  Anyway she then RUDELY told me how she wasn't going to fill my prescription now.  "I don't like you so that is my right."  She said. YOUR RIGHT? You don't like ME? Not my attitude, not my pain or even my seemingly smart ass too slow for even your slow ass movement...but you don't like ME, CHUBACCA?  "I have done nothing wrong, what are you talking about, I am in PAIN!" I exclaimed! She said, "Great so take a walk on in the store then and I'll fill it in here.  I said, "I can't walk lady, I just got out of emergency surgery!"  "Not my problem, there is another CVS down the street." She said, and she waddled away.  That is when I flipped. I laid on the horn until she returned, asked for her name and license. Told her she was going to lose her job, at some point after she told me she wasn't going to fill it I started recording video of which I played a portion of for so could see herself and how she was acting. MIRACULOUSLY she apologized.  "Please don't complain." she said,  "I'll give you a gift card!" She said.  "I'll fill your prescription."  "Sorry it's just store policy."  Hmmm that attitude you just watched your self give on tape, is that CVS store policy too? Funny what people start to offer when they see what their boss and the Arizona State Board of Pharmaceutical Licensing will see. Not to mention the attitude, the customer service and the blatant disregard for human well being & discrimination for the half crippled blonde with a doctors recommendation for pills because she just rolled off the surgery table! AHHHHHH.  Whatever she rectified it. I got a $25 gift card to go with my now higher blood pressure. Still, it that was my grandma she was treating like that? Or yours. Or some other sore half crippled person in pain, or bad health or sickness. I just wouldn't want to have not done my part. I'm still going to complain... 1. To you, fellow Yelpers!  2. To her boss 3. To corporate CVS 4. To the Arizona State Board of Pharmacy So good luck Pharmacist Elnas Chubacca, may your days in some other industry be plenty and bright! And may your days of wanting to be fat and lazy because your shift is almost over, and when someone doesn't accept your happy little  "I went to pharmacy school and now I work at CVS" power trip...be few and far between.  STOP BEING RUDE to people who don't want to be there in the first place, when you are the one getting paid, WELL, to be there filling little bottles, when you probably don't want to be either. There are too many other people who need good jobs!  I will never go back to the Chubacca CVS. Not even to use my $25 gift card. I will take her advice and go to the one down the street. And when I stop for gas? I hope she is the attendant behind the counter serving up slurpees, oh wait, with that attitude, she doesn't even deserve that position. Take your over paid $70,000 salary spring for some customer service classes you RUDE girl.  See, I can be mean too! But I didn't call you Chubacca once! I was probably TOO nice to you which is why I needed to get all this out.  People just DON'T send your prescriptions, your family or friends...let alone your hard earned dollars to this store or pharmacy. Unless you are looking for bribes for dealing with Chubacca, after all RUDE jerks need jobs too right? Attitude is everything folks. Ah ha! I feel much better, thanks Yelp!

HUGO is a complete idiot. They have a $35 plan which he knew nothing about, had to call his manager then instead of listening to what I wanted proceeded to talk his way right out of a customer. Prior to that he told me my phone was broken because the battery was dead, I charged it and he was astonished that it worked. He then told me it wasn't comparable With TMobiles system. It's a Tmobile phone but sure you idiot, you don't even know how to charge it let alone what's comparable with what! Idiot. My advice? Use another store or carrier all together. As for you Tim the manager?? FIRE HUGO, as I said... He's an idiot.

Poor service, long wait...no one cares about the customers. Basic chain. I've been to others all over the country. Don't waste your time at this one! My husband said and I quote, "I'd rather go to chilis" and we don't go there.

Not some where I would usually have gone but that's to Yelp I went. And I am sure glad I did! We went for business lunch and it was an absolute blast. Totally fair pricing, tonssssss of food great great place! Eat inside or out.

Spoke to Eva the VIP host and she was great! Mike from the front desk was also EXTREMELY friendly and helpful while we spoke 4 times!!! He was very patient with me!!! We are having a birthday party there at the end of the month, and they have been absolutely great! They have live music in the lobby pretty much nightly at 9. The sushi Roku restaurant is in the hotel and they have their own page but it's great too.

Chili rellano was delicious. I asked for one with breakfast and they did it for me. Breakfast was great! Our server Cassie was amazing, and I was a server so I mean GOOD! They asked to make the 5 year old with us a smoothie or ice creme! FREE. Chips and Salsa were good, atmosphere was fun, full bar, kid and family friendly. Clean clean restrooms and restaurant. Free samples of microbrew beer! Yum yum yum! Under $50 for 4 people for brunch, huh? Oh but I left a $20 tip! Grrrrreat.

Now open for breakfast on Sunday for football. They play all the UFC fights at this bar, games...tons of outdoor seating and indoor pool tables, darts, shuffle board! They have great wings, burgers, lunch, dinner, they have these awesome things called pig wings that will change your life! Lol. Also you can get your car washed while you watch football on Sunday's! They have a service there that is awesome! I took my truck last week and it's still clean. The staff is super friendly and helpful, the bar tender Letti outside was quick and really sweet, and their bouncers are fun too. The owner was walking around greeting customers too, seemed like he knew a lot of the regulars...very legit sports bar and grill. Oh! And they have a late night food menu!

I can't imagine this place having a bad review. The owners are a husband and wife dynamic duo who just pampered my entire family and took care of all our eyelash, manicure, pedicure, gel, spa, acrylic, and fill needs! I just moved here from LA and I am picky!!! I mean it, we ARE a high maintenance posse! Even my 5 year old sister got kids nails done. They have 3D nail art, full sets, mani pedi specials designs...everything! Just like home. I have been to 10 other nail salons in the area and this is by far the best. Even good brow and facial waxing. What a GREAT business not to mention some of the nicest people I have ever met!

Positive experience. Got something small like a birthday party? Something mid range like a car show or festival? Or even something large scale like a free style moto show or charity event? This company has done it all! For sure the best option in town and beyond.

I really enjoy off road stores. This is a booming business and a beautiful location. REALLY close to my house... BUT, I guarantee this place won't last long. Their service department is HORRIBLE. They claim to changes tires free. They don't list "limitations" on kids bikes. Then they tell you the reason is because they are a pain in the ass. Well why else wouldn't I do it myself? Hello! So they decide to do it since their sign doesn't say limitations...AND because it's the right thing to do...and they tell me to pick it up at the end of the day. Like it takes 20 min. Just not good customer service. Bad attitude, bad service.

Great food, great service. VERY filling huge portions. Free refills on drinks. Friendly staff. Daily specials. Great for taking someone out to lunch. Not the easiest to find so I called. They are next to Dollar Tree. Happy to answer all questions.
