Came in on a Saturday with two hours until an event and was in need of a dress shirt. Neil greeted me right away, measured me accurately and with a bit of discussion on my fit and style preferences he had several great selections laid out for me. I was very impressed with the fit, quality and selection of the clothing and ended up buying a second shirt just because. I will be back as frequently as I can as I loved the amazing service and knowledgable staff. Thanks for taking great care of me, see you soon!

The entrance was the #1 impressive thing about this place, as it is completely a surprise and almost shocks you.  I won't give it up here but it's worth at least getting a drink to experience that part.  Greeter was great.  Lounge singer was very 70s and campy, but liked him none the less.   Food is pretty below average in pretty much every way possible.  Bread they bring out is pretty bad and dries out within minutes of being at the table to the point it's inedible.  Salads were small, boring and WAY drowned in dressing.  Calamari is $15 or so, and is half the size of what they'd give you at Capitol Grille, and is pretty bland and mushy.  the pasta tasted as though it were cooked in rancid water.  the chef was nice enough to come out and bring my wife a personalized dish that he eats, and it tasted the same.  we smiled and pretended to enjoy it just to keep from looking like big complainers.  We literally don't complain usually, but her first dish was inedible.  My lasagna was decent, but nothing spectacular and the sauce was too sweet (but that's a matter of taste, so i digress.)  Desert: It was spectacular.  Try the tiramisu, it is the best I've ever had.  Canolis were great too.  Loved it.  Our server was new, and he told us as such, so he was pretty clueless overall, but very nice as well.  Bus boys were very attentive.  Service overall was above average but the food was just so mediocre I can't think of a reason to talk myself into visiting again.  If you go, get a drink, maybe an app, and head somewhere else for a good italian dinner.  For God's sake, Maggianos (a chain) kills this place at the same price point.  You're better of there or Macaroni Grill truthfully.

Let me preface this with:  If I could give less stars I would.   My teenage son had a booking to ride from Kingman, AZ to Phoenix, AZ yesterday. I prepaid and purchased his ticket online weeks ago. We got to the bus station early and we were told he couldn't ride without a notarized letter stating he could. NOWHERE on the site did I find this info, he couldn't board, and his trip was delayed a day.   Fast forward to today. We get to the depot at noon, which is 45 min early. Bus isn't there at 12:45 so we start calling the main office in Vegas. The idiot of a girl there answers the phone as if it's her own personal phone, doesn't even introduce herself or the company. We ask where the bus is and she puts us on hold for literally 11:30 minutes. I hang up, call back, and between her giggles she half-assed answers the phone.  After 5 minutes of holding she says "the bus will be there at 2:10."  I asked why the bus is 90 minutes late and she just repeats herself.   We go home to burn some time after sitting at the depot for an hour, and come back at 1:55 and the bus is already there waiting.  The riders all look upset and the driver gets out and explains what's going on. Evidently the girl at the depot in Vegas never told him my son was on the manifest for today, so he drove through Kingman without stopping and was an hour past kingman on the way to Phoenix when she radioed and told him to come back for my son. You can imagine the anger of the passengers, all of which is now directed at my teenage son whom is - at this exact moment - riding for 3 1/2 hours to Phoenix with a bunch of angry strangers that are two hours later getting to their destination.   FUCK YOU!  Sincerely,  Jason
