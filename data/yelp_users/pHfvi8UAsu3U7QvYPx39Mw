I had dinner at Caffe Boa this past Wednesday. Amazing atmosphere and vibe, very classy and elegant.  We had the Salsiccia Contadina as an appetizer and it was delicious. Very large portion for a starter.  For our entres we had the Chicken special. Good but no overly impressive. We also had the Voodoo Penne. The Penne was absolutely phenomenal.   I was very impressed with the service, Bethany was great. I will surely return soon and recommend you do as well.

We had the pleasure of dining here Wednesday night for a birthday dinner. The outside does not due the place justice. The interior is well decorated and has a great ambiance. The service was great, our waiter was very attentive and they removed plates very promptly.   Regarding the eats, the rainbow chips and chipotle salsa was really good. I had the chorizo stuffed chicken and it was very flavorful. We also had the seafood quesadilla and the lobster enchilada. The quesadilla was delicious but the lobster enchilada was a little on the sweet side. For desert we had the sophapillas. They were so light and fluffy, one of my favorites.   I will definitely make my way back soon.

We went for a late breakfast today. A is close to home and I really enjoy the fact that they are locally owned and use local foods. The food was great and I would have given 5 stars but the service was not great. We really enjoyed the "Hit the Spot" pancakes and the El Jeffe omelet.  Will head back and try their Happy Hour for sure.

We went here for dinner last night. To start, the $$ rating is very misleading. The prices are on the high side. The chop salad was amazing per the previous reviews but the entrees we ordered, Lamb Burger and Chicken, were both overcooked and very dry. I can see going back here for a happy hour but never for dinner. Just not worth it.

Grabbed lunch here yesterday. I often visit the location in Tempe for lunch from work so I know the food and selection of sandwiches is great,  However, this located was very poorly organized, the seating was limited and the hair was obviously not set low enough. The line to order is located down a narrow walkway towards the back of the shop.   I will stick with grabbing lunch at the location by place of business. :-(

We took in the World Cup Final here on Sunday with a few friends.   The beer selection is off the charts. Loved the San Tan Epicenter. We had the Pretzel with Beer Sauce as well, delicious and good to share. Last we had the Haus Brat and the Spicy Brat. Their homemade sauerkraut was off the charts as a topping.   The game was slow but the people and staff were fun and charming. Certainly a place we will be visiting again and again.  Only drawback is the size of the bar area - a little cramped.

Enjoyed a great dinner here this evening. The service was very friendly and enjoyable. The rolls and sushimi  were fresh and delicious as well.  They have a great selection of drinks and food. Hidden gem tucked away next to Fry Marketplace. Good times.

We had lunch at  Joyride yesterday. Absolutely amazing. Fabulous service, fun atmosphere and the tacos were off the charts. I had the Carne Asada, chicken Tinga and Ahi tuna tacos. All were amazing but my favorite was the Chicken Tinga.   I would highly recommend this spot. I will certainly be returning soon.

A friend and I stopped by for Happy Hour and some dinner last week. Very nice bar area, open, inviting and classy. The Happy Hour specials were very nice. We were able to get a great bottle of wine for $18.  We ordered two different types of the bruschetta both were outstanding. We also enjoyed the Mahi panini, delicious.   We were invited to attend wine classes later this month. The classes were reasonably prices and we are looking forward to attending.  Overall we will surely be returning. Great little spot tucked away in the Foothills.
