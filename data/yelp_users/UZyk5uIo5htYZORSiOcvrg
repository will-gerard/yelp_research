The most ratchet gym I have ever been too. Old and rusty machines. Dated interior. Not sure why people even come here

Probably the best bagels in Scottsdale. Made in house!  A perfect example of how eating local just tastes better

Racho Pinot is everything Arizona. Make sure to try the exceptional wine list to be paired with even better meat and fish dishes. Rancho Pinot has a soft and relaxed atmosphere, but nicer dress seems appropriate. Service is great as well

Day & Night is an awesome company that has serviced my home multiple times. They have competitive rates and great response times. I know that if I have a question or issue with past service (which I haven't) they will stand behind their service 100% and truly care about the customer. If you need plumbing work done, make sure to ask for Michael Probst. I can honestly say that he does outstanding work every time I have dealt with him. As a licensed residential Realtor, I maintain a network of tradesmen that I refer clients to. I exclusively refer Day & Night to my clients, specifically Michael for plumbing work! Â    Thanks Day & Night!

Pretty damn good. Nogales is actually a van and a grill in a parking lot, not a restaurant. They have only one hotdogs to choose from, but supply a few extra optional toppings.  Hot dogs are $3 and well worth it

Great atmosphere for a Friday night, but the sushi quality is lacking the standard found (and expected) elsewhere in Scottsdale. Friendly staff, but expect to find dirty dishes and sticky menus laden with slimy fingerprints. To make things worse, the sushi was below par and the salmon roll was littered with fish bones. Big no no  Try Sumo Maya, Roka Akor, or Stingray for a better sushi outing.

Awesome local coffee shop that roasts its own beans. Great atmosphere with patio overlooking a lake. Tucked in behind the Chipotle. One of 2 coffee shops worth coming to in Scottsdale!

Great food concept in a fun little restaurant space. Unfortunately the staff are slightly inexperienced, but the experience is more than compensated by the kitchen staff, which are top notch!   Tip: try the Huevos Rancheros

Great pizza and foccacia sandwiches. Forno Fabbri is a more casual market while Pomo is slightly nicer with a sit down menu experience. Such great food, but I hate to say that the service and workers are generally unfriendly.

Similar to Sauce pizza. Pretty damn good, especially the  new chicken pizza (no olives of course)

I had a great experience here today. Nice shop with tv's, friendly staff, and full service haircuts. Most barbershops are unfriendly and give off hostile vibes, this one doesn't! I'll be coming back every two weeks

Awesome atmosphere with a professional kitchen. Unique Mexican-Japanese fusion. Make sure to try the Korean Beef Tacos and don't miss brunch on the weekends!

Eggstasy is a local breakfast concept with a chic and refreshing interior, coupled by a surprisingly unique menu. The staff are young and friendly, serving an increasingly larger clientele. On the weekends, it's not uncommon to find Eggstasy customers queuing out the door, hoping to get a table inside.   This area desperately needed a local breakfast place worth going to. Now we don't have to commute south to Arcadia to find palatable breakfast cuisine    Make sure to try the Dali Skillet if you like spicy chorizo and eggs!

Being so new, Sip's service and operations are certainly not yet polished. But considering the drive-thru, larger bar, larger food menu, great parking, and larger seating area, there is no doubt that, with time, Sip Beer Garage will be as good or better than its sister location in Old Town!

Incredible potential. The Camby needs to sort through it's new establishment hiccups, but once these have been overcome, The Camby will be the hottest addition to Phoenix's already buzzing hotel scene.

This gym used to be 24hr Fitness but was bought out by LA Fitness. It's honestly pretty gross: creaky and rusted equipment that is broken regularly, underwhelming group classes, and a locker room/pool area that looks like it has rabies. Supposedly it was to be renovated "in 6 months". 7 months later nothing has changed so I just cancelled my membership. out

Awesome barbershop with a friendly and welcoming staff. Enjoy a beer or bourbon in the most beautiful barbershop you will ever see.   No brooding and cranky men to be found. They don't peddle gold or pawn things out of the shop like the sleazy competition in the area, (thankfully)
