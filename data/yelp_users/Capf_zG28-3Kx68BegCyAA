Great service, quick turn around time, and CHEAP prices! This is the only place my boyfriend and I go to for our dry cleaning now.

I had to update my previous review after having visited twice more. I don't know her name but the waitress with the dark hair and horn ear gauges is absolutely awesome! Previously we had really crummy service, but lately we've had great attentive folks. This place is definitely starting to become a family favorite. As always, the food, coffee, and mimosas are fantastic!

My boyfriend and I stopped by for a nice little unique dinner and we got just that! The pasties are simple but full of great flavor. He had the carne adobada while I tried the greek (veggie-friendly option). We were both pretty impressed. Beer selection was pretty solid. Overall, we had a great time and would come back again.  Entrance is kind of odd, just a heads up.

I would personally give this place 5 stars, but I admit that they had several flaws that might bother others.  Things I liked: cleanliness, prices, and Steven! Oh my goodness, did that man do a fantastic job. If you want details then he's the guy to see. Also, he did a wonderful job checking in with me to ensure I liked his work before he continued.  Things you may not like: staff as a whole isn't very welcoming, creepy quiet, no offered beverage, no hand massage, and lacking decor.  Again, these factors didn't mean very much to me, but just a heads up if they mean a lot to you. I'll DEFINITELY be back =]

I've been to this location one too many times and figured it was about time I write this. Although it is conveniently located down the street from place, it has continued to offer sub-par service for the past 5 months. While the staff is...mostly...friendly, they are very unprofessional and spend more time openly talking to eachother about their personal lives than to me. As for drinks, 9 times out of 10 my order is made wrong. Iced coffee sweetened with cream? How do I end up with everything BUT that? Not to mention they've forgotten my food order multiple times and I've had to ask for it again.  I wish I could say it was just me but my boyfriend usually stops by on his way to work and has just as bad a time.  Manager, please save your store!

Amazing coffee! Truly a one-of-a-kind coffee flavor experience.  I'd agree with some of the other reviews that this place definitely has a hipster vibe, but thankfully the staff was kind and helpful.  The "condiment" bar only had some cane sugar syrup and I had to ask the barista for some cream- just a heads up.

Amazing! Fantastic food and wine. Not to mention the service was fairly quick and everyone was very friendly. Highly recommend the mushroom pizza- the truffle oil is divine. We'll be back again!

Came here with family for our first zip line experience and we had a so much fun! The staff is extremely professional, safe, and fun. They begin by going over safety and basics in a small room at the facility before you head out to bootleg canyon. When you get up to the zip line they walk you through all of the procedures again. We went during the day, but I would definitely go back for their moonlight zips.

I moved to phoenix from northern California where I would get my Dutch Bros. fix almost every day! Either I was spoiled by the great customer service in my area or the service here is really that horrible. I've gone a handful of times and they have all been extremely shallow and inattentive. Not to mention they've all charged me different prices for the same drink! One person charges me $3.50 and someone else charges me $5.25?? Get your act together and be a bit more friendly and real with your customers.

First and foremost, this place has a great view! Quick and attentive service. Reasonable prices and good lunch specials. Fresh and yummy guacamole made right at the table. Overall a fantastic find!

Great food, unique set-up, good music, and friendly service. My boyfriend and I tried this place out for my birthday and we both loved it. Artichoke dip is amazing!

I have been in twice now and I was highly impressed on both occasions! I trust Aveda salons and this place certainly confirms that trust. This most recent visit I had a hair trim, color, and partial highlights from a gal named Emily. I LOVE this girl! I'm totally a socially awkward misfit and getting my hair done is usually uncomfortable since I have no idea what to talk about. Emily made me feel so comfortable and I actually had fun talking to her. Of course she did a fantastic job with my hair and I was beyond happy with the results. As an Aveda stylist she was very knowledgeable about her work and products AND she didn't push any sales on me! Her knowledge alone convinced me to buy a few items.

My boyfriend and I came here on a Groupon deal and we were so happy we did! The beer was fantastic and the atmosphere was comfortable and laid-back.   It's a taproom, so if you're looking for the dinner and beer combo then this isn't the place. Now, if you're looking for a good beer, maybe some pretzels, and great people to talk to (including the co-founder George!) then this is definitely the place you want to be.   Can't wait to go again.

I just had my very first Plato's Closet experience and I was highly impressed. I had read some reviews for Scottsdale and Chandler and was nervous to hear that so many shoppers had experienced such poor customer service, but Glendale didn't seem to have that rep. Sure enough the employees at this location were kind, attentive, helpful and overall friendly.  The clothing selection was very diverse and reasonably priced. Better signage could help the organization of items but it wasn't too shabby overall. As for selling my clothes there, I expected a little more profit but I wasn't too shocked about that. However, I was shocked that they didn't offer a higher amount in store credit. The local places at which I use to consign would typically offer you less in cash and more in store credit. I was pretty bummed about that aspect.

Great menu and atmosphere. Service wasn't the best, but the manager handled the situation very well and professionally. Unfortunately I found a dead fly tucked into the paper on my wrap. We may have had a fluke bad experience, but I won't be rushing back anytime soon.

Amazing food and great service! Everything tasted fresh and the sweet potato tots were a pleasant surprise of deliciousness- definitely recommend them! Our waiter forgot to give us the yelp discount on the brownies but no biggie because they were soooo worth every penny!

My boyfriend and I have stayed at Hotel Palomar twice now and we have had exceptional experiences each time!   This weekend we stayed for my birthday and the staff outdid themselves sending a bottle of wine, fruit platter, and a HAND-WRITTEN birthday card with vouchers for 2 drinks at the bar to our room.   I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to treat themselves to a nice fancy little getaway.

Looking at the other reviews, either things have really turned around at this place or I got lucky! I was seen with 5 minutes of walking in and treated with the upmost respect and kindness by a very professional and knowledgable staff. My boyfriend also went in a few months ago and had a very similar experience. Hopefully I won't have to go again anytime soon, but it's nice to know this place is there if/when I need it!

Amazing food and wonderful service! I wasn't sure how the setup worked but the staff was very friendly, made great recommendations, and they let me sample a few things as well! A bowl has a lot of food- neither my boyfriend nor I could finish it! I love that they offer falafels as a vegetarian option, and the beet hummus is a must try (I don't even like beets). Go here NOW!

Amazing food and service! I had the breakfast burrito and my boyfriend tried the  Chilaquiles Benedict and we both cleared our plates. Not going to lie, my burrito was pretty good but his dish was even better so I highly recommend that. It was a small factor but the music choice was also pretty epic. I'm down to eat breakfast and bob my head to some BiggieBiggieBiggie can't you see.  Unfortunately this place loses a star to its subpar coffee. If you're paying over $10 a plate you deserve a good cup of coffee.

A friend of mine recommended this place and I just tried it today for lunch and it was AMAZING. Gorgeous decor definitely caught my eye first and the entire place is airy with plenty of natural light. Everyone working was very polite and helpful. The gal at the register recommended the sweet potatoes and I'm glad I tried them (I usually despise sweet potatoes but these are exceptional). The veggies were fresh and well seasoned, and the gluten free Mac n Cheese was creamy and delicious. My niece tried one of the salads and it definitely filled her up! I really look forward to coming back again soon!

I used to love this place but now I'm kind of over it. Rarely do I find cute clothes suitable for someone over 18. Sadly, as the other reviews say, customer service is just awful. The girls working just don't really seem to care about anything other than themselves and talking to each other. Like I said, I used to love coming here, but now I think I'll just keep my business at Buffalo Exchange

Think of this place as Cartel's younger sister-  a little feminine and a bit more modern, but with the same handmade coffee/pastry touch. The salted brûlée latte, while sweet, is a good sample of their quality. This may be my new coffee place
