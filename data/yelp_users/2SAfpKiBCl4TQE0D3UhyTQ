Very good and authentic Chinese food... I have worked in a Chinese restaurant, and been to China. It is always a good indicator when it is Chinese owned & operated, and when the customers are mostly Chinese.

The most authentic and good Mexican food I have eaten north of the border!  Even better than Carolina's! They are not open for dinner.

Wow!...I'm going back!  I was a waiter in a Chinese owned and operated restaurant in college, and I lived in Asia for a year, AND, visited both China & Hong Kong, so I KNOW authentic Chinese food.  This place is the real thing.  Not to mention great friendly service, and their water is definitely not tap water...It tastes great.  I love these 'mom & pop' family-owned businesses.  You just know you are going to get great food when the place is not much to look at from the inside or the outside, which means the ONLY reason they are still in business is really good food & service!  I was surprised they were pretty busy for a Monday night, with several take-out orders.  It is hard to fine a Chinese place that is open 7 days a week, and particularly on Mondays.  If you don't like this place, you don't know REAL Chinese food, so just go back to your chain China Gate & Pei Wei crap! LOL

A vastly superior alternative to the same-old Subway-style sandwich shops...I hate them, and their long lines!  They have a great soup, half sandwich, and salad menu choice that is not to be missed.  All three were excellent!  And, the decor does not feel like a chain restaurant.  You won't be disappointed!

Cowboy Ciao is consistantly excellent, which is surprising, since they own Digestif across the street, which is one of the worst food I have ever eaten....Go figure.  Definitely get the chopped salad side dish/appetizer, and their margaritas are pretty good too!

Superior in every way!...Great: food, service, & atmosphere.  The prices are comenserate with the experience.  You won't be disappointed.  I have dined here many times over the past few years.  Everything is consistant.  Definitely try the Tom Ka Gai soup!...Always a crowd pleaser.

Having lived in Japan for a year, it still amazes me what actually passes for 'sushi' in this town.  A couple of rice paper lanterns, and some raw fish tossed on a plate, is definitely not the standard I am used to.  Call me a purist, but I prefer my sushi chef to be Japanese...Not a white or hispanic high school drop-out.  Seriously, in Japan, the sushi apprentices are not allow to actually touch fish for at least two years....They are sharpening knives, making deliveries, etc. -- They learn to respect the career.  At RA, the food is marginal at best, and the decor is worse.  Plus, the rock 'n roll blaring during happy hour was the final straw for me.  Definitely skip this chain, and go to any other sushi place....You can't do any worse.

Horrible non-Japanese sushi, over-priced, with ear-splitting ghetto rap music. If you're 21 years old, and love crap food, this place is for you. Otherwise, head to Kyoto up the street...Japanese owned, and great prices.

Not the best sushi I have eaten, but still very good...And, the prices are INSANELY CHEAP!!!  Get this...The dinner salad, miso soup, and stir-fried rice side dishes are only $1.50 each!!  And, all 3 are delicious!  Finally, they are starting to get native Japanese servers again, who actually understand the sushi experience, and how to serve the customers properly.  I lived in Japan for a year, so I know what I am talking about....Many of the non-Japanese servers just don't get it, and the service can be 'awkard' to say the least.  Sometimes the food quality can vary, depending on which sushi chef is working that day.  Sad but true...Some are better than others.  P.S., Each 22oz bottle of beer comes with a free small bottle of sake. -- Obviously not high quality sake.  They have teppanyaki grills/seating as well, but I haven't tried them in the 22 years I have been going to Kyoto.  I miss Ayako's grills too much.  (Be sure to have your server validate your valet, which they don't have every day.)

CLOSED: They not only did not reopen, they never remodeled, as their phone message said for the past 9 weeks.  They closed on August 1st, 2015, and they said they would reopen on Oct 8th, 2015, but when we showed up for the reopening, we looked through the windows, and it looked exactly the same as when they closed. I fear they will never reopen.

Both the soup and entree were VERY sour, and I have worked in a Chinese restaurant and been to China years ago. Sadly, I cannot recommend this place.

The food was surprisingly good, but expensive, as compared with Kyoto a block north.  Not the best sushi I have had, but solidly good.  I like the decor in the small restaurant where the sushi bar is, but not the bar area.  However, this restaurant is VERY, VERY LOUD!!  Seriously, you can't even have a conversation!  I much prefer to sit outside on the patio, or go elsewhere.  Sad, but true.

Ouch & GROSS!  Expensive and Disgusting!!  "Cal-Ital" food...How stupid.  Honestly, I ordered the number one listed and recommended item on the menu seafood carbonara pasta dish, and it was absolutely tasteless.  It tasted like wallpaper paste!    It was surprisingly awful, since it is owned by Cowboy Ciao across the street, which is very good.  For good carbonara, go to Uncle Sal's - formerly mafia owned by Sammy "The Bull" Gravano.  I choose good food over decore anytime!

WOW!...What a great happy hour place.  Currentlly, happy hour goes until 8pm, and not only were the margaritas some of the best I have had, but they are only $5.00.  And, the really good appetizers are half price.  So good!  Great decor and service too! (P.S., We sat in the bar.)

We had a really great brunch at Metro, but definitely not cheap.  They have really great mimosa, and similar type drinks.  You've got to try the deep-fried bacon with maple syrup & bourbon dipping sauce...Not low fat, but so good.  A unique French-style place.

Very good food and drinks...Guac, Street Corn, Carne tacos, & Margaritas. So good, that I went back for lunch the next Saturday and ordered a marg and guac again,, and I was disappointed.  Obviously, the lunch chef and bartender are different than the prior Saturday night, and consistency is a problem for this restaurant.

What a great brunch/lunch place.  The decor was great...The breakfast burrito was excellent, and the servers went above and beyond to satisfy the overly particular freak I was eating with.  I am definitely going back again, without the freak.  If I owned a restaurant/bar establishment, I would hire these two young ladies away from Bacon, in a heartbeat.

Great food & service.  Too bad they were bought-out and are closing on Saturday Nov 8th. Our server said the new restaurant will called Upton, with TV's in the patio walls. Clearly, it will no longer be fine dining, but yet another Old Town sports-type place.

This was a great place for Sunday brunch on a beautiful spring day. We sat at the outdoor bar, rather than wait for a table, with no reservations.  The hot ham & cheese breakfast sandwich was delicious. Good service too. This place is a true 'valley of the sun' classic.

Wow!  Great happy hour!  Great food, drinks, service, & prices!   The sangria and tapas were excellent!  Everyone in our group thought so.  Happy hour 2-4-1 prices end at 7pm.  Just make sure your are mindful of where you sit, as the setting sun will 'cook' you...No 'sun management' yet.

Really good margs, guac, & enchiladas...And, I am hard to please.  Bario Cafe has some competition, and without the limited seating-wait!  Did I mentions REALLY good guac?!!!...Not that whipped-up garbage that most places 'call' guac.!

Warning...You won't get to see an actual Dr. They misdiagnosed me, and I knew it.  So, I got a second opinion from a real MD, who confirmed their misdiagnosis.  Don't go to this place....It's a waste of time and money.

Still the same great food and service in a new much larger location, with an actual sports bar!  If you like the old location, you'll love the new location!

Yikes...I won't be going back.  The ordering system is confusing. The staff also seemed confused. The food was very bland and pretty tasteless.  THIS PLACE IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS HONEY BEAR'S NEAR THE AIRPORT!! Skip this bland chain, and go to Honey Bear's!

I went there for lunch today, and the decor is really nice, large, open, airy, and modern.  Of course the weather was really good, and they had all the glass walls open to the patios.  Having lived in Japan for a year, I am a sushi purist, but the Mexican-Japanese fusion is well paired.  I only tried one item...The rock shrimp tuna roll.  It was good!  I will definitely be going back to try more items.

Really good food, service, & drinks. Make sure to make reservations, because it is really small inside during the hot season. There is lots of patio seating when the weather is nice.

Bad Margs...Way too sour! Horrible plate presentation! It actually looked like someone had eaten off of this plate already. The only reason I didn't give them 1 star, is the sklrt steak taco was decent. Skip this place, and go to the Mission.
