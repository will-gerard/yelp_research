I am a huge Teriyaki chicken fan, so I tried this place based on Yelp reviews.  My fellow yelp'ers weren't far off the mark.  I ordered the white meat Teriyaki Chicken bowl with brown rice, along with a pork egg roll and a large drink.  The meal arrived at my table quickly.  Upon first bite, I was taken aback because the teriyaki sauces I've tried are really, really sweet.  This sauce is not as sweet, but much more flavorful.  The egg roll was good, but the sweet/sour sauce it came with was better than I've ever had.  Simple, sweet, and not gooey or gloopy.    One of the owners (a wonderfully pleasant aging Japanese woman) came to my table and offered me chopsticks and hot mustard -- we had a delightful conversation wherein she explained that the chicken is hormone-free and char-grilled over pumice stones, and their sauces are home-made from family recipes.  They also offer many healthy options, including brown rice and vegetarian dishes, and NO MSG IS ADDED!!  She was a fantastic host.    Everyone seemed to be hurrying around, but they were all doing a great job keeping the customers happy by refilling drinks, delivering orders and making conversation with the people inside and outside the shop.  All in all, a great experience.  I told the owner I would be back with my son by the end of the week, and I plan to keep my promise!  Great job, Blue Fin!

The FIRST TIME I've ever eaten a steak without ketchup!  No, seriously.  My family has teased me for years, but I like the taste of steak with ketchup, always have.  Didn't need it here!  Celebrated Father's Day a little early with dear hubby. Reservation for 6:00 PM, we were greeted BY NAME by each person who served us. Having never been here before, really didn't know what to expect, but our server was killer polite and helped us understand the steak prep a little better.   I had the harvest salad (the best salad I've ever had, no lie, and it was HUGE!) and DH had the caesar.  He said it was very good. We ordered wine, which complimented the meal spectacularly.  We each had the filet with shrimp combo, and DH had the blue cheese crumble topping on his. I think I died and went to steak heaven!  The topping was crunchy, creamy, and just delicious.  Like I said before, no ketchup anywhere on my plate.  I have never tasted a steak so delicious, so tender, so awesomely cooked with awesomeness.  We also had creamed spinach (meh), garlic green beans (these were delish) and a crab cake (again, delish!).  All in all, a terrific dinner.  Well over $200, but a terrific dinner nonetheless.  Already planning a return trip for 10th wedding anniversary.  Can you say, "GIFT CARDS!?!!"

Amazing restaurant!  Staff was friendly and helpful -- This is the kind of place where they place the napkin in your lap!  We ordered the Canoe for Two, which consisted of two shrimp, two crispy spicy tuna rolls, two lobster potstickers, two Shanghai short ribs and two chicken katsu, all with their corresponding sauces.  This gave us an opportunity to try some of the different appetizers on the menu.  I ordered Roy's Trio (a trio of fish -- Hibachi Salmon, Macadamia-encrusted Ahi and Miso-Soy Butterfish) with asparagus and macadamia-pesto risotto.  The butterfish was my absolute favorite -- it didn't fall apart on the plate like some fish does, and it was cooked perfectly! My husband ordered the filet mignon with poblano mashed potatoes and asparagus.  His filet had a demi-glace that was divine.  The steak was cooked just as ordered and was a joy to eat.  We ordered cappucinos and we each ordered dessert -- I had the hot chocolate souffle (delectable!) and DH had the pineapple upside-down cake (delicious!).  Both were served with ice cream.  Our server was Melissa, and she did a fabulous job!

Love this Whataburger, especially their breakfast...BUT. We sat in the drive-thru line for 15 MINUTES waiting for two bacon breakfast sandwiches with hash browns & coffee!! The service on this Sunday morning was less than exemplary!  UPDATE:  I spoke with the manager of the restaurant, who promised me that he would investigate and take care of the situation. He offered two free meals in return for our "return," which to us is well worth it because we love Whataburger!

LOVE this place!  Small town breakfast and lunch joynt featured in Arizona Highways a few years back.  Everything we've had here was fantastic, and we just keep going back.  The pancakes are absolutely delicious, and the biscuits and gravy?  Oh Em Gee.  1/2 order is enough for my hubby and I to share (and STILL have some for take home), and he gets an omelet and I get a Barrel Racer.  And Dot, the owner, is a small, red-haired cowgirl who knows how to treat her customers.  FIVE STARS.  No, really.

Tried this restaurant based on other Yelper's reviews.  I'd been seeking a great Chinese place in Goodyear since we moved in August 2011, and the only place I'd liked was Eest Chinese on Dysart.  I was in for a treat.  Visited at lunch and as I was seated, the waitress immediately brought over a small teapot of oolong.  It was warm and perfect for a rainy day, and I don't know any Chinese places that do this any more!  I ordered the Sweet/Sour Shrimp lunch entree (only $6.25!), and upgraded my soup for an extra .50 to Hot & Sour.    When the waitress brought my soup, I requested "crunchies" (wonton strips), which she brought with no complaints.  The H&S soup was the best I've ever had!  Pepper spicy, it cleared my sinuses, but it was amazing.   My food arrived quickly and the dish was steaming hot.  There was a huge serving of fried rice, an egg roll, two crab puffs and EIGHT beautiful fried shrimp on my plate!  The shrimp was tender, a little overfried, but I've been back since and it's been better.  The fried rice was deliciously tender and the egg roll was excellent, especially with their house-made Chinese mustard (WOO HOO, it's HOT!!).  The crab puffs weren't really crabby, mostly cream cheese, but they were good.  My total bill was $7.82!  Best Chinese I've had in a l-oooong time.  Picked up a take-out menu as i was leaving and noticed they had "Almond Duck" and "Sweet & Sour Duck" on the dinner menu.  I've been looking for "Almond Duck" -- square-shaped pressed duck covered in sweet/sour sauce and topped with almonds -- for the last 20 YEARS or so!  I'm going back to try both of these dishes on their menu!   P.S. -- I've been once more since my first visit -- I took my son, who isn't really a Chinese fan, but he got the Moo Goo Gai Pan and LOVED it.

Who DOESN'T want a margarita at 3 in the afternoon?!  I was headed to Gammage for the Broadway show Wicked.  I started with a double shot of Cabo Wabo Anejo and a 20th Anniversary Marg.  Nice way to kickstart the evening!  Enjoyed a Z Salad (my fave) and an order of cast-iron skillet dumplings.  Both were absolutely delicious!  I had to keep after the waitress for water, cornbread and MY CHECK!!  I was almost late to the show because she took 20 minutes getting my check to me!    Interesting, though, was the fact that I had originally ordered a different tequila shot and the waitress returned to tell me they were out of it, so I ordered the Cabo Wabo.  It wasn't until a few days later that I looked at my receipt and noticed she had still charged me for the first shot (they were out of).  $10.25!!!  Did I say it was $10.25?!!  OUCH!!!   I immediately contacted the restaurant and spoke to a manager named Angela.  She was extremely helpful and immediately resolved the situation.  Not only did she refund the $10.25 to my card, but she also sent me $20 in gift certificates!  No worries, Z'Tejas -- I'll be back!!  Love this place!

Bacon? Outstanding.  Griddle cakes?  Crave-worthy.  Home-fries?  Awesomely awesome.  Service?  Ehhh.  Love this little joint tucked into a one-bedroom house!  The food was amazing -- I can still taste those griddle cakes, BUT the service left something to be desired (more about that later).  My hubby got the three-meat scramble with hashbrowns, and it came with a tortilla.  He gobbled it down, apparently it was really good.  We never got any hot sauce, after two requests.  I ordered the two-egg breakfast with bacon.  The bacon was to die for, the best I think I've ever had.  The thick sourdough toast which accompanied my meal was served with real butter and fresh strawberry jam.  The combo was killer!  All in all, a fantastic breakfast!  About the service -- The female waitress who greeted me at the door specifically told myself and two other parties that were waiting that they ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES, no waiting at the table for someone else to show.  She must have said this three or four times.  I pointed to my hubby, who was parking the car across the street and told her he'd be here in just a minute, and she reiterated, WE ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES.  I was told to add my name to a list outside, even though he was 30 seconds away!  An older woman appears at the door and asks for a table, and tells the waitress her husband is parking the car.  "Oh, okay, I can get you a table right now," says the waitress.  No "WE ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES."  No "ADD YOUR NAME TO THE LIST OUTSIDE EVEN THOUGH HE MIGHT BE HERE IN 30 SECONDS."  Noooooo.  Instead it's "Oh, okay, I can get you a table right now."  GRRRRRR.  I piped up and said, "Oh, here he is.  We're ready now."  The waitress responds, "I'm going to get her a table, I'll be right back."  GRRRR.  I HATE people who say one thing and do another.  I was seeing red at this point, but the place is so danged small I couldn't tell my hubby what I was so pissed off about!!!  Anyhow, the waitress "that wouldn't seat us" buzzed our table once or twice, and I asked for water THREE TIMES before a very kind gentleman waiter got it for me.  They forgot my OJ -- he brought it out after I asked the other waitresses TWICE.  Hot sauce?  Never appeared on our table, even after two requests.  Just a tip -- the female waitresses were ditzy as hell.  Ask for a male waiter!!  (sorry if that sounds sexist, but I'm a woman and I know what good service looks like.  This was NOT IT.)  My rating above is based on the FOOD (5 STARS) minus one star for the SERVICE (TWO STARS).  (I know, I know, five minus two is three, but I just couldn't bring the food rating that low, It was THAT GOOD)  In fact, I think I'm heading out now for some of those griddle cakes.  From a male server.  See ya!

For a romantic dinner, the patio of this small cafe is beautiful at night.  We sat outside as the lights began to come on throughout, it was wonderful.  We enjoyed two margaritas at happy hour prices each!  We also enjoyed wonderful pork empanadas, they were huge!  I ordered the seafood chile relleno with green chile cornbread and the maple-glazed chipotle carrots.  My honey ordered the chipotle chicken with green chile cornbread and chipotle mashed.  We were highly impressed with the quality of the food -- everything was fresh and delicious.  The prices were high, though.  Anyhow, still a fan.

After trying several close-by salons after moving to Goodyear 1.5 years ago, I found this gem! Helia, the owner, gave me the best haircut since another stylist at a different salon gave me a mullet last year)!  Helia is awesome, and I will be back!!!

Well, I was wrong. I admit it. I wanted to love this place, I really did.  Walking in for the appointment I'd made a month before to get my hair done for my college graduation, I discover my stylist (who's also the owner) of Vega, Helia, starting a walk-in client's hair. My appointment was at 1:00 PM and at 1:45, I was still not in the chair. Helia spent 15 minutes playing with the client's baby while I waited.  Graduation was at 6 and I didn't have time to get my nails done too because I had to wait for her to finish the walk-in client.  It was absolutely ridiculous!!    While I was waiting, I noticed dark hair in the brushes she was using that were NOT MINE!! To top if off, there was not one jar of Barbicide in the shop that I could see.   Think I'll be looking elsewhere for a hairstylist.

Drove from SUN CITY to visit this joynt. The buzz about this place (after Guy Fieri's visit on Food Network's Triple D) is amazing.  You could feel the freshness in the air.  Out near Agritopia, a master-planned community in Gilbert, this place REEKS old-time farmer cookin'!    There was a line out the door, but the crowd was in a convivial mood, so we enjoyed standing in line.  After approx. 15-20 minutes, we got to the order window.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna sandwich with a side of fried zucchini, hubby ordered the BBQ bacon blue cheeseburger with a side of fries, and a BBQ chicken pizza to share (and take home for leftovers).  We also ordered a side of onion rings and a cheesecake.  Hubby ordered a sprite, I had their fresh-squeezed lemonade.  The Ahi Tuna sandwich was delicious.  The slaw and wasabi mayo added great flavor.  The bun was fresh, fresh, fresh and probably the best hamburger bun I've ever eaten, melt in your mouth, I kid you not. However, not being a fan of raw fish, I ended up eating around the raw parts, which left very little to go down.  I will get the tuna cooked "well done" next time.  The zucchini was really good, but the pieces were so large, they really needed a fork & knife.  The house-made marinara was obviously house-made, and it had very rich flavor, delicious.  The lemonade was a full quart and, believe me, I drank it all.  It was the best I've ever consumed.  Hubby's BBQ Bacon Blue cheeseburger was awesome!  So huge, he could barely get his hands around it.  When he asked me to take a bite, I asked him to cut it in half.  Delicious freshly-picked veggies (lettuce, tomato, and red onion).  His fries were "meh," but the onion rings were da bomb!  Thick-cut, sweet and delicious morsels of onion and fried panko, some of the best I've eaten.  The BBQ Chicken pizza was spectacular, but I thought it would be bigger.  It's definitely enough for one hungry person, but we had leftovers, so it's all good.  Joe, we will DRIVE 60 miles one way to sample your fresh-tastin' goodness!  WE WILL BE BACK!!!

Went on a Sunday morning around 10, as Black Bear Diner was full with people waiting.  This place had good reviews on Yelp, and no wait!  The waitress offered us coffee, so we took her up on her offer.  The coffee was awesome!  I inquired about the biscuits and gravy, but the waitress said they were out of biscuits and of sausage.  Hubby & I both ordered the Southwest Omelette (black beans, corn, red & green bell peppers, onion, jalapeno and cheese) and added bacon to it.  I also ordered a side of gravy (hey, I judge biscuits & gravy by the gravy, too -- I wanted to try it!).  The food came and it looked amazing.  There were several tater tots on the side, so we dipped these in the gravy -- YUMMM!  The omelette also came with sour cream, fresh-made pico and guac on the side.  It was smashing.  The omelette had cheese baked on top, it was soooo good.  We both were really delighted in the amount of food (which I couldn't finish) we received and the price.  We were out, with tip, under $20!  Taps, we WILL be back for dinner!  I want to try that Blue Crab Pizza!!

Great lunch specials! Had the sweet/sour shrimp and my guest tried the sweet/sour pork.  Each came with fried rice, choice of egg drop or hot/sour soup (he got egg drop, I tried the hot/sour, which was fabulous) and a crab puff.  We also ordered appetizers of crab puffs and potstickers.  The crab puffs were really cheesy, but with extra sweet/sour, who cares?!  The potstickers came with a wonderful soy-ish sauce that my guest added to his fried rice.  The overall meal was delicious!  We will be back!!

Let me just say -- YUM!!  This was my choice on Valentine's Day (I know -- WHAT?! -- but we celebrate V-Day EVERY DAY of the year, it's just another day to take your $$).    Anyway, they offer FREE fresh, homemade soup while you're waiting for your meal (Lentil or Chicken Lemon Rice), so we tried one of each.  Delicious!  I ordered the Gyro Pita and Greek Fries and my husband ordered the Gyro Combo Plate (Gyro meat and Chicken Souvlaki).  The plates came and his platter was enormous, covered with meat and rice and pita, and my pita was STUFFED with the best gyro meat I've ever had.  Not too salty, but very flavorful.  The fries were lightly sprinkled with feta cheese, and they gave an extra side of tzatziki on the side.  I could only eat half of the sandwich, it was so much food!  Needless to say, I was a very happy girl!  Try it, it's delicious food with great prices and a very friendly staff.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

My 19-y.o. son Michael had never been to a barber shop.  He was very impressed with the quality of service and they went above and beyond to make sure the haircut looked good. The hot towel and back/shoulder massage topped off the haircut -- he was treated to a "real" guy experience.  We will be back!!

Good burgers, but the breakfast? Be still my heart...French toast is drive-worthy. One star removed for waiting 35 min. for breakfast.  Staff was hopping, I think they were just short-staffed.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  We've been there three times and I love it more each time.  Fresh, healthy food made in-store. They offer you a choice of chips or a piece of fruit (usually an orange or a banana) with your sandwich/salad or soup.  They have wraps, flatbread sandwiches and real sandwiches.  I've had their Thai Chicken wrap (chicken, wontons, carrots, sesame seeds, romaine, thai peanut dressing on a white tortilla) and their Salsa Sunrise wrap for breakfast (eggs, ham, bacon, pepper jack, salsa on a white tortilla).  Let me tell you, their salsa is SPICY!  Whew!!  Both were absolutely delicious!  The breakfast wrap I particularly enjoyed because the ingredients were fresh and you can choose from the junior size (only $1.99!!) or the regular size ($3.99).  The junior size and a smoothie is just right for the a.m. for me.  The smoothies are made with turbinado instead of sugar, or they will make them with Splenda if you ask.  I personally have tried the Blimey Limey (strawberries, pineapple, orange and lime), the Blue Lagoon (blueberries, strawberries & banana), the Sunny Day (mango, banana, orange & kiwi), and the Sunrise Sunset (strawberries, pineapple, mango & orange).  They were all wonderful, but the Sunny Day was my favorite, not too tart or too sweet.  My husband swears by their coffee smoothies, and he loves the Cinn CIty (cinnamon, coffee, cappuccino & non-fat yogurt) the best.  They have a wide variety of supplements to add to your smoothie, and I noticed there is not a lot of aftertaste (like there is at other smoothie stores) when used in their smoothies.  Will continue to patronize this little shop because we LOVE it!

Oh YUM.  Fantastic chicken strip shop!  Honey Mustard dressing is delish, Texas Toast is delish too!  The lemonade is wonderful!  Cane sauce just eh, fries are nothing new, cole slaw is bleh.  Who comes here for fries or cole slaw anyway, it's about the CHICKEN!  These strips surpass anything I've had before, they are wonderful.

LOVE Athena, she's da BOMB!!! She has great prices, and did an amazing job fixing a VERY bad haircut.  She does great color and highlights too!  Did I mention she has great prices?!!  She works every day (if her schedule allows), so she does take Sunday or Monday appointments.  This woman has a business, and it will be thriving if I have my way!  Go See ATHENA!!

Excellent, loved the mixed olive pizza.  A box of pizza has six "cuts," or slices, and you can put any toppings on any cut that you want -- Ingenious!!  Even better?  A box is only $7.00!  The cheese bread is out of this world, and the pepperoni rolls are delicious too.  Be prepared to enjoy a treat!  The owner is an Air Force vet and the one employee who was working with him was Army, so I know I'm supporting a vet-owned and operated small business.  Great pizza, Mick!

Well, my first impression on this place was TOTALLY off. We drove up and could smell the bbq. We were seated and our waitress came over to take the drink order.  We also gave her an appetizer order (We ordered the TK Platter, a little bit of everything).  The drinks arrived -- mine was blehhh weak and my husband's, which was only supposed to have had just a bit of creme de menthe, tasted ONLY of creme de menthe.  Five minutes later, she came back to take our food order.  We ordered a full rack of babybacks to share, with sides of mac n'chz and baked beans.   The appetizer came out within 5 min. after we ordered our food.  We still had no plates or silverware, and all the sauces for the appetizers were missing.  We asked for sauces, napkins, plates and silverware and the waitress kept coming back, forgetting one or two things.   We finally got all the items we had requested and our MEAL arrived!!!  We hadn't even had time to eat the appetizer!  The appetizer was okay, not great.  The wings were large, but they were dry, with hardly any sauce on them.  The nachos just had cheese -- no pulled pork, chicken or beef, just plain cheese (I could have gotten that at Taco Bell!).  The fried pickles were so overfried that they had "opened."  The mozzarella sticks were tasteless, even with the marinara -- however, the jalapeno poppers were fabulous!  The mac n'chz was totally mediocre, but the beans were delicious.  Although the ribs were tender on the inside, they were completely overcooked on the outside, and the top and bottom were stringy and impossible to eat.  To top it off, the BBQ sauce that was served with the ribs was COLD!  Really?!  We were mostly ignored throughout the experience.  The waitress was thoroughly stressed out, cute as she was, but cute doesn't get tips from me. The appetizer platter (which was large) stayed on our table (a 2-top, no less!) throughout the meal, even though trash and bones had piled up on it.  Servers and bussers worked around us and never once stopped to see if they could take some of the plates off our table. I was amazed at the tunnel vision of these employees.  Our server finally took our plates, but did not offer to bring the check.  We waited another 15 minutes until finally my husband ASKED for the check.  In that 15 minutes, she passed our table at least 10 times.  Oh, and while we were eating, one of the waitresses kept coming to the table beside ours to talk to the man who was seated there, and to hold the baby that was at the table.  After seeing her every few minutes or so, I realized it was HER bf/hubby and the baby was HERS!  She spent so much time at this table and I kept thinking to myself -- if she were serving me, I would be thoroughly p.o.'d that she wasn't taking care of her customers!  I guess I'm a little old fashioned.  That amazing smell when we drove up?  Must have been "piped out."  To say I was unimpressed is putting it mildly,  We won't return.  End of rant.

Stopped here based on previous reviews. This has to be the WORST Chinese food I've ever had. Orange chicken and Sweet/sour chicken was bland, no flavor, awful sauce, and the chicken was nearly inedible. Rice had big chunks of dried rice, absolutely no flavor. Noodles were okay, nothing to write home about. Will NEVER eat here again. If I could give less than one star, I would.

Delicious sushi, made while you watch! Crab Rangoons and Beef Yakisoba are also amazing!! Our server was VERY slow -- we waited 20 min for the check and another 20 for our change!! All in all, though, a good experience!
