I order two mc doubles only Mayo mustard and onion. And a large ice tea extra ice 1/2 sweet 1/3 unsweetened. The 1st burger had way to much Mayo and bun was kind hard and dry. The 2nd one had almost no Mayo or mustard but a lot of onion the bun was so hard I couldn't bite into it.

Love this place. The guys who work the overnight shift know my voice on the phone and my car when I get there .... they are always nice. My food is made fresh and it's at just the right temp by time I get home so To eat it.
