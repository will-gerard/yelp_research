This hotel must be under new management because it wasn't filthy AT ALL. In fact, when I walked in I thought the entire place was impeccably clean. Even our room was clean and smelled terrific. A gleaming "90% sanitation" rating hung over the front desk. The beds were comfortable but the pillows were a bit lumpy. The only thing I can complain about was the maids shouting down the hall way at each other while my husband and I tried to nap after our drive. The receptionist was courteous. Oh. The rooms were small because in case anyone who complained about that can't read: you booked a room at a MICROTEL!

Nice and low key. Good food but they don't book very good bands. Mainly metal or cover bands. Their Thursday ladies night is great. It's top-notch as far as dives go. And I love my dive bars.

Chelsey was the most friendly and charismatic clerk I've ever met! She had no problem helping me with every question or concern I had with the Mystic Spray Tan and even came in the room after to help with a few minor streak issues. This girl deserves a raise :)

If that emerald chicken wasn't the best thing ever!!! They could use some egg rolls or crab rangoon though.

This is misleading. The price range for this restaurant should really be $$$ because everything was rather expensive. I looked this place up for brunch but we didn't get a brunch menu and it wasn't past noon yet. The food was excellent however, it is kind of an upscale restaurant which my husband and I weren't aware of and showed up in jeans and t shirts while everyone was definitely in business clothing. That was awkward but the staff was still nice to us even though we stuck out like a sore thumb.

Good menu. Everything is creative but not too bourgeois.

Delicious and moderately priced. Service was speedy and the waitress was exceptionally polite and friendly.

I want it all. Give it to me NOW. It's the enchilada's version of Chipotle. I need one of these where I live.

I bet the food is great. It's too bad we didn't get to that point. My friend an I arrived a few minutes before meeting our other friend so we sat at the bar because we were kinda in a hurry. We saved her a seat and expected her any minute. Now, as far as I've ever been told about dining customs, is that the bar, whether it be one that actually serves booze or what, is open seating and can't be reserved and the host can't make you give it up. Two other girls walked in and wanted a booth but the host told them to sit at the bar instead. We told the girls we were saving this one seat for our friend and the host came over and rudely said, "YOU ARE NOT SAVING THIS SEAT!" As our friend walks in. The other girls were like hey, it's all good, we wanted a booth anyways and he MADE US sit here. Rude as FFFFFFFFF. We were confused. But hey, Jobot is just a block away and I suggest you try their chorizo biscuits and gravy because it's AMAZING.
