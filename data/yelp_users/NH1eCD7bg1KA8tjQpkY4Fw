This place never disappoints me and my family. Always good food, good service and fast service. I tell my friends all the time why waste your time with all the expensive trendy places in o town were you get a hung over party girl as your server! The absolute best! Oh and very clean too!

I am a frequent express shopper but this particular location had the worst customer service I've ever seen out of any retail store I've ever been to the people were just rude not courteous very insulting and just didn't care my girlfriend stood in line for 10 minutes to get a dressing room and was skipped over twice because the ignorance of the sales associate

I am convinced that all the people that work here are aliens! Not one person shoes any type of warm response even when my 2 year old happily sais Hi! Not even a smile cracked. Really? Never again will I shop there!

Walked in at 940pm and was told that we need to order our food and leave because they close at 10! Will never go there again!
