When it comes to going to a mall this is the one. I know most people complain that this mall has too many "kids" running around, which is true, but you'll get that with every mall.   Metrocenter Mall is a cesspool of failing businesses that all moved away and Scottsdale Fashion Square hosts "beautiful" snobs who live off of their husbands credit cards. Arrowhead Towne Center has actual normal people.  Stores worth shopping at: Macy's  Dillard's Dicks Forever 21 Hot Topic Puppies N' Love (how can you not love puppies?!?!) Aeropostale  American Eagle Gamestop  I know many people would disagree but this really is a great mall to go to.

I generally visit this Barnes and Noble to use the starbucks area but the first time I visited this location it was about to close and I ran inside to grab a bookmark and even though they closed in 5 minutes the later was badgering me to get out quickly. My girlfriend works in the area and I use this area for its wi-fi when she has shorter shifts. I usual will buy a rice crispie or a frappucino. There's this spiky haired worker  who when I don't buy something and I'm on my laptop will bother me until I buy something. Then when you buy something he still has a scowling attitude. I once was there for an hour and he asked me every ten minutes if I needed anything, giving him the same response each time. Afterwards I got up and looked at some books and it seemed one of the associates followed me around to see if I was going to steal anything. I haven't been back since.

Great place to eat in the arrowhead area. What I like to do is go there before hitting Harkins Arrowhead Fountains and get the Tortilla Soup and Chicken Tacos. It's like around $9 and fills you up. Busy enough where you can tell that it's good but isn't overly packed. Most I've ever waited was 45 minutes and that was during spring training on a saturday night.

If you live in the Surprise area and want a bar experience that isn't filled with bikers and the blue-haired crowd this is the place to go. With their good selection of beers (including Magners which is very hard to find) and on Fridays all you can eat Fish N Chip, it's a great place to go. On weekend nights I love getting some beers, sitting around the fire pit outside and then maybe playing a couple rounds of pool inside. They also have a great St. Patricks Day celebration around that time of the year.

Genghis Grill was definitely an interesting experience. When you enter they give you a bowl which you fill up with meats, vegetables and other ingredients (hint: fill that bowl as high as possible because the meat will shrink). Afterwards you pick your sauces and your starch. They even bring it to your table when it's ready. For a price like $9.99 for a bowl you'll realize that it fills you up very quickly. I followed the beef and broccoli recipe and I ended up taking half of it home in leftovers which, by the way, taste even better when you eat them the next day.

The first time I ever ate at a Filiberto's was at this location. I was a little hesitant and my girlfriend ordered for me because she's hispanic and has more knowledge about what is good. We got two tacos and a taco salad and it ended up costing like $25. Afterwards I thought it was weird that it cost that much and looked up the prices. What we ordered cost more like $14-16.   The workers here overcharge you because they don't even speak english. It's kind of sad because I've been to a couple in the ghetto of phoenix and they were delicious and the workers are awesome over there. Avoid this location though. Go to the one on 83rd or on grand if you live in surprise.
