This place is small but there is lots to be found!  They have everything from small, everyday jewelry to elaborate pieces of art for special occasions.  :)  All are beautiful!    My sister came into town and desired to buy some turquoise jewelry.  I found Chief Dodge's on Yelp, read the reviews and decided to stop by.  I was not disappointed.  My sister found exactly what she was looking for.  The ladies behind the counter were very welcoming and helpful.  I certainly recommend this place to anyone looking for turquoise jewelry.  :)  P.S.  Not everything they have in stock can be found on their website.  Call them with questions or go pay them a visit.  :)

Solid 4 stars.  Service=5. The gal taking our order was friendly and helpful; ditto for everyone else who served us.  Appetizer=5. Roasted portobello and artichoke bruschetta was great! Vegetable salad=4. The contents were good but I felt it needed something to make it pop.  Red sauce and mozzarella pasta=4. The pasta shells were on point. The sauce though tasted similar to the marinara sauce at Costco.  Molly's Caramelized Creation pizza= 5. We substituted the bacon for mushrooms but it was delicious. I imagine it would have been even more so with the bacon. The rolls= 3. Taste of bread was good but it was very hard. Maybe if they warmed it a bit prior to serving...  Overall great experience!

Highly disappointed with Mayo today! On Monday of this week I called the Referring Physician's office to see if the Radiology Department could perform a test needed by my specialist. My specialist faxed over the order. The next morning I was called by Mayo stating they had looked into it, could perform the test, and had scheduled me in for today--Friday.  I arrived at Mayo Clinic Hospital at noon to check-in at the registration desk. The lady did not see an appointment for me in the system...but she entered me in so that I could speak with a Registration person.  In the meantime I called the Referring Physician's Office to ask why my appointment was not showing in the system. The lady there told me I had been left a voicemail *this* morning canceling my appointment because they actually cannot perform the test. !!!! What?!?! I explained my frustration with the situation, especially due to the time-sensitivity of the test-and asked if there was anything that could be done. She said there wasn't. Here I am, left with no appointment, and it's such a last minute cancellation that after calling all the other Radiology Centers in the valley, there is no way for me to get this test done today.  Extreme customer discourtesy.

Customer service when taking my order was good- the gentlemen behind the counter was attentive.  The food on the other hand-  The tofu in our dish was grouped into clusters and burnt! Upon explaining & showing this to the cashier, we were given a refund but NO apology. They're so busy that quality seems to have gone out the window.  2 stars. Very disappointed.

Everyone that works here is very nice. The older gentlemen that works here, especially so.  This morning as he prepared my sandwich, one of his regulars came in. He began attending him when my sandwich was in the oven. He then got so into making the other sandwich that he almost forgot about mine. The guy who came in behind me actually jumped me in line thinking he was going to check out first...(no chivalry to be had there)..  Anyways, right as the Subway attendant started to bag the other sandwich, he seemed to have remembered mine, finished it & checked me out first.  Great sandwich nonetheless!! :)

Friendly welcome.  Clean bathroom.  Quick turnaround on the appetizer.  We had the Kung Pao Soy Chicken and the Soy Fish entrees. Both were top notch! Worth the short wait.   We'll definitely return next time we're in the area. :)  *note: the soy fish dish was on the saltier side according to my taste buds. On our drive home I definitely felt the "salt" in my body.  Now, we usually eat a low-sodium diet so your taste buds may differ in opinion.   Happy eating! :)

Good Chinese food; Fresh and tasty.  I had the Mongolian Beef.  Nice decor. Clean.  Great customer service. The only negative note I'd leave is that they charge a $2 fee if you'd like a refill of your drink "to go."...although refills while you're there are complimentary.

SO FAR SO GOOD! :)  After reading through some yelp and google reviews...and due to distance...I decided to give Mountainside Fitness a shot.  I walked in and was nicely greeted by 2 upbeat gentlemen at the front desk.  I told them I wanted to speak with someone in Membership.  The membership gal was busy with another customer so they told me they were familiar with some membership information and asked if they could help me.  We chatted for a bit during which they were very helpful.  I asked if I could tour the sauna and steam room while I waited for the membership gal, which they allowed.  The sauna and steam rooms are small (sauna is probably 1/5 the size found at Lifetime Fitness) and they didn't smell "freshly cleaned" but it was a little after 7pm and everything looked good overall.  I took a peak at the showers and locker room; they seemed in order.  I'll know more about this facilities "cleanliness" standards over the next month.  ;)  When I returned to the front desk area, the membership gal was available.  Caitie, an assistant manager, was very kind and informative during our meeting.  She answered all my questions matter-of-factly and was understanding when I shared that I was gathering all the data to then discuss with my husband.  After reviewing everything, and making a quick call to the husband, I ended up buying the one MONTH TRIAL offer.  Not the "best" deal as far as pricing goes, $55, but it's a GOOD way to know if I'll actually like the place, atmosphere, etc., prior to making a long-term commitment.  WHY 4-stars?  Customer service has been GREAT thus far!  :)  I was never hassled regarding personal training or anything I didn't go in there for.  The facility lacks a pool and I've yet to use the facilities but if the sauna smells better and both it and the steam room are clean consistently and the the facilities are clean overall....it'll certain earn 5 stars from me!  :)  Stay tuned for update.

Having thin hair I browsed the pictures on Marilo's yelp page and though I loved what I saw, didn't think my hair could look like that. Nevertheless I scheduled an appointment with Marilo hoping she could help.  Wow! Post haircut, I am so impressed! My new cut frames my face beautifully, my hair looks healthier, and has great body!  Thanks Marilo!

Woke up several times last night feeling cold. I thought maybe it was just me. This morning I checked the thermostat and the indoor temp was cooler than the heater setting... The heat wasn't coming on. I did some troubleshooting after which I called a friend asking for an HVAC referral. Her brother in law highly recommended A/C Doctors, so I gave them a call. A few hours later 2 techs were at my door. They were both friendly & wearing company shirts, which is comforting when allowing strangers into your home.  Pete (I believe that was the name of the lead tech) was super professional, seemed very motivated and happy to answer all my questions, and knew exactly where the system was having problems. He climbed into my attic and replaced/rewired a fuse very quickly. He explained everything he was doing and gave me no reason to question his integrity.  I'll certainly be calling A/C Doctors for my future HVAC repairs! Thank you!

I was awoken Friday morning at 6something by my home fire alarm system going off- LOUDLY.  The only way to shut the thing off was by flipping switches at the breaker box.  The old smoke detector upstairs had given us signs that it needed to be replaced.  This was it's ultimatum...  After calling 2 electrician I was "referred to"... -the first never returned my call -the other sounded novice with respect to fire alarm systems  I then turned to an online search with led to YELP.  After searching for electricians in the Mesa area, I came across "Good Guys Electric."  I loved the great reviews and thus gave Mike a call.  Not long after leaving him a message, he returned my call.  He was patient when I gave him the "detailed" version of my problem.  He then quickly explained what the problem was and told me how to fix it.  Afraid of getting electrocuted or such I told him I'd prefer it being professionally done.  He seemed understanding and looked at his schedule.  Of course he was booked solid next week.  He then asked if I'd mind him coming over later in the day sometime next week, after his last scheduled appointment (he knew and cared about my concern having to leave the power switched OFF in the upstairs part of our home).  I thanked him for being willing to extend his work hours.  I gave him more info and the call ended.  A few minutes went by and I kept thinking about his advice on how to solve our problem and his statement that it should be an easy fix.  Next thing you know I was in the car heading to Home Depot.  I received more expert advice there and about an hour and a youtube video tutorial later, my new alarm was fully installed and working!    Thank you Mike for being SUPER HONEST, helpful, and willing to lend expert advice to a frustrated home owner!  This problem is solved! but, if we need an electrician in the future, we'll be giving YOU a call!  :)  Thanks again!

4.5 Stars.  I've been coming to this location for 2+ years now. I LOVE their Strawberry Harvest Salad and Garden Chowder Soup! Every time I have these I am thoroughly satisfied. (The strawberry dressing is amazing! I wish they sold it!!) Customer service is always great! Advice I would give if you call in an order... look inside the bag and make sure you have everything, i.e. salad dressing, prior to leaving.  Request I would make to whoever prepared the Chocolate Strawberries today...be more generous with the chocolate please.

5 Stars! Love this studio! Started coming here 3 months ago hoping to alleviate my chronic back pain. Spoke with Nicole (owner) and she suggested several classes that would help my cause. Ffwd 3 months and my back pain is gone! Sure, I feel some discomfort from time to time but it is not the debilitating pain I experienced before.  I'm certain yoga & a plant-based diet are the reasons I am pain free today! Highly recommend this studio! They have classes for beginners and veteran yogis alike! :) Namaste.

Great food! Great service!  Sure this is no gourmet cuisine dive but you certainly get more than what you pay for. Our favorite is the baked scallop roll.  We went here for Christmas Eve dinner and left content with full bellies. They were open til 9.  For price, selection, and service-- you can't beat Teharu!
