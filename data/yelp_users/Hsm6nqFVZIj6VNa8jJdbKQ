No too bad.  UPDATE:  Urine and sewage smell has gone away.  Or maybe just today.  Cheap bar food and beer.  Decent dive bar.

Been going here for years, no over a decade now.  Always been invited by family and neighbors of Ahwatukee.  I try to talk them out of it but I get stuck going.  Why only 2 stars- the food is so below par, it's obvious they get items from Costco.  And it's over priced.

It's just okay.  Dont understand all the hype.  It's better than taco bell cause they serve liquor.   That's about it.

Ok so here's the deal:  the so called food is bland, low quality, and over priced-  I'm not a cook, but I can cook better. The reason for the 2 stars is cause it's a restaurant.    On the other hand:  large bar with awesome beer selection, great service, and interesting atmosphere.  I'd come back, if invited, 4 hh beer only.  Oh ya no wifi service

Impressed. Went there last night after drinking at Cactus Jacks.  One slice filled me up.  Not overly priced.    Interesting facts: They have a tangy/spicy sauce to dip it in and it comes with a fortune cookie.  Will be back...
