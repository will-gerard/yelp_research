Been here several times.  Each time I ordered a different dish and each time without fail, the food as been delicious. What makes this place even better are the owners. The sweetest people I have ever met...they truly care about their customers and their product.  So try it out and they will make you feel at home.

Rochelle has been cutting my hair for about 20 years and even after leaving Arizona, I make sure I always book an appointment whenever I'm back in town. She provides the highest level of service to all her clients and expects that and more for anyone who walks in the door, regardless of who they are seeing.

Nice fun atmosphere, good fresh food, and delicious kimchee. Seriously what else do you need besides the kimchee?  Definitely recommend it just know that, when it's busy you need to practically tackle the staff to get their attention. Otherwise, sake bomb away.

You don't know a good time until you hear your name sung by 5 average hot men. But seriously...Totally worth your time...small venue, intimate, great cast, and helpful staff. I didn't know what to expect, since I bought my tickets from Gold staff; but I had such a great time. Already planning our next visit with friends, hopefully for the midnight show.

Sens used to be one of my favorite resturants. The food is good and I enjoyed it for something a little different lunch.   But, recently they got a new male servier who looks like he hasn't showered in a week. He is the worse server i have ever had in my entire life. He forgets to get you what you requested, he is flat out rude without being apologetic what so ever and what was the last straw, he left me and my co-wokers waiting for 30 minutes without any water or service and completely ignoring us. After the 30 minutes we got up and he told us we were sitting at the  wrong table and told us to either move to the table or leave. He did not communicate this at all in the 30 minutes we waited and did not seem to care that all 9 of us stood up and walked out. I will never go back there again.

Some days you want a salad made the way you want...so this place sounded like a great idea...twice, five if you count the times i walked out after waiting in line for 10 minutes! Not are they always understaffed...that should say something...but it doesn't help that their manager is always scolding and berating the employees, stressing them out and causung more errors and a general sense off tension the entire time.  But the salad ends up being a soup with the excess dressing (after requesting light) and costing over $8 for a mediocre side salad...without a drink. Not going back after i made a comment to an employee about being sorry they got treated that way and the manager decided he could yell at me as well.  I'll walk down the street where i can make my own salad at Greens and actually find a seat and enjoy lunch.

Such a relaxed atmosphere. Very much like waking into a Mexican restaurant with the strolling musicians and tv's projecting Spanish tv.  But visually a Japanese restaurant with the colors and lotus lamps through out the venue.  The food was delicious and had generous portions.  Service was fast and despite being a very busy night with a birthday party...we were seated, waited on and was served fairly quickly. Definitely coming back for the carne asada roll.

Great place for a fast refreshing sweet treat. Not to mention a great place to hang out with all the games and art work.

We are from out of town and we will definitely coming back. The food was delicious, plentiful, and reasonably priced. Plus the service was responsive and everyone was very helpful and sweet.  It's a young staff and the music was good...So it made for a relaxed and fun environment.

I came with a small group and ordered the frice dish. I was disappointed at first because it was mostly rice and very light in the sauce and chicken, while my friends got their rice and fries smothered. I just asked for a little extra gravy. The person I believe to be the manger not only gave me extra gravy, she brought me a whole new order, because she didn't like the presentation.  It's the little things like that, that make me appreciate a place.  Besides the great service, the food was good, and the place is clean. I recommend trying it out.

Everything we had was incredibly delicious and fresh tasting. Since this was our first time here, i didn't know what to expect. We had a roll, bimbop, and katsu don...in each case i would have been extremely sad too see it end of i was not already stuffed. Definitely looking forward to my next visit. When it came to awarding stars, i was looking for a reason to take away some. Nothing came to mind...from the courteous and attentive staff, cleanliness, speed of food preparation, music, atmosphere; to whom ever created this place...well done, well done.
