Had the provence pizza and I'm so glad I got the extra large so I would have leftovers the next day.  Pizzeria Bianco's got nothing on this place.  Interesting ingredients, delicious crust and perfectly baked (not burned).  I definitely recommend trying the hot/bbq-ish sauce they have in the condiment area on your pizza.  Not a ton but a little adds a delicious kick.  Service was good, the place was clean and the food was delicious and organic!  Looking forward to lunch today  :o)

No wait on Tuesday at noon but you'd think the waitress was slammed judging by her bad attitude from the moment we sat down.  She rushed us and was wrong about how my food was prepared (which was really annoying since i had to remove the toppings from my sandwich), and seemed annoyed that I was even asking her a question.  She was so off-putting that we weren't even comfortable asking her for refills on our drinks (not that she ever came by to ask how we were doing). The other servers were nice and the manager (owner?) came to ask how we were, fortunately.  The food was OK.  I got a Loretta sandwich (had to remove the peppers since I don't like them raw, which is what I asked the waitress about). Tried the brioche french toast and that was good.  My fiancee wasn't too excited about the corned beef hash, which is sad because he loves it.  He said it tasted canned with some added onion.  Overall, I'd never go back.  Much better options in the neighborhood.

Had the best massage I've ever received at this spa!  I got the deep 6 and it had everything I like in a massage, good pressure, stretching and while I felt all worked out, I was still relaxed.  While I would have liked a jacuzzi or sauna in the locker room, the steam room was the most intense I'd ever been in.  I'm glad I got there early so i could go in a bit before the massage and after. And I got to hang out at the hotel pool and jacuzzi after so I was happy.  The robe was luxurious.  The slippers in my locker didn't fit but the girl at the front desk was more than happy to get me a pair that did so no big deal.  The products in the shower were amazing!  Smelled great and were clearly not your typical hotel shampoo/conditioner/body wash.    All in all, not the fanciest spa I've ever been to but definitely one of the best. The cleanliness, service, value and the talent of the therapist are what matter most to me when I go into a spa and I think they shined in all those categories.

Terrible service, rude manager and so-so food.    Thought I was getting a great deal on a pizza and bottle of wine but no deal is worth the annoyance we encountered.  Waited 30 minutes for my waitress to check on me and my order after delivering it and then never got the water I asked for.  Had a couple of friends join us and she still didn't come back for awhile, even though they wanted to order food and drinks as well.  Finally they got served.  I'm in the service industry so I am very understanding when a waitress is slammed but this was in no way a terribly busy night.  Waited a good 45 minutes for the check after we asked for it and it was wrong.  Took another 20 minutes and an argument with the manager before we disgustedly threw down money and just left.    Will NEVER go back.
