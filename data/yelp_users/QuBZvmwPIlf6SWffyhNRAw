My sister, Falin (see below user) found a bridesmaid dress here that she wanted for her wedding.   And out of nowhere, they send her an email this past week saying they were closed and there were no refunds!  This was after several of the bridesmaids already paid for half the dress and some the full amount!  No one is returning our calls in either of their stores in Kentucky or Arizona.  I firmly believe they knew they were closing down and still accepted all of our payments without delivering ANY of the dresses. Plus when I went to be fitted, the girl was rude.

My mom's 50th birthday was yesterday and I needed to send last minute flowers. I found Foothills Floral online and decided to call in my order. The gentleman on the phone with me was so nice and patient while I tried to figure out what I wanted my message to say. The bouquet I ordered was the florist special where they assemble it themselves and choose whatever flowers they like. Ordering flowers that I hadn't seen yet worried me but I trusted them and am happy I did. My mom called me later in the afternoon after receiving the flowers, raving about how good they look and it was beautiful. She also said the smell was so good and strong, it smelled like someone sprayed perfume (they didn't obviously) but they smelled that great!    Def using this company again instead of the commercial online flower sites.  Thanks for making my mom's birthday extra special!
