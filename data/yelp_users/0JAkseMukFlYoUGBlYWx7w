My nails turned out great but they charged me $15 to take off my previous gel because it wasn't done with them. This info was not communicated to me and it is a lot of money!!! My standard get manicure with no massage ended up costing $50.  Sad to say I will not be returning

This was my first visit here.  The place was clean and cute.  The wax was painless ( a touch hot but it's wax right). I had  a my brows, lip and nose done.  Jaime was quick and friendly. Took about 15 minutes.  Did a great job and detailed my brows.  I will be back!
