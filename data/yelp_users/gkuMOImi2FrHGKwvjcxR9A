I booked a storage unit online and was immediately contacted by the great team at Public Storage.  Dave and Juan made sure I had booked the right unit for my needs and scheduled a time for me to come in and see the unit. The day before I was supposed to come in they called to rind me. Their follow up and customer service was excellent

First and foremost, I would like to recognize Larry Love for putting up with us both to and from Tempe Beach Park.  He was such a good sport as I sang "Larry Love, he's a vegetarian" to the tune (well sort of lol) of the Crash Test Dummies song "Mary Moon" at the top of my lungs.... NOT pretty!  The free shuttle service and Larry as our driver are the only positive things I can come up with.   We had room 202.  Our room was dark and dingy even with all of the lights on.  The sofa bed was a joke.  Had it not been 2am and had we not already changed into our jammies before we opened it up, we would have gone down to the front desk and asked for another room.  It's obvious the hotel knew there was a problem with it because they had tried to jerry-rig it with tie wraps but it didn't work.  There was no way to comfortably sleep on it.  The mattress fell through the frame.  We told the gal when we checked out but she didn't seem to care.  Didn't make a note of it either so I'm guessing nothing will be done about it.    The part I am MOST upset with is my daughter lost her iPhone and we were 99.9% sure that it was on the shuttle.  We called the moment we realized it was missing....about 10 minutes after we departed the shuttle and they said it wasn't there.  Then I checked again when we were checking out.  Still nothing.  I gave them my number and said if it turned up to please call me.   She went back over there and asked if SHE could search the shuttle.  They said "well as a matter of fact we did find it about 20 minutes ago but we didn't have a phone number to call anyone."  This was just 2 hours after I had checked out AND left my phone number with them.  Even with insurance on the phone, it's like $150 to replace it.  Would have been beyond angry had we paid that only to find that the phone was on the shuttle as we'd insisted.  The whole experience really made me feel like the hotel didn't give a damn about their customers.

I have been taking cars to Brian for over 20 years and have recommended him to countless family and friends and he never disappoints.  One of the things I love about Brian is his honesty.  For example, when you take your car to him, he will tell you what needs to be done right away vs what needs to be taken care of down the road (pardon the pun). For many of the years I was going to Brian, I was a single mom who had been taken advantage of by other mechanics since I knew nothing abt cars.  Brian's honesty was and is refreshing and greatly appreciated.    My 83 year mom took her car into another shop that she has been going to for longer than I've been going to Brian.  They wanted to do close to $2000 worth of work on a car that isn't even worth that much. My husband and I convinced her to let Brian give her a second opinion.  After he checked it out we learned that not only did it need the $2000 worth of work but once that was corrected, another $1000 or so would be needed almost immediately to correct various other problems. It's just not worth it on a 20 year old car with crazy high mileage  I'm thankful to Brian for helping my mom see that it makes more sense to put that money into buying a newer more reliable car.  The other shop would have just kept pulling more and more money out of my mom and at 83, she certainly doesn't need that!    The bottom line is that if you are looking for someone who is fair, honest, super knowledgeable, reasonably priced as well as incredibly nice, give Brian a call.  You won't be disappointed.

We stayed at the Desert Rose over Labor Day weekend and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We usually stay at a hotel on the strip and it was such a pleasant change not to have to walk through HUGE smoke filled casinos just to get to our room. We visited friends on Saturday at their hotel pool on Saturday and it was so crowded, it would have been difficult to extend your arms and not touch someone. We opted for the Desert Rose pool on Sunday and while almost every chaise was taken, I was the only one in the pool for long periods of time. So relaxing! It was also nice to have a one bedroom suite vs a tiny hotel room. Our friends decided to drive up with us on Friday instead of driving by themselves on Saturday but they hadn't booked a room until Saturday night so it was great to say "just crash on our sofa bed!" It's a very short walk to the MGM and of course from there, you can get everywhere on the strip. Taxis were easy to get (just ask at the front desk) and since it's not far off the strip, the cab fares weren't bad. I'm a night person and didn't get back to our room until 3am - 4am each morning so I was snoozing through the breakfast time....with that, I can't comment on the long lines that I'd read about. The staff was friendly, the resort clean and pretty, the location great.......this is the third Shell Vacations property we've stayed at since we became owners and we were not disappointed! We'll definitely be back!

My daughter and I went here for restaurant week after reviewing dozens of menus.  We'd like an appetizer on one but not the main course or vise versa.  When we saw Ticoz, we wanted one of each appetizer, main course AND dessert!   We truly couldn't decide on the appetizer so we each ordered the Cesar salad with lime chili dressing and then we shared an order of the calamari off the menu with probably the best dipping sauce I've ever had .... it was a jalapeno lime sauce.  YUM!  My daughter had green chili mac and cheese (does it get much better than that?) and it was a HUGE portion.  Most of it went home for her lunch the next day.  I opted for the blue corn enchiladas and they did not disappoint.  They were accompanied by PERFECTLY grilled zucchini....not too mushy, not to crisp.  Delicious!  Each of the dessert choices sounded great but neither of us could resist the Kahlua creme brulee.  I plan to take my husband when we go back to Phoenix to visit in November....it was that good!

I'll be honest, I was NOT thrilled when my husband let me know that his friends from work had chosen this place for dinner. For the most part I think stuff like brats and sausage are GROSS (with the exception of a little hide the sausage. lol) and German food to me just sounded weird with the schnitzels and spatzles and kraut, etc. but I decided I could at least have the cesar salad.  I'm so happy I decided to branch out and try something new.  I had the steak schnitzel (a schnitzel, I learned, is a lean boneless piece of meet ... steak, veal, pork or chicken, breaded and fried) which was covered in a Gorgonzola sauce...it came with a side of German friend potatoes and green beans with bacon/onions.  All of it was very tasty!  I split mine with my hubby and he shared his Schweitzer schnitzel (pork with a layer of ham and swiss cheese) with me.  His came with wirsing which turned out to be a cabbage and cheese dish that sounded awful but tasted great!  The service was wonderful....there were 16 people in our party and we never felt we had to flag anyone down for service.  The place was HUGE but did not appear so from the street and it was completely packed so they must be doing something right! The only thing I'd suggest is that they add a little "glossary" to the front of the menu for those of us (pretty much our whole table) who didn't know what the various dishes were.  That would free up the servers for more important stuff than explaining all those crazy names of dishes!!!!  I wouldn't hesitate to go back.

I stayed here twice on recent trips to Phoenix and had great experiences both times.  We are Shell Vacation Owners and this is our "home" resort but we'd never stayed before and now I'm sorry we never did a stay-cation when we lived in Phoenix because it was great.  I booked a 1-bdrm unit both times and it was huge.  The bedroom was very large and the bed was super comfy, there was a very large Jacuzzi tub in the bathroom as well as a stand up shower and not one but two vanities.....one next to the jacuzzi tub and one in the other part of the bathroom where the shower and toilet were....this would have made it really nice for a  family or couple.   There as a nice sized kitchen with everything I needed for my stay....washer/dryer, dishwasher, stove, microwave, pots, pans, wine glasses, silverware, dishes, etc., a dining room with a table that seated 6 (which I ended up needing when family visited) and a living room with a sofa bed....oh and flat screen tvs with DVD players in both the living room and the bdrm.  Also, you either have a nice balcony or patio with chaise lounges which was really nice in the evenings.   The pool is really big with plenty of chaise lounges as well as tables and chairs with umbrellas.  It wasn't crowded either stay (tho I know this is low season in PHX).  I can't say enough about the staff....they were so polite and friendly and even remembered me when I came back the second time.  Though I didn't partake because with family living in PHX, I was gone a lot, there seemed to be plenty of activities for guests and the spa was having some great specials....next time, maybe!

I was only going to give it 1 star but the bread (especially the pretzel bread and the olive bread) and wine were at least good!  My friend and I are on a quest to find the best tuna tartar in the valley....why?  Well, why not, I guess!  She'd googled something like "best tuna tartar" and City Hall came up in her search.  So sad it did because I wish I had my time and money back.  They need to send someone over to The Mint to see how tuna tartar should be made!  The price for the tuna tartar was $18 which I'd HAPPILY pay if it was GOOD but it was awful!  Instead of a nice bowl of tender delicious tuna like we had at The Mint, we got a tri-level blob on our plate.  The bottom layer was what I believe were crushed up chow mein noodles of some sort....bland and boring!  The next layer, which was about 3/4 of the blob, was guacamole....WEIRD!  And it wasn't even a nice bold flavorful guac!  Like the chow mein noodles, it was bland and boring.  Then in a VERY thin layer smeared on the top were some small pieces of raw tuna.  And guess what?  It was bland and boring too!  No surprise there, huh?  So we very disappointed to say the least.  We also opted to try the seared ahi tuna.  Another mistake!  I've eaten a LOT of ahi in my life (Salt Cellar always has beautiful ahi!!) and when I order seared ahi, I expect it to be put on a very hot grill for just a moment and then turned over for another moment and then off so that the inside is still nice and raw.  Everywhere I've had seared ahi from one side of the US to the other has been prepared that way.  At City Hall it was cooked all the way through and it really ruined it for me.  It almost seemed as if we were eating canned tuna.  Not impressed!  We would have complained to our server if we ever saw her!  I was finally able to flag her down and get our bill but by then, we didn't have time to say anything as we needed to leave.  Kudos to the valet at least! I couldn't find my ticket and was searching my purse for it when all of a sudden my friend said "hey, he's got your car already!"   The place was pretty full so I was pretty impressed that he remember what car we were driving.....  Onward and upward to our next stop on our tuna tartar tasting tour.....

I've been going to Laveen Nails since they very first opened and have never ever had a bad experience.  We moved to Verrado (Buckeye) a year ago and we still try to make it over there at least every 4 - 6 weeks because I've yet to find anywhere that even comes close to being as good in this price range.  My husband and I both get pedis and a massage (either full body or reflexology) and I also get a fill.  I love that it has grown and expanded since they first opened.  A testament, in my opinion, to the great services they provide and the excellent team that works there.

This was my second trip to The Mint and I'm happy I went back.  My first time was with about 8 other ladies during restaurant week and one of my friends and I had the tuna tartar and it was to die for!  We recently decided we were going to go on a quest for the best tuna tartar in the valley so we went back to The Mint to give it a second try and see if it was just as delish the second time and it was even BETTER than what we remember.  We each got a nice sized bowl served with prawn crackers (I love listening to them crackle and pop....even more than rice crispies!!) so as not to dilute the flavor of the tuna tartar.  The tuna tartar was mixed with diced onion, cucumber, ginger and some spicy chili sauce.  It tasted wonderfully fresh and the combination of the ginger with the chili was awesome!  The Mint used to be a bank apparently and the drinks were all named something "banky" (is that a word?).  I had The Jefferson and it was so incredibly yum!  Effen cucumber vodka, mint and something else tasty that I can remember...tonic maybe?  Who cares...it was great!  From there we went to Maestro's City Hall (awful, but that's another review) so now our quest hs turned into finding a tuna tartar BETTER than The Mint.  They've set the bar pretty high!

wow!  after reading the other lackluster reviews I had to wonder if we ate at the same place!  I used to eat at the original Raul & Theresa's when I lived in the valley back in the 80s.  My hubby and I happened to notice this one on Litchfield and decided to give it a try.  We were VERY impressed with EVERYTHING!  The salsa was very fresh and really tasty.  Our server was excellent!  He brought us a small bowl of the Theresa's special and their green chile to try.  The meat in both, was so incredibly tender that it just fell apart when we tried to pick it up with a fork and both were VERY flavorful.  i opted for a combo that included an enchilada and a green chile burro and was NOT disappointed.  The spanish rice was delish.  My husband had a combo that included 2 cheese enchiladas, a beef tamale, and a taco.  The taco wasn't fantastic but it wasn't bad either.  The beef tamale was great, though.  The beef had a great taste to it and there was plenty of it (unlike a tamale he'd had before at another mexican food restaurant where he had to "hunt" for signs of meet inside the tamale).  The waiter had mentioned that he had a "surprise" for my husband.  I figured that meant he was going to give him a little sample of their desserts or something like he had with their entrees but what he'd done is replace one of the cheese enchiladas with a green chile enchilada because my husband expressed how delicious it was.  Talk about going above and beyond!  We will definitely go back!
