How disappointing. Went to have a family meal here before going to a show. We walked in and saw several tables open. Hostess said it would be a 5 minute wait to get a table wiped down. We stood for awhile...waiting. Waiting. Kids getting antsy so we sat on a bench to wait.  Kept waiting. Another group of 4 people came in after us, put their name in. Then the hostess SAT them at one of the tables. Hello??  We asked the hostess why she sat them first and she stumbled a little bit then said "I don't know."  We left and went across to smash burger.

The waiter was incredibly rude and impatient. He walked away AS we were ordering. We complained to the manager who came out to watch/babysit the waiter. Got a new waitress who was soooooo sweet(left her a good tip). Food was disgusting.  Won't be back ever again.

Such a cute little tea party!  We came with a bunch of little girls and they felt so special. My little one was sooooo excited to be at a "real" tea party.

We drive out way out of the way to take our cars here. We refer all of our friends to them as well. Bruce and his staff are the most ethical people we have met. They don't try to price gouge like most places and they are up front with what needs to be done and what can wait. Their prices are better than other places we have been to. If you have another problem you are worried about, they'll check it out and give you an honest opinion. Bruce really cares for his customers and it's apparent that he loves what he does. He is involved in his community and serves on the board of a nonprofit that my husband and I were part of. His same ethics in business shine through as a board member and mentor to the nonprofit. We are grateful to have met Bruce and will always drive out of our way to bring our cars to him.

This is our favorite pizza place!  When it's my son's birthday, we always let him pick what he wants and he always wants Stevie's. Today when we picked up the pizzas, they left him a super sweet message on the boxes. Totally made his day!!  Thanks for the yummy pizza and making his dad so special!!!

Wow!  Just wow!  I have a small side business....One of my customer orders was supposed to come to my house on a certain day but was somehow routed to the wrong post office and would not have been delivered on time for my customer's bday. I called my post office (on 59th) to see if they could do anything. The gal on the phone (wish I remembered her name) tracked down the package at the other location and sent someone to go pick it i!!!  I'll be getting the package later today and will make it over to my customer in time for her birthday dinner. Thank you thank you USPS!  Great location. Always very helpful. This was a great example of amazing customer service.

Revolving Sushi Fun! We go here on a weekly basis for lunch. It's super fast, great service, endless supply of cheap sushi. Definitely better than what we make at home. :) They are constantly trying to add new things to their menu.  Everything is fresh for the most part. The only thing I've seen that wasn't was the edamame - but I've seen the same problem at upscale restaurants in Scottsdale.  I've never had a problem with the temperature of the sushi and we come here about once a week.  Service is great. I love my wasabi and the girl happily brings me more.  My kids are in love with sushi because of this place. They are excited to eat sushi at Kiku but won't eat it anywhere else. :) We are loyal customers!  Great place for fast and basic sushi. If you want the fancier stuff, you won't get as much of that here.

Called when we were less than a mile away to check on the wait. They wouldn't take our name for the list (understandable) but assured it was a 10 minute wait. We showed up less than 2 minutes later, get the kids unloaded from the car, walk in and they tell us it's a 50 minute wait. GRRRR. I like the food but they need to work on their communication.

New owners are amazing!!  Old reviews should be updated. I hope Yelp can figure that out.   Phoenix Phreeze truck is adorable. It's very clean on the inside and out. Love the lights they added to the outside along with high stools and a grass umbrella for shade. Too cute. Service is great, now run by a very sweet family. Ice is delicious and drinks are very cold.  They even sell fun snacks and candy. Call them for your next event!!
