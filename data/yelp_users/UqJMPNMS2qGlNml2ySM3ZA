So we came in as a buddy said you have to try this place the El pastor rocks! I said ok Ill try it. Wow not good!  First off I have to give them a 4 for service. Would have got a 5 but I had to ask for my chips after waiting 5 min. I mean really I have to wait then remind you to give them to me. First Fail!  Got our food and I was not impressed at all when it came to the meat. NO I mean NO flavor in the El Pastor. I mean really Guy Fieri Has been here. This was horrible. How can any one say its good. My partner ordered chicken. it was OK until she got a large BONE! I mean really a bone!!!!  The manager could only say "Oh we try and check for that but oh so sorry" This was all you could say? I mean pay for our meal make it better dont change the subject and talk about the kids. FAIL! You own this place and want people to return? Not like this you wont. You fail here and BAD!  I will never come back here or recommend any one eating here!

Crazy place. Get there early there is always a line. Its a bar and grill so every things a bit pricey. Get your drinks in the casino first. Food quality well I ordered my favorite Buffalo chicken sandwich.  When I got it it tasted old and a strange crunchy taste to it so I sent that back. I had a been burrito and that was just as good as taco bell. The live bands are cool. That was about it.  I dont see my self going back. :(

Not big on this place. Here is why.  Service was crap. He took forever to say hi to us. He was never around. Seemed like he was new.  Food was just ok. My french dip was fresh but no flavor. I have had better and with taste. I wanted beer and filled when I finished. Never happend. I had to ask when I could find him.  I wont return here. Fail.

Great food and I love the cajan fries!!! Service was great and finding a coke was crazy with the selection. Only bad thing here is you'll spend a lot. Its way over priced. 34.00 for a two drinks 3 burgers and 1 fry's.  They need to lower the prices. All around great place. Place was clean and service was great.

Came here twice. Every time the staff was nice. Life guards are a little freaky. I mean really do you have to turn around and stare at me every min? Not one life guard but all of them! Kinda creeper ish  OMG its freaking me out thinking about it! STOP!  Other than that it was a great place to hang and swim.  STOP LOOKING AT ME!

I needed a drink so I came here. Service was ok nothing great. Hell the guy was not even happy to be there. Seemed lost really. Drinks are always high priced at the airport but what can you do. food was just ok not even good.   Over all food was not good and service not at all what it could be. I wont come here again.
