Always loved this place. Especially the corn bread which is the best you can get in town. Get nacho chips with three dip salsa and gauc for appetizers.   Recently had the Fish Tacos and it tasted amazing with pieces of mango and tomato.  For desert: Ancho chili Fudge just makes me dreamy.  If you wanna take a girl to a place with good food and great ambiance this is your spot.

Best beers you can get in the valley.  Kiltlifter, SunBru, 8th Street, Peach Ale you can't go wrong with any of these.

Bar tender takes $20 and gives back $5 when I ordered a drink worth $4.50.  It was my bad that I didn't count when I took it. Just be careful when you go here.

Lunch or Dinner doesn't matter I am here close to 3 out of 7 days in a week. My personal favorites are: Thai pineapple fried rice, Hot Korean, Malaysian and Tott's fried rice. The food is amazing and the service is fast.

This used to be our hangout of choice for UFC fights but the owner would lay down a table next to the restroom entrance if he could manage it. The service is atrocious. The food is decent. Avoid this place if you have other places to watch UFC

Ordered a beet and aragula salad because I love beets. Turns out there are about 6 thinly sliced pieces of beet and the rest is a bunch of arugula. Felt like a goat eating it. The waitress was good but the rest of the staff acted like they hated life.

Always a fun time with friends over here. The fish tacos taste amazing and the bar has a really good vibe. One of the best places to enjoy the great weather of Arizona.

Good music to dance to but too ghetto for my tastes. In addition, after you pay a cover and go in you can't go out and come back in. You have to pay the cover again. That's gotta be one of the stupidest thing I ever heard.

Delicious homemade fruit ice creams and fresh fruit juices! Feels like I died and went to heaven. Love this place and my friends have a hankering for it all the time.

Large selection of beer and very laid back ambience. Perfect for a relaxing saturday night with good friends. Would give it 5 stars if I didn't have to setup my own corn hole boards. How hard is it for them to already have it setup so I don't have to do the hard work?

The open space, the ambience, the buzz - there is so much to love about this place. Always have a great time when I go with my friends. The food and beer are a little bit expensive. However, the salmon dish with asparagus and risotto is delicious and I don't mind paying more for that.
