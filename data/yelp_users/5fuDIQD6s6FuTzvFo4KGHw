I have been coming here for years. They are never pushy, the doctor is really great and knowledgeable. They work with you and your situation. I never feel like I'm being rushed or taken advantage of. I've had really bad experiences with dental and vision places since I've lived in Phoenix, and this place is by far the best vision place I've been. The staff is really nice and helpful too.

These guys are amazing. I've taken my puppy Copper there since we had him. They've vaccinated him, neutered him and now taken care of him with kennel cough. They are extremely welcoming, great customer service, don't over-charge or over-diagnose, very knowledgeable and willing to answer my many questions and always willing to help. I just moved to south Chandler, but am more than happy to drive the distance for the quality service we get here. Highly recommend for any pet!

I've had some horrific experiences with dental offices and crooked dentists. Anything from taking my money to one even suggesting I fudge insurance information to get me/them more money. But, Whiting Dental has been amazing. I've been coming here for several years now. And although I live even further away (South Chandler), I still drive all the way out because I know they'll take care of me. Dr. Whiting has fixed mistakes for free, never over charged, only done the work that was actually needed and approved by myself, never pushy for payments (I always pay upfront anyways). I'll drive 30 minutes for good service and quality. Everyone from Whiting, to the assistants and the hygienists are top notch.

I have long had lower back pain, and as of the past year, had major neck/shoulder pain. I saw a chiropractor last year, but it was a temporary fix. My doctor referred me here for physical therapy on my back and neck. Dr. Severson has been amazing. She's very detailed in what is happening and why I've been hurting. We started out with a few exercises and built my way up to many more. Now, two weeks later my pain is almost completely gone. It's been so helpful to learn about my ailment as well as learn how to manage it and make it better. Hands down best decision to finally break down and go see a doctor, because now I am so close to being completely pain free. The whole staff here are amazing!

They were quick to answer and resolve our sudden bee infestation on the front of our house.  I was travelling at the time, so my wife came home to a thousand bees swarming the front door. They did a fantastic job getting rid of the bees and closing the section of the stucco where the hive was. I can't speak for pricing as I didn't really shop around much because of the time sensitive urgency, but it was worth it in my opinion.

I go to Rock Bottom all the time at my companies main office in California, so to find out there's one in Phoenix (although I live in Chandler, FAR away from the actual Rock Bottom), my wife and I were in the area this weekend and couldn't resist. I love this place. Great beers, even better food. The 2am burger can't be beat. The waiter literally handmade the rootbeer. It took him a couples tries to get it right for my wife, but he did it with a smile on his face and wasn't annoyed. One of the best brewery's I go to.

I wanted to give it a while before posting. Our last OB doctor's office was horrible and w had a very traumatic miscarriage with little to no concern on their behalf. Dr. Huish is the exact opposite. From the beginning, he reassured us that everything was alright, the baby was well and so was mamma. He always had answers, never pressured us and always was polite and courteous. The staff there is great too. We never seemed like a burden. The ultrasound tech were amazing also, especially the lady with longer hair (forgot her name). Now, after the birth of our first child, Dr. Huish was fantastic during the delivery. Basically lived at the hospital towards the end of the labor. He gave realistic expectations and suggestions, ultimately leading to us choosing the vacuum pump to get our son out. And he did it perfectly. We love this office and Dr. Huish and highly recommend anyone else. In fact my wife's sister in law and family now go too.

I'm not one to complain, but to possibly help another not make a horrible mistake, here goes. We went against our better judgment upon reviews when we moved in, almost two years ago. Bad reviews, horrible service, etc. Well, if the shoe fits...they were awful. Alliance properties is a mess and very dishonest and not caring. The management staff turned over quicker than a fast food joint. I think I met at least 3-4 different property managers while I was there, and who knows how many I didn't meet.   Upon move-in, they didn't have our fabs or storage key ready. In fact they didn't seem to remember we signed up for a storage unit. They got us a key. It was a second floor unit, which was wrong. We eventually got it right, on a first floor.   The "phantom charges" in previous posts are 100% true. A "mandatory" $25 for some stupid trash service. I'm a 30 ear old guy. I can take my own trash out. What a waste of $25 that I tried to refute but was unable to. The "community fees" for gas and electricity and water for community areas is bogus. I've lived in many apartments and never heard of these fees. Isn't that what RENT is for? They never mentioned ANY of these fees upon walk through. In the summer time my rent was close to $100 more because of these fees; NOT BUDGETED. Meaning we were basically, dishonestly robbed of $100 that I didn't have and couldn't get out of it. They certainly didn't care the least that people were troubled by this. We were even threatened with a $50 fee for leaving the "mandatory" trash bin outside our apartment all day. Sorry San Cierra, like I wasn't busy at all during the day. I heard many people talking to the managers about these and they simply said they couldn't do anything. Get a clue Alliance.   "Luxury Apartment"? Right. The front gate was broke and permanently open for the first 5-6 months we lived there. At NO TIME, did any of the main pools gates all work at the same time. One was always chained off or broken. The Six gas grills around the main pool; only 1 igniter worked and maybe 2 that were "clean" enough to cook on. Half of them were so caked with poor maintenance and bad apartment dwellers that the heat didn't even rise to the food.  After our first year, literally because we were in a job transition and didn't want to move, we renewed. The management came back a few weeks later with a new renewal notice saying we had to tell them if we were moving or not and had passed the 60 days. Somehow between the corporate Alliance and the main office of the apartment, no communication and they finally "found" my renewal. I almost wanted to say screw it and leave, but just couldn't unfortunately.   Even when moving out, no one had a clue. I emailed them through their own Alliance website and payment page, and it never made it to the main office, so again, they thought we weren't responding about our 60 notice. Then we were told we had to give a date of move out, then we were told we didn't. Literally between the constant new staff, no one had a clue about anything in that office.  Even locationally, this place is terrible. A fatal shooting at the Walmart down the road, multiple robberies and break-ins through the neighboring houses and apartments. Cops constantly around or in the apartments looking for people. It's a shady area with shady people and is no way luxury.  Long story short, horrible service, horrible company, horrible apartments, horrible people living in the apartments, in no way shape or form luxury, dishonest, too high of turnover in management and staff and no care. How can a company flat out not care about it's people? Don't ever consider moving here.

Hands down, best brewery in Arizona. The kilt lifter is easily the best beer I've ever tasted. Their food is amazing too. The French dip is the best in Phoenix and the big Jim fries are a southwestern staple. Great service and atmosphere also.

My wife and I came here for our anniversary this past weekend and it was fantastic. The tea selection was quite large, and very good. The lunch was delicious and the scones were amazing. The scone dipping sauces really made it perfect. Reasonably priced. Good service. Very nice and quaint place. It was great!

We stopped by for a quick snack before more casino fun. The free nuts and popcorn was fun and tasty and we got a few drinks and chocolate covered strawberries. We sat by the piano while a guy was playing live and people watched. Great atmosphere to relax before a long night ahead. Decently priced and good service.

This place was amazing. Very expensive, but on a special occasion, it was a perfect place. My ribeye was one of the best steaks I've ever had, as was the twice baked potato. My wife had the Alaskan king crab legs, and it was literally 3 giant legs, already half shelled. Amazing. Good dessert, great selection of scotch and fancy drinks and presentations for plates. The ambiance was great too. You could tell it was all fancy. Service was good. Definitely don't come if you are in a rush. We were there for over 2 hours, but we never felt like we were waiting. It was a "good" 2 hours. Unless you're super rich and you know it, I'd hold off wearing jeans and tennis shoes. This place is too fancy for normal attire. Slacks and a nice shirt or polo would do fine.

Sorry for the length in advance, but since the office literally has no email to contact them to address issues, this public forum is my outlet to voice my concern and extreme dissatisfaction for this office's staff, assistant's and complete lack of care, sympathy, knowledge and professionalism.  **First of all, Dr. Kale and the nurse that draws blood were amazing. The ONLY good parts about this entire office.**  This was my wife and I's first pregnancy, and subsequently our first miscarriage. I have only gone to this office three times, but from the first moment I walked in, was not impressed, but for the sake of my wife and our excitement of now being pregnant, didn't say much. Whoever decided to board up the receptionists desk and allow the office assistants to casually sit cross legged on a chair with iPads, seemingly upset that people walk in and make them get up, was a horrible decision. Lacks professionalism. I get the whole Apple modern thing, but this is a professional medical office. Big difference. I did not feel comfortable or taken care of from day one. It was like walking into a retail store with minimum wage clerks with attitudes forced to get off the chair and greet us.   The first two visits were ok. Confirmed we were pregnant, my wife drew blood, had an ultrasound, couldn't see anything because it was too early.   But the third visit is what ruined our relationship. First of all, the office didn't even schedule my wife (though they gave us a card with the date and time on it). So from the moment she came in, she appeared like an inconvenience to them. It was obviously they were trying to rush her through everything. So she sat and waited. I'm sure Dr. Kale wasn't even told about our situation. My wife waited as they "found time to fit her in"....even though they already scheduled her to come in that day (and didn't schedule it). She finally got in to the ultrasound room. The lady was extremely rough with her. Then towards the end, my wife asked her if she saw anything or heard a heartbeat. The technician responded with a non-too subtle or compassionate, "I see no pregnancy". Left it at that. So now my wife and mother in law are left to wait for the doctor (who knows how long since she again, wasn't scheduled correctly) in nervous anticipation.  They send another doctor in. She basically tells my wife of the miscarriage. She didn't really give her any other information as to how to handle it, what to do next or any follow up appointments necessary. Nothing. She then said my wife could do another pee pregnancy test to confirm. My wife did. And waited. And waited. This is when I arrived. I was at the dentist getting a crown, so I was already tired and frustrated. We waited longer. Finally, my mother in law went out to ask. She was greeted with these unbelievable comments. "Oh, no one has come in yet? Yeah, she's not pregnant. You can go now".   Amazing. No compassion. No sympathy. Not one person in that office had the decency or care in the world to come talk to my wife and me and explain what had happened or even the results of the new test. Then, we were swiftly escorted to the door, again reaffirming our "inconvenience" to them by coming in unscheduled (remember then did schedule us and screwed up?).   This office has no professionalism. Not one person showed any medical training or customer service. They were rough, non-caring and frankly, didn't show any interest whatsoever in my wife's condition or situation.   Since Goodman & Partridge has no email to contact the office manager and I certainly don't want to call, because that will be an unpleasant phone call for them. I am doing this review. We are never coming back to this office, nor if any of my family or relatives. We are currently searching out new doctors and offices. Judging by other Yelp reviews, this office is just terrible. If Dr. Kale ever starts her own practice, we will be the first in line to join her, as she was the only good thing about this unprofessional and rude office. I sincerely hope someone from the G&P office sees this, addresses my concerns, cleans house and makes some changes. I would never in my life wish the service we got on any other woman in the world. This was supposed to be the happiest time of our lives, and it turned a sad situation 10 times worse with terrible service and professionalism.

This is a great Home Depot. The customer service is fantastic. I just moved into a new home, and I've had questions on anything from gardening to pest control to lumber to tools and paint. Their workers are extremely knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. It's definitely my go to place for help and supplies.

Great place to go. Good selection of beer. I love the wheat beer the best. Good food to. Right up there with 4 Peaks quality, but closer to my home and doesn't feel as "college party-esque" and a bit more older in nature, which I like. Parking is always tough in that area and the wait is long on weekends, but par for the course in Phoenix.

We stopped in for just some quick appetizers before a long night ahead. The chips and salsa were great and the mini chimichangas or whatever were actually really good. For the price, good service and ease of this place during lunch time, it was pretty fantastic. I've also came here before by myself for dinner and it was equally as good.

The place looked great. Very unique and Paris decorated. But really slow service. Slow...for a crepe. The dough used wasn't very good either. Too thick and doughy, not very sweet. Won't be back to this place.

This place is amazing. Great food and even better atmosphere. Not the quickest service by any means, but always nice and pleasant. Seriously, the food is great. I'm not big on veggies, but out of the 4 or 5 pasties I've had (most with veggies), it's still beyond delicious. I wish they made pasties to order, but I understand the quantity they make. This particular location is one of my wife and my favorite places to go.

Amazing food. Just moved into the area and was looking for our Chinese place of choice, and we found it on the first try. Their food was amazing. They have a great selection and really good prices, and to top it off a wanton egg drop soup, which is the best of both worlds!

I've sent my wife several times for the 4 hour facial, massage, manicure, pedicure and lunch deal. She loves it. We've done couples massage here too and it was incredible. The facility is nice, great staff and support and really feels fancy. It's pricey, but well worth it.

We had our first child here. We've heard horror stories about friends and other facilities, so needless to say we were a little nervous. But starting at the hospital tour, the lady giving it was fantastic. She answered my MANY questions and and was full of good advice and suggestions. Come delivery day, we were induced right before our actual due date. Everyone involved did an amazing job. Literally, anyone who came into our room was professional, pleasant, courteous, helpful, kind, thoughtful and did anything we asked without frowning or second thought. Especially Fayza. We ran her ragged, asking her to move my wife's position every 15 minutes or so and needing more pain meds and such. She did it with a smile on her face and with as much energy as the beginning of her shift. And she even stayed past her shift to see our son born. All our nestiticians (sp) were great. The guy who did the epidural was informative and wasn't bothered by me watching and asking questions. Dr. Huish was fantastic and was there for us and gave us good advice, options and suggestions, ultimately leading to us choosing the vacuum to get our son out. Worked perfectly! Too many names to remember or name, but Dorothy, Fayza, Julie, Angelica, our lactation consultants, the female onsite pediatrician, Carol, Susanne and Lynn all were so helpful, positive and courteous. They were never bothered by our needs and demands. I don't think I could have imagined a better first experience. Cheers to all the maternity ward folks and I hope they enjoyed their Oh Henry bars!!

They were quick and easy to work with. A gentleman came out for a survey and told me exactly what was needed regarding my tree in my backyard. He quoted me and scheduled it right away. I was travelling at the time, so I returned with the tree already done and they did a fantastic job and even cleared all the dead brush underneath. I can't speak for pricing as I didn't really shop around much, but it was worth it in my opinion.

We only saw Dr. Carter once, briefly and he was honest with us about our newborn needing to laser his frenulum. Our sister in law and other family members use him, so he came highly regarded and I appreciate he didn't try to force a procedure or be in it for the money. He knew our situation and was very informative and courteous. Although our son is only a month old, as soon as he has teeth, Dr. Carter will be our dentist for the foreseeable future.

My wife and I came here for our anniversary breakfast. It was very good. Unusual, in that the fillings (banana, strawberry and nutella) were put on tops instead of inside. But, it tasted great none the less. The service was good, the atmosphere was nice and quaint and relaxing. I've tried some other creperies in the valley and this place is by far my favorite.

It's been a little over a week since they sprayed. I've seen one scorpion since, and it was up on a wall...assuming it was getting away from the spray on the ground and border. The prayer showed up on time, was nice and polite and answered all my questions and was un-annoyed by my dog and I following him while he worked asking questions and watching. The price was good, and a bit less than some of the other companies I researched and called, so I guess we'll see if you get what you paid for. But, so far so good.  Side note...my dog (small puggle around 20 pounds) did randomly get sick about three days after spraying. He vomited about 15 times within 30 minutes. We took him to the vet and couldn't really pinpoint what it was. He's been fine since. Not sure if it was the spray or not; he doesn't normally lick the floor or walls, so not sure at all.

We were referred her, to Dr. Cimenello by two friends with multiple kids. Our newborn is now a month old and he took care of our newborn checkup, frenulum snip, circumcision and Dr. Johnson did our one month checkup. They have been overly fantastic. Very informative and had an answer to our MANY questions. They don't try to do too much, and are very reassuring to some of our prior worries. I'm so glad we found a perfect fit on our first try with our new son.

I'm so glad I got referred here from my brief trip to Chandler Regional ER. I only saw Dr. Krahn once, but he had all the right answers, and for the first time have found true relief on my foot pain. He showed me my x-rays and described what really has been happening and my diagnosis. He recommended certain brands of shoes and sandals to help support my feet the way I needed them. It was an expensive fix, as I bout all new shoes and sandals and house shoes, but I've literally felt no pain at all since I made these changes. Thanks so much for making me pain free Dr. Krahn!!

I was referred to K9 Day Out by another referral. It was the first time we've ever left our dog to be boarded. y wife and I were both a little nervous, because we weren't sure how he'd be with other dogs. Our dog is really clingy and used to humans, not other dogs. But Danielle did a great job easing my nerves, answering questions and giving me peace that my dog would be fine. And, he did. He had a great day and played well. K9 felt homey and comfortable and perfect for my dog to visit and stay overnight. I definitely recommend them. They were great and I will be returning.

Really great place. Nice lunch deals with a slice and wings. Pizza was delicious and my wife's Philly cheesesteak was good too. Good prices, especially for the lunch deals. Boneless wings were different (breading I think) but had good flavor.

We took a chance here. It's a hole in the wall, standard strip mall/shopping mall location. No bells or whistles. But, definitely a unique place, especially with the moonshine varieties and different types of food. The bacon mac and cheese was fantastic. The mixed drinks (some with moonshine) were great. Grilled cheeses were a hit too. Cool place to go for a unique bite to eat. The ambiance isn't the best. There are plenty more festive or unique environments decor wise, but all in all this place was great.

So so. I've been twice now with my wife and both times it was just mediocre at best. I appreciate the "from scratch", but the taste and quality just didn't pop out. We gave it a second try, but not sure we'll be back. Just not very good food.

The price is great. They have my name and record in their system so they know immediately how I like my hair done. They're always quick, polite and nice to talk to. I've had nothing but good experiences here. Been coming to this particular location for about a year now, since I moved in the neighborhood.

My wife and I came here this past weekend as part of our anniversary fun. It was an amazing place. We walked around for probably 2 hours or more. It had so much. Plus we're looking for decor and ideas for our soon to be baby nursery, so even though we didn't purchase anything, we came away with a lot of fantastic ideas for me to make. We actually wanted to buy an end table. Came back about 20 minutes later to get it and it was gone :-( My advice for the next one, in May 2016, if you want it, get it. Otherwise it'll be gone!  Side note...not sure why we had to pay for parking as well as entry tickets. $21 isn't much total, but to just walk and peruse...my two cents.

On the better side of Chinese buffets. Not as much variety as I've seen, but I don't like sushi and they had a lot of that. Good food though. All the varieties of chicken were great and the egg drop soup was good.
