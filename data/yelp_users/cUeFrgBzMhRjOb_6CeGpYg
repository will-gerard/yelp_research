This place is a favorite among my boyfriend's family and it's definitely become a favorite of mine. We try to make it a point to go here for breakfast at least once a month. Their bagels are the best in Phoenix! They put the toppings not only on the top, but on the bottom of the bagel, so no matter what side you eat, you're getting topping goodness. The service can be slow, but it always ends up being worth it.

The customer service at this location is ALWAYS on point. There is one guy in particular (must learn name on next visit) who is always so nice and entertaining. They were out of kit kat tonight (first time that's ever happened), but I couldn't even stay mad.

I pulled up in a my car with my seat looking like a barf bag (PADP - People Against Drunk Passengers) and the guys were great! They thoroughly cleaned my entire car and paid close attention to the aforementioned seat. I got my car looking and smelling like new in under 45 minutes all for $40, you can't beat that! 5 stars for making mark car smell like new.

Coffee is very good AND they have almond milk! Love it. Their tea looks excellent too. I'll definitely be going back.

This is officially my new go-to auto shop. I took my recently-purchased, used car here for my first maintenance on it and they were extremely helpful. I'm the type of person who need honest people who will tell me straight what's going on with my car and that's exactly what I got, and for $46! You can't beat that. I love this place!

I've been here a few times, trying something different each time and I've NEVER been disappointed. My boyfriend and I split a California roll out of the case and it was some of the best sushi we've had. The open-faced Croque Madame is a must try as well!

I love this place! Great Hot & Sour soup, excellent fried wontons and the staff is so nice. My boyfriend and I get take out from here all the time and the front lady is always very welcoming.

They have Manapua! The girl told us it's hit or miss on whether or not they have it, but we got lucky. I also got the Kalbi plate which was a bit overpriced and very fatty, but had some of the best flavor! Just a heads up - bring cash for a tip, their card machine doesn't let you add it on.

I love me some Chompies! My father is Jewish, so I grew up with Hamentachen cookies, knishes and Matzaball soup and this place is just like grandma made it! Even if you aren't a fan of those thing, they have something for everyone on their menu. And their bagels are amazing! Try their monte cristo sandwich, you will love it.

My boyfriend and I love this place! It's a bit of a hole in the wall, but these are always the best places anyway! We get #22 and a #50 to split. If you're a picky eater, probably not the place for you, but if you like Vietnamese, this is one of the best places in Phoenix.

This is a beautiful theater. Just went and heard David Doubilet and Jennifer Hayes speak about underwater photography and there can't be a bad seat in the house! I could see and hear everything perfectly despite being in the upper left hand corner off to the side. Great talk, great theater and the people who work here are so nice and helpful. Two thumbs up!

The moment I walked into Canine Preferred, I fell in love! They let the dogs run around and play Instead of locking them in cages. My dog, Shep, loved it! The owner, Diane is awesome, the grooming staff is really good with the dogs and the prices are very reasonable - Shep is a 60lb Blue Tick Coonhound and other places were going to charge me $60, but they charged $35 for the whole kit and kaboodle! I will definitely be making Canine Preferred my permanent groomer! Just a heads up - they only take cash or check, no charge.

This place is way over priced and not worth it. I will admit, I've never dined in, only gotten take out, but I've payed out the wazoo and wasn't ever pleased.

I have been going to Chino's since I was a little kid! I love it and take all out-of-town visitors here. Try the Jade Red Chicken w/ Jerk fried rice and black beans - you won't regret it!

This mountain will kick your butt! I hike it every weekend and it has helped me with my cardio, stamina and maintain a healthy weight. Definitely wear shoes with some traction or you'll slip and slide all the way down. For your first few times, make sure you allot a couple hours - you'll want to take is slow. It's pretty much straight up the whole time, but when you make it to the top, you'll feel amazing.

This is my boyfriend and I's go-to place for Sunday breakfast. We haven't met anything on the menu we didn't like. The service is great, they make you feel like part of the Acacia Cafe family. On Sundays they have a special menu, which has the Albuquerque Benedict, one of my favorites! Definitely go back multiple times so you can try everything out. It's well worth it.

I've been here a few time before during the summer and always have a blast at their many pools. This was the first time I've been here during the winter and it's much more muted. My boyfriend took me here for our 2-year anniversary and it was a very relaxing, romantic staycation! Definitely would recommend this place for a low-key winter night and for a fun time during the summer.

My boyfriend and I went here for his sister's birthday. The place is just okay in my opinion, but he was not a fan and said the bathrooms were gross. Overall, not impressed and we probably won't be going back.

This my family and I's go-to spot when we need fast, good food. The waitresses (yes, they are all chicks) are always very nice and on top of it, which in sports bars really is a toss up. Good food, fast service, nice staff - good place to go.

I love the customer service here! I work for a company called EXOS and we have pretty much replaced our old vendor with BrandX because of the quick turnarounds and great service. I would definitely recommend to other businesses, my coworkers, and even a friend.

This place is AMAZING! I go with my family every year for one of our birthdays and the customer service is always great, the food is amazing and it's all around fun. My tip is to try a small portion of everything and don't over eat at the salad bar. The cheese bread and plantains are bottomless and to die for! Don't forget dessert - I'm not a fan of flan, but man is it good here! It's expensive and completely worth every penny.

I love Akihana! This is hands down my favorite sushi place in Phoenix. They have an amazing selection of sushi rolls and a wide variety of extras to try out - luke the frog legs (give em a try, you won't be sorry). The service is great and the bar tenders are hilarious! Try a panty dropper - it's a martini with sea urchins in it, unless you got shit to do later, it will mess you up!

I love me some Paradise Bakery cookies, but the staff here has such a bad attitude! They never smile and always have this look like you are burdening them with your presence. I used to work at a Paradise Bakery when I was in high school and my former boss would be raising hell if he saw these guys' sorry attitudes. Go for the food - but don't expect much from the service.

This was my first time in and the first thing I noticed was the excellent customer service. Ryan greeted me, gave me suggestions, brought me water even though I didn't ask and was all around pleasant. He suggested the Rustic Chicken Club and it was awesome! I'll definitely be going back.

The food here was great, but the reason this place gets 5 stars is all because of Nicole S.!! She was on top of everything and was so accommodating. She had us laughing like no tomorrow. Definitely request her when you go in!   Side note - the American Mules are out of this world!

I LOVE this place! I get my nails done by Linda Ha, eyebrows by Linda (?), I've gotten my hair done by Annie, and had laser hair removal by Dee, the owner. Every experience has been amazing! It's a one-stop shop for all my beauty needs. I definitely recommend checking this place out. You won't be sorry.

Happy hour at Stingray blows me away. It's normally a very expensive sushi place, so it's great that they offer such a great mix of things on their list. They have some of the best yellowtail sashimi in town and I love me some quail eggs. To get Happy Hour prices, go between 3-7. If you can't make it, it's still worth it. Sushi is great, but be prepared to spend some mulah.

I'm pretty picky when it comes to Urgent Care clinics and this place is awesome! Great staff, clean office and quick service. Andy was joking around with me in a British accent, which definitely brightened my mood. If you're looking for a quick and easy Urgent Care with a outstanding customer service, go here!

I will admit - Cane's sauce is what keeps me coming back! But at this particular location, it's the staff as well. They always deliver outstanding customer service, which is awesome because there are so many places that hire these young kids who are just brats. Whoever is the hiring manager - keep up the good work! And give your staff a pat on the back.

This place is a great find! A bit off The main strip of Old Town Scottsdale, which makes for a great location, free parking round the back to boot. My boyfriend got the Pescado Barracho and he loved it, his only complaint was that they gave him a lot of fish, so he had some left over, which isn't a real complaint. I was a bit adventurous and got the PBJ Bacon Burger and it was awesome! Great service, great food - we'll definitely be coming back.

This place has amazing breakfast food! I have tried something different every time and have loved every bite of it all. Their Portuguese donuts dipped in their strawberry jam is out of this world. You definitely have to try this place out. It's pretty busy on Saturdays, but if you go early enough on Sunday you can beat the crowd. They had these ooey gooey butter bars and they were amazing, but I haven't seen them in a while, so that's my only complaint.

This is my favorite hot yoga studio in the Phoenix area. It's not Bikram yoga, which is why I love it! The instructors are amazing and extremely friendly. I always leave here feeling amazing. Drop in classes are only $10 and their packages are very reasonable too. It's a bit of a drive for me and every mile is worth it! It gets really busy after the holidays when people are getting their New Years Resolutions started, but it tappers off after February, so go early to find a spot during those first two months.

I've been to the locations out in Peoria and Chandler and this one has the best stuff by far! In Chandler they make you wait in this long line to try on your size shoe and has a horrible selection. Peoria has a good selection, but it's far. Customer service is always great at this location and I always leave with a new, cute outfit without having to break the bank!

This place is very good, not the best, but it has reasonable prices and good quality food. I had the lamb gyro, which was awesome on my first visit, but today I had the chicken kabob plate and while the rice was great, the chicken was just okay, mildly burnt. Definitely recommend trying this place and getting a side of Greek fries!

This place has awesome burgers and fries, throw some stand sauce on top and it's even better! The service is great too - I was helped by a very nice girl at the window who went above and beyond for customer service. I haven't tried anything else, but if their tacos are as good as their burgers, I know I'll like them.

Until recently, I hadn't ventured into a Whole Foods because I had heard it was very expensive. While the rumors are true, you can't beat the variety of organic selection you find at every location. This is one of the only places I can find paleo almond flour bread that takes amazing! Try their Curry Chicken salad - you won't be sorry. Although I do love this place, there is a reason people jokingly refer to it as "Whole Check".

This place is a little hole in the wall with pretty great food. I went for the first time and got a traditional gyro and my boyfriend got a chicken skewer pita, all of which was very good. I also got a Baklava that was delicious. Nothing was out of this world, which is why I can't give five stars, but I would definitely go back!

This place has the worst customer service I've ever experienced at a gym. I wanted to do a one-day pass, so I called ahead to get some information and the man who answered the phone, Dennis, was very unenthused with my questions and was flat out rude. I brushed it off and went in anyway. When I get there, a man, who I presume to be Dennis, is standing at the desk. I ask for a day-pass and proceed to get the worst customer service I've ever received. He was rude and when he told me I couldn't get in unless he took my picture, I had it. This place is terrible and I heard all the equipment is shit anyway. Never going back here.
