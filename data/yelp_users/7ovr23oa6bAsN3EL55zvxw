After a disappointing trip to Dillard's, I decided to go to Sears.  The store was clean, it was easy to find what I was looking for, and the customer service rocked.  A+ for Sears, except for when they push their credit card.

It would be more truthful to give this location 0 stars because I was not even able to buy tickets.  Apparently being 19 and related to the person is not enough for buying them a ticket to a rated R movie.  Very disappointed in their customer service and will never visit this Harkins again.

Their amazing prices are instantly countered by despairing customer service.  If I want low prices I will go to goodwill over this place.  Looks like Dillard's is on my list of do not shop.
