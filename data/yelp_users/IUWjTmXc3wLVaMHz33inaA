Husband and I decided to try this place out based on the great Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint!  We ordered takeout, and weren't too adventures.  I ordered the Beef Panang and husband ordered a peanut chicken dish.  Both were delicious, the chicken was moist and flavorful, and the Panang had just the right amount of spice.  One of my main complaints with the local Thai eateries is that they generally do not provide much spicy kick, but Wild Thaiger knows how to pack the punch.  Definitely do not order the spicy dishes if you can't take the heat.

My husband and I ate here after I purchased a Groupon. We both really enjoy Greek food, so we were excited to try this place out for lunch.  While the food was not bad, I definitely will not return.  I ordered the falafel pita.  I thought the falafel was very dry, and there really wasn't enough tahini to help out the situation.  The portions were huge, so if you like that sort of thing, then this place is for you.  However, I am not a big eater, and leftovers tend to go bad in my fridge, so I was not particularly impressed with the portions.    My husband ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich.  Basically they took a chicken breast and threw marinara sauce and a little cheese on it and served it up.  The chicken did not have too much flavor, did not seem like it had been marinated or cooked in any interesting way.  Really, it was just a ton of mediocre food for not too much money.  This place wasn't bad, but it also wasn't good.  Come here if you like enormous portions of alright food for not too much money.

This place is really good!  If you go, order the combination platter, it's the best way to try several el salvadorian specialities.  Also, don't forget to order the baked bananas - delicious!  The horchata should not be missed either, it is different than mexican horchata, it has cinnamon and other goodies.  Try it.  Very reasonably priced, you will leave very full and very satisfied.

This place keeps it simple.  Only a few things on the menu, but it's all delicious!  Right next to lux, so you can get an iced chai with your tomato/mozzarella sandwich.  Yum!!!

I have been shopping around for a new stylist since my last stylist moved away nearly two years ago.  I live in Central Phoenix, and had been bouncing between my mother's stylist in Chandler, who I like, but is far away, and Salon Estique, which I liked, but never really LOVED.  Folks, I am in LOVE!  Miranda was seriously a miracle worker.  I showed her a picture of a style I liked, and she was able to modify the style to fit my hair texture and lifestyle.  I also had highlights that had turned brassy, and she brought them to life.  Further, I have thick hair, and it normally takes three hours to give me a highlight/cut/style.  Miranda finished in about two hours!    The best part was that I ended spending less than what I had been spending at Salon Estique.  $135 for a highlight, cut, toner, and style.  While I realize this is pricey, it's about $50 less than what I had been spending, and totally worth it for a cut that I just adore.  I have found a home :)

I came across this studio when searching for a place that offered prenatal yoga.  I have been so pleased!  The instructors are very friendly and knowledgeable, and the students are also very friendly and passionate.  The massages are also excellent.  I highly recommend this studio.

This is definitely one of my favorite brunch spots.  My husband and I just met some friends here for brunch, and as always, we ate delicious food.  I had the commuter sandwich with bacon, gruyere and avocado - DELISH!  My husband had an english muffin.  The coffee bar here is also very tasty, and their iced teas are delicious.  The only downside is that it is always very crowded, and parking is always difficult.  They have valet, but I tend to resent being forced into valet.    Don't forget to try the delicious Tammie Coe baked goods while you are here!

Husband and I tried to eat lunch here yesterday.  Our original plans were to try Arrogant Butcher, but I was in a bit of a hurry, and thought Sing High would be faster.  Wrong!  We arrived just before the noon rush.  We were seated quickly and the waitress took our order almost immediately.  Husband ordered the lemon chicken and I ordered the mu shu pork.  Then, thirty minutes passed.  No waitress coming by to tell us the food would take a while, or refill our drinks, or ask if we wanted anything else.  Nothing.  So..... We Left.  The one star really is for the service, we actually didn't taste the food.  Not a good place to come if you need a quick lunch.  Why have a restaurant downtown if you aren't going to be able to cater to quick lunches on the go?

I go here for lunch all of the time!  I LOVE the lemongrass tofu, the thai iced tea is delicious and I have heard that the shrimp is amazing.  I don't know, because I have never tried anything except for the tofu, it is delicious, i just can't break away.   What really makes this place great for lunch is that it is cheap and quick. This place gets two thumbs up from me!

My husband and I came here for a little staycation and to get a good night of sleep and relaxation, away from our baby.   Sanctuary did not disappoint.  The mountainview casita was gorgeous, complete with complimentary bottles of water, bath salts, a window from the bathtub that looks into the room; thus, providing a beautiful mountain view.  The mountain view was incredible.    We also enjoyed the infinite edge pool, hot tub, and spa.  The only reason I put four stars instead of five is due to the room service.  We ordered brunch, and the food just was not very good.  I had a huevos rancheros omelet, which was heavy on the eggs, and light on pretty much everything else.  The side of potatoes was a bit blah, and it was pretty disappointing.  At the Spa, we took the Massage 101 class which was really informative and relaxing.  The spa amenities were top-notch, with a wonderful steam room, and attendants that were constantly roving to ensure everything was as it should be.  Overall we had a very nice stay at this resort, and I would highly recommend this place.

Husband and I have been here a number of times and always enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.  The best part about this place is the atmosphere.  I always feel like I am in an episode of Mad Men and that I need to order a gimlet and smoke a cigarette (nevermind the fact that I don't know what a Gimlet is, and I don't smoke).  Last night, we met some friends here for drinks before heading over to watch a show at the Phoenix Theater.  It was a great meeting place.  We all had martinis (delicious) and then walked over to the theater.  This is not only an excellent dinner place, but also wonderful for your pre or after show drinks!

(Un)fortunately for me, lux is close to my house.  I walk there nearly every day and am much poorer because of it.  The coffee and pastries are amazing.  They always play really great music too!

I really enjoy this place.  It is in a romantic little house.  It has a great wine list and the pizza is really good.  I think the pizza compares to Bianco's pizza, but you don't have to wait several hours to eat.  Big plus in my book!

This is my new favorite coffee shop!  Their iced chai is the best I have ever had.  They also have a really great assortment of baked goods made right there.  The cupcakes are divine.  I have also had the bagels, which are also delicious.  I am ready to go back and have a rice crispy treat!

This is one of my favorite places to go for some post-work drinks.  The sangria is delicious - not to sweet, which is a really common with Sangria around these parts.  The portions are small, but it's a tapas place, so what do you expect?  The prices are reasonable given the quality of food.  Try the tortilla or the garbanzos, they are both really delicious!

I debated between three and four stars because although I did not really like my meal, everyone else I was with seemed to enjoy theirs.  St Francis has a really neat atmosphere, with convertible, indoor/outdoor seating.  The service was good, but the food just didn't really impress me.  I wasn't super hungry, so I ordered the flatbread with fig and goat cheese, and it just didn't impress.  Nevertheless, everyone else in my party had the burger and fries and really enjoyed their meals, particularly the fries.  Maybe if I had come with a larger appetite I would have enjoyed the meal.  Overall, I would give a five for atmosphere and three for food, but I may be changing my review.

I came here for lunch with my mother and sister.  It was the middle of the afternoon, so we did not take advantage of the BYOB.  Sadly.  However, the sushi was delicious!  We tried the volcano roll, the caterpillar roll, and various sashimi and nigiri.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  I can't wait to go back for dinner with a nice bottle of something special :)

The last four miles of this marathon (the whole) were excruciatingly boring.  They changed the course for 2009 and it was for the worse.  It is a really terrible way to end what is otherwise a pretty scenic run.

My husband and I went to Bourbon Steak for Restaurant and had a very lovely time.    For starters, the service was spectacular.  The waiters came by regularly refilling water glasses and drink orders.  The bartender was extremely friendly and knowledgeable, he made excellent recommendations and mixed a mean Manhattan.  The restaurant was a bit loud and dark, but we were in good company and unaffected by our surroundings.  The meal started with complimentary Duck Fat french fries served three ways.  These were delicious and a great start to a wonderful meal.  There was also some sponge bread which was alright, but not spectacular.    I ordered the Lobster and Corn Bisque, Kobe Flat Iron Steak and 18 Year Butterscotch Pot de Creme with beignets.  The soup was tasty, the sweetness of the corn and lobster paired well with the spicy apples.  There was also a corn bread fritter which added nice texture to the soup.  I thought the Kobe flat iron was delicious and prepared very well.  It was paired with bone marrow mashed potatoes and onions prepared three ways.  The dish was delicious and well rounded.  The desert was fabulous.  The butterscotch pot de creme had just the right amount of bitterseet UMPH.  The beignets added a nice sweet balance to the creme.  All in all we had a fantastic experience.  I don't know that I would come here and pay full price, but I was extremely satisfied with my $39 meal.

I absolutely adore shopping at Hissyfits.  I like to dress my baby boy like a baby, and they have beautiful, stylish baby clothing for basement prices.  I greatly appreciate this high-quality consignment store, I always find great deals here and it's impossible for me to leave without buying SOMETHING for my son.  Hissyfits has a large selection of clothing from infant to tween sizes.  Unlike most places, it has a large selection of attractive boys clothing.  It also sells baby gear such as swings, strollers, bouncers, jumper etc.  Maternity clothing, children's toys, books, and furniture can also be found.  This is my go-to place when shopping for my son.

This is my office favorite for lunch.    Lunch here is always speedy, but also very good.  During peak lunch times, my office mates and I can always come here and find a seat.  Within minutes of being seated, we are served a starter salad with a delicious sesame dressing.   I have tried several of the dishes and been pleased with all.  Some of my favorites include the eggplant, spicy vegetable, and the green and red curries.  My only complaint is that the "spicy" isn't super spicy.  That being said, spicy carry some heat, and it's enough to please me and keep me coming back.    Oh, and did I mention the price?  Lunch with tax and tip usually runs me about eleven dollars.  Not bad for a hot lunch, salad and egg roll with quick service!

NOCA is the epitome of a strip mall gem.    From the outside, it looks like a bonafide hole in the wall. Nothing flashy, just another storefront next to the Safeway.  However, once you walk inside, you are immediately whisked away to a world of culinary delightfulness.  My husband and I ate here a few weeks ago when his parents were in town to provide free babysitting for the little one.  Eager to venture out on our own, we decided to try NOCA.   While there, we chose the tasting menu.  We began with a mis which consisted of a balsamic cured strawberry with a marcona almond. Yum.  Hubby started off with the Reuben and I had the avocado soup.  Both were delicious.  The pasta course was tasty.  For the main course, hubby had the veal and I had the sturgeon.  Both were perfectly cooked and perfectly paired.  Desert included complimentary cotton candy along with a peanut butter smores dish which may have been the crown jewel of the evening, and a peach shortbread which was also very delicious.  It is not often that I eat out and feel that desserts are on par with the general menu, but NOCA was an adventure from the mis all the way to the after-dinner cordials!

Eh...    Maybe this place is just too sophisticated for my palate.  Hubby and I came here for lunch last Monday.  I ordered the Shabu style Hot and Sour soup with tofu, and hubby ordered the sugar cane pork spare ribs and chili lime beef.  The soup was alright, but not very substantial.  It came with a variety of vegetables, some japanese vegetable I cannot even begin to spell, mushrooms, baby corn, and tomatoes.  I must admit, the hot house tomatoes sort of threw me off.  Because it said Shabu style, i had envisioned something more, more noodles and tofu for dipping perhaps?  Anyway, I definitely would not order that dish again.  The chili lime beef was actually a beef carpaccio, more lime than chili.  Not that I have anything against carpaccio, but there was nothing on the menu to indicate it would be carpaccio style, and I feel like that is something you should disclose.    The sugar cane pork definitely stole the show.  They were tangy and sweet, and extremely tasty.  However one winner out of three just isn't enough to make me want to come back.

This is my new favorite place to eat in Phoenix.  I have been here a few times, and it has never failed to impress.  Their ginger ale is homemade and absolutely divine.  The chicken and waffles are incredible.  The chorizo stuffed dates? Excellent!  I can go on and on.  The tuck shop is a slow food restaurant, so don't expect to come here for a quick bite.  However, if you are looking for a unique and creative meal in a down-home atmosphere, you should definitely give this place a try.

I would highly recommend Camelback Pediatrics.  This place was recommended to me by a friend that works in the neonatal unit at St. Josephs, and a different friend that works at Phoenix Children's Hospital.  WHAT AN EXCELLENT PLACE!  I have seen a few of the doctors, and they have all been very friendly and personable.  They calmly answer all of my questions, and explain things very clearly.  My son is an infant, and everyone that handles him at this office always manages to get a huge smile out of him.  The office is divided for sick and healthy patients, and there is also an infant room, to keep the babies away from the germs.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a pediatrician.

I just took my 4 month old son to My Gym for a baby class, and we had so much fun!  The class started out with all of the babies on blankets with balls.  There were five babies and two instructors in the class.  We did some baby warm-ups, which consisted of the parents moving the babies' arms and legs around in various ways. Then we did songs with the babies, tummy time with toys, danced with the babies, put them in swings, on a baby zipline and then played with puppets!  It was a jam-packed 45 minutes, and my son really loved it.  I would recommend this place to anyone.

My husband and I came here for Restaurant Week and were very pleasantly surprised.    From the special menu, I ordered the canellini bean soup with fried goat cheese.  It was both salty and smooth.  You could really taste the softness of the beans, and the salty goat cheese really finished out the cheese.  My husband ordered the caprese with candied prosciutto.  The mozzarella was very fresh, and the prosciutto was delicious.    For the entree, I had the Sea Bass, which was perfectly cooked.  The chef left the skin on, and it gave the fish a crispy outer texture which was both unusual and tasty.  My husband ordered the duck egg papardelle with braised short ribs.  His dish was delectable, and I definitely had entree envy.  We finished things off with a Mojito Panna Cotta which was minty and limey and tasty.    We were somewhat nervous trying a new restaurant for restaurant week when there were such great, established deals, but Cielo did not disappoint!  We had great food, and would definitely return :)

It is so rare to find a place where you can sit down, eat a delicious meal, and leave,  feeling both healthy and happy.  Seasons 52 fits this bill.  Every single item on their menu has under 475 calories!  I actually had to ask the server to ensure that any plate I ordered would have less than 500 calories on it (as opposed to ordering a plate that is actually two servings and has 1,000 calories... restaurants are sneaky!).  I came here for lunch with a friend of mine and ordered the Green Chile Relleno and found it extremely tasty.  The Chile was fresh and not too spicy, the chicken (in the relleno) was well-marinated, and the chile had just the right amount of cheese, enough for good flavor, but not enough to make you sick.  My friend ordered the blackened fish tacos which also looked delicious.    A nice thing about eating here for lunch is that they ask you if you are in a hurry.  So many places don't care that you are taking time out of your work day to visit their establishment.  The server was fast and the food came out quickly. This is a great place for a power lunch, and I will be bringing my husband here for dinner.

Came here again for a Saturday lunch with husband and the baby.  The staff did a great job getting us a table away from the hustle and bustle where baby could eat his Cheerios in peace, and I didn't have to worry about the waitstaff spilling anything on him.    The food, again, did not disappoint.  We started with the tomato, rosemary, and parmesan flatbread which was light, crispy and tasty.  Husband and I both ordered the Vinho Verde from the chef's picks.  The wine was light, crispy and just a tad sparkling.  It was the perfect complement to a warm, sunny, Saturday afternoon.  I ordered the blackened fish tacos and husband ordered the chicken shwarma kebobs.  The fish tacos were fresh and spicy.  I really liked them, but felt they kind of went overboard on the lettuce (which I just picked out, and then enjoyed them just fine). My husband really enjoyed the kebobs, which came with a spicy mango chutney and side salad.  The mango chutney was a nice compliment to the chicken.  The side salad came with pumpkin seeds which added a nice texture to the salad.  We ordered the chocolate and peanut butter mini indulgence which was tasty and just the right size.  We left feeling satisfied, but not overstuffed - I LOVE that!  This place will definitely be added to my regular rotation of restaurants.

Alex did an amazing job with my hair.  I had always just done the same blah thing and Alex made my hair really hip and stylish.  I won't go to anyone else now.  I started going to mood swings when I lived near Mill Ave.  I now live about thirty minutes away, but still make the trek over there.  It's worth it for great hair!
