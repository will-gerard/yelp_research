Very disappointed with this location! The one on 59th Ave tops this one by far! I ordered 2 California bowls for take out. Paid and then they mention that they were out citrus rice and they used the Mexican rice instead. Guess it's okay since I already paid. Anyways I didn't think it was a big deal, it was okay but there were plenty of uncooked or not cooked all the way rice grains. Made for a crunchy meal. All in all I didn't end up eating even half because I was grossed out. Never been so disappointed in this fresh mex restaurant then the location on bell! Again go to the 59th Ave one, the staff is fun and excellent!! The food is consistent and delicious!!!

Okay so screw all the negative 1 star, 2 star reviews!! I've eaten at tons of sushi places! Sushi catcher is by far the best sushi I've had in Phoenix!!! I love how it's a little hole in the wall place! The staff is excellent! Always remember My family and I!! Their pricing is by far the cheapest in Phoenix!!! Large beer and saki for 5 bucks you can't beat that all day every day!!! I recommend anyone looking for a good sushi spot that this is the place to go!!!

I've been getting my hair done by Allyson for almost a year now! I wouldn't recommend anyone else! I'm a very picky person when it comes to my blonde hair, I've never had anyone nail it on the first try! But Allyson gets it every time, I always leave extremely happy! If your looking for a stylist who understands your wants and needs really listens to you! She's the one! Pick Ally for your next hair adventure you won't regret it!!!
