One star reviews are really rare for me, So much so, that, if I am giving a one star review, I will usually just not even bother to write the review.   Coach and Willie's probably deserves better, but for what we paid and the quality of food we got, I have to do what I have to do.  Here goes...  We had been given tickets to the Diamondbacks game and, not too familiar with the area, this was the first place we found. The game was starting in a little over an hour when we showed up. Even at that, we did not get bad service, the one star is primarily directed at the food, which was not good.  I get very dismayed when something on the menu sounds really good and is such a disappointment. I ordered the Baja Fish Wrap. I love fish tacos and this sounded like something in the same vein. They do give you a choice of sides. I chose the wedge salad. The fish was bland. The lavosh wrap around it was soggy and falling apart. The menu promised spicy sauce... again bland. The wedge salad was a travesty. It was just an unwieldy wedge of lettuce with a small amount of dressing on it. It took up over half the plate. When you tried to cut it it made everything slide off the other side. I gave up on it after the first few bites. It wasn't worth the work and mess. My wife had a nearly identical experience with her tequlila-lime chicken wrap... no flavor at all in any of the food.  These sandwiches and two drinks cost us over $50. Hence, one star. We won't be going back here.

Traveling through Phoenix, we were just looking for a light, quick bite to eat. We pulled up to one of the twin ordering stations. I thought this was a neat concept until I witnessed the not-well-thought-out merging process. The line from the second station was a straight shot to the pick-up window and the line from the first station had to merge into that line. It was a microcosm of Phoenix freeways at a McDonalds, complete with traffic jams and crazy drivers.  The food: My McBurger was dry and tasteless; my wife's chicken McNuggets were petrified and they forgot the ranch dipping sauce, which made her realize that the sauce is the only thing that saves them.   This location is convenient to the freeway, but next time we are passing through I think we'll just keep going.

If you are looking for a place to have your wedding or event, look here first.  The grounds are beautiful. The staff is extremely accommodating. We're talking you bring your own food and they will set up and serve it for you. Very unheard of in this day and age.  Guests leave happy and, let's face it, isn't that what weddings or special events are about?

I'm from Tucson and recently discovered Pita Jungle after they opened a location there. I was visiting family in Tempe and was happy to discover there was a Pita Jungle close by.  I cannot visit PJ without ordering the Cilantro-Jalape√±o Hummus, either as an appetizer or, sometimes, as a meal. It never disappoints.  Their Kafta burger has always intrigued me, but PJ's food is supposed to be healthy, right? And burgers are not healthy, right? Yes, it's a burger, but it still felt semi-healthy as there was basically a salad inside the burger, which was dressed in a tasty, lemony vinaigrette. Alongside the burger were some of those heady garlic new potatoes.  My mom ordered the Gyro and I watched in amazement as my five foot nothing, whisper of a mom ate the whole humongous thing.  I am a big fan of Pita Jungle. It's an Arizona treasure.

I have never been to this stadium for it's intended purpose - Cardinal football. I did, however, attend a high school graduation here.  It's an awesome stadium that I am positive will make for an awesome game day experience.   I can't wait to  go back for a football game. I am going to go look for tickets now. Surely a five star review update awaits.

Comfort,  convenience and affordability... that's what you'll get from this hotel.   Pluses:  Free shuttle to places in a reasonable radius; like the Cardinals stadium, Jobing.com arena or AK - Chin Pavilion - which was where the concert we were in town for was happening.  Free hot breakfast... came in handy the morning after the concert  There are also plenty of decent places to eat fairly nearby... just in case FREE does not mean the same to you as it does to me.  Friendly staff - both of the desk clerks I dealt with were extremely nice and seemed genuinely concerned about taking care of guests.  The only minus I can point out is the shower curtain. It was oddly short, barely reached the top of the tub and hardly contained the shower stream. They are obviously not as concerned with keeping the housekeeping staff as happy as the guests.  As long as you don't expect spa treatments or bellhops this hotel will fit your needs well if you need it for a concert or a Cardinals gane.

My wife had traveled to Phoenix for work and her coworkers took her here for lunch. She said we would have to try it if we were ever in Phoenix.   So, on our way home, we found ourselves about five minutes from this location... perfect chance to try it.  She knows what I like, bless her heart, and I was not disappointed in Babbo.  They start you off with soft focaccia bread, which, when it's 2:30 in the afternoon and this is your first meal, does not last long. Olive oil and balsamic vinegar are poured on a plate for your dipping pleasure. Very good.  Daughter #1and I had the pizza and salad special. We both got the Pepperoni, Sausage and Mushroom pizza. I got the Mista salad and she got the house salad. The only thing on the salad she did not like, was the golden raisins. She picked them out and put them on my plate... I was happy to oblige. You could see them in the kitchen tossing pizza dough, so we got nice, fresh pizza. My daughter announced, "this is the best pizza I have ever had". I won't go that far, but it was really good.  Daughter #2 - Fettuccine Alfredo (I think she must have cream and parmesan cheese coursing through her veins by now). was enjoyed thoroughly.  Wife - Pasta Martini (their version of Penne Vodka) was her choice. She enjoyed it, but the addition of Kalamata olives was slightly odd. She said it was overkill and seemed like they did not belong.  I liked the ambience and the price was fairly reasonable. Babbo seems to be a Phoenix chain. It would be nice if they would expand into an area near us. I think I would be a regular.

Traveling through Phoenix looking for someplace to stop and eat, we stumbled upon Smashburger.  You order at the counter, seat yourself and the food is delivered to your table. They sell beer and fountain soda to help you wash down your burger and accoutrements.  My wife and I both got the Classic, a burger with "Smash sauce" (described by the counter clerk as a mixture of mayo, mustard and pickle relish), lettuce, onion, pickle, and tomato. The burgers were:  1. Obviously fresh, not frozen, meat - this was apparent by the odd shape of the meat. 2. Juicy and not overcooked. 3. Seasoned well  We were both happy with our burgers.  The garlic and rosemary fries were good, when hot. When they cooled down, the flavor became almost cloying. Maybe it's just because I am not too big a fan of rosemary. Nonetheless, an interesting take on fast food fries.  I was not too unhappy with the price tag. Two burgers and fries for $14. Seems pretty standard to me. The atmosphere of the place is kind of sterile. It's not a place to grab a burger, have a few beers and hang out. As I said, we were traveling through, so it met our needs well for this visit and I would likely return.

Not in my neck of the woods, I relied on  a family member to help me find a place for lunch. Thanks cuz....  Good thing he knows what I like. This place was right up my alley.   I arrived first and was waiting for the rest of the group to arrive. While I was waiting and listening to the rather loud grunge music being played, I figured I would order an appetizer. I opted for the hellfire chips, which confounds me why they did not call them buffalo chips. Allow me to explain:  take your standard buffalo chicken wings, complete with bleu cheese dressing and substitute thick, housemade potato chips for the chicken wings. Sprinkle some green onions and MORE bleu cheese crumbles on top and you have buffalo chips. I don't heap this kind of praise often - it's the best appetizer I have had in a restaurant in a long time.  Oh yeah, I ordered a HopKnot (OK I had two), from your friendly local brewery, which during happy hour, will only make three bucks fly from your wallet.  The rest of the group arrives (the grunge music fades into the background once you have someone to talk to) and a selection of sandwiches, burgers, salads and sides were ordered. The food was good, but those buffalo chips had already stolen the show and that was hard to live up to.  I only regret that I don't live closer because their happy hour looks really good and I am a sucker for a really good happy hour. I may just have to make a trip up I-10 to visit during happy hour. Hey cuz... got room for me to crash at your place?

It pays to know a local. We came here at the suggestion of my cousin, who lives in the area. We arranged to meet here after a text exchnage.  The beer was fine. I had the flight, which allowed me to taste several of them. My favorite was the Hop Dog, a double IPA. Other reviews mention that the beer is not as cold as it could or should be. Good point Yelpers....  The food was fine as well. Our group of four, had Mango-Hot wings, poppers and garlic-parm fries as appetizers. I thought the wings were not very meaty and the sauce just tasted OK. The poppers were fine. The garlic-parm fries had enough garlic to make you vampire-proof. My wife had the basic burger but changed her side to the side salad. Later, she was talking about wanting to go back for that salad, so I guess it was good. I had the Herd's burger, which from their menu and website, looks like it has it's roots in some Texas burger joint. I asked for medium, but the burger is subjected to some special meat-chopping-griddle-cooking process they said it can only be prepared well done. OK.. fine. The burger was decent. There was something spicy. Not sure if it was the mustard or the pepper-jack cheese I asked for. I upgraded to onion rings. That cost another $1.50.  We had a really good server named Aaron who took excellent care of us and even shook our hands when we left. The dog themed ambiance is kinda cool and the food and beer are fine. I know that's not exactly a glowing endorsement, but service like that gets them an extra star and a half.
