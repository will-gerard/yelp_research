I don't know what I'm doing here right now. I feel like this place should have died with the 80s, it's creepy alright. Had the pastrami hash $10 for an infant sized portion. I don't know how this place is even around. It's a sad weird place frozen in time. Avoid at all costs. I've done the work for you now eat elsewhere.

The food here was cheap and awful. The restaurant itself is poorly kept and uncomfortable. I will never eat here again. I would suggest only getting tortillas here if anything. Avoid the burritos and enchiladas honestly just a salty goopy consistency mediocre at best. I would not recommend this food to anyone.

We came here on a whim and left beyond satisfied. The staff is super friendly and the food is on point. The macaroons are a MUST! My crystal ball confirms that we will be coming again soon.
