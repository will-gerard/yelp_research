The pastor tacos are amazing. Closest pastor tacos I can find similar to tacos in Mexico. The edamame with garlic soy glaze can be a bit salty but delicious, service was ok. I'll be back

I love this place! It's my daily study breakfast  burrito spot! They open up early so it's perfect for so last minute studying and grubbing before my early summer class!

I was very disappointed in this dog park. Sure it has a pond for the dogs to go in and swim which is a plus but the whole area is gravel and hardly any shade. People raved about this location so I drove 35 min to check it out and the big dog area was not accessible due to construction, the water looked nasty and there was dog throw up in multiple spots! I won't be returning to this dog park.

After watching the movie Chef I had to try a sandwich Cubano! It was soo good I did my without pickles and the mustard on the side, mustard is necessary to tie in all the flavors together! And the yucca Fritas I think they got were on point! Don't think I'll go back but it was a good experience

Very excited I came to this place. I gotta admit I went around 2 in the afternoon and there were Almost no cars in the parking lot and the building is pretty skeptical from the outside, but I thought hey why not!  Pho with chicken and added veggies, my bowl came out super fast and overflowing with goodies inside! I was so busy enjoying the broth, veggies and meat I almost forgot about the noodles!  Can't wait to come again!!    **I come here every week, now**
