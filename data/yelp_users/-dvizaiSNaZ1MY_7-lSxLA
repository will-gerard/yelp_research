I believe most auto shops try to rip off females, this would be yet another one of those shops you shouldn't go to without your boyfriend or husband. I brought my 2009 Toyota Camry in for new rear brakes & the quote was outragous! I was told I needed new Rotors also (which isn't a big deal). The quote just for the rear was $380! Then I was told my axle needed to be replaced, & was quoted $393! They gave me completely inaccurate information on how much pad life I had left on my fronts also.   I went next door to Sundevil Auto and they fixed my brakes and rotors for $260! Thank goodness I shopped around, & in the same shopping center ha!

He called me and apologized for the wrong quote that I was given and re-quoted my axle at an amazing price. I took him up on the offer & I got my car fixed there today... He even threw in a oil change! I will be coming back to see Kenny and the rest of the Brake Masters team. They really care about their customers!! Thank you again for the excellent customer service... My car drives beautiful!

Nasty bar with AWFUL service!!!! I've never been so disrespected by a bartender before!! Not only was I harassed 2 seconds after walking in the bar by a bartender with purple hair, but she also stared at myself & my girlfriends the entire time. $10 minimum if you are going to be using a card. I ordered a beer and asked to close my card, the bartender said $10 minimum, I can just close you out & ring up $10. Uhhhh I'm sorry but I'm not going to drink 1 $10 Coors light so keep my card open. Next time I tried to get a drink I was ignored & both bartenders helped everyone around me!   The managers/owners need to be aware that their trashy bartender & staff are chasing money & female customers right out the door!!! She is the reason I will NEVER come back to this bar, wow how embarrassing to have an employee like that!!! I wish I could give this bar zero stars.

I love the atmosphere at House of Tricks. If you didn't already know where the location was, you would not be able to find it just driving down the street! The big trees make for a hidden, romantic patio, and almost makes you feel like you are not in Arizona anymore!! I ordered a White Spanish wine, it was very good. Although it did not go with the Filet I ordered! I believe I ordered it Medium Rare and it was more along the lines of Rare, but I refused to bring it back! It melted in my mouth! The fish was perfect though! I love how the menu is always different!!! I recommend House of Tricks for a Romantic Dinner, anniversary Dinner, or birthday!

If your planning on going to this location...DON'T!!! Everything I order was disgusting. Chicken strips hard and cold, forgot to put sauces I asked for in the bag, and burger looked like a 5 year old created it. The only thing good at this or any sonic is there drinks, which they do manage to screw those up also. Beware of sonic, there going down the drain!

AMAZING food, drinks, and service!!!! It is nice to splurge once in a while, and I recommend this place for Romantic dinners, or maybe even a business dinner!!! The Lobster and steak is to die for. Extremely classy place. Very expensive, but was worth it! The Champagne was flowing, and we were front row to the GREAT live band!!! This is a MUST TRY place in Scottsdale!!!!

I'm a foodie, and this place never disappoints!!! I love the amazing sandwiches, so fresh... and great quality boars head meat! Everything is homemade, made to order, and made right infront of you. I always get the Gabster, no cream cheese, and add turkey on 9-grain... to die for! I still need to try the Breakfast Burritos. They have awesome Iced Tea also. Not to mention, they also deliver!!!

The Vine is maybe a 2 minute car ride from our home! My boyfriend and I enjoy drinking a Stein & sharing some wings. The chive fries are great. However, recently the quality of the traditional bone-in wings have been awful!!! They are so tiny, & barely any meat on them. So, we decided to try the boneless. Not that great. I rather drive to Buffalo Wild Wings & enjoy some REAL wings!!! But the service is always good!

THE BEST Italian Food in Tempe. Rigatony's reminds me of New York Italian Food! I go here for every birthday, and event. I always order Chicken Marsala, all you can eat antipasto salad, and wine!! This restaurant has not let me down, and the service is always great! Especially for always going with such big groups of people! I am going there for my birthday this weekend, with 15 friends! Can't wait! Highly Recommend!!

I like the General Tso Chicken & egg drop wonton soup. Really good lunch specials & great prices. It's nice and clean inside also.

Laura is amazing! She made me feel so comfortable and she's so professional. She is so friendly and really cares about her clients. She makes sure the color is a perfect fit for you, & makes sure you're happy with the color once she's done spraying. The bronze bar is super cute & clean. I don't stink of spray tan like I have in the past from other places I've gone. The tan is also organic & is a beautiful golden bronze! The bronze bar is also really affordable & does student discounts. I will definitely be coming back! Thanks Laura!

Great Taco Tuesday specials. 3 tacos for $6. The pork tacos are AMAZING & so are the Carne Asada tacos! The nachos are also a MUST TRY, they are huuuuge! I work right across the street so the fast service is perfect for a quick lunch break!

Over priced and nothing special! I went in for a pedi and the chair I had was broken so the massage didn't work and I had uncomfortable knobs poking into my back the entire time. I told them and they didn't do anything. The color polish I pick was almost out & I didn't even realize... but it's an OPI "Susie's hungry again" and they had many up there that the guy could of traded it out with. But he didn't. My polish went on uneven with different layers. The next day I wore my Nikes to the gym and my big toe already is chipped. Find another nail salon!!!!

Mmmm the best! Tigers Blood with cream! Staff is always friendly and helpful. The punch cards are the best! Try ice cream on the bottom next time! Can't go wrong. The drive thru is also nice.

El Hefe is a great addition to the already wild Mill Ave atmosphere!! I really enjoy the Margaritas and people watching on the front patio! The service is good, and the girls look good too! My friends and I go here a lot on the weekends, and sometimes to day drink!   It gets extremely busy on the weekends so you better WATCH OUT when paying with a card!! My boyfriend was double charged $79.00 when he told the server to split the tab with our friends (even though they both signed their receipts)! Beware and check those bank statements!!

I love this place!!!! It's great when you are on the go & don't have time to make lunch or dinner & still trying to maintain a healthy diet. I love how they have a drive thru. I had a BBQ chicken ranch wrap. It was huge!! Also so fresh. The service was great. I had my dog in the backseat & the guy at the window gave him a treat. Healthy & pet friendly? WOO HOO! I can't wait to go back & try more menu items. This place is fabulous!!! Just what this area needed! Thanks Salad to Go!
