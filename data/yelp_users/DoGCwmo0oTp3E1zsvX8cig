Excellent service all around and for a great price! They are friendly and have wonderful attitudes. I've come here every time, and haven't had a poor experience.

Simply horrible experience. I asked for an oil change only. I asked for the cheapest oil as that is what I have been going with. It is my car my choice. The man comes out and tells me that I need to go with the highest priced synthetic oil for my car. Otherwise I am abusing my car and not properly taking care of it. Even though I had already asked specifically for the lowest, (mind you their oil prices are $10 over most.) Then when he finally agrees I get in my car and it smells horrible and there was grease all over my seat and steering wheel. I couldn't believe the service I received. Completely unacceptable. I don't enjoy being talked down to and then treated poorly.

I absolutely love KFC but definitely not this one. I asked for Mac n Cheese and I ended up having mashed potatoes. My food was cold as if it's been sitting for 30-45 mins. I don't think I'll be going back.
