Cons: 1. We were seated 10 minutes before happy-hour ended, but were not greeted by a waitress until it was too late to order. 2. I had to ask 3 times for another drink before either waitress would bring me one, and then was overcharged on my bill for an incorrect number of beers. Just because I asked 6 times for a beer, I only actually ordered 3. This does not give you permission to charge me for 6 beers. 3. None of the food came out at the same time. There was a 10-minute gap between when the first plate came out and when the last plate came out. 4. The quality of the food was poor to say the least. $7 for a salad that was no bigger than the bowl of cereal I ate this morning is unacceptable. Also, the creations found in the selection for the bruschetta board reminded me of when my 4 year-old nephew made his own lunch one day; "Nacho cheese with sliced dates covered in crushed-up Dorito chips"  Pros: 1. None of my party has contracted Dysentery. 2. They serve alcohol 3. I was able to beg and plead and get at least 3 drinks from the watiress. 4. I was able to spend time on the patio with my family.  Overall: Next time we will know better...
