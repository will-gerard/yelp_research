The front desk receptionist was kind as was the nurse who weighed my son and took his temp, but the wait so far has been absurd. Going on over 90 minutes........with a 10 mth old with a presumed ear infection....and it wasnt even too busy when we first arrived...Oh, and they also have no changing table....at a pediatric urgent care

The bartender was a douchebag. I came with a large group for a London bus crawl tour so it WAS busy but this jerk looked directly at me twice and served the people on each side of me and never took my order. I moved to the other side of the bar and the same thing happened.  This was over the course of 30 MINUTES. THEN he had the nerve to tell me to get out when i called him out on his very poor service.  When I came back to take his picture to post to Yelp (which is in my comment in the "Tips" section), he asked why I was taking his picture.  When I explained my intention of posting it on Yelp he again told me to get out.  Fortunately, this crapshoot of a place only had ONE bartender and ONE server on a SATURDAY night, so he couldn't do anything other than direct me to leave.

If you go to "tips" you see another of my reviews of this same place.  Troy D., who calls my review "stupid," also works at Turf as a bartender.  So as you can see, more than one of their staff at this place put the customer first...

This place is awesome! When the dr suggested i eliminate dairy from my diet for my son's sake my first thought was "no more pizza!" but they have vegan "cheese" (as well as gluten free crust) which is incredible! The drinks are great too!

Good music, great atmosphere, and our waiter was very sociable. They have a vegan option on the menu which is always nice. I ordered the chicken burrito and a mixed berry margarita which were both delish.
