This place is a trip. We went just after Thanksgiving so the Christmas lights were up. There must be thousands and thousands of lights. It's like Christmas lights on crack. Truly. The night we went it was packed. We actually had to wait to get in because they were at capacity, but we waited for a few minutes and some people left and we went in. This is a great spot for people watching. It's truly a dive. They are not mixing up craft cocktails here. It's a plastic cup kind of establishment. As long as you are not expecting anything remotely fancy (or clean) you will have a great time here because it's a fun place to grab a casual drink.

I was staying in Scottsdale for a week at Thanksgiving and took to yelp to try and find the best places for juice within walking distance of where I was staying. This was one of the spots and after my first visit, I knew that I didn't need to go anyplace else! I tried several of the cold pressed juices and the easy breezy smoothie. The juices are fresh and delicious. The juices come in 2 sizes and are pre-pressed and packaged. They seem to rotate what is on the menu, but all are fresh and delicious! And they'll let you have a sample before you make your decision. They also offer juice cleanses and delivery! I'll definitely be back the next time I am in town!

My father in law gets his haircut here and suggested that we take our son in for a big-kid cut. Rony squeezed us in last minute and took great care of the little guy...which was not easy because he is 3.5, squirmy, and has a lot of hair! Every part of the experience was fantastic! All of the barbers are super friendly and welcoming and they made my son feel right at home. They also didn't seem to mind the paparazzi-like photo session we had going on (hey the first barbershop haircut is a big deal). And at the end of the cut, they give everyone a little massage. It's like a spa day for dudes! Oh, and don't forget the secret candy stash! I was super impressed and can't say enough good things about this place. Too bad this place isn't on the east coast...but we will definitely be back the next time we are in town!

Creamy and delicious soft serve ice cream! I've only tried the vanilla but I hope to make another visit and try one of the mix ins because they sound amazing! The staff was friendly and attentive. We sat right in front of the window and they checked in with us a few times to see how we were enjoying our ice cream and if we needed anything else. It's a great spot not to be missed!

I'd like to start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of J.Crew. I've been loyal to this brand for over 20 years. I remember the days in high school (pre-Internet) of waiting for the catalog, picking everything out (with back up color choices), mailing in the order form and hoping and waiting for weeks (sometimes months) for my package to arrive. We are talking pre-Jenna Lyons, barn coat and cable knit sweater days. The days when J.Crew was known for back orders and delays and seemingly not having their s**t together. But I didn't care because I loved the clothes then as much as I love them now. That being said, when I walked in to this location I was less than impressed. Maybe it was an off day. Maybe the b-team was working. I don't know. All I know is that the woman who helped me acted like she couldn't be bothered and was more interested in helping someone else. I wanted to try on a pair of new balance sneakers and she was apparently annoyed by that because she tried to say that they might not have them before she even looked. When she came back with the shoes, she made it a point to say that they were not included in the sale because "they are a third party vendor." In case I was unaware of the difference between new balance and J.Crew? Ok. That's fine. I tried them on but they were too big so I wanted to get the next size down. She rudely ignored my attempts to get her attention and instead helped a woman who wanted to buy a vest that was 40% off. Zero acknowledgement. I waited for about 10 minutes. Two other sales people walked by me and offered no assistance. So I left the shoes on the couch and left the store. I'll probably buy them online because I do like them. But I'm not going to contribute to the sales of a store where the employees are completely indifferent and quite honestly, rude. In the age of the internet, customer service is huge. When I walk in to a real live store, I want them to deliver....otherwise, I can have it shipped to my door and not deal with the parking and the people. I don't think this store represents what J.Crew is aiming for. And it's kind of a small store (no crewcuts) for such a large mall.

Whenever we visit Arizona, it seems as though there is a new restaurant added to the Fox Restaurant family. This visit, we went to Flower Child several times. It's a healthy, fast food concept. You order and pay, they give you a number, and then bring your food to you. The menu has a lot of veggie, vegan, and gluten free options. And the place is seemingly never not crowded. Seriously.  I tried a bunch of the sides, all of which were tasty. I'm assuming that the sides vary by season, but the standouts for me were the brusseI sprouts and the indian spiced cauliflower. I also tried the thai cashew quinoa bowl which was a really large portion and had good flavor.  I can see why this restaurant is so popular-it's a good, healthy choice for eating out.
