Wow, I have become a huge fan of this place!  They have the best Chicken walnut salad and calamari.  The service is ALWAYS amazing!  My favorite healthy treat after a workout.

This is the best place I have ever been to stock up on protein and energy drinks.  Alex, the manager is always super helpful along with ALL the staff.  I have never had a bad customer service experience.  I went there at least once a week since they opened and now once a month now that I live in Chicago.  Great selection, highly knowledgable staff.

Okay, so last week I took my two cats to another vet for immunizations and to have one of them groomed (shaved).  Long story short, the experience was so traumatizing for one of my cats (yeah I know, Im a bad daddy) she urinated blood while she was being groomed.  The vet (at the OTHER clinic) told me that it was probably cancer and we would need a $500 xray asap.  Holy cow, talk about generating revenue from fear!  I decided to talk it over with my partner to determine what steps to take next, needless to say sleepless nights followed this visit.   Fast forward today, the same kitty now has a respiratory infection.  Well,  I was NOT going to the same vet, so I visited the YELP site for suggestions, which I should have done to begin with.  So I find Orangewood Animal hospital near me.  I call this morning to make an appointment.   I bought my sick kitty in and was met with wonderful front desk staff,  Get ushered into a room with  no wait.  Dr. Clark is in my room within minutes of my arrival.  Does an examination and reassures me it is NOT CANCER.  Said its simply bladders stones and puts her on a new diet in addition to treating her respiratory problem.  No drama, he was straight forward and honest. If I knew going to the vet was like going to a used car lot I would have been more prepared.  If you live in the area and need an honest vet, look no further than Orangewood Animal Hospital.

Eat here once a week.  I work at the airport and will always make a point to eat there when I can.  I use to enjoy the chicken delight, now I order the Carne asada.  I think its one of the best carne asada burritos I have ever had.   Yeah, it can be greasy, however, I always ask for my burrito with no oil or salt.   The service is always great.   The guacamole is good contrary to previous posts.  The "white" stuff in there is cottage cheese and it makes a great combination.    The alternative is Paradise bakery or Burger king, both with long lines.  Good choice to satisfy your hunger.

Very unorganized.  I had received multiple quotes and conflicting information regarding not only price, but time frame to have glass made and installed.   I will never use or refer anyone to this company.  Great customer service, poor execution.     A few weeks back I had to smash my window in my house because I locked my keys in my car.(this was a tuesday)  If it wasn't for the fact that I had to make a flight within an hour I would have called a locksmith.  Long story short, I made arrangements with several companies to come and do a estimate for window replacement.  They all informed me that there would be a 3-5 day wait for the window replacement.  I called True View Windows and they informed me that I would have same day service to include glass replacement.  WOW!  I canceled all the other companies that were scheduled come out.   The next day (wed) I had a technician come to my house to measure the window, he informed me that it would have to be custom made.  So, obviously same day service was NOT an option. He told me 3-5 days.  While he was there I had him measure my windows for screens, I thought I was going to have it done anyways, why not kill two birds with one stone.  Jeff, the technician was very professional and friendly.  He measure all my windows and gave me samples of screening to play with.  We were talking about the 80% and 90% screens.  He informed me there would be no difference in the price if I chose either.  So, he did the measurements same day.  Again he was very professional and friendly.   The next day (Thursday) I got a call from TRUE VIEW.  Got the time frame (3-5) business days for windows and an estimate for screens.  Screens were really highly priced 3 little block windows 12"12" (approx 1 sq ft each)  were going to be over $350.  In addition to that they told me there was a difference in the price for 80% to 90%.   I called on friday to get an idea of when my window was going to be ready.  When I called the woman told me 7-10 business days.  I had already left a deposit with the initial order.  I couldn't believe it.  I was hoping that window would be ready for installation for the following TUE- WED, I had cleared those two days.What happned to 3-5 business days? Well, those days weren't an option either.  Friday was the only day it could be done.  I told them I had a 5pm flight to catch on friday and if I could have an early morning appt.  They said it wasn't possible because the TECH has another apt that day.  Do they only have 1 technician?   My suggestion is get estimates and use another company.  As much as I appreciate great, friendly customer service, great service doesn't make up for my financial loss (rearranging schedule) or frustration

OVerall the food was good, however the service was crappy!  We waited forever to get someone to not only bring us water, but to take our order.  WHen I got up to look for someone  they were sitting at a table just relaxing.  Our food was literally tossed to us without any regard to whom it was going to.  My friend asked for two seperate items on the menu and was told "they were out".  for two items, one after the other?  I have had PHO at many places.  I WILL NOT be returning, my recommendation would be to go to MAXIM  up the street on 19th ave and Osborn.  This place was the pits!

Took my car in this afternoon, I have been having problems with pressure light coming on over the course of a year.  I figured I might need new tires or have to patch one up.  Either way, I was feeling a bit anxious wondering what the cost was going to be.  I brought my car in and I was surprised not only by quick service but everyone was friendly.  One of the technicians did a walk around with me, checked my pressure and told me they would check to find the source of the leak.  In true auto body nature, I expected them to find something, anything just to sell me a set of tires or pay for services.  WOW, what a surprise, they simply put air in my tires, did an inspection and told me my tires were just fine. NO CHARGE!!!  The change in temperature was to blame for the pressure light coming on.  WHAT???  YOU ARE NOT trying to sell me something I don't need!?  You have no idea what it feels to walk away from a auto shop and feel that they are being honest.  They now have a tire customer for life.

Love the food!  I always order the pomegranate chicken salad, with a side of bread and make my own pomegranate chicken sandwhich.  More often than none the service is great, however everyone once in a while you get the "Im too cool to work here and serve you" attitude.  Minor annoyance, worth living through for the food.

Okay, as far a great produce and specialty foods and snack, Sprouts has Trader Joes beat.  This place is amazing.  The deli is home to the $2.99 sandwich.  The BEST sandwhich shop in Phoenix.   The best part of the widest selection of produce and snacks are the prices!  I am over the snobish Trader Joes crowd, their long lines.  This place has everything you need.

In my opinion, this is one of the best "healthy" alternatives for fast food.  The chicken is amongst the freshest and most flavorful, without being deep friend.  The greek salas with chicken is a must!   Delish and nutrish!

WOW, I have a rental in Phoenix and needed to have doors re-keyed.  Jeff answered immediately, returned phone calls promptly and made a  service appt the next day.  His rates were very reasonable.  He also fixed door knobs in an 80 year old house that I thought were going to cost a fortune to fix.  HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend A-1 key service.   Honest, good work and low-rates.

Okay, I don't get why there is so much criticism regarding this joint.  The minute I walked in I was treated with that southern hospitality that I have learned to expect in Charlotte. So this is not Ruth Chris, however I can say the steak entrees I saw looked amazing, my burger was the best that I have had in a LONG time.  Seriously, fresh hand made patty grilled to order and so flavorful! * nom nom nom*. I almost ordered another one.  The girls that were work here are not only adorable (think kittens with a ball of yarn), but super sweet and attentive. Bonita was my server tonight and she was anything but mediocre. She dazzled me the minute I sat down. This place is authentic as it gets in terms of "mom and pop" steak houses. I"ll take Carolinas Steak House over the Outback, LoneStar or any other pretentious chain.  If you want a great meal and FANTASTIC service, look no further than this quaint little place.  And for the critics who think this place has bad service, try finding this kind of (sincere) hospitality in any other joint in the country! Thanks Bonita!

Great service, I asked to resize my ring, did it on the spot, and allowed me to take it home before payment.  I love supporting local businesses, especially the mom and pops!  Highly recommend!  Oh, they have the best selection of turquoise jewelry.

Living in chicago I still keep my uniform peices to bring in.  I absolutely love this place.  Leslie, one of the young girls that works the front remembers me by name.  I just love that kind of customer service!  I have never, ever had issues and have been using this place for years.

oops, I forgot to review Brian!  I have been with him since 2005 and he and his staff have been amazing with adjusting my policy over the years to fit all my major life events.  I was referred to him by a friend,  I have only been to the office once and everything I have ever needed has been done over the phone or via email.  It seems I am always misplacing my insurance cards and I have to call to get replacements.  I usually  have an email within minutes of my call with replacement cards.  Best service, super friendly and always professional.  Oh... and he is hottie!  Can I say that?  ;-)

I have been here several times over the course of a year.  The food is really good, great service.  One of the best hamburgers I have ever had.   The macaroni and cheese is to die for, so leave the diet behind.

Found Chris on Angieslist, (can I say that?) with rave reviews, and he has turned out to be a gem.  He is punctual, does a thorough job and is friendly and personable.  His rates are very reasonable.  He did a bunch of little odd jobs as well a few big ones, to include installing outdoor speakers.    Would highly recommend him.   My only question is... why doesn't he wear his kilt?  ;-)

Absolute disaster.   It was not that busy, people waiting and standing for anyone to not only greet but to be seated as well.  Food is good but not worth the horrible service.  It felt like only one person was working even though I saw a full staff.  This is my last time.  Save yourself the trouble and eat across the street at Twin Peaks.

WHY these folks haven't been reviewed already is beyond me, perhaps they are a little secret!  I have been using this plumber for over a year for plumbing in my home, rentals and my mothers home.  These are the plumbers we all dream about.  They are professional and fair!  I have been ripped off way too many times over the years by commercial plumbers.  I can assure you that you will NEVER use another plumber after you use these guys.  I PROMISE!

Saw this place on 16th street, have been wanting to try it for some time.  I walked in on a Tuesday night, it was rather quiet.  I noticed a young girl texting on her phone when I walked in, I was surprised that she didn't see me walking in waiting to greet me.  I walk up to the counter and she gets off of the beer boxes she was sitting on, only then does she greet me.  Ay, kids!  Anyway, I ordered the Chicken pita sandwich with a salad.  I will say that the pita bread was SO GOOD!  The chicken was grilled, just a little dry, but otherwise good.  The vibe is cool and clean.  Im surprised it didn't have more people.  I will be coming back.

Have you ever shown up unannounced to someones house right in the middle of a domestic dispute. No? Well, neither have I, But I would imagine the awkward, unwelcomed "you came at a bad time" feeling is similar to what we felt/experienced.   We enter the establishment to not be greeted by the greeter, but rather were told the "real" host will seat us.  The real host showed up, but rather than say "Hi, welcome" we were handed off to someone else.  It was very awkward as though we were being handed off because we were came at a bad time. We were seated in the bar area, obviously new to the place, so a little lost.  No one, not one person  welcomed us but more importantly no one explained the restaurant, its concept or the menu. Hey folks, new restaurant its probably a good idea to greet and ask "have you been here before?" and follow up with a brief explanation of what we should expect.  Total disaster.
