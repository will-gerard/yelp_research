I may not know the players names or even some of the rules, but I love live sports!  Maybe I just like an excuse to yell and clap with others.  In the past year I have tried all three flavors of seating while cheering on the Suns:  Box Suite - perfect for the lazy among us.  Lots of seating and a couple of TVs too.  The food and drinks are stocked by your Suite Attendant (sweet!) so your next refreshment is never more than 10 steps away.  Each box also has a private restroom (yay!).  No need to stand in line to tinkle with the masses.  Lexus Club - semi-private boxes (closer to the court than the box suites) and a buffet-style food spread that isn't anything you would expect from a sports venue.  Carving stations, salads, pasta and swanky cheeses.  No paper plates & plastic cups here...  Great for people watching - the ice cream sundae line starting in the 3rd period can really bring out the ugly in some...  Seriously.  Regular Seats - closest to the game (which I like), but also closest to everyone else.  The crowd can be really enthusiastic - depending on how the game is going you may find yourself being high-fived or even hugged by strangers.  Not.  Always.  A.  Good.  Thing.  I have seen some cool things here, including a man win $77,777 for sinking a basket from center court "granny style".  Overall a good arena (especially when the tix are free!).    :)

Location, location, location...  Yes, the type of service you receive at Rosita's all depends upon where you sit.  My experience:  4 visits sitting in the bar = great service.  1 visit sitting in the dining room = painfully slow service.  So, the bar is definitely the way to go, and not just because it offers closer access to the margaritas.  ;)  Now that we have that out of the way, let me tell you about the three main reasons I love Rosita's:  Hot, salty tortilla chips with spicy salsa - the perfect starter that sets up the appetite perfectly for...  Powerful and potent margaritas - the super nice female bartender is not skimpy on the tequila in these!  And, best of all, the most wonderful carne asada burro I have ever experienced.  This is not your average burro with a bit of meat and lots of 'filler' - rice, etc.  No, this is an enormous tortilla packed with meat, meat and more meat!  If you get it enchilada-style like I do, it will be topped with a delightfully messy mix of cheese and red sauce.  Bite after bite of goodness!  So, clear your afternoon (those margaritas pack a kick!), grab a friend or two and get going!

Walking into PCG on a recent Sunday for brunch, I wasn't sure what to expect.  The place was pretty much empty.  Coming off a few less than stellar recent brunch attempts at other local spots (why is it so hard to find good Eggs Benedict!?), I took this to be a less than favorable sign about the meal ahead...    Well, I was wrong...  PCG served some of my favorite things!  A mimosa with fresh-squeezed OJ started things off nicely.   :)   On to an appetizer - yes, even brunch deserves an appetizer!  I was happy to see Jumbo Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp on the menu.  Now that Wildfish no longer serves them, I have been hunting for a new favorite.  These were delicious - 4 large shrimp, stuffed with cojita cheese and wrapped in bacon - perfect with the accompanying chipotle-lime aioli.  And last, the main event.  The Tenderloin Eggs Benedict was fantastic.  Two English muffins graced with generous slices of medium-rare tenderloin, poached (not overdone - hooray!) eggs and tangy hollandaise.  This masterpiece came with diced breakfast potatoes (not greasy at all!) and a small bowl of fresh fruit.  Yum!    Thank you, PCG, for renewing my faith in brunch.

There was an ice sculpture.  A Yelp ice sculpture that rotated.  Do I really need to say anything else?  Yes - I absolutely have to say more!  From the delicious food to the outstanding service the entire afternoon really made us feel welcome.  It was an added bonus to see Gabi's smiling face at the check-in table!  A highlight was being able to speak with Jennifer, Capital Grille's amazing chef.  She took the time to explain the beef aging process (CG has their own aging room there at the restaurant!), as well as to provide a few tips on what to look for when selecting beef for cooking at home.  I am very proud of myself that I had the restraint to not cram that entire display tenderloin into my purse and run out the door!    A huge Thank You to the amazing staff at the Capital Grille and to resident Yelp Rockstar Lindsey for hosting such a fantastic event.

It isn't trendy.  It isn't fancy.  The chef isn't famous.  It is just plain good.  I like Red Devil.  It is one of those places where ordering way too much pizza on purpose in order to enjoy it again for lunch the next day is perfectly normal and A-OK.  The service is consistently friendly, attentive, and happy to offer menu suggestions.    I can't comment on their wide variety of main dishes (which all look appetizing), because I can never tear myself away from the pizza.  What goes great with that pizza?  The Antipasto salad is fantastic - loaded with meats, cheese and even my favorite artichoke hearts.  A small is more than ample for two people to share.  Save some of that Italian dressing (presented on the side) to use as a dipping sauce for your pizza crust.  Instant breadsticks!  Speaking of pizza, Red Devil's graces a thin yet doughy crust with tangy sauce and generous evenly-distributed toppings.  My favorite, pepperoni and mushroom, tastes wonderful when re-heated for lunch the next day too!  Go, sit in one of the bar's padded booths.  Enjoy an adult beverage or two (there are typically drink specials of some kind or another) and order a pizza big enough to take some home.  :)

Ick.  It was one of those evenings when you toss dinner options back and forth, but nothing really sticks.    In retrospect, we should have stayed home.  Even in the barren, food-less space that is my kitchen, I could have done better.  However, lured by an ad boasting a "World Famous Gyro" for the bargain price of $5, off we went.  Upon arrival, we were quickly greeted by a man I assume is the owner, shown to a table, and given menus.  A few minutes later, he came back to tell us he would send someone over to take our order.  Great.  Strangely, the waitress that arrived to ask us what we would like to drink couldn't/wouldn't take our food order, as someone else was actually our waiter.  Huh?  Well, we finally were able to order from our real waiter (who was very nice, by the way and the ONLY reason for 2 stars vs 1) and our World Famous Gyros arrived shortly.    Uh, no.  What I found on my plate was a pile of sauce wrapped in paper.  The entire gyro was drowning in tzatziki.  Now I happen to really like tzatziki, but but not to the point that I cannot even identify what I am supposed to be eating.  I scraped off as much as I could, but then only tasted overly salty meat, soggy lettuce and yes, sauce.  After a few bites, I waved the white flag of surrender - I just couldn't do it.  Guess you get what you pay for....

What can make a long and frustrating day better (other than a lot of liquor)?  Treating yourself to a mani/pedi!  Not knowing where to go, I simply selected the first place I saw on my route home that looked open.  Lucky me - I ended up at Paradise Nails!  I knew I was in the right place when I came in the door - they use quality Opi products and the salon is very clean.  The pedicure was one of the best I have ever had, complete with a nice long relaxing foot/leg massage.  I walked in tired and cranky, and walked out feeling like a million bucks (for only $31 + tip)!  I will definitely be back!!

Sometimes it seems that during my 'home improvement' projects, I break more than I fix.  Nothing says 'fun' quite like that drip irrigation system that leaks.  And leaks...  Fortunately, there are places like Sprinkler World to help me undo the damage I cause.    Typically I bring in a sample of what needs to be replaced (irrigation tubing, parts for outdoor lighting, etc.) and the knowledgeable staff easily matches the size/type with what I need.  They will also test parts to see if they can be repaired.  When I brought in my broken irrigation timer, I learned I could just purchase one component, rather than replacing the whole unit.  Nice!  Helpful advice = happy me.  I will be back as soon as I break something else.

Another beautiful day, and another new-to-me hiking spot to love - the Alta Trail!  I have been on other trails in South Mountain Park (Mormon, National), and this one is now my favorite.  The first time my friend and I tried to get here, a most disappointing barrier and sign informed us that the access road to the trailhead is only open the first weekend of each month, 5am - 3pm.  Doh!  Fast forward a couple of weeks for the second attempt and trust me, it was worth waiting for!  The trail is well-maintained, and not crowded, either (bonus!).  The fairly challenging elevation gain (over 1,100' in the first mile - AAAAGH!) includes many switchbacks, and a few sections where I had to use my hands to get over some larger rocks.  Maybe these trails need height requirements, like at Disneyland...  The scrape/bruise I still have on my left shin proves that I should have spent less time "sightseeing" and more time watching where I was going.  Oops...  I consider it a Badge of Honor.    At the top, the reward was clearly obvious - outstanding views of the Phoenix skyline and the Estrella Mountains.  Note:  this is the part where you use the "hey, let's take some photos" excuse to pause and catch your breath!  Mark your calendar - first weekend of the month... go!

Whenever I feel too land-locked and forget what the ocean looks like, I head off to Islands.  Maybe it has something to do with the freaky-tiki kind of decor, or the surf videos that play constantly.  I Like It Here.  Yes, it is a chain.  Yes, it is smack in the middle of the Desert Ridge Marketplace.  No, I don't care.  Islands restaurants are everywhere in So Cal, and they are all consistently good for a casual meal.  I was happy to see that there is a location in Desert Ridge - nice and close to me!  The service is friendly and attentive - you aren't left panting for a drink refill.  My faves are the North Shore tacos and the Sandpiper chicken breast sandwich.  If you are in the mood for some bad for you goodness, definitely try the cheddar fries.  A plate laden with their fresh-cut fries just covered with cheddar cheese and chives.  Served with ranch dressing, it is artery-hardening perfection.  Who needs a fork!?  Just use your fingers!!

This is a strange little complex of stores that calls itself an outlet mall.  With the exception of a newer section tacked on one end that houses Banana Republic, Gap and J. Crew, it seems a bit shabby and outdated.  The other tenant stores were just mediocre - really, do you need more than one Sunglass Hut location in a complex that isn't that big?  Also, looking at some of the pricing, I have found that there are better deals to be had in the full-price, non-outlet versions of these stores and the quality is better, too.        In order to end on a positive note, there is covered parking...

While I love each and every visit to Casella's, today was something special - Casella's was celebrating an anniversary - 34 years in business!!  There is something to be said about good food and a friendly atmosphere that stands the test of time.  It is easy to see why this family-run business has been open for 34 years and counting.  Since first discovering this local gem with my Favorite Yelper a few months ago, I have lost count of the number of visits we have made.  Each and every time, we are greeted like family.  Denise even remembers our order!  Well, to be honest, every customer is greeted like family.  That is one of the many reasons we can't stay away.  The decor is unpretentious, and the wood-paneled, nostalgia-filled walls tell the story of years of being a staple in the community.  Don't be surprised if you are offered a taste of whatever is being sliced behind the counter - thank you again Joe, for that Provolone!  :)  Ready to taste a little bit of heaven?  Order the Hot Italian Beef with Provolone.  Served on a soft yet slightly crisp roll with a side of Au Jus, I struggle to find words to describe how good this sandwich is.  Just try it.  You won't be sorry.    Maybe money can't buy you love, but it can get you a fantastic meal - Casella's is cash-only.  I have decided that I want to be adopted by the Casella family.  Sorry mom, but if you ever taste one of Casella's sandwiches, you will understand...

What a fantastic idea - underwater pool repairs!  My pool had two icky rust spots from rebar - not what I want to look at while enjoying an afternoon dip.  It seemed that my only option was to drain the pool and have the plaster repaired.  Expensive and inconvenient, not to mention I don't really like the idea of wasting water.  Fortunately, I stumbled upon an ad for Underwater Operations - lucky me!.  John the owner is really nice - he came out and quickly diagnosed my problem and provided a very fair estimate for the repairs.  Basically he uses scuba gear and a special material to do all the work underwater - cool!  My pool looks great and I'm ready for the weekend!

Thank you, for treating me like a criminal.  Once upon a time, I purchased a beautiful pair of Cole Haan boots from here.  OK, it was two pairs but who's counting?  However, when I tried to repeat that lucky find on another visit, things went downhill fast.  After wandering through and finding nothing worth even trying on, I headed out the door at the same time that a man (who I think works there) with a large box was coming in.  The security alarm went off, but since I didn't touch/linger over/try on/purchase anything I paused briefly then just kept walking.  Mistake.  The woman behind the counter ran out of the store yelling "you need to come back in here RIGHT NOW!".  Ummm... people are staring... I go back inside with her, and she gives me a kind of up-down look and says she has to see the inside of my purse.  I can't hold it open and let her see, she has to take it from me and paw through it on the counter.  Really?  You think I took something?  The outfit I am wearing (grown-up business clothes, by the way) is fitted and does not have pockets and the purse (not one of my usual suitcase-sized bags) is very small.  Where, exactly, did she think I was hiding merchandise?  Did I somehow fit a pair of stilettos in my bra?  WTF!?  Finding nothing, she proceeds to lecture me on the importance of removing the magnetic security tags from inside clothing since they set off her alarm.  Um, I don't have any of those but gee, thanks for the helpful information.  Hmmm... do you think maybe the guy coming in with the box set off your alarm and not me?    There are plenty of other places to feed my footwear habit without being completely embarrassed.

At first I was happy to find a dry cleaning shop that was on my route to/from work and had good prices.  The whole pay in advance thing and only accepting cash or debit card (with a 50 cent charge for debit) was a litte inconvenient, but that was OK.  The first few batches of items I brought in came out great, but then the quality started to go downhill.  I finally gave up on this place when 3 separate batches of items I brought in came back wrinkled, like they were not pressed completely.  Even the simple items like pencil skirts looked like they hadn't been touched at all.  Huh?  A low price is not really a bargain if I have to iron everything again myself once I get home.  Thanks but no thanks!

La cena era deliziosa!  The meal was delicious!  I love Italian food, and when I am lucky enough to visit somewhere that does it really well, I am in my own version of Heaven.    The experience started off with the shrimp scampi appetizer - large shrimp served in a light lemon white wine butter sauce with just the right amount of garlic.  Next came the best ravioli I have ever tasted.  Delicate thin pasta surrounded ricotta cheese and spinach, and was topped with a cream and tomato sauce.  Simple, classic and oh so very good!  My friend had the linguine with clams in white wine garlic sauce which was also fantastic.  Did we save room for dessert?  Heck yes!  The tiramisu was the perfect finish.  Hands down the best Italian I have had since moving to AZ.  Try it, you'll like it too!!

When I first moved to AZ, I recall driving by this store and saying to myself "Seriously? A whole store for just batteries?  Who would shop there?"  Well, me.  I have been to Batteries Plus twice now, and both times have quickly been helped to find exactly what I needed.  The first time was for a replacement battery for the timer that runs my outside lighting.  It is just creepy to come home to a dark entryway.  I thought a replacement would be simple to find, but nooooooo... four stores later and no luck it was Batteries Plus to the rescue.  Ta da!  Let there be light!  Last weekend my garage door remote decided to stop working.  Funny how pressing the button harder and waving it around didn't seem to help.  Yep, dead battery.  This time I wasn't even going to bother searching all over for a replacement.  A quick stop at BP and the new battery was installed.  The man who helped me even tested my old one first to be sure that the battery was the problem, and not my garage door opener.  Now that is thorough!  The world is an imperfect place.  Batteries die.  I am sure I will be back.

Just when I thought I would never find good sushi in AZ (and I have really, really tried) I walked into Hiro.  I heard the banter in between the sushi chefs in Japanese and knew I had found what I had been looking for.  Yes!  A REAL Japanese sushi restaurant.  I have been there three times now, and have loved every visit.  It is a place to eat and enjoy the food, not a strangely-lit cocktail lounge pretending to be a sushi bar.  The fish is fresh, the edamame is warm and salty, and the beer is cold.  What else can you ask for?  Thank you Hiro Sushi!

When I first moved to AZ, I lived at the Gainey Suites for a little over a month.  I became a bit spoiled - who doesn't like fresh towels and having the bed made every day?  :)  While I was expecting a typical sterile "extended stay" type place, I was pleasantly surprised.  My recently remodeled room had a full kitchen, tasteful furniture, very comfy bed and nice flat screen TVs.  The staff, services and amenities were all great.  The pool/spa area was always clean and had a good supply of large fluffy towels.  The gym, while small, had a flat screen TV as well as individual TVs on the cardio equipment (cool!).  To balance out the gym, there was no shortage of food on the property - continental breakfast was served every morning, fresh Paradise Bakery cookies could be found at the front desk, and snacks, beer and wine were offered each evening.  It was nice after a long day at work to enjoy some wine by the outdoor fire pit.  Overall the Gainey Suites helped to make my transition to AZ a good one.

Knowing my love of pizza and my search for an AZ favorite, a co-worker highly recommended that I try Ray's.  Wanting to to see if the pizza was really as good as he claimed, I braved the never-ending strip mall/parking rodeo that houses this location and oh, I am so glad I did!  Walking up to the door, I nearly swooned over the beautiful aroma of baking crust, garlic and red sauce.  For me, it holds the same allure that "new car smell" holds for guys.    Inside is even better!  It is kind of a controlled chaos near the entry - lots going on but somehow it all works.  The guys behind the counter were taking orders, handing out food and working 5 ovens that I could see at the same time - very impressive!  Initially I was just going to try a slice, but decided I needed a whole pie all to myself!  It was ready quickly, and I am very proud of myself that I did not immediately rip the box open in the parking lot.  I managed to wait until I got home to savor the flavor!  Of course I went with the pepperoni and mushroom new place test combo and I was very happy.  Even reheated for lunch the next day, very tasty.  Yay!

I like pretty much any shopping opportunity, but this collection of outlets intermixed with a few 'regular' stores, cell-phone and lotion kiosks, was just...  depressing.   With a few exceptions, a majority of the retailers seemed to sell very similar merchandise (I counted 5 shops selling baseball caps) or things that were just plain strange (a chain-mail suit!?).  I suppose that would be great if you wanted one for an upcoming renaissance faire.  I am sure there were amazing deals to be had, but they simply eluded me.  Maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind to dig through mountains of merchandise.  I may return when I am feeling more 'adventurous'.  I add a star because it had A/C and my friend did find a very good deal on t-shirts.  Otherwise...

I love pizza.  I think it should be granted its own food group.    I typically don't care for places that serve pizza by the slice, becuase it tends to appear old and dry.  A little scary.  Not so at Venezia's!  Their pies are hot and fresh from the oven, and they are HUGE!  They yield beautiful slices of NY style pizza, with just the right amount of cheese & sauce.  I have never seen a slice of pizza so big.  So of course I had to have two.  Dangerously becoming a new lunch favorite!

"I've cut a bitch for less..."  This is the response I received from my Partner in Culinary Crime after demonstrating my mad chopstick skills to scoop up a wayward spicy scallop.   You see, the creations at Tokyo Lobby are worth fighting for.  Every last morsel.  Of course I am going to risk life and limb!!   :)  Before moving AZ, I was told by friends who were familiar with my sushi-loving ways that I had to try Tokyo Lobby.  Nearly two years later, it was finally time to take their advice - we headed west into the uncharted territory of... Glendale!  That first visit was spectacular, and since then we have been back multiple times for both lunch and dinner.  Sometimes twice in the same week - it is really that good.   We have tried a variety of items, but so far the favorites are:  - Hamachi Toro - yellowtail belly sashimi - Spicy Scallops - Chicago Roll - salmon on spicy crab and scallops - What the Heck Roll - I can only describe this as spicy tuna heaven, with some jalapeno tossed in just because it is fun...  Try any and all of these with their fresh wasabi and citrus-infused ponzu.  Amazing!!  Top this off with a large beer (Ichiban, please!) and hot sake for only $5.  From the fresh and perfectly prepared fish to the friendly and attentive owners and staff, a visit to Tokyo Lobby is really a pleasure.  If Glendale is not what immediately comes to mind when you think of sushi, it will be soon!    Tanoshinde!!

I've had fried chicken. I've had waffles. Who knew that they were really meant to be Together, on the Same Plate!?  Not me, at least until I was introduced to Lo-Lo's.    The Pilgrimage to this wee building on a small side street in downtown PHX was made on a cold, rainy Sunday - perfect weather for comfort food!   After strategic review of the menu consisting of a price volume mix analysis to determine the right combination of entrees and side items to reach Pareto Optimality, my friend and I ended up with a table full of goodness: Lo-Lo plate (2 waffles + 3 chicken breasts), 1 additional waffle, home fries and (no surprise here) mac n cheese.    The food arrived quickly (benefit of arriving right at opening time!), and this is where all conversation stopped.  No talking, just eating and lots of it.  I surfaced for air once or twice to mumble random things about how good everything was, but that's about it.  I don't know how the Lo-Lo's Chicken Magicians manage to make fried chicken that is not greasy - it is crispy on the outside but still tender and juicy on the inside.  The waffles taste slightly of cinnamon and I am not ashamed that I used the entire portion of butter that was riding on the top.  All of it.  Hard arteries are strong arteries, right?    Halfway through the mac n cheese I noticed the Red Rooster Louisiana Hot Sauce on the table - liquid fire!  Had to douse the remaining portion and feel the burn...  Yeah!!  OK Phoenix, I get it.  I know now what I have been missing all this time.  I will be back in about 4 months, when my cholesterol levels return to normal...  :)

Pho.  I've missed it since moving to Arizona.  Tragic, I know.  Recently I became fixated on it.  Had to have it.  For a week it was pretty much the only meal I could think about.  Where, oh where to get it in Phoenix?  Lucky for me, I know people.  People who know where to go to feed my need for Pho.  Da Vang!  Right when we walked into Da Vang, I knew it was going to be good.  It just looked, well, like it was supposed to.  A little worn, and more utilitarian than attractive - you know that everyone comes for the food, not the decor.  The menu is pretty extensive - almost overwhelming, and conveniently numbered for people like me who would butcher the pronunciation of the dishes.  I should have taken more time to review, but I was on a mission.  A Pho-king mission and I wasn't leaving without it.  To start, we enjoyed deliciously fresh spring rolls - one type with shrimp (#48) and the other with BBQ pork (#49).  Both were prepared with crisp refreshing mint leaves and went oh so well with the peanut dipping sauce.  Heaven!  The beautiful big bowl of seafood pho (#12) that was placed before me was well worth waiting for.  Oh!  Shrimp, crab, squid and more!  Bathed in a succulent broth and surrounded by a hearty portion of rice-stick (thin) noodles.  Love these!  Seeing my friend's noodle envy, I surrendered a portion to add to his Pho, which came with thicker noodles (and looked awesome, too).  I like the burn, so I heated up my broth with chili sauce, sriracha, lime juice and even a couple jalapeno slices.  After a few bites my lips were on fire - perfect!  My only regret is that there was no way that I could even consider dessert.  Physically impossible after all of the amazing food I had consumed.  I am sure they would have been good.  Well, I just have a reason to go back!  Well worth the drive.  Da Vang, I know where to find you now, and plan on seeing you often!

I like burgers.  I like cheesesteak.  I really, really like them together!  A Steakenburger is pretty much what the name implies - a burger, with steak and cheese.  Grilled rib eye, and provolone to be exact.  Oh, and lettuce and tomato so you can try and tell yourself you are getting in a serving of veggies.  Sounds a bit strange, but it will delight your inner carnivore!  Feeling extra hungry?  Go for the double, with two beef patties.  I like mine without the grilled onions.  Juicy, beefy goodness.    Unlike many fast food restaurants, where everything comes from a bag or can, Steakenburger tries to make many of their items in-house.  This includes creating fries by cutting Actual Potatoes and making their own chili (that takes 6 hours!).    Put those fries and chili to good use by ordering the chili cheese fries.  Plenty to share and made with your choice of cheddar cheese or cheez whiz (go for the cheddar!).  The chili is just how I like it, without beans.  The fries are a bit greasy, but let's be honest.  You are not visiting somewhere with a name like 'Steakenburger' because your cardiologist recommended it.    :)

"If you can't make out the Princess in this rock formation, remember we have a bar downstairs."  - words of wisdom from our Captain   :)  Taking a nature cruise on The Dolly is an enjoyable way to spend an afternoon.  I had a great time playing tourist!  First off, getting there is half the fun.  The drive provides some exciting twists and turns, as well as nice views of the Superstition Mountains.  There are a couple of spots along the way to stop and take photos as well.    The 1.5 hour cruise took us along some of Canyon Lake's most impressive rock formations and scenic areas.  The tour was informative, and was partially narrated by our captain, and partially a taped soundtrack.  I learned quite a few new things!    While bald eagles and bighorn sheep are common in the area, on this day we didn't see any wildlife, other than some really cute (and noisy!) ducks.      These cruises are popular, so it is a good idea to make a reservation - walk-up space isn't guaranteed.  Numbered boarding passes are distributed at check-in, so if you want your choice of seats, get there early.  The 2 levels provide more than enough space for everyone, with both indoor (air conditioned) and outdoor seating at shared tables.  We sat with a friendly group visiting from New Jersey - it was fun to listen to them comment on the 'strange plants' - yep, those are cactus!  If you want to show a visitor some of the more beautiful features of Arizona or just want to enjoy your own home state in a new way, take a cruise!

Based upon all the horror stories I was told prior to going, I was sure I was going to die, see a dead person, or both.  Or at a minimum come in contact with at least six horrifying water borne diseases.  Didn't happen.  I am pleased to say that not only am I still alive and kicking, my tubing experience was fun!  I was lucky to be with an experienced group, which I am sure helped since I had no idea what I was doing.  Basically you rent a tube, take a a wild and bumpy bus ride from the parking lot to the starting point, link up to your group (and oh so important cooler) with rope, hop in and get going!  The water was cool and clear, and the views of the canyon walls were gorgeous.  We even saw two groups of wild horses grazing along the river bank, an unexpected bonus!  What I learned:  - Go early - most likely my experience was as good as it was because the river wasn't crazy crowded during the time we were there - Bring a large towel to cover your tube.  They are black rubber and get toasty warm in the sun.  Also, the towel acts as a sling making the ride more comfortable - Don't bring anything that can't get wet  - Wear shoes - when exiting the river, the rocks are slippery! - Bring snacks, drinks, lots of water and sunscreen.  Rent a tube for your cooler! - Have a designated driver  Try it - you just might find you like it!

I have never been one of those girls who could keep a manicure looking good for more than a couple of days.  That is, until DeAnna worked her magic!    She didn't bat an eye when I showed her my ragged, desperately in need of attention nails.  She was not horrified as I explained that I needed to be able to do yardwork and all sorts of other things that would certainly immediately destroy any average manicure.  Her suggestion of using shellac polish was exactly what I needed.  Best of all, she didn't grab any scary drills or grinding tools.  Everything was done by hand, with simply a file, a buffing block and a cuticle stick.  Really!  When she was done, I didn't recognize my hands.  My nails were...  perfect!  And they stayed perfect for longer than I could have imagined.  This was seriously the everlasting manicure - that shellac would still be there if I did not remove it myself (she provided perfect instructions on how to do so without damaging my nails) after my nails grew out a bit.  In addition to the fantastic manicure I received, it was just plain fun to be there.  This is definitely not an anonymous, rushed, assembly line experience.  Rather, individual attention and great conversation in a beautifully appointed, spotlessly clean salon.  No more assembly line for me!  You will walk in a client, but walk out a friend.  :)

I have a bad habit of buying clothes without trying them on.  I just kind of hold up an item, determine it looks "about right" and call it good.  This is really not the best way to do things, I know.  As an example, I fell in love with a fantastic pair of jeans... last July.  It wasn't until I got them home that I realized that while they were the correct size, they were made for someone 6' tall (which I am definitely not).  Promptly exiled to the back of the closet.  I didn't get any taller in the past half year (darn!) and was about to give them away when I learned that they could be fixed to fit 5'5" me.  Sweet!  I can see why Fifth Avenue Alterations has so many 5-star reviews.  I brought in my amazon-girl jeans and the owner took a lot of time to ensure that they were pinned to exactly the correct length, having me stand both in heels and without shoes.  I like attention to detail!  She explained how the existing distressed hem would be cut and re-attached, so the bottom of the jeans wouldn't have that tacky folded-over look once they were finished (I never knew that could be done).  $20, done in a week and they look great!  I am very happy - these jeans are going to be my new favorites!

Visiting My Sister's Closet can be a hit or miss event.  On a particular day you may not find anything you like.  However, if you bring your patience and a sense of adventure you could find something fantastic!  While I have never had the opportunity to work my way through each rack and display case (but would like to someday!), I have found my favorite brand of jeans (7 for All Mankind) a couple of times at what I think is a great price.  I have brought in items to consign as well.  Once you establish an account, the process is fairly quick and easy.  I don't dwell on which items sell, or the price, since I would have otherwise donated the clothing.  Any store credit received is a fun bonus to me!  One piece of advice - try on everything - even if the label says it is your size, and it is a brand you are familiar with.  Jeans, especially the designer brands, have many times been altered by the previous owner for waist size or length (and all sales are final).  Happy hunting!!

I have been to NYPD a few times now, and have left happy each time.  The restaurant is a bit small, but the layout (with a small bar & a few tables upstairs) is fine if you don't have a large group.  The wait staff is laid back and friendly - attentive but not all over you, which I like.  The garlic knots with cheese are a great way to start a meal - golf ball sized twists of bread topped with melted mozzarella and served with marinara dipping sauce.  The thin crust pizzas are tasty with just the right amounts of cheese and sauce.  On a visit where I ventured away from pizza, I was very impressed by the shells florentine - large pasa shells filled with spinach & artichoke hearts, mixed with oh-so-melty cheese glorious cheese.   Have you noticed yet that I love CHEESE?  :)  Save room for the cookies & cream dessert - a freshly-baked chocolate chip cookie served topped with vanilla ice cream.  Mmmm...

I was looking forward to giving this Nick's a try, since I really enjoyed my meal at the Tatum & Shea location.  So, after a long long work day leaving me with no desire to cook (hey, wait - I never really want to cook...) - take-out, anyone!?  I called on the way home from work and by the time I got there my order was ready to roll.  I like when someone tells me that my food will be ready in 15 minutes and it actually is.  Yay!  The pizza (pepperoni and mushroom, of course) had a thin, but not too thin crust and good cheese/topping coverage.  The house salad was simple, cool and fresh.  While I haven't stayed here for dine-in (yet!) I was very happy with my take-out order.  Thanks Nick, for helping me to be lazy.  :)

Yum, yum and yum!  A neighbor introduced me to this gem and am I certainly appreciative!  This is not a bass-thumping sushi mega-factory, but a small inviting space where the food is the feature attraction.  Everything I tried was fresh and perfectly presented.  Five stars, easy!

Imagine my surprise and horror when I learned that the pretty green lawn that I had so patiently cared for during the baking summer was going to take a winter vacation and turn brown.  Dormant!?  What the heck is that?  Didn't I treat you right?  Didn't I bake out in the hot sun tending to your needs?  And to repay my efforts you will turn brown and icky!?  Apparently here in AZ you need "winter grass".  Huh?    Unable to accept months of brown desolation in the back yard I headed off to Ace to see what I could do.  No gardener for me!  I am going to Do This Myself!  This Ace location is great.  Not too big, but not too small either and staffed by employees who are happy to help.  Instead of being left to wander aimlessly, I was greeted at the door and escorted (not pointed to, or aimed at, but escorted!) directly to what I needed.  Michael was extremely helpful in explaining the (foreign to me!) process for prepping for and planting winter grass.  His recommendations were exactly what I was looking for and he didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need.  He even carried everything to the register and loaded the bags of seed and compost into my car for me.  Thanks!!    Now, let's just cross our fingers that I will have the greener grass this winter on MY side of the fence...

On the first day of sunshine after days of rain, it was time to go out and play!  Blue skies, puffy clouds and an entire day to do nothing but have fun. What more can you ask for?   My inaugural visit to Four Peaks was part of a multi-destination afternoon in and around Tempe. My friend, who spent a lot of Quality Time at Four Peaks while attending graduate school, was understandably horrified at my cultural black hole regarding such a time-honored establishment.  Don't hate - I'm from California!  So, after a huge lunch and a stroll around the ASU campus (taking pity on the hard-working MBA students in Saturday group meetings - oh, I remember that pain...) it was time to see what I had been missing.   I think I spend too much time in Scottsdale, because at first I was disoriented. The stand-alone building is nowhere near a strip mall. It isn't beige. The parking lot is filled with rocks and doesn't have clearly-defined parking spaces (I can never park between the lines anyway, so I was more than OK with this). Also, I didn't see a single Affliction t-shirt. Yay.   Both the front patio and interior were packed - I think this place has a license to print money.  Even with a full bar, I didn't see anyone without a pint glass - I am guessing not many mixed drinks are served here - lucky bartenders!  In addition to the printed menus, a large chalk board lists the beers on tap and the alcohol content of each - a range from 4% to an impressive 6.9% for the Raj IPA.   We didn't eat anything (no stomach real-estate left) but did enjoy a pitcher of Hefeweizen (hey, there is always room for that, right?). Sitting at the bar, I could see that this place appeals to a wide variety of people. To our left, a group of older guys watching basketball and eating burgers. To our right, a couple of recent ASU grads we chatted with who were contemplating life plans, law school, an upcoming trip to Southeast Asia and eating Thai hummus - lucky girls!  Maybe I need a new life plan...  :)  Good times - I really want to go back and try the spinach/artichoke dip. It looked SO good!

Is it a market with a dining area or a restaurant with a market?  Does it really matter?  It is just plain good!!  If you are looking for a no frills spot, Haji Baba is for you!  The small dining area is on the right side of the market, with a few tables even spilling out into the market itself.  It gets very busy during lunchtime, so arrive early or be prepared for a wait.    While the menu offers a variety of choices, being a creature of habit, I typically stick with what I know and love - the gyro sandwich.  Nice and simple - a hearty portion of gyro meat, cool lettuce, pickle, tomato and creamy tatziki enveloped in a large, soft pita.  All this goodness for $3.99.  Yes, really $3.99.  I can never finish it, even though I really, really try.  I also like their hummus (served with warm soft pita it is a great appetizer to share) as well as the spanakopita.  Actually, I have enjoyed everything I have tried.  So, you really can't go wrong.  The payment process is interesting - the waiter drops off a ticket stub at the table that you bring to the market register to pay.  If you are with a group, each person can pay separately by telling the cashier their items on the total ticket, which is nice.  And, if you happen to grab some of the tasty chocolate wafer cookies by the register to add to your bill, that is not a bad thing.  Be sure to ask for some delicious baklava to go!

My dog asked me to to write this review to tell you all how much she loves her Hale pet door.  Actually, we are both very happy.  Our experience with the company was great from start to finish.  The door was installed through the (stucco) wall, and the installer saved the neatly cut out portion in the event I (or the next homeowner) ever want to remove the door.  Speaking of installation, the process was clean, clean, clean!  I actually think he left the kitchen floor nicer than he found it!  :)  The door itself is very well constructed with two sturdy flaps to keep the cool air inside.  Of all the changes/improvements I have made to my home since I moved to AZ, this purchase has made me the happiest.  I don't have to worry about my furry friend languishing outside on a hot day.

Are we there yet?  I feel like we are driving to the other side of the world...   Until recently, the Coyotes were the only Phoenix-area pro sports team I hadn't seen live.  So, when the opportunity came to see my first game (and in a luxury box, too), of course I was in!  I just had no idea it would take so very, very long to get there from my Scottsdale office.   Aside from the distance, this is a nice facility.  It looks shiny and new - during my visit I was told that it was designed as a copy of the arena where the Minnesota Wild plays.  How's that for trivia!?  Since I tend to be "directionally challenged" I was especially appreciative of the helpful staff who pointed my group in the right direction including a hard-to-find elevator (why was I leading the way?  Oh yeah, because I am a girl and therefore will ask for directions...  thanks guys!).  The box was huge, well-appointed, and right at center ice for a perfect view of all the action.  Wooo violence!  :)  There was no shortage of food/drinks - my favorites were the fruit arrangement and the chocolate mousse and strawberry cheesecake desserts (topped with cute chocolate Coyotes logos).  The game itself unfortunately wasn't very exciting (Coyotes lost 3-1), and I was surprised at the emptiness of the arena overall.  The fans in attendance were enthusiastic, but I think well over half of the seats were empty - for a game with the #1 and 2 teams in the Pacific Division...  Great arena, but I wish it were closer - I didn't get home until nearly 11pm - soooo hard to get up early the next morning...

I was one of Those People who insisted I would never, ever go to Pizzeria Bianco.  I had no interest in waiting 3+ hours for the privilege of eating pizza.  Bah Humbug!  Wait...  what is this?  PB is open for lunch? On Saturdays?  Without a wait!?  OK, I take that all back.  Let's go!  On a recent Saturday we made our way to Heritage Square.  I approached the little restaurant/house building with a hefty dose of skepticism.  Could it really be *that* good?  The space is not very large, and was nearly full at 11:30.  Grabbing two open seats at the bar (with a great view of the wood-fired oven), we decided to try two pizzas:  Sonny Boy ($16) - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Sopressata (salami), Gaeta Olives.  As I am not a fan of olives, I asked for this to be served without them.  It was really just OK.  The crust was slightly overcooked making the edges more burnt than charred.  Also, it was sliced haphazardly, making the slices strange sizes and shapes.  I was not very impressed.  Until the second pizza arrived:  Biancoverde ($16) - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula. This was a very interesting and tasty pizza!  A perfect blend of cheeses and garlic.  The Arugula was a nice contrast to the perfect blend of cheeses and garlic.  And, unlike the Sonny Boy, this crust was delicious!  About a week later, I had the opportunity to enjoy a couple of other PB varieties (in addition to the Biancoverde) during lunch with a few (skeptical) co-workers:  Rosa ($13) - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios.  This sounds like a strange combination, but it works!  Wiseguy ($16) - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage.  Good, but did not take the place of the Biancoverde as my favorite.  It was fun to watch their nervous expressions at the sight of an arugula-covered pizza turn to smiles of delight at their first bites.  So, I am glad I finally gave PB a try.  Will I ever wait hours and hours for these pizzas?  No!  However, you may find me there at lunchtime, savoring a Biancoverde with a smile.

I finally got around to trying out Sapporo for happy hour last night.  During the month of June, they are offering HH pricing all the time - great for those of us that work some strange hours and can't always get were we want to go by 7pm!    Even though it was a Tuesday, the place was packed - fantastic people watching.  While there were plenty of people who were there only to be seen (look at me!  look at my outfit!) there were also those who looked like they came out after work.  Our waitress was awesome - she was covering portions of both the indoor bar area and the patio and she was totally on top of our orders.  Thanks!  The HH prices were very good - $4-$8 for most sushi rolls and $6 for my oh so tasty white cosmo.  For that price, of course I had to have more than one!

For years, no visit to Vegas was complete without a visit to the Palm.  It was a tradition I looked forward to, especially the lobster bib!  Until now.  Thank you, Palm, for providing the worst dining experience I have experienced in Las Vegas.    Ever.  From the pompus, rude 'gentleman' at the host desk (thank you for turning your back on my mom while she was asking you a question - way to make the guests feel special!) to the rushed and perfunctory service from our waiter you have more than assured me that I will never again set foot in this establishment.  The highlights included:  - The most indifferent and rude 'greeting' from the excuse of a person at the host stand. Yes, Mr. Personality, I DO have a reservation. - No greeting from our waiter - he merely opened his notebook and asked what we wanted.  Were there specials? Anything we should be aware of on the menu? We will never know. - The waiter bringing me the wrong wine selection twice and then arguing with me about what I actually ordered.  I had to show him both the name and number on the wine list - twice.  I did eventually receive what I requested - a small miracle. - The same waiter slamming down our shrimp cocktail (presented slapped on a bed of lettuce rather than in the standard iced bowl, with only four on the plate rather than the usual five) and salads (a three year old could have made these look better) at the same time on the table while mumbling that they were 'busy'. - I had to ask for water, bread and yes, even a FORK. - Lobster should not be served partially raw.  No.  I could go on, but writing this just makes me annoyed all over again.

I think I can see my house from here...    Well, probably not, but I did enjoy the panoramic view of Phoenix from the top of Camelback!     My intention was to do the Summit (Echo Canyon) trail, but even though it was pretty early the line of cars waiting to park reminded me of a gym with valet parking.  Oxymoronic, or just stupid?  Of course I had not researched other parking options, so off to the Cholla trail I went.  The first part of the hike was a quick half-mile walk from the car on Invergordon to the trailhead, since closer parking isn't allowed.  A good opportunity to warm up before starting the 3+ mile round trip.  The majority of the trail wasn't too difficult - a clearly marked steady climb, alternating between switchbacks and straight areas.  The views were breathtaking.  The real fun started about 1 mile from the trailhead.  This is what I came for!  Boulders to scramble, and the way up marked by blue dots spray-painted onto the rocks.  This was my favorite part, even though I am not exactly a fan of heights and some of the narrower areas were tricky (visions of me possibly just sliding down the side... ick).  At the top, I took some time to enjoy my reward - a 360 degree view from the highest point in Phoenix.     Next time, Echo Canyon.  I just have to get up a little earlier!

I am proud to say that I have hiked the Echo Canyon side of Camelback a few times now, and have not died (yet)...  Surprisingly, it does get a wee bit easier each time.  At least this is what I tell myself.  The route can be thought of as separate sections, each with different challenges.  First, a series of railroad ties forming stairs that lead up, up, up.  Just when those get tedious, up ahead are two sections of handrails.  Yes, handrails that will assist in traveling over some fairly slick rock sections.  After that, there are three steep rocky areas that require a little bit of concentration to find the best way up - a nice manicure is wasted on me - I have to use my hands!  The views just after sunrise are breathtakingly beautiful, and well worth the effort of the climb and descent.  An amazing way to start the day (especially if you have a big 'ol brunch afterward!).  Will I win any speed or grace awards?  No.  Do people running up and down (multiple times) intimidate and motivate me?  Yes.  Someday I will channel my 'inner mountain goat' too...  Arrive early, bring water, be safe and enjoy one of my favorite things.

First off, as a Craftsman bungalow turned restaurant, Cibo is adorable and full of character.  I especially like the patio - a pleasing combination of plants, trees, fire pit and twinkle lights.  Ahhh... atmosphere!  My friends and I had no problem getting a great table at around 7pm on a Wednesday.  After enjoying a little Pinot Noir, we started off with the Schiacciata Romagnola appetizer (say that 10 times fast!).  It is a sort of flatbread, surrounding thick fresh mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, and greens.  Spectacular wood-fired goodness!  Although everything we had was great, this appetizer was for me the highlight.  Next, the pizzas:  Quattro Formaggi (a "white" pizza with fontina, parmigiano, pecorino, gorganzola, mozzarella) and Prosciutto Crudo (a "red" pizza with tomato sauce & mozzarella, topped with prosciutto after the pizza is cooked).  Both were excellent - thin (but not cracker-like) crust with just the right amounts of cheese (read:  a lot!).  The portion sizes are quite large - two people could easily split a pizza and not leave hungry.  Since we did not have dessert on this visit (darn!), I need to go back soon, and try one of the crepes that looked SO very good.    I am a sucker for a good patio.  Pair that with good food and tasty wine and I am beyond happy.  Cibo, even though you are nowhere near where I live or work, I love you anyway.

Why am I updating my review?  Dessert!  It finally happened!  I really enjoy introducing people to places they have never been, and I am happy to say Cibo recently gained two new fans of their charming outdoor patio and good food.  The three of us arrived just before the 5pm opening to ensure we could secure a table on the patio and enjoy the gorgeous first evening of Spring outside.  Everything we tried was fantastic, and I had the opportunity to sample two new-to-me dishes, the burrata appetizer (I have no words to describe how special and good this mozzarella is, especially when combined with the salty prosciutto, and a drizzle of aged basalmic) and dessert!         After selecting a chianti and the burrata, we decided to share two pizzas among us - the margherita and the rustica.  Both were excellent, with that slightly doughy wood-fired crust I love so much.  Ah, the dessert.  I think the trick to getting dessert with any meal is dining with guys.  There is no dainty "oh no, I just couldn't eat another bite" but rather "which one do you want?".  I like that.  We chose the Nutella and Marscapone cheese crepe, which was topped with a light dusting of powdered sugar and chocolate sauce.  So good, so worth waiting for - like hot chocolate, but on a plate.  Manners and politeness went out the door as our three forks fought for position.  I believe insults were thrown.  It is all fun and games until you get between me and some warm Nutella.  Back away slowly and you won't get hurt...  ;)

Yay!  I'm a fan!  I have been meaning to try this spot for quite a while and finally made it in on a slow Sunday.  Since I was a newcomer, Erica behind the bar shared some background info on the restaurant, including the coal oven and the filtration process used so that the water for the dough is as close to New York water as you can get in AZ.  Maybe just a gimmick, but I admit, I was impressed.    I decided upon a small caesar salad and a personal white pizza with garlic.  Oh was I surprised when a huge salad arrived - more than enough for two people.  That is a small!?  Yep.  I already could see a to-go container in my future.  It was very good - crisp crutons and just enough dressing.  The pizza arrived quickly and was also very big - the menu states the personal pizzas are 12", but it appeared larger to me - six slices of gooey, cheesy garlicy goodness atop a wonderfully crisp crust.    I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch, and had lots left over to take home.  It was probably a good thing that I was dining alone, because I am sure that I had major garlic breath after!

Life as I know it will never be the same.  This was my thought the first time I tried the decadent luxury known as Lobster Mac n Cheese at the Capital Grille.  It is really that good.  I could visit there and just order that - that is, if If the rest of the menu wasn't so fantastic.  Each and every item I have tried has been great - among my favorites have been:  - French Onion Soup - this is a HUGE portion, with just the right amount of cheese blanketed over the top.  - Lobster Bisque - um, it has Lobster in it!  What else can I say!?  - Wedge Salad - the Applewood Smoked Bacon really makes this stand out  - Filet Mignon - I am really picky about how my filet is prepared (between Medium and Medium Rare) and they get it right each and every time.  - Lobster Mac ' Cheese - you really need to try this for yourself.  The portion of lobster is generous - not little wimpy pieces, but large chunks of succulent meat, including claws!  Want to really go over the top?  Order a 1/2 or full pound of crab legs for the table to go with your meal!  They are served shelled, so all you have to do is enjoy.   The service has been attentive without being overwhelming, which is nice.  Also, the wine list is impressive, with choices in a variety of price points.  Is this the most budget-friendly meal you will ever have?  No.  Will you be insanely happy you treated yourself to a wonderful experience?  Absolutely!!

Brunch, Lunch, Dinner or Happy Hour - Sierra Bonita Grill does EVERYTHING well!  Among my favorite items:  Fresh Squeezed Margarita - served in a martini glass, this is really something special.  No icky sweet pre-made mix here - just a wonderful blend of Reposado tequila, orange liqueur, fresh lime juice and agave nectar.    Bacon wrapped shrimp - among the very best I have tasted, the four large shrimp make a gorgeous presentation atop the plate drizzled with barbecue sauce along with a side of a slightly spicy remoulade.  Amazing.   Southwestern Benedict - there is no better reason to have brunch.  Two green chile beer biscuits are topped with savory ham, panko crusted poached eggs (sounds weird, they are delicious!) and roasted poblano hollandaise.    I can't stay away from Sierra Bonita - the friendly staff and fantastic food never disappoints.  Ever!

While I have been to a few Fleming's locations for dinner, up until last week I had never experienced Happy Hour.  What was I thinking!?    Fleming's HH by the numbers:  3 categories (mixed drinks, wine & appetizers) featuring 5 items for $6 each, 7 nights a week until 7pm.  A great way to take in the refined and inviting Fleming's atmosphere and eat/drink very well.  On this particular evening, my friend and I enjoyed some HH offerings, and a couple items from the "regular" menu:  Starting off with wine, we chose the Belle Glos "Meiomi" Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir.  While the HH wines are very good (on a previous visit I had the Pillar Box Shiraz - yum!) it was well worth departing from the HH list for this one.  Hey, it's Thursday... *  Tenderloin Carpaccio.  In a word, magnificent.  Beautiful thin slices of beef topped with just the right amount of aioli and capers.  Perfect when topped with freshly-squeezed lemon juice and enjoyed on small slices of parmesan-topped toasted bread.  Oh!  Chipotle Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese.  This is a side item from the dinner menu.  While "not a mac n cheese person" my friend humors my addiction to this cheesy treat.  This one was special - easily one of the best I have tasted.  The cheese had a slightly smoky flavor, with a hint of spiciness that wasn't overpowering.  It was just right - I didn't even want to add my usual Tabasco...  and that says a lot.  Wicked Cajun Barbecue Shrimp.  While this was very, very tasty, the allure for me wasn't really the shrimp, but the SAUCE!  A captivating blend of hot chili spice, garlic, more garlic, butter and a few other magical ingredients I couldn't identify.  No vampires were coming near us after this!  We dipped our bread in it.  I could have eaten it with a spoon.  Seriously.  When do you go to HH at the same place twice in one week?  When it is Amazingly Good!!  There are still items I need to try - seared ahi, I am coming back for you...  * Two things You Should Know:  1) In the event (gasp!) you don't finish a bottle of wine at the restaurant, they can "re-cork" it so it can be legally taken home to enjoy later.  Nice if you don't want to purchase by the glass.  2) Get there early - the cozy booths in the bar area go fast!  Actually, wait...  Don't get there early.  Otherwise, I won't get a good seat.  :)

I cannot think of enough terrible things to say about their reservation system at this location.  I was a huge fan of Flemings and a very loyal customer, until now.  The complete lack of customer service and obvious practice of over booking reservations is beyond disappointing.  Looking forward to a nice dinner?  Bring your patience (and a snack).

After a Sunday afternoon of sun and fun at a Spring Training game, my friend and I were kind-of, sort-of, well not really anywhere near Bobby Q.  OK, we were west of the 17 freeway, so I suppose that counts as "near".  In any event, since missing out on the UYE the previous week, I was happy to visit this new-to-me BBQ spot for a very late lunch/early dinner.  We were seated immediately, and started off with a couple of Blue Moons while perusing the menu.  It was extensive, with almost any type of BBQ combination you can imagine.  I did not take the time to review it all, because I only had eyes for one thing.  Brisket.  To sandwich, or not to sandwich, that was the only question.  We ended up selecting two BBQ platters - one with smoked BBQ brisket and the other with smoked pulled pork.  Each came with two sides - we chose mac n cheese, pecan cole slaw and potato salad.  Hey, wait, that is only three sides.  That is because we got two, count 'em TWO orders of mac & cheese.  Enable my bad habits!  Look!  Corn bread!  Warm, moist and topped with a healthy ball of butter.  It was probably a good thing we were only given two pieces.  I could have eaten a LOT of that...  Our meals arrived quickly, along with a carafe of spicy BBQ sauce (that went very well on the mac n cheese, I might add).  While the portion sizes weren't huge, they were still impressive.  It was immediately obvious that my friend liked my brisket better than the pulled pork.  How did I know this?  1) because it was OhSoVery good and 2) It was quickly disappearing from my plate without any effort from me!  Of the sides, of course I liked the mac n cheese the most - while it was not the oh so decadent Fleming's version, or the gooey cheesy version from Scottsdale BBQ, it still hit the spot.    * We did make one strategic error.  While writing this review I noticed the Yelp Review Discount offer of 10% off the bill.  Too late to help us - but not too late to help you!  Go, eat, and ask for your discount!

Dick's Hideaway is the smaller and cooler version of Richardson's.  This place will forever have a spot in my heart because they serve brunch until 4pm every day.  Yes, you read this correctly, Every Day.    When I lived in AZ, I stopped in a few times for drinks, but it took moving away and coming back to visit to finally come to my senses and order food.  Duh.  Happily settled in with my mimosa (scandalously on a Monday!) my friend and I enjoyed:  Carne Adovada Benedict  with hash browns - I cannot say enough good things about this.  The generous portion of delicious pork topped with two perfectly poached eggs completely hid the English muffins beneath.  I ordered this without the beans that usually accompany it, and there was still more food than I could possibly finish.  Carne Adovada & Eggs - more glorious pork, served with eggs (any style) and beans.  Roasted Garlic Plate - not quite sure what we were thinking when we added this to our (already large) order.  I was happy we did, though.  An enormous head of roasted garlic served with toasted bread, roasted chilies and cheese.  I was absolutely safe from vampires for the rest of the day.    Our bartender/waiter was fantastic.  Handing me another mimosa before I can even think of asking for it will make me love you forever.  For-Ev-Er!  A word of advice.  Don't touch the plates.  No matter how badly you may want to. They are HOT.  Trust me on this one, OK?

"I will remember these shrimp for the rest of my life."  This is what my mom said after tasting the bacon-wrapped shrimp at Wildfish.  I knew I had to come back for a full meal after swooning over the amazing appetizers at the Yelp Elite event.  So, when my mom came out to visit I had the perfect opportunity to prove that great seafood can be found in the desert.  Wildfish did not disappoint.  After consulting with our (super awesome) waiter Christian, we started off with two appetizers - the crabcake and the bacon-wrapped shrimp with goat cheese.  Both were just as fantastic as I remembered.  The crabcake is large and perfect for sharing and is served with a light remoulade sauce.  The shrimp come three to a plate, complimented with a small stack of light onion rings.  My mom really knows that I love her, as I declined her (feeble and halfhearted) offers to split the third shrimp with me!  The parade of deliciousness continued with the entrees - Roasted Sea Bass and Snapper Filet with Johah Crab.  Both were served with delicate sauces that enhanced, not overpowered, the flavor of the fish.  We shared a side of steamed asparagus with hollandaise.  All sides are served family-style and the portions are large but can be ordered in half sizes that are perfect for two.  5 star staff, 5 star food.  Overall it was a great experience in every way.

Once you figure out how this place works, it is a great place for a casual and tasty breakfast.  When you arrive, it is important to get a number for an open table before you order.  Also, the menu is fairly long, so it is best to get a paper copy and figure out what you want before getting in line.  I say this because even though the line may appear long, it moves FAST.  Yes, these people at Kashman's are quick and efficient, so you don't want to reach the counter undecided!  So far I have tried various omlettes (with bagel & fruit as the side items) and a breakfast bagelwich.  All have been great and arrive at the table quickly.  An added plus is the fresh-squeezed orange juice.  The seating inside can be tight, especially if there are peole waiting in line to order, but there is ample seating outside, most of which is either in the shade or under umbrellas.  One thing I really enjoy is that it is a dog-friendly place - they have bowls of ice water and bags of biscuits outside for our furry friends to enjoy.

While the seats aren't as comfortable as my couch at home, and I can't pause the movie to grab a snack or visit the loo, I really like this AMC.    - It is clean - no sticky floors or icky seats here!  - The seating is stadium style, so you can enjoy an unobstructed view of the screen.  - The seats are comfortable, and have wide armrests so you don't have to battle for space with the person next to you.    - Plenty of screening rooms for a wide selection of movies and show times  - $5 tickets before noon on weekends, and $5 before 5pm Monday through  Thursday is a great deal!  Just like any movie theater, the negative to the experience is the occasional rude person who just cannot survive without talking/texting during the movie.  Too bad there isn't a way to eject them from their seats, like in the cartoon shown during the previews...   :)

Had a great dinner at the White Chocolate Grill on Friday.  The atmosphere was nice - high-backed booths and relaxing lighting.  Our server was attentive and took very good care of us - always a plus.  The filet with bleu cheese was fantastic, and the white chocolate brownie was the perfect ending to the meal.  That with a couple of glasses of wine left me a happy girl!

After my initial visit long ago, I re-discovered WCG with my Partner in Culinary Crime this summer.  Since then, I think we have tried a little bit of everything - lunch, happy hour, dinner, the Date Night Menu and on one occasion just dessert.  Yes, it is that good.  I update my review specifically to share three outstanding items on their menu that I would be happy to enjoy again and again:  Filet Mignon Cobb Salad - large enough for sharing, it is a very pretty presentation with orderly rows of marinanted filet, mushrooms, blue cheese, crutons, bacon, tomato, avocodo and egg all atop field greens in a red zinfandel vinaigrette.  I prefer it without the egg or avocado, but hey, I'm picky!  Silky Chocolate Soufflé Cake - A warm chocolate soufflé cake topped with with créme Anglaise and whipped cream.  Decadent and delicious - I doubt I could ever get tired of this.  Life is short, eat dessert first!  and my new favorite:  Maytag Burger - WCG grinds all their meat in-house, and this juicy delight is just right!  Each bite is infused with Iowa blue cheese and applewood smoked bacon, and these flavors enhance rather than overpower the beef.  Mmmm... Beef!  WCG now accepts reservations (recommended, it can get crowded) -  which are easily accessible from Yelp!  Reserve, go, eat and be merry!!

Aaaaahhh, Spring Training in Arizona.  The perfect opportunity to spend a sunny afternoon outside, enjoying America's Pastime.  I really like the Peoria Sports Complex, and not just because it is the home away from home for one of my favorite teams, the San Diego Padres.  The facility is great for seeing a game - I don't think you can find a seat with a bad view of the action.  Lawn tix are only $6, and if you become overwhelmed by the influx of families/small children you are free to roam around the entire stadium (and maybe score yourself a better seat!).  Concessions are abundant and ladies, the restrooms are clean!  Yeah!  What was especially cool for me on this particular Sunday was seeing Tony Gwynn, Jr. play - a solid Padre, just like his dad!  I saw TG Sr. play many times at the Q/Jack Murphy Stadium - I was even there to see his number retired at Petco Park...  I had a great time soaking up some sun, enjoying a few cool Sierra Nevadas with my friend, AND the Padres won!  Words of wisdom from a roaming vendor: "It's warm and sunny, it's not raining, enjoy a beer at Spring Training!"

Don't let the "I used to be some sort of restaurant with a drive-through" appearance fool you - Dozo is a GREAT spot for Japanese food.  A place where the food is tasty, the staff is friendly and it is not over-styled and trying to be a nightclub.  The word dozo can be translated as "please", as in "be my guest".  My friend and I have certainly been made to feel very welcome on (multiple!) visits.    Sushi?  Oh yes!  Consistently fresh and nicely presented.  Try the yellowtail sashimi, albacore tataki or maybe a Dynamite roll stuffed with slightly spicy scallops.  Your taste buds will thank you.    Not a fan of fish in the raw?  No problem!  Dozo has an extensive selection of cooked items, including a to-die-for hamachi kama (yellowtail collar) served with a light, citrusy ponzu.  Wait, forget that part.  Don't order that or there won't be enough for me!  :)  If you like loud music, shot girls and lots of California rolls topped with gooey sauces, Dozo is not for you.  That is why I like it.  Itadakimasu!!

Sundays are a good day to do, well, a whole lot of nothing.  After a successful day of avoiding anything useful or constructive, a friend and I decided to stop by for some Irish-style refreshments.    Located in what seems to be the World's Largest Strip Mall With Confusing Parking Lot, this is a very low-key enjoyable place.  It was not at all crowded on this particular afternoon, and as an added bonus, pints were Sunday bargain-priced at $3!  I tried my first ever Dirty Pear (Guinness on top of Ace Pear Cider) - dangerously good.  I wonder if it can be counted as a serving of fruit...  You can't have an Irish bar without fish & chips, and theirs is pretty good - a large slab of lightly-battered fish which was more than enough for sharing, served with a stack of crisp french fries.  While I prefer thick-cut steak fries, these skinny ones were consumed with no problem whatsoever!    Thank you, Skeptical Chymist, for assisting me in my quest for non-productivity.

Now that I have experienced the AMC Dine-in Theatre, movie going will never be the same!  I recently saw Gravity 3D in a Cinema Suite, and can say it will be hard to go back to a 'regular' theater:   - Cinema Suites are 21 and over - no little kids talking, crying or kicking my seat!   - Assigned seats - huge, comfortable reclining chairs even more cushy than my living room furniture.     - Full drink menu - gleefully drinking beer, I felt almost like we were breaking some sort of rule.  Perhaps it was flashbacks to sneaking drinks in to the movies long ago?  :)   - Food choices - while not the most extensive or fancy menu, it was pretty cool to have Mac n Cheese at a movie.  And it was Good!  The Bistro Mac n Cheese was a generous portion of cheesy pasta with topped with nicely seasoned chicken breast.   So large I couldn't finish it (and I certainly tried!).  Yes, it costs more than a typical movie theater, but it is so very worth it!

You just never know what gems are hidden in strip malls.  I was craving some good Italian food, and am so glad I decided to try Nick's!  Right when I walked in the door I knew I was in for a good experience - the wonderful aroma of garlic was in the air...  It is a cozy space, divided into a bar section and a slightly larger dining room section.  It was nicely decorated, and each table held a small vase with fresh baby roses - cute!  Upon being seated, a basket of assorted breads and dipping oil was brought to the table, which started everything off just right.  Tasty!  The menu is extensive - a LOT of writing on those pages - there is pretty much something for everyone, and I wanted to try it ALL.  It was hard to choose, since so many items on the menu looked great, and there was also a long list of tempting specials that evening.  I wondered how many times a night our waiter (who by the way was great) had to recite that entire list - the descriptions were pretty detailed!  I decided on the shrimp scampi and my friend had the linguine with white clam sauce.  Both were excellent.  The portions were generous but not overwhelming - more than enough to feel pleasantly full and and still leave with small to-go containers.  For dessert, we shared a chocolate-chip cannoli, which was a perfect finish to a great meal.  I can't wait to go back!  Soon!

Much has changed in the two years since my initial review.  Apparently Nick's has decided to toss customer service out the window.  I should have known it would be a problematic visit when it took nearly 15 minutes to be acknowledged to put in our order.  Well, it only got worse.  After nearly 45 minutes of waiting, we realized that our food was never, ever going to arrive.  Ever.  Time to leave, and never come back.  Ever.

Like "good things come in small packages", great sandwiches can come from small shops.  What the Vermont Sandwich Company lacks in dining area is more than made up by the size and flavor of those big beautiful sandwiches!  I met a friend for a late lunch - a nice break from the typical 'eat at my desk while doing three other things' type of days I usually have.  Since variety is the spice of life, we ordered two different sandwiches to split:   - Long Trail (delicious roast beef on sourdough with crumbled bacon, muenster cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, green pepper and a fantastic horseradish mayo)  - The Vermonter (maple glazed turkey & honey baked ham on wheat wtih sharp cheddar, lettuce, red onion, thinly sliced granny smith apples and cranberry mayo)  It was past the lunch rush, so our food was prepared pretty quickly.  When I first saw the sandwiches I thought "So how exactly am I supposed to eat these?"  They were big.  Very, very big.  With a little squishing/flattening I managed without making too huge of a messy disaster.  While I enjoyed them both, my favorite by far was the Long Trail.  VSC roasts their own beef, and it went so nicely with the horseradish mayo.  Delish!  Before we left, we were given a sample of a freshly-baked peanut butter/chocolate chip cookie.  Mmmm...  If you have the Phoenix edition of the Entertainment Book, VSC has a coupon - buy one menu item and get one free, up to $8.  That's a whole sandwich, people!  Enjoy!  :)

Costco kind of reminds me of a Las Vegas casino.  When you are in there, time ceases to exist.  You have no concept of how long you have spent meandering up and down each and every aisle, gawking at all of the amazing stuff.  When you finally leave, you stumble out into the parking lot a bit dazed.  Where else can you buy wine (woo hoo they have Conundrum!), a TV, designer denim, dog treats, gas and outdoor lighting all in one place?  Add to that the free samples and their gigantic slices of pizza and you have a recipe for time suckage the size of the Bermuda Triangle.  Yep, I love it.

This is one of the dirtiest gas stations I have ever encountered.  A little power-washing would go a long way.  Or, if that is too difficult, perhaps try simply emptying the overflowing trash cans periodically?    At any given time, a minimum of 3 of the 12 pumps are out of order.  The ones that do work are covered with scratched-in graffiti markings.  Classy.  The only redeeming quality is that the gas is usually a few cents cheaper than nearby competitors.  The only reason I keep coming back.  I guess you really do get what you pay for...

This is my favorite spot in AZ for a mani/pedi.  I walk in a chipped, uneven mess and walk out a polished princess!  First off, the nail salon is beautifully clean.  The massage chairs/foot baths are well maintained and cleaned between each client.  Implements are sanitized and wrapped as well.    Aside from the basic spa manicure and pedicure (which includes a hot stone massage - yeah!) There are quite a few 'add on' services available (paraffin wrap, callous removal, etc.)  However, they are never pushy to upsell, which I like.  The prices are very reasonable, especially for the level of service ($38 for manicure/pedicure, without extras).  Oh, and they have coupons as well, so my last mani/pedi was $4 off!  I guess the most complicated part is choosing a color - they have enormous selection of OPI products to choose from.  On my last visit, I enjoyed watching a really cute, much older couple.  The husband waited patiently in the front reading his Kindle while his wife had her nails done.  When she was finished, he (slowly) walked over to keep her company at the drying station, complimenting her pretty hands.  It made me smile.  :)  One item to note - while you can pay for services with a credit card, tips are cash only.

I am a pretty handy person with do it yourself tasks, but when it comes to pool care, I am a fish out of water.  For the the 5+ years l lived in Arizona, Desert Sparkle kept my pool in perfect condition.  I supplied chlorine tablets, and they handled everything else.  Thanks to Steve, who provided the weekly service, the only thing I had to consider when it came to my pool was which bathing suit to wear.  He kept me aware of any issues with the equipment, and even made friends with my dog.  :)  In addition to the weekly pool service, Desert Sparkle handled the annual maintenance of my DE filter as well as any other repairs that came up.  When my pool vacuum started to have issues, they provided me with a loaner unit until I could get a replacement.  Pool vacuums aren't inexpensive, and they provided recommendations on which units were the best in terms of performance and value, which I appreciated.  When I moved out of state and my house was on the market for sale, I knew I did not have to worry about my pool continuing to look perfect.  Since my home was vacant, Steve even put a wire tie on my back gate latch to discourage anyone from paying an unwelcome visit to my back yard.  Nice to know someone was looking out for me!  Overall I was very impressed with the service provided by Desert Sparkle.  If you are looking for honest, reliable pool care, give them a call!

I have been hooked on Chick Fil A ever since I had my first taste of a chicken nugget sample at a long forgotten mall food court.  So, when I moved to AZ I was concerned that I would not be able to get my fix - what if there were no locations nearby?  Lucky me, this location in the Scottsdale 101 center can take care of my chicken sandwich and waffle fry cravings.  Well, except for Sundays, when all CFA locations are closed.  This location is nice and clean, and service is efficient both in the restaurant and at the drive through - my orders have always been correct which is nice.  They aren't stingy with the condiments, either.  Want to try more than one type of sauce?  No problem!  Not like some other fast food places I won't name where customers are asked exactly how many catchup packets are needed.  Seriously?   I usually stick with the basic Chick Fil A Chicken Sandwich and waffle fries.  If I am feeling a little wild & crazy I will ask for lettuce & provolone cheese as well (tasty!).  If I want to pretend I am being healthy, I will get the Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich, which is not breaded and is served on a wheat bun with lettuce & tomato.  Either option is tender and juicy.  I have tried a couple of the breakfast items as well - the chicken minis (little chicken nuggets served in a slightly sweet mini bun) and the chicken biscuit sandwich are both good, as are the hash browns (quarter-sized tater tots - yum!)

I ventured away from my regular Home Depot location to visit this one for only one reason - to purchase lighting fixtures that were 'supposed' to be at this location, as indicated by the online stock check feature.    While the greeter at the door was friendly, that is where the customer service ended, and abruptly.  When I couldn't find the fixtures in the lighting section, the person I eventually found to assist me would not look up the stock number I had to see if/where they were available (other Home Depot locations do this without a problem).  Instead, I was advised to 'just order them online'.  Really?  Gee, thanks!  I would NEVER have come up with that idea on my own.    I will stick to my tried and true location, where the employees are actually helpful.

After very careful and considerate scientific study, it has been determined that Freddy's frozen custard is well, fantastic!  Yes, we think of reasons to visit the West Side just to have custard, and have been there quite a few times since first discovering it back in late November.  One scoop of vanilla and one of chocolate (side by side, please) - $2.50 - that is all it takes to make me happy.   So what is better than just the custard?  When you have it with french fries!  That is a whole different level of artery-hardening goodness.  On our most recent visit, we mentioned to the man behind the counter (who turned out to be a manager of multiple locations) that we intend to eventually try a Steakburger, but since we always show up after a sizable lunch or dinner it just hasn't happened yet.  As we were enjoying our custard and looking at the photos that line the walls of the restaurant, he came up and handed us a Steakburger with cheese (neatly cut in half) to try!  He said he didn't want us to wait another day to try a burger.  Yes, we were stuffed with sushi and custard and yes we ate it anyway.  It was tasty - thank you!  :)  Established in 2002 by the sons of WWII veteran Freddy Simon and headquartered in Kansas, Freddy's currently only has three locations in AZ (with two more coming soon).  Anyone want to go in on the $25k franchise fee?  Then we can have custard anytime!  :)

Have you ever experienced a visit to a restaurant that you wouldn't change in any way?    Everything about Donovan's was outstanding - from the time we arrived to the time we left, it was nonstop wonderful food, ambiance and service.    We enjoyed:  Crab cake appetizer:  It was more like a crab continent - this thing was big!   Big and full of crab meat goodness, without any filler.  Crab, crab  and more crab.    Spinach salad:  Light blend of spinach, mushrooms, bacon and a tangy dressing - a great transition into the main course  Filet with shrimp scampi:  My filet was prepared a perfect medium rare, and the shrimp were graced with a light garlic sauce that still allowed the shrimp flavor to shine through.  Entrees come with vegetables (snap peas and carrots - crunchy and flavorful) as well as a choice of potato.  We both chose baked potatoes, which were garnished with all the fixin's tableside.  Yum!  Wine and water glasses never went empty - every need seemed to be anticipated before we could even ask.  The team made us feel both appreciated and pampered.  I wish more restaurants had this type of attention to detail.  My only regret is we did not save valuable stomach real estate for dessert.  Guess a return visit has to happen soon!

I really like Southwest Airlines.  While not fancy, they do exactly what they are supposed to do -  get you where you are going safely and efficiently - with your luggage!  - Great customer service as well as friendly staff and crew  - Inexpensive flights with frequent time slots to choose from, as well as super easy online check-in  - No charge for two - count 'em TWO checked bags.  Yep, I can shop as much as I want at my destination and still drag it all home  - OK, parents will not like me for this one - families with children are not given priority boarding before everyone, but are slotted between the A and B boarding groups.  There are still plenty of seats to be had for you large family types, but those of us without children are not penalized.   - Wise-cracking flight attendants.  My favorite was on a flight to Vegas.  When it was time to collect the service items prior to landing the attendant on the speaker said "OK people, pass all your cups and glasses to the aisle - we are not going to fly around all day so you can drink"  Hahaha!

I like Philosophy products.  A lot.  While they are widely available at department stores and places like Sephora and Ulta, did you know there are only TWO stand alone Philosophy stores in the entire state of Arizona?  Neither did I, until a recent fantastic Groupon offer enticed me to search for one.  They are both absolutely nowhere near me - one in Mesa, and the other in Chandler.    Well, $50 worth of product for $25 was too good of a deal to pass up, so my friend and I elected to take a trip down the 101 and check out the Chandler location as well as some other stores in Casa Paloma.  The Casa Paloma store is nicely sized, with pretty much the entire selection of Philosophy offerings available to play with.  I love skin products and would probably have tried each and every one of them except I didn't want to end up smelling like a combination of flowers, rasberry and whatever else all at once.  The staff here is informative, but not pushy, which I like.  Trust me, if you let me browse in peace, I will buy...    While I may not always go all the way to Chandler to get my Philosophy fix, I now know where to go for the more difficult to find or recently released items that aren't readily available elsewhere.

Tried to eat here on Saturday night.  I say "tried" because we never ended up seeing our server.  We were seated promptly in a section with only two tables full.  The thing is, our server never came.  Never.  No "hello", no "I'll be with you in a moment", nothing.  Very strange, since the place was NOT busy.  A confused busboy walked by, and another waiter walked by, but nobody every came to our table.  WTF!?  We left after 10 minutes.  So, definitely give McGrath's a try if you want to be ignored.

One of these days I will learn NOT to take out of town guests to places I haven't tried first.    I was pretty excited for one of my favorite people to come and visit.  Her only request?  Sushi!  While I have my list of absolute AZ favorites (Tokyo Lobby, Toyama, Sakana, Hiro, Dozo) foolishly I decided we should try somewhere new.  Having read many good things about Hana, the choice was made.  Walking into the BYOB place with our Kirin Ichiban in hand, we were ready for a great evening.  Too bad that isn't what we experienced.  After being ignored for a few minutes by everyone who passed by and even the person behind the counter, I found someone to tell that there were two of us and we would like to sit at the sushi bar.  Although there were spots open, we were left standing there for quite a while.  Do you want to stand around holding a 6-pack and not even be offered a bottle opener?  Me neither.  Once we were finally seated, we weren't told about any specials, offered water or even glasses for our beer.    Deciding to make the best of it, we ordered: Yellowtail sashimi (good, the best item we had) Spicy scallop nigiri (good) Albacore sashimi (dry, not sliced through, leaving us top pick off overcooked bits and pieces) Freshwater eel nigiri (dry and crumbly rice, falling apart at the touch) Scallop dynamite ($15+ for 'krab'?  Really?)  The female sushi chef was nice but our waitress was nonexistent.  Other tables and customers at the sushi bar seemed to be getting decent service (water, getting their beer/wine/whatever from the refrigerator) but we were left without water refills (once we finally got any at all) and don't even think about getting another of those BYOB beers we brought.  It even took a while to get the unused bottles back when we were trying to leave.   Lackluster food and nonexistent service at a premium price.  No thanks.

I am always on the lookout for new-to-me places to try pizza, on the hunt for that elusive perfect crust/sauce/topping combo. Tucked away in a strip mall and not clearly visible from the street, Redendo's probably has the best you have never tasted (but should!).   On our initial visit we went with a pie that had mushrooms, 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 sausage. It was good... very good! Doughy yet crisp crust, with ample topping coverage and a flavorful sauce. Even Mr. "I Grew Up In NY" approved, which is high praise. We also tried the linguine with clams - tasty and a generous portion. However, the pizza was clearly the highlight.   You know a restaurant has earned a spot in the rotation when halfway through the meal the discussion involves what will be ordered on the next visit. We already knew what we wanted... the Popeye - a pizza highly recommended by fellow Yelper Aileen B...   We ventured back a week later and started with the pepperoni pinwheel appetizer - a small stromboli-like roll of cheese and pepperoni, encased in the fantastic crust. A nice start to the meal, especially when paired with ranch dressing (I know, weird but good - try it!).   On to the main attraction... the Popeye!  A wonderful pizza with the same fantastic crust we enjoyed previously now topped with spinach, goat cheese, ricotta and thin, slightly crisp slices of roasted garlic. Delicious! It is now the standard by which every other white pizza is measured.    While Redendo's is clearly a favorite, I do have to point out a couple of small details that for me are a bit annoying - they charge the price of two full toppings if you go half and half on a pizza. I never understand this - it is not a full serving of topping for half a pizza, why charge full price? Also, while it was recommended to try ranch dressing with the pinwheel (yum!) it was not discolsed that there is a charge for it.  These small things definitely will not keep me away - the food is great and the service friendly. A perfect combo!   Listen to Popeye and eat your spinach... on a pizza!

Eddie V's recently began offering 'All Night Happy Hour'.  This is a beautiful thing for someone like me who typically doesn't leave the office in time to get anywhere before most HHs end.  Hey, the desk-bound want happy discounted stuff too!!  I started the week off right on Monday by meeting a friend at the end of the day for HH.  Great decision!  The bar/lounge area is nicely appointed and even had live music from a jazz trio.  Over glasses of Pinot Noir we enjoyed items from both the HH and regular menus:  Wedge salad - a nice portion of cool lettuce, topped with decadent bleu cheese crumbles and heirloom tomatoes.  Our waiter even split it for us, just to keep things fair.  Crab cake - this is fantastic.  It is easily the circumference of a softball and bursting with crab.  Just crab - no chintzy filler to affect the flavor or texture.  Priced nicely for HH and delightful when paired with the remoulade sauce.  I save the best for last...  Truffled mac n cheese.  Let me say this one more time - Truffled Mac N Cheese.  Best. Thing. Ever.  This is really beyond description, but I will try.  A perfectly-executed combination of pasta, zesty cheeses, truffle oil and truffles too!  Don't forget the all-important 'crust' of cheese on top.  AAAAAAAGH!  Under my facade as a Responsible Grownup, there lies a 5-year-old who counts mac n cheese as one of my favorite things.  If this is the last one I ever taste, I will be happy.  OK, I will admit it.  We went back on Friday, too...   Primarily for the mac n cheese.  Really.

** If you are a parent that thinks it is acceptable to allow your child to run amuck, please stop reading now **  I really like sushi.  I love sitting at the sushi bar, enjoying some good food and conversation.  So, when my friend suggested that we go to Pure I was looking forward to trying this new-to-me sushi spot.  What can go wrong?  A lot.  Upon arrival we were seated at the sushi bar, and immediately noticed that a boy around the age of 10 was seated alone next to us.  I wondered where his parents were (this was at night, and I thought it was strange to leave a child alone where liquor was being served), but really didn't think it would be an issue.  Mistake.  It quickly became obvious that he could not be unsupervised.  Disruptive.  Food everywhere.  Impossible to ignore.  I am not exaggerating.  Ick.  This is not McDonalds - where are his parents!?  My friend mentions this to our waitress not once, but twice.  This is when I expect one of two things to occur:   1) we would be offered different seating, or 2) a manager would ask the parents (who I realized were dining separately at the complete other end of the sushi bar - WTF?) to bring him to sit with them so as not to disturb others.  Neither of these things happened.   In the meantime, we have a pear martini (excellent), yellowtail sashimi (OK, not great) and attempted to enjoy a crabcake (blegh).  It was not fresh at all.  It tasted metallic.  Inedible.  I know what crab should taste like, and this isn't it.    Back to our young diner - my friend, realizing that this kid is a nightmare, approaches the parents to explain the situation.  Why did he have to do this?  Because nobody on the Pure staff would step up to deal with it.  At this point I am very irritated (and hungry!).  Oh, it gets better.  My exasperation is interpreted by my friend as annoyance or maybe embarrassment that he spoke with the kid's parents.  No, no, no.  I cannot explain this for some reason and now everyone is aggravated.  Oh joy.  The waitress chooses this moment to offer to bring us something else to replace the crabcake, but I was pretty much over the whole experience at that point.  Scary kid, creepy food, my friend is annoyed with me and I really just want to leave.  I cannot get my credit card out quickly enough.  Get me out of here - that year-old hot pocket that is lingering somewhere in the back of my freezer is sounding pretty good right now.  Our waitress was extremely apologetic, and didn't charge me which I thought was nice (thus additional star).  However, some things you can't make up for.  Pure, you left a bad taste in my mouth.

I have used the Parking Spot at a few different airports, and will admit that my initial decision was based entirely on the cute yellow & black polka-dotted buses.  That was quite a few trips ago, and those dotty buses still have me hooked.  The Parking Spot in Phoenix is the best I have experienced.  Very convenient and I have always been able to find a coupon either online or in one of those mail packets that discount the already reasonable $10/day for covered parking.  ARRIVAL: After taking a ticket at the kiosk, signs indicate the row of spaces to use on that particular day.  Each time a shuttle bus has pulled up right behind me as I am parking, and I am given a card with my space number so it will be easy to locate my vehicle upon returning.  While this may not be unusual, I am used to the large parking lots at LAX where you park waaaayyy out in BFE and then hoof it to a central pickup point.  So, I feel like I am getting super special service (even if I am not - don't tell me!)  DEPARTURE: The easy to see dotty buses circle the airport frequently so I have never needed to wait very long for a ride back to the lot.  Armed with the space number card I received on arrival, the driver deposits me right at my car (again, I am not used to this!).  Check-out is very fast and the complimentary cool water is always greatly appreciated.  Save me a spot on the dotty bus - I will be back!

Pizza * Wine  I drive by Sauce nearly every day and those two words on the side of the building just kept calling to me.  Pizza * Wine  Come in!  Today!  Really!  I finally listened.  After a long day I was ready for something tasty and convenient that (most importantly) I didn't need to cook myself.  Sauce definitely fit the bill.  It is a casual yet kind of industrial/trendy place.  It is also FAST!  In no time at all I had walked up to the counter, ordered my meal, and was enjoying my juice glass (!) of pinot grigio.  I went with the most basic of pizzas - mozzarella & fontina cheese with basil.  While it was not what I typically think of as "pizza" - the crust was super-thin and kind of crispy, especially at the edges - it was tasty!  The cheese and sauce complimented the crisp crust nicely.  Yes, I ate The Whole Thing.  No to-go box here!  I justify this by telling myself that crust that thin wouldn't reheat well...  Yeah, right...  Overall Sauce is a good spot for a quick, casual meal.  I would have liked a slightly larger juice glass for my wine, though...

I can't think of enough good things to say about my visit to Spa Aviana, so I will simply go with Best Spa Visit Of My Entire Life.    This is a truly beautiful facility with outstanding staff.  From the moment I checked in to the moment I left, I felt welcome and pampered.    My massage was fantastic (thank you Michelle!).  In addition to my choice of scented oils, I was able to choose from a background music menu as well, to create a  personalized experience.  It really could not have been better - exactly what I wanted.  Afterward, I took some time to enjoy the amenities, including the whirlpool, steam room and gorgeous heated mineral pool.  The relaxation room was the perfect place to curl up with one of the soft-as-a-teddy-bear blankets and relax with a glass of wine and a nice fruit & cheese plate.  The pricing is in line with other resort spas, but this is one instance where I can say you really do get what you pay for.  If you are looking for somewhere to treat yourself, this is definitely the place!

"OK, that kicked ass!"  This is the only sentence I could manage after leaving Los Reyes de la Torta.  The food coma was quickly rendering me incoherent...  This place well, does kick ass.  ¡Muy auténtico!  Salsa music in the background and soccer on the TVs.  An extensive menu with portions that seem to only come in one size - ginormous.    We thought we were being so smart by sharing two items.  Yeah, right.  There was enough deliciousness to feed a small family.  Mango juice... served in a chalice with a big slice o' mango riding on the side.  Shrimp quesadilla... I had no idea that tortillas could be made in that size.  Torta Del Rey... Easily more than 5" tall and packed with just about everyting that their kitchen can prepare.  I would love to see someone try to bite into this.  We had to eat it with a fork.  Amusing that the torta is served with potato chips - who has the stomach real estate left to eat those!?  The only thing you can do after a meal like that is crash on the nearest couch until you feel human again.  I will be hungry again sometime late next week.  ¡Ay, lo me Encanta!

I admit I was hesitant to try La Piazza al Forno, since typically I try to avoid restaurants 'as seen on the Food Network'.  Well, in this case, a couple of visits for Saturday lunches proved that I was wrong - this is a small restaurant that creates big, wonderful flavor!    Over the course of two visits, we tried:  Pizze Bianca ($12) - certified Neapolitan pizza - oh yes!  The thin yet chewy crust was graced with homemade mozzarella, extra virgin olive oil, ricotta cheese, basil and plenty of fresh garlic.    Four Cheese Ravioli ($9) - this is a simple yet completely fantastic dish - three cheese ravioli is baked, topped with a red cream sauce and mozzarella.  You will definitely want to use some bread to enjoy all of the remaining sauce from this dish!  Panino ($7 + $1 additional for a slice of Proscuitto) - basically pizza crust-like bread with mozzarella, tomatoes and the additional proscuitto inside, served cold.  I was hoping for something more along the lines of the Schiacciata Romagnola served at Cibo.  While this was good, I wouldn't order it again.    Zeppolis ($4) - a very large portion of hot, puffy 'donut holes' sprinkled with powdered sugar.    No, there weren't any leftovers.  ;)

During a recent visit back to AZ, I had the pleasure of dining at Roka Akor with a friend who is well acquainted with the menu.  I was looking forward to trying 'a little bit of everything', and I think we first impressed, then frightened our server with the sheer volume of what we ordered.  :)  We enjoyed an outstanding selection of sashimi and rolls from Yama-San.  All I can say is he is a Rockstar.  Discovering I love yellowtail, he served us five (yes FIVE) different varieties.  I have never, ever liked uni, and he convinced me to give his a try.  Guess what?  I am a fan!  The best I have ever tasted, and from a landlocked state - crazy, I know.  We also had a variety of masterpieces from the grill, which were all outstanding.  One of the great things about how these dishes are prepared is they are all perfect for sharing.  Prime Rib Eye with Wafu Dressing Niman Ranch Pork Belly with Marinated Golden Beets Broccolini with Ginger & Sesame Crispy Brussels Sprouts with Japanese Mustard & Bonito  The cocktails were also impressive - my Manhattan(s) were perfect.  Throughout the evening my only disappointment was that it took until I moved away to finally visit.  I missed 5 years worth of dining opportunities when I lived nearby.  What, WHAT was I thinking?  One important question - do they only hire good looking chefs and wait staff here?  Go see for yourself!  ;)

As an Irish lass, how can I not like this bar?  This is the type of place where everyone can feel welcome.  In the same night, I saw the young, not-so-young, singles, couples and even two adorable grandmas who came in for drinks after evening Mass!  These feisty ladies proudly told me they show up there on St. Patrick's day at 6am.  That is dedication.  Erin go bragh!!  Warning:  $2 Blue Moon on tap in the hands of the unsupervised can cause you to become BFFs with everyone around you, offer dating advice to strangers and completely lose track of time.  Just so you know.  :)  Time flies when you are having fun...

Best. Gyro. Ever.   Yes, they have plenty of other items on the menu, but for me, their Gyro is the gold standard by which all others are measured.   A typical visit to Z's with my FFY* consists of reviewing the menu, considering new things and then deciding to get what we always order. If it isn't broken, don't fix it!  My personal favorites are:   Gyro - Z's is generously filled to nearly bursting with juicy and flavorful Grecian Delight. No Kronos here, like so many others serve. I like mine without the tomato and onion, so I can enjoy the cool lettuce and perfect amount of tatziki, embraced by a soft, warm, pillowy pita. I have yet to finish one, but have certainly enjoyed trying!   Falafel appetizer - crisp on the outside and tender inside, these falafel are complimented by a side of hummus and warm pita.   If you are really in the mood for a decadent and potentially heart-stopping treat, try the Z's Crazy Fries. These fries, topped with cheddar and Feta cheese, are fantastic when dipped in tatziki!   While this family-run restaurant is not going to blow you away with its beauty or ambiance, you will keep coming back for the food and the friendly staff.   Now if I can only convince them to move a bit closer to where I live...   * FFY - Favorite Former Yelper

The half marathon in 2012 was my first ever, and I enjoyed it so much I returned in 2013.  While the course is not the most scenic (basically running through Tempe and Scottsdale), the enthusiasm from the bands, DJs and volunteers make the route fun.    Along the mostly flat route, there are plenty of aid stations where you can get water, Gatorade and a bit of cheerful encouragement as well - thank you volunteers!  My favorite part of the race is the P.F. Chang's section around mile 10-11 which includes taiko drum players and funny/motivational signs posted along the road and held by volunteers including "3.1 miles to go -  you got this!" and "Chuck Norris never ran a half marathon".  My personal favorite was "run complete stranger, RUN!"  A huge improvement this year was repositioning the starting line - a year ago the start times were significantly delayed due to trains!  The on-time start this year was greatly appreciated.  Overall, the event is well-organized - from the check-in at the Expo to crossing the finish line.   Looking forward to doing it again next year!

I am not happy with the co worker who introduced me to Forefathers.  Do I really need another way to feed my addiction to cheesy, beefy goodness?    Of course I do!  This small restaurant in a Tempe strip mall has earned a special place in my heart.  No, not just because of the artery-strengthening cheese.  It is home to the best cheesesteak I have experienced since moving to AZ.  While the menu offers a variety of choices other than cheesesteak sandwiches (chicken and even *gasp!* salads), I stick with what I know and love:  Regular with Cheez Wiz ($7.35) - bring your appetite, because this sandwich is big!  A generous portion of thinly sliced meat and that oh so important Cheez Wiz is nestled within a soft bun.  It is gooey, drippy and messy.  Perfect.  If Wiz is not for you, it is also offered with white American cheese, Provolone or Mozzarella.  While I prefer mine with just the basic meat and cheese, you healthy types can also get any combination of 'OMG' - onions, mushrooms and green peppers.  Fries are a very nice compliment to the sandwich.  Let's be honest here, fries are a very nice compliment to nearly anything.  Forefathers' fries ($2.55) are hot, salty and crisp.  If you haven't gotten your fill of Wiz on your sandwich, you can turn those fries into Cheese Fries ($2.95).  Either way, be sure to grab a container of 'fry sauce' (I am guessing this is some blend of ketchup and mayo).  One taste and you will want to put this on everything.    Lucky for me and my cholesterol level, this gem is nowhere near where I live.

Scary.  Not run for your life scary, but creepy scary.  I think this is where dignity comes to die. Icky people on stripper poles.  Icky people grinding on the dance floor.  Icky people doing things that should be done In Private on/under tables near the dance floor.  Added one star because the bartender was nice and the drinks came quickly.  Otherwise, ick.

I was first attracted by the sign - a huge longhorn skull.  Sitting at the end of a complex crammed full of chain restaurants I had to get closer just to see what kind of place would have such a cool sign.  Hey, look!  It's a bar!  A bar with cow-spotted seating!  Had to go in and grab a quick drink just for that.  The staff was friendly and they have Blue Moon on tap.  I will definitely go back the next time I find myself that far West...

Friday at the Waste(d) Management Phoenix Open...  16th Hole Terrace Skybox  74 degrees and sunny  Tasty food provided by M Catering by Michael - especially liked the roast beef sandwiches  Bar stations practically every 20 feet*  Great people watching - you really never know just what you will see at these things!  That could have a lot to do with the bar stations...  * For maximum enjoyment of the event, bring a friend skilled at chatting up the female bartenders - he consistently returned with generously poured beverages...   See you next year!

I am a shoe addict.  I also appreciate a good bargain.  Whenever I am bored and have a little time on my hands, I like to take a walk through DSW.  I think it is kind of like playing "dress up".  You can try on anything and everything.  Such fun!  This location is one of the better ones I have visited.  It is well-organized, and the stock turns over regularly.  It is one of those hit or miss places - I will either leave with nothing or with an obnoxious amount of new footwear.  You just never know.  It has a fairly large clearance section as well - if you have the patience to look, bargains can often be found.  Definitely sign up for their rewards program - you will receive coupons regularly - yay!   Happy hunting!

A co-worker of mine is often nostalgic for his Chicago days, and says that Luke's is the closest thing he has found to a Chicago-style hot dog in AZ.  So, on this gorgeous sunny day (how can you miss Chicago on a day like today!?) off we went to satisfy a craving for some Chi-Town goodness.  If you can survive the parking lot rodeo that is the shopping area where Luke's is located, you are in for a treat.  Italian sandwiches, subs, burgers and of course, hot dogs.  This place is popular!  The space is small and the line to order can stretch out the door, so get there early if you want a table at lunchtime.  I went with "The Original" - a pure beef hot dog with mustard, relish, pickle, and tomato in a poppy seed bun.  It is usually served with onions and peppers as well, but I like to make fresh breath a priority and decided against those.  I don't think there was any room left in the bun, anyway.  My friend had the Maxwell Street - a Polish sausage with onions, peppers and mustard.  It looked pretty tempting, too.  Both came with a side of crinkle-cut fries, which I upgraded to cheese fries in order to get a heart-stopping vat of cheese sauce for dipping.  I am not ashamed to admit that I ended up dipping the hot dog in there too.  So bad, but so good!  I am now going to curl up under my desk and take a nap.

I was recently introduced to Scottsdale BBQ Co by fellow Yelpers who Know Their Food.  As I enjoyed my juicy burger that day, I knew two things to be true: 1) this place would make a great lunch spot for my perpetually hungry co-workers (guys like BBQ, what can I say?), and 2) I could not die happy without trying the tri tip sirloin sandwich.  So, back at the office I warned everyone to break out their "big stretchy pants" and get ready for a field trip to Fantastic BBQ Land.  We piled in on a Friday ready to EAT.  Right off, everyone appreciated the down-home, no-frills feel, complete with a loud screen door, gingham tablecloths and the specials listed out on a chalkboard.  After chatting with the owner (who is super cool, by the way) we all ended up with either tri-tip sirloin or pulled pork sandwiches, all with the most amazing spicy BBQ sauce you will ever taste.  I had the sirloin tri-tip I had been thinking about since my last visit.  So worth waiting for!  Huge - I couldn't finish it (and I really, really tried).  My side, of course, was mac n cheese which I promptly decorated with Tabasco.  Mac n cheese o' fire!  Others had baked beans, potato salad, mac n cheese sans tabasco (silly boys, afraid of the burn...), and caesar salad.  The caesar looked especially good, with nice slivers of parmesan gracing the top.  I stole a few.  Ok, more than a few...   All in all, everyone walked out happy (and ready for a nap!).  It was a messy, good, 6-napkin per person experience.

When I was invited to join friends on their visit to Queen Creek Olive Mill during the Harvest Festival, I jumped at the chance to play 'tourist' in my home state.  There are a lot of things to like here, and we saw all of them:   - Lunch in the Eatery at the Mill - while I thought the food was just OK, the cupcakes I tried later (Meyer Lemon and Vanilla Bean) were amazing!  - Olive Oil 101 class ($5 per person) - lots of good information on how olive oil is made.  I learned why I cannot stand the taste of black olives from a can, but loved the green olives at the Mill - it is all in the preparation!  - Marketplace - I cannot pass up an opportunity to shop!  The Marketplace had a nice assortment of olive oils, balsamic vinegars, olive-oil based bath & body products as well as a selection of gift items and wines.  I managed to hold back just a little, but still walked out with some great things including a super tasty Asiago Parmesan tapenade, Meyer Lemon olive oil and strawberry balsamic vinegar.  I told myself they would make great gifts, but let's face it, I will keep them all for myself.  Make an afternoon of your visit!  Enjoy the gorgeous weather while listening to the live music outside and savoring some wines from the Marketplace.  Cheers!

After a long week of being trapped in a conference room, I really really needed to be outside.  Pinnacle Peak helped to put me back in my normal happy place.  This spot is very popular and can get really crowded on weekends.  I wanted to enjoy a little bit of solitude, so I arrived as the sun was rising.  Good choice - there were only a few others around on this chilly morning.  The 3+ mile trail is an out-and-back route, with enough ups and downs to keep it interesting.  Like a stairmaster, but better because you aren't in a gym squished next to some icky sweaty person.  The well-maintained path is packed gravel, so you can spend more time enjoying the beautiful views rather focusing on where you are stepping.  For those that want to take their time and learn a little, there are small signs along the route that label various plants, as well as two rest points with markers to tell you the names of the mountains you can see in the distance.    Get up!  Go outside!  You will love it as much as I do.

Want to play outside?  REI has pretty much anything and everything you could possibly need, as well as lots of things you probably don't need but that look really cool.    I was first introduced to this location shortly after moving to AZ.  A visiting friend who loves the outdoors suggested that I get out and go hiking as a way to explore my new home state.  Off to REI we went and I ended up with a new blue Camelbak (the girl version!) as a housewarming gift.  Cool!   Well, a new Camelbak requires new shoes, right?  I returned the following week to acquire my Very First Pair of Hiking Shoes Ever.  No more cross-trainers for me - I meant business!  The woman who assisted me was extremely patient, helpful and informative.  She even had me try a few pairs on the fake rock in the shoe section to ensure a correct and comfortable fit.  I love my Merrills!  Are they pretty?  No.  Have they taken me on a lot of great hikes in the past year?  Yes!  Since then I have been back quite a few times for various items, and each time have encountered friendly staff.  Most recently I purchased a pair of Pearl Izumi spin shoes (25% off during the annual sale!  Yeah!) and even though the store was packed, I was helped quickly and the clips were installed within 5 minutes.    What else do I like?  Items ordered online can be shipped to the store free of charge.  Also, the member co-op program provides an annual dividend on purchases and % off 'members only' coupons.  Need a life vest for your dog?  They have them!  Does your cat need a tent?  They have those too!  Oh wait, those are just little display models...

I am having a good hair day.  Why?  Yesterday I went to the Kohler Academy!  It was my 3rd visit, and each time I have walked away happy.  At first, I was hesitant to visit a beauty school - I had never been to one before and remember the things I used to do to my Barbie Styling Head.  Not good.  However, I decided to give it a try and I am glad I did.  The location is set up like a real salon, with kind of an industrial edge.  They use Bumble & Bumble hair products (great!) and the students on the "floor" are all pretty far along in the program (each must complete 1,600 hours of coursework in order graduate).  You receive a consultation, and the student stylist reviews the plan with an instructor prior to starting work.  The instructor also checks in a few times during the visit and looks over the "finished product" before you leave.  While the color/cut may not be the quickest as the students are still perfecting technique, the prices are great and everyone is very friendly.  Give it a try - you will be pleasantly surprised.

Is ice cream for lunch a bad thing?  I don't think so either, especially when it comes from Sweet Republic.  What a cool place - how have I survived all this time without coming here?  Everything is made in-house from natural ingredients - no crazy things with multiple syllables you can't pronounce.  So, I can tell myself it is actually *healthy* kind of like salad but much better tasting.   :)  The sweet woman behind the counter gave me a couple of samples, and seeing that I really liked them, kept suggesting others to try - "If you like that, you will love THIS!"  I wanted to leap over the counter and hug her, but somehow managed to restrain myself.  I settled on a scoop of vanilla bean and one of sugar n spice, and started a list in my head of the flavors I want to try next (Belgian Chocolate!  Real Mint Chip!!).  Walking out with my cup clutched in my greedy hands, I was happier than a little kid at recess.

"Do you like Middle Eastern food?"   This question started my impromptu tour of Cool Places I Didn't Know Existed in Phoenix.  Uh, wait... where are we?  A grocery store?  I like it!  Al-Hana is located within Baiz Market - if you didn't know that, you would probably never find it.  Walking inside, I was immediately taken with the scent of exotic spices, and the interesting combination of hookahs and religious artwork for sale.  I could have spent way longer lingering in the aisles - they have items that I haven't seen elsewhere, and at very reasonable prices.      The dining area is a simple order-at-the-counter setup, with a small collection of tables and chairs.  It is easy to see that everything is made fresh on-site, since the brick oven is right behind the counter and you can watch the goodness happen.    Ooohhh... the food...  babaghannuj with fresh pita, chicken shawarma, and adorable meat pies.  Oh yes!  The more I ate, the happier I was.  By the end, I was smiling and waving at the guys working the brick oven.  You are awesome!  Oh, and the whole table full of delights was only $12...    Too bad I ran out of stomach real estate (and was actually stuffed for the rest of the day) - so many other things I want to try and buy...  little pies that look like pizza... baklava (OK, actually the entire dessert case in the back of the store)... and the cheese, glorious cheese!  This makes me wonder, what other hidden gems are out there, waiting to be found?

I used to love you, Al-Hana.  I have fond memories of enjoying good food and good company while sitting at your little wobbly tables and chairs.  I fell in love with your babaghannuj.  Yes, you had a lot going for you.  I was disappointed, but kept coming back, when you decided to raise the price on Every Single Item I Like, while making all of the portions smaller.  I understood that you have to pay for those new glossy menus with the pretty pictures somehow even though I liked the old menu board with the plastic letters just fine, thanks.  I settled for slow and sometimes surly service from your staff.  Why?  Because I loved you.   Well, I think our one-sided relationship has come to an end.  That last visit - you know, the one where you gave our food to another customer (uh, you were confused?), and left us waiting for over 35 minutes without an apology while fulfilling orders for people who arrived and ordered much much later?  That will be my last one.    I especially will cherish the charming way in which the 'manager' grudgingly provided a refund for the food I never received.  "Do you want to return the water as well?"  Um, no.  Since I had to get it out of the cooler myself, I actually received that portion of what I ordered.  Thanks.  Keep your rising prices and shrinking portions.  You are no longer worth my affection.

Day not starting out the way you want?  Fortunately, there is a way to put frustration to productive use.    Gwen.  Gwen the Rockstar Spin Instructor at Lifetime Fitness.    Her classes are Intense.  Insane.  Powerful.  Motivating.  Exhausting.  Today the focus was on endurance.  Good.  Turn off the lights and let's DO this!  I just let go of everything that was bothering me, and felt as if I was all alone in the room.  There were probably 50+ other people there, but I didn't notice them.  It was just me, the bike, and Three Six Mafia - "I want to FEEEEEL IT".  Oh I felt it.    Sweaty, tired and happy.  Aaaaahhh.  All better now.  Bring it Tuesday, I'm ready for you...

This is a beautiful supermarket.  I guess I never really considered how different locations of the same chain can be like night and day.  This location is by far the nicest Fry's I have visited.  The produce section is very large and the entire store is exceptionally clean.  The deli, meat and seafood sections are also much larger than a typical Fry's.  Best of all?  The prices are exactly the same as the lackluster "regular" locations!  Same, same, same.   Ooooh I like that!

Sometimes all you need is a little help to see what has been in front of you all along.  Lorenzo's is so very close to where I live, but I was just introduced to it this weekend.  Thank You!!  :)  My friend suggested we order some fantastic take-out to enjoy while watching the playoff games.  A quick call and we were zooming down Pinnacle Peak towards some of the tastiest Italian food I have had in a while.    Two words... Garlic Knots.  Beautiful little twists of dough that have been marinated in an aromatic blend of chopped garlic and olive oil... heated and served with a tangy marinara sauce.  After getting them home they never even made it onto our plates - we attacked them right in the container!  It is too bad that my mom raised me to have good manners, since I grudgingly gave my guest the last one.  Seriously, the order could have been twice as big and we could have polished it off without a problem.  Next... Antipasto salad.  A generous serving of all kinds of good things including fresh mozzarella, salami, provolone... delish!  The Main Event... a killer ham & cheese calzone.  This thing could have doubled as the football on the TV.  Huge!  Beautiful!  Stuffed full of ham, mozzarella and ricotta.  Topped with the marinara sauce it was truly a sight to behold.  Yesssssss!  My car still smells like garlic.  I really like that!

The Container Store is one of those places I go when attempting to create order from chaos.  Each time I visit, I find at least one amazing thing that I had no idea I needed yet somehow can no longer live without.  Each time I leave with things I did not plan to buy.  Yet, I keep going back.  I guess it helps that the store is very well organized (well, duh) and the employees are friendly, helpful and make excellent product suggestions.  Oh, and the shoe boxes are amazing.  You can buy them by the case.  Don't ask how or why I know this.  During holiday season, you can find fun stocking stuffers and great things for packaging and wrapping gifts.  I love the doggie wrapping paper and hope it will be back in stock this year!  I will keep going back, pursuing that fantasy vision of that perfect organized life.  I can do it.  I just need one more apothecary jar...  Or two...

I love shoes - high heels, flip flops, and everything in between.  I can't decide if it is an addiction or an obsession.  Maybe both?  In fact, I used to have a separate room for my shoes.  No, I am not kidding.  Recently I noticed a few of my favorite pairs were looking a bit worn and in need of some TLC.  Hey, don't we all feel that way sometimes?  Fortunately, Ariel's Shoe Repair was able to give my sad shoes exactly what they needed!    Ariel's is like a spa for footwear.  On two occasions I brought in pairs that I doubted could be helped and came back to shoes that were refreshed and revitalized.  Amazing!

Nice - very nice. Beautiful decor and an atmosphere that is upscale without being stuffy. The Saturday night I was there, the dining room was full and the bar was doing a brisk business. We had a reservation, and were seated promptly (yay!). Our server was great - attentive but not overwhelming, and very knowledgeable about the menu. The wine list was extensive but not so large as to be an encyclopedia that takes forever to review. After selecting wine, we started out by splitting the house salad - divided between two people it was just enough and a good start to the meal. I had that evening's special - halibut served with mushrooms and asparagus. The fish was prepared perfectly - flaky and moist, and the vegetables and sauce went really well together. My mom had the sea bass, which she loved - ate every bite - hey, I didn't even get a taste!! We also had a side of asparagus with some of the best hollandaise sauce I have ever enjoyed. We were too full to try dessert (darn!) so I just have to go back very soon...

"You know where we are supposed to go, right?"  "No, I thought you knew."   Excerpt of conversation on the way to the Old Town Farmers Market.  Good thing that Yelp Blackberry app has a map feature!  A visit to the OTFM is a fun way to spend a Saturday morning. There is a (small but growing) diverse selection of vendors with everything from the expected produce to confections to seafood to "beer" for dogs! No need to eat beforehand, either. Almost everyone offers samples (even wine!). Kind of like a way cooler local outdoor Costco.  Where they allow dogs.  Well not exactly, but you get my point.   I sampled more types of chocolate than I can count, tasted my first-ever cheese curd, and am now a huge fan of Goody Twos toffee. Also, we couldn't let the morning go by without a scoop of Lime Basil Sorbet from the Sweet Republic bus.   Surprisingly, I managed to restrain myself from purchasing everything I saw, and walked away with only an amazing jar of Roasted Garlic Feta Cheese from Made by Bees (decadent when enjoyed on pieces of warm french baguette!), two HUGE artichokes, and a bundle of green onions.   I am looking forward to going back and getting there earlier next time - by 10am there were enough people to make it a little difficult to navigate and reach some of the more tasty treats. I will also remember to use the environmentally conscious Yelp grocery bags which were accidentally left in the car.  Oops!  They will be filled with salmon, handmade soap, more artichokes, some asparagus, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and, and, and... :)

Update!  Sometimes you do get a second chance to make a first impression.  I recently returned to Humble Pie for another try.  I am happy to say that the service was MUCH better than my previously reviewed visit (yay!).    I had the shrimp pizza, and my friend enjoyed the chicken with pesto pizza.  Both were prepared perfectly, with thin crust that tastes slightly of sourdough.  Our waiter was cheerful and attentive, and kept those water & wine glasses filled.     Since this location is so convenient for me, I am happy that I had a better experience this time.  Of course, it didn't hurt that it was a Monday, where all bottles of wine are 1/2 off - woo hoo!

This restaurant seems to have a split personality.  When they are good, they are very, very good.  Friendly service and well-prepared breakfasts (the Eggs Benedict and the Breakfast Fried Chicken were two favorites).  However, after nearly half of the times I have visited, I asked myself why I keep coming back.  Perhaps, like some sort of dysfunctional relationship, I only want to think of the 'good times' and hope that the rest gets better?    The Eggs Benedict is a hit or miss - I never know if my dish will show up with cold, rock hard yolks and practically raw hash browns.  The Breakfast Fried Chicken (served with eggs as well as a choice of toast or pancakes) is a good choice, but recently, the portion size has decreased while the price was raised (yes, we noticed the smaller plate).  Service is consistently inconsistent - it can either be attentive, or nonexistent.  Yes, the place gets busy, but that isn't an excuse for a 45+ minute wait for food (while being completely ignored, without even a water refill).  It also isn't an excuse to cram tables so close together that on one occasion we were placed directly in the path of the traffic to/from the kitchen, with trays continually being hoisted over our heads.  Being busy doesn't mean that you can set tables with filthy (dried food caked on) silverware and then be surprised when I ask for another place setting.  I think it is time to accept that our relationship just doesn't work, and move on.

There is always room for frozen yogurt.    After consuming what I think was the largest meal of my life, I was surprised to realize that yes, I still wanted a sweet treat for dessert.  Maybe it was the fact that it was pretty darn warm out (95+ in April?  Ouch!), but when my friend suggested Yogurtology, I was IN!  What a great place - even though it was pretty crowded with quite a few families with kids in tow, the store was clean, clean, clean.  There was one employee who in the 20 minutes we were there must have swept up twice and wiped down the yogurt machines 3 times.  I like that, because it is easy to let self-serve stations get sticky and messy.  While we tried quite a few flavors that were all good (rasberry, chocolate, pina colada, etc), the stand-out was definitely Peach.  Peachy Keen and SO good!  Although we were sharing the cup, I rudely scooped under the other flavors to get more of that.  Not polite, but...  Apparently it is not offered very often, so we were definitely in the right place at the right time.  Funny how that works sometimes.  Self-serve yogurt is priced by weight, including toppings and Yogurtology is not the least expensive option at $0.45/ounce.  Beware!  It was amusing to watch little kids really load up their cups with everything under the sun, and then see the look of surprise on mom/dad's face at the weigh-in.

I just may have found my new lunch spot!  When I saw they were serving $5 lunch specials during the summer, I was a bit skeptical.  Would the portions be stingy?  Would the items be sub-par copies of the full-priced counterparts?  Nope!  Today's special was the angus burger with fries.  The made-to-order burger was big and juicy, on a super soft bun and graced with swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato and remoulade.  The fries were thin and crispy, and filled over half of the plate.  $5!?  Seriously!??  To top it off, it came with a ticket for a scoop of gelato to enjoy afterward - I decided on the cheesecake - yum!  I can't wait to go back and try something else very soon!  How cool to get something inexpensive, without walking away feeling cheap...  :)

* Now that the weather has cooled here in AZ, I can look back on the Roasting HeatFest that was summer and comment on some of the more enjoyable moments... *  It is Saturday afternoon.  It is hot.  There is time before the Dbacks game.  Where should we go?  Hey, how 'bout the Turf!?  And so starts the afternoon/evening in Phoenix...  I am an Irish girl, and have a soft spot in my heart for Irish pubs.  The first time I visited the Turf (randomly in the morning after a HUGE breakfast... too early to do any real damage) I knew I wanted to come back.  First off, we were able to secure a great parking spot right around the corner and in the shade, too.  Score!  Be aware that the parking spaces are metered, so bring quarters and keep an eye on the time.  Nobody likes a parking ticket (no, I didn't get one).  The Turf has two things near and dear to my heart.  Comfortable bar stools and purse hooks.  Oh, and the fact that the staff is friendly, the prices are fair and the food is good doesn't hurt, either.  Boddington's on tap?  Why yes!  Those were paired with fish & chips with steak fries (to which the vinegar was liberally applied).  For some reason the bartender ended up with an 'extra' Hoegaarden that he gave to us as well (nice!).  Too bad the Turf Bar isn't closer to my corner of the world - I think it would be a fun place for Happy Hour.  Well, there is always next baseball season!

I am on the fence with this one.  While the atmosphere is relaxed and fun (who wouldn't like that retro gas station ambiance?) and the service was quick and friendly, the food is not enough to keep me coming back for more.  The outdoor seating is casual, with picnic benches and tables surrounding two 70's style gas pumps.  The setting offers a perfect view of the world going by on Cave Creek Road.  Dogs are welcome (yay!), and you will see plenty of furry friends enjoying the day.  The interior is small, but the space is used well with a few tables, and a small bar which also serves as the counter where orders are placed.    Looking forward to big juicy burgers, we chose: Big Earl Burger ($5.75) Bleu Burger ($6.99) Side of Onion Rings ($3.75) Vanilla Milkshake ($5.75)  The milkshake was by far the best item - thick and creamy.  However, at a price of $5.75 I was disappointed to see it came from a machine.  The burgers were OK - I enjoyed the ample bleu cheese on mine, but the beef patties were thinner than I expected.  The onion rings, while indeed greasy, were not the best I have tried.  That award hands-down goes to Rocket Burger.    On this visit, we had a 20% off coupon.  The woman who took our order seemed a bit confused by the math, and we ended up only receiving a 10% discount.  Shame on me for not catching it earlier, as the line when we left was very long and I did not want to wait to request a correction.  All in all, Big Earl's is a good place to sit outside and enjoy the view.  Maybe with a beer or two but not for the food.

For the past three years, the official kickoff of Spring Training has been a trip to Goodyear Ballpark to see the Reds/Indians.  I don't live anywhere near this stadium, or know anyone from Cincinnati or Cleveland, but traditions don't necessarily have to make sense...  The stadium is something that Goldilocks would like - not too big, not too small.  It is just right.  Plenty of seating in both sun and shade, a variety of concessions and pretty good beer prices as compared to other stadiums.  Clean restrooms, too!    There is a miniature baseball diamond with plastic balls & bats for kids (and adults who act like kids, ahem, me) to enjoy.  The ballpark even has its own mascot, Izzy, and skydivers to bring in the American and Arizona flags for opening weekend.  Pretty cool!  Sadly, this is the nicest stadium that nobody visits.  I have yet to see a crowded game.  I am guessing that if it were located anywhere but Goodyear (a bit of a drive!) it would be more popular.    Start your own Spring Training tradition and make it out to Goodyear!!

Aaaaahhhh... the feeling of driving a clean, shiny car.  I don't know why it took me so long to figure out that this hand car wash was so close to my house, especially since I have driven by more times than I can count.  I should be more observant - wonder what else I have been missing!  I have visited twice, with two different vehicles and they both came out looking great - and I am very picky!  The employees are friendly and will recommend what service you need without being pushy.  It was not crowded when I was there (both times on Friday afternoon) so the wait was not long at all.  If you do have to wait, there are a few areas for seating - indoors as well as a patio and shaded area outside where you can watch your car being dried (under a cover by the way, so no baked-on water spots!).  The best part is the air hose they use to get the water out of all the cracks and crevices - an added touch that I like.  Give Classic Car Spa a try - I am sure you won't be disappointed.  :)

After all of the recent rains, my car was looking less than wonderful.  Pretty bad, actually.  While I like/prefer to wash my own cars (I am pretty picky about these things), there hasn't been time.  Too many fun things to do on the weekends!  Car wash, here we come...  I was pleasantly surprised to find out this morning that Classic Car Spa is offering an "early bird" special - Monday through Thursday from 7:30 - 9am you will receive $5 off any wash!  As an added bonus, at 7:45 there wasn't a wait - I was in and out of there in less than 20 minutes!  A shiny clean car is a good way to start the week.

Awestruck.  That is how I felt sitting on an overhang just off of the Boulder Canyon trail, taking in the most magnificent view I have seen since moving to Arizona.  Enjoying the pleasant warmth of the sun and the light breeze, it was one of those rare moments where I wouldn't change, well, anything.  The Boulder Canyon trail was my first venture into the Superstition Mountains/Tonto National Forest.  What a great introduction!  I am happy to know that something so enjoyable is less than an hour from my front door.    First, the winding section of AZ88 to/from Canyon Lake Marina (parking for the trail) is an experience in itself.  Definitely a take the convertible, drop the top, wind in the hair type of drive.  Woo!  Twists, turns, breathtaking views of the lake and rock formations, plus a couple of one-way bridges thrown in just to keep things interesting.     The trail itself begins on the south side of AZ88, right across from the Marina, and immediately starts climbing into the hills.  Parts of the trail are a little challenging, with loose rock and a couple of fallen saguaro to maneuver around/over, and a few areas with somewhat steep incline.  Take it at your own pace, you will get there!  (hint:  if your friend is much faster than you and disappears into the distance, take solace in knowing you have the car keys... haha!)  There is a lot to see along the way - cool rocks, huge cholla and saguaro that look like something out of a Dr. Seuss illustration.  Due to the recent rain, everything was much greener than I expected too.  The reward at the peak is more than worth the effort - a panoramic view of Weaver's Needle, Battleship Mountain, La Barge Canyon/creek and the Superstition ridgeline.  Truly spectacular.  If you haven't been here, add it to your to-do list.  Now.  In a couple of weeks, there should be wildflowers...

When I was told that Cartwrights serves 'game meats', I was worried that it would be the type of place where I would need to avoid making eye contact with taxidermied animal heads mounted on the walls. To my relief, there was neither a buffalo nor elk head in sight to gaze at me accusingly. Instead, the interior reminded me of a rustic and comfortable yet upscale ranch house. I especially liked the ambiance added by the fireplaces within each room. Although they were not lit (hey, it is summer in AZ) I can imagine how welcoming they would be on a chilly evening.   Oh, the menu! It had a little bit of everything - seafood, steaks & game, poultry & pasta. It was hard to decide what to choose, since so many things looked good. I went with the salmon prepared Mediterranean style. Wise decision! It was beautiful - pan-roasted with artichokes, leeks, garlic, roasted tomato & spinach, atop pesto-tossed angel hair pasta. Almost too pretty to eat. Almost. My friend, more adventurous than I am, chose the buffalo tenderloin. Prepared medium-rare, it came with wild mushrooms and a peppercorn sauce that was beyond good. I had never tried buffalo, and was pleasantly surprised by both the texture and taste. Of course, my positive opinion could have been influenced somewhat by the mini-cauldron of mac & pepper-jack cheese...   The wine list is impressive, with a wide selection of all things good that come from grapes. I have been on an AZ wine run lately, and chose the AZ Stronghold Nachise (a blend of Syrah, Grenache and Petite Sirah). My friend went with the Rutherford Ranch cab (great with the buffalo!), and we were both happy.   What a nice way to spend an evening meal. Our server was outstanding - attentive but not overbearing and very knowledgeable too.   I already know what I want to try next - filet mignon and the S'Mores dessert are calling to me!

It's only an hour, how hard could it be?  Oh how naive I was when I walked into the Dailey Method!  This workout is different than anything I have ever done.  An intense combination of ballet barre work, stretching and resistance, it is designed to create lean, strong muscles while enhancing flexibility.  The movements are precise, targeting muscles I didn't even know I had!  It left me feeling great, even though some parts were trembling with exhaustion!  By the end, I actually felt taller.  Linda the owner was our instructor - a tiny dynamo of energy!  She and Sarah, another instructor who was taking the class, were very helpful in explaining the correct form and occasionally would adjust us into proper alignment.  Much more difficult when done correctly!  These women are so nice and very enthusiastic about the practice.  They were great motivators, too.  I wasn't the only new person today, so I wasn't the only one struggling!  Geesh - I havent done a split since cheerleading!  My fellow newbie and I have agreed to go back next Sunday - maybe I can get a couple of more inches of stretch...  I wonder if I will be as happy tomorrow, when I will certainly wake up sore!

The first time I visited Petite Maison, it was for lunch on a cold and rainy afternoon. As I rushed past the wet outdoor seating, I promised myself I would come back in better weather and enjoy an evening on the patio.   One should never break promises, especially the ones you make to yourself. So, I was more than happy to return recently for wine and appetizers under the stars! No rain here - just a beautiful night for dining alfresco. The patio, complete with lit fireplace, was like a garden party surrounded by plants and flowers. I couldn't have asked for better atmosphere.   Sitting back and sipping a nice glass of Latour Domaine de Valmoisinne Pinot Noir I thought "this is as good as it gets". What was I thinking? Of course it could get better - I hadn't even eaten yet!   We weren't "full meal" hungry, so my friend and I decided on a few appetizers to enjoy along with our wine:   Escargots en Croûte - this was my first experience with escargot, and I will admit that due to an unfortunate childhood snail incident I was a bit hesitant. My bravery was rewarded by the perfect combination of garlic, herbs, pernod and butter, all capped off by puffed pastry. Yes, I dipped my bread in the segments of the serving dish to absorb more garlicky goodness.   Moules Maison - I am a huge fan of mussels and these didn't disappoint. They were nicely sized, and served in a white wine and thyme broth. More bread-dipping ensued...   Soup à l'onion - I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE onion soup and this was among the best I have tasted. The broth was rich and flavorful, with just the right amount of caramelized onions. It was topped with bubbling gruyere cheese that made each and every bite so very good.   Our server was attentive and informative - she really knew the menu! Extra points for keeping us stocked with warm herb rolls. When asked about one of the after dinner drinks on the menu, she even produced a sample of Armagnac Samalens. While I didn't try it, my friend wanted to "bathe in it" so I am assuming it was very good!   I can't wait to go back...

I like it here!  After hearing how great this place was, I had to see for myself.  Happy Hour?  I'm in!    Upon arrival, the first thing I noticed was the open and inviting decor - bamboo floors, high ceilings, a beautiful outdoor patio... what's not to like?  Oh, and ladies, the bar had purse hooks!  While Calistro serves "healthy cuisine", please do not translate that to mean "cardboard-esque and tasteless".  Each item we tried was delicious, full of richness and flavor.  I learned that 80% of the ingredients used are organic, and most are from local vendors.  They even have organic vodka.  Did you know that organic vodka existed?  I didn't.    It was a very happy HH, indeed.  Flatbread - a wood-fired combination of tomatoes, pesto, basil and fresh mozzarella.  It was much larger than I expected, and the flatbread crust was perfect - even the cheese-less edges which I usually don't eat...  Wood Roasted Ravioli - from the Shared Plates section of the dinner menu.  I had never tried a "baked" ravioli and these, prepared in the wood-fired oven, were outstanding!  The filling was a sweet and savory combination that I really enjoyed.  Short Rib Panini Sliders - were it not for the bread (which was toasted just right), you would not need to chew.  The braised short ribs are that tender.  Beautiful!  Angeline Pinot Noir - a pleasant taste of California wine country (blend of Sonoma, Mendocino & Santa Barbara grapes).  I like Calistro's presentation - the wine is first poured into a small individual carafe and then a portion is poured into your glass - you pour the rest when you are ready.  Maybe it is for aeration, but visually this makes me think I am getting more than one glass - yum!  I did make my typical mistake of not leaving any room for dessert (when, oh when will I learn?).  The Chocolate Soufflé Cake the couple next to me had looked amazing.  Darn!

Is it?  Can it be?  A Vietnamese spot I like better than Da Vang?  Yes...  Since my Vietnamese food loving friend introduced me to Pho Thanh a few weeks ago (thank you!!), I have already enjoyed multiple visits.  It is that good.  They are open early, too (8:30am!) so it is a good choice for a post-hike late breakfast/early lunch.  A typical visit starts off with the #1 spring rolls.  They are huge - rice paper stuffed with shrimp, pork, lettuce, mint and sprouts and (yay!) served with peanut sauce.    Sometimes a Bahn Mi (sandwich) gets thrown into the mix - fresh soft bread and ample portions of warm pork.    On to the Main Event... Pho.  Their take-out menu states on the front "The Best Beef Noodle Soup In Town" - believe it.  They are not kidding.  I am a creature of habit, and always have the #113 - beef noodle soup with filet mignon tenderloin beef.  I like to have the raw beef served on the side, so I can "cook" it myself in the hot broth.  I am tempted to ask for extra beef the next time I am there.  I don't know how long I can last until I need to go back.

Cooking can be fun, especially when someone else is doing it.  It also helps to have kitchen assistants who pre-chop, organize, and clean up afterward!  This is what I have decided after attending a recent class at Sur La Table, an event to highlight a few recipes from the Junior League of Phoenix cookbook Pomegranates and Prickly Pears.  Chef Dan was awesome - he worked the kichen area with speed and skill, preparing portions of the various recipies simultaneously.  We could see everything he was doing in a large mirror and on two TV screens.  Cooking, making jokes and answering our (sometimes ridiculous) questions all at the same time.  Since this was a demonstration rather than a hands-on class, all I had to do was sit back and enjoy each item as it was completed.  While I am not sure if I would try to make any of the dishes on my own (crepes look very difficult!) I did enjoy the tips & tricks he explained, including how to slice an onion without crying.   As an added bonus, after the class he found us wandering in the store (my friend was intent on taking advantage of the 15% off coupon) and offered us a sample of a new cookie recipe he was trying out.  Why yes, I'll take two!

It started out promising enough.  We were pleasantly greeted and seated promptly.  Reviewing the menu, many of the dishes looked good.  Our waitress seemed nice (despite the really long red sparkly fingernails - maybe not appropriate for food service?) - she brought water and took our order.  Then things went sideways...  What we ordered:  Eggs Benedict with well-done hash browns, and the Arizona Burrito.    What we received:  Barely warm undercooked hash browns and poached eggs that were left sitting too long - the yolks were rock hard!  How long did those poor things sit before being served?  Ick.  The Arizona Burrito was supposed to contain eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes & cheese.  While it was large and impressive to look at on the plate, where was the meat?  A few paltry pieces could be identified amidst the egg/potato filling.  I would have liked to be able to ask to have my hash browns cooked a bit longer, or for my eggs to be cooked correctly, but our waitress DISAPPEARED.  Gone.  Where did she go?  Busy staff came and went (walking right by empty water glasses time and time again), but she was nowhere to be found.  She never came back to check on us, refill water or even give us our bill.  Another waitress passing by took pity on us, and went to find someone to bring our check.  Breakfast is supposed to be a good start to the day, not an exercise in frustration.  One more note - please remove the Christmas decor - it is the end of January.

Costco!  I can get discounted gas, a rotisserie chicken, huge bricks of cheese and mountains of paper towels all in one place.  Not to mention meat, and dog treats, and, and, and...  I recently visited this location after work, and was not entirely paying attention to what I was doing.  As I got up to the checkout line, I realized that I had put unsalted butter into my cart rather than the regular variety.  I was ready to head back to the far end of the store to return it (I think it is rude to leave things you don't want at the check stand and make it somebody else's problem) when the nice girl who was assisting the cashier offered to take it back to the refrigerator section for me.  Cool, thanks!  What was even better?  When she ran back up to the check stand with two kinds of salted butter (regular and organic) just in case I still wanted to make that purchase.    She turned my mistake into a perfect example of good customer service.  :)

At the end of an action-packed Saturday including a hair-raising drive and strenuous hike, it was time to simply sit back and R-E-L-A-X.  My friend and I declared that Pain Killers on Hula's outdoor deck were just what the doctor ordered.  There is something very right about the combination of rum, coco lopez, pinapple and orange juice.  Since Hula's has all-day HH on Saturdays (ending at 7pm), these beauties will set you back only $5 each.  Bargain!  We kept telling ourselves "hey, we burned like 2,000 calories today.  We EARNED these!"  They came with a fruit garnish, so technically they were "health beverages", right?  :)  Our very cool waiter took good care of us, and even shared a little background on his detailed tattoo work.  While I don't have any ink, I love hearing the back stories behind people's art - interesting!    As the sun made it's way down on this good day, the deck, the fire pit and of course the Pain Killer elixr made all those bumps, bruises and scrapes earned on the trail just seem to disappear... for a while, anyway...

You know that you are really a "grown up" when you have clothes that require dry cleaning.  You know you are lazy when you have clothes that don't require dry cleaning but you just don't want to iron them yourself.  Either way, Delia's Cleaners is great.  I can bring in the saddest bunch of crumpled wrinkled mess and come back the next day to find everything cleaned, pressed and perfect.  Kind of like magic!  This location is open 7 days a week, has friendly staff and even offers drive-through service.  You can also bring back the hangers and plastic garment bags for recycling - love it!  While they are a little pricey, coupons can be found on the website and even better ones (40% off!) are frequently in the mass-mail coupon packs.  Do you love your clothes?  Do you want to look pressed and polished?  Take your things to Delia's!

It took four years of driving Phoenix freeways to finally encounter The Evil Rock That Cracked My Windshield.  What started as a small crack quickly grew into a big one, so repair would not be an option.  I needed a new windshield.  My car is a convertible, which makes the windshield replacement process a little more complicated than most.  I wanted a company that was highly recommended to do a good job, and am very happy I chose Blue Chip!  Christine, who scheduled my appointment, was incredibly helpful in working with my insurance company to establish a claim and verify coverage.  Her patience was appreciated!  On the day of my appointment, she also gave me a call when the installers were 15 minutes from my office (ahead of schedule!).    When the installers arrived they quickly got to work, and my car was finished within an hour.  Perfect!    The Evil Rock is now just a memory in my rear-view mirror...

Oooh!  A shiny new pizza spot!  I have been told time and time again to try Barro's, so the opening of this location was the perfect opportunity to put it to my pepperoni and mushroom test.  All I can say is What Took Me So Long!?  This pizza is GOOD!  Zesty sauce, ample topping coverage and a puffy pillow-like outer crust.  It looks like it would be chewy, but it is not.  How do they do that?  Some sort of pizza alchemy, I am sure.  This location is brand new.  The dark wood floors and high-backed booths (that don't yet have butt-indentations from previous guests) are not the typical plastic red/green/white decor what you would expect from a casual pizza restaurant.  The staff is friendly, both on the phone and in person, which is nice.    In addition to fantastic whole pies, they also have inexpensive lunch specials (2 slices and a soda for $4 is my favorite!) until 4pm every day.  My only small sadness is that this location does not deliver to my house (even though it is closer than the Barro's that does cover my delivery area).  Oh well, I like this one and will probably visit more than is good for me!

For my 200th review, one of my favorite things!  Tom's Thumb Trail is by far my favorite hike.  After first discovering it three years ago, I keep going back for more!  It is a roughly 5 mile out and back route with some challenging portions and 3,600 feet of elevation gain.  Your lungs and legs will definitely get a workout!  Starting off, you enjoy a deceptively flat section which quickly transitions to a number of fairly steep switchbacks that lead up and Up and UP.  Take time to catch your breath and enjoy the view!  What I consider the 'middle' part of the hike is a more moderate section that has a lot of really interesting rock formations, cactus, cholla and other prickly plants you don't want to touch.  In the distance, you can even see the Fountain Hills fountain on a clear day.  The final portion (before turning back) leads up to The Thumb and requires just a little bit of scrambling.  At the top, be sure to touch The Thumb - it is good luck!  :)  Be safe and bring plenty of water - while the new trail head has restrooms, no running water is available.  Enjoy!!

I think I may have the fastest growing trees in all of Arizona.  It seems that their entire goal is to grow large enough to touch my roof line and extend into the yards of my neighbors.  With the the start of monsoon season, I wanted to have them trimmed before a strong wind sent branches flying, causing damage and generally making me unpopular with the neighbors.  :)    After obtaining a few estimates, I chose Chip off the Old Block.  Jack, a certified arborist, clearly explained what needed to be done to my trees and didn't try to upsell me on anything I didn't need (i.e. fertilizer treatments, etc.).  While his bid was not the lowest, he agreed to meet the price I received from another company that was also fully insured.  Also, he was able to accommodate my travel schedule and have a crew at my house the following day, which was appreciated.  The crew of three arrived (complete with a wood chipper!) a little earlier than scheduled, which was great.  They quickly got to work, and both of my trees were back in shape in a little over an hour.  They gathered each and every branch, including the ones that fell into my neighbor's yard.  Compared to other tree trimmers I have used, they did a better job in significantly less time!    So, when the trees grow out of control again (and they will) I know who to call to keep them on my side of the fence.

Who doesn't like noodles?    While you can get noodle-based dishes almost anywhere, China Magic Noodle is special.  Theirs are hand-pulled to order, by someone I can only describe as a Magic Noodle Man.  From the window between the dining room and kitchen you can watch the stretching spinning process as they are created, just for you!  While I love the noodles (and I have tried four of the five varieties offered), the real attraction for me are the steamed dumplings.  They also have a pan-fried version, but I like the steamed ones better.  They are amazing - beautiful, huge, pork-filled packets of goodness.  I have at times skipped the other dishes entirely and just had dumplings - they are that good.  What would happen if that Magic Noodle Man decided to go on vacation?  Or realized that hand-pulling noodles was no longer his career calling?  I can tell you that for me, the world would be a little less Magic.

'There is no way we are going to finish all of this'   This is what we told ourselves we stared at the sizable amount of food placed in front of us.  What possessed us to order two double cheeseburgers, fries AND onion rings?  We wanted them. That is why.   I can see how easy it is to over-order at Rocket Burger. Everything looks good. Cheese fries with real cheese? Yes! Rocket (onion) Rings that magically and mysteriously aren't greasy? Yes! Tender, juicy burgers with lots o' cheese? Yes, Yes, Yes!   Rocket Burger isn't fancy. It isn't a 'dress to impress' destination. In fact, it appears that maybe once upon a time it was a convenience store. Coolers line one wall containing a fascinating assortment of beverages, including one whole section dedicated to root beer, and one drink the owner admits tastes like 'tree'. Really, tree. If you can't find it here, it probably doesn't exist!   The charm in Rocket Burger is that it isn't trying to be something it is not. In fact, you can see the whole open kitchen area behind the counter/cash register. It is simply good food, prepared and served by friendly owners and staff.   Oh and yes, we ate it all. :)

Once upon a time I thought the greatest thing that could come from a truck was ice cream.  Not anymore.  Let me tell you a little about Torched Goodness - the best thing on wheels!  Torched Goodness is a mobile food truck that serves up oh so very decadent crème brulee.  Made fresh with local ingredients and torched to order, this stuff is truly amazing.  I recently started using twitter, and for the past week followed (OK, stalked) Torched Goodness (torchedgoodness) to see when I would have my chance at one of my favorite dessert treats.  Early Saturday I get the call - my friend knows the truck will be at the North Scottsdale farmers market - Let's Go!!  I don't think I have ever gotten out the door so quickly.  Once we arrived, I wanted to start running toward the truck like the Griswold family ran towards Wally World, but managed to hold myself back.  Getting to that truck felt like the longest 50 yards ever.    We were greeted by Chef Eric Ireland - the chef/owner/crème brulee master (trained at Le Cordon Bleu!) who was kind enough to let us sample multiple flavors.  Each one seemed better than the last.  Creamy and flavorful, but not overpowering.  After much debate, we settled on vanilla and lavender (we will eventually try them all, I am sure!).  Then the fun really started.  Chef fired up the torch and put a perfect crust on the top of the generously-sized portions.  Did I mention these beauties are only $4?  Good luck finding that anywhere else!  While we enjoyed our tasty treats, we were able to chat with Chef Ireland about the truck (not so good for the highway!), the various locations he visits, and how much he enjoys what he does.  Want some crème brulee at your next event?  He caters, too!  Hmmm... my birthday is coming up...    Great way to start the weekend - crème brulee really is the breakfast of champions.

If you want to over-pay for a mediocre meal and spend most of your visit wishing you were somewhere else, I highly suggest Tuscan Oven.  We should have known right from the start that we were in for a less than stellar experience  - Tuscan Oven was the only spot in Westgate that did not have a 45 minute wait.  Since we had fantastic tickets for the Coyotes/Sharks game and didn't want to miss any of the action (our seats were great!), we went with the restaurant option that could seat us immediately.  Ooops...  We ordered a half carafe of the house Pinot Noir - while it arrived quickly, it came complete with two straight out of the dishwasher hot glasses that tasted like soap and really did not do much to enhance the flavor of the wine.  Yum...  Our waitress apologetically replaced the soapy wine (she is the only reason to add a star to this review - she was trying her best).  We then ordered baked ziti and a wedge salad to share - and proceeded to wait an incredibly long time for two seemingly simple dishes.  While the ziti was OK (how can you mess up pasta with cheese & sauce?) the wedge salad had the skimpiest portion of bland disappointing blue cheese dressing I have seen.  Now I know iceberg lettuce is not exactly flavorful, but due both to the wimpy dressing (flavorless even after adding more) and practically nonexistent garnish (bacon, blue cheese crumbles) this salad was like eating crunchy water.  Blech.

Rounding up to 4 stars...  After a recent food-fest of brunch overindulgence at the Wandering Horse Buffet, in an effort to 'walk it off' we took a tour of the recently-opened Spa at the Talking Stick resort.   The shiny new facility looked like a great place to take my mom during her upcoming Thanksgiving visit, so I decided then and there to make massage appointments. After all, what better way to prepare for a day of eating than to have a relaxing massage? Even better, for making the appointments that day, I received a 20% discount - yay!   Jump to the day before Thanksgiving and I am more than ready for some pampering and relaxation. Located on the 14th floor, the Spa is a tranquil space with floor-to-ceiling windows offering amazing views. The locker room overlooks a golf course and some beautiful mountains that I wish I could name, but can't. Even the whirlpool and showers have expansive views (oh I hope that was one-way glass!).   We both had 90-minute massages - I had the Therapeutic Deep Tissue, and my mom had the Simply Swedish.  We both emerged relaxed and refreshed - and that is the whole point, right?   While we really enjoyed our visit, there is room for improvement.  I like to receive a confirmation on the day before spa appointments, and this didn't happen.  At the spa itself, the dressing/sink area did not have the standard toiletries that are usually present at a spa (Q-tips, hair products, facial moisturizer). Also, the only available water was in the 'quiet room' where guests wait for their appointments. It would have been nice to have a water/fruit station next to the whirlpool and sauna area.    Are any of these things deal-breakers?  No, but I think a few small changes will make the experience even better.

Sometimes I just want a slice (or two!) of pizza.  Nothing fancy.  Nothing wood-fired or artisan.  No three hour wait.  No ingredients I can't pronounce.  Just pizza.  Pizza with puffy crust, red sauce and gooey cheese.  That's it.  That said, I was looking forward to the opening of this Barro's location, as it is within lunchtime range of my office.  Thanks to Alexander C's review, I knew that the 'Coming Soon' sign finally changed to 'Now Open'.  Yay!    To be sure this new location was just as good as the other Barro's that I have grown to love, I had to try out a couple of pepperoni slices.  After all, quality control is important, right?  I am happy to say the 'za was warm, soft and cheesy - just what I wanted.

Mmmmm...  garlic!  A recent Sunday afternoon found us wandering around the Scottsdale Quarter.  It was around 3pm, and many of the restaurants were in the lull between lunch and dinner - a great opportunity to try the newest Grimaldi's location without a crowd.    It is no secret that I am a fan of pizza.  While I am typically a 'pepperoni and mushroom' kind of girl, having visited the Grimaldi's DC Ranch location I knew exactly what to get - the White with Garlic pizza.  It is a simple sauceless combination of flavorful cheese and garlic.  Lots of garlic.  And that is a good thing.  We ordered the large, which proved to be much bigger than expected - it nearly covered the entire high-top bar table, making it interesting to juggle plates, pizza, wine (house Montepulciano) and water glasses.  Hey, there are worse problems to have!  I look forward to enjoying more of that coal-fired garlicy goodness soon!

An interesting concept that didn't end up being what I hoped for.    I was pretty excited to try the Posh Noodles & Noshes Japanese street food as prepared by Josh Hebert.  I love Japanese food and was looking forward to the dishes that are not readily available in Phoenix.  Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by both the venue and the food.  The location inside the Lexington Hotel has definitely seen better days.  An attempt has been made to create a temporary generic space with chalkboard walls and butcher paper topped tables.  However, it came across as worn and dingy.  Our waitress was not familiar with the menu or drink offerings ('I didn't work here last night') but was friendly and did find out answers from other staff.  Foolishly thinking that we would love each and every dish and take home a lot to enjoy the next day, we tried a large assortment.  An expensive mistake.  Duck Gyoza w/ Ponzu - I prefer steamed gyoza over the fried presentation here.  Also, these had the tiniest, greasy portion of filling I have ever seen.  Homemade Tofu w/ Ginger, Scallion, Cherry Blossom - this was good, with a sweet, dessert-like flavor but a somewhat runny texture.  Okonomiyaki - this 'Japanese pizza' was among the better items.  However, the texture of the ingredients was strange - i.e. full slices of bacon rather than smaller bite-sized pieces made greasier than it needed to be and messy to eat  Tako Yaki - again, a strange texture with awkward large chunks of octopus surrounded by 'breading' that fell apart easily  The ramen dishes (Miso Ramen w/ Pork, Goma Ramen w/ Pork and Shitake Mushroom Rames) were small, and more or less indistinguishable from one another.   We left most of them behind, deciding not to take anything with us.  The dessert, Green Tea Pot de Crème was a nice finish but did not make me feel better overall about the $100+ meal.

Mmmm... best Birthday Brunch ever!  Arcadia Farms is adorable.  Sitting on the front patio for Sunday Brunch I felt like I should be wearing some sort of hat and perhaps a floral dress.  No need - mimosas can be just as easily consumed in jeans!  Our server was fantastic - once determining that all four of us were having mimosas, she recommended getting a bottle of champagne & carafe of OJ as opposed to separate drinks - less expensive and more bubbly!  So, right off the bat I knew I liked her.  My esteem only grew when halfway through our meal the hostess accidentally removed our champagne bucket from the nearby empty table where we were keeping it.  Our server (gosh I wish I could remember her name!) chased it down and brought it back like a hero!    OK, on to the food.  Shortly after we ordered, our rockstar server brought us a plate of complimentary strawberry scones, since she thought our food might be delayed since a party of 14 had just ordered.  Delicious!  It did not seem to me like our meals took a long time to arrive, either.  My friends enjoyed their entrees (French toast, black bean omlette and egg strada cobbler).  I loved mine too - I had the Crepes "Croque-Monsieur" (no, I can't pronounce that).  Crepes filled with ham & gruyere cheese and topped with bechamel sauce.  I prefer savory vs. sweet and these were spot on.  We finished our "ladies who brunch" experience with dessert - cute little cakes filled with rasberry and chocolate mousse.    After all of that wonderful food, the rest of the day was kind of a blur...  Love, love, love Arcadia Farms and can't wait to go back.  This will be my new "go to" spot for out of town guests!

Ice Cream Cookie.   Three words that are near and dear to my heart. What makes this delectable treat from Churn so special? They are made to order, and you can create your own combination from their assortment of ice cream and cookie flavors (made fresh daily)!   Overwhelmed by the possibilities, I fell back on the fondly familiar and went with vanilla bean ice cream embraced by a chocolate chip and a double chocolate chip cookie. Oh yes!  Served in a cute cup (hey, the good stuff can get messy), it was the perfect treat for a warm Saturday afternoon.  Big enough for sharing, too!  I was so enamored by my dessert that I probably didn't pay close enough attention to all of the other wonderful things Churn has to offer. To me, that is a perfect excuse to go back... soon!

I am a bit accident prone when it comes to electronics.  I drop cell phones.  And laptops.  It almost seems like the more expensive the item is, the more likely I am to damage it.  To try and reduce the probability of an Unfortunate Accident hurting the beautiful screen on my shiny new iPad, a co-worker recommended Ghost Armor.  Just in case.  On a recent visit to Kierland, I stopped by the kiosk.  I learned that the product can be applied to just the screen, or around the entire device.  Since I didn't like the look of 'seams' on the corners I decided to go with the screen only.  I didn't have my iPad with me, and was offered the option to purchase a gift card to use later and receive a $5 discount.  Well OK!  A couple of days later I returned, iPad in hand, and had no problem with redeeming the gift card.  The screen protection was installed in 15 minutes and I was on my way.  I was told not to turn on the iPad for a couple of hours, and not to put it into any 'enclosed spaces' such as a cover, case or purse for a couple of days.  So far so good!  Unless I look very closely at the edges of the iPad screen, I can't see the cover at all.  Also, the installation has a 7 day warranty, so if there are any issues I can bring it back and have them corrected at no cost.

Oooohhh....   Shiny objects!  David Yurman is my favorite jewelry designer, and I was pretty excited when this store (the first and only Yurman store in AZ) opened a couple of years ago.  Since then, I have visited more times than I like to admit - sometimes to buy and others just to daydream.  The staff is consistently friendly and helpful, but never pushy.  I especially like that they will offer to clean my other Yurman pieces while I browse.  Their special attention makes even the pieces I wear nearly every day look new!  :)  One thing to note - while the store has an impressive selection of beautiful creations, it seems that many of the items on display are the most expensive version of the collection.  I prefer the simpler pieces, which aren't always up front and center.  That said, if you are looking for a particular something special, don't be afraid to ask!  On a couple of occasions I have gone in looking for specific things that I didn't see displayed, and they were available from the drawers behind the display cases.  Looking forward to my next new shiny something!

I never thought I would want to arrive earlier than necessary at an airport... to eat!  Well, now that Sauce is open in PHX Sky Harbor, I make it a point to show up extra early for my flights.  Friendly staff and quick, efficient service make Sauce an oasis in the middle of traditionally less than stellar dining options at the airport.  The whole process couldn't be easier - order at the register, take your number and grab a seat.  I like the long high top tables - great for airport people watching.  In less time than it takes to connect to the airport WiFi, your food will be ready.  I have yet to venture farther into the menu than pizza, because I am perfectly happy with that.  A thin crust pizza paired with a generous glass of wine is a nice pre-travel treat, in my opinion.  And, doesn't that glass of wine make the whole security checkpoint process that much more tolerable?  :)

After reading through a few less than complimentary reviews, I was hesitant to give The Grind a try.  I am happy I decided to see for myself - it was very good!  First off, our waiter Anthony was friendly and attentive.  He pointed out a few of the more popular menu items and allowed plenty of time for making drink and burger choices.  It was tough, because there were quite a few to choose from that looked tasty.   I enjoyed everything I tried -   Grilled asparagus starter, which was served with goat cheese and greens.  The asparagus was prepared just the way I like it, a bit crispy.  The goat cheese and citrus dressing on the greens was a nice addition.  My mushroom burger (a 10 oz monster!) was a great choice.  The flavor of the beef was complimented by the roasted mushrooms, swiss cheese and arugula.  No sauces or condiments needed with this one!  The herbed fries were fresh cut and not too salty, and the portion was perfect for sharing - a nice presentation, too.  Last but not least, the warm doughnuts with salted caramel were a sweet finish to the meal.  I only wish the donuts were a bit larger.  Hey, who doesn't want more of a good thing?   I definitely plan on visiting The Grind again soon.  There are a few drink specials that are tempting (specialty cocktails 50% off after 5pm on Thursdays!), as well as a side of mac n cheese that is calling my name...

Airport and Pizza.  Two words that seemingly don't go together.  Who hasn't experienced scary airport food at one time or another?  Well, thanks to the new LGO in the airport, that is a thing of the past.  Airport + LGO Pizza = YUM!  :)  While I am aware that LGO has plenty of other great things besides pizza, (breakfast, sandwiches, burgers...) once I saw the wood-fired oven I knew I had to have one.  I chose the basic cheese pizza, which was anything but plain.  Perfectly cooked with a crisp yet somewhat chewy crust and a blend of bubbling savory cheeses.  Large enough to share, but I am not ashamed to say I ate every last bite!  Really?  A wood-fired oven in the airport?  I may have to travel more often...

When I saw the original Cavalia nearly four years ago, it was like nothing I had ever experienced.  Odysseo raised the bar to an entirely new level.  Odysseo is staged in an enormous tent (the largest of its kind!) which includes amphitheater type seating, a stage/arena area that is larger than a hockey rink and a video display larger than three IMAX screens.  Impressive.  Well, impressive until you see the horses.  From the moment the music started and the lights came up, my breath was taken away.  Horses and performers interacting.  Running, jumping and playing.  Many of the acts featured horses without any sort of restraint, demonstrating the remarkable love and trust between horse and trainer.  At one time, there were 30 horses on the 'stage' area at once.  All moving in synchronized groups of three or four, guided only by their focus on the trainer's cues - words and gentle touches.  Spectacular.  As if all of that weren't enough, Odysseo dazzled with live musicians and vocalists, dancers, acrobats and trick riders.  So many talented people all under one big top!  If you are on the fence about seeing either Cavalia or Odysseo (let's be honest, the tickets aren't inexpensive) GO!  You will love every minute, just like I did.  ** Just in case you were wondering, not one of the equine performers 'fertilized' the stage area.  Now that is training.  :)

A lot of goodness in this little building!  The Stand has become one of my favorite spots for burgers and fries.  Yes, they do make other things, but I have yet to venture any further down the menu board.  Yet.  The building is small, but the space is used efficiently with both indoor and outside seating.  The staff is friendly and enthusiastic - they seem to genuinely like working there, and keep things running quickly.  I am hooked on The Standard (with cheese, of course) - a juicy, cheesy creation of beauty pillowed within a fresh egg bun.  I choose to have mine without onions or tomato, keeping the fresh crisp lettuce and crunchy pickles.  Just the right amount of sauce rounds out this treat of a burger.    What is a burger without fries?  The Standard's fresh-cut fries are fantastic.  Not at all greasy, the portion is more than enough to share.  Well, unless you are me, and greedily hoard them all for myself.  Get your own.

Guess what?!  There is a real sushi bar in Desert Ridge, and it is GOOD!  I was a little skeptical when Nori first opened, because Desert Ridge has not had the best luck with sushi (I lost count of how many places have opened and closed in the past few years).  However, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked everything about this latest (and greatest!) sushi spot.  The restaurant has a really open and airy feel, with an indoor/outdoor bar and high ceilings.  The sushi bar is large, with plenty of seating to enjoy the view of the chefs working their sushi magic.  There is also booth and table seating, if the sushi bar isn't for you.    I have enjoyed everything I tried - some favorites are:  Yellowtail sashimi - perfectly fresh and sweet, a great presentation served over crushed ice  Ahi tuna tataki roll - a savory blend of spicy tuna, asparagus and cucumber topped with seared ahi and sprinkled with crunchy fried onions.  I get mine without avocado, and love it.  All of the nigiri has been fresh and flavorful as well - definitely try the salmon, freshwater eel and spicy scallops.  Yum!  Thank you, thank you for adding great sushi to Desert Ridge!!

I like Pomo so much that on a recent visit back to AZ I had to go twice!  I like this location much more than the previous Borgata version, and the delicious pizzas were something I knew I would miss when I moved away.    So...  Pomo was the first dinner spot I chose during my last trip back, and I was looking forward to some great pizza, wine and conversation.  3 people means we should share 3 pizzas, right?  Yes, there were left overs.  Some.  A little.    Principe:  This is by far my favorite.  Pomo's perfect thin crust graced with prosciutto crudo di parma, arugula, and shaved parmigiano reggiano.  I just cannot get enough.  Quattro Formaggi:  What is better than one cheese?  Four!  The fresh basil makes this creation even better.  Bufala Verace:  This is a classic Napoletana preparation, topped with delicious imported Mozzarella di Bufala Campana DOP, basil and EVOO.  I loved it as well, but wish there were even more of the mozzarella goodness.  A few days later, asked to select a lunch destination, I did not hesitate to suggest Pomo's outside patio.  This time between two people we shared the Principe (I said I can't get enough) as well as a Mista salad (the shaved parmigiano reggiano and balsamic vinegar topping the fresh greens earn this a spot in my heart).  Oh, and the nice chianti that rounded out the leisurely lunch didn't hurt either.  The location is great, and the layout with both indoor and covered patio seating makes it a good choice for an intimate meal or a get together with a larger group.  Can you open one in Orange County?  Please?  Just like you can expect summers in AZ to be hot, you can expect me to be back at Pomo as soon as possible.

What do a toilet brush, Hello Kitty stickers, a pink BBQ lighter and macaroni and cheese have in common?  I can find all of these things and more at Target!    I like this Desert Ridge Target location.  It is consistently clean and well-organized.  The staff is friendly and the store is large without being ridiculously overwhelming.  From household cleaning supplies to dog treats to nail polish remover, Target has what I want when I need it.  I even find things I didn't know that I needed - the blessing and curse of Target...  Shouldn't everything in life be this simple and satisfying?
