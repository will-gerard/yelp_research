Last night was my first adult play experience. I have been to the theater to see the Nutcracker when I was a kid and I saw the Lion King in New York when I was a kid as well. I remember them being fun, but that's about the extent of my memories of the theater. There happened to be a groupon for the play "The Mystery of Irma Vep" that my mom purchased for the four of us (mom, myself, husband, sister) to attend.   We got there a bit early after dinner and walked around the theater looking at the art that was up around the building. There were places you could grab a drink and relax before the show. At our call time we went in and found our seats. We were up on the balcony in the fifth row pretty much right in the center. We had really good seats. The only thing about this theater that made me uncomfortable and keeps it from attaining that fifth star were first of all the seats. The backs were extremely straight and having a back condition it makes sitting up that straight difficult for long periods of time. The second thing that was a bit uncomfortable was the temperature of the theater. It was a bit warmer than I would have liked. I left coated in a film of sweat. Not pleasant. I was nervous I wasn't dressed appropriately having never been to the theater before, I went in jeans and a t-shirt, but I am glad now that I did because it would have been much more uncomfortable in one of my nice silk dresses than in jeans.   However the show was hilarious. The part that made it for me was when one of the characters started singing the Rebecca Black "Friday" song. Classic! Most of the people in the theater didn't get the reference so there were only a few pockets of young people laughing when it happened. But I found it to be a nice touch and after a play full of references I didn't get, I liked that there was something for us young folk thrown in. The rest of the show was funny, and I am glad that I got to experience it.   After coming here I am interested in becoming more active in plays and am looking into seeing a ballet soon. All of us really enjoyed this, and I was surprised my husband liked this as much as he did. A good time had by all!

When I want to go out but not spend $100 on entertainment and also get some exercise in at the same time and see some beautiful Arizona landscape, the Desert Botanical Gardens is the best place I can go. I enjoy walking around the Garden looking at all of the flowers in bloom and all of the different kinds of cactus. I also enjoy when they have different exhibits that you can see as you are wandering the garden. I really enjoyed the Chihuly Glass artwork that was displayed a few years back.   Probably my favorite time of the year to come here is when they have the butterflies. They are so pretty and this year there were so many of them! We went this last weekend on my day off and the weather was perfect and we just had a great time. I also get to brush up on my photography skills here the best because I can take some amazing pictures of flowers and butterflies.   If you want to see what the Arizona desert is all about, you need to come here to experience it first hand. Its not only about dirt and cacti. There are flowers galore as well.

Today was a whirlwind of a day. Before my husband and I set out on our groupon redeeming adventure all over Phoenix, we decided to stop in here for lunch. This is the first time I have been in here to eat since becoming vegetarian almost a year and a half ago, and before then we used to come in all of the time. At least once a month to get some sandwiches while we were out shopping in this part of town. Today I decided would be a good day to check this place back out, as I was craving sandwiches anyways. We must have come in at an off time because it wasn't very crowded. But then again, most people don't eat lunch at 3pm. There was a musician playing out on the patio for a few guests.  We walked in and my husband and I both decided on the Where's the beef? sandwich, which was lettuce, tomato, avocado, jicama, celery, sprouts, cucumber, swiss cheese, mayo and mustard. I got mine on an onion roll and my husband decided on whole wheat. We paroozed the store while we were waiting for our sandwiches and we also purchased a large bottle of water and chips. There is also a little section inside where you can purchase teas, coffees, jams, spices, oils, kitchen tools, among other items. I can't say that I have ever bought any of these items but some of them are pretty interesting. Today I saw boxed potatoes. I don't know why but I thought it was the strangest thing ever.   Anyways. So our sandwiches are ready and we pay and we sat upstairs overlooking the rest of the store. I dig into my sandwich and I really love it. I'm a sandwich slut anyways so its easy to make me happy, but there were a ton of veggies. I didn't feel like I was gipped at all. Most sandwich places will give you the flattest sandwich possible. But this one was large and in charge. I got full half way through and still ate the whole thing because of how good it tasted. I think the value for a sandwich like this is just about the same as every other sandwich shop I have had that has a vegetarian option. It was $7, which is about average. So I don't feel like I was robbed or anything. We will definitely be back soon!

After my husband's and my experience with facials on our vacation in May, we were happy to see a groupon for A New U Day Spa come up on groupon almost right after we returned. I read the description of the facial the groupon was promoting, which was the ultimate deep pore facial, and purchased it. Since my husband and I both still have iffy skin we thought this would be perfect for us. Making appointments was a little bit of a hassle, just because of how many groupons were sold and the dates we were able to schedule. We ultimately made appointments for late September on a Saturday afternoon.  The day of our appointment we showed up about fifteen minutes early so we could both fill out some paperwork regarding our skin. While the fact that this Spa is in a strip mall like location doesn't bother me as much as some reviews I have read on other sites, the waiting area sort of does. There were not enough places to sit and there was a large group of women waiting for other services when we showed up. My husband ended up standing till we were called into the back. There is a little sitting area for those getting facials in the back, which is nice since its secluded from the rest of the Spa.   Suzanne though, is the friendliest facialist I have ever met, hands down. She was open, warm and welcoming. She asked if I had any issues with my skin I needed addressed and asked all the right questions. It didn't feel weird that I didn't talk to her that much during my facial like it has with others. I am one of those people who like to zone out during a facial and talk makes it less enjoyable. My husband is the opposite. He likes to talk and him and Suzanne talked throughout his entire facial. Each of us had a different experience based on our skin types. I had a pumpkin mask and my husband had another kind. Both of us were really happy with our experience. The only issue I did end up having was I ended up really red for the next couple of days. I might have more sensitive skin than I realized and it ended up being almost like a sun burn, with peeling and everything.   As we were leaving, Suzanne even gave us a discount to come back before the end of the year. I don't know that we will be able to get back before then, but I will definitely come back to have Suzanne do another of my facials. She was great. The rest of the staff is friendly as well. They talked to my husband and I for almost half an hour after our appointments. I recommend this Spa.

I have been to two pita jungle locations. This one is probably the worse of the two. I have eaten in this establishment, ordered online, called for a to go orders, and ordered to go at the location itself. First I will start with the food.   Food: I actually really like the food at Pita Jungle. Granted, I have only had 3 or so items off of the menu. The entree I get the most often is the Hummus and Tabbouleh salad with pita. I love their hummus. It is so creamy with the right amount of flavor. I always get a large order so I can have some for lunch the next day. The tabbouleh is ok. I have not had any other tabbouleh salad to compare it to, but usually I have to add my own flavorings because its pretty bland. Its parsley with cracked wheat, some tomatoes and onions. I usually squeeze some lemon juice on it, and then add the garlic and oil from my garlic mushrooms that I order (which I love. Garlic and mushrooms. Honestly, what's not to love?) as well to give it some extra flavor. If they did that on their own it would be great. Its also pretty watery so I have had to ask for it on the side, or extra dry. But this should be done automatically, because who wants watery tabbouleh sitting on top of hummus, which then also gets watery? Nobody! I have also had the falafel pita, which is ok. Sometimes the falafel balls have been really good, other times overcooked and almost burned. Its hit or miss. I have also had the 1000 beans. Pretty good. I have had the trio of hummus before but I prefer the original flavor. The roasted red pepper just didn't taste very good, and the jalapeno wasn't spicy at all.   Eating in the restaurant: We have had a few different waiters. Usually when we have the guys they are more friendly. But the women that work here are rude and cold. We haven't had a problem with any of our food eating in the restaurant. But we have had to wait for long periods of time for our waiters to come around once in awhile. Even when it is not busy in here. Everyone here is apparently allowed to dress as they please. Last night I was in here and some girls bra was hanging out of her shirt. I am sorry, but nobody wants to see that when they are eating dinner. No matter how cute you think you look. Its trashy. They seriously need some sort of dress code in these places, even if its just jeans and a t-shirt that covers your boobs.   Ordering online: There have been problems with this to the point I don't do it anymore. Some items they offer in the restaurant are missing from the options to choose from online. I have ordered online, gone to the store to pick up, and my order was missing. Then the girl who takes to go orders, called every single other pita jungle location in Arizona to find my order. Seriously? Just place a new order. There have also been times where I order something, and it didn't show up on my order, so I end up waiting around an extra 10 minutes because they have to make it after all of my other food has already been finished. I would say skip ordering online.   Call in orders and ordering at the restaurant: The girl who is in charge of to go orders is extremely rude and snobby. She never says hello when we walk into the store. Just stares at us until we order. Uncomfortable. And then when we do order, she seems like its such a labor intensive job when we order 4 things. Get a grip girl. I have also ordered my tabbouleh on the side before and then I never got it, even though I paid for it. I didn't realize this until I was at home already and was pissed but not enough to go back and let my food get cold over a salad. I also have paid for pitas I have not received. Just make sure if you order to go, check your bag of food before you leave to make sure you have gotten everything you have paid for. They must tie their bags in a knot for this reason, they want to gip you and not have you check. I learned my lesson. I check every time now.   I like the food (hummus) enough at Pita Jungle to keep coming back, but I should probably look for a more friendly location to frequent. This one just doesn't vibe well with me. So I will give this place 2 stars for the food. But 0 stars for everything else.

Rubio's is my favorite place to get some vegetarian tacos that I don't have to drive all the way downtown for. The grilled portabello and poblano gourmet tacos make me happy. They made me sad for awhile because for some reason they were taken off of the menu for a few months, and during that time I boycotted Rubio's. But as soon as I found out that they were back I came in to get my beloved tacos. Baby portabellos, poblano peppers, avocados, cheese, and some kind of spicy cream sauce all on a corn tortilla. Mmmmmm!  I also like their chips, they aren't like eating a salt lic like the chips at Chipotle. They are just the right amount of salty. The salsa that I like the best is the roasted chipotle salsa. Its got this really nice smokey flavor. I wish I could buy that at the store and eat it all of the time. I've had all of the other salsas at other times but I don't care too much for them. I also am not a fan of their beans that come with the meal. Most of the time they are really watery and I am just not a fan.  I come to this location the most often, and the only thing bad about it is they have this really strange guy who works there and who is mostly always there when we come in, who likes to get a little too personal for me. Tone it down, dude. But other than that, I can't complain about this place.

California Pizza Kitchen has always been one of those places that everyone can agree on. The menu is big enough where there is something for everyone and usually everyone walks away happy. Lately though, the quality of the food as gone way down.   Before I went vegetarian I used to always get the chicken waldorf salad and it was always so good. I love the blue cheese and the candied walnuts. They were addicting. Since I've become vegetarian I settled on the hummus appetizer, grilled vegetable salad, and the wild mushroom pizza. Recently though, they have completed revamped the menu, adding new items, taking old favorites off. For some places, menu changes mean new and exciting food opportunities and makes the visit to that place even better. Not for CPK.   Recently, since beginning to use yelp, I have wanted to try new places and veer away from old favorites or places that I am used to. However, I tend to have friends and family members who are food-borists... Ya I just invented a new word. A food-borist is someone who never wants to try anything new, and will eat at the same place and order the same exact thing all of the time. My friends are this way. It never fails. Any time one of them has a birthday I get an invitation to eat at CPK and every time I groan. Even before I swore off CPK forever, I was getting extremely tired of it. The second to the last time I went was for my birthday with some friends. I ordered the new roasted vegetable salad and a cup of the vegetarian tortilla soup. I used to love the grilled vegetable salad and was pissed when they replaced it on the menu with roasted vegetable salad. Not good. I struggled through it because my friends paid for my dinner and I didn't want to waste their money. But it was gross, and I vowed never to order it again. The soup was good though. The last time I went was with my sister, husband and niece. This time I ordered the new caramelized peach salad. On the menu, most of the new items sound really good. Its just the execution of them that fails CPK. The peach salad was gross. The peaches were canned and then warmed, and I also saw no caramelization whatsoever. The combination of the peaches with the gorgonzola (my favorite cheese of all time) was so unappetizing. I didn't even get through half of the salad before I said forget it. My husband ordered the garlic cream fettuccine and added sauteed mushrooms and was upset by this as well. The portion size was really small and it was extremely salty. My sister ordered the barbecue cobb salad which was almost entirely jicama. She barely ate half as well because it was just a giant jicama salad! They skimped on all of the other items in the salad and just pretty much covered some jicama in barbecue dressing.   The pricing at CPK has also become outrageous. It was almost $13 for my salad. For a salad! Does anyone else find that wrong? Considering the ingredients, my salad should have cost $7, tops! Pasta is expensive, pizzas were generally reasonable for awhile but those prices have been raised as well. For such a casual dining place the prices are just exorbitant. The service also sucks. Our waitress probably spent two minutes total the entire meal at our table. No refilled waters, no how is everything. She was just rushing around everyone else's table except ours.   So we all have made a vow never to return to any CPK. Especially the one in the Chandler Fashion Center. Before I went vegetarian, I got a lovely surprise one morning after eating here and was graced with food poisoning for two days. That was a great experience.

Its been almost two years since I have eaten at any of the Street's of New York restaurants, and I guess I expected it to be better than it was. And less expensive.   We wanted pizza for dinner one night but I was tired of all the regular delivery places so we decided to get some Street's. They don't deliver to our area so we picked up. We ordered the pear gorgonzola dinner salad and a medium thin crust margarita pizza. While the salad was good, there were hardly enough toppings to account for the $8 price tag. Maybe 1/8 of a cup of combined cheese, nuts and cranberries, along with four quarters of a pear which were canned on top of maybe half a bag of field greens. This is a tasty salad, and maybe enough for one small person to eat but not enough for any normal person to feel satisfied on. The pizza was also good, but again not worth the $16 it cost. Thin crust, no sauce, tomatoes, basil that I could smell but found no leaves (weird), topped with cheese. My husband could have polished this off on his own if I had let him. It was hardly filling. You think that going thin crust getting less calories should be less expensive as well since the amount of dough used is way less. But I guess I was wrong in that logic.   I was really disappointed. I used to really love Street's and would order from them all of the time but now its just become too expensive. I have been to many places where I can order way more for the $28 in total (with a small tip) that we spent here. It makes me sad but I probably wont be ordering from here again.

I have been going to this pizza place for about a year and a half now. Even though I graduated from ASU over three years ago, I had no idea this place existed until my husband went there one night with some buddies after a study session. He came home with a large piece of pizza that was so good, and while it was one of the biggest pieces of pizza I had seen at that time, I ate the whole thing.   I have been hooked since. The pizza slices are huge, the slice specials are very nicely priced, and it is never so crowded I hate coming here. I have been to this location and the one in East Mesa, and I have to say that this one is way better. The pizza just tastes better, even though its the exact same pizza. We usually only get slices. We tried a whole pizza one time, but for some reason it just didn't taste the same as the slices. I don't know what that's about but in my opinion the slices are a better value anyways. My husband and I can eat dinner of two slices each, and each with a drink for under $15. And that's a win in my book. I usually end up taking one of the slices home for lunch the next day as well. So I get more than one meal out of it.   If you want to eat some good, cheap pizza, definitely hit this place up. The pizza comes out hot, fast, and delicious. You wont be sorry you tried it.

I found this dry cleaner about two years ago after a rather unpleasant experience at a Prestige dry cleaners in Scottsdale. I had a dress dry cleaned there and it cost almost $20! For 1 item!! Needless to say I wanted to find a place cheaper and closer to my house. So after doing some online research I picked this place, which at the time had $2.25 per item cleaning and only took cash or debit cards.   I have always been satisfied by the quality of the cleaning done to my clothes here. I have gotten some pretty gnarly stains on some of my silk work dresses and they have always been able to get them out. One of the hazards of eating lunch at your desk I guess. I only had one incident where there might have been some damage done to one of my dresses but I wasn't too upset about it since the quality of the beading done on the dress was crappy at best. So I don't entirely blame them for a bunch of my beads falling off.   The only complaint I probably have is that they miscounted my items one time and I almost walked out missing a dress. And this seems to happen on some kind of regular basis because I have been in there a time or two when some guy is missing some shirts or someones dress has disappeared. I hope that if they do lose garments, management at least has the decency to replace for the lost cost. The workers aren't the most friendly but they aren't total jerks either. Just sort of... there.   I recommend this cleaner based on quality and price. However, in the last year the have upped their prices a bit because they got a new credit card machine and now they charge for all sorts of taxes. Either way, its still reasonable. But they do have a text service where they offer discounts and promotions sometimes. I have not participated in that yet but I know its out there.

We used to come here all of the time, when it was cheaper. Over the last year the prices of YC's has jumped up over two bucks. That's way too large of an increase for just one year. It is now $11.50 to eat dinner here. Even the lunch prices are outrageous, $9.50 for one trip. We stopped coming in awhile ago just because of the prices.  I always liked the food though. Vegetarians FYI, there is seafood stock in the YC's own sauce. I didn't know that originally but found out a few months after being vegetarian after I contacted the corporate office. They told me that the fish sauce and the YC's own sauce are the only two sauces with animal ingredients. Their veggies always seemed decent though.  Here is a tip: If you pack your bowl super full, enough that you know you can't eat it all, get your food to go. I would do this and they would put all of my food in two containers and I wouldn't have to pay the extra $.50 for the take out container they charge.

Riddle me this: How have I lived in Arizona all my life and never tried Barro's? Ya, I'm not sure either. Its a mystery to me too. But it so happens that now I have. And let me tell you... I'm hooked!  Its a Friday evening. I am having severe insomnia problems currently and I slept a total of two hours the night before. Its 5pm, I'm starving, I'm exhausted, and all I want to do is just go home and pass out. So my husband suggests we order a pizza and order from a place we have never had before so that way I don't have to cook. I suggest Barro's because we have never tried it and it's right down the street. I go online, look for coupons like I do everywhere, and we decide on two special pizzas, veggie and hot wing (with mushrooms in place of the chicken) for the current coupon special price of $12.99 each. Twenty minutes later we drive down to pick up our pizza to avoid delivery charges. I check them in the car to make sure no chicken has entered the space of my pizza and we are good to go.   Let me tell you something about Barro's. Its freaking amazing. I can't believe I had waited so long to try them and I'm kind of sorry I did. The pizza dough is thick, but not too thick, and fluffy. The toppings are plentiful. Definitely the most toppings I've seen on a pizza for that price. Its three days later, and we are still eating leftovers. It doesn't take four pieces of pizza to make us full like those other guys. Two will do it for us. The hot wing pizza is so freaking good. Hot wing sauce covered with mozzarella and cheddar cheese topped with mushrooms. You have to try this thing at least once in your life. I miss eating hot wings sometimes but this satisfies that craving. Its spicy and cheesy. So good!  My husband said to me that this should be our new delivery place whenever we want pizza. I agree with him.

When my husband was diagnosed with a brain tumor in March of 2010, our family doctors recommended Barrow to do the surgery to have it removed. We initially had an appointment with a different doctor, but because of scheduling conflicts we ended up going with doctor Alan Mitha, who is the fellow for Dr. Robert Spetzler.   Dr. Mitha was very knowledgeable about the procedure and kindly answered any questions or concerns we had about the surgery. He explained what the surgery would be like, complications that might arise from the surgery, and recovery time. We had my husbands operation set for May of 2010. The entire surgery took about 8 hours but we were kept updated through the entire process. Doctors would come out periodically and explain what was going on and how my husband was doing. When the surgery was completed both doctors came out to explain the entire thing to us.   We were very lucky to have been able to be in the state of one of the best neurosurgeons in the country. All of the doctors were very kind and understanding about how scared we both were and took their time making us feel comfortable. I highly recommend any of the doctors at this facility.

Bosa has become sort of a tradition for my husband and I before we head out on a road trip. We don't eat them any other time, but we always seem to end up here before taking off. I don't know if its because its early and we need the sugar to stay awake on the road, or if its something about doing something out of the ordinary. Either way, this is the place we come to grab a not so healthy pre road trip breakfast. This location is open 24 hours so if you were craving a doughnut at 3am you could come in and get one.  Usually we grab either a half or full dozen of the fresh doughnuts. I like the glazed kind the best, but the cake ones are good as well, just not my personal preference. My favorite flavors are the traditional glazed, twist glazed, lemon filled glazed, and the apple filled crumb covered ones. My husband is a fan of all of the chocolate kinds and usually gets the long johns and custard filled doughnuts. There are a bunch of other flavors if those don't happen to tickle your fancy.  As far as doughnuts go I would say these are pretty good. I like them better than Dunkin Doughnuts and places like Safeway and whatnot. They are pretty cheap, and you can also get a dozen doughnut holes for a buck. I would recommend you stop in and at least try one for yourself.  The only thing I would have to say about this place is the drive through is kind of annoying. It doesn't take very long to get in the store and get out with your goods, but people will still line up around the store for the drive through, which I think takes longer and blocks people from getting out of the parking lot. You are going to be eating a sugar covered dough ball. Just get out of your car and go in the store.

Oh Green! How do I love thee? Let me count the ways...  1. You are 100% vegan. I have a plethora of choices to eat from and not have to worry about what its made with and if its vegan or not.   2. Tsoynamis. Nuf' said.  3. Vegan crab puffs!!!  4. You have specials that change all of the time! I just wish you would make about 90% of these specials permanent menu items! I love some of them so much it depresses me when they run out or are no longer available. Example, the Chicken Schwarma wrap. I would KILL for that to be on the menu. It is my favorite thing ever.   5. Most of your staff are some of the coolest people ever, and always remember us. Its nice when staff remember you (and your favorite specials). It also helps that my husband and I have been here at least 50 times in the last year.   6. You don't just make me choose from a few measly salads. You have sandwiches, pizza, pasta, bowls, appetizers. The BBQ chicken and the Mexicali burgers are the greatest things ever.   7. You are relatively close to my house, and I don't have to trek 30 miles to get there. So if at 8pm I decide I want you, I can get to you and not have to worry about making it before you close.   8. You have an in store market where if I feel the need to pick up a box of vegan mac and cheese, I can.   There are tons of reasons to eat here, whether you are vegan or not. You have to try this place. It is amazing and no matter what you get off the menu, you will not be disappointed.

I have two words for this store. GHE-TTO! I really don't know what has happened to this section of Tempe over the last few years, but its become a tad rundown. The only reason I even gave this store two stars instead of one is because they recently renovated the inside of the store, and it does look a lot better. Before it looked like somebody threw a bunch of odds and ends together in an empty where-house and called it an electronics store. But since the remodel they have updated the layout so that it actually make sense now. The floors are all new. It just looks nicer when you walk in than it used to. So props for that.   Props for nothing else though. There are always about 100 employees hanging around the store talking to each other. And they are either following you around, or avoiding you. I have had both happen to me. I was walking around in the kitchen section one time waiting for my husband to be done with the computer section, and I had a male employee follow me up and down the isles until he caught up with me. I was avoiding you for a reason, creeper!! Most of the time though my husband wants to ask a question about something or try to find where a specific item is located, and either nobody makes eye contact with us to help us, or they have no clue what we are even talking about. Really? You work in an electronic store and you have no idea what a sled is? Its pathetic really. The only reason we keep coming here is because my husband likes to wander around for hours at a time.   If you have a choice, go to the location located in west Phoenix instead. It is WAY nicer and cleaner, and the people who work there actually know their shit.   And BTW, what the fuck is up with the receipt checkers? This isn't Costco! I am not obligated in any way to show you what I purchased. I usually hide all of my stuff in my gigantic purse so I don't have to show these jerk offs my receipts on my way out.

Why does this place have so many 1 and 2 star reviews? I just don't understand. I have been coming here for YEARS. Even before I went the vegetarian/vegan route. I used to have birthday party dinners here when I was a kid. This place has always been my favorite Mexican place to eat at, and is always super crowded with people. You should have seen it the day after the Superbowl. It was a mad house! But because I love it so, we still waited the thirty minutes and ate here anyways.  The service is sort of touchy. Some times we get really good servers who are friendly, and other times we get the ones who just rush and take your order and don't bother to care about you at all. Really though, as long as the service is fast, I could care less about whether or not they talk to me. It is just nice when they do.   The food is always hot, and always comes out super fast. I always order a bean chimichunga with no cheese, no sour cream, and all beans on the side with no cheese. The lettuce and tomatoes they put all over every dish is slightly annoying and I always forget to ask for them to take it off, but whatever. I love my bean chimi.   Whoever comes here and expects to get 5 star Mexican food is kidding themselves. You can tell from the outside of this place that when you come in here, you are going to get some greasy bad for you Mexican food. And that is exactly why I frequent this place. When I am in the mood to just eat greasy food that's going to make me feel like I just ate 3000 calories, I come here. Because even being a vegetarian, you have to have a place where you go to eat bad for you food.

This is the Pei Wei location I go to the most and it just so happens to be my favorite as well. Why? Well I will tell you. They have THE best tofu out of any of the locations I have been to. I don't know why the way it is cooked is so much more different here than it is at any of the other locations but for some reason it is. It almost has this crispy texture and is not white and slimy like I have experienced at other places.  I usually either get the Japanese Teriyaki or the Thai Dynamite with the tofu and vegetables and brown rice. My only complaint about either one of these is they don't put more tofu! Occasionally there will be a bit too much sauce and my rice will be swimming in it. There is always a large amount of vegetables that are always crisp and green.   This place is close to my work so usually when I forget lunch I hop online and order my lunch for the time I want to pick it up, and probably 9 times out of 10 it will be ready before I get there. I don't think I have ever eaten in the actual restaurant before so I can't comment on that, but the take out is fast and efficient.   See you on my next lunch break!

This is the kind of place that if it weren't for yelp, I probably never would have come here. I live literally right down the street from this place, and have driven by it about 30 times over the last two years. It always looks busy but I never had any desire to try this place. You see, I am a creature of habit. I will eat at the same five restaurants for months because I know there is something on the menu I can eat, and like. I am always hesitant to try new places or to just stop in somewhere new without knowing what I am walking into first. Thanks to yelp, and reading reviews, I realized this was a place I actually wanted to go.   I went for lunch today with my dad. I ordered the #12 vegetarian and my dad ordered the #38 club. He also ordered some random pork and shrimp dumplings that the guy at the counter handed to us cold and wrapped like it was bought at a gas station. He expected them to be hot and was a little put off by them. My dad would later call these "icky." So those are probably something we will steer clear of in the future.  The sandwiches came out super fast. I don't know what I was expecting because when it was sort of cold I seemed surprised. When I read about this sandwich on-line it said it had crispy tofu strips, so I guess I just assumed it would be hot. It was a fresh baguette with tofu, pickled carrot and daikon, jalapeno, and cilantro. I loved it! It could have used about double the amount of tofu but it had good flavors. It was just the right size for me. Not to big, not to small. I enjoyed my sandwich very much. My dad's club sandwich was huge. I had debated on ordering the avocado sandwich but was glad I didn't because his sandwich was gigantic. He liked his choice as well. The value for the food at this place is also great. We ordered two sandwiches, two drinks, and the two spring rolls, and it was less than fifteen bucks. That's awesome!  I will definitely be back here, probably quite often seeing as how its just a quick bike ride from my house. And even though they only take cash, that doesn't bother me one bit seeing as how they manage to keep their prices really low. I'm a fan!

Let me just start off by saying this; this place deserves a five star review. The only reason I am giving it four was because I was so frustrated trying to find this place I got extremely angry at one point.   Here is my story: This year for mothers day my sister and I decided that it would be a good idea to clean out my mother's spice collection. Pretty much 90% of my moms spices have been in her house since before she married my step dad--which was 12 years ago. And she still uses them!! Every time I go over to her house I give her grief about the 13 year old bottle of oregano or the 15 year old bottle of cloves. How she thinks these will evoke any kind of flavor into food, I have no idea. So when I found Penzey's Spices one day while searching through yelp, I got super excited! We decided that one weekend we would go down and totally start our mom from scratch. So this weekend, we planned our entire Saturday around Penzey's. So after breakfast we drive down Hayden and start searching for the store. We do this for at least 10 minutes. Circling back and forth, up and down the street. I probably used half a gallon of gas just looking for the store. My sister even put the address into GPS and it took us to the same location. Having no idea why we couldn't find this place, my sister called only to find out that they were now located in Tempe Marketplace. On none of the websites I looked at Saturday morning did they bother to update their address. Being in such a digital age you think that would be the first thing you change. So both of us were so annoyed we decided that we weren't going to drive down to Tempe Marketplace and that we would just do something else for our mom.   Later that day though after my sister had gone home, my husband and I decided to drive down to TM since its on our way home to check out the store. When we got there, we had no idea where in TM it was, so we drove in circles around the entire place again. We finally decided to get out of the car and just walk around to find it. We located a directory, where it said it was located in one place. When we got there it wasn't there. Pissed off again, we went back to the directory and found a different location where we finally found it. Let me just tell you, all of the running around trying to find this place, totally killed any joy I had once I got in there. If we had found this place on the first shot I would have been extremely thrilled to be in here. But here we were, hot, tired, at the end of the day, and we just wanted to get in and out. The entire time we were in this store my husband just wanted to leave because of how tired he was at that point. But I managed to salvage enough time to get my mother her present.  The store itself though, is amazing. Every spice you can imagine, or didn't even know existed, is most likely in this store. There are hundreds of kinds of spices and herbs, and all of them are available for you to smell in jars places by each one. I probably smelled almost half of them. They come in all forms as well. Whole, ground, diced, powdered, mixed.... it just goes on forever. I definitely will be coming back to this store now that I know where it is. And hopefully next time I will be in a better mood and have more time to kill to be able to check out every single spice in here. I can tell my spice collection might just be getter a bit bigger soon.

Sweet baby Jesus! I am carrying the most massive food baby right now.   My husband was craving pasta so I researched some new places we could go to get some. Oregano's seemed to be a big hit so we settled on this place for dinner tonight. Let me tell you... no matter how hard you try, you will not leave here hungry.   There was no wait for a table and we got to sit out on the patio. It was so nice outside tonight and the misters were going. It was very enjoyable. Our server was very friendly and fast. I like that the drink glasses are gigantic. Usually my husband and I drink water faster than it can be poured but these were so huge we only needed one refill the entire meal, and even before the glass was empty our server picked them up to get refilled. Points for that. I hate empty water glasses. We decided on the boom dip to start. It was good, nice chunks of spinach and artichokes, but it was extremely oily. It sits too heavy in my belly. This alone almost filled me up, so I can see someone making a meal out of just an appetizer.   I decided on the big rig pasta and my husband got the alfredo. The portions were so huge! But his was not that good. Sort of bland. I was expecting it to be a lot creamier and have a more spicy flavor. Mine was really good though. It wasn't too spicy, but I was expecting more of a kick, and it had a nice creamy sauce. Pretty much by the time our pasta was in front of us I was full from the dip so I ate a few bites and had it packed up to go. I definitely have lunches for the next two days. By this point we were both so full it hurt, so we ordered the pizza cookie to go so we could eat it at home. Which was the perfect amount of time to start digesting some food. In the 30 minutes it took to bake it, pay, drive back home, and get inside I was already ready to eat it. So we sat on the couch and devoured the entire thing in less than five minutes. Food baby number two of the night.  I really liked the food here. You get ginormous portions so you are more than likely always going to take food home. It wasn't too expensive. $35 for the two of us for one appetizer, two pastas, and desert. I think next time we will nix the appetizer and just go with dinner. But the pizza cookie is definitely worth getting at least once. I may not come back right away but I'll definitely be visiting again.

While driving down to PF Changs down by Fashion Square for a mothers day lunch, we passed by this place and decided on it instead to try something new. It looked busy outside on the patio so I figured this must be a pretty decent pizza place. I have only been to one other Fox restaurant and that is True Food Kitchen, which I like a lot. This place..... meh.  We walk in, and the first thing I notice to be different is its not a sit down, order, and food is brought to you kind of place. Its a order at the register, wait for food to come out kind of place. Which I was not expecting and frankly it confused me. The prices were extremely high for this kind of establishment. We ordered a few different items. The portabello and artichoke bruschetta, $4.50. Was it worth the money? No way. It was one thick slice of bread spread with a thin layer of goat cheese, topped with a minuscule amount of peppers, artichokes, and hardly any mushrooms. It did taste good, but definitely not a good value for the money. We also ordered the portabello and artichoke pizza $9.75, as well as the mushroom and arugula pizza, $9.75. I don't know where this place gets off charging the amount of money they do for how little food they give you. Their pizzas are a thin crust, with a thin layer of sauce, and a thin layer of cheese and toppings. Do people actually come here on a regular basis and pay this much for such a thin pizza? If they do something must be wrong with them. Either that or they are so dazzled by the Fox name that they don't care where they throw their cash. Now don't get me wrong. The pizzas all tasted really good, but I would not come here again because of the prices of the food here, which is the only reason for the two star review. I don't just review taste, I also review value. And the value here for what you get is none.   Also, places like this that don't pay their employees at least minimum wage really bother me. At the register you pay and they have a tip line. I don't usually tip at these kinds of places where all the service I get is food being brought out to me or if I do I don't tip the usual amount, but I was so flustered by this I had no idea what to do. I even asked the girl do people usually tip, and she told me they were tip based pay employees. Seriously? They don't do anything worth the tip. At that point I felt obligated to tip so I did. And I still feel like I shouldn't have. All in all I spent $34 dollars on about $5 worth of ingredients. I wont be back.

This is not anywhere close to authentic Italian gelato by any means, but for the price and the flavor of the gelato offered here, over the summer we pretty much made this place a regular stop after dinner.   Apparently there used to be 64 flavors out at one time, but now there are somewhere in the 30's area and a case for cakes. Frankly, I don't care that there aren't 64 flavors to choose from at one time. That would be overwhelming. There are generally enough choices to keep everyone happy.  Flavor wise, the fruit flavors leave a lot to be desired. They are more icy than ice-creamy. So I don't tend to get those much. The pistachio and chocolate amaretto are my two favorite flavors though. I go back to them the most. I have also enjoyed butterfinger, just because I love butterfingers. Most of the other flavors are good as well.  For the sizes available the price for gelato here is also a good deal. We get smalls for $3.15 each. One of the cheaper prices we have seen among all gelato shops. And you can mix flavors in your cups. Two flavors in small and medium, and up to three flavors in the large size.   We have had to stop coming in though just because we both gained some weight over the summer and we are both on a health kick, trying to lose the pounds. But I would come back here again eventually.

Right after I wrote my first review of this place, a groupon deal popped up that would let me try the pizza. I jumped right on it and used it today for lunch.   We came in about 3pm and it was pretty crowded. The pizza oven was going, and there were lots of people sitting around eating gelato. A lot more crowded than the last time we came in, that's for sure. We ordered lunch, I got the marinara pizza and my husband ordered the chopped salad. The wait time for our lunch was pretty minimal. A little over five minutes. My pizza came out first and it was pretty delicious. The crust was thin, with just the right amount of fluffy in the edges, and with a nice char on the bottom from the pizza oven. The sauce was tangy and had a nice array of spices in it. It was also covered in garlic and fresh basil leaves. I really enjoyed this pizza. My husbands salad was lettuce, chopped carrots, cucumbers, roasted corn, cherry tomatoes, parm, all in a very tasty vinaigrette on top of a piece of flat bread. His salad was also very delicious. Our coupon covered our whole meal plus two small scoops of gelato, but the prices of our lunches was pretty reasonable. I would come back here to eat the food again.  The gelato on the other hand, is still not my favorite. I had strawberry today and didn't finish it again. I don't know what it is about the gelato here, but I am just not crazy about it. Hence the four stars. The pizza and salads are great though. Come try those.

You know how sometimes people ask you if you have any hidden talents or if you have skills? Usually I would say none because I never had any. However, two months ago I took a learn to knit class at Tempe Yarn & Fiber and now I tell everyone that I can knit! I get excited when I talk about knitting and its something that I have always wanted to learn how to do.  Thanks to Groupon, I took a three hour learn to knit class where you are taught to cast on, knit, pearl, and bind off. They keep the classes small, around ten people, so that they can spend some time with everyone and make sure they can leave the class with the skills in hand to start some projects on your own. In the beginning it was a little hard getting used to the motions but I left there almost a knitting and pearling pro. Its been two months since I learned and I have a few projects going and I am getting a lot better at knitting. I actually have fun knitting! There are other classes available as well, and I might check them out in the future.   The yarns and needles in the store seem to be on par price and quality wise as a couple other yarn places I have checked out. They have a large selection of wool, acrylic, cotton, and other various types of yarn in this store, along with a large selection of needles in various sizes. When I came in I purchased a skein of acrylic yarn and some bamboo knitting needles. They have a frequent buyer card where every time you spend over $20 you get a stamp, and when you fill in the card you get 15% off your next total purchase.   The customer service is also excellent. All of the workers are willing to help out with questions about a project you are working on or the various supplies in the store. There is also a table in the front of the store where people can hang out and knit and talk all day long if you wish. It was full when I came in for my class so people obviously come and hang out here.   I will be returning here often!

The idea of Bookmans is great. Used books, movies, games, etc brought in by fellow book, movie, and game lovers so you can then purchase them at a lower price. Its the execution that needs a lot of work. I used to come in here a lot. And two years ago I probably would have rated it a lot higher than I am rating it today. I heard about this place from a family member and how you can bring in books you don't want anymore and get either store credit or cash. OMG! That is the best idea ever. Getting rid of something you don't want and then picking something out that you do! What a concept! I did this I think three or four times a few years back and was always happy with the return from books I had. I would check out the store while they were evaluating my selection and then come back with a handful of new books to buy after they told me what they would give me for mine.   The last time I came in here I brought in easily $100 worth of brand new cookbooks that I don't use anymore since becoming vegetarian. They were new cookbooks so I thought I was going to get a great deal. They wanted almost all of them, and then wanted to give me $4. Yes... $4. Umm... are these people on crack?!!? So I said, hell no and walked out with my books and then went and sold them on Amazon for almost $75.   The selection in this store is also really crappy. I looked at the cookbook section the last time I was in here, and I had never even heard of most of the books they had here. And trust me, I know what I am talking about. I am the girl you see in Barnes and Noble sitting in the cookbook section for four hours on the weekends. They were all old and tired and books obviously nobody wanted, which is why they were in this store.   I wont be coming back here.

I've had Grimaldi's saved in my bookmarks for awhile, and this Saturday I found an excuse to go. Family dinner night! I was in charge of figuring out where to eat and since we were all craving pizza and my mom was paying, I chose this place. By the end of the night, most of my family was a little ticked off at me for my choice.   I was super excited to try this place based on the reviews, and I am really sad that it did not live up to my expectations. I was literally expecting some of the best pizza I have ever had in my life. We come in around 7pm and its busy but we still manage to get a table right away. None of us order drinks because I think we all looked at the price of the pizza and figured this was going to be pretty expensive. We decided on two small pizzas: one half pepperoni (for my sister) and half mushroom, the other with the sweet roasted red peppers.   The service was a little strange. Our waiter didn't make eye contact all night. He looked at other tables, at his paper, or down at the floor when he talked to us. Was there something on our faces? I don't know, but it was really odd. The guy that delivered the pizzas to our table was nice though, and he served us all our first slice. I thought that was a nice touch. He was also very willing to get us new plates right away when the ones at our table were dirty.   The pizzas did not take long to come out, but I was a little surprised by them when they did. I literally couldn't tell the pepperoni or the red peppers from the sauce. The pepperonis were the tiniest I have ever seen. I didn't get any feedback from my sister or my husband on whether or not these were any good, so I am assuming they were either ok, or kind of boring. The mushrooms were flavorless and really thin. I think on my slice of pizza there were four mushrooms. Sad day, I love mushrooms. I am a little bit bothered by the fact that they still charge you $2 per topping even if you only get it on half of the pizza. Considering as well the toppings were tiny and hard to see. The red peppers were even more of a let down. $4 for that option as a topping. They were flavorless as well. And again, really sparse. The pizzas in general were really lacking in the flavor department. I tasted no specific spices, let alone no salt. The cheese was really bland as well. How can you have bland mozzarella? It seemed impossible to me.   So by the end of the meal my whole family was annoyed with me because we could have gone to any other pizza place and gotten 3 times as much pizza for half the price. Two small pizzas with essentially two (marginal) toppings cost $40. No drinks, no wine, no salad, no desert. My mom didn't say it, but she wasn't happy either, since she paid. Sorry mom, but don't worry I wont make that mistake again.

This place is ok. Defiantly better than places like Subway when talking about quality, but not so much better at quantity.   I have been here a few times. The first was a month or so ago after purchasing a groupon. They have a large selection of sandwiches, mostly meat and only two vegetarian options. This is great if you happen to be an omnivore. Which I am not. I can only say anything about the Madison Square Garden which I have had three times now. Their veggies seem to be of good quality. I just wish that every time I came in they were not out of wheat bread. I don't know if they just don't stock up on it or what but every time I have been in here they have been out of something. Cucumbers, wheat bread, avocado. And usually there is never any black tea. Some people like to ATTEMPT to eat healthy. There is also a lot left to be desired if you do order any of the other sandwiches on the menu. I went with my dad the last time who happens to eat meat, and there was more bread than meat. 10 dollars for a bread and cheese sandwich. Come on now. You have pictures all over the place of sandwiches full to the brim with meat and veggies, but then hand you a sandwich that you can't even see the meat on. FALSE ADVERTISING. So expect to pay a good amount of money if you order anything with meat on it, but not get your moneys worth.  The servers, if you can call them that, seem confused every time I come in here. They seem flustered, even though its the same people every time, and it has never been busy so I don't know what their excuse is. They don't seem to know the menu very well, or when something does happen to run out. They also close extremely early for a restaurant. 7 everyday except Sunday at 5. Seems strange. Maybe its because they can never keep enough food stocked to last longer than a few hours.  My conclusion: If you have a coupon or are a vegetarian where they put more veggies on your sandwich than anything else and you don't pay as much as you would for a meat sandwich, I would say go. But if you are looking for a good deal, you won't find it here.

My family stopped in here for dinner over the weekend. We had been once before a few years back, though I am not sure if it was before or after the Diners, Drive ins and Dives episode. We used to go to Joe's BBQ a lot and found out about Joe's Farm Grill through them. The first time we came in here I wasn't that impressed. I had gotten a burger (before I went vegetarian) and it was dry, bland, and boring. Nobody else remembers what they got that time either. So I decided we should give this place a second chance.   We showed up for dinner around 6:45 and there was already a line out the door and halfway to the street. I had read about the lines online before we came in here but didn't expect how long it was or how slow it moved. We didn't move for the first ten minutes we stood there, and then it took another thirty minutes to get through the rest of the line. I am a patient person, so I don't mind lines, but this one was a little ridiculous. There are only two cash registers, and once we had gotten far enough up the line to see them, one of them closed and left only one open. Seriously? There is a line out the door and they close a register? Why couldn't they get someone else to take over? Either way, we finally got up to the register and ordered our food. I got the portabello burger with garlic fries and a side of beet salad, my husband got the fontina burger with onion rings, mom got the ahi tuna burger with regular fries, and my niece ended up with grilled cheese and fries. We all got fountain drinks as well. All for a total of $52. A little on the expensive side for three adults and one child. The descriptions for the burgers tell you you get a choice of your favorite side, but of course what they don't tell you is they up-charge you if you get anything other than the regular fries. Which I didn't find out until after we had paid already. Very misleading.   While the line moved as slow as molasses, at least the food didn't take that long after being ordered. We waited less than 10 minutes to get our food. The only annoying thing about this was for some reason my nieces sandwich wasn't ready and we had to wait another five minutes for it to be done. I can make a grilled cheese at home in less time than that, and why it wasn't ready with the rest of the food makes no sense. Unless they gave away her sandwich to someone else or something. Eventually we all get our food and start to eat. My portabello burger was huge. The mushroom was at least twice the size of the bun, and it had lettuce and a green goddess dressing. I added the pickles that came on the side as well. It was a little on the salty side, but it was pretty tasty. My garlic fries were delicious. They weren't too spicy but there was an enormous amount of garlic. I love it! I smelled like garlic for two days afterwards. The beet salad however left a lot to be desired. The beets themselves were under seasoned and there wasn't nearly enough blue cheese. I could have also done without the pecans. They seemed out of place. My husband really liked his burger and his onion rings were really crispy and well seasoned. My mom said her ahi burger was also really good, however because of the way it was sliced, it kept falling out of the bun. Not the easiest sandwich to eat. My nieces grilled cheese was standard grilled cheese.   All of us really enjoyed our meal once we finally got to eat it. However the amount of time spent waiting in line made the experience a little less enjoyable. But my husband and I will probably come back here eventually, I just think we will have to plan the time better so we don't have to wait so long.

Came back this weekend after a trip to a farm festival in the area. I have gone vegan since my last review so here is a new update.  Vegans: Eating here is limited. All bread items, including pizza crust, contain dairy or eggs. The buns, I get it. But pizza crust? I don't understand why restaurants feel the need to add milk or eggs to the pizza dough. It doesn't add anything. And I was hoping to try the veggie pizza sans cheese, but no dice. The good thing about being a vegan and eating here is they have an allergen folder, that has the list of ingredients in all of their items. Which was nice. The girl who took our order was super sweet and gave me some options. Which basically includes all of the salads, without meat or cheese, and any of the vinaigrette dressing options.  I opted for the portabello farm salad which was a mixture of fresh veggies (beets, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, carrots, corn) on top of lettuce with a sliced portabello on top. I got the balsamic vinaigrette dressing. The good thing about the salads here is you can tell the veggies are really fresh. Everything tasted really good. But the salads are huge!! Which is good because they are expensive. My salad was $10 and I barely finished half of it. So I took it home to eat for lunch today. I also got the sweet potato fries with the pineapple and serrano dipping sauce. Those were also awesome. So you can eat here as a vegan, you choices are just limited. But the cashiers are willing to help find you options, which is nice.  Now for non vegans: My sister got the farm burger with mushrooms added and said it was the best burger shes ever had. My mom had the barbeque pork sandwich and loved that as well. My husband had the portabello burger. The food here is really good. All fresh and delicious.   Suggestions for Joe's: How about looking into some dairy/egg free bread and pizza crust options? Maybe some wheat bread options as well? I would love to come back here and have something other than a salad. Pretty please??

I'm on a diet, so I shouldn't have even been eating cupcakes. But I was stressed out, and Sprinkles was right across the street so I said "What the hell" and we walked over to grab a cupcake after lunch.   I'm vegan, so the only option that they have for vegans is red velvet. On the one hand I think its great they think of their vegan customer base because lets face it, vegans like baked goods too. On the other hand, only one flavor? Really? I wish they had a vegan strawberry or lemon or something. How hard could it be to come out with some new flavors? Anyways, so I order my cupcake and pay. $3.81 for my cupcake. Which should sound outrageous, but compared to what I have paid for other vegan cupcakes it was sort of a bargain.   I didn't feel like eating my cupcake in front of people, so I took it home. I sat down to eat it when I got home and the first thing I noticed was how oily it was. The paper was oily because the cake was so oily. I read in someone else's post that a red velvet cupcake has 497 calories, and if they make the vegan red velvet the same I can understand where all of the calories come from. Its the amount of oil. I don't think I have ever had such an oily piece of cake. So that was disappointing. But I already bought it so I ate it anyways. The frosting was nice. It tasted like coconuts, so I assume they use that coconut butter to make the frosting. I liked the frosting better than the cake. The cake wasn't dry, which I can assume was because of the large amount of oil in the cake, but it didn't have much flavor. And it wasn't very sweet either.   So that was a bust. I will just have to get my vegan cake fix elsewhere.

I only tried this service a few times, but in that short amount of time I realized quickly this was not for me. I heard about this from a coworker and was super excited to try this service. A random selection of fruits and vegetables and a low price of $15, and then an extra amount to go all organic (I think an extra $10 but its been awhile so I don't quite remember). We did one basket of non organic, and then two baskets of organic produce. We also tried a couple stuff packs and got some of the focaccia bread they offer.  The $15 deal seems like a better deal because you always end up with more produce than the organic basket, which is a shame. You are paying more, you should at least end up with the same amount of food. The two organic baskets I got were so very disappointing. Both times I ended up with pretty much the same produce of very green bananas (that sadly never turned yellow and had to be tossed), an abundance of apples, under ripe mangos, a small pineapple, broccoli, a small basket of tomatoes, a bag of romaine lettuce, some green bell peppers, and a sack of snap peas. And it seems like a good idea because you are eating whats given to you and you make the most out of what you get but that was never the case. Some of the stuff never got ripe, and some others molded within days. It is also nice to have variety which we seemed to not get.  The stuff packs were the best part of this program. I got an italian stuff pack and a mexican stuff pack and both were awesome. I wish I could just buy the stuff packs and not the rest of it. They are also a way better deal. $7.50 for each pack and you get a ton of produce in each one. The bread was ok. We only got to use one of the two provided loaves because it molded so fast. What a shame.   I always look at the pictures here and think "how come my baskets never looked like that?" Sadly, I will not be returning to this service.

Another groupon purchase. A few months back I saw this groupon and purchased it, and it wasn't until a few weeks ago that I had the chance to go. I have been really into vegetarian sushi lately so I was excited to try this place. And Meh... is appropriate for this place.   I came with my mom and husband on a Thursday night. The place wasn't busy at all and it was around 7pm. I think there were two other parties. When we walked in, the servers all looked at us. It took a few seconds of them staring at us for one to tell us to sit where we want, and then another few moments before anyone brought us menus. I had looked over the menu online before hand so I knew there were a few choices for me. I decided on the avocado rolls, vegan roll, and the tofu tofu roll. As far as the taste of them goes, they were all kind of bland. Even after dipping them in soy and wasabi. There were no sesame seeds on them which helps give them extra flavor. And the wasabi was unusually bland as well. I hardly got any spice from it at all. The most disappointing roll was the tofu tofu roll. It was different, deep fried tofu with green beans rolled inside of the tofu. So there was no rice in this roll. It was just ok. Again, really bland. They could have jazzed up the tofu or something. Everyone knows tofu needs love to taste good. Just tofu cut into blocks and deep fried isn't going to be very tasty.  My mom and husband got the Atkins roll and another one with yellow fin. They were also less than impressed with their selections.  One thing I noticed about this sushi place versus others I have been to, is the portion sizes are way smaller here. I ordered three rolls for me, which at any other sushi places stuffs me to the point where I feel like I am going to explode. Three rolls here, and I was still hungry. It made me sad. The only good thing this place has got going for it is the vegetarian rolls are all really cheap. Which is nice. The price of the fish rolls are all really expensive though. We had a $30 groupon and we still ended up paying an extra $15 on top of that because of how expensive the rolls were. Service here left a lot to be desired as well. The servers all stood around and talked with each other the whole time we were here. And we had to call to them for them to come over to the table. We probably wont be coming back here just because there are so many other sushi places in town better than this one.

This is hands down the best Whole Foods in Arizona. I have been to at least five, and this one is the best in terms of staff friendliness, and whenever I order a sandwich, they always have the ingredients that I want, which is pretty much why this place gets 5 stars.   The produce is always fresh looking and never looks like it was tossed off of a truck, like some locations I have been to. There is a juice and coffee bar that we always get fresh smoothies at. They are a good price for all of the fruit and veggies they throw in them. Bakery area where we can pick up some vegan baked goodies. The items in the store are always what I am looking for. I can't think of a time where I did not find what I was looking for, which is pretty amazing because since going vegetarian/vegan my list contains things I had never even heard of before. So it is pretty impressive to go to one store that has everything I want, and this locations is a lot bigger than most. There are also at least five places you can grab some take out. Pizza, sandwiches, mexican, a noodle place, and a grill along with a hot and cold salad bar. We have gotten pizzas before. They are big, but they can get pretty pricy depending on what toppings you get. It is probably a better deal to buy the premade specials by the pound. We love the sandwiches here. And I have to say, they almost always have focaccia. Which I can't say for every other Whole Foods I have tried to buy sandwiches at. They also have a very large bakery area, chocolates, and gelato sections. All good.   The staff are pretty friendly. At first they all just seemed like they hated their job, but the more we came here the more they warmed up. And most of them recognize us now. It may cost you more to shop at Whole Foods, but its definitely worth the extra money.

So coincidentally, I decided to give this place another try after I wrote this review, and I can't say that I will be back. I am changing my review from 3 stars to 1 just because of the ridiculousness that was my sandwich. I asked for no cheese, add avocado. Simple right? Apparently not because about 80 percent of the time I have asked for avocado (and it costs an extra 75 cents mind you) I haven't received it. You think I would just learn and stop asking for it, but I tried again. This time they gave me cheese and no avocado. Apparently this is the hardest thing this place has to do because they can NEVER get it right. And this time they actually added something I specifically said not to. So eff you Spicy Pickle. I am breaking up with you.   5/1/11  ----------------------------------------------------------  Working in an office is sort of like searching through yelp. Your coworkers bring in lunch from random lunch places you didn't know existed, and then you file them away in your bookmark section of your brain to try later and review. Spicy Pickle is one of those places I had no idea existed. I moved to this area of town almost two years ago and I am still finding new places to try. Its like a food expedition every time I go out. I had seen one of my coworkers bring in Spicy Pickle about four times before I decided to try it late last year. I have been here at least seven or eight times by now, but lately I just have not been that impressed.  When I first came to spicy pickle I was excited about another sandwich place to try. You see, I love sandwiches. You give me two pieces of bread with any combination of dressings, mayos, and veggies in between them and I am one happy girl. I don't know if the excitement got to me or what but for at least a month after I found this place I was in here every week at least. Its right down the street from my work as well so that made it super convenient. I have only had the Bastille sandwich, but of course I customize it to my tastes. I skip the cheese, sub sun dried tomato mayo for basil mayo, and add avocado. It was pretty tasty. But then I don't know what happened. Maybe I ate it so much I got sick of it, or maybe I just realized it was only a sub par sandwich, but I fell out of love with Spicy Pickle. Every time my husband wants to come here now I make a face. Maybe its because they added on a side with every sandwich as well as raising their prices. I'd rather have no side and less expensive sandwiches, thanks.   BUT! There is one thing I continue to love about Spicy Pickle, and you guessed it. Its the pickles. They are so spicy and crunchy and I love that. I have a hard time finding a spicy pickle at the store that I like. Maybe I need to learn to make my own. But anyways. It has been a few months now since I have been here and I haven't had a craving to return. Perhaps one day I will. But for now I will continue to think about their pickles and wish I could just buy them by the jarful.

I have been saving my 100th review for my favorite restaurant of all time.   We found Thai Basil over a year ago now and have been loyal customers, going at least once a week and sometimes more than that, since last July. Everyone who works here is super friendly, and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart. We just walk in now and they see us and say "Spicy noodle, tofu, hot, right?" Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order. I have tried most of the menu items. The garlic eggplant is also pretty great. The thai basil is also amazing. I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry. I never have had a good curry experience. Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it (which they quickly replaced with a new order) but I just wasn't a fan. Maybe it's because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet.   The spring rolls are also the best here out of every spring roll I have had anywhere.   Before I went vegan again last year we also got the fried banana ice cream pretty often. That is pretty amazing. If you eat dairy, you have to try it at least once.   Thai Basil is one of our regular spots to eat out, and we hope its here to stay for many more years to come. I don't know what I would do without my spicy noodles!!!

I used to bowl a lot as a kid. I had lots of parties at bowling allies, I hung out with my cousins at the bowling alley, and I had father/daughter time at the bowling alley. I was never good at it, but it was always a good time. The thing I used to hate though, was the fact that you were allowed to smoke in the bowling alley. GROSS! Needless to say, its obviously been a long time since I've been bowling because when I walked in today it was like a breath of fresh air. No smoking!   Aside from that, bowling is a good time, even if I am still no good at it. I purchased a few groupons and finally got around to using them. I went with my husband, sister and three year old niece. We all had fun. We played two games each and by the end we were all saying how much we wanted to come back already. And another cool thing, we got there at 3pm on a Saturday, and they had just started cosmic bowling during the day. It was pretty cool because I would never come in to bowl late enough for the actual cosmic bowling.   The people around you are going to be annoying and there might even be some obnoxious dad yelling at his under ten year old children about how to properly spin the ball, but there is always a group of crazy people at the bowling alley. Its part of the fun. My suggestion though, don't eat the food. It's over priced and greasy. I never eat any of it but I always think its funny when people complain about it. You know its going to be gross and overpriced, so why do you get it? Come for the bowling. The people that work there are even willing to hand you coupons they have in their pockets. Which would have been nice if we didn't already have groupons.

I give these guys major props for having vegan gelato that actually tastes really good. I knew about this place before, but didn't check it out until I purchased a deal on living social. And I am so glad I did!   Went in for the first time last week. They had two flavors of vegan gelato, six flavors of sorbet (which is also non dairy) and I think they had one or two flavors of vegan soft serve, among other dairy based flavors of gelato and soft serve. I opted for both flavors of the vegan gelato. The guy working the counter was really nice. He told us they rotate the flavors about once a month, so they always have something different. The flavors I got this day were pistachio and amaretto chocolate. Both were really good. And I have had REAL gelato before. Like the kind in Italy. And these were just as good. I wont say better because nothing beats Italian gelato, but these were definitely the best vegan gelato I have ever had. I went back a couple of days later and they had a third flavor of gelato out, spicy chocolate. It was definitely spicy. There is no way I could ever eat an entire cup of it. But it was good for a couple bites. I am excited to go back in a few weeks to see what new flavors they have.

I am going to update my review since the owner sent me a nice little message and explained the reason for the microwaves. I totally respect the amount of work she puts into her food everyday, and I really appreciated that she took the time to explain all of her cooking processes and limitations in her kitchen. I also appreciate how kind she was about it. I have seen posts from owners from other restaurants bashing customers for having an opinon. Its refreshing to see an owner who does the exact opposite. Knowing now that the microwaves are used only to boil water I feel better knowing that what I ate was not cooked in the microwave. I will definaly be back to try out all of your other breakfast dishes!     4/26/11  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I came in here really wanting to love this place. I am always looking for more vegan places to eat because my ultimate goal is to go completely vegan sometime in the near future. We came in at around 8:30 on Saturday morning. That is one thing I have to say about their Saturday hours. Everywhere except their Facebook page says they open at 11 on Saturdays, and even the sign outside of the store says they open at 11, but they actually open at 8 on Saturdays. We might have been the first people in there because of this. And nobody came in after us until about 9:15. Maybe people are confused about the hours? I don't know. But from the reviews on this place I expected it to be jumping. I know every time I go to Pomegranate Cafe this early its packed. So maybe update your website and sign out front? Just a suggestion.   Anyways, so we walked in and ordered. I got the vegan eggs benedict, and my husband got the tofu scramble and one of the smoothies. So we sit down and wait for our food to come out. Now I don't want to be picky, but this is one of the things I notice when I walk into a place. Its small, yes. That doesn't bother me. It just didn't feel clean to me. Most of the tables had stuff all over them and weren't cleaned right. There was dust all over everything. And a giant dead mosquito watched me pretty much my entire breakfast from the window where he was caught in a spiders web. For a place this size, there really shouldn't be any reason why it was a dirty as it was. Maybe that doesn't bother some people, but I was put off by all of the dust.   The other thing I noticed that really bugged me, is how many times I heard them open and close the microwave. Aren't restaurants supposed to use pots and pans? I don't think I heard the sound of a pot clanging one time. And I have stopped going to restaurants in the past because I found out they use microwaves. If I want to use a microwave, I'll go home and cook myself. I didn't come here to pay ten dollars for breakfast, for it to be made entirely in the microwave. Honestly, I would rather wait an hour for breakfast so it can be made on the stove, than to have it done in ten minutes out of a microwave.   So after about 15 to 20 minutes our food comes out. It is a lot more than I thought it was going to be. I had two pieces of toast with four pieces of tofu bacon, then topped with two tofu "eggs" with avocado and garlic aoli. It was served with a salad and fresh fruit. The salad was a little odd for breakfast, but it tasted good. I liked the dressing and sunflower seeds. I really liked the eggs benedict. It had a good flavor and even for as much food as it was I ate everything on my plate. My husband also liked his scrambled tofu which came with toast and jam, fresh fruit and two pieces of tofu bacon. For ten dollars you really do get what you pay for.   I really want to come back here because I did like the food, however I don't know that I will knowing how much they do use the microwave. Maybe some people don't care about that, but I do. Perhaps, I will just have to come back and try their raw options. But really, get rid of the microwave!

Why yes, I did go back the next night to have some more delicious food at Gallo Blanco. Before the play my family and myself were all going to attend, I convinced my mom to take us to Gallo Blanco after raving about it to her the night before. We had so much food again! The beans, which are vegetarian, are amazing. I could have eaten an entire bowl of them. I also had the prickly pear margarita. I liked it, but I don't know if it was worth the $10 I paid for it. I couldn't even taste the alcohol. We also got an order of the Chiccharon that was ok, but didn't get finished. For dessert we ordered the tres leches cake, so good, and the brownie cake, which actually tasted store bought. It wasn't warm and just had that packaged flavor. I don't know if it was or not but no one at the table liked it that much.   However, tacos had by all were amazing of course. Veggie, fish, shrimp, and steak were had at the table. My husband and sister loved the shrimp and I was told the steak was good as well.   I can't wait to come back here again.       5/7/11.  ----------------------------------------  OMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOM  Ya, those are pretty much the sounds I made while I was eating my meal at Gallo Blanco today. After fantasizing about this place for weeks we finally found a reason to go, Cinco de Mayo!, and headed down there for happy hour today. We showed up at about 4:30 and there were only three other tables taken. It got super packed about 10 minutes later so we showed up just in time. Service was super speedy. We never had an issue the entire meal where it was taking too long. My only complaint about service was the water glasses were way too small and the poor waitress had to come over pretty much every five minutes to refill them. It might be time for some larger water glasses. We tend to be heavy (water) drinkers.   We ordered the guacamole to start. I liked it, but I have to say I tend to favor a more spicy guacamole than one with citrus in it. But it was different, and I would order it again. For dinner I ordered three veggie tacos ($1 each during happy hour!! OMG!!) and my husband ordered two fish tacos, and the fish happened to be halibut today which my husband loves, and one veggie taco. The tacos are great. They are small but they filled us both up super fast. We left here totally full and moaning about how much we had eaten. The veggie tacos had a bunch of different veggies in them topped with more guacamole. The fish tacos looked to be about the same. I also ordered the Elote. It was delicious but I probably wont order it again seeing as how it was $5 for one corncob. If they lowered it to $3 I would probably order it every time I come in. We thought about getting dessert but decided we were way too full to try. Saving that experience for another day.   The happy hour prices here are amazing. We ordered guacamole, one Elote, and six tacos. All under $20. That's a crazy good deal. Seeing as how good of a deal it is during happy hour I will probably never come here any other time except happy hour. I want to go back right now even though I am still full. I keep thinking about those tacos....

We decided on this place a couple of days ago for dinner. Its nice they stay open til 10pm. Most sandwich places have long closed by then. We have eaten here once before this and it was about the same experience. It was just ok.   My husband ordered the vegetarian wrapini without the cheese. He is a big eater and this was pretty small. I ended up sharing some of my sandwich with him. I ordered a half vegetarian muffaletta without the cheese. I watched while they "made" this. They took a pre-made sandwich out of the fridge, unwrapped the plastic, then removed the cheese, put it on a conveyer belt to warm the bread, and stuck it in a to go container. I was slightly bothered by this. The place wasn't busy, so why couldn't they make my sandwich fresh? I don't know how many other of the sandwiches on the menu are pre-made like this. i am guessing a large number of them. The sandwiches tasted ok. The veggies were pretty fresh so as far as I could tell they were probably made that morning. Every sandwich comes with chips and a pickle, which is nice. You don't have to pay extra for them like most places. Granted, you don't get a choice of chips.    All in all our total for two sandwiches with chips and pickles and two drinks was under $20. Its a good deal if you don't have any other options available to you.

I had one of the worst experiences of my vegetarian life here. I had been to Johnny Rocket's before and gotten the vegan option so I knew I would be ok going here. I was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so I figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want.   We get in and I ordered a burger that wasn't the Streamliner (1st mistake), and just ordered it with the BOCA burger. The waitress takes our order, my husband also ordered his with a BOCA.   About 20 minutes later the food comes out. The patty looks right. I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day, but I ignored it. It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty (over a year), so I THOUGHT it looked right. (2nd mistake)  I start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table. It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there. So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution. I immediately start to freak out. We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA, why does it say Turkey? She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey. I say, no that doesn't sound right. So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again. The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened. I'm upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey? I mean, really. I know some people might think how did I not know the difference. And I thought that to myself as well, but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn't have. And it hurts me every time I think about it. I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again, if any of them ever again because of this experience.   All I can say is, if you are vegan or vegetarian, and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets, make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a BOCA burger isn't meat. Stress that to them. Because obviously they aren't trained to know what the difference is.

While never understanding the whole cake pop and cupcake trend that seems to be growing, I do enjoy a cupcake on occasion. They are a nice treat in a small package. Mind Over Batter seems to have perfected the cupcake. I knew about this place before because I used to work with one of the owners at a previous job, but did not decide to check it out until I purchased a groupon.  I think between my husband and I we have tried at least eight different flavors of cupcakes and all have been very good. My favorite flavors are the Pink Cadillac which is a strawberry cupcake with a buttercream frosting. So delicious and moist. I am a sucker for a strawberry cupcake anyways and this one is amazing. I could eat these everyday. The frosting is a little heavy for my taste just because of how sugary frosting tends to be. I could do with about half the amount of frosting that is put on each cupcake but it does taste really good. The toasted coconut cupcake is also one of my favorites. Super moist white cake with frosting and toasted coconut flakes on top. I am practically drooling thinking about it. My husbands favorites are the Reese with a spoon which is a chocolate cupcake with a peanut butter frosting and chocolate peanut butter candies on top. He also enjoys the red velvet cupcake. I have had a few of the others but do not like them as much as the strawberry and coconut. I am not a fan of the chocolate chips in the chocolate cake batter, but that's just me.   I think the price for each cupcake is fair just going off of what some other bakeries charge per cupcake. It is under $3 per cupcake and I think less than $2.50 per cake pop, which are also fun, but the frosting is way too sweet for me on these. I have only tried these once.   I am all for supporting a local business and the owners of Mind Over Batter are great people. I wish I could come here more often but my recent consumption of too many cupcakes left me with pants that are too tight!! I will have to come back once I have lost a few pounds to try the lemon cupcake, which also looks amazing!

I have been a member of this gym for about three months now, and while it may not be the fanciest gym I have ever been to, it serves the purpose it was designed for. To give you the best workout you can give yourself.  The cardio machines are all decent. Some of them don't work all of the time, but there are a large enough number of them that this usually isn't a problem. You can just hop on the one next to it. There are all of the usual machines: treadmills, ellipticals, stair masters, bikes, etc. Depending on what time of the day I come I usually don't have an issue finding a vacant machine.  There are a large variety of weight training machines that my husband mostly uses. Free weights as well. I don't use them as much but my husband is satisfied by them. There are also a number of different ab machines that I use from time to time. I like those the most.   The locker rooms are pretty bare but I only ever use the lockers. You have to bring your own locks. They also lead right into the pool area so you don't have to go walking around the gym in your bathing suit which is nice.   I mostly joined this gym because I wanted to have access to the pool. It is a standard lap pool with three lanes. I like that there are hardly ever any people in it, no matter what time we come here. There is also a sauna and a steam room in this area along with a whirlpool. I always see a lot of people using these, and I have been in them as well on occasion.   The staff are all friendly but there always seems to be somebody different at the front desk every time we come in.   The most crowded times of the day to come are between 4 and 7 PM. After that there are hardly any people in here, which is when I like to come. But even when its busy people don't bother you. I never feel like I'm being watched in this gym like I have in other gyms I have been to.   I am satisfied with the services this gym has for me, and I can see myself being a member for a long time.

I have a serious Banana Republic problem. Rewind time to about three years ago when I bought my first dress from BR. I had just gotten my first full time "real job" after finishing college and I needed a wardrobe to match my new position. It is now three years later and I have probably close to twenty dresses from BR. The only issue I have is they leave me pretty darn broke, so when I heard BR had a factory store I was stoked! So last weekend I dragged my husband, sister and niece down to Anthem to check this place out.  It was crowded, but the prices of the items definitely make up for it. That is, when you find something worth buying. The selection of items is a little weird, and you have to fight with many other women to get into the racks with the good stuff. But I managed to find two 100% cotton dresses that are both casual and work appropriate at the same time. Priced originally at $80 with a markdown to $40 on the rack, they also had a 25% off sale on these particular items that day. So I scored two dresses originally totaled for $160 for $60. Sounds like a good deal to me. I wish they had more colors, except that would have been bad for my credit card cause I am sure I would have ended up buying them all. My husband also scored two pairs of jeans, two cotton shirts, and three pairs of boxers for under $100.   I can see myself making the 50 minute drive down here at least four times a year to see what new stuff comes in. My dress collection is going to get larger this year, I can tell you that. Also, if you sign up online for the factory store you can get coupons for extra % off your total purchase. So your super discounted items just got even more discounted.

I gave Enzo's a second chance today after dinner as I haven't been since I wrote my first review. Boy am I ever glad I did!   I tried their dairy free fruit flavors today. Let me tell you. The cantaloupe and the watermelon are simply amazing. So many times I have had dairy free gelato and it just tastes like ice. Not here. They are creamy and dreamy, fruity and delicious. Their prices are also crazy cheap, and the staff is super friendly.   I'm totally ditching the other place I usually get dairy free gelato at and coming to Enzo's anytime I need a gelato fix. YUM!

I feel very torn about this place. I went twice and both times were lackluster.   I want to give 1 star to the parking situation at this location. Its always full and an accident waiting to happen because it dead ends and you have to back up into oncoming traffic trying to find a parking spot as well. The two times we came here, we ended up parking in a barber shop lot across the street. You would think with this corner of shops parking would have been worked out better. Don't come and expect to find parking, ever. I know its not the gelato stores fault for bad parking, but it seriously deters any desire to come here and it just makes it frustrating.  I want to give 5 stars for the vegan flavors of gelato. I had pear and banana and they were really good. Some of the best vegan fruit flavored gelato I have ever had.   I want to give 2 stars to the regular flavors of gelato. They just tasted like milk and melted really fast. I tried pistachio and chocolate.   I want to give 1 star to the scoop size. I swear to god, my scoop was slightly bigger than a golf ball. And for $3? Are you kidding? Without the groupon I purchased which was $5 for $10 worth of gelato, neither time we used the full amount, I don't see myself frequenting this place as the amount is crazy.  I want to give 1 star to the workers who helped us both of the times we came in here. No joke, I told them which flavor I wanted and they asked "which one is it? Point it out." Uhh... isn't that your job to know? Its not like there were 50 flavors to choose from. I think I counted 18. So it shouldn't have been that complicated.  I am going to settle on 2 stars since that's what my total averaged out to be. I don't see myself coming back here for all of these reasons except the fruit flavored gelatos, which I wish were given bigger scoops or the prices were changed. But even for how good they are, I can't say I'll be back. Sorry.

I love Chipotle! I have always been a fan, and even more so since becoming a vegetarian. I love that their rice, tortillas, black beans, fajita veggies, salsa's and guacamole are all vegan! I love the corn salsa the best and usually ask for two scoops on my burrito. And large globs of guacamole. That stuff is super addicting.   So everyone knows that Chipotle is great, but this review is based more so on this particular location. This is the location I like the best. The workers are super friendly. One of them I swear is even in love with my husband because she always gives him more guacamole than she gives me. But the staff is great. If they are ever almost out of guacamole or fajita veggies they ask us to wait for fresh stuff to come out instead of giving us the old brown stuff at the bottom of the bowl. I love them! There is a Chipotle closer to our house than this location, but we come out to this one every time just because of the staff. That, and the quality of the food seems to be better at this one. Ive been to Chipotles where the beans have been mushy and bland, but the food is always fresh and great at this location.   Chipotle is great, but this location is the best by far in terms of staff friendliness and freshness of food.

Pop quiz hot shot: How do you take an already healthy vegetarian taco/burrito/bowl and make it more healthy?  Get the new brown rice offering! Went in today for lunch and was super excited to see that they now offer brown rice. Hells yeah! Now if only Chipotle would jump on the whole wheat tacos and tortillas it would be perfect. Hopefully one day...

Here is a common scene at my house:   I just worked a long day at my desk in front of my computer. I come home to read and relax and end up falling asleep until 10pm after all of the restaurants around us have already closed. I'm starving and exhausted and I don't want to cook. So what are my husband and I to do about dinner? In-N-Out seems to be the perfect solution. For under $12 we can get two grilled cheeses with grilled onions, two fries, and two extra large iced teas. And when they say extra large, they mean it. I got one of those for the first time last week because its only .40 cents more than the medium and good lord that thing was large. It took me two days to drink all of the tea in it. Occasionally when I am feeling extra unhealthy I will get a chocolate shake to dunk my crispy, hot, salty fries in. What? You think that's gross? Well, its not. You should try it sometime. Its amazing. I still have yet to try the animal style grilled cheese. I hear they exist.   We end up coming here probably once a week because its cheap and fast and I don't mind eating unhealthy once in awhile. I work out. So its all good.

A couple of months ago my husbands feet started to hurt around his heel to where it was so painful they hurt right as he got up in the morning. We researched foot doctors in our area to go to and picked Dr. Robert T Evans from this facility. My husbands first appointment was two weeks ago, and we had a second appointment today.  The first thing I noticed about this place was this has got to be the best run doctors office I have ever been to. Both of our appointments were on time and even though there were also other patients being treated at the same time, he was thorough with my husband and at no point did we feel rushed to get through our appointment. At his first appointment the doctor was quick to diagnose my husbands foot problem and to offer solutions. He offered a quick fix for his painful heels before we could get back in and get some custom orthotics made, which is what he did at the second appointment. They did xrays, ultra sounds, and a thorough examination of my husbands feet on the first appointment. Today a second ultra sound was done to assess his healing progress.  Dr Evans is a very kind doctor who actually cares about his patients and not just a paycheck. Every other doctor in the area needs to take lessons from him on how to run an efficient office. We are both very glad to have found this doctor. I would recommend him to anyone who has any kind of foot problem.

I found out about this place after the Sapna Cafe in Phoenix closed and the chef there came to work here. I am a vegetarian and am always on the lookout for restaurants that serve vegan options because I am always striving to eat more vegan than vegetarian. On top of that, finding a place I can get breakfast at has been a challenge. I was super excited to find out there was a place just like that near my house.   I have been here a few times now. Three times for breakfast, and once for lunch. I will say, I LOVE their breakfasts. The vegan in season scramble is SO good. I love the bread they use for toast and the tofu is a really great flavor and texture. They also had a special once that was like a vegan version of huevos rancheros. So good. Soy chorizo, black beans, scrambled tofu. I wish they had that all of the time. The one time I had lunch here I was not too crazy about it. They were out of the thing I originally wanted, which sucked, so I ended up getting a burger. A little over priced if you ask me. For me and my husband we spent almost 30 bucks on two lunches, and no drinks. I understand organic costs more, but seriously. A lot of their food is way overpriced. My mom had a french toast special here once that was two slices of skinny french toast, a few blueberries, and some soy whip. 9 bucks. There was more food on my 8.5 dollar scramble plate than her 9 dollar french toast. Somebody needs to do some readjusting with the prices and they would probably end up making more money because I would come in here a hell of a lot more if it was more reasonable.   All in all, really good healthy food, vegan and vegetarian, but the prices are way too steep for us to become regulars. I would love to, but its just not in the budget.

One of my favorite places to grab a quick lunch. My husband and I have been a few times and we usually always get the same thing but its always delicious.  I love the falafel sandwich. Its always made fresh to order so its always hot and crispy. Comes with lettuce, onion, and tomato. It also comes with a side of tahini sauce you can drizzle on. I always like to cover it in hot sauce too. Makes it taste so good. I tend to use my own hot sauce though because the hot sauce here is a weird bright red almost pink color and really watery. Not much spice there either. So I just use my chalula at home. My husband usually gets the vegetable pita which he likes as well.   The vegetarian options are really cheap as well. Even if we get the meal deals where you can add on fries, soup, or salad and a drink we always leave here paying less than $15. Less than $10 if we don't get the deal. So for vegetarians its a great deal.   The customer service is also really great. The shop is run by some really friendly people who are always willing to cater to my weird requests. We also had one weird time here as well where the credit card machine wasn't working and for 10 minutes we all tried to run the card until I finally decided to just walk across the street and get some cash. It was weird, but funny. But it looks like they got the credit card machine situation worked out because the couple of times we have been in since then it has worked fine.

Want to know a secret on how to waste nearly $50 in less than an hour? Come to RigaTony's! My husband and I live right down the street from here and watched as it was being built wondering what it would be. When we found out it was a RigaTony's I became disinterested. I have never eaten here and had no desire to, that is until my husband decided he wanted to try it. He knew it was an italian place and he likes to find new places where he can eat a bowl of pasta. I stalled going here as long as possible but Friday night I finally gave in and we went to dinner here. I think we came in around 6, which I guess is right before the dinner rush because there was no wait, but when we left less than an hour later there was a line out the door. And thank god we didn't have to wait because the people who line up to eat here are total fools.  The service was quick and our waitress was really friendly. That is the only reason this place gets more than 1 star. She was quick to bring us water and take our order. We decided on the portabello cloud as an appetizer, which sounded interesting. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and my husband ordered some seafood with pasta and cream sauce special that was being offered. Salad and bread comes with the meal and luckily I had read before hand that the salad comes with salami so I requested the salad without it. The only way that I can really describe this place is a lower quality Olive Garden. And I hate Olive Garden. The salad is basically the same with lettuce, red onions, tomato, black olives, and peppers, but instead of a decent italian dressing that I can stomach, this one is coated with cheese and a heavy dressing. I barely finished one serving, but I watched as the table across from me (two women and one child) devoured two bowls of it. Ugh. The bread was just ok. Its just bread. Our appetizer comes out and it was not what I was expecting. It was a portabello mushroom filled with cheese and a few smigens of tomato and spinach, deep fried and placed on top of a pool of basil cream sauce. If you don't care about fitting into your pants the next morning, this could be tasty.   Our entrees were the same. Low quality Olive Garden fare. My $12 fettuccine was an embarrassment to the name. I make amazing fettuccine for less than $12 that can feed four people!! Do people actually come here and eat this garbage when you can make so much better at home?? And apparently there is flour in the sauce to make it thicker. Not necessary and made me lose my appetite quite frankly. My husband liked his meal at the restaurant but started to feel sick as we were leaving and we took our leftovers home but they ended up in the dumpster on the way into our house because we couldn't stomach the thought of eating this food again. When we got the bill and our total came to $40 I about passed out. I had to leave the tip in cash because I couldn't stomach the thought of adding more to our credit card. What a complete waste of money. The food was bad. Bad bad bad. Heavy, greasy, everything was covered in cheese or some kind of cream sauce. I hope this experience made my husband realize that food can be so much better. I hardly ate the next day just to counteract the amount of calories I ingested in this meal.  One more note. I know this is a "family restaurant", but seriously. If your newborn baby is screaming its head off and the restaurant is full of people, please take the baby outside until it calms down. Its just downright rude when you let the kid scream in a place full of people who didn't come there to listen to your baby scream.

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Even reading the good reviews I was expecting greasy fry bread. I have not had too much experience with fry bread, and my husband had never had it until today. We went with my mom and used a groupon I had purchased a few months back that was getting ready to expire.   My husband and myself ordered the bean and cheese fry bread taco (the beans are vegetarian), and my mom ordered the red chili and cheese taco. I really liked the bean and cheese taco. Thick, fluffy fry bread topped with mashed beans and cheese. There was not too much cheese and a good amount of beans. It was hot and delicious. There was some hot sauce on the table that I tried as well and it gave the taco a nice kick to go along with the delicious beans. I came in pretty hungry and it filled me right up. The prices are great too. $4.25 for bean and cheese, and $5.25 for the chili and cheese, which my mom also liked. She said this was probably the best fry bread she had ever had. The prices for water and sodas are also really cheap. I was surprised by that. For three tacos and three drinks our total came out to $18 bucks. For a three person lunch that is really reasonable.   I was all prepared to give this place four stars, when who I am guessing was the owners daughter comes out and gives us a complimentary plate of desert fry bread. It had a section of different desert fry bread combinations. Powdered sugar, honey, caramel, and cinnamon sugar. I thought that was a nice touch, and every other table received one as well. Really nice people. So this place definitely deserves five stars.   Good food, good prices, and good people. What more can you ask for for lunch? You will be seeing us again soon.

I don't like to give places a 1 star review unless I have either gotten sick or had a really bad experience. I sort of had a combination of the two at China Magic Noodle House. I saw a groupon for this restaurant a couple days ago and it looked simple and good so I went ahead and bought it. I am always in the mood for noodles so I was excited to try this place, and it was right down the street from my house. So Sunday afternoon we decided to eat here for lunch. I have been sitting on this experience for two days now and I feel that I am not giving a harsh review based on my experience.   We walk in around 3pm and there were only a few tables being served. The first thing that hits me is the smell of this place. My first thought was that it smelled like urine. I'm sure it was just a combination of the spices and whatever was being made in the kitchen, but it was not a mouth watering smell like you should experience when you walk into a restaurant. I should have turned right around and went home, but we stayed. So we sit down and someone brings over some water and some boiled peanuts and pickled vegetables. I still am not sure if this was supposed to be some kind of appetizer or a garnish for the noodles. It was a little weird. So I decided on the spicy vegetarian noodle dish, and my husband decides on the vegetables and fried noodle dish and a strawberry smoothie. I see that there are spring rolls on the menu as well. There is a language barrier here with the waiters so when I asked if the spring rolls were vegetarian at first she just thought I was ordering them, but after asking three times whether or not they were vegetarian I think she finally understood what I was asking. So I was a little bit concerned about these.   Everything came out really fast. Like around 5 minutes fast. The spring rolls were vegetarian, but they tasted like they came out of a freezer bag. And the vegetables inside were really limp and not crisp at all. A couple packets of mustard and some gelatin like duck sauce come with the rolls. I didn't use either. How hard would it be to make a really simple nice sauce for the rolls? My noodles come out first and at first they look really good and I was excited. However as I am eating them I am noticing some weird textures in the supposedly vegetarian sauce. It tasted almost like some kind of seafood and it was gritty. I didn't finish it and when I asked two different waitresses what was in the sauce, neither of them could tell me. Which is concerning. I can't feel good going back to a place that can't tell me whats in the vegetarian sauce. My husband liked his noodles, but he isn't as paranoid about what his food is made out of as I am. His smoothie tasted like a slushie you get at 7-11. I am sure it was made with some kind of red dye and not fresh strawberries. Sickeningly sweet as well.   About an hour later we are walking around Target and my stomach starts to burn. I feel this intense burning sensation in my stomach for the next two days. I think there is some kind of issue with MSG here possibly. I don't know what else could have made me feel like that. I also didn't eat pretty much anything for the next two days because of how bad my stomach felt.   The only cool thing about this place is the guy who pulls noodles in the big window in the middle of the restaurant. Prices are also pretty cheap. Its cash preferred as well. Other than that, I am sorry to say I won't be back.

Of the yogurt places I have tried this summer, this one was probably my least favorite. I live right down the street from here and have been here twice. I don't have any desire to return.   No sample cups, no indication of what ingredients are in which flavors, and the topping bar is just ok. The only flavor I really remember is the strawberry and all I can recall about it is how much I disliked it.   Another thing I don't quite understand is why these kinds of places are so expensive. I feel like I can get double the amount of ice cream anywhere else and pay half as much. Both times we came in here it cost us at least $10. That just seems crazy! And we didn't even have that much in our cups.

What a nice cool little treat. I found this gem on groupon and so glad I did.   Fresh fruit paletas made by hand. Ive had a few flavors and I have loved them all. Lemon is nice and tart with a lemon sugar sprinkle, mexican hot chocolate tastes chocolaty and amazing, mango has chunks of the mango in it and you can tell its fresh fruit because it still has that stringy texture fresh mango has. My husband's favorite flavor is the one with nuts. Its not too sweet and delicious. I love the cute little bite in the corner too. Its just a fun little thing.  Prices are pretty good too. Less than $3 for each paleta. Its nice to have a place like this in the summer you can go off to, and they are open pretty late on the weekends. Its nice when they have the art stuff going on in downtown Chandler you can grab a paleta and walk around the area and check out all of the art. Just one thing. Its cash only! So make sure you bring a $10 and you are good to go.

After lunch today we decided to stop in at Fleur de Teas. We had a groupon for this place and my husband has this obsession with tea lately, so I figured this would be the best place to spend a little while to make him happy. I think this tea store is superior to other tea stores in the valley based on one thing. They don't hound you or pressure you into buying tea. We have been to Teavana a few times before just to check it out, and the one time we asked about the kinds of tea they had I felt like I was going to be kidnapped and dragged into an abandoned building and beaten if I didn't buy any tea. They were aggressive and pushy and made you feel obligated to buy something after they pulled down their heavy containers of tea.   This place is totally different. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing. You can check out the store at your own pace without any pressure from the workers. All of the tea comes in bags, but each tea is available to smell from these little cups that are placed by each kind of tea. There must be at least 100 different types of teas here. My husband talked with the lady who worked there for awhile about which kinds of teas tasted like what and he decided on three. A green, a white, and a chocolate tea. I'm not much of a tea drinker unless its black iced tea with no sugar, but I am excited to try the chocolate tea. My husband also picked up a porcelain tea pot here as well. There were all kinds of pots and strainers to choose from and I had fun wandering the store. It might take us awhile to get through all three bags of tea, but when we do we will definitely be back to try out some new flavors.

I ended up back at Fleur de Teas today because my mom had purchased a groupon after some friends bought her a tea pot and she remembered that we had bought a groupon here before. So when the second groupon offer rolled around she bought it right away.  What a nice surprise it was to walk in and find out that they also now sell spice blends! It was magic to my nose! I spent nearly fifteen minutes sniffing every spice blend while my mom chose her tea. The toasted coconut sugar was delicious, there was a balsamic blend that I wanted to lick right out of the bag, and they even had pure vanilla. Amazing! If I could have I would have bought every bag. The prices were pretty reasonable too. I didn't see any bag priced over $7 and most of them were in the $4-5 range.   So now not only should you come for the tea, come for the spice blends! They are all fantastic!

The only reason I know about this place is because a groupon was offered a few months back. I used to live in this area of Tempe but never noticed this place before, even though its in a pretty big building. I was expecting it to be in like a strip mall and a smaller space. I looked at the menu before going and the vegetarian sandwiches sounded pretty good. And there was more than one, so I figured why not try it out. I would have been better off skipping this one.  So my husband and I went in about 6pm and we were the only people in there, which always makes me uncomfortable. My husband asked the guy if its always this dead and he didn't really give us an answer which makes me believe that the staff doesn't have much to do all day. Three more parties came in while we were still there. The service was fast, I'll give them that. I have been to some places before where its been pretty dead, and the service is slower than it should be. So the girl comes out with a plate of pickles and takes our drink order. My husband tasted the pickles first and told me they were super salty. So I tasted them, and they tasted like they were dipped in salt. There were also a couple wedges of what looked like tomato? But I was too afraid to try them to be sure. Then she comes back and takes our order. I got a vegetarian hash with some rye toast. I thought all sandwiches came with a side, but mine didn't. Which is fine, I wasn't that hungry anyway. My husband got a mozzarella, tomato, and italian bread sandwich with a side of fries. My hash was not what I thought it would be. When you think of a hash, you think crispy potatoes, full of veggies, and just really tasty. Mine was none of those things. It was mushy potatoes, and little tiny bits of vegetables. The rye was decent. Nothing special. My husbands sandwich was better than mine. I wish I had gotten something else. The waitress even asked how it was, and I told her it wasn't anything special.  Most of the sandwiches are really overpriced. Most of the non vegetarian sandwiches were around $11, which seems really steep for this kind of place. Maybe they have to make up for the fact that they have no business? I don't know. This place would probably do better in an only take out environment in a smaller space and lowered the price of their sandwiches to a more reasonable price.   I doubt I will be back unless someone else pays for the meal. The food was not good enough that I was like "I need to come back here tomorrow!" and it was really expensive for what it was, even though the portions were pretty big.

We drove out to Casa Grande a few weekends ago 1) because we had nothing better to do and 2) because I wanted to try me some eegee's. I saw on the website that the eegee flavor of the month was watermelon and I wanted to hit this place up before it was gone. It's a bit of a trek for us, 45 minute drive.   We got in around 3pm, not exactly lunch but not exactly dinner either so it was pretty empty. I ordered the 8 inch veggie grinder with no cheese on wheat. +1 for any place that offers wheat bread. I know most places do these days, but its always nice to have that as an option. My husband ordered the 12 inch original grinder on wheat. We also ordered a large fries to share and we each got small watermelon eegee's.   The eegee's were good. I remember coming here many years ago and not liking the eegee's, but I also think it depends on what flavor you get. The regular flavors I have no interest in, but the watermelon was a nice break from the ordinary. I do think that it was too much for me. I only ended up finishing half, so my husband ended up drinking the rest for me. I could do with a 8oz size.   The sandwiches I think were just ok. Not fantastic but they were good. The bread was nice and soft and there was a good amount of veggies. However, the girl explained that there was carrots on the veggie but I didn't find any. I did find a ton of black olives which I picked off cause I dislike them. But the dressing was good on the sandwich.   The fries were the best part. So skinny and crispy. Exactly how I love my fries. And I know ranch dressing is a disgusting concoction, but the ranch here is so good. Its like crack. I kept eating all the fries hoping my husband wouldn't notice how many I had had and he didn't exactly get his fair share. Next time I will have to get my own fries.   I hope they open an eegee's someday in the Phoenix area, but for now I am willing to drive here once in awhile if the craving strikes.

Stopped in here after dinner one night while I was in the area and also because we were in the possession of a groupon. I had been to a yogurt shop or two before coming here so I knew what to expect. Most of these places are basically the same with ten or so flavors of yogurt out at a time, and they rotate flavors, and then a large bar if you will of toppings to add to your yogurt. Simple.   The thing about Yogurtology that sets it apart from every other yogurt shop are three things. One, they list the ingredients by the flavors. So if you avoid eggs you know to watch out for the E under the flavor. Same with milk and wheat ingredients. I have been to three different shops at this point and neither of the others display this information, so you would have to ask someone and they don't always know the answers. This was a nice convenience to have, since I was avoiding eggs at the time. Second, they let you have as many samples as you want. There was a girl who stood there with cups who asked what kind of samples you wanted and let you try as many as you please. Most places don't have sample cups and if you ask for them you get attitude. Third, instead of little chopped up pieces of candy at the bar, they had very large pieces and sometimes whole candy bars! Granted, this isn't the best thing for people who have no self control, but it was nice to see whole twix and kitkat bars. There was also a nice selection of fruit, nuts, and other toppings.  I would come back again and if given a choice I would choose Yogurtology over any of the other yogurt shops. Hopefully I can find a location closer to my house so I don't have to drive all the way up to Scottsdale.

We have been here a few times now, and when we feel like taking the drive down here, we prefer it to In-N-Out most times. The only thing they don't have that we miss is chocolate shakes. I would love to dunk the fries here into a chocolate shake.   They offer a "veggie burger" that is basically all of their condiments on a bun. You can add cheese if you like as well. I think its pretty good and its a nice break from the basic veggie patties you see at most places. They have the best fries here. We like the cajun style the best, and the regular size is plenty for two people. They basically fill up one cup full of fries and put it in the bag, and then dump another full cup in the bag. So you are getting two cups of fries. We never finish them. They are made to order so they are always piping hot. Friendly staff and you can munch on some peanuts before your food comes out.   For two veggie burgers, fries, and two drinks we can get out of here at less than $15. Regular burgers and hot dogs end up costing more so if you are an omnivore it could get a little pricy. But for us vegetarians its a darn good deal.

Another groupon purchase, another new restaurant to try that I would not have know about if I had not. And am I ever glad that I found that groupon! This location is in the Esplanade in Phoenix, and there were not many people down there when we went tonight around 7pm. This could either work in their favor, or against it. Could go either way at this point. But it was good for me because I hate waiting for tables and I hate crowded restaurants. Neither of which I had to deal with today. Got in right as we walked in the door, and there were only another 20 or so people in.   We sit down and our waitress promptly takes our drink orders. I ordered tea that for some reason tasted like chap-stick. The waitress took it away and off of our bill. Thank you! I also ordered the Hawaiian punch, and HO-LY SHIT! That thing had so much alcohol in it, I am STILL recovering. Half way through the drink and I was pretty much buzzed. And $5 for all alcoholic drinks?? Yes please!  So I went with my mom, husband and sister. I got the vegetarian tacos which were really spicy and good. Next time I think though I will get them with the soft taco shells. I was not too crazy about the hard shells. And their beans are amazing!! Have I told you how much I love beans? I especially love vegetarian black beans, and an entire plate of them. SO GOOD! My husband got the baja fish tacos, mom got street tacos I think, and my sister another meat taco. All were happy with their choices. And even though it looks like not that much food, everyone except the half drunk me left food on their plates. They are really filling.   Thank god I bought two groupons because I will definitely be coming back here for some more drinks and tacos.

So I decided to wait until I wasn't tipsy to write my update of Fuego Tacos. I went again last night for my birthday and had a fantastic meal. The chips that come out when you sit down are warm and fresh and super crispy and they are probably the best chips I have ever had in a restaurant. The salsa is so good and has a really nice kick of spicy that I love. The drinks are super strong, I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea, which I like because I don't drink often (in fact the last time I drank was the last time I was at Fuego Tacos) but when I do drink I want to feel buzzed and these drinks will get you there about halfway through one drink. Either that or I am a super lightweight. The specialty drinks on the menu are $5, but I guess custom drink orders not on the menu are a bit more because my Long Island was $7. Beer I think is $4.   I ordered the spicy vegetable tacos again but this time with soft shells, and they were much better. I didn't even finish them this time because I was so full. I also got a full plate of black beans again. They make me happy. My husband got the shrimp tacos and he liked them much better than the fish tacos he got last time. We also ordered the churros and they were delicious. Hot and crispy with what our waiter called a spicy chocolate dipping sauce but I didn't taste anything spicy. Tasted more like bananas to me. But it was good either way. Our waiter was fantastic. He said things like "love it" and it made me laugh.   It sad to walk through the Esplanade and it not be busy at all. It seems strange to put this restaurant in this location since it doesn't seem to be doing well. Hopefully they can pull through and are here for a long time because I love this place.

Please, please, PLEASE, whatever you do, do not order the mini vegetarian tostadas they have as a special addition to the menu. They were no bueno. I was expecting the same spicy vegetable mixture as the tacos and it was really bland and boring. And the "chipotle" aoli squirted on top was really gross and just tasted like mayonnaise. It fell apart as I was trying to eat it and I ended up not finishing it. On top of all that, they were $9 with no side!!! What a travesty! I had to spend extra money to get my beloved black beans.   However, the latin lover drink was delicious. And I even had a second one. I don't know if there was less alcohol than usual or I am just becoming more tolerant to alcohol because I have never had more than one drink at a time in my life. But the second drink was only $3. Which was nice.

After purchasing a groupon a few months back, we decided that we would would go to dinner at Taberna one Saturday night. My husband and I went with my mother. Walking up to the space I loved the outdoor patio that no one was seated at. Yes it was over 100 degrees but the sun was starting to go down and a breeze was blowing and the misters were going. We decided to be the first ones on the patio. It was so pretty.   Our waiter comes and takes our drink order. I ordered the fresh fruit margarita, which that days fruit was pink grapefruit, and my husband ordered iced tea. I liked the margarita. It had a good kick to it but not too much alcohol that it knocked me out. It was nice and refreshing with the grapefruit. We also received a basket of chips and salsa. There were two different kinds of salsa and the chip basket looked like there were at least four varieties of chips. I liked the plantain chips the most. Neither of the salsas were spicy which was kind of disappointing. I like spicy salsas. We ordered the guacamole as an appetizer as well and I was also disappointed with this. No spice here either. But it was tasty. I liked the pumpkin seeds with it. For dinner my husband and I both ordered the chile rellano and my mom ordered the vegetarian enchiladas. Our chiles were good. One large chili stuffed with a variety of veggies, roasted with cheese and served with a tomato sauce. I really liked the tomato sauce it was placed on. Very tasty and it had a pretty nice spice to it. I liked that it was different from most chili rellanos and it wasn't coated in eggs and deep fried. A nice change from the ordinary. The enchiladas looked like more of a stacked enchilada with cheese and a variety of veggies. I had a bite of this as well. It was also pretty good.   The food was a little bit pricey. Without the $40 groupon we had the total came out to be a little over $60. Which seems expensive for what we got. However, I would come back again because the food was really good. It would end up being more of a special occasion place though. But definitely worth trying again..... Apparently they have closed since I went a couple weeks ago. Sad. They should have tried restructuring their menu and prices first instead of closing. Seems like they just opened too.

I love olive oil. I would drink it if I wasn't worried about people judging me. And when I come here, I can drink it without strange stares! Outrageous Olive Oils and Vinegars I am convinced was created just for me and my love of all things olive oil. I have been in here twice now and I know that I will be back many times more. I found out about this place from groupon and also purchased a deal on living social. I have ended up with three bottles; basil oil, wild mushroom and sage oil, as well as the 18 year old balsamic.  The set up of this place is great. You walk in, and you are greeted by many hundreds of bottles of oils and vinegars and you can taste test to your hearts content. You pick up a little stack of cups and you can mix and match and taste till you find the olive oil and vinegar that was made for you. I could spend hours in here finding endless combinations of oil and vinegars, but then I would be broke because I would end up buying tons of bottles. If you don't have any idea what you are doing when you walk in here, the ladies who work here are more than willing to help you and suggest combinations as well as ideas of how to use all oils and vinegars.   Olive oil is heart healthy, and what better place to make your heart happy than this!

One of the better places to get some frozen yogurt, and since this is the location closest to my house, we tend to come here more than any other place we have been to so far.   There is no indication next to the names of the yogurts what ingredients are in it, so I am docking a star for that. I'm trying to avoid eating eggs as much as I can and it is always helpful when that information is available without having to ask. I have been on the website enough times now to know which flavors have eggs and which don't so its not a problem for me anymore, but for anyone else it would be. But the flavors I have had have all been good. The fruity pebble flavor I had awhile ago actually tasted just like the cereal. It was a fun flavor.   The topping bar is a good size. There are fruits, candies, and nuts among other toppings. My husband and I are generally happy with this topping bar.   The best thing about this location is on Wednesdays, if you come in wearing pajamas (or something resembling pajamas) you get 50% off your total! Its a great deal. The last time we only paid $5 for the two of us. It gets pretty busy on Wednesdays but its not too bad.

So our valves were leaking above our washing machine and we needed to get them replaced. Before we had remembered we had a home warranty we called Plumbing Medic to come fix them so we could use our new washer and dryer. The guy came out same day and looks at the valves for about a minute before explaining to us what needed to be done. He wanted to cut a hole in our wall under the valves to replace the entire pipe and then the valves on top, and he wanted to charge us $500 to do it. I may be a first time home owner but I know when I am being screwed over, because the minute that I basically said no and that we wont be having this guy fix it, he started dropping his price, eventually all the way down to $300. The last thing he said was "well how much were you expecting to pay?" I didn't have a number in mind but I know when I am being jerked around. If you can't give me your lowest and best price first, don't bother giving me one at all. After he left, we remembered our home warranty and called them. It ended up not being covered by them either, but they did the job for $187.50. And there was no BS about starting high and eventually getting to that price. He straight out charged us a fair price for the work that needed to be done. I just regret calling these guys and having to pay them a service fee for just having someone come out to screw with us.

BEST HAPPY HOUR EVER! Seriously, how can you go wrong with half off ANY roll on the menu??? You can't! And they even have happy hour twice a day! So if you miss the early happy hour, you can still come for the late one.  Thank you Groupon for leading me to Iron Chef! This is by far my favorite place to eat sushi. So far I have been three times but you can bet if I lived any closer I would probably be here every week. They have a nice sized selection of veggie rolls, all of which I have tried. They are simple, but the avocado rolls, and the sweet potato tempura rolls are by far my favorite. The rolls are also nicely sized themselves. I never leave here hungry for sure. The last time we were here, we ordered so many rolls that they brought them all out on a bridge! It was pretty awesome.  The service is really great as well. Everyone who works here is really friendly.   If you haven't been here yet, try it. Vegetarians and fish lovers all will be happy with the selection here.

Come on guys, really? I actually just finished this cupcake that I was really excited to try and I am glad to say that at least I didn't buy more than one. That was the sorriest excuse for a cupcake I have ever experienced. Well, probably not EVER ever, but at least in a long time.   I had no idea this place existed until two days ago, even though my gym is in the same complex. I saw a friend post pictures of cupcakes on facebook and stalked until someone asked where she got them. Upon finding out, I went to look them up and convinced my husband we needed to try them. After the amazing experience I have had at Mind Over Batter in Tempe, I wasn't expecting what I got today.  We walk in and the first thing we see, and I should have taken this as a bad sign, are three very large, old women buying dozens of cupcakes. Apparently they have two different sizes, large and standard, and when one of these large old women asked why in the world anyone would ever want a standard sized cupcake, my husband commented to me "because of obesity." I still laugh about his comment. These cupcakes are larger than necessary and I am sure loved by all those overweight, but they should have the standard size out for those of us who don't feel like eating 5 1/2 oz of cupcake in a single sitting. I ordered the strawberry cupcake because that is what I base every cake company on, and my husband ordered the fox 10 cupcake. The whole time workers kept trying to give us forks even though twice I told them I didn't want one. Were they trying to tell me something? I don't know. They also didn't seem very friendly at all. The credit card machine also takes FOREVER!   We drive down to my husbands school where we were heading and start to dig in. The frosting is SO gritty. It is also covered in glitter, which I didn't find appealing. And why the hell is there so much of it?? I scraped off all of the frosting and just ate the cake, which was also just as bad. I didn't try my husbands cake, which was chocolate, but mine was weird and tasted a lot like kool-aid or fruit punch, or something. I have never had a strawberry cupcake taste so artificial. Oh wait, yes I have. Its called a box mix. It tasted just like it came out of a box. There were red chunks of something in my cake batter. Not sure what the hell those were. Gummies? Not real strawberries that's for sure.   What a waste of $7. Please, for God sakes. Hit up Mind Over Batter in Tempe if you want a really good cupcake. This place does not deliver at all.

Thanks to my friend Groupon, I found the best gelato shop in Arizona. I have tried a lot of different gelato shops over these past few months and this one is by far the best most authentic gelato shop I have been to, that wasn't in Italy. The owners of this shop and the one located in Mesa, learned to make gelato and worked in gelato shops in Italy, making this the most authentic gelato you will find on this side of the Atlantic.   We came in here the first time a couple of weeks ago to redeem our groupon. There was no one else in here at the time, and I will admit the owner seemed a little unfriendly at first, but she warmed up eventually. My husband and I both got large sizes with three flavors each. I got root beer, pistachio, and amaretto. All were amazing. The flavor and texture of the gelato was the best I have ever had. The crispy cookie that is stuck in your gelato is so good! So flaky and delicious. We also decided to get a cannelloni, which is filled on site while you wait. We should have eaten it right away but we took it home and stuck it in the fridge to eat the next day, which just made the pastry soggy and I didn't enjoy it that much. I have never really been a fan of cannelloni anyways.   The second time we came was this weekend after dinner. This time I decided on a waffle cone with roasted almond, pumpkin, and amaretto again. All flavors were delicious. The cone houses way too much ice cream though. I had to struggle to finish the whole thing. So I probably wont get such a large size again. My husband got a gelato shake, and my mom and niece shared a single cone with chocolate gelato.   The price of the gelato here is the cheapest out of any shop I have been to. Which makes it easy to go for the larger sizes. The flavors are also color coded to indicate what ingredients are in each flavor (for food allergies). There is a sign on the counter detailing what each of the colors mean.   This shop is pretty far from our house, and the one in Mesa isn't any closer either. Hopefully one day they will open a shop in Chandler! *Cross my fingers*. This gelato is amazing, and you wont be disappointed.

This review is a little overdue (I went over two months ago) but that doesn't take away any of the fun my family and I had while we were there. We found Vertuccio Farms on Groupon and they were offering a great deal for the whole family we couldn't pass up. So one Saturday morning many weeks back we took a drive out to Gilbert to visit the farm. I think we went the last weekend that it was open for the season.   The place was not very crowded, which I liked. It was however pretty muddy and wet because of the rain that had fallen before we came. The staff was trying to keep the mud under control with hay but it wasn't working out so well. But it wasn't so bad that we couldn't have a good time.   The very first thing we did when we walked in was ride the barrel train around the farm. You get one ride included in your ticket price. This was pretty fun, though my motion sickness acted up (I am pretty sensitive about moving in things that don't use my legs). So we got to see all of the activities available without having to walk around. And we did pretty much all of the rest of the activities while we were there. There were bouncy horses, which I did not participate in but the rest of my family thought they were hysterical. Some pedal bikes, a large bouncy area for kids, a small playground, farm animal feedings. There is a thing they call a "pizza farm". From the website: "What is a Pizza Farm? The pizza farm is a one-half acre circular garden that is divided into eight pie shaped "slices" (like a pizza) and grows or grazes all the ingredients needed to make a farm fresh pizza! You will learn how farmers grow wheat for the crust, tomatoes for the sauce..dairy cows or goats that give milk to make cheese, pigs for pepperoni, and much more!" This was pretty fun. I always like to look at growing vegetables and herbs. There is even a large 10 acre corn maze that has a different design every year.   We all had a pretty good time here and would come back again in the future. My three year old niece was pretty excited by everything here. So not only a good time for kids, it was fun for the four adults in our party as well.

I ate here once a few weeks back with a Groupon that was about to expire. I went with my mom and husband and we got there just as the restaurant was opening for dinner service. I wasn't aware that they closed between lunch and dinner so when we showed up right before 5 it was a little awkward. I almost thought it had closed down because it looked that way from the outside. They have a decent sized patio in the front that is not utilized. The place would look so much more welcoming if something was done with the front of the building. So we get in and are seated. Not long after three more parties show up and are seated while we were dining. The service was fast and friendly as our waiter quickly came over to take drink and food orders. I asked some questions about what was vegan on the menu and the waiter pointed out a few items and we picked out two, and my mom got a lamb dish.   The two dishes we ordered were the Masala Aloo Gobi, which is a potato and cauliflower curry,  and Chana Masala, which was a chickpea with curry spices. My mom and husband also ordered some bread for the table, which I didn't eat because it contained dairy. The food was ok. I was surprised by both how simple they were and the portion sizes considering our entrees were ten dollars each. I felt like I could have made this at home for no more than a few dollars of ingredients. I was also expecting some heat in the dishes, but there was none. There was a nice curry flavor but I didn't feel like the dishes lived up to the name of the restaurant. My mom liked her lamb dish but also said that she has had better elsewhere. The final bill for three entrees, the bread, and my husband ordered a mango drink was a couple dollars short of $50, which seemed crazy to me considering how little food is actually given.  After some thought, I most likely wont be returning here. It's not that the food was terrible or the service was bad, everyone was actually really friendly, I just don't feel like we got a good deal, and I feel that I could make curry just as well or better than here on my own and for a lot less money.

Oh Babbo. I love you, but you've done me wrong this time.   I have been to Babbo a few times and a few different locations. The first Babbo experience i had was the one located in Cave Creek, and it was amazing. I was eating dairy then, and had the Alfredo Supreme. The bread at the table is so good. And I tried one of my sisters zucchini chips. Those are addicting. The next two times I went to the Babbo located in Phoenix. I had the chalkboard menu with the portabello with beets and brussels sprouts. It was good, but greasy. The side of vegetables were dried out and gross though. The time after that I was no longer eating dairy, so I had the Roasted Brussels SproutBeet Salad with no cheese, and I really liked it.  I had been waiting for this location in Tempe to open up for quite awhile. I drove by the space a few months ago and when it said "Babbo coming soon!" I got so excited. I added Babbo to my facebook and waited for the day that it opened. Well, last week we got the chance to finally go and we decided to take my mom for her birthday dinner.   From the start, we could tell the experience was not going to be that great. It was busy, which was because it had just opened. But this location has such a small waiting area. You are almost forced to stand outside in the 100 degree heat to wait for a table. It took us about twenty minutes to get a table, which wasn't that bad. We had noticed when we walked in that there was this fat old guy in a chefs hat circling the tables. We were making jokes about how the chef should be in the kitchen, and not visiting tables. If he was the chef and wasn't cooking, who was? Anyways, we sat down and looked at our menus. I noticed the new roasted garlic hummus and we ordered that. I double checked with the waitress that there was no dairy in it and told her that I also have a dairy allergy as well as being vegan. So after we ordered that and it came out we ordered dinner. My husband ordered the Amalfi pizza, I ordered the brussels sprout beet salad again with no cheese, and my mom ordered a pasta dish. The hummus came out and it was pretty darn amazing. I wanted to order like a tub of it to take it home with me. I am going to have to go home and experiment with roasted garlic in my hummus. We seemed to be waiting a long time for our food, which also was expected because it was so busy. Not once, but TWICE, the old fat guy in the chefs hat came by to see how we were doing. He saw both times we had no food and claimed he was going to go find out about why it was taking so long but instead he just walked to the next table.   So probably another ten minutes goes by and finally the food comes out, and before the waiter has even dropped the food on the table I already see there is cheese on my salad. Before he sets it down I tell him I ordered it with no cheese because I am allergic. So he tells me he is going to get me a new one. Less than a minute later the salad comes back and he goes "Ok we just did a quick swap" Which I assumed meant they had another one ready back there and gave me a new one. No, it meant he went back there and scraped off the cheese and gave me the same salad. NOTE TO RESTAURANTS EVERYWHERE: this does not fool customers even in the slightest. I have had multiple establishments do this to me in the past and I can always tell. They seem to think the customer is retarded and can't see the tiny specs of cheese still clinging to lettuce leaves. So I refuse to eat it of course, and the waitress comes back and I tell her that the cheese has just been scraped off and there is still some in the actual salad. She tells me how sorry she is and goes to make me a new one. It was another fifteen minutes before I received a new one, which at that point I just wanted to go home. The manager, I am assuming, and the old fat chef come to the table to tell me how sorry they are and how inexcusable it was. They made the excuse that the cook was new, but I am sorry, that shouldn't happen anywhere. Food allergies are a serious thing and cooks should receive training on it before they even step foot in the kitchen.   So we eat and finish, and here is the part that makes me angry. The waitress comes by and tells us to save room for dessert because its on them. Uhhh.... I don't eat dairy or eggs, yet they are going to salvage their mistake with dessert? Makes a whole lot of sense. NOT! So instead of offering to take off my salad for my inconvenience they don't do anything, and we didn't get dessert.  And then here is the kicker.... My husband ended up in the hospital the next morning at 5am because the pizza he ate here was so greasy, it aggravated his gallstones (which were diagnosed that morning at the hospital) and now he has to have surgery to have his gallbladder removed. So thanks for that Babbo.  I am giving this one star because my experience here was just so outrageous, it felt like a bad joke that I didn't get the punchline to.
