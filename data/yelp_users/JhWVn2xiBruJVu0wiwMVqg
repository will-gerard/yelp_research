My review is about Cindy Casey--I went to her today for a haircut and am very pleased with it.  Cindy makes you feel right at home.  She really listened and did an awesome job.  You won't go wrong with her for a good cut.

Ok I can only say this: WTF?  No wonder this chain is having financial problems.  I went in to find items that were in the Sunday sales circular and this location had NONE of them. Again WTF?  Nor did they have any staff that cared about helping anyone find anything.  I was in that store looking for things for about 30 minutes and the only person who spoke to me was the panhandler outside the store.  The paid staff was too busy somewhere else 'cause they sure weren't visible in the store.

ok here is my story:  one evening i start getting some chest pains.  i tried tums, ect.  nothing helped.  aftera  couple of hours, my husband insists on taking me to the closest ER.  we go in, they take my information and we wait.  and wait.  they take my blood.  we wait. they get a chest xray.  we wait.  they do an ekg.  we wait.   oh did i mention that the ER was virtually deserted?  two other people came in while we were waiting.  i finally get back to a room, where i am told that they do all the testing before the patient see the dr so the dr can be fully informed.  while this makes sense, when the patient is a mid 40's women with chest pains.....does it really make sense?   anyway i finally get to see a dr. i give my medical history for the 3rd time.  the nurse gives me morphine and nitro then leaves.  after awhile, i start to feel bad. real bad.  i hit my 'call' button several times and NO ONE responds. i pass out and start seizing; luckily my husband was with me and runs into the hall yelling for help.  (so he tells me; i can't vouch for it since i was out of it).  i wake up to a dr thumping my chest saying 'ok we got her back, there she is'.  DAMN!   turns out they gave me a combination of meds that caused my BP to drop so low that i damn near died.  if my husband hadn't been there i would have died since NO ONE responded to the call button.  then they decide gee guess we better keep her overnight just in case. meanwhile, my pain is still there. it feels like a steel band is around my chest. the admitting dr is someone else entirely and again i have to give my medical history.  do these people not talk to each other? so i go from there to the observation unit were the nurses were terrific.  couldn't ask for better care--charity, denise, jan, ect they were all wonderful.    i had a ct scan, an ultrasound, cardio enyzemes, and no sleep.  i finally get to check out @ 12 on 6/14.  today i get the bill for it.  i was there for about 12 hours, they damn near killed me, i had 1 xray, 1 ct, 1ultrasound, various blood draws, 3 morphine shots and 3 blood draws.  oh and lets not forget the wonderful breakfast.   all this comes to a total of ..........(drum roll please) $16,300.00.    and they have no idea what was causing the chest pain and recommend.............. further testing. next time maybe i will try john c lincoln.

I originally joined this Y in '06.  My attendance was sporadic, in part because of the lack of welcoming attitude of the staff.  The one class that keep me going was the Hatha Yoga w/Noreen. I moved out of state for a year for work purposes.  When I returned to AZ in '09, I found out that Hatha Yoga w/Noreen was now offered 4 times a week at this Y.  I promptly joined again.   Sure I go and do cardio and some other things at the Y, and they have a great varity of cardio  machines and there is no waiting for them.  Lots of weights, both machine and free for use.  Again enough so there isn't waiting.  Aqua classes, fitness classes, body pump, ect. are offered.  The gym & locker rooms are clean and the staff there now is much more friendly. But the gem of this Y, in my opinion, is the Hatha Yoga class taught by Noreen.  I have taken yoga classes all over the states and in some pretty fancy yoga studios.  By far the best class, especially for the money since it is included in the Y membership (drop in non-members $5) is the Hatha Yoga by Noreen. She guides you through the poses, encouring you to work to your edge and listen to your body.  Lots of attention is paid to the participants form.  This class is   Tues/Thurs @ 8 am , Fri/Sun @ 9.  The Sunday class is frequently crowded.  Get there early.

I want to paint my bedroom.  I found a color I thought might work and as luck would have it my local Ace Hardware was the place for it.  So I dropped in there this morning thinking I would purchase a sample size to see how the color looked on the wall.   The guy who was providing me customer service informed me "we don't give samples". I explained I was expecting to pay for a sample, not be given one and his response was buy a quart or nothing.  No sample sizes for paint.  No wonder Ace Hardware stores are struggling to survive.  Who buys paint without a sample first? I mean, Home Depot, Lowes, Sherman Williams, they all have sample sizes.  And they all have better customer service.

This locally owned family run store features one of a kind designs.  They have something to suit everyone, from diamonds to semi precious stones.  The store was busy the entire time I was there.  The owner, Scott,  is terrific.  He takes his time with a client and one can tell he loves what he does.  He designs alot of the jewerly himself.  No two pieces are alike.   I went in, took some of the things I no longer wear (old wedding ring from first marriage, ect) Scott gave me a great trade in amount for them and I left with two pairs of earring and a ring and money left on account.   I get compliments whenever I wear jewelry from Treasures.  If you like one of a kind items or want a custom design, this is THE place to go.

Pie.  I love pie.  And I love their pie.  However, not all their pie.  The peach is blah.  The blueberry pie w/crumb topping is excellent, their rhubarb w/crumb topping is my favorite,  The meringue pies are great.  Haven't tried any of the creme pies........yet.   I only go for the pie.

Stopped here on the way home and got a blueberry crumble pie and some pecan sticky buns.  Love the pie.  Will try the sticky buns for breakfast but really it's bread, sugar and pecans so it's gotta be good.

Have now gone here twice, both times for lunch.  The first time I had a salad and my friend had a burger.  I was consumed with burger envy after seeing her burger and wasn't too impressed with my salad. Naturally the next time I went back I ordered a burger.  It was wonderful.  Cooked to order (med rare for me) with lots of flavor.  The fries are delish; crispy and well seasoned.  My mouth waters just thinking about it.  I may have to go there for lunch or dinner today.   I haven't tried anything else on the menu, but a friend says the wings are great.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  The cocktails tasty.   If you want a great burger, this is THE place to go.

So I have never been a fan of vet chains. I have always preferred the old fashioned small vet places feeling, perhaps unjustly, that my animals would get better care there.  I really really hate being wrong. And I hate writing about it even more.  But in this instance I just have to tell my story even if it means admitting I was wrong.  I took my new 8 week old pup, Maggie, to this Banfield because the shelter I got her from gave me a $30 off coupon for her shots.  They were great with her and sold me on the Wellness Plan.  $25 a month and her visits are free for shots, exams, ect.  Last weekend my now 13 week old pup decided to take on a bee and the bee won.  Maggie looked like Snoopy.  Being new to puppies in Arizona and worried about a scorpion sting (before I figured out it was a bee) I did the typical new mom panic and called the vet.  They were very understanding and made time to see her right away.  We hopped in the car and drove right over.  No waiting to be seen and no ridicule about my panic.  Vet took his time and checked her all over.  Pronounced it a bee sting (oh the embarassment for me) gave her a cordisone shot and told me not to worry.  Sheesh.  The cost for this emergency visit?  $18 bucks for the shot  and $42 I spent on more toys for Maggie.

About two weeks ago, Mike from Master and Sons came out and looked at our ac unit..  As we knew it was toast from the hail storm and he confirmed it.  Mike took his time and explained the difference in the SEER rating and the difference in the makes of ac units.   When he left he said he would have an estimate to us that day.  I had the estimate within two  hours.  Totally amazing.  So we hired them to do the job, put a deposit down and made an appt for yesterday.  They showed up on time and got the job done; no fuss no muss.  Cleaned up after themselves and were polite and courteous the entire time.  Highly recommend them if you need any heating/cooling work done.

I love this place.  I go at least once a month during the winter for pedi's and more often in the summer.  They take their time and really do a good job.  Love the hot rock massage that is included with the pedi.  Kim does great mani's too but their pedis rock.

I was unsure when I first saw the place--I mean, from the outside it doesn't look like anything special.  Going in didn't change that impression.  And Asian Mexican fusion? But one bite of the jade red chicken and cuban beans and I was hooked.  I love this place.  The atmosphere is cafeteria type but  the food and  the snickerdoodles more then compensate for that.  It's all good.

This is a great place.  The food is consistently good the atmosphere is nice and the entire place is clean.  The server are pleasant, the food cost is reasonable and the monogolian beef is wonderful.  This place has the velveting down pat.  The Garlic shrimp with noodles is to die for.  They use fresh vegies and nothing is greasy.  We go there at least once every couple of weeks.  Very reasonable priced.

My friend Oriana  and I went here the other day for impromptu pedi's.  Jane from Fast Signs recommended Perfect Nails to me.  It's easy to find but parking is not great the Starbucks next door takes up alot of spots. On the good side you can get a latte to savor while having your nails done.  Good sized place, very clean.  We didn't have to wait at all which is always a plus.  Timothy did my pedi and he did a great job.  My deluxe pedi was $35 which I think is about the going rate.   They also have a  reward card so you can build up point for free services.   Very happy with it and will go back.

Gotta say I don't care for, or eat, anything but the custard at Freddy's.  It is hands down the best frozen custard I have ever had anywhere.  If you love ice cream you will love Freddy's.

So this Safeway is the store that is closest to my house.  That said it has become my 'go to' store when I need something on short notice.  However, it has also become my 1st choice for shopping.  Not because Safeway has great sales or prices; or because the store is clean and generally well stocked although lately I have been chagrined at their lack of choices in Hagen Daazs Ice Cream. ;o)  It is the staff at this store that does it for me.  Betty and Nicole in the Pharmacy are absolutely the best; I have never had such great service from any pharmacy.  They go out of their way to make sure the customer is taken care of and happy.  John in the meat department will do any specialty cut I ask for and is a great source if you are unsure as to what cut will work best for the dish you are making.  The checkers are wonderful; friendly and helpful.  I always enjoy chatting with Ryan when I am there.  Barry and Anthony are great courtesy clerks, always happy to help with the heavy stuff. All in all what the store lacks in product and prices the staff more than makes up for.   For me, as for most consumers, customer service makes a huge difference when choosing were I shop.  I may get better prices at WalMart but I won't get the same service and consideration I get at Safeway.  That is what makes this Safeway great.

So I have never eaten alot of Indian food, but friends of ours suggested dinner there so we went.  I am so glad I did! Talk about delish!  The Chicken Saag was one of the best things I have ever eaten.   Prices are reasonable, service is so-so and the food=yummo. We had chicken saag, chicken tikki masala, fish masala, garlic naan and rice.  The four of us left stuffed and happy.   It was so good, I went back the following week for lunch only to discover some terrific lunch specials.  8 bucks for more lunch then you can eat.  All I can say is "GO".

Have been going to Pappaduex's off and on for awhile now.  Seems like I go through spurts where I wind up there several times in a row then not going back for what seems like a year.  That said, this chain is consistently good.  The service is always good, some times better than others but never bad.   It is hard to find good creole and/or cajun food here and while this may not be considered authentic, it is good.  The alligator is lip smackin' good. The atmosphere is somewhat lacking as the acoustics make conversation almost impossible.  Not a good place for a romantic meal, but a good place to have fun with friends.

This place has it all.  Great food, great ambiance, great wine and great service.  Went there the other night. I had veal scallopini, my husband had linguine with seafood in a spicy red sauce.  Both were wonderful.  The chocolate gelato was great and my cannoli tasty.   I love that Joe visits with each table and 'shakes the can' for the chance to win a free meal.   They now have 'Joe's back door' new york style pizza to go. You order ahead and literally pick it up at the back door.  That is on my 'gotta try that list".

Great service, great ambiance, great food.  Can't get any better than this!  Four of us went  and each ordered different meals. We started with the sangria, which was a very pleasant surprise.  Not overly sweet and very flavorful.  The yucca chips melt in ones mouth.    The ahi tuna was wonderful, the apple cider pork tenderloin melted in the mouth, the scallops were cooked perfectly and my cavitalli w/italian sausage was great.   For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu and the chocolate hazelnut cake.  Both were delish and it was possibly the largest serving of tiramisu I have ever seen.  Our server, Nick, was attentive and friendly without being overbearing.    The place was packed; I recommend reservations if you decide to go. You won't go wrong here.

Went to NoRTH yesterday with friends for happy hour.  This place is great.  Half price drinks & appetizers. Their yucca chips are totally additive and the angus burger for $5 w/garlic fries is one of the best burgers around.  Our server, Ivan, was terrific.  Very attentive and funny.    All around a great place to hang out and enjoy good friends and good food.

This was my second trip to Flemings.  My first time was for a luncheon and it convinced me to take my husband and some friends for dinner.  The ambiance is warm and inviting, the wine list extensive.  Our server, Kurtis, was a self described 'wine geek' and made great recommendations.   Since Flemings is a steak house, 2 of us played it safe and had the fillet mignon.  Melt in your mouth delish.  My husband had the 'surf and turf' Flemings style, which consisted of the fillet covered with lobster in butter & white wine sauce.   My friend Lauren opted for the ahi tuna.  She loved it.  The creamed spinach is so good, I contemplated ordering it for my meal.   Although full, we all managed to force down the chocolate mousse with hazelnut bark for dessert.  And what a dessert.....creamy, rich, decadent.   Actually, next time I will do the mousse first, then if I have room I will look at the entrees.....or maybe another order of the mousse.

We took our good friend Patti to Flemings for her birthday dinner.  We were seated immediately (love that!) and Patti was offered champagne on the house for her birthday.  She declined as she doesn't drink, but what a great policy! Makes me want to go there for my birthday.  I do drink so I ordered a cosmo and it was eh.  We all went for the filet mignon's with a side of creamed spinach.  Absolutely delish.  I was disappointed that the mousse I was so looking forward to wasn't on the menu, but made do with the molten chocolate lava cake which was only so-so.  Patti had the fresh berries with chantilly cream and loved it.  Flemings compted the dessert for the birthday girl.  The service was superb.  All in all a wonderful evening.

Walk into Poppa Maize and the first thing that hits you is the wonderful smells.  The second thing is the array of popcorn flavors, everything from tradional buttered to coffee flavored.  There are seasonal flavors (the candy cane popcorn was delish) and old standby's.  The owners are locals who work hard to please there customers and it shows.  My personal favorite is the old standby caramel corn, with the coffee and peanut butter chocolate vying for second place.  My husband loves the chipotle cheese.  The butter pecan is also to die for.  Basically, they are all wonderful.   Give it a try, you will be hooked.

So today was my last of a series of three photofacials at Millennium.  I bought the set @ Groupon and was frankly skeptical.  I mean could they really get rid of my scars and hyperpigmentation?  Well, happy to say YES THEY CAN.   It is a welcoming place right from when one walks in; the staff is attentive and caring. Annette is a miracle worker.  She spend time with me before my first treatment to discuss my 'trouble' spots and what I could expect from the photofacials.  She explained that my hyperpigmented spots would initially appear darker, almost coffee groundish, before fading.  She is very detail orientated and concerned with the clients comfort and getting each client the best possible results.   After my 2nd treatment my hyperpigmentation was almost gone as are my scars.  Today we worked on the fine lines by my eyes a bit also.  Can't wait to see how this all looks next week and am planning on going in for a light chemical peel next month.   A note of interest-Annette and her husband own this business. They are local and I love to support local businesses.  This isn't a big chain place, or a place owned by people who have several locations.  This is it and they work hard to make their clients happy.   Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.

I have attended two classes at Blissful in the past week.  While vastly different classes, both instructors were in tune with the participants, guiding them in their practice while helping us to maintain postures. The hot yoga was wonderful and hard work, the yinyasa was a more reflective class that concentrated on opening specific parts of the body.  I will be attending more classes there in the next two weeks as they have a two weeks for $25 offer; all the yoga classes you want to attend for $25?  Now that is blissful!

It was only ok.  There were 4 of us, we ordered an appetizer and a dessert and the bill was $104 w/out the tip.  Service was so so; seems no one remembered to bring the drinks we requested.  The dessert tray we ordered came with different items on it as they were out of the items that were listed on the menu.  Which is ok, but if I had know that ahead of time I wouldn't have ordered the dessert.  While the food we did order was good I won't go out of my way to go back.

Tutti Santi by Nina in Glendale has only been open a short while in the Citadelle shopping area.   We went there on Saturday evening with friends and it was a great evening.  My ravioli was melt in your mouth tender.  My husband had cioppino w/white sea bass and loved it.  Our friends also loved their meals.  For dessert we ordered 1 chocolate mousse to share and wound up fighting over it.  Simply the best mousse I have ever had.  The wine list is lengthy and  the staff is knowledgable about the wines and how to best pair them with the dishes.  The service is superb and the restuarants tradition of ending your meal with sambuca for all is the perfect way to end the evening.

I was so happy to see a 5 Guys in Phoenix.  I love their burgers and this place is just as good as the ones on the east coast.  The burgers are cooked fresh when you order them. the burger is juicy, the bacon is crispy  and the cheese melty. Delish.  You can choose from a wide selection of toppings at no additional cost.   I always get the small bacon cheeseburger and a drink. No fries.  All 5 guys fries are limp. I like my fries crunchy.  If they changed their fries I would up them to a 5 star rating.  For those that like a juicy burger reminescent  of what you make at home, with toppings customized to fit your appetite for the day 5 Guys is it.

I went there on May 6, 2010. I had a $25 gift certificate for food and am always open to a new place.  It was bike night but the place wasn't packed.  Service was very very slow and the food, once we finally got our order, was only ok.  The drinks were watered down as by the time we got them the had plainly been sitting for awhile  and were warm.  I don't mind paying for good food, service and drinks but this place had none of the above and my (warm) martini was $13 during happy hour.  Won't go back.

Ok so my friends talked me into going back and giving it another shot.  Mistake.  If possible, service was even worse.  I was there on Thursday evening and when we arrived it was virtually empty.  The servers would literally walk by our table and look at us but not come over.  We finally talked to the manager, Mike, and that helped.  The food was very good this time.  Still not a place I would choose to go.

I took advantage of the Groupon special for the pedis here.  Looks blah from outside but the interior is actually cool.  I liked the music and the cocktail with the pedi.  Great way to relax.  No spa chairs, but rather large deep couches to sit on while getting your pedi.  Didn't care for that as I couldnt' sit all the way back and relax.  No table for the cocktail so I was holding the glass the entire time.  The water in a bucket (yes a tin bucket) is a cute idea and ok for at home but when I go out for a spa pedi I prefer a spa for my feet.  And I like hot water. The pedi was so so.  Not much massage or callus removal.  As for the polish, selection of colors is limited and the application is so so probably because of the lack of light in the place.  The girls working there are loud and friendly but mostly interested in talking about themselves and their problems.  I don't know about you, but when I go and pay for a service I don't want to hear it.  Won't go back and pay $45 for a pedi there.

Went to Ninfa's the other night with friends.  I was totally prepared to dislike it since I loved NoRTH and was so unhappy to see it go.  Also, I have to admit I thought, yeah just what we need another mexican food chain.   Happy to say Ninfa's is just what we need.  The atmosphere is warm and welcoming.  The staff is on top of it.  The food is great.  Not traditional mexican, but mexican with a twist that is wonderful. The house chips and the dark red salsa are great. The cilantro salsa was only ok. The red salsa has a smokey heat to it that is addictive.  I had the steak tacos, which were served in flour tortillas, looking more like a burrito. No onions or ciliantro in sight. Cooked perfectly and very tasty.  My spouse had beef fajitas that he devoured.  One of our friends had the mussels in the spice sauce, the other the chicken hard shell tacos.  Both almost licked their plates.   The sangria margarita is tasty but for me the traditional margarita rocked.  Not too sweet not too sour.  Made with fresh lime juice not the bottled sweet and sour mix.  I could be very happy there with the margaritas, chips and red salsa......

Ok I agree that the owner(s) may be quirky.  Adds to the charm of the place as far as I am concerned.  I went there on Wednesday only to discover they don't open until 10 am.  Thought that was kinda weird for a bakery. Went back the next day @ 4 and there wasn't alot left but what was there looked fab. Let me explain I am not a fan of most european bakeries sweets because they are well......... just too sweet.  I do love the breads and the pretzels.  I also love a good plain coffee roll, strudel, ect.  Not sweet but more on the flakey flavorful side of things.   So while I skipped the eclairs, kreme horns, ect I did try a coffee roll and a french baquette.  Let me say that it is the BEST french baquette I have had since I was in Europe.  Hands down.  The coffee roll was my breakfast the next morning and frankly I almost went right than to buy more of them. Yummo!  To top it off, the elderly lady in front of me ordered a loaf of sliced bread and then discovered she didn't have any cash or her check book and was embarrased to tears.  The owner GAVE her the bread.  Some might say 'big deal it was only 3 bucks" to which I say YES it is a big deal.   Kindness is always a big deal to me.  I will go back to this quirky kind place with great food.

This location of this small chain is easy to miss. It is in an older strip mall on the southeast corner of 43rd and W. Bell.  The selection is good, the prices are fair and the guys who hang out are alot of fun.  The 'Cigar Cronies' as I call them are mostly blue collar guys who are great to chat with while you enjoy your stogie.  I am partial to the Drew Estates Dirt cigars but my husband loves the Punches.  Occasionally one gets a cigar that has a bad wrap or is dry and there are no arguements about replacing it at no cost.  At this location, the customer is king.

Let me preface this review with this simple statement: I HATE going to the dentist. I don't mean I dislike it or it is unpleasant for me. I mean I really really HATE going to the dentist. I grew up with military dentists and if you grew up going to them you understand. Dr. Wood is very patient and considerate with people like me. He explains what he is doing and why. He also gives me laughing gas right after he finishes talking about what we are doing for that visit. That stuff is wonderful and makes going to the dentist so much easier. I have to also say that I refer to my teeth as 'the million dollar mouth' because of the amount of dental work I have had and still need. Dr. Wood did my most recent, but not last, crown. I have a mouth full of crowns and am on my second or third set for most of them so I have some experience with the procedure. The crown Dr. Wood put in is the best fitting, most natural looking crown I have. No gaps and the color is darn near a perfect match and I am not easy to match on color. It was also the least painless crown procedure I have ever had done and one of the most reasonably priced. Could I feel this way because of the gas? Maybe.....but I do think part of it was because of the Dr's skill. The staff is wonderful, Jill and Mary at the front desk are friendly and caring. Kathy is the hygienist and does a great job. These women are great and I almost feel sorry for the Dr when they start teasing him. Almost but not quite. If you are looking for a good dentist in this area, take a few minutes and check out Dr. Wood. You will be glad you did.

I first had Rita's when I lived on the east coast. I was excited to hear of one opening locally.  They have great ice's and custards.  This is a terrific place to go; the flavors are intense and ever changing.  Mix it up a little, try something new.  You won't regret it.
