What can I say about Comedor that hasn't already been said... The food is reasonably priced and the selection is huge. Back in the day before I started telecommuting, a margarita or beer paired with one of their daily specials have gotten me through more than one long assed afternoon at work (please don't tell my boss).  The wait staff is incredibly nice and watching newbies squint under the bright lights and bad south of the boarder art is always entertaining.  If you want to be a little bold, try one of their soups. They are scarrier than shit if you are a white girl that grew up on meat and potatoes, but they taste great (I just don't ask whats in it). LOL

I seriously don't know how this place rates a three star average. Just like many other reviewers, I really wanted to like this place. The concept is great! But that's it, it's just a concept. The food is as sterile as the environment. The only thing that distinguishes one dish from the other is the texture... each item has the same bland taste. And as I am somewhat of a foodie, the thing that is most amazing is that I know you have to work to make food this blah. The ingredients seem fresh, they seem to have herbies and such to make them look good, but everything tastes like they boiled it until all the flavor was released, removed the food and tossed the good flavored broth.  I suppose if one of your favorite food combinations is mayonaise on white bread you might be impressed, but IMHO save your money and take yourself anywhere else.  :)

Holy Mother of God! If you share your home with a four-footed creature, this place will be your new Disneyland! The owner of Halo turned me on to this place a couple of weeks ago and I finally made my trip over. It's not your typical shopping experience, so if you are faint hearted, don't even attempt it during the warmer months!  This place wholesales to pet stores and service providers, but as they are a locally owned and family run establishment, they open up their warehouse to the general public. Basically, you get to go rummage around their warehouse, along with their workers who are pulling huge orders, and fill up your basket or cart with anything you can imagine that is pet related (except for food). I mean good lord, I didn't even know they made facial scrub products for dogs and had no clue that they had specialty shampoos for red heads, blondes, and brunettes!!!  But let's take a tour of my cart: tennis ball squeaky bone - check chicken jerky  - check chicken rice balls - check odor eliminator candles - check happy bunny buffs - check (oh yeah these rock) window kitty bed - check case of greenie things - check remote controlled citronella training collar - check horribly embarrassing foo foo collar decoration - check  Here are few things you should know before you go: 1) There is a $25 minimum purchase (not sure if that is the same on line). 2) Every single one of their products is on their website or in their catalog and that is where you will find pricing info. 3) They have tiered pricing, so if you are buying one of an item, you will pay the highest amount. Each item has a "bulk" price which kicks in when you buy 3 to 12 of that item (depending on the product). 4) Prices ROCK, even the highest price is about 20% less than the big box pet stores and as much as 50% less than the boutiques. I went to look for a spray training collar (the non-shock kind) for my youngest dog and it was literally 60% less than the best price I could find anywhere else. 5) You have to put it together... if you are buying a crate or carrier, they will get it to your car, but  you have to assemble it yourself. 6) They have two full walls covered with clearance items that you will never see on line or in a catalogue. 7) This place is only open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., but phone and web orders can be picked up until 5:00 p.m. 8) The warehouse is cooled by coolers and was hotter than a son of a bitch when I was there. Industrial fans be damned... nothing is going to make you cooler - but a deal is a deal. Go in the cooler months and stock up, or shop on line.  http://www.ryanspet.com/ryanspet/default.asp?  The staff is INCREDIBLY nice (especially considering that they must be rattled by the heat during the summer). As you are wandering the aisles, they make sure you know they are there to answer questions, pull box, help you find a specific item, etc.  They also have a sharpening service in their sister building, where you can get your shears spiffed up for a reasonable price.  Seriously this place is a must go for anyone that feels compelled to spoil their four-footed companions. Let's just say that I was almost crushed when I broke out the bags and I didn't have to have a good cry on the way home for spending too much!

I've frequented Rito's since the late 80's, way before it was cool to drive down through the Garfield neighborhood. One of the only positive things about working in the financial services industry is that no one seems to care if you take a 2 hour lunch in order to make your way in to "the hood" for some really good food.  Lunch crowds are a mix of locals and lawyers, lined up shoulder to shoulder in a line that usually makes it way out the door. Take a dose of patience and a big appetite (oh and cash.... no plastic here).  My favorite: the red mix burro enchilada style.... just typing that phrase makes my jaw shudder hannibal lecter style.

Okay so I have to make a confession... Del Taco has some of the tastiest Chocolate Fudge Cake around. In addition to the nummy little thing being just the right amount for under $1.50, you can get it at 3:00 a.m. when there is no hope of finding such a treat elsewhere.  You will never catch me having a crispy shrimp taco (the idea of seafood from a fast food place makes me want to hack), but holy bajeebus... that cake is like crack!

If you can manuever the central / light rail madness this is the best copy center around.  I've had recurring print issues and they have consistently saved me from losing my mind.  I've gone in with flash drives, laptops, hard copies, brochures, etc., and they go out of their way to get me to class on time.  I haven't used the fedex services there, but if you need any kind of copy work done, please do yourself a favor and try this location.  FYI: They also have a small section of office supplies and I got the best stapler ever.  It powers through stacks with the ease of one finger touch.

Thankfully I'm not one of those individuals that are effected by the addition of MSG. Therefore I can enjoy my periodic visit to China Chili with no adverse reactions.   Quite a bit has already been covered on the expansive room, so I won't dive in to that. And most of my favorite dishes have already been covered in other's reviews so here are the ones that stand out in my mind (that haven't already been described at great length): * Chicken Corn Chowder - one of my favorite "I'm sick" meals. Think egg flower with minced chicken and corn. * Honey Walnut Prawns - not quite as good as Big Wongs, but damn good! * Pillow Chicken - minced chicken with a bunch of other crunchy good things, fried up mouth-sized dumpling style and blanketed in black pepper sauce -  yummo!  *Sichuan Style Green Beans - the menu version is made with pork, but I have them make it vegetarian with extra spice and IT IS TO DIE FOR.  I've never actually experienced the "frozen vegetables" that others have suffered, so I have to think that this is more anomaly than practice. They are always willing to alter dishes to my liking (more spice, no meat, different meat, etc.) - this is a HUGE plus in my book because I love spicy Chinese. The staff is Stevia sweet - meaning they are all naturally friendly! And drum role please.... I can call in my order, hop in the car, pick up my food, and get my chopsticks on in front of my own TV within 15 minutes! LOVE IT!!

I absolutely love this little spot! It's a great little known boutique with incredibly unique gift items that I don't have to drive clear out to Scottsdale to find. I've been shopping at Vignettes for about 8 years. Whenever I am in a quandary about what to get someone, this is the first place that I head to. Mostly it is because of the wide range of specialty items that they have on hand. Whether it's something for the garden, a gift for the new bride or baby, a unique piece of art, or heavenly scented candles - you will not be disappointed.  The owners / staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion / need. And they do the most amazing wrap jobs, making gift giving even easier.  The final bonus is their annual Clearance sale. For three days each year they basically blow out their stock to make way for new finds. Ask to be put on their mailing list to ensure your have a heads up and get there early because long time customers like myself never miss it. : )

My BIL introduced his haoles side of the family to this place. For years it was "plate lunch" this and "plate lunch" that, so I was more than happy to finally have a reference for all the SPAM based conversations.  Ono is friendly, crisp, and clean. They serve a mean Hawaiian BBQ Mix (BBQ Chicken, BBQ Beef & Kalbi Short Ribs) and Chicken Katsu (a breaded fillet served with... duh Katsu sauce). The soups are tasty and the macaroni salad that everyone references definately lives up to its reputation. Portions are large, so unless you want to take food home, get one of the mini-meals. It can get a little busy at lunch time, but service is amazingly quick.  The BIL swears this is the best plate lunch he has found off the island and goes to his happy place with each visit. If you are looking for a different kind of barbeque, try Ono on for size and you too can be hanging ten in no time flat.

Love Havana Cafe! I used to travel to Florida monthly for work and got a little spoiled (and addicted) by the great cuban food selection. HC isn't on par with some of those places, but it's darn good and it's the best Cuban food I've found in Phoenix.  The flavors are fresh and robust. Personal favorites are the Pollo Cubano (chicken marinated in citrus, onion, and lime), the Arroz con Pollo (chicken with safron rice, chorizo, and asparagus-with other yummy stuff), and the Paradise Pulled Pork (with onions, sweet peppers, and habaneros).  The Ropa Vieja and Cho Cho are good choices too, but they aren't my favorites.   My absolute favorite thing at Havana are the Completas. These are full meals for 4 to 6 people (depending on your appetite) that are packed up and waiting for you to take home and enjoy in comfort. There are several selections (http://www.havanacafe-az.com/recipes/index.php) priced between 29.95 and 34.95. Each meal comes with your choice of entree and  Moros (black beans & rice cooked together) Cuban Cabbage Salad Maduros (sweet, fried plantains) Freshly baked Cuban Bread Chocolate Bread or Rice Pudding  You can call anytime during the day and order up your choice with a pick up time. IT"S FREAKIN GREAT!!!  As others have mentioned, the mojitos are fabulous and luckily for us, they have been kind enough to publish their recipe http://www.havanacafe-az.com/recipes/index.php  Service at Havana can be a little slow, but that's very true to it's cuban roots. Food is an event in this culture and is to be relished... not rushed. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the gastric ride.

Bakers Nursery is hands down one of the best in the valley. Don Baker has been overseeing this operation for over 40 years. He is a major supporter of the local Master Gardener program, which is committed to educating the community on native plants of the sonoran desert or plants that will do well in this climate without being excessively needed.  The plants at this nursery are all either locally grown (which means that they won't immediately shrink back in to the earth when you replant them at home) or are grown in a climate that is similar. For anyone that has invested in plants, this is HUGE. Sure I love looking at the beauties at Home Depot, but unless you know what you are getting, they just wont make it in our oven of a climate here in the valley of the sun.  The staff is friendly and super knowledgable. If you have an idea of something that you would like (i.e.: I want something that flowers yellow from June through the frost season and will survive Southern exposure), they can lead you to the perfect plant. If you want some unique yard art, they have it. If you need to know why your bogenvilla has little black spots on the leaves, take a sample in and they will educate you on how to make it better. If you want something that they don't carry, ask and they will get it for you. I could go on and on with examples of incredible customer service. This place is simply the nirvana of gardening in Phoenix.  Another incredible service they offer is their website. They have a calender which is frequently updated. It will tell you everything from when to feed your citrus trees to the proper way to prune your rose bushes. The FAQ section will tell you how to get the white stuff off your clay pots, has a plethora of xeriscape resources for those of you looking to be more water conscious, and will help you with controlling pests in your garden. It's a great resource, and since it's local, the answers actually make sense for those of us that live here. Best of all... it's all FREE!!! http://www.bakernurseryaz.com/  If you are looking to spruce up your yard, do yourself a favor and head over to Bakers Nursery. Your plants will thank you!  ; )

Love the Hap's! For those times that I feel the need for some edible smokey goodness (as opposed to the brownie type), I almost always head over to Hap's Pit Barbeque. It could be because they are just down the road, but I do find myself craving their pulled pork sandwich or the KCS Ribs now and again.  Unlike the other Hap's location, this one is generally lacking the line, although it can get busy at lunch time. You can easily satisfy your bbq cravings for under 10$ a person, but samplers and slabs will run you a little more. They also have an okay selection beers and ales to wash it all down with.  Hap's is best known for a couple of items. 1) The KCS ribs are IMO the best you can get in the city. They are fall off the bone tender, full of meat, and spiced with the perfect amount of hickory smoke infusion and sauce. 2) The cornbread is cake-like and sinfully good (perfect for slopping up that extra sauce). 3) The pulled-pork is slap your momma good!!!  All of that is fine and dandy, but the best part of this location is the drive-through. I mean seriously, I can scrunchie the hair (yes I still wear scrunchies), pile my PJ'd self in the car and get all of this finger lickin goodness in a 10 minute turn-around trip from door to door. Where else am I going to satisfy that 8:45 p.m. need for bbq?!!  And if you are too lazy to go and get it, Hap's provides free delivery from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. for the following area:                     Glendale 67th Ave                           Central                    Van Buren  If you are hankering for some good down-home barbeque, then head over to Hap's on the westside and order you up a "Tub O' Tips" (seriously that is a menu item) and you should be shoutin' out "Sewie" Deliverance style faster than two shakes of a lambs tail.  http://www.hapsbbq.com/

Met the girls for drinks this weekend and we decided to brave the 115 degree heat to throw in some shopping. It could have been the heat, it could have been the excessive number of beers, but damn this place was way cool. The minute we walked in, it was clear that we had happened upon a shopper's sale nirvana!  To start with, there was a little table set up by the front door loaded with lemonade and cookies for those looking for someplace to escape the heat. But then as your eye wandered around your attention was quickly pulled into every direction by "sales" signs.   The girls and I did a once around the entire store, scoping out every nook and cranny, making mental note of what we wanted to pick up. This store is crammed full of the comfy home-touch stuff. From candles, sconces, vases, art, furniture, to kitchen foo-foos... you name it. Now granted some of it was a little kitchy for my taste, but the prices were rock bottom. And several of the girls were muttering about the perfect place to stock up that gift closest.  The staff was friendly and helpful. They offered to take items up to the register so they didn't have to be hauled around and even offered to check in the back to look for additional items.  If you are looking for a cool place to browse during the hot summer months head on up to Desert Ridge's Kirklands and spend a little coin.

Fast Eddie's is one of those places that you forget how good it is until you go back. The prices are dirt cheap and the food is consistent. Three of us can gorge ourselves at breakfast and walk away with a $20 check. The waitresses are all friendly (sort of like that one weird aunt that everyone has). Service can be a little slow if they are busy, so take a does of patience. They have a relatively large menu and you can order off either the breakfast or lunch/dinner as long as they are open... so if you have a hankering for killer buttermilk pancakes and bacon for dinner, it's there for the taking. In addition to their menu, they have daily specials (you know the drill - all you can eat fish Fridays, stuff like that).  The decor is a little cheesy - they bought out the inards of the long defunct Ed Debevicks, so they have the old "Eat at Ed's" signs all over. But the shakes are killer good and the pancakes are light and fluffy. What more could you want from your local dinner hang? Not much, unless you are like me and believe that a side of bacon makes everything better!

So the reality is that dentists terrify me. Panic inducing, brown paper bag breathing, Xanax requiring terror. In fact the only thing that used to scare me more than a dentist visit was the thought of losing all my teeth because I ignored them and having my lips do that little curl in thing. So not attractive!!!  Thankfully I have really good genes in the tooth department so my visits have had to be few and far between... just long enough for the memories to dull and for me to work up enough courage to give it one more go.  But here's the thing. My sister found this guy a few years ago and actually looks forward to going to see him. This oddity does not compute in my torture riddled memory bank. I couldn't comprehend the words of praise that would fall from her lips. So last year, in a desperate attempt to use up an HSA (which clearly I didn't understand the rules of use it or lose it), I sought out Dr. Bischoff.  The office and the staff couldn't be nicer. My skepticism invoked the "Hansel and Gretel effect," convincing me that awful things must happen behind sound proof doors and chambers of horror in the back. But neigh! When you are taken back everything is quite open. No doors to hide sinister activities. No panic driven, wild-eyed patients strapped to chairs. No scene recreations from a Saw movie. Just the opposite in fact. Bright and airy rooms adorned with the most amazing artwork (from Dr. B himself), with toe tapping music piped throughout.  I was a basket case on my first visit to Dr. Bischoff. On my last trip to the dentist I spent four hours in a chair, received 27 (count 'em - 27) shots of Novocaine, and then another 30 shots of slow release antibiotics along my entire gum line. I was so numb, I couldn't feel anything from just below my hairline to my shoulders. And I was a drooling bloody mess. Every single person in Dr. Bischoff's office was patient, kind, assuring, and comforting. They got that I was scared and they responded in a way that I couldn't help but relax.  I have since been back twice for procedures and am going back today for the final before moving in to a normal maintenance program. The difference is, today I'm not fretting about having to go in. I don't need to dose myself with some mind-numbing drug just to get in the door.  Simply put Dr. Bischoff and his staff are amazing. They did the same procedure that I had at the last dentist (scaling and deep root cleaning) with NO shots. None! And there was no pain. They use state of the art products and equipment. Numbing is done topically unless there is a severe case and the antibiotic shots were replaced with lasers that killed off the same bacteria, with no after-pain. The last time I had this done, I couldn't brush my teeth, drink, eat, or even really lay down without significant pain for almost five days. After my first visit here, I literally went right back to work.  All work is done in the office, so if you need something like a crown, you have it in around two hours. No more temporaries that don't fit and going back for multiple fittings. The convenience of that alone is huge! If you are like me and avoid dentists at all costs because of fear, please take a chance and let Dr. Bischoff try to help you.

This is quite possibly the worst branch of this bank in the entire city. I've been here several times due to its proximity to my work and have had a bad experience every single time. I have never seen more than two tellers working, there is always a line, their drive thru ATM is only accessible by the most unlikely of ways and causes huge backups in the parking lot... Literally I could go on for an hour. My trip today was no exception. I waited in the customer service line for over fifteen minutes to be told by the human I had purposely taken time out of my day to drive our of my way and ask for assistance that I should call the 800 number or try their online site. If I had wanted to do that, I would have. I lost my debit card and wanted to talk to a real-life, breathing, human being face to face. Really, you have no time to help me?!!

One could assume from the name that they only serve the needs of larger animals or those critters considered "un-domestic" (e.g.: horses, chickens, goats, etc.)... But au contraire!!  They have just about every brand of specialty dog and cat food imaginable... which just happens to comprise the bulk of my monthly grocery bill (ahem, yes I know I need a life)... but I digress.  Not only do they carry these foods, but their prices are SIGNIFICANTLY lower than some of the other specialty shops and something I would associate normally with big box stores. So when I can save $30 to $35 dollars off a bag of dog food that I was previously paying $105 for - well let's just say you have my attention!  They have the normal assortment of toys and treats for the little home bodies as well. It's not a huge selection, but very adequate. They also sell every imaginable vaccination for just about anything with four legs or the feathered two-legged variety.  Then we move on to the things I don't know nearly as much about. They have just about anything you would need if you owned horses, pigs, goats, chickens, ducks, rabbits, etc. And I'm not talking just the pens to corral them, or the food to keep them all happy, but the actual critters as well. If you go, make sure you go in to the back where they have the hatchery to see all the little ones. They are way too cute! One half of the main store seems to be dedicated to horses and tack, but I have never owned one, so I can't really speak to that.  Top this all off with their grooming services and this place is a virtual one stop destination for your pet needs!  Overall I have found that my fondness for The Stock Shop has increased with every single visit. The staff is friendly (i.e.: they always make me put down my bag of food so they can carry it out to the car), they have all the big box benefits but are small and personable, they make it a point to ensure you know that if they don't have it they will get it for you at no additional cost, and you are going to spend way less money for the same exact product!!  Love this place!

I love this place. I sit in the bar and as one other reviewer noted, there is always someone interesting there to start up a conversation. The burgers are top dawg, the condiment bar allows me to fulfill my jalepeno quota, the wings are perfection, and the drinks are reasonable.   When the weather is nice, grab a table outside. The service is a smidge slower, but the courtyard more than makes up for it. If the weather is warm settle in and enjoy whatever game they have playing (if you aren't seeing your team, just ask and they will happily turn at least one set for you).

This is another one of those little specialty gift stores that stock sets  apart. It is truly any plant lover's dream. They don't actually sell plants here except on rare occassion, but they have artisan fountains, organic plant foods, seeds that have been harvested right here (and are therefore pretty likely to flourish with the right care), cards / notebooks, and some of the harder to find gardening tools. All perfect for gift giving or when you feel like treating yourself to a new retracktable rake!  If you have ever tried to seriously grow plants in the Phoenix area, you have already figured out that our region has a unique set of obstablcle..... er, ummm, opportunities. This store is dedicated to providing you with the information and tools that you need to make this process as painless as possible. And while you are at it, why not make your garden feel like it is really an extension of your home with some personal touches.  Now you might think that because they are a specialty shop that the prices would be on the higher side, and although there is the occassional eye-brow lifting price tag, for the most part, items are reasonably marked considering that the majority of things are not mass produced and have been hand crafted by artisans. The staff are always friendly and helpful. If you don't see something, just ask and they will either get it for you or suggest other local options that may be fruitful (pun intended).  Remember to check out the bulletin board and counter by the register for upcoming events. They often host book signings, demonstrations, or lectures on... yeah you guessed it Southwestern Gardening. They also offer several different classes throughout the year that focus on the more artsy side of things, such as fused glass, silk painting, etc.  Southwest Gardener is located on the corner of Thomas and 15th Ave in a little strip mall right next door to the Original Hamburger Works.  http://www.southwestgardener.com/index.php

Grand Ave Produce Company is a family owned business that has been in operation in Phoenix since 1946. When they first opened, GAP was an open air fruit market. I can actually remember trips to the stand on Grand Avenue (hence the name) as a child. Mom and dad would pile us all in to the car and we would fill up these enormous boxes with all kinds of goodness. I can still recall the smells as we would walk through the mountains of fruits and vegetables. They have since grown to one of the largest distributors of fresh fruit and produce in the metropolitan area, delivering to over 900 businesses statewide.  In order to maintain their role in the overall community and stay connected to their roots (pun intended), GAP offers a farmers market on the first Saturday of each month from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  Each market offers the freshest produce and fruit at incredibly low prices, based on the season and availability. It is literally possible to buy an entire trunkload of the yummiest things for under $30! Last year I literally had to eat fresh pineapple three times a day for a week because they had them for $1/peice. Yes, I got a little overzealous, but thanks to GAP, I now have pineapple growing in  my garden!!!  Anyway I digress...  GAP can be a little difficult to find the first time you go, so just head South on 33rd Ave to Lewis (just three blocks South of Thomas), then hang a left. Give them a call on the Friday before the first Saturday to make sure the market will be open or to ask if there is something special you are looking for and want to check on whether or not it will be available.

I am so sorry to report that Grand Ave Product Company has at least temporarily suspended their Farmer's Market.   I headed over this morning to stock up on all the fresh essentials and the doors were down. : (   I called to verify and was told that although their website still reports that they are running the market on the first Saturday of each month, they have in fact stopped for the time being. Major Bummer!!!

I'm actually a pretty big fan of PGC. I was first treated to Mahmoud's culinary talent way back in the day (late 90's), when he owned the Green Leaf Cafe up on 19th Ave (where Fattoush is today). His current location is much nicer, but the food is still center stage. One critique that I've heard over the years is that people were expecting something different due to the name. PGC is not a Persian restaurant. It is however a place for great Vegetarian and healthy options that taste unbelievably decadent; flavored with spices and herbs that are typically associated with Persian cuisine.  The menu is quite large, with slight variances between lunch and dinner (dinner has more seafood and meat options - but honestly they let me order anything at anytime). There are always daily specials which are generally based on whatever Mahmoud finds at the daily market and items are clearly marked as Vegetarian, Vegan, or Carnivorous.  My biggest challenge at PGC is narrowing down the choices to a reasonable amount of food (which isn't easy because the portions can be quite large).  Some things that shine as stars on the menu: * the hummus - served with fresh veggies and house made nan * barley soup (when it is one of the daily soups) - this stuff is loaded with vegetables and barley * angel hair feta or spicy chicken garden salad - both are HUGE and crammed full of the most amazing organic vegetables found in phx, then lightly tossed in the house dressing that is crisp and brings out the flavors of every ingredient *purple shoots - asparagus and eggplant, topped with sautéed onions, garlic, scallion, tomatoes, fresh herbs, lemon juice and feta cheese *herb stew with chicken - I don't even know how to describe this one, but it truly rocks!  Most of the meals are served with brown and white basmati rice topped with a toasted almond-raisin-saffron mix, a homemade cugurt sauce and fresh nan. I could probably make a meal on this stuff alone.  PGC has a small selection of wines, but their flavored teas are so out of this world that I could float away on them. The peach tea is like none other that I have ever tried!  The only thing that I'm not a big fan of are the deserts - with the exception of the ginger and rose petal ice cream. If I'm going to splurge calories on desert, it's not going to be on a Vegan Cheesecake. But that ice cream... my mom and I split one and the first bite I took was weird and wonderful all at the same time - by the time we got to the bottom of the bowl we were having a spoon fight that required black-belt finger moves.  This is an unexpected little place that is relaxed and unpretentious while simultaneously offering table cloths and candles. It's not cheap, but they definitely make up for it in quality and large portions. Call ahead to check the schedule if you are interested in going on a night when they have belly dancing (usually the only time you need a reservation).

My home was built in the 40's and some of the trees were put in with the original landscaping. When I bought the house they had been ignored for a very long time and were in pretty rough shape so I spent several seasons just getting them back to a growing state. But the last two monsoon seasons made it abundantly obvious they needed some thinning to ensure that they didn't do any damage to either my house or the neighboring properties, so last September I brought in Artistic Arborist and had them assess what needed to be done to 5 of the trees. The owner Tim, came out to my home and provided a thorough report of what he believed should be done to each of the trees and gave me a per piece price as well as a combined discounted price based on the idea that they wouldn't have to send out a crew multiple times.  Initial sticker shock sent me looking for additional bids, but I quickly found out that Artistic Arborist's 34+ year reputation as the best was well earned. Every other Arborist charged between $150 and $250 nonrefundable assessment fees. Tim did his for free. Then reality hit as preliminary bids based on the details I provided about the trees, all came back higher (and in some cases much higher) than that given in the full report from AA. After several conversations I came to the conclusion that AA was actually reasonably priced and I simply had no clue about how much these types of services might cost. I was also impressed that all the other Arborist told me that they would not be responsible for any property damage and if I had anything under the trees that I wanted protected, I would have to move it myself. The office at AA specifically told me they would take care of everything and in fact I didn't need to do anything to prepare or even be home for the work, as long as they could access the trees.  We scheduled the work and when the crew arrived (two men and a huge truck) and I didn't see Tim anywhere I was worried. How these two guys would get all that work done and execute a job that was outlined by someone that wasn't even there made me really nervous, so I planted myself on the porch patio and watched. Within minutes I was actually filming because I was amazed. One man scampered up in the first tree and like Edward Scissorhands began sculpting the tree from the inside. Branches were either carefully lowered down or dropped in to a neat pile and the second man flew around the base of the tree gathering everything up and ran the mulcher. Seriously it was like a well choreographed dance. Before I knew it they were on to the second tree and just kept going. As they finished up the fourth tree and I could see they were discussing their approach to the mammoth eucalyptus in he back yard I saw a lot of head shaking so I knew something was up. They made some phone calls and soon my phone was ringing. It was the AA office letting me know that the team believed they needed a bucket truck in order to really do that tree well and they would have to come back on another day to finish that work.  When they came back to do that work I was even more impressed. Same two guys. Five straight hours of meticulous branch assessment and trimming. Huge branches carefully lowered down. Leaves raked and blown. Not only did the tree look amazing, but my yard actually looked better after they left, than before they got there.  I was really impressed with the work and so were my neighbors and family. As a master gardener I knew that you can't really tell how successful Arborist work is until the next growing season when you are able to see the new growth patterns, so I waited until now to write the review and determine my final rating. My trees look fantastic. The entire property looks different. One tree that I thought would have to be removed is thriving and I believe will make a full recovery. I simply don't have enough good things to say about Tim and his entire support staff. I literally felt like their main concern was that I was happy with the service/results and that is a work ethic that I find rarely. AA has since done great work at my parents home as well.  In retrospect, the hours that were spent on my property divided in to the price, combined with the results of the job led me to the realization that the work was really not expensive. In fact the two men that spent a total of 9+ hours climbing in my trees and doing some relatively dangerous work are not paid nearly enough... or at the very least, I have no future as an Arborist. If you have trees that you truly care about, make the investment and let someone that knows how and when to prune them do the work - call Artistic Arborist and let Tim and his crew take care of you!

This is my favorite 'bertos.  It doesn't hurt that it is conveniently located near my home and school, so I can have it coming or going.  The 24 hour service 365 days a year make this place a standout. It also doesn't hurt that the staff is super friendly and will happy take your 'when Harry me Sally' style order.  Prices are cheap and unlike others, I've never had an issue with slow drive through service.  The nachos are my favorite thing on the menu.  When they pass the bag to me it must weigh close to two pounds.  The clam shell could not hold one more ounce and if it were not for the extra red and green hot sauces that I always request because I like my food spicy, I swear that the lid would not have a chance of staying closed.  I also like the cheese enchiladas.  They aren't nice restaurant good but they aren't bad and a great choice for non-meat eaters.  My BIL loves the carne asada  here and I'm pretty sure he's tried just about every 'bertos in the city.  If you're in the area and you need a quick eat, this place is clean... the food is good... and the staff is friendly. Give Eribertos a try (even if it's at 3:30 in the morning).  :)

I'm a native to Phoenix, so I can't remember a time that MC's wasn't there. My earliest memories of the place are from when it was down on Thomas Road. In fact, my memories are so tightly interwoven with my experiences of MC that I may not be able to give a wholly objective review (but then come on... what review is every purely objective??).  My mom took me here the first time. It was one of those rare times that I had her all to myself. As we made our way in to the main seating area, I was pulled along by the signature pink striped wall paper. The portrait of MC herself, overseeing all that went on. My mom had told me that when she was a young girl that her favorite treat had been an old fashioned Cherry Soda with a float of vanilla... so of course that's what we shared. I wanted to experience what she had, so many years ago. When the drink was placed before us, Don Mclean's "American Pie" was wafting through the air and in that single moment I became a life-long fan.  Many things have changed since that first visit; owners, locations, etc., but one thing has stayed the same - MC's has been a part of our memories, our celebrations, our families, our history for over sixty years. I read a few weeks ago that unless something changes, MC's will close its doors in May 2011. For me that is something that should offer pause to everyone. It should be painful when we lose someplace that has been an institution to the trendy and chain.  I will be eating a lot of MC over the next few weeks... and not just the ice cream. The walnutty chicken salad is unparalleled, the just a little smokey ham salad (which I don't think is even served anywhere else in Phoenix), the not so full mixed salad with one scoop of everything wonderful, the house made chili. Toss in a couple of Green River's, Cherry Sodas, Hot Tin Roofs, or Cashew Achoos with mom and dad, and hopefully I will imprint enough memories to get me through a lifetime.  I for one will miss Mary Coyle's.

48 hours before they were to close their doors after 60 years, a long time patron has purchased MCs!  They will be shutting down for a couple of weeks for a much needed redo, but he will be back in business before the end of June 2011.  : )  Lavender Blue Dilly Dilly lives on!!!

Having gone through a period of time when I would have sworn that I was running a hospice for animals, I became intimately associated with Alta Vista. Seriously, how many people can walk in to a vets office, be recognized and acknowledged by their first name, and the techs all know the details of your animals BMs? I am convinced that I have put more than one vet in a new car!!! But ranting aside, they have almost always been professional and caring. I have had the odd off visit, but when you are on the frequent visit plan that is to be expected. Personal experience would rate a 4 star rating alone on the fact that they can muscle my chart around. But they get the coveted 5 stars for their mobile service.  Dad's very large (I would say obese, but that's a sore point, so let's say she was big boned) and very old yellow lab was frail and failing fast. We all knew what the humane thing to do was, but here's the rub... Libby hated going in the car. The folks at Alta Vista have an incredible mobile vet service which allowed the family to not force Libby's last moments to be worse than they already were. One call to the office and an appointment time was set. The vet came to the house (right on time) and spent a considerable amount of time with the family and Libby. She was allowed to pass comfortably, surrounded by those who loved her most.  If you are someone that has four-footed family members and find yourself in a situation where a more personal touch is needed, Alta Vista and their staff will definitely rise to the challenge.

This is the only place that my Japanese BIL will go for Chinese, outside of his own kitchen. The food is quite amazing, but the atmosphere leaves a little to be desired (explaining the four stars).  Their menu is HUGE and they don't just have your run of the mill Chinese. Although I've never been bold enough to try some of the more authentic dishes, I have seen some of the most amazing things come out of the kitchen! Whole fish flash fried and served up like filleted works of art, ducks with their heads on (ala A Christmas Story), vegetables that I don't know the names of, and platters of sizzling noodles topped with exotic sauces. Most dishes can be made to your liking if you are put off by spicy, but my preference is for the full flavored versions.  The dining area is one large room and is sometimes a little on the warm side. Take out can solve this, but I think you actually get more when you eat in, so I generally stay and take home the leftovers. Service is typically fast and always friendly as it is a family run establishment that even the kids are involved in. Portions are family style and although you can easily get away with a meal under 10$ per person, 12$ to 15$ will guarantee you a veritable feast!  I typically base my reviews of ethnic establishments on the percentage of patrons that share the same background and Big Wong's is a mainstay for the Asian community here in Phoenix. Next time you are in the area, stop in, order a poo poo platter (he he I said poo poo) and prepare for a feast of the sensations.

I have confirmed the rumors that Big Wong will be closing before the end of the year. The owners have been locked in to a lease they assumed for the last 15 years and with the down-turning economy aren't able to continue.  If you want a very reliable meal in a super friendly environment, rush on over before they close their doors forever.  : (

I'm upping my review one star for two reasons. #1 I just remembered that Mi Patio is a dedicated parter to KAET. Despite the long drive, they consistently donate food for 50 to 75 people during each of KAETs four yearly pledge drives. It's not often you find an establishment committed to the betterment of the entire community!  For that they get another star in my book.  The 2nd reason is service. It doesn't matter how busy this place is, you are always greated by a smile, served super fast, checked on throughout your meal, etc. They really do excel at service!

So as a native Phoenician, I grew up eating fry bread. But here's the deal... the only place you could get it was at the Arizona State Fair (And believe me, my folks would actually plan ASF trips for that very purpose!) or if the Heard had some special event.  What can be said of puffy little pockets of air and chewy goodness fried up in some hideously unhealthy concoction, thereby creating a crispy yum yum shell which you can top to your liking? Holy Mother of God my mouth is watering just thinking about it!  The people are friendly, the food is great, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the sauce should be nominated as a sixth food group in itself... foodies unite and to hell with diets!!!   The only downside to this place is that parking can be a nightmare (my sister went once and almost drove over someone napping on a parking block!) But seriously I wouldn't let that detain you from the food inside. : )  Whether you are looking for something veggie to carnivore or sweet and sticky the servings are generous. So put on your big girl pants, head on over to The Fry Bread House and pull up a chair.  love Love LOVE "The Fry Bread House"

Gabi's review got me jonesing for CJs so I headed back over for lunch. Maybe it's a middle age thing, but I always forgot how good they are in between visits.  Since I live close by, this is pretty much how CJs and I roll: 1) hit up website, 2) read entire menu 4 to 14 times, 3) pare down top 10 selections to 1 or 2 and call in order, 4) hop in car, and 5) return home 15 minutes later for a private pig out on the coffee table (so I have room to spread out). They do offer delivery, but it takes longer to get my feast on and I don't always need / want $15 of food.  Since it's all pretty much been said, let me just tell you the few things that make CJs a stand out: * I have never found one thing on their menu that I wouldn't order again.  * There is nothing that CJs feta doesn't make better... bring it! * I could eat my weight in their pitas and never tire of them. * The creamy greek dressing is 'lick your plate clean' to die for. * You will not find a better deal on baklava anywhere in the city (seriously it would be hard to get the ingredients for the price they charge).  If you are eating in, grab a cold beer or some wine to wash down your meal (and they are working on upgrading their liquor license, so they will have mixed drinks soon).  Don't let the location or the homey diner atmosphere fool you. This place serves up incredible food made from insanely fresh ingredients with flavors to match!

I inadvertantly went to the Washington location online menu tonight when I was trying to decide what to order and discovered that the prices at that location are between $1.50 and $2.00 more per item. I completely understand the need to have higher prices to cover the location costs, but am even more pleased that this location is closer to my home.

When you buy a home that is nearly 60 years old, you inherit a host of issues. There is always a leaky faucet, a drippy roof, a previously abandoned septic tank that you find by plunging in to the earth while trying to water your lawn, etc. As a result, you are forced to form a bond with home improvement stores that is tighter than Jessica Alba's ass.   I absolutely love rummaging through Walt's Ace Hardware. In fact, nine times out of ten, I will choose this place over one of the big box stores in a heartbeat. They have a surprisingly large amount of stock, despite their small stature. Yes, they might not have 52 plate covers to choose from for that bare outlet, but they will have 10 to choose from and quite honestly, there is probably one that will work just fine. The staff is unbelievably helpful and generally quite knowledgeable, offering up suggestions etc. Prices are competitive. And they even have freshly popped pop corn for $0.25 a bag to bolster your energy on the way home to tackle that next project. Other pluses are that parking is never an issue, you will never have to wait in the checkout line for a time period that is greater than the rest of your shopping excursion combined, they don't bug their eyes out at you if it appears that you just went spelunking in your back yard (mud and all), and you won't be accosted by out of work handymen on your way in or out.  If you are in the need for some home pick-me-ups, give Walt's a try and see if you don't agree that they improve the improvement process.

If you are someone that cooks at home, you might be less impressed with MMR, but even so, there are a few things on their menu that are standouts.  The turkey meal is really quite good and I like that you can choose the sides that are to your liking.  The chicken and dumpling soup is thick and creamy (and even a little addictive).  The first time that I saw it as one of the daily offerings, I asked what the server thought it was sort of funny when she told me that people will call about the daily selections and come in when this one is offered... now I am one of those people. During strawberry season, you cannot leave without having a slice of the strawberry pie. It is piled with fresh berries and covered in a mountain of freshly whipped cream.  Portions are large, so if you want pie consider taking a slice (1/4 of a pie) home with you.  The crust isn't the most tender, but the flavor is good and they generally have at least six flavors to choose from. Fruit fillings are made from scratch, so you are best off choosing something that is in season.  Hint: if you are going to buy two slices, it is actually just as cheap to get a whole pie.  I really do like this place for some of the more exceptional choices, the fact that they have a relatively extensive menu, and that they deliver.  Upping their rating to 4 stars.  :)

Between my parents and myself, we have pretty much eaten our way through the menu and because there are several items that I actually find myself craving, I thought I should update my review.  The veggie lo-mein is better than your average noodle. There are always a ton of fresh veggies (brocolli, carrots, onions, cauliflower, etc) with just a hint of smokiness to the noodles. Really quite wonderful.  The sesame chicken isn't like any I've ever had. It's really more like a honey glazed chicken, sprinkled with a few sesame seeds, but it is awesome. The chicken and vegetables is awesome and not over-dressed with gooey sauce. And all of the chicken dishes are made with all white meat, so you don't get that weird feeling half way through your meal that you are eating some sort of mystery ingredient.  They have two "family meal" options that are dirt cheap and for those of you that question whether or not you will have enough food for your family of 4 or 6, trust the guidelines and grab a big table because once the plates start arriving, you will need the room!  Although the original owners did sell about 1.5 years ago, the new family that took over is every bit as nice and dedicated to putting out good food for a decent price.  The last two bonuses are their huge delivery area and the fact that most items on the menu can be ordered as either an a la carte item (enough for 4 servings), as a meal (which comes with rice, egg roll, and crab puff), or in a bowl (with just rice).    The standouts on the menu, along with the super low prices and the flexability  for ordering just what you want, earns them an extra star!

I have been a customer here for years. And in fact I like Karl's so much, that I purposely don't go here. That might sound odd, but I have a weakness for some things. One of those things are apple fritters and fortunately/unfortunately Karl's literally makes THE BEST apple fritters in the world. Not only are they super moist (but not mushy) and filled with loads of apple chunks on the inside, they are super crispy and lovingly covered with the perfect amount of glaze on the outside. Now add to this to the fact that they are the size of a adult human head and you can see why I need to avoid the place. I could eat one of these every single day of my life and not get tired of them!   I have tried most of the more average bakery items at Karl's (the stuff you can get anywhere), but they have some items that are simply above and beyond what you find elsewhere and those are the things that make me come back time after time.  1) The Alligator - a huge flaky dough thing covered in nuts and a caramelized topping that makes you drool. It's big, so I take it to family events and there are never any leftovers. Poof. Gone. Ahhhh happy tummy.  2) The Apple Strudel - Karl's does the flaky puffed stuff proud and the filling is perfectly spiced. Another fabulous family meal treat!  3) The Season Fresh Fruit Tarts - Check out their FB page to see what the current offerings are and you won't be disappointed. There is a ton of fruity topping on these, so they have to be healthy right?!!  4) The Quiche - As the lovely Christina P. points out the crust at Karl's is really good. Great taste - perfect flaky bite - baked to just the right golden level. They usually have 2 or 3 fillings to pick from. Get there before lunch if you want to be guaranteed to find your favorite. Tip: this is another great thing to take to a brunch.   Family owned. Non-chain. Great selection. Uber friendly staff. Co-workers and family have all benefited from my relationship with Karl's. Stop in and pick up a sweet treat... just please please please, leave me one apple fritter! : )

Pure Heart Christian Fellowship is a great place for someone to explore their interest in spirituality or growing their faith.  Their mission statement is: "Pure Heart Christian Fellowship is a family of Christ followers committed to being a church where love is felt, lives are changed, the Holy Spirit is embraced and the world is engaged."  From the peaceful grounds surrounding the campus to the staff, this is a place that welcomes everyone regardless of where they are on their journey. The members are a mix of all backgrounds, many of whom left their previous churches because they were looking for someplace that felt more connected to their everyday struggles or experienced judgments that made them uncomfortable.  The services are contemporary and diverse. The pastoral staff is recognized throughout the nation as one that excels in bringing messages of relevance and importance to the community. And the greatest thing is that this is all done with a healthy dose of humor and relatability. There is seldom a week that I leave thinking that somehow the message had been directed solely to me.  One of my favorite things is their community outreach programs. Whether it be feeding the hungry, participating in habitat for humanity, handing out water during the summer, or providing free gift wrapping during the holidays, their sole aim is to let people know that they are not alone in life. Regardless of your interests there is a place for you to become involved in a community of caring individuals that believe if you are not part of making the world a better place, you are not living to your fullest potential.  I would encourage anyone looking for someplace that you can explore your own spiritual beliefs in a non-confrontational manner to check it out one weekend.  http://www.pureheart.org/index.php

So the first thing that might run through your mind when you stumble across this place might be, "how good can an italian restaurant be that shares a parking lot with a BAP Imports Auto Parts?" But don't let this strange little strip mall make you drive on by.  I first discovered Anzios when I was working in a corporate center near metro and was desperate for different lunch choices. My delight in discovering this little place was offset by the quick 5lbs that I put on after realizing my dream of eating lunch there 3 times a week.  The prices are great, the staff is friendly, the food is fabulous, the portions are decent, and the atmosphere is relaxed. This isn't one of those pretentious places that you go to be seen, but if you want really good food, you have found the right place.  Let me start by saying they have THE BEST garlic bread that I have had outside of little Italy in NYC. I'm not a huge fan of their Chicken Parm, but everything else is spot on. My favorite is their meal is their spaghetti dinner with tomato sauce and sauteed mushrooms. All dinners come with either homemade soup or a great salad and the bread that I mentioned above.  If you want to watch the game sit in the room with the bar and you will be able to root on your team while munching down on some of the best pizza and wings in town.  And if you want pure comfort food, order the Don Steak sandwhich. It's been a while since I've been to Philly, but this is an incredible version of the cities famous sandwhich (make sure to ask for sides of alfredo and red sauce) that is sure to please.  The desert menu is limited, but if you have any room after stuffing yourself with an entree, might I suggest one of there hot fudge sudaes. It is served on a hot brownie, topped with all the great googly moogly stuff and is big enough to share with three friends!  I love these little non-chain joints and anytime two people can have dinner, wine, and desert for around $40, it's a keeper.

Not really a review, but definately worth a mention!    Monday night pasta special: Spaghetti dinner with your choice of one topping. Served with either homemade soup or salad and that knee-knocking garlic toast. All for $8.50.  Seriously?!! I have to take over half of it home, so it easily makes two meals and in this economy that is a bargain for some yummy Italian eats!!

Oh yeah this place is way cool! Headed over here last week with mom and the sister. The thing that I liked the most was that it's a great mix of overstock and  discontinued items with scratch and dent. Each tag is clearly marked with why the item is in the outlet center - so if it was a floor model or return that has a ding, it tells you where to look. This can save you a lot of time if you are dealing with a really large peice.  The day I was there, most of the stock consisted of kitchen tables, entertainment sectionals, office furniture, and end tables. In addition to the remarkable woods that we all associate with Copenhagen, there were a number of glass and stone peices which really stood out.  The showroom is open from 9 to 6 on Monday through Saturday. The staff was very helpful, but not stalkish. And even though it was packed to the rafters with selections, there was room to manuever around, without that claustrophibic feeling that you can experience in some stores.  Although they only had three sofas displayed during our visit, I will definately be stopping by this place often as we were told that stock changes frequently.  If you are looking for higher quality furniture at rock bottom prices and are flexible with exacting styles, this is one of the best sources in the valley. Personally, I'm handy enough to deal with a knick here or there on the wood peices, but they lose .5 stars for those people that can't.  : )  --- big shout out to Jason W. for unearthing this little delight. I've lived in this area my entire life and had no clue that it was tucked away in there!!! ---

Don't judge me. I love this place. I love that I have to drive through the parking lot of the truck stop to get to it. I love that the same staff has been there for years and they remember you if you have come in more than twice in the last year. I love the 'tude of the place (yes even though it's a chain) and by all reason, it has no right to have an attitude. I love that the servers have to stand behind a little imaginary line on the floor and yell out the orders to the cooks. I love how the cooks don't actually have tickets to reference, but rather have to set up plates with their secret Waffle House codes to know what orders are up. I love that the hash-browns are made with one part potato and one part greasy stuff, then stuffed in to the perfectly round molds, so when they hit your plate they are like little crunchy hokey pucks. I love that you can get the all you can eat menu, if you simply can't decide whether you want a waffle, an omelet, grits, or a hamburger. I love that regardless of the time of day or night, you are guaranteed to see something that makes your inner teenager summon up your best valley girl "oh maw gawd!!" I love that they will let a  homeless guy sit at the end chair to get warm and have a pork chop. I love the weird collection of music on the jukebox and the fact that they actually have multiple WH mixed CDs. And most of all, I love that when you order a pecan waffle with extra pecans, they don't look at you oddly. They simply add as many pecans to the batter that will fit on the griddle and when they shut the lid, the nuts get toasted as the waffle cooks. I love this place.

Is this the best Italian Deli / Bakery that I've ever been to? No. Is this the best one in the Valley area? Absofrigginlutely!!!   This is the ONLY place that I know of in this metro area that you can select from eight varieties/brands of San Marzano Tomatoes. If you have to ask why that is significant enough to merit 5 stars... then I can only imagine that you haven't spent decades attempting to perfect your Pomodoro or Pizza Sauce.   Combine this with the fact that they almost always have Rainbow cookies available and some of the best fresh Italian breads, and you have achieved two-thirds of an almost idyllic Italian meal.   Before you leave the store, make sure you take a leisurely stroll along the back wall. This is what I like to consider a little piece of heaven on earth. Every imaginable cheese / meat you've ever heard uttered by the Mario's, Lydia's, and Giada's of this world can be found in the case that runs the entire length of the store. Want to create an out of this world antipasto selection for your next get together? Seriously if you can't find it in that case, you are trying to live up to Captain Jack Harkness standards, and although I adore him... he is a work of fiction!   And I have to agree with Nathan; they make one hell of a sandwich, but I've never sampled any of their other eat in/take out items, so my input is limited on that side of the house.   This is not a "pretty" place. It's not trendy or new and it is located in yet another strip mall. But it is a fully functional, family run, local business that is operated by two of the nicest guys you would ever want to meet. As far as quality and friendliness goes, this place rocks! I discovered Romanelli's about 25 years ago (remember... it's not polite to ask a girl's age) and let's just say, they had me at ciao. : )

Followed a Dr. that I respect to this practice and I have to say I'm pretty impressed. As a long time multi-four-footed caregiver, I have seen more than my share of veterinary clinics and animal hospitals. I know the drill and have seen more than one vacation be sucked in to the great black hole of "well of course I want  to have the best care".   The first thing I noticed is that there is NO odor. It doesn't smell like there have been decades of animals paraded through the doors that feel the need to pee as soon as they enter the room... just in case this is their one last shot at leaving something behind.   Then there is the overall feel of the place. The office I used to frequent always had a frenetic sort of feel to it. Files were lost, techs were running, the waiting room was packed with stressed out clients, etc. This office was peaceful. Whether is natural or contrived, I could care less. My dog picked up on it immediately and her normal "OMG what are we doing HERE?!!" behavior was replaced with something I've never witnessed in a vet office before. She was calm!   It's clean! Except for the area around me that was covered in the undercoat that Zoe was stress releasing, there were no traces of other animals.   The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. I had a HUGE file that I was bringing in and they patiently sorted through the entire thing. While I was there for one of my pets, the receptionist offered to set all of them in my household up for me with "Client Files" so that I wouldn't have to be bothered in the future. I thought that was a wonderful, time-saving offer and in the event that I ever have to go with an emergency and am not able to focus on paperwork.   Finally, I was in an examination room at the time of my appointment and waited less than 3 minutes for both the tech and the Dr. I was in an out under 1 hour and that my friends is superior service IMHO.   I look forward to a long relationship with Palm Glen and will happily drive the 5 mile difference from my old vet, in order to ensure both my pets and I are treated well!

I think my first visit to Santisi was in 1998, when it occupied the far south portion of the current space. It was a long, narrow shop run by two brothers that had relocated here from NYC. My friends and I would head over for lunch a couple of times a week because there was noone else ever there and it was the best NY style pizza anywhere near the office. The slices were huge, the cheese was just right, and the prices were cheap.  Well I guess we didn't really need to worry about them staying in business because it's 10 years later they have built one of the most amazing sports bars in the entire Phoenix area.  After acquiring the storefronts adjacent to them, they now have a spaceous location. If you like sports, and I mean any kind of sports, this is the place to head to for a group watch. They have over 60 screens throughout and if you don't see the match up that you are looking for, simply head over to the bar or alert your waiter/waitress and it will soon be up somewhere in the room. A couple of hints: 1) if you are going on a big game day, get there early - this place starts to actually rock with all the energy produced, and 2) if you are showing up with a big group, call ahead and reserve some tables - otherwise you may find yourself spread all over the bar.  The menu has grown substantially and now inlcudes several seafood options in addition to the standard pizza, pasta, and calzone offerings. When I visit, I usually get an order of wings (seriously the best in Phoenix) and a Mushroom and Cheese pie (because it's pretty close to one that I was addicted to in Manhattan), fold the peice up sammie style and let the grease drip down - YUMMO. Actually the only thing that I've ever had that wasn't pretty decent were the zeppelies. They are supposed to be delicate little fried, airy peices of dough dusted with powdered sugar, but these chew more like peices of bazooka.  They have a buffet at lunch, a dirt cheap HH, Poker tournies, trivia, a full service bar, reasonable prices on most of their food, and ummm have you ever seen 60 screens outside of Frys Electronics?!!  And for those of you interested in the softer sex, they have the Santisi version of Hooters girls, called.... you guessed it - Santisi Girls.  I have a feeling that if Tony and his gang would have looked for an alternative to the BadaBing, they might have opted for someplace just like this!

Taylor's Chowder House was established in the early 80's. Since then it has been a very popular spot for many relocated Bostonian's and other Easterners. A Southie ex-bf explained that a Chowder-head is a dolt or a stupid person and that you would have to be a big Chowder-head not to fall head over heals for Taylor's.  They are open for lunch and dinner in a very comfortable (albeit a little cheesy) environment for super great prices.  All meals start with hot fresh bread from Villa Deli with herbed garlic butter. This stuff Is so amazing that you could rub it all over your body!  As you can probably guess, Taylor's is known for their chowder. They make a good Manhattan (tomato based) chowder, but the New England style is what makes my mouth water. It's thick, creamy and stuffed with potatoes, onion and clams. This is the real thing!  They have the only selection of fresh shell fish that I know of in the Phoenix area. Clams, mussels, oysters, whatever your preference... they have something for you. The shrimps at Taylor's are from Guyamas, on the Sea of Cortez in Mexico. They are big, flavorful, and fresh.  Taylor's offers a large selection of daily specials in addition to their large standard menu. Specials are seasonal, based on what's fresh, but I have NEVER been disappointed. There are weekly specials as well - Smelt Mondays, Kids eat Free Tuesdays and Wednesdays are All You Can Eat Fish and Chips. On Sundays you can do brunch and the Build Your Own Frittata.  Most entrees can be prepared to your liking - broiled, blackened, or fried. There are also fried only options for calamari, Alaskan cod, shrimp, oysters or clams (fresh Ipswich belly clams - these are the really meaty ones). The batter on these is crisp and light - it is absolutely excellent and doesn't drip with oil. All entrees are served with your choice of sides, but I would highly recommend the cole slaw (it's great).  The have a handful of desserts to choose from, but honestly I have never had enough room to even try one so I can't comment on those.  : )  If you are looking for coastal freshness and quality, you may be a bit diappointed, but if you are looking for good seafood in this desert, try out Taylor's - I'm pretty sure you will be impressed.  p.s.  if you are a yankees fan, leave the your blues at home... this place is redsox all the way! : )

I've been going to this little pizza joint since the late 80's. It's a family owned spot that hasn't experienced much change since opening in 1974, except for the name (it started as a Pizza Inn). Somewhere along the way, LJ bought out the franchise and the legend of sauerkraut pizza was born. Yes I said sauerkraut! That's only one of very unique specialty pizzas on the menu (one of my personal favorites, along with the barbeque). In my nearly 20 years of making the occasional afternoon trek to Mesa from central Phoenix I have always been treated well by the wait staff (most of which have been there that entire time), have never been disappointed in the pizza, and usually look forward to the mini ice-cream cone served with every meal (except when I have returned to the buffet line one too many times).   If you are a first timer, I would suggest going for the lunch buffet served Monday through Friday from 11'ish to 3'ish or on Saturday evenings from 5 to 8. You get to sample every pie they make and if you don't see it on the serving line, just ask, they will have one made up just for you and deliver it straight to your table within 15 minutes.  As the other reviewers have stated, don't go for the decor, but the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. Speaking of comfy... take the big pants along, or make sure the ones you are wearing have an elastic waist. Don't head my warning and you may risk physical injury as overly tight pants are known to cut off critical blood flow to the remainder of the body.  : )

Robert's Catering has been a long time partner of our local PBS station, KAET. Both he and his staff are incredibly nice and go out of their way to make your event special and worry free.   Robert has a great list of main dishes, sides, and deserts for you to pick from but will also work with you on any special requests. And he is wonderful at making suggestions. At a recent Hawaiian themed event, the ever popular coconut shrimp was requested, but Robert made the suggestion that we try something a little different - a mahi mahi with an incredible light coconut and panko coating - to allow anyone with shell fish allergies to be able to enjoy the item. Everyone knows you can't serve fried foods on a buffet to just under 200 people right?! Wrong!!  This stuff was out of this world good. Crunchy on the outside and done to perfection on the inside! And as others have mentioned, his cakes are out of this world good, so just pick one.   Over the years I've had just about every single item that Robert has on his standards menu and it is literally some of the best catered food I've ever had! Robert's has been in business for over 25 years and has the routine down to a fine art. Next time you are in need of a little help, give them a call and I'm sure you will be very happy indeed!  : )

Update:  I decided to check a little further in to the rumors that Mickey's was closing up shop and found a couple of things...  1) They were finishing up repairs/updates as of my visits over the last two weeks, 2) They closed their doors on 07/31/2009 and put up a sign saying RIP, 3) the owner is searching for a buyer for this and his other spot in Scottsdale.  From what I can find, it doesn't even seem that the employee's knew they were shutting down.  Certainly nothing was said on either my visits over the last 10 or so days. Such a loss to the HH options in Scottsdale!  : (  __________________________________________________ The reporting of Mickey's demise was premature. It was in fact undergoing significant repairs and renovations (although I saw no major improvements during my visit two weeks ago).  It has re-opened and is back to its perfectly odd  and inviting self.  : )

If you are in serious need of a transformation, or just looking for a quick pick me up, Steven Paul is the place to go. Located in old town Scottsdale you might think that this place would be pretentious and snobby, but not so. And where else can you have your hair done by some of the best artist/technicians in the greater Phoenix area, get a massage - facial - mani/pedi, shop and have decent eats all under one roof? I mean the list of services provided here are seemingly endless.  The salon is more like a mini-mall of choices (at one point they even had dog grooming services and an unbelievable floral arranger - although I'm not sure that these services are still offered). Downstairs, they have the main service areas and reception; all beautifully pulled together with relaxing tones and great architectural pieces. There are oodles of service providers for you to choose from, each with their own specialties and styles. And each of their associates have their own price lists, so when you call to set up your appointment the salon can help you find someone that fits your style and your price range. The caf and Bizaar Bazaar are also downstairs. I'll get to the food later, but if you go, you must allow for a quick trip through the shop. There is an amazing collection of unique items and even better, they are mostly affordable and you don't have to worry about seeing your stuff coming and going.  The caf offers selections appropriate throughout the day and has some great daily specials. This is definitely not a four-course kind of place, but they offer lovely omelettes, sandwiches, salads, and standard coffee bar fair - all at very reasonable prices considering that you are a captive audience (especially if you have foil wrappers in your hair and another 30 minutes to process those hilights).  Personally I head up stairs to get my pampering in the private rooms (not to mention those bushy brows tamed or - and sit down for this - my nose hair waxed by an artist named Koltonn), where the atmosphere is more intimate and relaxed in comparison to the bustle and movement downstairs.  Years ago an old boss convinced me to take my long and straggly locks to the Hair God, Marc Reid, and I have been a loyal follower ever since. My heart literally skips a beat when I think back to the first time Marc cut and colored my hair. I had never seen myself like that before. He was able to give me the hair that as my mother likes to say "you should have been born with!" I literally LOVE getting my hair done. Marc's room is small and intimate, they great you with hugs, offer you wine or M&M's (whatever your taste), and are more than willing to run down to the caf if you have a hunker for something a little more substantial. I almost hate to do it, for fear that his client list will grow too large, but if you want to feel more beautiful than you thought possible, call mark (480)720.6272, and tell him Julie sent you. I love, Love, LOVE this man and can't thank him enough for the "perfect" cut and making everyone feel like they are truly special!!!  Either way, top floor or bottom, this salon won't disappoint! Start out with something small and I guarantee you, within a year you will planning out a full day every 6 to 8 weeks because frankly you're worth it!

I have a shopping problem.   By that I mean I will gravitate to the most extravagant thing in the room/section/department/store/mall... whatever. I have a shopping problem.   That being said there are a few things that I love and have accepted that will not change about me in the future without some sort of catastrophic or supernatural intervention.   1) The lovely gentleman, Walter Santiago, in the shoe department at this Nordy's will be able to retire early based on his sales to me alone. The man glanced at my feet, shod with shabby old shoes and definitively stated my size (correctly I might add). He then advised me against even trying one pair I was considering because he said their construction would not work well with my instep. Of course I ignored him because they were adorable, but when he brought them out he was right. They felt like anvils that had glass shard straps. Lesson one from Walter: if it doesn't feel fabulous... don't buy it!   Luckily this guy knows his stuff. Having the foresight that I would not be able to wear those toe torturing tools for more than 1 minute, he brought me 2 other similar choices, that because of their styling, would work on my feet. Not only that, they were styles that I hadn't even noticed amongst the bazillion shoes they have available, one was cheaper than my original selection, and it was so cute that it actually made me clap my hands in delight when I got them on. Lesson two from Walter: if you don't love it... don't buy it!   And so my relationship with Walter began as a love story and continues to grow. There are many other lessons, but you can find out for yourself. Just ask for him when you get to shoes and he will make you feel like you are the only one that matters. From boots, to ballet flats, reasonably priced to extravagant, the man has changed my life. Well at least the life of my feet. : )   2) There are so many other wonderful things about this store that I never would have known, had it not been for a friend that dragged me there (literally) a few years ago. The prices can actually be affordable. Their sales are amazing. Their service (web, return, etc.) is unmatched. The bra department has given my girls new lift. The live music makes me want to linger. They Valet. They hold your bags while you shop. I literally put the private sales in my calender so I don't miss them. I am already starting to vibrate with anticipation at the upcoming annual holiday party night. Well, I could just go on but you get the point.   If you are going to shop, try it. My feet and my girls are pretty sure you will like it.

My ex was 100% Irish and as the dutiful wife, I spent a lot of time learning the ins and outs of Irish Cooking. Well that relationship ended years ago, but my love affair with good Irish cuisine has never faded.   There are a few things on the menu that are a bit Americanized, however there are some stellar examples of this simple yet tasty food.  *As Kerstin M. says, their Boxty selections are always solid. The Beef and Guinness is wonderful, but the daily offerings are sure to please as well.  *The Bangers and Mash is a wonderful combination of their handmade Irish sausage with Ulster Champs (think lumpy mashed potatoes with green onion and herbs... one of my personal favorites).  *The Guinness and Onion Soup is fabulous. I crave this in the winter months and have actually tried substituting Guinness for Brandy when I make the stuff at home! It's a nice twist on the traditional French Onion; melty cheese dripping down over the sides of the crock. *Once I was there and they were serving traditional Colcannon which is mashed potatoes with kale or cabbage and some additional spices. I can't remember if this was around Halloween, but they had the little "prizes" inside and everything (thankfully the waiter warned us). But what fun!!!  Remember to get your fix of fresh Soda Bread and if you are like me, wash it all down with a couple of pints and Black and Tans!  I've actually held several work events here and as they aren't quite as busy for lunch, they are the perfect destination for something a little different (normally they don't take reservations, but I've never had a problem with calling ahead and making arrangements for my group).  Rula Bula has a few detractors, but I say to them Póg mo thóin! and sláinte as I order another round!!!

So when my friend Kevin and I are looking for a beer fix, this is usually where we head. They have decent deals on pitchers and oh so edible salsa (personally I like the hot version) but that is where the love affair ends. And even though we have gone to this spot several times, I wouldn't say that either one of us are fans. We go for the convenience.  I've tried several items on the menu and have to say I've never been particularly impressed with any of them. That's a nice way of saying I've never had anything here that wasn't done better somewhere else. I have spent years learning the nuances of what makes a good Mexican plate and if you are looking for something authentic, this wouldn't be my first choice. On the other hand if you are happy with an Americanized version and in need of cheap beer, definitely check it out!

Having survived a truly awful day, I found myself mindlessly running errands. Up on the right, I see the sign - Cerreta Candy Factory. Seriously my luck must be changing!  Cerreta's has been in operation for over 70 years in the bird and I was one of the lucky few that grew up close to their old location. I remember  tottaling through the aisles at my mothers apron strings and being mesmerized by the gigantic machines and huge vats of candies. It was like being in my own version of Willie Wonka (sans creepy blueberry girl and cowboy kid - ok I was always intrigued by the Oompa Loompa's, but I digress).  As an adult, I resurrected my relationship with Cerreta's when I found myself in need of "you can't find this everywhere" gifts for clients. The staff is super friendly, are always willing to answer questions and will throw together the most scrumptious gift baskets in no time flat.  Their chocolate doesn't rival Maison du Chocolat (but seriously nothing in this world compares to that standard), but it is decent and supporting a local business that has such a remarkable history is always a good thing.  Twenty minutes after entering a beaten woman, I re-emerged with a smile on my face, a spring in my step and one of Mr. C's Praline Patties hanging from my lips -- life is good!  Oh and before anyone jumps to conclusions of judgment, I checked and Cerreta's doesn't use any trans-fat in their products. Three cheers for healthy chocolate... ahem... well relatively speaking.  : )

Kiss the Cook is stellar in some ways and just misses the mark on others, which in my book rates it a solid four stars. I have been eating here since high-school and find this little family owned restaurant charming.  In addition to their regular menu (you can order breakfast or lunch any time), they always have three or four lovely specials. Generally, one is any omnivores dream, one takes fruit to a whole new level, and the other features one of their baked products done up to the nines.  My personal favorite is the "build your own" omelet. The ingredients are all super fresh, the omelet is always stuffed, and the house potatoes that are served on the side are very yummy (although I would like them done a little more on the crunchy side). My sisters favorite is the Snow Pea omelet. She swears it is the perfect combination of crunch and fluff!  Each meal starts out with a little basket of mini-muffin heaven. Alas the mini biscuits are no longer served, but man oh man are those zucchini muffins out of this world.  So you may be wondering, after all these raves, what are the down sides... well on occasion there is a little more butter on the bottom of the plate than I am comfortable with and although they are supposed to be famous, their sticky buns aren't all that special.  If you are looking for decent food, served with a smile, in a unique environment - you will definitely enjoy your visit to Kiss the Cook. Oh and there is that little chocolate kiss that leaves you wanting more...  : )

Jobing.com sits at the South end of Westgate, which is one of those places that makes you thank the lord for the night time because everything seems a little less out of place in this California Coastal type "mall" stuck in the middle of the desert. There is an array of restaurants (chainy although they may be) to suit most tastes and if you find yourself needing to score some extra points because it was pointed out to you during dinner that you don't bring me flowers, you can grab some from one of the vendors out by the central fountains. Clientele is a mix of extremes; so regardless of whether you are stuck forever in blue jeans or dressed to the nines and looking to share some of that brother love, you will fit right in.  First time visitors may find parking options and street navigation a little like driving Brooklyn roads without a map, but hell yeah the arena has a few people posted at the common entrances that are more than willing to try and answer questions.  Holly Holy this is actually a decent place to see a concert! Shocking as I am generally disappointed with the arena type venue. From the first beautiful noise to the last note, it was an evening that was definitely done too soon. The acoustics are solid and even the crunchy granola suite sitting next to us seemed comfortable in our side stage seats. Leg room is ample enough, which seems rare in this age of pack them in arenas and cup holders are within easy reach... all things that improve any venue by at least one star.  We picked up our tickets at Will Call as I'm a believer this is the only way to go. No fuss, no muss!  The crowd was well controlled and polite as far as concerts go. Long lines were well managed and although the air was electric with anticipation, there was a pretty amazing grace about all of the staffers, patiently keeping everyone moving toward their final destination. When asked if I was in line for the bar, a simple 'I am I said' retained my place without having to throw an elbow or smash a toe. When I reached the front of the line, a solitary man was serving up everything from cherry cherry Icee's to mixed drinks, which btw, I love on the rocks. One note, if you are purchasing a beverage that comes in a bottle; you might want to have them transfer the contents to a cup because they refuse to let you take the caps in to the arena itself... something about safety issues. I have to admit I found this a little odd, I mean what if I wanted to play me a round of the shell game to pass the time before the show started?  If you plan on being home before dark, you might want to avoid valet parking. Although this is a welcome service, the wait to retrieve your vehicle may make you cry out 'sweet caroline' is this line ever going to move or look for a man of god to give you last rights?!!  I mean cracklin' rose, it's not like we're crossing a border and coming to America, just get my car already!!   All in all, the night was great and I wouldn't hesitate to return to Jobing.com to take in a show.  ... now can you guess the show ...

Review #50 of a place befitting such a milestone!  My friend and I headed over here last weekend and as I was sure this place had to be more hype than substance, I was a little trepidatous about the visit. Seriously I couldn't have been more wrong!!! So much so, that since we were there on a Sunday, or visit extended from the Brunch specials, right through to the beginning of FEZ Foodies (in other words I had to leave a HUMONGO tip because we took up real-estate for so long!).  As there have been a bazillion reviews already, let me just say a few things: 1)   Fabulous service 2)   One of the best burgers I've ever eaten 3)   Hot Brownie topped with the perfect Vanilla scoop - served so hot and steamy that if I weren't afraid of burning my skin, I would have covered my body with the stuff just to be closer to its goodness!  Can't wait to check out their nightly drink specials (I'm already anticipating having to introduce myself as... "hi my name is Julie and I'm a half price margarita addict").

Having fought our way through the Home and Garden show downtown, both mom and I were feeling the need for some sustenance. Since we had just spent the last two hours beating salespeople off with our virtually empty flier and give-away bags, I thought I should let mom pick the spot. But as we were driving up Central, the car just sort of veered to the right and thankfully I heard mom say, oh this is that FEZ place that you talk about!  At first I thought maybe mom would feel a little self-conscious but after promptly being seated, she leaned over and said "I like this space". Whew! Big sigh of relief!! Mom was immediately drawn to the brunch menu which is available on Saturday and Sunday, as was I. We settled on the Breakfast Kisra , FEZ Benedict, and Peach Bellini's.  The place was actually packed, but service was quite attentive (Thomas even brought out our food... I almost became giddy). The food was wonderful, the drinks were fabulous, and by the time we licked our plates clean,  mom had already decided what she wanted on her next visit.  Finding a place that is parent friendly, while simultaneously serving mid-morning cocktails definitely warrants the sustained five-stars!!! Thank you FEZ for another fabulous meal!

I'm a big fan of this this family owned spot.  They are always super friendly and will recognize you as a "regular" by your second visit.  The food is fresh tasting and everything I've had on their rather extensive menu is great.  They have the big grill, so you can either "create your own bowl" of goodness, piled high with a huge variety of fresh veggies and your choice of protein / sauces, or you can pick one of their menu favorites.  The space is fairly well lit for this type of establishment and is always clean and tidy.  The decor is sparten but the food is good enough to rise above the atmosphere.  Or have them pack all of your goodness up and take your food on the road.  Either way you will have a great meal for a decent price and still have enough left for another meal.  Mu Shu is everything a family owned restaurant should be topped off with a fortune cookie. :)

The bbq here is pretty good, but that has been documented well by others. My favorite thing on the menu is actually the fried chicken. It's a HUGE boneless breast that is breaded in a yummy coating and although it is fried, it is not a big greasy blob. It comes with two sides, but they suggest one be the mashed potatoes and gravy. The mash is really quite good. There is a hint of spice in there that is unexpected and nice.  My only gripe is that they serve the gravy on top of the fried chicken and I have never understood why you would drench something crispy in anything that is going to eventually turn everything to a gooey mess.  The flavor is great. Just put it on the side.  The free donuts are a nice touch, but nothing special, so save the calories and get the banana pie/pudding thing. The crust is made of crushed nuts, which is then topped with a substantial layer of bannana pudding. All of this is then topped with carmelized bananas and drizzled in carmel. YUMMO!!  And if you like their macaroni and cheese (which IMHO) is heavenly cheesy goodness, skip it as a side and order a quart to go instead.  You will get about 8 to 10 side servings for around $6.50 and that is a HUGE savings over the sides price.  Put your walking shoes on for the hike you will need to burn off the calories and just know going in that you have to through your diet out the window for one good meal.

Took the mom and sister here for a cool down today and WOW! I had the Vesuvio, which had the ability to literally fill my mouth with flavor bursting from each little paddle full of goodness. Thankfully I chose the single scoop, because honestly it was so rich that I probably  would have gone in to an embarrassing moaning fest if there had been any more in my cup. Mom had the Light Mint Chip - a refreshing choice on such a hot summer day. Sister brazenly went for two scoops of Caffe Espresso paired with Chocolate.  Other than the much discussed PITA parking situation complements of LGO, there was not a single deterrent from the perfection of this experience.

Having made my second trip to the Cox office in less than one week (Lucky's new favorite chew toys are the cable remotes!), I felt the need for some bolstering. Thoughts of Gelato swirled through my mind and I remembered that there was a little spot right across the street. I had been on marathon calls since 5:30 a.m. and was sluggish, so I thought I would grab an early dinner of Latte and Gelato to go (please don't judge me; I believe every girl deserves to have a dinner comprised of only Gelato every now and again).  I was greeted by three very friendly staffers before both feet were in the place. A lot has been written about the décor so I won't spend any time on that, but I will second the WiFi accolades from Brad B. (and I actually like having the power-strip as I don't like being confined by my battery life). Honestly I don't need squishy couches and quality decor, I have that at home - I just need to be able to connect and spread out a little!  I ordered the largest Vanilla Skim Iced Latte they would serve (it was hot out). And then it happened... Dark roast or light? With the seemingly simple utterance of these four little words, the worries and stress of the day melted away and I was instantly transported back in time...  When I was seventeen, my mom and dad gave me the ultimate graduation gift - they sent me to Europe with some friends and gave me an American Express card! My fondest memories of Rome were sitting on the Spanish Steps, sipping on my very first Lattes and eating Gelato with the most adorable little shovels. I can still remember the feeling of the warm sun on my legs, the cool breeze carrying enticing aromas, the sounds of people bustling up and down the stairs... and the boys - those beautiful black-eyed boys with wavy hair and Cannes smiles! One of those boys took me to a coffee shop just at the base of those stairs and it was there that I had my first real coffee. They always asked if I wanted a dark or light roast and since the barista suggested a dark roast would be more "mouthy or full tasting", that is the benchmark that was set. Not since that summer have I ever been given the option of roast on a latte unless I forced it.  Next I moved over to the Gelato/Sorbetto counter. There were at least 20 mouth-watering flavors on display. Each one pristinely smoothed in to their little icy beds. I chose the Signature Espresso and Arriba Dark Chocolate. The mix master advised me that the Espresso tended to be a little on the icy side and he didn't want me to be disappointed. I was appreciative of his warning but pressed on. He handed me my cup with a color coordinated shovel and my return to the steps was at hand!  The result was a perfect blend of flavor and texture. The Espresso had flaky crystalline like structures which reminded me of mica. I could pull a few of the crystal layers out, swirl in some of the rich creamy chocolate and create the perfect bite each and every time.  I am sad to say that I was so focused on my purpose that I had no clue they sold pastries and food. But for their ability to take me back to that perfect Vespa summer, eating Gelato and sipping Latte in girlish skirts and flip-flops, I have no doubt that I will be back! Oh to be seventeen again...

Pie Zanos Kithen is one of my favorite lunch spots. The space itself is warm, open, and inviting. It can be a little crowded at noon, but if you arrive by 11 or after 1, you shouldn't have much of a wait.  Every single time you enter the building, you will be greated by the absolute nicest people. They genuinely enjoy their work and it shows!  The menu can be a little overwhelming at first, but simply check out their website to familiarize yourself with the concept of (build your own pizza or salad) and you will be good to go. The staff will also walk you through your choices if you indicate that you haven't been there before. http://www.piezanoskitchen.com/default.asp  My two favorite items are: 1) the Greek Pizza (Pesto, Feta, Gyros Meat,  Red Onion, Kalamata Olives, and a Garlic Crust) with the addition of fresh mushrooms - seriously good eating right there on that little pizza pan. 2) The House Salad with a choice of cheese, four veggies, and choice of dressing -- sounds simple, but they don't have your run of the mill veggies to choose from and you can make some tantalizing combinations if you get creative!  The Bo Diddley pizza is yummo also, but one of my two favorites usually wins out in the ordering process.  I've never been here for breakfast, but the menu looks great and if the quality of lunches is any indications, I would imagine that their Fritattas and Espresso are finger lickin' good.  Happy Hour is daily from 4:00 to 7:00 p.m. and as mentioned by some other reviewers they do have live entertainment options throughout the week.  PZK was voted New Times Best New Restaurant of 2005 in the Phoenix area and they have definately kept up the good vibe!

Recently decided to spiff up the patio and backyard. Also found myself in need of a different kind of gift, so I headed straight off to Figs. I sort of have a love / hate thing with Figs. It's true, they do have a fairly unique set of products; great architectual peices mixed with the finer details of decor. Themes that range from country to Asian, kitchy to refined. But all this variety comes at a price.   The store is crammed full and isn't easily shopped. Aisles snake around like a Disneyland ride in the middle of summer but here you don't get the benefit of the little signs that countdown the time you have left and some of these journeys actually dead-end whereas at the park you at least have Mr. Toad's Wild Ride ready to whisk you away. Walls are filled from floor to ceiling with artwork and if you have even a hint of OCD you will be driven to straighten that one way up at the top that hangs a little to the left! And what is up with all the paintings of those freaky monkeys in hats?!! I swear their little monkey eyes follow you around the store and well, that's just downright creepy!  When all was said and done, I walked away with my gift; a metal pig that could double as an anvel (because of its weight), a few peices to place around the patio, and had a great conversation with some of the staff. Figs is the perfect place to fill your mind with possibilities and they would definately rate the coveted five-stars if it weren't for the navigation difficulties.

Honestly the best part of this place is the unbelievable deal you can get on pet related products. Because they are one of the primary income sources for HALO Animal Rescue, people that have pets, tend to make donations. You can almost always find pet carriers for under $10. They have dog crates for training and you don't have to shell out a fortune for them. They have fish tanks that will allow you to let little Johnny get his feet wet in the world of pet care and the associated responsibilities without breaking the bank. If you are a person that shares your life with animals, you understand the rarity of these kinds of deals!  Yes they have clothes, furniture, tchatchkies, etc., but the real deals are on the pet products.  As a side note, HALO recently leased the MCCAC location at 5231 North 35th Avenue (It was the previous Maricopa County run cat adoption center). So if you are looking for a companion (cat or dog), check them out and support one of the fastest growing no-kill efforts in the US. http://www.halorescue.org/index.html

This place is great! I took my mom before a play and we didn't experience any of the slow service that others mentioned. The food was unique and tasty. We each picked a pasty of our choice and then split the mushy peas and roasted potatoes. Top it off with tapped hard cider and I was in oral heaven.  There was far too much food for two people to eat in one sitting. These little sandwiches are deceptively filling. And the incredible number of options from which to select from is a little mind boggling. My suggestion would be just to settle on one and then figure on a few return visits to round out the list.  Tables are tight, so this is definitely not a place to take the whole posse, but that's not a huge down-grade. The music is fairly loud and as I mentioned, I was there early, so I can only imagine that it must get really loud when the place is full. Amazingly, mom commented that she liked the music (who knew she was a Green Day fan) and thought the atmosphere was charming (not how I would have described it, but clearly its a place that is even parent friendly). She already has picked out her next two choices for return visits...  A couple of things that really stood out to me: 1) You can get the Oggie (the basic pasty) partially cooked for a buck less than the menu price - then take it home and finish off the baking for that fresh out of the oven taste - very cool. 2) If you want desert, you have to order it first or share food, because there is no way to finish everything - sammie and side - and still want for more. 3) I've spent a lot of time in the mother land and don't remember the food every being this flavorful... but who really cares, this is good eats and did I mention the tapped hard cider?? (takes me to my happy place)!  This is a great unique food alternative for the down town Tempe area.

I like Feeney's. I must because I have been eating there for over 10 years. I like the owner of Feeney's (partially because his name is so much fun to say - Elias Pantazopoulos - but he will answer to Louie). Over the years, there have been very few times that Louie hasn't stopped by our table to make sure everything was ok. And although I would like to think it's because I'm special... it's really not. He genuinely cares about the people that come to his establishment and wants them to feel comfortable expressing their likes or suggestions.  This place is small and mostly dark (the perfect place for a quiet dinner with your someone special) without one iota of pretentiousness. The brick walls, archways, and dark wood accents give it a little bit of an East coast feel topped off with the tiled exhibition kitchen complete with a shiney copper hood.  The menu is mostly comprised of great steaks and sea food, but there are always a large selection of daily specials that are sure to mix things up. Most meals come with a trip to the salad bar... but beware, portions are pretty large, so make sure not to overload before your meal ever arrives. They have a full service bar up in front and if you are looking for a different game venue, grab a seat in there. The drinks are very reasonably priced, strong, and never run dry. They also have a hearty list of apps that you can supplement your drinks with, for the perfect game day fix.  If you haven't over-indulged with your meal, you MUST order the Mud Pie. It is a ginormous slab of goodness! Dark chocolate cookie crust, loaded with coffee ice cream and topped with a super fudgy ganache layer that you will want to rub all over your body.  Feeney's is a genuine rarity. It's a great little steakhouse that serves up above average meat but doesn't have a foo-foo bone in its body. Call ahead to make sure they have a table and head over to Feeney's. Oh and as Laura B. mentions, they are on restaurant.com so you can get a great deal on any meal.  I have to go now... there is a piece of pie calling my name!

Liked it when it was Cafe Del Sol, like it as Fuego Bistro! When my BFF (aka Sisterwife) and I want some down home comfort food escape from work, this is were we head. We've enjoyed everything ordered to varying degrees... Sopas - yum, Empanadas - yum, Frita Cubano (their hamburger) - yum, Panini Cubano - yum, Pan con Pernil Asado (pulled pork with red cabbage) - yum, Pan con Ropa Vieja - yum yum, Pan con Bistec (OMG the bleu cheese is perfection) - yum yum yum. In fact the only thing that has ever left me wanting for more on the lunch menu has been the Quiche de Espinaca... it was good, just not OMG good like the rest.  If you go for dinner, get the Southwest Crab Cakes and regardless of when you go or  what you get, leave room for desert. Or be really naughty and just get desert! They are all sinful and totally worth the calories!!!  Service is typically quite good. If you go when it isn't fire truck'n hot, sit outside and enjoy the lovely patio. It's less claustrophobic than the intimate interior and has a more relaxed feeling. And if you go on Friday or Saturday nights, they have some great live jazz to spice things up even more.   One last thing that I beleive makes them unique is that in addition to normal catering services, they will do mid-week business lunches. For anyone that has to pull together meal options for meetings, this is one sure hit!

I am a second generation Garcia's Las Avenidas patron, as my folks frequented the little taco stand down the street that started the whole thing. I swear instead of a pacifier, my mom put a Garcia's shredded beef taco in my mouth, and its been love ever since.  This is hands down one of my favorite places to get Mexican food and I love that the family has stuck to their roots even as the neighborhood has changed drastically over the years. The staff is friendly and consistent (in other words - go often - and you get treated like family).  I would offer up suggestions for the best menu items, but truthfully I LOVE IT ALL.  Everything is made fresh on-site so quality has never been a question. One thing I would add to Kristin's review is that if you are looking for a deal, the prices at the Take Out center are about 1$ cheaper per item. The only down side is that you can't order Margaritas to go, so if you want one, drink it down while you are waiting for your order to come up.  Since I live about 10 minutes from the location, I usually hop in my car, hit my speed dial to order, and depending on whether or not there are a lot of cars in the drive thru line, cruise right on in to grab my food and go.    Portions are pretty large, so if you are ordering a two item combo or one of their dinners, plan on leftovers. But where else can you get two meals with chips & salsa for around 10 to 12 bucks??  Oh and did I mention the Fried Ice Cream? Messy as all get out, but OMG is it good!!!

If you like to wander through other people's treasures and ponder where things came from, this place is the biggity bomb! My mom, sister, and I stopped in and literally spent two hours. Now that might not sound earth shattering, but the place isn't gigantic; it's just packed to the rafters with finds from all over. In speaking to the very friendly clerk, she advised me that there are some vendor spots scattered throughout the store, but that the vast majority of items literally come from estate sales that Michael buys out.   The prices are VERY reasonable and they literally have a little bit of everything - from high end designer pieces to knock offs that will give you pause. Each one of us found things we couldn't live without and I was even able to finish some of my holiday shopping for the "impossible" to please family.   This place is definitely being added to my list of go to places because I'm sure their stock changes frequently.   So what could possibly earn a used item store a 5-star rating?  1) Ask if they are having specials. When we were there, certain types of items were all on sale and since we were each buying armfuls, they applied a further discount on top of the total price!  2) This place doesn't have even a hint of that Goodwill/Savers smell that makes you want to breathe through your mouth. Quite the contrary, they had some lovely scented candles for sale and had samples burning throughout the store.   Seriously, what more could any bargain shopper want?!!!

: ( Sadly the economy has taken this one from us. There is another re-incarnation there each weekend, but it has a different focus. MT Estate Treasures will be missed from Central Phoenix. There website lists two east valley retail spots, so if you are looking for their unique finds, give them a call and get current details.

This is hands down the best breakfast place in town. They do a super lunch and dinner as well, but I usually can't get off the breakfast selections. The "California Omelette" (Avocados, Mushrooms, and Jack Cheese) is superb, as is "The Volcano" which is made up of three fluffy / yummy pancakes, sausage, bacon, and eggs.   As other reviewers have noted, portions are ginormous. Go planning to share a selection or take at least another meal home with you. There can be a wait on the weekend, but once you get seated, service is prompt and attentive. (Albeit the Fuzzie Bear that walks around can get a little creepy around the fourth table pass).  BBD is supposed to be known for their desserts and they do look good, but the blackberry pie that I took home was more than a little tart and the crust was on the tough side. I wouldn't let this stop you from sampling as it could have been an isolated experience based on their reputation.  There are actually a few locations in the Phoenix area, so visit their website to see which one is closest to you. http://www.blackbeardiner.com/  This definately isn't your parent's Denny's!

Finally made my way to Fattoush and I have to say "mmm mmmm good!" Not since my old neighbor, a refugee from Iraq, moved out have I had I experienced such robust flavors combined with healthy food. Lord I miss that man!!!  So yeah there isn't much of an atmosphere, the pictures don't really fit in the molding that was hung to frame art, but does that effect the food? Absolutely not! Physically, not much has changed since this place was the Green Leaf Cafe which was the predecessor to the Persian Garden. Except that the food here is less on the fusion side of Mediterranean flavors and more middle-eastern authentic Iraqis with a little Jordanian thrown in.  I love that you start out with the green lentil soup or salad with every meal. The name of the restaurant actually comes from said salad, which is a mix of romaine, tomatoes, cucumber, mint and toasted triangles of pita bread, covered with a tart balsamic vinegar dressing. But the soup is where it's at. It's unlike your average lentil soup - smooth and creamy, with bits of pasta. Very mild. It's a nice homey touch which is really what this food is all about. And that homey touch comes naturally, as the two main staffers are brother and sister. Their mom often helps out in the kitchen (and dad is busy cooking in Scottsdale).  When we arrived there were just two tables with guests, so we had our pick of eating spots. And there were a steady stream of people coming in for take-out throughout our visit.   The menu is actually quite large considering their kitchen is about the size of my bathroom. On this visit, my sis and I decided to sample as much as we could to get a feel for the place. She was a little iffy as she had never had this kind of food, but once the dishes started rolling out, she quickly became a fan. We started with the fava beans, mixed with olive oil, garlic, and lemon. Main courses consisted of the Falafel Plate which comes with warm pita, hummus, pickles, and tomatoes and Chicken Shwarmas which were spiced perfectly and had juicy - dare I say succulent chicken. We topped the meal off with some freshly made baklava and rolled our way out to the car for our trip home.  Just after the soup course, a large Ford taxi pulled up and out of it piled out 8 full grown (some more fully grown if you get my drift, than others) ME men. It was sort of like the proverbial clown car... I mean seriously I didn't know you could get that many men in one car. They headed straight for the table next to us and then things really started to pick up. Four of them ordered Lamb Kuzi and the rest all got something different. Let me just say that my sister had to hold me down because their food all looked so good. Their table was literally crammed full of dishes with smells so good that I swear my nose grew just trying to get a better whiff!  Our meal came to $25  but in retrospect, we really didn't need all three dishes and could have easily gotten out of there for about $16. Service was attentive, food was phenomenal (and healthy - how often do you find that?!!), and it's only .5 miles from my house. This is probably the best ME food that I've had at a local restaurant and the place would definately warrant the coveted 5-stars on the food alone, but the afore mentioned atmosphere knocks it down one. It may have taken me years to get over to Fattoush, but it won't be long before my next visit! That Kuzi is calling me!!!

Having grown up in this neighborhood, I've been going to Bill Johnson's for decades. One of my fondest childhood memories are the late night visits after the Phoenix Roadrunner games for Deep Dish Apple Pie. In fact, I would probably have to say that getting a personal pie the size of my head, topped with ice cream is what started my love affair with food!  BJs is consistent. Their hamburgers are tasty, their fries are crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside, their ribs are fall of the bone good, and their chicken fried steak rivels my moms.  The wait staff is attentive and conscientious as drinks are seldom allowed to get below the halfway mark. All in all its a friendly place that is good for families and singles alike.

I needed a compounding pharmacy and started checking around to see if there were any near my home. Luckily I remembered there was an independent not far away and was super psyched to find out they met my needs.  As others stated it is way cute inside. Warm and welcoming feeling, which is a nice change from the sterile environments one usually finds in a pharmacy.  Although two others were being assisted, I didn't have to wait more than one minute for someone to come assist me.  The tech explained that I could order up to three months of the compounded medication and with each additional month, there would be a price cut. I  never would have expected this and was very pleased to find out the discount.  I was so pleased with my business, I asked about transferring my prescriptions from a local big box.  This led to my tech telling me about a new service they have where they actually package up your meds in tear off packets to help you keep track and make sure that you are taking all of your medications at the proper time (e.g., breakfast meds are all packaged together, lunch meds, etc.).  They are all sealed in these little grab and go packs, so rather than getting multiple bottles for scripts, you get one box and just start on the appropriate day and time.  It is the most awesome thing! No more wondering if I took something in the morning, or taking two because I didn't remember taking one before.  I'm very impressed.  Prices are on par with the larger chains and the service is personal, caring, and actually feels like they want to help you.  Bigger is not always better. Go to Melrose Pharmacy and see it for yourself.

I was referred to Dr. Stacey Hoffman and Vet Care Internal Medicine Specialists when three other local vets had unsuccessful results with treating a respiratory issue in my chow chow.   Over the period of 9 months she underwent several rounds of various medications, had a bronchoscopy, tracheal and bronchial washes, biopsies... you name it. This may sound extreme, but I was going through similar issues at the same time and both myself and my pulmonologist thought perhaps there was a common denominator, so I was really hoping to find an answer for both of us.   As the last two vets ran out of options, they both suggested that I take Zoe to an internist. I didn't even know there was such a thing! There are only a couple in the state, but everyone involved agreed that there was only one option, as Dr. Hoffman is considered to be one of the leading Veterinary Internists in the entire southwest. In fact, since having visited her practice, I have found out that people travel from all over the US to see her.   Taking your pet to Dr. Hoffman is unlike any other experience I have ever had. The service is literally on par with what you would receive if you were seeing a specialist yourself.   The office arranged for all my records to be available prior to Zoe's visit. The office then called me to set up the visit and provide a consultation. Based on Zoe's medical records, potential treatment options were reviewed and an overview of the process was provided.   Basic costs estimates were provided so I knew what I was in for and then the appointment was set. In order to minimize the stress on your pet, it is common to schedule time for the potential procedures along with your first consultation. So after my first phone call with the office, we had a game plan already defined.   Prior to my visit, Dr. Hoffman had thoroughly reviewed the file (I knew this because she had notes). She spent about one hour with me reviewing the records, performing an exam, and discussing treatment options. Once we had determined what she could use from previous treatments (biopsy results, etc.) I was given an estimate and Zoe went back in for her procedure.   There were regular communications from the office as to her progress throughout the day and when I went to pick her up; I was given a package of information that rivaled anything that I had received from my own physicians. I was sent home with the appropriate medications and was called on several subsequent days to check on her status. Follow up care, which is still ongoing (a couple of months later) was provided via phone consultations in order to minimize Zoe's stress and to avoid office charges for myself.   Overall, my experience at Vet Care was exemplary. It's not cheap, but if your pet has a serious issue, the multiple visits required elsewhere can quickly add up to more than your visits here and the level of service is unparalleled. Dr. Hoffman has elevated veterinary care and offers both professionalism and sensitivity. I really can't recommend her enough!

I've shared lunch with colleagues here and I have to say... not really impressed. The space is wonderful. Light, clean lines, uncramped, good flow - but I don't repeat visit a place that "looks" good. I simply don't have the time when there are so many places that bring me the whole package.   I don't know if there dinner menu is different, but there are a fair amount of selections without being overwhelming. There are only two meatless options, which I expect more of, especially in a Chinese restaurant. I've eaten ginger soy noodles and they are just bleh... if not a little greasy. Two of my friends seemed to enjoy their dishes and the fourth commented on hers being REALLY salty.   All of that could be forgiven if the flavor profile was strong enough to overcome the lack of creativity. But it just isn't.   For those of you looking for the "all inclusive" lunch special, keep driving. Here you will just get your entree item or app and a portion of white rice. They will bring you brown rice if you request and then remind them.   As it is a relatively small space, I would expect service to be attentive. And perhaps they have a different crew of people that work dinner, but we all sat with empty glasses grabbing employees as they walk by at arms length that seems oblivious to the fact that four people holding empty glasses is a sign that you might want to stop at the table.   Lastly, I sort of feel like GCB has a little bit of an identity crisis happening. It seems to want to the trendy go-to spot that pushes the tried and true Asian flavors to a new and updated level. Instead what it delivers is conventional, rather unremarkable food in really nice bowls.   Maybe we were just there on bad days. I get that. We all have them. But when you have other choices, I want some substance and wow.

Three stellar write-ups pushed me over the edge and I decided that it was time to take my self for a much needed pedi. When I arrived, the place was packed, but thankfully they gladly take walk-ins and I had only a brief wait before I was whisked away to my massaging, bubbling chair of goodness.  I have to echo the other reviewer's comments on cleanliness and down-right bargain for the service provided. Not once did I have that "eww, you aren't actually going to touch me with that" reaction. I didn't swoon from toxic vapors as soon as opening the door. And my attendant was super friendly and completely cool with the fact that I had clearly neglected my heals for the last two months (something that was hugely apparent after she started filing away - how mortifying... skin flying everywhere!!!)  And for those of you that might fear the Elaine experience (Seinfeld reference), fret not. You can actually understand everyone one that works here and shouldn't find yourself sitting and wondering "what in the hell are they saying about me now?"  Take your twenty-bucks (plus a little extra for tip - unless you get flowers you will need thirty) and go get some much deserved pampering.   Dear Paulene - my toes and heals thank you for the love! -- see pic ; )

This place has an amazing collection of things to buy the person that has absolutely everything. It is one of the nicest gift shops in the entire phoenix area (including Scottsdale) without the snobbery that I have come to expect from many boutique shops.  The staff is extremely friendly and their selection of wrapping materials is seriously out of this world. And on the odd chance that you can't find the perfict gift here, you can bring in your purchase from elsewhere and they will doll it up in the most amazing manner imaginable... the last time I gave someone a gift from here, it took the recipient three days to work up the courage to open it because the package itself looked like a peice of art!  Parking and entrance are on the back side, so turn down 8th and make an immediate left in to the lot. The store is at the end, next to Baker Bros. flooring.  Do yourself a favor the next time you need to find just that perfect gift and head on down to Do Me a Favor!  : )

West siders rejoice! The newest Ranch Market opened up last week and it's every bit as big and beautiful as the location down at 16th and Roosevelt!  Jason W and I tried to tour this new mecca on opening day, but were daunted by the 3500 other people doing the same. After making an illegal U-turn, we headed over to my little known Super Mercado instead and filled our need for some Melon Agua Fresca. That was one crazy scene.  Thinking the crowds may have settled a bit, my sister and I headed over today for some old fashioned South of the Border shopping. The crowd is still unbelievable, but oh so worth it.  Everything you have come to know and love about Ranch Market is now in my own backyard and I have a fridge of Carnitas, Tamales, Mexican Pastries and Cheese, and some simply beautiful produce to prove it!!  If you are in this part of town and you need to stock your shelves, this place has it. If you are driving down Indian School and are hungry for some of the best Sonoran Mexican food in the city, this place will make your head spin! If you are having a down day and want to samba your way down some aisles, one of amazingly friendly staffers will be more than happy to oblige!  Simply put... I am one satisfied gringo girl because grocery shopping just does not get better than this!!!

Phoenix Farms is a miniature version of the Phoenix Ranch Market down on Roosevelt. When you first walk in there is a booth that has various cerviches, fruit with a Chile dusting of your choice and the freshest licuados in town. It's like three little street vendors in one.  The bakery is immediately to your right and this was pure marketing genius! You can't believe the stuff in these cases! Their breads are to die for fresh. The gelatina cakes look like works of art. The cakes (both trés leche and regular) are almost too good looking to eat... almost. Seriously, it doesn't matter how big a rush I am in, the moment I see those cases, time stops and I have to inspect each and every item to see what has to go home with me!  The tortilleria runs seven days a week and they make EVERY kind imaginable. Fresh and soft. Crisp and brown. Whatever you need. This is where I head when I need anything flat and round!  The produce section is quite decent. Some times it requires a bit of rummaging, but they have everything that a standard section would have, plus everything you find at a fine shop south of the border.  The back wall is taken up by the "restaurant" section. They have tons of food to choose from and offer great "meal" deals where you can get things like 1 lb of carnitas with all the fix-ins to take home and mange to your hearts delight.  My BFF (aka: sisterwife) is from Spain and she was impressed with their meat and cheese selections. They regularly have such items as octopus, bacalao (salt cod), and parts of cows that aren't regularly seen in a butcher counter. She literally kept making these giddy little "ohh" noises. Seriously it took us like 15 minutes to walk the length of the counter!  Stop by on the weekend and you can pick up some of the fresh roasted meats or chiles that are being cooked up in the front of the store.  The store is always clean, the staff is friendly and is always willing to  help the gringo looking for a mexican squash, and did I mention the bakery?!!  If you aren't in the mood to run all the way down to 16th and Roosevelt, stop by Phoenix Farms. I think you will be pleasantly surprised!

As far as movie theaters go, this isn't too bad. As others have stated, the Movie Watcher Card is a must. I think it averages out to a free movie and small popcorn with every 15 and on the other visits, free red ropes every 5 visits, and $1.50 off popcorn or drink on the rest. This could be the because I have a bajillion points (resulting from a post divorce inability to sleep anywhere but movie theaters period).  Parking used to be an issue, but as the Arizona Center's popularity has declined over the years, not so much. The other plus for parking is that it is covered, which in the summer rates a huge WOOHOO. One suggestion on validating would be to remember to do it when you are entering the theater. The little machines that used to be located near the rear concession disappeared when they switched systems, so unless you want to hike back to the front, save yourself some steps.  Best feature: wait a couple of weeks after the movie opens and  you will be like the only one in the room; creating your own private screening. Never been huge on PDAs but it is nice to know that you could act like a teenager if you wanted to and it's super cool to see a movie without ten thousand screaming children on occasion.  Worst feature: the football field length hike to your screen. Maybe it's because I do wait a couple of weeks to avoid the crowds, but I always seem to be stuck back in either screen 23 or 24. This also makes popcorn or drink refills a little inconvenient... go in the middle of the flick and you could miss the center third of the movie.

Anyone that has their four-legged friends groomed at any frequency knows that time is of the essence. It is not uncommon to be on a leash (pun intended) for up to six hours, awaiting that phone call for return pick-up.  But Smelly Dog has broken that standard! They actually schedule each grooming individually and give you a spot on pick up time when you drop off. This not only makes mommie happy, but Isabel is in a far better mood when I go to pick her up. And I can't say that I really blame her. Would I be happy being locked in a kennel for the better part of the afternoon?!! No kennelling at Smelly Dog. Each client is treated with respect and love.  Remember to pick up your punch card and begin earning credits towards your free services (btw, they will also combine cards, if you have misplaced one).  Head on down to Smelly Dog with the poochies and you will be waggin' your tongues all the way home!!!

I have volunteered at this station since I was in high school (with a few years off here and there).  It is a great organization. Where else can you watch a Flogging Molly concert, learn how hummingbirds move their wings so fast, see somewhat unbiased news programs, catch some classic britcoms or police dramas, compare the value of your great grandmothers tea pot to one just like it, see a little bit of history about this state, find out the best way to make your own compost, catch the best in-depth exposés on TV, or see the latest escapades of the Lady Dowinger.... all in one week?!!  There are tons of things you can do if you want to become a friend of eight and volunteer.  If you come down, look me up, I'm probably poking around somewhere in the studio.  :)

There are those places that I review after one visit = mind blowing food and service which I am convinced is no fluke or so abysmal that the dogs of hell could not drag me back.   There are those places that I review after a handful of visits = consistent service and food or locations I would return to and not be embarrassed to admit.  Then there are those places that I have selfishly kept for my own, even after having eaten every item on their menu (multiple times) for fear that the next time I visit, I will have to fight for a table or parking spot. Bertha's Café falls in to this last group.  Bertha's is a small, yet comfortable space that has clean lines and simple décor. There is a large cart that always has a sampling of the most current gossip rags, architectural periodicals, and newspapers for your enjoyment. Soft tunes play in the background and simple prints of farmers' markets from around the world adorn the walls.  The food is the real focus and soul of this establishment. Breakfast is served daily until 11:00 a.m. and I would highly recommend the Waffles (served with honey butter and blueberry/maple syrup), the Roasted Tomato, Pesto Egg Sandwich (with arugula and havarti on an English muffin), or the Brioche Egg Sandwich (bacon, arugula, pesto, eggs, and parmesan). I also enjoy the Fruit Parfait which they make with seasonal organic fruit and home-made granola.  The only problem with lunch is that every time I go, I really want to have multiple items. My top three sandwiches are the Asparagus & Havarti Panini (oven roasted asparagus, pesto mayo, arugula, roasted red peppers and Havarti - grilled to perfection), Roast Beef and Blue Cheese (with mayo, tomato, arugula, and caramelized onions), and the Salami Pesto and Goat Cheese (with sundried tomatoes, pesto, and mixed greens). The wraps and soups are all wonderful, but I will be honest and say the sandwiches generally win out. And finally there are the salads... there are several, but some of my current favorites include: The chopped salad - chocked full of blue cheese, applewood smoked bacon, bell peppers, avocado, chicken and green onions. The Harvest Salad which is the perfect blend of candies walnuts, apples, blue cheese, and dried cranberries. Or the Curried Chicken Salad that is mixed with pinenuts, and dried cranberries.  Most of the salads can also be ordered in a wrap version. And thankfully, Bertha's offers "Lunch" specials which allow you to choose one of their daily soups and  1/2 of any salad, or  1/2 of any sandwich and either soup or  1/2 of any salad.  So other than unique menu offerings, what makes Bertha's so special??  The staff is unbelievably friendly and helpful. Servings are large. The sandwiches or salads can easily be shared or make two meals. All items that are listed in a vegetarian fashion can have chicken or ham added. A special kids menu provides options for those with less developed palates. In addition to their standard menu offerings, they have daily special sides and soups. Literally everything is freshly made (no pre-packaged garbage). And finally there is the desert counter. Bertha's offers a rather large selection of freshly made pastries, muffins, cupcakes, desert bars, and some of the most incredible cheese cake I've ever put in my mouth. Some items are seasonal, which somehow makes them even more desirable, as you know you will have to wait an entire 12 months to have such goodness again.  I have taken a number of people to Bertha's since first being introduced myself and have never heard anything but raves.  I really don't know how I will make it through the remodel... I'm quite sure I will go in to withdrawals!  Quite simply, the food is a spiritual combination of flavors and textures. And so it is with a fearful heart and the desire to support local businesses in this time of economic insecurity that I encourage you all to try Bertha's Café. Just remember, if you see me there and the place is full, I may force my way in to your table.  : )

Having just returned from another extraordinary lunch at Bertha's I realized that I neglected to mention one of my favorite things... the cupcakes! Anyone that knows me well, is aware of my long search for the perfect little cake. Well, let me just say, forget Sprinkles, forget Tammy Coe, and just head straight to Bertha's!   They have two sizes. Small tasters for $0.75 and full size beauties for $2.25. They generally have three regular rotating selections and an additional seasonal offering. Personal favorites are the Pumpkin (seasonal), the Carrot Cake, and the Chocolate. Red Velvet is almost always available, but I try to avoid anything with that much dye.   These little cakes are moist (can you believe it?!! a cupcake that actually has the texture of a full size cake, instead of compressed sawdust!), taste like the real thing and not just a fancified white cake dolled up on a Saturday night, and are topped with the perfect accompanying frosting pillow.   The minis are perfect for parties. They are just the right size to be considered "finger food" and will allow your guests to sample a variety of flavors. Call ahead if you have a specific request and they will generally accommodate your request.   If you are a fellow cupcake-o-file, make sure you stop in and give them a try. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!  ...now I have to go wipe the cream cheese frosting off my satisfied lips!!!

For grocery shopping in the CenPho area, it really doesn't get much better than this Safeway. Weird mood lighting aside (result of the great 2006 makeover) this store is nicely laid out and chocked full of everything you need stock your kitchen.  Yes the clerks seem to lurk in every aisle waiting to ask you if you are finding everything ok. But unlike my Chatty Kathy doll from childhood, they actually do wait for you to answer after you pull the string, so to speak. Once, one poor schloop even walked me clear back to the other side of the store in search of the dreaded velveeta that my mother asked me to pick up for her (seriously have you ever tried to clean this stuff up? it molds to anything it touches and I can only imagine what it does to our insides!) but I digress...  This store is so much better than the other options in the area it's almost laughable. If you go to the Fry's on Camelback on 23rd, it's a  production as putting on your Kevlar takes considerable time (the last time I went with my sister, there was a real shoot out in the parking lot, at which time she actually "hit the deck" right in to a puddle of some gross stickyness - fucking hilarious for me, not so much for her). And the Bashas on Osborn and 7th just creeps me out - don't know why but I always feel like I'm in some sort of Cryogenic waiting room.  The last plus for this store is that they have a super delivery program. You can order online and one of those overly friendly clerks actually shops for you! Sign up online and they will send you coupons every six weeks or so for free delivery service. With gas prices going through the roof, let them do the driving for you!  : )

Oddly enough this location offers free WiFi. So if you are in the hood, and desperate for some free waves, run in and grab a drink from the in-house Starbucks (or just grab it from the parking lot).

I've been eating at Mike & Rhonda's "The Place" for years. Having attended NAU I was introduced to Mike & Rhonda's almost 20 years ago (insert hacking sound referencing length of time).  They are consistently good. Portions are HUGE and easily make for a nice take home meal. The food isn't outstanding, but it's good and the service is remarkable considering that they are almost always full to the gills.  This is the perfect spot to take yourself after imbibing a little too much the night before or after church when you are being good.

This is hands down the best breakfast place in town. They do a super lunch and dinner as well, but I usually can't get off the breakfast selections. The "California Omelette" (Avocados, Mushrooms, and Jack Cheese) is superb, as is "The Volcano" which is made up of three fluffy / yummy pancakes, sausage, bacon, and eggs.   As other reviewers have noted, portions are ginormous. Go planning to share a selection or take at least another meal home with you. There can be a wait on the weekend, but once you get seated, service is prompt and attentive. (Albeit the Fuzzie Bear that walks around can get a little creepy around the fourth table pass).  BBD is supposed to be known for their desserts and they do look good, but the blackberry pie that I took home was more than a little tart and the crust was on the tough side. I wouldn't let this stop you from sampling as it could have been an isolated experience based on their reputation.  There are actually a few locations in the Phoenix area, so visit their website to see which one is closest to you.  http://blackbeardiner.com/location/  This definately isn't your parent's Denny's!

Whenever I feel the urge for a gravy fix, I head straight over to Mrs. White's. I almost always order the pork chops - smothered. OMG gravy goodness running all over the plate! As for the sides, just pick one - they are ALL good!   There isn't much that I can add to the other reviews, except that I have actually called Mrs. White's before holiday potlucks and had them whip up some extra cornbread for me to take. They always seem a little tickled at the request, but have never refused and it allows me to focus on the festivities (not to mention everyone expects it now).  If you are looking for really good food in a unique and relaxed setting Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe should not be missed.

I detest car maintenance.  Well that might be putting it mildly.  I would prefer if cars were just disposable and when their bits and bobs stopped working properly, we could just toss them in the recycle bin and move on. But since we don't live in a world where that exists I am so super excited that I foun Bogi, Doug, and the entire crew at 180 Degrees Automotive.  These people do everything right.  First of all they don't pressure you on anything. In fact, they go out of their way to tell you if something isn't worth the investment.  Seriously?!!  You're committed to saving me money?  I must have entered bizzaro land.  The shop is fusion of art gallery, wifi ready, keurig toting, comfiness so if you have to spend anytime there at all, you will not fell like you have to go home and shower afterwards.    The staff is super friendly and they all seem to know what is happening to your car and who exactly is with it at the blink of an eye.  I love this aspect.  I don't feel like some number on a parking tag hung around the mirror.  Before I picked my car up on the first visit, my service advisor knew more about my car's ticks and blurbs than I did.  And on subsequent visits, his memory of what was done and what things were listed as "something to think of down the road" were gone over.  It almost feels like taking your car to a really good physician.  Roll yourself down here and make sure you get one of their value program card things.  It has saved me a ton of money and makes paying for maintenance way less painful, especially when you consider how much you are not burning on monthly car payments.  This is honestly the first mechanic that I have fully trusted and have forced me to happily look at the practicality of keeping my car until the wheels acutally fall off. :)

My previous experience with D&B is all East Coast, so I had some pre-conceived expectations prior to this visit. Those establishments were the size of small countries that I've visited in Europe! This one... not so much. I would actually rate this location a solid 2.5 stars, but since I wasn't overwhelmed, I rounded down.   I took a single-mom friend and her kids here for a night out. We went on a Thursday night, so it wasn't overly packed, but there was a nice crowd. Having experienced D&B food before (not that there is really anything wrong with it, just meh and way overpriced), we ate at the nummy Cheeseburger Cheeseburger down the way. Definitely a good choice.  Upon arrival we navigated the maze of tables to the "card charging station" and loaded up our plastic. The kids ran amok like junkies in a poppy field for about 45 minutes - tickets filling their little buckets. Mom and I trailed behind, people watching. This was by far the most interesting activity of the night. There was the scary man at the boxing game that had seen one too many steroids. His neck was two feet wide and the GUI boxer opponent had no choice but to pummel that huge target. My friend and I actually considered giving this one a try until we saw his display. His grunts and thrusts had us looking for cover for fear that he would turn on us and our laughter would definitely give away our location. There was the skeletal like goth-anorexic girl that had doubled her size by applying thick layers of black makeup. And there were the high school jocks that all walked with that inexplicable bounce that teen boys have. Like I said, for us it was all about the people watching.  The highlight of the evening happened at the jump rope simulation. We all discovered that jumping over an electronic eye posed far more of a challenge than anyone could imagine. Seriously this thing was way too funny (not so much for the jumper, but rather those watching the jumper contort and pounce).  Seventy-five minutes after entering, we were all out of money and selecting our "prizes" from the D&B store of crap. All in all we had a decent time. So why you may ask would I give this a 2 star rating? Well this little 75 minute trip into game land cost me $175 dollars and all I got to show for it was a bruise from when I was hiding from the roided dude on the boxing game. Yes there were 5 of us, but if I'm going to throw down this kind of money on games, I'm definitely going to Game Works!

Harry would have never survived a meal at this place with Sally!  My friend and I stopped in here after a movie and I have to say this is one chain that I would whole heartedly recommend to anyone, with the possible exception of people with ADD. I'm not sure they could deal with all the choices on the menu!  We were quickly seated and our server gave us a quick menu 101 lesson (starters here... sauces here... burgers and salads over here... one gazillion toppings and combinations over here, etc). I could have taken 20 minutes vacillating over my selections, but my friend was growing impatient, so I plunged in for their small burger with blue cheese, grilled onions, mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, and a side of barbecue. Generally I like my burgers medium-rare, but medium is as low as you can go and in reality, their medium is more on the MR side so I was happy.  We split the Frings and for my shake I chose to combine the Chocolate Chocolate with White Chocolate Raspberry.  There was a bit of a wait for the meal, but our server was very attentive and let us know as progress was being made. Considering that there were no free tables either inside or out, the wait wasn't really that bad.  When the food arrived I was in burger heaven. Yes, yes, yes this place would likely win the award for most non-healthy option, but when the juices started working their way down my arm and then one perfect drop plopped on to my right breast (ever so slightly exposed in one of those trendy little numbers) my first thought was literally to try and lick it off. Quickly assessing the age of the children at the next table, I decided that probably wasn't the most appropriate response. Sadly I daubed the little drop away... And thankfully, each table has their own role of paper towels, so there was no need to bother our server with a pesky request for additional nappies!  The shakes were heavenly, the fries were twice fried (as all good fries should be), and the onion rings were some of the best I've ever had.  They have a great web order system that I checked out as soon as I got home, but parking is so unbelievably unavailable at the Tempe Marketplace that I'm not sure this "run in and grab it" approach will really be of much use at this location.  You can definately get in and out for under $10/person, but if you are going for sides and a shake, it will run you $13 and up, depending on the size of burger and drink. Considering the other options for burgers at TMP, I would strongly recommend piecing together a paper towel suit of armor and diving in to Cheeseburger Cheeseburger!

Lovin' the new pub!  I've been there three times in the last couple of weeks and have to admit that I'm hooked. Where else can you get Strongbow on tap, and The Pogues, Dropkick Murphy, The Tossers, and Flogging Molly on the box?!! The food isn't half bad either!  They have a phenomenol HH with apps at half off and drink specials that actually make it reasonable. My first trip came in at $25 for three apps and 4 pints. We sampled the wings, some weird little sausage rolls, and the corned beef and cabbage taquitos (which I must say were quite tasty in a really unexpected way). The best part was that Donelle (ask for her if you are there), lined me up with the second pints 2 minutes before the prices went up to save me a little moola!  They have live music three or four nights a week, pub trivia when there is no band and sunday afternoons they do Seisiun (think fraggle rock with Irish or celtic instruments). Check out their website for details shows http://www.timfinnegans.com/index.htm  This place is comfortable, way not pretentious, and may just be my new home away from home!  Slainte  : )

I have been seeing Koltton for about five years. I absolutely adore this man!! When you walk in to his salon, it literally is like entering another world. His professional demeanor and care to detail, as mentioned by others is absolutely impeccable.  I have never left his presence not feeling better about myself and the way I look. How a waxing or masque treatment can make that much difference is amazing. And it's not just the obvious, I look better now, that I am talking about. My mind has been cleared. The fact that I no longer feel like Sasquatch is just a benefit.  If you have any needs whatsoever, his services are vast. Please call Koltton if you have any personal needs that you don't dare attempt when a true professional is available.

Mmmmmm Mamma Mia! So much has already been said already, but I still feel compelled to throw in my two cents worth...   My ideal Friday night? A medium mushroom pie, extra crispy (which is still fold-able btw) with one of their huge antipasto salad. Regarding the salad, think less traditional antipasto and more like the ideal chef salad, with the perfect balance of meats, cheeses, sun dried tomatoes and pepperocinis. Oh just writing about this salad makes my mouth water! And when I say huge, it's really enough to make 3 to 4 decent sides or two ginorous meals!   The staff is extraordinarily nice. One evening I called in an order rather late and they were tidying up in the back. They asked if I was there for a pick up and when I said I was, they had me come in through the back rather than walk around to the front by myself in the dark. It's those kind of touches that make this place feel very warm and homey. And the last time I was in, I finally inquired about their delivery area and was pleasantly surprised that I am just inside the borders - yeah me!!!   Others have pretty much covered the range of the wonders contained in this small space, so let me just add that they are one of the participants in the restaurant.com program, so you can actually score some really cheap food here if you have a little pre-planning action going on.   Although this location focuses on a pared down menu, all of the must haves are represented so if you haven't already given Mamma Mia's a try, you really must.

I joined the crew last night for the HH organized by the fabulous Christina P. Although it was my first visit and I generally like to sample a place a few times before reviewing, there were so many of us there that I felt that I had gotten a pretty well-rounded experience and had enough information to provide input.   Phoenix is known for its host of strip mall restaurants, but few can actually transport you to another place. The restaurant interior is a mix of kitschy Italian and moderately nice mainstream. The main patio is actually about the same size as the restaurant interior and is flanked by two cute NYC street scenes (think universal studios city scene) with each window telling a different story and the Statue of Liberty holding court. Very quaint! The back of the patio is taken up by a complete bar. The fire pit that others have mentioned is situated in the middle. The patio is clearly the place to be at this venue!  Service was spot on, which was unexpected for such a large group. I have to echo Georgie S., the bartender seemed to single handedly (with the exception of bussing support) kept our brood quenched and fed with no errors. He asked each guests name upon their initial order and remembered them throughout the remainder of the evening. No simple feet, if you consider that we had at least 20 people in our party and he was also serving the numerous other guests that shared our al fresco setting.  The manager Matt, came out to thank us for coming by and informed us that there is a separate patio in the back to accommodate private parties/functions. What a divine setting for almost any family or business gathering!  In addition to the ambience and service, there is the food... Oddly one of the best things of the evening was the free appetizer provided to each table, which consists of bread and a parmesan/pesto dipping sauce that is so infused with garlic that its sweet fragrance swirls in the air. Now as Bacon B. points out, this will stay with you (i.e.: if you are on a date, you should both eat some) but it is seriously out of this world! I also really enjoyed the bruschetta, which is a classic take on the dish in every aspect except size. More often than not you will receive four or six small slices of toast with some tomatoes and basil carefully assembled on top, but not here... instead you will be served a small flatbread mounded with fresh hand cut tomatoes, chiffonades of basil and more of that dreamy garlic.  I was also able to sample two of the new pizza offerings. The Roberto's (ironically offered up by the fabulous Robert M.), which was set off by a sprinkling of pepperocinis offering just a little kick, and the White pizza which had more of those rich garlic undertones. Although I enjoyed the toppings on each of the pizzas, I was left wanting more from the crust. Both were uniform in size and shape and a little on the tough / dense side, which made me wonder if they were not made in house. That said, it was not enough to detract from the overall experience and I will definitely be back in the near future.

Went tonight with my sister and BIL. I swore to them it would be a quick in and out and hours later we all made our way back to the car with our treasures in hand and humming the theme to Peter Gunn (a favorite from one of several bands which were performing).   The thing that really sets this apart for me is the sense of community which is woven around its every component. It's not your typical art/craft thing where you feel like people are just there to sell their wares. It feels natural or somehow organic and the public clearly responds. I loved the number of family units I saw spending/sharing their evening together and it was super pet friendly.  Add in a sprinkling of Yelpers here and there (Audrey W. and Deb L. are great huggers!) and it was truly a wonderful time. I went as a sign of support and came home a fan. Can't wait to do it again!

The BEST Italian food outside of NYC or Italy itself! This place is so unexpected it's amazing. It's a tiny little restaurant at the end of a strip mall located just East of I-17 (look for it on the North side of the road next to a hair salon and Circle K). You cannot let the location fool you... this place is great. I heard it rumored that the owner was an executive chef at some foo-foo place in Scottsdale that had creative differences with the management, so he left to open his own place. I didn't have the courage to ask him, but he is straight out of Napoli and the food is fresh and exciting.  I took two friends and we literally were fighting over who had the better food. It was so good that we had each picked out at least four more entrees that we wanted to come back for and were scheduling out visits to accommodate a goal to try every single item! I mean seriously there was no table talk or chit chat... all we talked about was the food.  Pizza A Metro only has a handful of tables, but when you walk in the door they start baking the most amazing Italian Flat Bread in their wood brick oven. It's served with a cold side of sauteed onions, eggplant, black olives and capers. The topping is good enough to eat straight out of the bowl and the bread is tender and hot. We ended our meal with a serving of homemade Tiramisu that was so orgasmically good, you could literally spread it over your naked body, lick it off and call it a night!  In addition to an extensive menu, they have two specials that change daily. Entrees are moderately priced between 7.95 and 8.95, the pastas are homemade and many can be interchanged with the various sauces or toppings of your liking. In addition to the pasta and meat selections they have an assortment of soups/salads/starters and several pizzas/calzones. Portions are large and filling (for example the "Metro" sized pizza is literally 39 inches across - seriously the guy showed me!).  For all you CenPho folks, they deliver from 35th Ave to Central and Camelback to Buckeye. They are open Monday - Thursday from 11:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Friday - Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.  The only downside that I could find (other than the limited table space) was that they don't serve liquor. But they do encourage b.y.o. and will cork it for you table-side.  This is the kind of place that Yelp was designed for. A local hole in the wall that serves mind blowing food and no one knows about. Please please please visit this place because it's only six blocks from my house and now that I know they are there I can't imagine them going out of business.  : )  06/05/2008 Update: Okay I officially have a problem because I have now eaten at this place 5 times in the last two weeks, have sampled about 60% of their menu and am convinced that when introducing myself it should go something like this: "Hi my name is Julie and I am a Pizza A Metro addict." Are there any 12 step groups for a restaurant junkie???

My BFF and I played hookie today to lunch it up. As always the food is out of this world good. In fact, during desert, she actually schooshed me, because she was having a moment with the tiramisu. Normally I wouldn't add this sort of thing to a review, but seriously... she schooshed me!   PAM will now be open from noon to 8:30 on Sundays. They are staffing up for the opening of their Scottsdale location and the place is all a buzz. Although you can generally get in with little or no wait during lunch, you would be smart to call ahead or make a reservation for dinner. Also their liquor license is in process, but you can still BYO.

We stopped in here tonight to grab some kona coffee ice cream draped in hot fudge and there were a few issues, so I'm deducting one star.   1) They had a small acoustic group performing that was 70's wonderful but they were so loud we literally had to scream our orders to the staffer.  2) The staffer was either new, or short bus special, because we had to tell him that the whole point of ordering a sundae was to get the toppings (he didn't offer and I wasn't paying $5.25 for two scoops of ice cream).  3) The previously larger than life scoops have experienced significant shrinkage. They really aren't even normal size scoops anymore.  4) Some how my $5.25 sundae came out to $6.27 after tax. I know AZ is experiencing a budget crisis, but there is no way that taxes have gone up that much, so I must conclude that I was overcharged.  5) The place was so full of Zpizza customers listening to the music that there was literally nowhere to sit, unless we went to the noticeably empty pizza side. The result was not only a complete invasion of my personal space (I simply don't like rubbing up against strangers just to get to the counter unless I'm at a bar) but it also created a really strange odor comprised of pepperoni and sugar... far from appetizing.   All in all, the visit was a complete disappointment - but the band was great.

Met the girls here for lunch this last weekend. It was.... meh... well just chainy. The chips were really crisp, but sort of bland and tasted like they came out of a box that had been sitting on a dusty Food City shelf since 1999. The salsa was okay, but sort of blah and tasted like it was straight out of a jar. The rice was a little too on the al dente side and tasted like it came out of an air zip bag vacuum packed for the Russian space station. And the the beans, well they were barely beanish and tasted like they came out of those old white generic cans with the bar codes that were the only differentiation between products. All in all the food was rather disappointing, even by chain standards. I mean for God's sake, we're in AZ people! I get that you are part of a chain, but have some pride and at least put out a product that resembles it's Mexican origins.  I will say that the wait staff was relatively attentive. Not easy when you consider that we were an intimidating sort of group... and got more so with each drink.  The highlight of the meal was when I looked up and eyed a HUGE chandelier thing made out of empty miscellaneous beer bottles. Sort of sad when the lighting is the highlight of your meal...  If you are looking for decent Mexican food, mueva su coche pequeo someplace else mi amigo!

MEOW! This place is great - super clean, loaded with an amazing assortment of natural foods for both pooches and kitties, and two fridges jammed full with raw diet selections!  My four-footed kids were in heaven going through the bags!  Not wanting to offend anyone in my bunch (it's impossible to travel anywhere with three dogs and two cats, while simultaneously maintaining any level of decorum), I went solo this weekend to support the latest AzRESCUE effort being sponsored by the store. In addition to them sending me home with a complimentary Yoghund for each of the kids, I got some great insight to private training that my youngest is in desperate need of if he ever hopes to be socially acceptable, and some great toys for the felines. The staff was unbelievably nice, they have some truly unique items, and the prices range from "wow that's pretty cheap" to OMG do I dare?!!!  This is a great option to the chains and big box stores, so grab your leash, wag that tail, and pad your way on down to the Noble Beast!!!

I'm officially in my happy place! Yummy homemade Cuban food one mile from my house!!!  My BFF, a co-worker, and I headed over here for lunch. As the name would indicate, it's a buffet, but you can order anything off the buffet as a main dish and a few other standard items are available daily (Cuban sandwiches - didn't try these today, but they looked just like the ones that I sucked down in Miami, Plantainos Maduros - yummy caramelized plantains, Tostones - smashed plantains fried in to little fritters, and OMG good Flan).  We got there a little before noon and the place was full. The crowd was a mix of families and suit types. We were greeted by the friendliest of staff and headed off to the one free table. The menu and prices for the buffet vary by day and they are closed on Mondays. Take out is sold by the pound, so eating in is definitely the best bargain. As this was our first visit, we each decided to have the buffet to ensure we got to sample as much as possible.  The main buffet has around 14 items. We tried the following: *Pollo Frita (Fried Chicken) and Fricasé de Pollo (Sauce Chicken) - both were juicy and tender. *Estofado de Res Al La Jaudinera (Pulled Pork with Vegetables in a Tomato Sauce) *Puerco Asado (Unbelievably good roasted Pork - tender and juicy with just the right amount of fat for flavor) *Yuca Root (served in large slices - tender and yummo) *Con Gris (Black Beans and Rice) *Frijol Colorado (Red Beans)  In addition they had two additional rices, menudo, pan (little rolls - these were the only things that were somewhat generic), and a soup (but we all thought it was way too hot out to try this one).  There are two smaller buffets - one with fresh fruits and a tossed salad, and one with deserts (which we didn't even get to because we were so full).  We added the Tostones (4 smashed plantains - fried in to little pancake like fritters) and Plantainos Maduros (caramelized plantains that we dusted with sugar - sending them right over the edge of gastric heaven). I think these were each $1.50 extra.  Ended the meal with cubano coffee (mine con leché) and flan (really some of the best that I have had - dense and creamy with just the perfect amount of caramel sauce). I think the coffees were $1.50 each and the flans were $3.00 (well worth the investment and the perfect ending to a wonderful meal).  Lunch ran about $16.00 for each of us, but we could have gotten out for under ten each if we had just stuck to the buffet. They have a decent selection of Cuban / Latin drinks, and coke products. And I'm pretty sure I saw someone with a Corona, so they must serve beer as well.  This place used to be a Pizza Hut and doesn't appear to have gone through much updating, so don't expect much in the form of atmosphere, but the food is really good - not fancy (more like you would get at someone's home), and is very clean. The wait staff is extraordinarily nice and as they knew we hadn't been there before, kept asking if everything was ok and if we had any questions.  One and a half hours after entering the place, we rolled ourselves back out in to the heat and vowed to be back soon! We were all so full that we would have been more comfortable if they had a wheel barrow service that could have ported us to the cars, but c'est la vie...  So if anyone out there is looking for a good alternative to Havana Café, please check this place out. The food isn't fancy schmancy, but it is all very good and authentic (Mama does the cooking!) and the Latin music in the background will have your toes tapping throughout your meal.

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.... oh wait wrong story! But it does seem like a long time ago that I first read that they were closing my beloved Chez Nous to put up yet another transplant grocery chain. I was bitter to say the least! But as all of the best stories have happy endings, Chez Nous found a new home and F&E happened to be the new guy on the block.  I love having an F&E so close to home. They are not perfect, but they are pretty darn close for someone who is single and loves to cook. Yes, you have to watch the dates, but that's mostly because they don't have 54 days worth of back stock - just enough to keep the shelves covered, therefore they are constantly restocking with new items (thus the lovely discount sticker seek and find game that I like to play).  And no, I'm not a huge fan of the plastic packaging that fills my recycle bin, but for the convenience of checking out (as noted by arik b.) it makes things --  well... easy.  A couple of things I really like about this store: 1) The pre-made products - which I don't really use as intended (e.g.: the Wild Mushroom soup isn't exactly my thing, but as a base for gravy, it makes an incredible pot roast!) 2) The $5 coupons I get every week. I can easily spend the required $20 on fruits and veggies every week, so why not go for the discount!! 3) The "special" shelves up by the door that feature really nice organic herbs that I can add to my garden or flowers to give my table a little color. And watch these, because they discount them to some killer prices!!!  The store is always clean and bright, there are generally enough staffers around to provide assistance when needed, and they have pretty decent hours.  What more could you want from your neighborhood grocer?!!

Whenever I am running around in the Deer Valley area, I try to stop in to this location. They seem to be a little less crowded (for the most part) than their other locations and I've never had an issue with slow table bus-sing, etc.  The most appealing part of this chain is that their food is consistent and reasonably priced.   Personal favorites for breakfast are either of the Fritatta's (Honey-Cured Ham and Brie or Feta and Roasted Vegetable) if I'm feeling the need for something substantial. If I'm feeling a little sinful, I go straight for the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, sans syrup and slathered in fresh whipped butter and blueberry compote (ask nicely and they'll pony up extra blueberries). Blue teeth be damned, I simply can't get enough of these things - they are light and melt in your mouth with the most amazing flavor. I used to always buy a package of the mix on the way out, so that I could indulge in privacy, but I've only seen the basic mix as of late. : (  For lunch or dinner I'm a sucker for the Roast Beef and Gorgonzola Sandwich (perfectly rare Roast Beast topped with fresh greens, roasted red peppers, and just the right amount of cheese) or the Wildflower Two, which allows you to select any two from their daily soups, half sandwich, or salads.  If you don't have time for a meal, stop in and grab a loaf of yummy bread. My personal favorites are the Nine Grain and the Honey Wheat-berry. Or have some real fun and buy one of their mother truck-in HUGE soft pretzels. These things are so big, you could hook each side loop on to your ears and wear them as a mask... hey maybe I'm seeing a new super hero being born... pretzel man!  Any way you slice it, you should be able to find something to tempt your palette, so grab your table card, fill up your drink, enjoy whatever local artist they have performing, and delight in the world of carbs!

Pizza A Metro in CenPho is branching out! For those of you on the East side, you will pleased to know that they are ramping up their new location in the next few weeks with some invite only soft-launches. If you want to be included, stop by the Thomas location and give them your contact info...  The hard launch is scheduled for October 1, 2008.  I sat down with Maurizio today during lunch and got some of the particulars to whet your appetites --   The new location is larger, much larger. They will have a wine room, a bar that will seat approximately 25, and the dining room with seating for 80+.  Some of your favorites will appear on their menu, but Amarone will include a lot of new items which are more in line with the larger kitchen and the more upscale flavor of the new site.  Amarone will be open from 11:00 to Midnight.  For anyone that hasn't had the pleasure of meeting or dining with Maurizio, you are in for a treat. This man LOVES food and experiences obvious pleasure from sharing it with others!  East-siders, mark your calenders and get ready for Amarone!

My sister and I finally got to get some quality time here when we were on our recent "where won't the carnivore go eat out week".  We went early on a Tuesday and were glad we did because before we left it was full to the brim.  Although the space is wide open, sound is kept to a minimum so even when they are overflowing you can still have a conversation.  The food is has been covered but let me add in my vote for the inside out burger, which is a flavor explosion of tangy, tart, spicy, and sweet in one crunchy bite.  Because the "bun" is actually the quinoa patties, it is a fork and knife event and pure bliss.  Dinner ended with a shared portion of the squash pie which comes with a side of the cocunut whipped cream and let's just say they should just sell big bowls of that cream.  It is light and airy just like the fatty traditional whipped cream but it has a delicacy that is not in it's heavy counterpart and the subtle infusion of the cococnut... well let's just say I could eat my way out of a bathtub full of the stuff.  I completely agree with Matthew K on his callout on the liquor. It seems very odd to me that you can shot up your smoothies considering their "healthy style" but who am I to argue with the anti-inflamatory king, Dr. W?  But that said, the wait staff was so extraordinarily friendly and attentive in a non-creepy (i.e., please go away) sort of way that I quickly lost traction on that rant.  Luckily after giving the menu a full once over, we decided the carnivore would be satisfied with the choices, so we will definately be back for some more of the kale salad goodness. :)

So let me just say upfront that this place redefines kitch! I mean I would be shocked if you could find one square inch on a counter or wall that is not filled with some cutesy cup or sloppy slang. But I adore this place. It's small and there is almost always a bit of a wait, but the staff hustles and they are incredibly friendly.   The menu is surprisingly large and creative for a family run, diner style breakfast and lunch place. They offer the obvious choices you would expect of this fare, but then they toss in a little something to juice it up. They have a standing Steak and Eggs special for $5.95 that I have never sampled but I've seen one hell of a lot of them move through that kitchen! They also have a fairly decent all you can eat Fish deal from 11:00 to close. My personal favorites would have to be either... wait for it... "The Julie Plate" (yes it is actually called that) or the Breakfast Burrito (which bulges with ham, sausage, bacon, cheese, chiles, and country potatoes). But try one of their daily specials, like German Pancakes, and you may be hard pressed to go back to the regular menu. One word of caution is that the servings here are HUGE. I can literally make three meals out of the BB and still have a bite or two to share with my dogs.   Ronnie's opens at 6:00 or 6:30 a.m. (don't know which, because I'm not awake at that time of day) and closes at 2:00 p.m. It is not pretentious. It is the kind of place that is comfortable, clean, and serves a steady stream of loyal customers which are greeted by name along with hugs and smiles. Prices are reasonable if you consider the amount of food you receive, and the consistent quality / selection far exceeds that of the most popular chains. If you are looking for trend, go somewhere else... it will just make my table free up a little sooner. ; )

So how does one go about trying to capture the essence of their love/hate relationship with a Wal-Mart? Falling prices and the happy yellow smiling face aside, do you embrace the mascot for consumerism or come down on the side of price fixing and driving the supply market to third world countries? I will admit, there are times moral ethics take a back seat to getting a good deal and I will head on out to my local store. On those occasions, I can be guaranteed of a few things: 1) You will not ever find a parking spot anywhere near one of the entrances, so don't even bother with lot trolling. 2) Locating someone to answer a question is like searching for the Holy Grail. 3) At some point during your visit, you will have to step over a soiled diaper. 4) You will find a meat or dairy product tucked away in the hunting gear or automotive department. 5) You will become convinced that some parents have chosen the store as their babysitter and dropped their kids off at the door, leaving them to run screaming through the aisles, spreading terror wherever they go. 6) Your cart will either pull to one side, making it impossible to maintain a straight line OR will make a piercing shrill noise similar to that of a howler monkey. 7) They will be out of the one thing that made your visit imperative. 8) The clothing department will look like they were filming a scene for the movie Twister. 9) The customer service line will be snaked longer than an E-Ticket ride at Disneyland during spring break. (I believe this is a plot to lesson your likelihood to return items) 10) They will only have 3 checkout lanes open and the person in front of you will have selected the single item with no pricing information, requiring a price check (see #2) OR will not have enough money to pay for everything and will have to pare down their purchase.  For those of you that are looking for BIG excitement, take a tour of this place at 11:00 p.m. on Christmas Eve. I promise you an experience you will never forget!

Scramble has become a new favorite spot for breakfast... and clearly from the number of people that are packed in on any given visit, I am not alone.   This is one of those places that I had to ignore my first impressions. My initial thought was 'oh dear, another trendy spot that never lives up to the hype". And with it's wall menu and counter ordering, it is a trendy. But there are several points that clearly raise the comfort level.   Between the wall of windows and bright lighting there is an airy feel to the place. The drink bar in the center of the room is a five-star bonus IMO. Yes, I have been accused of being a control freak in the past (and they say it like it's a bad thing...) but I love being able to create the perfect cup of coffee, suited for my tastes and mine alone. The tables, while very close together are always serviced immediately to accommodate the constant inflow of patrons. And even though the place always seems to be brimming to the rim, I have never felt rushed through either my meal or my paper. I also love the various selections on the flat screens that encircle the room. There is literally something for everyone (and how many people can actually say that they shared their yogurt parfait with Ed Begley Jr. on GTV?!!).   Now for the food. I've been enough times to have sampled quite a few offerings and have even begun to create a list of favorites. On the top of that favorite list is the Gringo-Cherrywood bacon, egg & cheddar cheese Breakfast Burrito. This thing is large enough for two, or a second meal and is literally stuffed full of the perfect balance of egg, meat, and cheese! Ask for extra salsa, because one cup is not nearly enough for this big boy!!! The Brizzas (breakfast pizzas) and French Toast (baguette slices dipped in vanilla custard) are also tops on my list. As far as sides go, the Scramble Hash Browns are a must have! They seem to take a little longer to make and are really more of a hash brown/bacon/cheese tart-lette which are browned to perfection. I have literally had to defend mine from incoming utensils and believe that a quick thrust of the fork to the back of the offenders hand is quite an effective technique...   My only real criticism of the place is that if you have placed separate orders, your food may not be served at the same time. But this is so minor in comparison to the quality and the fact that clearly everything is made to order (not pre-done and waiting to be placed on a plate), that I can't really hold this against them. Then again, it may simply be that I have an addiction to those hash brown cakes! ; )   On-line ordering is coming to their website and that will add an additional level of love for this place.   This is a welcome addition to the breakfast scene and if you are in need of some flavorful morning num-nums, Scramble on over!

My review is actually on the meal service that Luci's provided for Thanksgiving.  The family had some issues to deal with over the holidays and the thought of creating a big meal was overwhelming so I shopped around and after much debate settled on Luci's for the meal.  I really can't describe how happy I was with my choice.  The food was AMAZING.  I've had pre-bought meals like this before, but this actually all tasted like something that came out of a kitchen with a cook that cared about what they were serving to their own guests.  Seasonings were pronounced, yet mild and the fresh herbs could be seen throughout.  There were options to select from and rather than getting piddly little portions, you received enough to actually feed a family.  The highlights of the meal were the mashed potatoes (seriously how they made these is still beyond me because they were SO light and fluffly), the green bean caserole that was better than anything coming out of that campbell's can, the seasonal salad that could be substituted for any side, and the turkey itself.  Every single person at the table raved about each component of the meal and the fact that it was made with locally sourced ingredients just makes it all the better.  To top everything off, they loaded everything into the car and the packaging was perfect for both transport as well as storage (because there were a ton of leftovers).  I will absolutely do this again and would recommend them to anyone looking to simplify while still holding on to traditions.  Call ahead because I was told that I literally got the last meal as they had not counted on them being so popular but don't call too far ahead becuase I might have to fight you for your turkey. :)

This was one of those places that I wanted to like, just for the mere fact that they are sort of a cornerstone of the downtown Glendale scene. I wanted to like this place so much that I didn't write this review based on one visit, nor two, but three strikes you're out!  There isn't much that Bitzee Mama's does well. In fact the only redeeming trait might be the salsa (but even that isn't enough to bring me back of my own fruition). The service is "OMG - I CAN FEEL MY HAIR GROWING" slow. The food is nothing memorable - if you even get what you order (once I ordered a cheesesteak and I just got the cheese - I kid you not, no meat). The prices are actually high for what you get - and check your bill because once I was charged $47.38 for a soda and sammie which I actually had to argue about with the manager (I was pretty sure I could take her, but dang that's just not right).  Mama's may have been a staple in the past, but her age is showing and she desperately needs a calgon moment!

I am in grad school and needed a local place for resources on LGBT concerns. I live in the area so I headed over with a few classmates after calling and getting some basic information.  I explained what I was looking for and the extraordinarily nice person on the phone went through the myriad of services offered at the center in addition to explaining all the resources available.  After advising me that they have the largest LGBT concentration library in the U.S., I knew that my classmates and I would be hard pressed to find better place to begin our research.  The center is very comfortable. When we arrived, we checked with the greeter and were directed towards the back, where we would find the library.  There is also a wall of information (literally) that has more resources and information on it than you could possibly imagine. There is not one square inch of space that is not fully utilized.  For anyone that wants to start out slowly, the website has a fantastic calendar of events which outlines all the support groups for both people in the community as well as supporters or just anyone that wants more information. Some events have a small fee, many are free, and some accept an offering to off-set costs.  As a future therapist, I am excited to know that this place is here and is so welcoming.

So the five stars on this one is more about the location than anything else.  I love PJ.  I never tire of their menu as there are many options that I find tastey and sensible if you automatically box half of it to go (i.e., portions are HUGE).  What I am typically not a fan of when it comes to PJ is that they all seem cramped, making use of every square inch of floor space.  But this one...  ah. This location is airy and open; dare I say - spacious?!!  Parking can be a little snark inspiring but once you get past that and get into the actual restaurant, take a deep breath and enjoy of the wonderfullness of PJ without having to rub elbows with the people at the tables on either side of you.  ;)

La Condesa Gourmet Taco Shop   After a long break from Yelp, I knew that eventually I would find myself in a situation where I could no longer hold my tongue, and my need to share would overpower my desire to remain silent. La Condesa GTS created just that situation.   I entered this space wound tighter than a spring ready to pop. Surely there could be no way that it could meet the lofty expectations set forth by my fellow yelper's reviews. But there is something very pure about this place, and as I stepped through the over-sized wood door, I knew this southwest girl was home.   The best way I can describe the atmosphere is Southwestern Minimalist. Monique H was dead on with her praises for the artwork - The Blue Demon (long live Alejandro Muñoz Moreno) proudly intermingles with Diego and Frida and the acid treated floors feel natural. I also liked that this is clearly a community effort, with the art work provided by two exceptional Mexican artists (Manuel Gilavalos y Garcia and Ricardo Ramirez) and the furniture/décor provided by Bellas Artes de Mexico. I love that there is already a partnership, holding this little gem up until it can take flight.   The food is clean. The flavors crisp. The portions more than adequate, and the prices less than I would expect to pay for such quality. Most selections can come in the form of a taco, a quesadilla, or a burro, although there are one or two additional options under both the quesadilla and burro menus. Each flavor combination is clearly described and in a handful of situations, there are salsa suggestions outlined on the out of this world salsa bar. The best way I can describe this is to think of a wine pairing with a food that will make flavors pop... in other words, just try it because the sum of the parts is way better than the individual components!   The Mayan Conchita Pibil and the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken are two of the finest examples I've had of either. Both are mouth wateringly moist and fairly melt. I would suggest the Peanut or Mexican salsa as additional choices for the MCP for the spicy recommended habanera. The guacamole and cilantro salsas were both mild choices and if the mole were not already a mouthful of perfection, might be the additional layer of flavors that bring you to the tipping point. Personally, I found the pickled onions severed atop with some of the Jicama salsa, tossed in for a little crunch, just enough to make my eyes roll back in to my head. I mean seriously, if I could wiggle around naked in this stuff, it would be a really good night! The Aztec Tinga is deceptively simple. Your first bite may seem relatively ordinary, but then start the countdown. Within a few seconds, the flavors hit you like a wall of emotion. Your lips and tongue begin to tingle with the heat of the perfectly balanced peppers. My BIL has tried the Sonoran Carne Asada and was unusually quiet as he made his way through his plate, so I have to assume that was good as well. Finish things up with those out of the world beans, or some of the grilled Mexican Calabacitas and a meal just can't get much better.   So much has already been said about the iconic salsa bar, there really isn't much I can add, except to say, try them all! You will find two or three that send you to your happy place.   The staff was super friendly and more than ready to answer questions or make suggestions. It's an order at the counter and take-a-number kind of place, but you can generally expect several service passes through the dining room.   My only cautions / suggestions would be to grab a takeout menu so you don't have to stand and look at the wall menu with your mouth gaping like a cod fish and be prepared to park along Palm if the street inset parking area is full.   This is my new love. I will definitely be adding this in to the regular rotation. At a dinner plate with drink running you between 8 and 9 dollars (with enough food to make two decent sized meals) this is one indulgence I can fit in to my life with little or no rationalizing. Please take the time to check this place out and support yet another wonderful family owned business. Look around when you come in, because I may be joining Joel L on one of his weekly visits. : )

When I was diagnosed with several lung tumors in February of 2010, I had no idea what I was in for. Xrays, Ultrasounds, MRIs, CT Scans, Pet Scans... tubes and machines that were scarry, loud, and intimidating.  I have been inside at least six different Imaging centers up to twice a month since then and have experienced the gamut of service levels.  The staff and convenience of Marquis is almost unparalleled. They take walk ins, coordinate everything with my Dr.'s and surgeons so I don't have to worry about details and can concentrate on myself, offer some of the newest and most powerful scans, hand me a CD of the results to take home with me, and have an extraordinarily friendly / compassionate staff.  It's the staff that makes this my first choice - every time. I have found over the last year that it is not uncommon to find health care providers that seem wearied over dealing with a constant flow of health challenged people and the system itself. But the people here make you feel like you are the only person they are dealing with. They look you in the eye. They hold your hand. They talk to you in a language that the medically untrained understand. They don't treat you like you are a peice of meat.  Most imaging is not painful. But it is not pleasant. So when you have someone like Tara, who's warm and caring demeanour makes it seem not quite so awful, it really stands out.  If you find yourself in need of diagnostic imaging, don't hesitate to give Marquis a call (and hope you are lucky enough to work with Tara).

Dr. Samantha Thurman is the cornerstone of this place. I first met her over ten years ago at another practice, with another pet and unbelievably, when I brought my ailing chow chow in, she remembered me. That might not sound impressive, but honestly, I didn't remember her and if you compare the ratio of vets that I have dealt with to the number of clients she has over the years and you start to figure out at that her attention to detail is amazing.   The office is housed in a converted home, which honestly is one of the only downsides to visiting this practice because it results in an odd parking situation. But really that is quite minor.   The office doesn't have that "I'm in a vet's office" smell (hugs thumbs up) and is always clean. The staff is very nice and you actually believe they care about your pet. They have this really cool service where they take a picture of your four-footed baby and provide you with an ID card for each one that contains all the critical information you might need (age, vaccination history, weight, etc). The card is unbelievably helpful if you ever have to fill out one of those tomes at another office, because all the information is right there in your wallet. The service is free and they will provide you with your ID card on your first vaccination visit. If they don't, ask and they will do one up for you.   The things that make this practice stand out to me (in no particular order):  *Dr. Thurman herself. She is amazingly attentive each and every time I am there. She always asks about my other pets after she has completed her work up on the patient of the day. She NEVER makes me feel rushed or hesitates to respond to any of my neurotic pet-mom questions. She has an amazing circle of colleagues and has been able to put me in contact with leading specialists for my one little girl.  *There is always a vet-tech present during the exam. This may not sound like a lot, but I am always nervous about holding someone still or how they will behave during an exam and with the tech providing this support instead of myself, my pet is not picking up on my bad mojo.  *I don't feel overly pressured in to services. Don't get me wrong, she is incredibly thorough, but she doesn't make me feel like a loser when I opt-out of electives. She is also very good about providing all the information, in terms that I understand, so I can make an informed decision.  *Individualized treatment and care for special needs. I have one pet with some rather obvious social anxiety issues and Dr. Thurman offered up several options to help minimize the stress of his visits. I've grown used to his quirks, but who does this?!!   Overall - I am a huge fan of Dr. Thurman and Desert Sage. Prices are in line with what you would expect to pay for similar services and they have recently added one other veterinarian to the practice, but I haven't seen him, so I cannot comment on that. If I had any critique, it would be that it has more limited hours than I would prefer. This may change with the addition of the new Dr., but honestly the individualized care you receive is more in line with a boutique Clinique, so I can't complain and realistically, I have never had an issue with getting an appointment in a timely manner.   If you are in the central valley and in need of a great practice, give Desert Sage a try. I'm quite sure you and your furry / feathered / scaled one will be very pleased. : )

This review is specific to the culinary classes offered through the cafe.  Knowing the one thing that binds my eccentric/diverse work team together, is their overall love for eating and good food, my Über creative boss opted for a cooking class as a team building event.  We were each given Benedict's Cafe extensive course offering list and asked to pick those that we would be most interested.  The current list has over 30 offerings and I have to say I truly would have been pleased with any one of the options. The overall team opinion was for "Pizza from the Home Oven" and so it was.  We arrived at the cafe which is normally closed on Monday, but had been opened just for our private class. As others have mentioned, the cafe itself is quite small. But to be honest it feels more like what I am used to seeing in European cafe (walk up/take out). There is a counter full of delicious looking eye candy and a menu board with the available options for more substantial choices. The handful of bistro tables seem really more for convenience and there were some tables that appeared to be normally set up in the front of the cafe.  We were greeted by Chef Shock and after a brief wait for final preps in the kitchen we were whisked off (pun intended) to the back of the cafe. Chef could not have been nicer, or more welcoming. She gave us a brief background on her training (she graduated with honors from Le Cordon Bleu educated, has a gazillion specialty training courses under her apron, and is one of only 6 certified pastry chefs in AZ... kudos!) and as we would be nibbling the fruits of our labor as we went along, offered us a salad course paired with a fresh rosemary and olive focaccia to get us started. Both were wonderful and by now I for one was ready to get this pizza rolling.  There were 7 of us there, so we divided the prep work or shredding, chopping, slicing, and browning. Each of us was given individual instruction by Chef on the best execution approach and what would make the final product as good as it gets.   Chef had started the dough so it could begin proofing and after a little education on how something goes from one ewey gooey dough to either a beautiful and airy ciabatta, a light and tender focaccia, or the star of the day - pizza crust.  She worked up a sample crust, applied toppings in the ideal amounts and order - taking in to consideration moisture content, cooking limitations we would have to translate to home ovens, etc. and popped the first pie in the oven.  Then we each got started on our own versions. Flour flew, dough was tossed (and flopped in one instance - LOL), crusts were formed, toppings were and styles differed for each and within a very short time, all the pies were baking away. As a final example, Chef had us use some of the remaining ingredients to make a "bad pie" so that we could see what not to do.  When the flour settled, there were 8 beautiful pizza pies and 1 that was a little on the freakish side. We all sampled the creations and packed up our leftovers to take home.  Before our experience was over, Chef Shock started another batch of dough so we could see that process, divided up the dough to take home, gave us the recipe so we could play chef in our own kitchens, and served up some delectable chocolate chip cookies that she had baked for us before we arrived.  I went home stuffed with great food. Had a fantastic time getting to play with my coworkers in a completely different environment. Took home 2 heaping clam shells with pizza, dough to create something on my own, and a ton of extra toppings that we couldn't fit on our pies (oh and cookies). Seriously I could barely carry the haul to my car.  I can't remember having more fun, let alone a work event and am absolutely signing up for more courses (which you can register for on-line). The price is reasonable considering you get 3 hours of basically personalized instruction. Class sizes seem to range between 4 and 6, so there isn't much chance you would be ignored. Chef Shock told the group that if you have a group of 4 people interested in something specific, they will put together a private class for you and in those cases, ask about BYOB.  If you sign up for a class, let me know, I may join you... that is, if I haven't already made my way through the class list!  : )

Downsizing from a 4000 sq ft house to an 1100 sq ft home, combined with a propensity to buy things that I like without really knowing how they will work in my space led to a problem.  I had too much stuff and not enough room and no idea where to start, not to mention a great big mess.  After several attempts I finally realized organization is not my gift and I needed help.  So I searched around and stumbled across New Day Organizing.  Basically I wanted to  turn over the whole thing to someone that knew what they were doing and just step in when decisions needed to be made.  I explained what I was looking for and within one day I was contacted by Michelle.  From my first conversation I knew I had found the right people.  I described the situation and Michelle assured me that this was a completely obtainable goal.  I was more than a little nervous to have a stranger come in to my home and go through everything I own, but within the first few minutes I could tell that Michelle has a passion for helping people and was really good at what she does.  The speed at which she is able to go through things and sort them into categories is awe inspiring.  Every day she came she would work on a different space and before she left, it was clean, organized, and felt light and fresh.  I gave Michelle a key and on days when I was not able to be there, she would come and do her magic, leaving me notes of what needed to be decisioned, or would text me with questions.  The best part is that Michelle is a 'handy woman'.  She was able to fix bowing shelves and took care of those little things that get uncovered when you are doing a complete overhaul.  She provides a end to end service that begins with ick and with ahhhhh.  I simply don't have enough good things to say about this woman.  I am literally having her do my entire home and in the fall I will have her back out to do my detached garage.  If you need someone to help you organize your home or office space call New Day Organizing and ask for Michelle.  Your home will never look or function better and your mind will be free from all that clutter that you thought was only taking up space around you.  :)

So after working with New Day Organizing over the last six plus months, I thought I should update my review. In reality I would like to give them a 2.5 stars but I decided to round down for the following reasons.  My organizer Michelle was amazing.  I literally had a key made for her and she would come work as scheduled whether I was at home or not, based on a list of projects we had previously agreed upon.  I really don't have enough nice things to say about the quality of work that she did and her professional and kind approach to the work that she did.  As she was recently let go, I cannot speak to the performance of anyone else that works for the company and in re-reading my previous review, I realize that my rave was about this one employee and not the company itself.  I had several issues with the business itself; all around communication. First I was not made aware in writing about their cancellation policy until after I was told that I would be charged when I had not provided enough of a warning. And only then, did I receive the policy after I requested it in writing. This was not covered on the website or in any of the communications I recieved from the business owner.  So be warned, if you think you might need to cancel due to illness or emergency, you will pay a fee.  Secondly, 99% of the communication with the business owner is via text message.  Texting is great for chatting with friends. But anyone that has tried to conduct business via text will tell you that it is inadequate.  Perhaps having worked in the corporate world for most of my life I have relatively high expectations concerning the conduct how a business is run, but that said, I talked the owner about this (after I told her to call me in a marathon volley of texts) and expressed my concerns about the inadequacies of this form of communication.  The texts continued so I have to assume she didn't care about my opinion.  Thirdly, I was initially scheduling appointments directly with my organizer and then was quite abruptly texted that I needed to go through the owner and should not contact my organizer directly. At this point, my normally regular organizer became quite hit and miss, which I then discovered was because my weekly appointments had not been scheduled for the week or my appointment had been changed but I had not been made aware of the update.  Again this sort of thing doesn't fly with me. If I did this kind of thing at work I would be out of a job and I certainly expect more from a business owner. To be fair, the owner did comp me a four hour session, but this was after I insisted she call me and I advised her that I was going to leave as a client because I had made arrangements to take two days off of work to be at home and work with my organizer, only to have no one show up. She agreed this was her error and made the offer as a means of making up for the mistake.  Basically it comes down to this: care about your clients enough to pick up the phone and communicate clearly (i.e., do what you say and say what you are going to do). Simple. Right?!!  At the end of the day I am very happy that I found New Day Organizing because my organizer changed my life and for that I am very happy.  I just wish that I could have left this working relationship feeling like I could refer others to them for assistance and that isn't something I would do without A LOT of caveats.  :(

You can eat breakfast for breakfast. You can eat breakfast for lunch. You can eat breakfast in between and call it brunch. Regardless of when you eat it, I would suggest you eat it at Joe's diner!  Based on my recent meal here I would rate this somewhere closer to a 4.5 and tipping toward solid red stars. We arrived around one and received a very friendly greeting. I thought at the time it had been a long time since I received a genuinely warm hello simply upon entering. There was only one table occupied and in front of the gentleman was quite a fastastic looking array of food.  My friend and I both had more difficulty limiting our choices, than finding something that sounded off limits. Literally we probably could have closed our eyes and pointed and been happy.  BFF ordered one of the combo plates that came with eggs, biscuits and gravy, and a ginormous peice of grilled ham. I opted for the hash topped with fried eggs and my very own B&G. We both were wanted the full carb experience, as we are gearing up for a restrictive diet, so we opted to split a single cake at the very wise suggestion of the hostess/server/friendly hello giver/joe's wife. As the food arrives we dig in and all conversation ceases... well unless you count the intermittent "mmmm" and "ahhhh". Each item was better than the last. The hash was standard diner fare, but it was grilled until it was toasty brown, which set it apart. The eggs were prepared perfectly as defined by their handy menu guide alerting customers to their standards (soft wiggly vs. done with a slightly soft center). The B&Gs were uber good. The gravy is chock full of flavor, without being overly so and the biscuit held up to its liquid mate, which meant you could actually eat it without it becoming a gummy mess.  But the pancake. Oh the pancake. It was the star of the meal. It was fluffy and moist, topped with a beautiful blob of butter that actually was enough to cover the massive cake.  As others came in, it became very clear that coming to Joe's is like coming home for many people. Faces and names were recognized. Hugs were doled out, etc. Maybe someday I will be able to make it over to the lunch side of the menu, but for now Joe's Diner is moving in the to regular rotation for breakfast. For it's comfortable vibe, friendly family owned environment, and off the chart diner food - you will love it too!

This location is close to work so I was hoping it would be a great go to lunch spot.  There might be better options on the menu, so take my review or leave it, but with other options in the area, I won't go back unless I'm with a party and get over-ruled.  I had the make your own burger and opted for the small burger with grilled shrooms/onions and fresh jalepenos.  The burger was cooked as ordered and was decently flavored.  I chose the smashburger fries, which in concept sound great (drizzled with olive oil and rosemary), but I like crisp fries and mine seemed less drizzled and more doused or floating.  Adding a small drink and I was at $11.  The girl at the next table had a salad that looked fresh, but for the price, I thought seemed awfully skimpy.  My favorite thing about the place was the little metal basket things that the food was served in and unfortunately if the most memorable part of the meal is the utensils... there is a problem.  Save your money and head over to five guys.

Leo's does a really decent plate lunch. As for the people complaining about certain dishes, it's more a matter of expectation, rather than execution.  My brother in law is from the big island Hawaii... pidgin and all (which I secretly love when he breaks in to, but will deny if he asks), so I have heard all the stories about plate lunches and the time he ate three in one setting, etc. He LOVES a plate lunch and he likes the ones here. I'm trusting that he knows of what he speaks.  Yes the macaroni salad is bland. That is how they make it there. It is basically a ton of mayo, macaroni, a smidge of grated onion, and usually a hint of tuna. Basically you get additional flavoring from the grilled meat or add it with a little shoyu. If that doesn't sound like what you are "used" to getting, you probably aren't going to like it. But I have to say all that mayonnaise makes my heart sing.  I personally love the BBQ chicken and the lemon pepper chicken. Mostly because they are on the healthier side. If you order the lemon pepper chicken with no rice or salad and extra cabbage, it's low-carb and low calorie, in addition to being really tasty.  The chicken katsu is also very good. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. And my BIL likes the spam musubi. Well he likes any musubi actually. :)  Service is fast. The eating area is clean. The meals are cheap. And I actually like that there is no "corporate office" to complain to. If you want to eat at a chain, go somewhere else. This is family owned and operated.  I like Leo's. If you have a family, order the family dinner and pull up a chair, because you are going to be there a while. It's a lot of good food!

Would actually give a 2.5 and this review is on the venue only.  Went to see a show last night. There was a small line to get in. Maybe 10 people. It took 10 minutes. Considering that there is literally only one way in and they have been open as long as they have, I would think they could have worked out the kinks. It's a line people. Check the ID. Check the ticket. Done.  We arrived early enough that our seats were decent, but they seat you, even though there is no reserved seating and they will try to force you in to seats. Personally I didn't want to sit where I would have to look at the performers ass, so I said no and after an eye roll and a snarky "well where do you want to sit?" we were moved.  The two drink minimum is a hack, but normal and expected. We both had the martini of the day (carmel apple), which was so good that it also became my second drink. Small and pricey. But seriously good. The first thing my friend said after taking a sip was "okay I want to crawl in to this... is that bad?" It was that good.  We had eaten before arriving but because we wanted something to soak up the alcohol, we shared the chocolate cake. It was better than either of us thought it would be.  Service was odd, because the seating is so tight. The wait staff really can't make it through the rows, so they stand at the end of about 8 two-seater tables and pass things down. If you are claustrophobic or have personal space issues, DO NOT SIT in the middle of one of those rows. You will never get out.  About 15 minutes before the show was over the tabs were passed out, money collected, and the dishes / glasses are snatched up before the lights were raised. Since there is a line to exit too (again with the lines), we sat to let the crowd thin and basically were in the way as the tables were being bused.  I could see the need to pressure you out  if 1) there were a second show and they needed to change out the crowd, or 2) there was someplace to actually move your body; but leaving my table that was up by the stage / near the door and walking to the far rear of the venue to get in the back of the line didn't make sense.  The warm-up comics were great. The host for the evening was hysterical. The headliner was off the chain. The drinks were fabulous. The overall experience because of service was just okay.  I'll be back, because options are limited, but if the service were better, I would definitely go more often because it doesn't get much better than live comedy.

When my BFF when on a rave about this "olive oil place" that she had found, I thought to myself... hmmm sounds interesting, but I certainly wasn't breaking any speed limits to get there. And yet today I barely had one foot in the door when I realized the error of my dismissive ways! It wasn't that I didn't know these things existed. Quite contraire. But until now there was no place on the west side that one could do tastings and pairings. This is essential if you are a little obsessive about cooking.  I don't even quite know where to begin except to say that I seriously had to control my urge to buy one of each. And as the lovely couple that owns the establishment was packing up my case (yes I said case), I decided that this was potentially a dangerous place for me to frequent.  They have a selection of both nine plain - which is sort of a misnomer as you can make your selection from mild to robust flavors - and twelve flavored oils. Flavored oils that made the cut today were the all natural buttered which I have already lightly drizzled over steamed veggies and had I not known, would have thought I was being overly sinful. The owner suggested a light sprinkle over pop corn and I am SO there with her on that one! The next up was basil. Fresh and herby - the mix of the crisp OO combined with the sweet smoothness of the basil... well let's just say yum!  Garlic was the third one that made its way in to the box. This EVOO will be a staple in lightly flavoring the pan on anything Mediterranean or Italian that passes  across my stove top. The organic Tuscan herb is the obvious choice for dipping either crudites or crusty bread - this one is so popular they were temporarily out, so I was only able to sample. Trust me - I will be back for this one!  The final oil that came home was the one of the three specialty oils. I chose the toasted almond. This one is a couple of dollars more, but wow! This would be phenomenal for a healthier baking substitute, any kind of salad with a nutty flair, fruit... I swear you could drizzle this on ice cream.  And that leads me to the balsamics. They have 11 flavored traditional reds, 4 whites, and 3 specialties. Today I picked up the strawberry to pair with the basil OO. Sprinkle this combination over some watermelon with mint and no one will be able to resist you! I snagged the white cranberry pear for it's tart start with a sweet finish. I can't wait to use this in my fall recipes and have already started working up ideas for holiday meals that will star this little number. The dark chocolate is going to be perfect with strawberries and I'm pretty sure when paired with the toasted almond oil will be sublime.  When all was said and done, I had filled up the better part of a case and had a smile from ear to ear. Now looking back at their website I am kicking myself for not having tried at least 4 other items. I will have to settle for creating my own combinations of flavors until I return to add to the collection.  The best part of all of this is that is is actually reasonably priced for the quality, quite a decent value when you consider that you will be using teaspoons (or at most a tablespoon) to produce huge flavors, and is a vast improvement health-wise as a substitute for more traditional alternatives.  They have a punch card program that earns your free products and are open 7 days a week. I dearly hope people try this place and keep it afloat. It is without a doubt, my new crush!

I really do like this place. It's not Baker's, but seriously a close second. The plants feel a little more big box than Baker's which is why it doesn't get another star, but the space and other offerings are fabulous.  In addition, the staff is super friendly and they offer little things that make their service stand out. For example, they have these lovely little rolls of heavy gauge plastic to line your trunk or seats with, to prevent soil from getting everywhere. They have these super convenient carts that have a pivoting top shelp, which makes buying tall things really easy.  They have one of the nicest selections of glazed pots around. I'm already finding this to be a little bit of a problem, since I have now decided that I need to change out all of mine because the ones I bought are so darn pretty and colorful.  Parking can be a little iffy, when crowds overflow from the neighboring businesses. I was intrigued at how a nursery could set up a workable space at the end of a strip mall, but they did a nice job.  This has replaced the big box shops for when I need something quick and I have a feeling that they will be seeing a lot more of me in the spring.

I have purposely held off writing a review of this spot thinking that perhaps my four visits were anomalies and not the norm but after my last experience on Saturday I have decided that in fact that it just isn't going to get any better... so here we go. Yes the Rosa and the Sonny Boy are sublime. In fact there are a handful of things on the menu that I believe don't get any better.  But there enough things on the menu that are done equally as well or better elsewhere that they lose their first star and are down to 4.  Ambiance is actually nice.  In fact it is quaint, with the home like feel of the two rooms, resulting from what used to be the two restaurants in one concept that they thankfully abandoned. This location is far more roomy than their other venues, which is really appreciated, unless you are one of those people that doesn't mind squeezing around the door and straddling the seat to get into your allotted 2 sqft. Nice doesn't warrant a bump, so we are holding at 4 stars.  Service is what kills this location. Yes, I know you believe you are local food gods but refer to my first point... you are very good in some areas and lacking in others, so if you want to rate five stars then you are going to have to kill on service and well you do sort of, just not in the way that is good.  So once again, the meal took on a sort of combative feel and to quote Patton Oswalt's stand up that came later in the evening, "I'm so pissed right now, but I can't wait to see how this all plays out."  As a customer, I shouldn't feel "beholding" to get a table at 5:10 p.m. on a Saturday.  When I walk in and you have a total of 4 tables, do you have to sit my party of five at the smallest four-top in the restaurant?  Should the waiter come to the table three times, blurt out some information and dash off to his other table without so much as asking for drink orders? When our party asked if we could move to one of the larger tables that might actually accommodate food for five people, is it required to hold an adhoc summit meeting in the corner, comprised of five wait staff, the GM, and the hostess all glaring at our table and whispering?  Hint: If you don't want people to know what you are saying, just move your bodies into the other room...  (Down .5 stars for invoking the spirit of a cold war peace talk)  Should the hostess come to speak at length to our table and condescendingly explain that ALL of the other tables are reserved so the larger four-tops aren't available because the parties are coming in at 6:45 and I'm assuming she didn't think our party could eat in under 1.5 hours?  After expressing that we could probably meet the time requirements for a larger table if someone were to actually take our order, we were ushered over to a different table with grand Downton ceremony. (Down 1 more star for tainting my favorite show and making this feel like we were a Make-A-Wish kid being granted their final request)  And then apparently we had been branded the "trouble table" because we were now under the care of the GM and experienced peripheral glances from the entire wait staff.   At least service picked up at this point.  We were able to place our order, which may have included more items but we knew we were under the gun and had to vacate the table before 6:45, so we stuck with simple and straight forward and quite frankly I think we all just wanted to eat and get out of there by that point.  Amazingly we had only been at the restaurant for fifteen minutes and we had gone through what seemed like a full month's worth of soap-opera drama and long staring pauses.  If only we had the appropriate soundtrack to fill out the backdrop...  Net result 2.5 stars.  The food came out quickly but considering the number of patrons and the simplicity of our order (four pizzas), this didn't seem like a Herculean effort.  The GM poked his head around the corner for a peek or hovered around the table at approximate four minute intervals, plates were whisked away at an alarming rate and at 6:08 p.m. we left the restaurant.  Fifty-eight minutes of some of the most uncomfortable dining experience possible.  So my fifth visit will be my last.  If you want CB's food, go to one of the two other venues in the city and pass on this one.  Or just go to one of the other local, less glorified, spots that are on par with his pizza and where you don't have to take on a submissive stance for the privilege of eating.  Hint:  You are honored by the presence of your customers and exist at their whim.  Not the other way around.  :(

I'm a pretty big fan of this place.  Yes the ordering can be a little time consuming, but when you consider that by the time you reach the end of the line, you are handed over a freshly baked casserole chocked full of yummy goodness, it sort of makes up for it all.  So there are a few things you should know when ordering.  1) You can get nachos.  They're not on the board, but they will make them up and they are delish (and big).  2) The soup is awesome.  I wish they offered more than one size but it is tasty and built to your tastes, just like everything else.  3) The spicy cornbread filling should be nominated for its own food group.  This is seriously the best thing that I have tasted in a really long time.  4) The grapefruit margarita is fantastic.  Perfectly crisp and refreshing for our super-hot summer days, do yourself a favor and get one or two (or three).  5) The pumpkin cookies with touch of caramel frosting is a must have.  It is the optimal ending for the meal and since it's not heavy, it's a great topper.  The staff is friendly.  The space is clean.  The food is fantastic.  Yep, I'm a pretty big fan!

I like this new location.  The floor plan is more open and it feels bigger than their previous location on 19th Ave.  The food is the same, so if you like IHOP you will probably be satisfied on that point.  I've been here for five visits at various times and there are a couple of things that are consistent that rate a 2 or 2.5 rating:  1) parking is awful and entry is confusing unless you know where you are going.  2) They run out of food.  Twice I've been there and unless you get there really early, you might find that your favorite is no long available for the day.  3) The service is awful.  They seem to have a 1 to 3 ratio on employees to guests and still the service is awful.  If you need your fix of rootie tootie fresh n fruity (or whatever) pick another location and save yourself a lot of frustration.

So I'm a huge fan of Robson's other spot (yet I get the irony) Gallo.  The menus are basically the same as is the high quality of food.  And coffee is from Lux so if you need a little caffeine with your chiliquilles (my preference is the veggie option slathered in the green salsa)  then don't hesitate.    This is a little quieter than Gallo but it is also a little more sterile feeling.  There is a warmth to GB that isn't here with the white walls and massive windows but that said the parking is far better, the food is the same high quality, and the hours are a little broader which makes for big appeal.  I'm just happy to have multiple locations to get some of Robson's yummy creations. :)

Writing this actually makes me sad.  I would actually like to rate it a 2.5 but I'm being kind and rounding up because I am hugely appreciative of what they have done with the building.  That being said when architecture is the 1st thing that comes to mind when talking about a restaurant, there is probably some room for improvement.  The usage of the space is remarkable. It's a very trendy looking place with warm tones and despite it being one large open room, they were able to pull off at least the appearance of intimacy. But that's where the warmth stops.  The deafening mix of customer driven music selection is way too loud. It is almost impossible to hear anyone even at a small four top without leaning in and utilizing your best lip reading skills.  And if the owners could limit the techno trance options to maybe 1/3 of the options, I would gladly toss in another half star.  The bar is spectacular however, so if you just want someplace to just soak in the atmosphere, park yourself under the magnificent chandelier and drink it in.  The menu is less than user friendly.  Everything listed is ala carte, however there seem to be combos available which only appear to be available to people on the inner circle.  We even asked if there was a possibility of getting a quesadilla (since tortillas and cheese are key components of several items) and were told that if it's not listed on the menu, it is not available.  The prices are way out of line with other similar venues.  The tacos are $4 per and they are the smallest street tacos I have seen in a very long time. They are not bad. They are just four bites and that is way too steep.  The burros are reasonably priced for what you get, so go with one of those if you don't eat like America's Next Top Model. The salsas (both fresh and bottled) are good but the chips come straight out of a bag and that irritates me. If you are going to sell yourself as a gastropub, you need to be able to carry off the "gastro" portion of the title. Everything else seems fresh, why would you chintz on the chips?!!  And the $8 guacamole? It's ok but no more. Yes it's fresh and clearly made on site but it is not worth even half that. I love that you can select chunky or smooth but that is where the love story ends.  Service is my final pick point. Our order taker was very friendly, but the four other people that sporadically delivered food left a lot to be desired.  There was a five minute lag between the first taco hitting our table and the last burro... unacceptable; and then we had to ask for the guacamole that was delivered and then were told they had given it to another table by mistake. They took that off the check but it just added to the already uneven service.  So I will probably give it another try after they have had some time to work the kinks out.  And I truly hope they do. Like I said, I'm unbelievably happy they have saved the building and I like what they have done with it for the most part. Now if they could just bring the food up to level of the space and work on the service it would be great place to hang out.

You can eat breakfast for breakfast. You can eat breakfast for lunch. You can eat breakfast in between and call it brunch. Regardless of when you eat it, I would suggest you eat it at Joe's diner!  They may have moved locations, but you still can't beat their breakfast sandwich!  I have never had anything that I could say was bad at Joe's.  I once said that I could close my eyes and point at the menu and end up with something yummy.  I am still pretty sure that holds true.  Portions are large and probably not the healthiest but if you are going to splurge on breakfast, you might as well have one of their fabulous buttermilk pancakes, or biscuits and gravy (which you can have with spicy chorizo if you choose), or one of their combos, or that breakfast sandwich that I literally dream of...  like I said close your eyes and point.  You won't be disappointed.

As far as water places go, this one is pretty fantastic.  The owner is very friendly.  They have Thrifty ice cream which is a big thumbs up when you want to be a little bad but they also have fresh raw juices and smoothies when you want to be a little good.  This is definately not your run of the mill water store and I go out of my way to visit this spot. :)

Karl's is one of the best places to get baked goods in the Phoenix area. They have a huge selection of standards and also feature seasonal offerings such as hot cross buns, linzer tortes, and monkey bread. Each month Karl and his daughter come up with a new cronut flavor combination, all of which are creative and melt in your mouth good. Karl's daughter has a selection of fine chocolates as well in part of the shop. The baker's daughter features some outstanding flavor combinations that highlight the chocolate in beautifully designed bites as well as seasonal offerings. My favorite thing to get at Karl's are the apple fritters. These are just chocked full of tasty apple bits, glazed to perfection, and literally the size of an adult human head. Hide behind one of these tasty bad boys the next time you need some camouflage!! Overall, Karl's Quality Bakery is a fantastic locally owned and run business. Look for Karl sitting out at one of the little bistro tables next time you stop in and ask him for his pick of the day. :)

When the best thing you can say about a venue is that it looks nice, you're not saying much. The employees are useless. Don't bother trying to get a drink upstairs. The fully stocked lovely bar only serves VIPS and at this show that means there is a total of one bar tender, a bar back, and two waitresses for the total of five VIP guests. Don't get me wrong they offer service but it just sucks! The spanx-sporting, tooth pick with a weave took my drink order, but she never brought it and didn't have the decency to say she wouldn't. Getting in is like you are in Manhattan or LA. News flash... you're not!! You are one of a revolving door of venues in south Scottsdale. So basically the place is all flash with no delivery. Why would anyone ever come back here!?!!

I'm so excited that they've resurrected themselves! The place is small but the old favorites are back and the owner and staff are so nice. I also like that everything is right up front, so you can actually see them creating your splendiferous treat. The food is gone from the menu but I don't think anyone will hold that against them when they get one bite of the salted caramel cashew. Definitely will work this place into my rotation of "gotta have something sweet" spots.
