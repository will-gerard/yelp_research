I had been taking my kids to this office for 14 years. I have seen all the doctors at this location.  After 14 years we had developed a relationship with everyone there.  Today, we were literally 7 minutes late to the appointment and we were refused service by Dr. Wallace.  This was probably our first time being late, and yes we should have not been late.  However, there was nobody else waiting to be seen, and we have had to wait for the doctor plenty of times ourselves.  This was just mean and thoughtless behavior.  We will take our 14 year relationship somewhere else!!!

Delicious vegan options, even a daily vegan soup! This place is the best, modern, most forward thinking restaurant in Scottsdale! I'm in love! The service is always wonderful, and v quick! This is a must try! I recommend the Thai dye wrap! The hummus is incredible, too!  My favorite restaurant!
