LOCAL BREWERY - Never as good as Tempe location but still great!!!  Went last night during Thursday Nigh Football Cards vs. Rams game - place was packed out - standing room only & hour wait. Our friends (regulars) told us the trick is to come around half time and the place starts to clear out - sure enough that was the case.   Lots of big screens to enjoy the game on - and they've got the pumpkin porter rocking right now so you have to swing through if your in the area - not a huge fan of pumpkin anything but THEIR porter is delicious!  Had the Fish-n-chips, which the batter is made in their Kilt Lifter brew - a favorite when drinkinng Scottish ales - 6% ABV

Really enjoy the salon - great location - friendly staff - not too crowded and across the street from Eddie's House (Happy hour after a fresh cut is highly recommended). The price is $40 which could be considered high for a men's cut by some but I think it's more than fair for a quality cut.   I've always had a hard time holding down a hairstylest that actually get's my hair and can pull it off. Guy cuts are supposed to  be easy, or so people tell me, but I've got to say just pulling off a decent cut on me is pretty difficult. I don't have bad hair or anything I just have a lot of hair and cowlicks which can be a real hassle to manage for a no-hassle type of guy.  I go to a stylist named Lisa and have for over a year now. .. Not only is she professional but her energy is awesome.  She takes the time to work with my hair so the cut is quality--don't get me wrong I wear hats a lot but when I meet with clients I need to look professional and Lisa makes it easy for me to accomplish. And my girlfriend has used her too!  I would AND DO recommend this salon / Lisa to anyone looking for a good cut in the area.

If you're looking for a bar / grill where everybody knows your name this is it...  Great little joint with big savings on really great food. Side Door shares a kitchen with Uncle Sal's which is some of the best Italian food I've had in the valley. (Sal's - is a great date spot).  I recommend the sliders... $2.50 - are you kidding me? packed with fresh meat and they'll even let ya swap out ingredients if you ask - I prefer: Corned Beef, with Swiss, some grilled onions and topped off with Thousand Island dressing.  Their short ribbed dumplings are killer! & of course the pizzas are always great - also if you're from Chicago they've got you covered on the Chi-dogs!  The best part is there's live music a couple nights a month & they have a liquor license that lets them sell to go!!! That's right people - I head over sometimes just to grab a six pack - mix & match your own domestic & imports for only $8.50! Some of the beers they have are hard to find - my fav right now is Goose Island's Matilda Belgian Ale. SO GOOD!!!  The staff are friendly - I'm a little biased because my GF bartends their (Amber), but we've been going to the place long before she worked their :) The regulars are great fun and it's just an all around great joint to add to the list.   Don't miss out on this local treasure & remember to sit at the bar & strike up a conversation cause everyone wants to know your name! I'll probably be there :)

GREAT SPOT - LOCALLY OWNED & IT SHOWS!!!  the Owner Oz is great & take's pride in his establishment... they keep the menu pretty fresh with new items always popping in for the season and they have my favorite local micro-brew - ORANGE BLOSSOM!!!    Their Happy Hour is the REAL DEAL - Try the Pulled Pork Sandwich while your there  When you're looking for a great spot to watch Football on the weekends this is as good as it gets - Jumbo screens and multiple TV's with multiple bar setups & it's close to Tempe but not directly slammed in all the traffic - which is a plus to me. Great bar to catch a BEARS game at on Sundays and a University of Texas spot on Sat's but I'm Michigan so ya won't find me there :)  For those that need a patio like myself - prepare yourself... its freaking HUGE & looks out across the courtyard. If you're trying to switch it up from the typical Oldtown Weekend and don't want to go as far as Mill It has a pretty decent night life - doubles up as a club / lounge late night on some weekdays & weekends - great DJ's & they even get some pretty decent live entertainment.  Def worth a stop if you're in the area whether its just for a quick drink before a movie or you're having a full meal.

Finally made it to Butters this AM - wish I had made it out sooner - THE FOOD WAS GREAT!  I had the Eggs Benedict Florentine w/ Breakfast Sausage and Cheese Grits. I don't normally order Eggs Benedict when I'm eating out because most places just don't seem to get it right - not the case here and they actually offer a variety of options in how you can have it.   I brought a friend / colleague for an early AM session - they open at 630 (that's a plus) - we both ate comfortably for $20 plus tip.   Service was good - the staff was kind - portions generous, combined with the overall experience was what will be keeping me coming back!!!

So this is my current Sunday All day Happy Hour JAM!  This place is SO GOOD and I'm not a huge fan of all off Fox Restaurants concepts.  The Chefs Pizza of the day hasn't let me down yet... We don't even ask we just order it!  The Chefs Board is pretty good too! My fav dish right now is the Broccolini - super simple but it's just so light / fresh and make sure you try the Bucatini & Meatballs if your their for happy hour.   Awesome open feel to it - super friendly staff. The bartenders are great - I wanna say the dark haired brunets name was Nicole - works weekends & knows how to make a mean bloodymary / Red Rooster in their case.   The parking / Valet situation is a little annoying but remember the sign says "Complimentary" not Mandatory - park your car yourself if you want.

IF YOU LIKE CRAFT BREWS DON'T MISS OUT ON THIS ONE!  Been dying to finally get out to Gilbert and give this place a try but we hesitated due to it being out in Gilbert  DIRECTIONS - DISTANCE: **** To my surprise the drive from Oldtown Scottsdale wasn't bad at all - about 15 mins - straight down the 101 to E Guadalupe Rd and you're there! SO WORTH IT and not a bad drive at all.   =====================================================  ATMOSPHERE: ***** Great atmosphere out of nowhere - you can't really tell what to expect walking up but once your inside you feel like you're right on Mill Ave w/ out the sometimes expected Douchery which is great - everyone is laid back - good diverse mix of patrons and overall good vibe. They had the World Cup playing on all the TVs which scores extra points!  ========================================================  FOOD: **** I ended up just combining some starters - I went with the CHICKEN WINGS CONFIT, dry rub with Beer-B-Q sauce on the side (Delicious). The meat literally falls of the bone. And I had a side of the BELGISCHE FRIETJES (which is fries cooked in duck fat).... so good.  Also - they have vegetarian options as well which was a plus for some of our party.  Great Beer food overall   =========================================================  BEER: ***** + * While the menu is limited this is why you make the trip people - I had the:  - Denmark in The Desert Imperial Sour Peach Porter Collab with Mikkeller - (not a porter guy in 100+ temps but I gotta say that this was pretty awesome) Not overly dark or thick - very smooth and has a great aftertaste... goes great w/ the FRIETJES.   - Hellsgate Imperial Saison - 9.0% - What can I say about the Imperial - Was as good as it gets!!! Make sure you have a designated driver for this one :)  AGAIN Don't make the trip if you're expecting to be able to buy a Heineken - that's not going to happen and that's not what the place is about - this is a Micro Brew trying new flavors and constantly coming out w/ new craft brews - that's the point!!!   ==========================================================  SERVICE: ***** Last but not least the staff was awesome - They kept the fresh cold beer flowing despite the place being packed out - made great recommendations for everyone on the food - pairing it up with our beers - couldn't have been happier   WE'LL BE BACK!

Finally made it!!!  Location is great / menu and tap selection is great!  Wanted to give more stars on this one so bad...   The problem is no matter how much our friends swear we must have caught an off-night I've seen other complaints on here about the soup being way too salty! Also the service was lacking - we had to wait way too long between beers for refills and the pasties were dry if you ask me.   I'll be giving it another try because I want it to work out so badly - were the hell else are you gonna get bangers-n-mash in Oldtown.  Keep ya posted and hopefully upgrade some stars on this one.

Bout time!  The "salty soup" issue seems to have been fixed - the Mushroom, Walnut, and Spinach soup is def worth your time. My girlfriend and I like to split it as an app before we order main course.   Beer selection is still good - and servers are good about letting you sample a beer or swap out if you get the bottom of the keg...  Service on the patio can still be slow at times but I think overall it's a fresh selection / experience for Oldtown - glad I could throw up the extra stars!

Earlier this year Tom and Lin catered my sisters rehearsal dinner and her wedding cake / cupcakes!  It was amazing!!! The rehearsal dinner had a flash cook pasta bar where everyone could select their own dishes for the cooks to prepare. One of the better rehearsal setups I've seen and I highly recommend it. I wish the wedding itself had offered this :)   Their pricing is more than reasonable considering the quality of ingredients (which you can negotiate when determining the menu style).  I highly recommend their smoked kalamata olives if you have them do horderves. Random but trust me - so good!  Can't say enough about these two. The menus Chef Tom creates are amazing and the service and support Lin provides not to mention her deserts are as good as you can get.  Great local AZ biz to support!
