Oxymoron: a fast food restaurant that makes people wait till their food is served before they will give you your drink up... and then forget to give it to them half the time and make them wait for you to come back to give it to you.  This is the only McDonalds I have been in that does this.  It is around the corner from my house but I drive further away to save time.  Tried it again today to see if they had changed and still the same way.

Have been using commercial mail boxes for years.  Moved from North Scottsdale to Old town area and my old box location was becoming a pain to check.  They also had reduced staff to one person and there was always a line.  Checked a couple of locations closer to me for a move.  This location always had multiple employees who were friendly.  I rented a box here a month ago.  The service since has continued to be excellent:  fast, attentive and friendly.  Other post have complained about the costs of shipping.  For me, it is worth the convenience and making sure it is shipped properly.

DQ is a great place to go for family celebrations.  We like the outside seating but tonite there were 3 ladies smoking like crazy. Otherwise, had a great time with great treats.

Went shopping here specifically because they had a couple of meat items on sale that I wanted. Second time trying both times they are out of the sale items. This time talk to the butcher behind the counter and he just shrugged and said if it's not out we don't have it. When I asked about a rain check he said they order but if it sells out it's out. Did get a rain check from the cashier but doubt I will be going back. I will be shopping at my frys and bashas where they know what customer service is and have sale items in stock. Just wanted to mention most of the reviews I do on Yelp are positive. I am NOT just a negative poster bashing everyone.

Rudy went above and beyond. He turned a frustrated customer into a happy customer. When the 'solution' didn't make any sense and would have made me jump through a bunch of hoops, he went the extra step. After making a quick phone call he was able to offer a different solution to make it easier for everyone.

Was pleasantly surprised for a "discount" theater. $3 for a end of run movie and the concessions are reasonable compared to regular theaters.  The last time I was at a discount theater I was afraid to touch anything due to the filth.  It was basically clean and had a cool theme of movie character statues through the lobby.  Tuesdays are $2 so it gets even better.  My daughter and I can go and have a good experience with concessions for less than $15 compared to $30 plus the last regular theater we went to.

They recently moved and I was afraid it would change the experience... it did, it is even better now.  We had calzones, pasta and mozzarella sticks.  They were all fantastic.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  The space is bigger now so they can serve even more people.

Don't try to use the. 'post office' here. If you have anything other than shipping they are unwilling to help.

If you have food challenges, Chipotle is great. My daughter has food sensitivities and they were very patient and accommodating.

My daughter was going to her Jr High formal and the person who was going to help her with her hair wasn't able to do it.   I was calling places close to her school and getting the run around.  Looking a little further away on Yelp I discovered the Pampered Pinkie with good ratings and reviews.  They were accommodating and excited to help her with her special day.  We arrived and I pleasantly surprised at the energy of the place.  It was not sterile like so many salons or some trendy, high tech, metallic experience.  Megan was wonderful and asked my daughter lots of questions about her outfit, shoes, likes/dislikes, etc.  Highly recommended for a personal, heart-felt experience.

UPDATE! The manager of the location, Sarah, called and was extremely apologetic and very gracious.  She was upset that I was made to pay for this haircut.  My intention was not get anyone fired and that is not what happened... the person quit without notice and is no longer a stylist there.  She was there for only 3 days and I just wanted to update my review as she is NOT a reflection of my experience there and I have been going there for a couple of years.  If that stylist had continued to work there, I would not have gone back as the review below does not actually reflect just how bad that person treated me.  Also, I wanted to clarify that it was not because of a bad Yelp review that they acted.  I used the contact form on the company website and Sarah reached out to me based on that.  A company cannot control all of their employees all the time... humans will be humans and i feel Sarah handled the situation very professionally and to my satisfaction.  I will be giving them another chance to keep my business and, based on my experiences prior to this one stylist, I imagine I will be happy with the haircut and the extra treatment Sports Clips offers.  Worst haircut of my adult life! I used to get my haircut here fairly regular probably won't ever be back. They had me in the system for an inch and a half on the sides 2 inches on the top. She took the razor and went down the side and I felt like I had just entered the military. When I said something about it she said that is one and a half inches that is the attachment I used. Later she said it was a mistake on the notes and they had it down as a number one attachment. Funny thing is that never happened before. I doubt it is even a quarter inch as I can barely even pinch the hair on the side of my head. The challenge is my hair goes spiky when it is too short and so I will have to deal with that for the next few weeks as it grows back. Wouldn't be as big a deal but I have a YouTube series I am supposed to be recording over the next two weeks. And this is not a confidence booster.

New experience with my daughter's allergies. 2 thumbs up. If you have allergies, Red Robin is a great place to go.

Found this gem by accident today. My daughter has food allergies so I wanted to see how they could accommodate her. Met the owner and he was extremely nice and helpful. Brought my daughter back this evening and we give it 4 thumbs up. Fresh ingredients blended in a thoughtful fashion to make wonderful sandwiches. Will be back regularly.

My daughter has several food allergies making it difficult to eat out. We are always looking for new options. She wanted to see if this place had anything she could eat. The cashier was extremely nice trying to determine if there was any options. She turned it over to Sterling who researched every ingredient for her allergies and came up with an  improvised dish and then personally prepared it. Above and beyond. Thanks.
