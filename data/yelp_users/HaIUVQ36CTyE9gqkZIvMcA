Standard Jack in the Box restaurant. I came here a couple weeks ago for a quick lunch stop. I walked in, stood at the counter, and waited roughly 10 minutes before I had my order taken. In the meantime, a line was forming behind me  The service was not very prompt; I waited an additional 8 minutes or so before I got my food. This is not a place to stop by if you're in a hurry or looking for fast service. Lesson learned.

I wish I could rate Dr. Cohen separately from the business itself. Dr. Cohen is a fantastic doctor and I always feel taken care of when I see her.   I have had great difficulty with the bookkeeping part of this business. The office insists on billing me for services my insurance carrier, United Healthcare, indicates I am not responsible for. United Healthcare has tried to call the office 4 times and has not been able to talk to anyone in person. It seems voice mail is the only option offered. Both UHC and I have left numerous voice mails and cannot seem to get this rectified. Healthy Oulook's unwillingness to go the extra mile to resolve this has resulted in a new bill, including a late fee, indicating the unpaid amount, $114.89, is being sent to a collection agency.   I am not sure if there is a state agency who can help me with this (Department of Insurance?). but I may have to look into filing a complaint somewhere. Healthy Outlook had agreed to accept my insurance. United Healthcare tells me this is not my responsibility, however, Healthy Outlook chooses not to return calls to either of us.   I think Dawn Cohen is a great doctor, but beware if you expect them to be your advocate when dealing with insurance issues.

Updating! So, the dispute was resolved at this office, but I truly believe, even after all this time, that this situation should never have progressed this far! I'm not sure I believe the integrity of this office is as great as they claim, as I feel I had been strung along and made to believe false information while trying to handle my claim (which I should have never gotten!). I have never, ever, EVER had a problem with my insurance, and I do believe this office was not fully truthful with me. I have since taken my business elsewhere to avoid the headache that this all was. ((Now, I know Healthy Outlook will reply to this comment, making my information seem less -serious- than it actually was, and I totally understand that. Keeping up with the customers, I get it. I just will never come back to this office again.))

I am never, ever unhappy leaving Lemy Nails! The space is a little cramped, but the quality of work makes up for it. I have become a regular and always leave with a fabulous manicure (or pedicure!) There is usually no wait time, so that works out great for me and my busy schedule.   Card payers, make sure you bring a little extra cash! You cannot add a tip to your card.   Overall, Lemy Nails is a great place! I don't go anywhere else to get my nails done!

Very clean, nice atmosphere, usually quiet. I've been here once for boba and was not disappointed! The service did seem a bit sparse, hence my rating of 4 stars. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant.

All of the artists here are fantastic! I have work by Justin, Cameron, and Cameron's apprentice, Ivy. They are all very professional and pricing is very fair. My experience has always been very positive. They always work to make sure you are comfortable and happy with the tattoo (or piercing) you leave with. I highly recommend this shop!

Oh my goodness! My ABSOLUTE favorite place for coffee! The staff here is always friendly. Always! Their positive energy always rubs off on me and makes my day better. There's 2 lines here, so I usually get through pretty quickly! I know that the wait can sometimes be a little much, so come ahead just in case! Preparation is key, and the service and drinks here are definitely worth the extra wait! Yummy coffee, amazing people, definitely one of my favorite weekly (and sometimes more) stops!

Not the most amazing sushi, but it definitely worked for my sushi craving! (It is mall food after all). At $5 for 2 trays, you can't beat that! The staff was very friendly and service was quick.

Wide selection of juices, great customer service, discounts for a student like me, good selection of mods, super knowledgeable staff, how can you go wrong?!  The atmosphere is great and I am always welcomed with a smile and eagerness to help. Definitely a keeper.
