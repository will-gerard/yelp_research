Extremely pleased with the service I received. Felt genuine and honest. Scott and Dave had no problem explaining issues in Laymans terms for me. I also wasn't pressured into repairs I didn't come in for. Oil change was $30 and well worth it. I'll be back in 3000 miles for sure.

Was very surprised with my experience with Antonio, considering the other reviews before me. I entered the shop with a standard comb over, about 2 inches long, with a #2 faded up. I left with a buzz cut.  Here are my two complaints. First, all requests I gave as I set down were completely cut and dropping to the floor seconds in. I want to blame this on the language barrier, mainly because he was nice enough for me to assume he wouldn't just ignore a clients request. There shouldn't be a mound of hair on the floor, when all you request is a trim...  Secondly, after twice denying Antonio's request to shape up my beard, I gave in to his THIRD advance. I will admit the hot towel and massage would have been enjoyable if I hadn't already been in a state of shock. In the end, the left side of my beard is a half of an inch higher than my right. He's really good at spinning the razor around in his hand though!   $45 dollars later and upset by my experience enough to lose sleep over it, here I am. Thanks Antonio.

Did a great job with grinding our skittish dog's nails, cost us $15 bucks though. Very clean shop, lots of high quality accessories and foods
