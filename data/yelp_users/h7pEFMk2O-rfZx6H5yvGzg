This is my least favorite yarn shop. The only reason I ever go is because it is close. Dragonfly yarn isn't too far away & worth the drive. Most of the staff is unfriendly with the exception of the British (I think) woman. She is a major asset to the shop. Wish she worked at another LYS.

The staff here is very nice. They have a large selection of gel colors. The quality of work is great and prices are reasonable. What more could a girl want? I look forward to going back very soon.

I recently moved to the area and wanted to check a few places out for my manis and pedis.  This was my first spot, and I am not looking any further. Their customer service is great. The prices are very affordable. Chairs are comfortable. I am definitely going back soon!

I Love this Pita Jungle! The staff is friendly and food amazing. I often get it to go. My family occasionally eats at the restaurant as well. We have never had a negative experience.
