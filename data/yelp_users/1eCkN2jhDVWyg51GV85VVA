Ok, lets be honest. Casinos are places of desperation, seedy experiences, lost dreams, and just downright hilarity. I love casinos. I am in no way a compulsive gambler, addict, or junky of any sort so I feel my reviews of casinos can be quite frank and honest from an outsiders perspective.  This place sucks!!!  It is filled with people hooked up to respirators with their filthy wigs and blue hairs. There is nothing "bling" about this place and its genuinely old, dirty, and depressing.   The slot machines are a haven for old timers to pump away their social security checks and their grandchildrens inheritance. The machines don't pay out and when you win more than 200 bucks it has to be hand delivered to you.   Indians casinos always suck  - this place is no exception.

Why did you ever leave me Schlotzsky's?   I wish you would come back to Chicago. You are missed here.   This place has warm, fresh, soft bread. This place has delicious meats, fresh ingredients, and hearty helpings.  I recommend the reuben or the original.   This particular location has a larger, cafeteria style seating area. When I went there was a large crowd of blue-haired old-timers reading the paper and hanging out.

I wish I had written this review sooner. I was told this was the place to go by my friend and local meat eating specialist.   I'm really, really glad we went. There is something about Arizona barbeque. Its delicious, its tender, its different. This place is the best example of it that I have had the pleasure to consume.   I love the atmosphere. Its old town southwestern and roomy.

It is only lacking the 5th star for the prices. They are a little too high for the amount of food - but the quality and service are the best you can find anywhere for breakfast food.    I went on a friday morning around 10:30 and still had a wait. I am told to expect a wait no matter what. Its a very good idea to check this place out if you are around town.
