I was one of 50 people who went there to get Adam's Big Unit.  The service was top notch and they move fast and get work done.  And the hot dog was sooooo huge and soooooo good.  I shared my picture of eating the big unit with Sebastian Bach and he commented back on it because it was so enormous!  It had great flavor and my favorite brioche bread.  I will be going back to attempt the dog on my own.  I am a tall skinny girl but I have a true appetite so I will definitely get that 22" hot dog down no problem.  I highly recommend Cooperstown.  It is a great place to have good food and have a great time!

I refuse to eat at a restaurant where you stole 98% of your menu from another restaurant and just changed the names!  Shame.  Wish I could give zero stars

I'm shocked at myself that I ate here, but it was a last resort due to me needing to take Adam to the airport.  I've been to Chuys in Tucson for dinner, which is always have had a good experience with it being that it is a total hole in the wall.  But did anyone know that they had breakfast?!  Well they do.  So we went in and weren't expecting the world knowing what the place was.  We sat ourselves because there was no staff in sight and just 2 older people at the bar, at 8am lol.  So we sat for a few minutes and then a girl came to us.  She got our drinks and then we told her we were ready to order and she said that they don't do table service and she would meet us at the register.  My mind was boggled because there were only 2 other customers in there who were done eating.  How could she not think that she should just take our order with ALL the time she had instead of making us walk ALL the way across the restaurant to place an order for a whole 2 burritos.  So I give her zero stars!  I give the burritos 3 stars because they weren't the best I've ever had but they were good enough and they didn't give me a tummy ache!  So I give a total of 2 stars because of the servers one star.  Chuys is always going to be a good choice for mesquite when you need a quick bite!

I go here 3 or 4 times a week to get my all natural healthy foods.  The staff always remembers me and treats me so well.  The biggest issue at grocery stores is when there is a line of people and the staff doesnt open another lane, drives me nuts!!!  At this store, you will never see more than 3 people in line.  Their prices are great and the quality of produce is always on point.  Go Bashas

I've worked in the industry for over 15 years and I have never seen such pathetic service, or lack there of.  I have told TONS of people to stay away.  I walked in and after 5 minutes of sitting, by the bar, by the POS system that 4 waitresses were using, I finally got a water.  Then I sat there for over 15 minutes and I was never approached.  They walked by me over 20 times and didn't say a word to me.  I can't rate the food because I was never served but there was no service!  You must be a regular for them to care that you are there or you must be in a pre paid party!  I will never stip into this place again and I will continue to tell everyone I know to stay away.

My favorite style of food is easily italian and I especially love alfredo and pizza w/ wings.  Red Devil has that and more!  I was skeptical about going.  I drive by it all the time and it just kept calling my name.  FInally one night we decided to try it out.  SO glad we did.  I have been 5 times in less than 2 months!  If I could afford it I'd go more often.  One amazing thing they have and that you automatically get is their bread.  It tastes sooooo good and it is hard only eat one, I always get full on them.  Then I get their salad.  They have the BEST italian dressing!!!  Next I get the wings hot.  They are so scrumptious!  Then I have had the spaghetti, alfredo, pizza, and penne.  All of the above were so good.  I always want to go to Red Devil and my boyfriend has to remind me to mix it up.  But if I could I would go once a week.  It is a place that I feel like I am at home.  It is because of the food, the wait staff, the friendliness and the food!

Went to Joe's last night.  Not my first time at all, but my first time seeing the expansion and it looks AMAZING!!!!  I love it!  The place looks amazing, the employees are always so nice and are so helpful and friendly, and the bands (especially Money Shot) are awesome.    I HIGHLY recommend going to Joes.  It is a great place to make your usual hang out!

FIrst of the event coordinator Annie is AMAZING.  She is spunky, beautiful, and so nice.  She made me feel so welcome!  The patio at Tommy's is breath taking.  You feel like you are on an island.  The atmosphere is so calm and breezy.    The staff welcomed me as if I was a regular.  I had this amazing steak salad called Saba Steak Salad.  And I had the Island Goat Cheese.  I can barely explain them because I will talk myself into going back there.  The steak in the salad melted in my mouth and was seasoned to perfection!  The dressing had a garlic aioli that added so much flare and flavor.  There were 3 potato coins on the side that were a great addition to the salad.   The spring mix and romaine was fresh and I was very pleased.  Now to the goat cheese.  HOLY COW.  So tasty!!  It wasn't overwhelming is was perfect.  There were tortillas strips on the side that were dangerous because I really wanted a bag of them when I was done.  There was also a mango salsa with the cheese and I will admit I had a spoonful of it on its own.  As you can tell I HIGHLY recommend Tommy Bahamas.  What would be great is everyone bought tickets to the Original Taste this weekend and you can taste 36 restaurants in one event!!!

YUM!!!!!  This was actually my 2nd time having their pizza, but the first time It was brought to me.  This time I went to DC Ranch Market Street to watch my friend's band Rock Lobster play.  We sat on the patio at Grimaldis so we could still watch the band.  Chandler, he was our server/bartender.  We had such good conversation with him.  He made us both feel like we were appreciated for being there and gave us the perfect amount of attention to make us feel special.  He was an amazing multi-tasker, he was able to hold up conversation with us, continuously pour drinks, enter orders in, give us amazing service, and get our food to us lightening fast even though they were slammed for the nights event.  This location is super far from my home, but because of Chandler, we would easily go back to this location when we want Grimaldis.  Now for the food... We got a small pepperoni, which is not small.  I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the pizza come out.  I was thinking personal pan pizza size for 9$.  NOPE it was the size of what I would think was a medium.  Grimaldis uses some of the most amazing and fresh tomato sauce that just explodes with flavor.  Their cheese tastes like it was made in their kitchen from scratch.  The little pepperonis are so think and full of intense flavor.  I savored the pizza with every bite.  I am a pizza lover and they get an A+ for sure.  I can't wait to go back and I recommend everyone check it out... really soon!

I used to t at te location in downtown Portland when I live in Oregon. It was an obsession. They have such good geek salad and lemon soup. They don't have the best quality pits and the gyro meat can be a tad dry, but when it cones to getting a Greek fix and leave happy, this is a great place to go. When it comes to quality, Athenas is AMAZING

Was it worth the 21$ for a salad and small pizza? Absolutely not! Bad service. Maybe the guys grandma died I don't know. I want to tell you what really made me mad about the experience. We order the small pizza and salad and the guys could have cared less and took our $ and we sat down. We were looking around and hmm, there's a sign saying "x large pizza and large salad only 23$". Wow that would have been nice if the guy told us that. I left hungry, mad and unsatisfied.   To the owner: teach your employees the value of upselling and telling the specials. Something so small can affect a customers experience negatively.   And your salads are severely overpriced   Won't go back unless I'm desperate.

I chose this place as one of my 2 weekend restaurants to go to.  And I am so glad I did!  I have been waiting to find an amazing Thai restaurant and I found it!  So the place is beautiful and clean.  While inside you would never know you were in a strip mall.  We ordered the Chicken Pad Thai Hot and the Sweet and Sour Pork.  It came out in less than 10 minutes!  We were so surprised!  And the waitress was so nice.  I am very picky about my pad thai and the flavor combination.  This one was right on!  It was perfectly sweet but so spicy with the slight egg flavor.  It made my eyes roll back as my taste buds were in heaven.  I am glad to say this is my Thai spot.  The sweet and sour was mouth watering.  The tricky thing about sweet and sour is the sauce can taste face or pre-bought.  Not at TOT!  It was so good and fresh and it was a great choice.  I HIGHLY recommend and I can't wait to go back and try the curry.

Terrible!  I ordered a HUGE order an they forgot two things. That's ok i guess but when I called to inform them that my food is missing, the manager  Cheri argued with me as if I was lying!  She kept telling me she knows its in the bag and i need to checkthe bag  i was appauled  ive been the gm of prestigious restaurants an i grew up running my dads sandwich shops (he owns 12 so i would say i know what im talking about!)The right thing to do is to live by "the customers always right" in that industry. The best part is, I found out that it was her fault. Yes, she put it in A bag. But she never gave that bag to the driver. She should have comped the sale because our food was ordered as an office to eat together and guess who ate alone?! ME!!  I see why they are closing locations in other cities!!!!  I do want to say thatthe driver was AMAZING!!!!  Thanks to him I am happier.  I bumped it up a star only because someone named Allison called and she apologized for the mess up. Thata nice and all, but mess ups happen thy is not a problem. Happens everyday inthe food industry. The one star and bad review was given because of the manager Cheri arguing with me as if I was making up the fact that my lunch was notbi n the bag. No one called to apologize for one her arguing rather than apologizing and getting my lunch to me asap and to apologizing because she was wrong about it being in the bag because she left it on the delivery shelf!  So Allison, thanks for trying.

So you walk into this restaurant and fear will wash over your face.  It is slightly unnerving to see no wall decorations and what they do have does not match.  I was wondering if we made the right decision.  Once the food came out, I KNEW we made the best decision.  FIrst off the portions are enormous and second the food taste amazing.  Fresh quality and perfect flavor combination.  Don't let looks be deceiving and give this place a try if you are craving some delicious chinese food

I'm giving a 4 star because I hvent had what I would call a full experience. I went for happy hour with my co-workers. I love the wine selection and the wait staff is well educated on the wine as well. I has a Souvenig Blanc called Selene that wa amazing and is now my new favorite wine. Suggest giving this wine a taste. They had a yummy goat cheese and red pepper flat bread. It felt light enough to eat a whole one by myself but it was big enough to share. Definitely a great place to relax out on the patio and enjoy yourself and some good wine and treats.

Yummy yummy yummy.  I really enjoyed my experience at Sala!  The ingredients were high quality and the portions are huge.  The service isn't wonderful so go for the experience of amazing food not for the experience of the whole package.  I got the Chicken Pad Thai, the Pa Nang Curry and brown rice.  Some of the best I have had.  I highly recommend going to Sala if you want great thai food and a beautiful atmosphere.

I have had just about everything on the menu. And it has all been so tasty!  I am never let down. The wait staff is always super nice, helpful and educated onthe menu. I would highly recommend eating there. And try it all. You won't be let down. And always check out their specials. They always have them and they are always awesome!!  The owners are great guys and really care about their restaurants and that shows vigorously throughout the food and the people.

I really enjoyed my hike here!  When we drove up I saw how many trails there were so we really had our work cut out for us.  One of my favorite things when hiking is when there is a lot of looks rocks, it is a great workout.  This mountain had that, is was perfectly steep, and just invigorating.  The scenery is breath taking and makes you really appreciate life.  Hike here for sure.  I am going again.

Love me sme Greek! And pita jungle takes care of you. Their Greek salad is huge and it has the perfect amour of dressing an their pitas are warm and tasty. Tge wait staff is young and they have good rapport. It is nice to see them in street clothes, it makes it so it isn't stuffy. Pita Jungle is a great place for lich or dinner and e prepared because they get really busy!

I invented that awesome Brizza with the gravy and potato!  I love Scramble and their food is top notch.  I used to be a manager here and I can tell you that they use amazingly fresh food and they truly care about freshness and quality.  The food will be consistent and tasty every visit you have.

This is my first review here but I willgo back to try a sandwich. I went in for lunch and met a couple people. I only got a soup and salad because the staff was rushing me to decide. There were way too many choices with way too much pressure. I was really looking forward to a good sandwich too :(. The soup an salad was ok but not satisfying. My boyfriend has the pulled pork and he was unsatisfied. He said and I agree that it was pure sauce and you could never tell what meat it was because of the sauce overload and because of the look of the meat. scary!!!

Everyone who knows me, knows I love Italian food. Babbo was really good. Definitely not the best I've ever had, but when you have great service, great food and a great ambiance then it is a winner. I felt so comfortable at this restaurant. I felt like I was a regular my first time.   I had the spicy penne and Adam got the alfredo. Both were very good. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was savory. I had a bloody mary that I will say just slipped by my picky bloody mary radar.   I would easily go back to eat here. I would eat here often if the was one in North Phoenix.

This will be my first review for this place.  I didn't get to go to the actual restaurant.  I found it insanely weird that a restaurant wasn't open on the weekends.  I am assuming that the area over in Deer Valley just doesn't get busy on the weekends?  So we arrived at their restaurant and they had a sign on the door saying they are closed and will be at a farmers market.  So I found out which market and had to drive 20 minutes south.  The booth didn't have a sign on it big enough to see it and we walked by it and had to walk around again.  I am pretty sure we looked like lost tourists!  Sad.  We ordered the one thing they had, a pork sandwich.. it was SOOOOOO good!  The pork melted in my mouth and the bbq sauce was perfectly spicy and complimented the sandwich so wonderfully!  My taste buds were thanking me.  It was amazing and it wasn't even hot (heat) and I ate it at a farmers market.  That says something!  So we will be making another trip to their actual restaurant soon so we can get a real experience.  I can't wait!

Looks like I have to make a trip!!!!  I suggest the blueberry yogurt and top it with all the fruit options. If you feel like being bad get the chocolate and top it with all the candy bar and chocolate options!!!!!!

I am very picky with my Greek lemon soup. For instance, Daphneys has a good soup but I can make the same at home by adding a few things to canned soup. Now Athena has some amazing lemonsoup!  I got it one day on my way home from work and I was so glad I did. It was fresh and had the perfect flavor. Their pitas will make you drool. I still ha e to try more on their menu so this was definitely a review on the soup :)

I'm a big fan. They are super nice there an definitely make you feel welcome!  I got the chicken fried rice and I will tell you, it was the best I've ever had hands down. So good and fresh. If I wasn't so full I would have gotten more. Their edamame was super big and fresh as well and I wasn't sure I could finish it. Of course I did. The whole office loved their food and we will definitely be ordering there again

Do not go here for small wares!! I walked in and being educated on these things I knew what I shoul pay for the few items I had. I asked the worker to price the items for me and she priced everything (that is used) the price you'd buy new and some items even more than that. She ultimately wanted 80$+ if I added it up and I should have been charged 40$ max. All the other used equipment place are not only cheaper but when you inform that they are high balling you they always ask you to offer something, nope she said "well" and went to her office. That's unfortunate for them because we could have been lifetime customers.
