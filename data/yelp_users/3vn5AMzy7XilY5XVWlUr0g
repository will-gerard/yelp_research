Ordered take out from here yesterday and they had our food ready in fifteen minutes. Didn't have to wait long to pick up and pay for my order. The employees are friendly.  Let's discuss the food! The food is amazing. The veggie rolls are cook and fried to crispy perfection. The yellow curry was so delectable. We ordered it in a medium and it was perfect. I only wish it was thicker, but it's still amazing regardless.  The spicy noodles are good. Not as amazing as the curry but still very authentic. The noodles weren't overlooked and everything was just right.   All in all, great for take out! Will have to eat inside next time!

Came here to get a cake for a birthday. We waited thirty minutes to get somebody to write "happy birthday" on it. The girl came back out and said the staff messed up our cake. And that they did a terrible job and it looked like a two year olds handwriting. She then looked in the freezer and there was no more of the cake we wanted. She said she was going to go and try to fix the bad writing. She was laughing about it the whole time and I didn't find that funny. If she couldn't get the writing on it in the first place, then don't mess up the entire cake and try to give me a cake that has fingerprints in it and messy writing.

Love love love this place. So many options so it's almost impossible to not please everybody. The pizza is wonderful here. Wood fired and you can just taste the greatness. I especially love coming here for Sunday brunch. I have never tasted anything as amazing as the Monte Cristo and the Lemon Ricotta pancakes. The pricing is very reasonable for the portion sizes and the quality. The waiters are all very delightful and very fast. The atmosphere is great itself as well. The restaurant is very clean and I don't think l have ever had an unpleasant experience.

I've never had a problem with Hyatt... Until this last stay... We always come here for "staycations" since we love the pools and staff and the luxury here... That being said I woke up this morning and reserved a spot in the "adult" section... The pool boy was more than rude... Had a problem we had a cooler of just WATER... It was just easier to have a small hand cooler than stuffing the water in my bag... And my sister came one to drop off a room key before she went back to her "kid" section and the rude pool boy said we had to leave.. Well, had I known this is how I would be treated, I would of taken my business to Princess... And next time I sure will. Since I know their pool servers don't have the attitude this one guy did. Smh. Appalled.

I had made reservations for Valentine's Day at 6:15 through OpenTable and when we arrived they were running about twenty five minutes behind. That's alright because it is a busy day for restaurants. So that is understandable. What really irritated me was that I requested a booth and it was confirmed via internet AND phone that there would be a booth available for us. But when it came down to sitting down, there was no booth. I asked and they said none were available...even when I pointed to one across from me. The hostess said they need them to seat more people. Ten minutes later, a couple is seated there. I don't know if you can understand my frustration but that made me livid. Our waitress hardly checked on us. Water was always empty. Her personality was the same as cardboard. Overall, food was great. Service and seating was terrible at this location. I definitely have had better experiences with this chain at other locations.

Ordered from here the first time today.. My coworker and I decided this was a good choice for lunch but man did I think wrong... The sub was good that I ordered..up until half way through I noticed a black hair poking out in between the salami and bread! What?!?! Well that obviously ruined my lunch.. I picked the potato salad as a side and that was another mistake... Potatoes weren't even cooked well and and there was no flavor. They were super warm too. My coworker didn't like his salad much. Bland in flavor. The only good thing is the delivery. But what's the point of the food is terrible?

So. I always come here for drinks and appetizers with family or friends. Came here tonight for a St. Patrick's day drink and some appetizers with my sisters and a friend. The bar tender was a noob for sure... Maybe his first time making a mixed beverage. Food was gross. I think the chef took a few pain pills before he came to work. So he obvi wasn't on his A Game. The calamari we had was basically this lavish plate that was HUGE. And there was two pieces of calamari on there. In other words, the plate could of used some more calamari. The BBQ wings... They were cold. Like the waiters soul that we had serving them. The mushrooms... They're called stuffed mushrooms. But they weren't really stuffed... Maybe stuffed with NOTHING. The artichoke and spinach dip... Well there obviously was no artichoke and JUST SPINACH. If I wanted to pull a POPEYE I would of just stayed home. Anyways... Hopefully they hire more help and find a better chef. My blind grandmother can do better then this. If I wanted to die of thirst I would of visited the Sahara desert and hung out there for a few weeks with no cantons. I would of rather eat a bowl of salt then pay for this garbage I tasted today. Happy St. PATRICKS DAY.

Tried to come here again since I thought I could watch the game with some close friends... Well the waitress didn't even smile.... I stopped thanking her for bringing things out since she wouldn't even acknowledge me. She seemed pretty angry about us not ordering drinks. There was a disgusting stench in the restaurant and it really made me lose my appetite. The guy at the host stand said we couldn't sit in the dining room... Everybody was cramped in the bar section and the smell was Terrible in this one section... Stay away. Manager is rude and doesn't even care about the lousy service.

Only reason this place gets a two is because I enjoy the quality of the food. The service.. Not so much. Let's see what each star I took off is for. 1 one taken off since the waitress just comes and drops the check in front of me and didn't even ask if we wanted dessert.... Like ok. Forget that I wanted that fried ice cream.:. Another one is taken off since the last time I was here my friend and I split the check... Waitress snatched it after we placed the tip and made us feel like a burden when we were sitting down to chat for a little longer.. Only to find that they charged an extra five bucks for the tip to the wrong card... Last time I checked, that's illegal. And a last star taken off because the seating arrangements are terrible. And the hostess as the front door was rude. Don't hire 15 year olds that barely know how to speak. Since I like the sushi, I guess I'll go to a new location. And they change light bulbs in the middle of dinner here. Nice.

If you want mad diarrhea even before you're done eating m, this is the place to go too. I came here with some friends and it was OVERLY priced. My salad tastes like it came from a bag. My boyfriend ordered an enchilada but he got a crepe pretty much. My other friend who has a gluten allergy had to get a burger with no bun since this place is not gluten-free friendly. AND THEY CHARGE YOU EXTRA FOR CHEESE?!? Even though there was no bun? My boyfriends sister got three bite sized tacos but they cost 13 bucks?!? What?!? Cornbread was cold... Soda is three bucks... I could of gone to circle k and gotten a thirst buster for 86 cents. Super disappointed. Don't go here unless you want to be broke and want to be sick the rest of the day.

Came here for my 21st birthday and it was great! A little bit small table for a big group but the waitress was a doll and the food was fantastic. Great atmosphere. Will definitely come back.

I am a semi frequent visitor of the P. F. Chang's franchise. However, I wasn't as pleased this time around. I came here last night with my friend, and the only two things (I took half a star off of each for). The first half was taken off because our waiter, even though he was nice and very accommodating, he thought it was appropriate to wipe his finger on his nose and sniffle as soon as we were greeted to our table. Assuming he sanitizes in the kitchen after, it's no big deal but killed the mood a little. The other half was taken off because when we walked in the hostess just stared at us like a deer in headlights for at least a minute. So I asked if we could just have a table for two in which she only replied "yea". Not even a hi or how are you. She didn't even let us know to follow whoever it was to our table. And another thing that sort of irked me was the waiter circling the portion on the check that says "tip"... And put a smile on it. I'm a great tipper but when you circle and expect it, it makes me not want to give you anything (but we still obviously gave a tip). We ordered the butternut squash potstickers and let me tell you.... These should be called pasta ravollis. They were disgusting! But after telling the waiter, it was taken off the tab which was nice. Otherwise, the atmosphere is very casual and very "romantic" I would say. Maybe a little overpriced for the quality of food. But the soup is great!

Man, if I could give these folks a ZERO I would. But, there isn't an option for that.... so a one will do. My pharmacist was throwing a surprise party for a coworker and I was sent to have the cake picked up... The cake was ordered a week in advance. I show up on Sunday and hand the girl at the counter by confirmation and there is no cake ready. This is the SECOND time this has happened. I know it was not the girl at the fronts' fault and she was really nice but I am not impressed with the fact I have something ordered and paid for, only to have it not ready when it was promised it would be. Especially if this has happened before. Maybe we should stop hiring kids at the bakery and actually get orders in the night before so this doesn't keep happening. I will NOT be coming back and it's a shame because Bundt cakes are our favorites. VERY UNIMPRESSED. DO NOT GO HERE.

I love this place. I would give this place a four. The pricing is great for the food you get. What I have noticed is that when you ask for spicy level 1-5 on some days it's really spicy and sometimes it's hardly spicy at all. So it is usually a hit or miss. Yesterday I ordered a spice level of 4 and it may as well have been a 1. The food was still good, just not as great as it would of been, if it was hotter. The staff is nice. It's usually always busy in the evening. Great for take out! I ordered again from here a few days ago and the food was exceptional. If you're ordering for multiple people I would recommend asking them to label the boxes since they don't do that already. Food ordered using take out is rather quick.

I was behind that crazy Tom person.... I saw them throw a pen at the Tech! I can NOT believe she had the guts to do such a thing to another human! I also know that Theranos and Walgreens are separate systems. So if there was an issue with the lab end, that's not a Walgreens problems. I love this location and Nydia has been helpful numerous time to me! She's called insurances and billed coupons for my prescriptions and it always brightens my day when she is there. I am a firm believer in the Golden Rule. Nydia was not mean at all (even though she really should have been the way this lady was talking) Only reason I am writing this review is because I heard "Tom" say she was a blogger... More like she Yelps. So I want wanted to make sure people know that Nydia was abused verbally by this lady. And she was impatient from the moment the pharmacist and technician came in to help her. She should of been escorted out of the facility.

So unfortunately, I'm not a "friend" of Nydia's. I just get my scripts there. I've never used Theranos before since I have not needed labs to be done. So no, I wasn't behind in line for check-in for labs, but I was there in the waiting room and watched the whole thing. I wouldn't even have paid attention to the counter until I saw the pen fly across the counter at the tech and heard the absurd comment about being worried of people stealing pens. There was not a single moment where this LADY didn't have an attitude or any non-rude comments.

I used to come here all the time only because my sisters and mother and I would come here to see Evelyn. If Evelyn wasn't at this location we would of stopped coming! The people are rude up front. I've gotten my eyebrows waxed by others before and these girls shouldn't be trusted with tweezers or scissors. When Evelyn left the staff wouldn't refund us for anything even though we were unhappy with our wax services. Nobody told us where Evelyn went and told us she left the company and can't say where she went... I go to a different EWC now and they are phenomenal! Avoid this location at all cost!

So I have come here a few times... Usually for lunch with friends and the food is not bad at all and the atmosphere is nice and casual. I have been here a few times at night for some drinks and it is always fun to have a DJ and hang out with friends. In all the years I have been living in Arizona, there has never been a cover charge.. Especially a 20 dollar charge for girls and 25 for boys. Uhhhhhh... What? I was seriously going there to get one drink to say cheers to Cinco de Mayo and I would of been gone in 15 minutes. No way am I paying that much when I can get in for free at clubs in Old Town. The "bouncer" was rude and I will never be coming here again. Not even for food. Save your money people!!

The waiters are wonderful! Usually it's busy so try to call ahead and see if a reservation is available. Usually there is bar seating open. The honey lemonade was perfect. Just the right amount of honey and right amount of lemon. The best thing on the menu is the bison burger. It was cooked perfect and the sauce is delicious! I couldn't be more impressed with this place which is why I constantly come back!

Love love love this place! Great sushi! And great service! Food is of excellent quality. Alien brain is a must to order! Baked scallop is also a great favorite. It's a casual place so no need to dress up. Very simple, but it's for sure a favorite.

I had such a good experience at this location last night that I couldn't NOT review and rave about how great the staff is! My friend I came here for dinner last night and as usual it was busy and had about a thirty minute wait for a table. We saw a couple leaving the bar so we sat there, and I do have to say Joey was exceptional! Very nice guy and very good at his job. Joe was back there helping as well and you can tell this team works amazing with one another. We ordered the caesar salad which is always amazing and can never go wrong and an order of wings. The wings were cold but we told Joey and within minutes somebody came out and was super upset we weren't satisfied so the girl brought out a fresh basket! And they were amazing as they normally are. Had a pizzoki of course. And after the pizookis here, I don't think I will ever enjoy another pizzoki from anywhere else. When we got the check the previous order of cold wings was taken off and a 20 percent curtesy was adjusted to it as well. These staff members and management have gone ABOVE and BEYOND and we couldn't have enjoyed our Friday night even more!

You know... I raved about this place weeks ago and came back today... And I just couldn't be unhappier. Service was slow and the bartenders walked by several times and didn't even ask how we're doing or if we needed anything... It took forever to get the check and even longer to get the box. We ordered some garlic cheese bread and it came out with the rest of the food we ordered instead of just an appetizer... We ordered a caesar salad and at first they sent the wrong one and we had no idea.. We wondered why it tasted so weird but then the staff (all three waiters) just stood there and stared at us eating it since it was the wrong one like we were criminals or something. My friend asked what was wrong and they said we had the wrong salad... As if it was our fault they brought it out to us. The wings we ordered were cold and hard which is why we even came back here again tonight. I will not be back at this location ever.

Came here for late night food.... Not super late but 9ish... We had a coupon for ten dollars off so I figured I'd come here with my friend. Ordered wings and they were great. Probably the best thing here. Meatballs were mediocre. Found cartilage in my meatball. Brownie sundae was sub-mediocre. You may as well have just bought a cosmic brownie from the grocery store and put a bunch of syrup on it. And then top it with ice cream that has had freezer burn for three days. The cinnamon pretzels were a waste of money. The order comes with three and we only ate one. I think the chef was angry and just decided to dump a whole spice bottle of cinnamon on the pretzel. Maybe he thought we were trying to do the cinnamon challenge. I think I might have inhaled some cinnamon when I took a bite of the pretzel and choked. All in all, only come here if you need to get drunk so you won't remember what this horrible food tastes like.

I love the staff here. Everybody is so pleasant and even though he line is always long here, I don't think I've ever had to wait more than 5 minutes for somebody to get me checked out and on my way. I love that you can try the new seasonal flavors before you buy. Very convenient too since you get your capsules right away. I do recommend purchasing sleeves when there is promos and buy in bulk to save some money.

Being a kid and taking small road trips to Chicago we would stop in and have hot dogs... I never knew there was a Portillos in Arizona until I passed by today... I was so disappointed. The food was terrible compared to the origami Chicago locations. Onion rings had basically no onions in them. It was fried breading. The hotdogs tasted as if they were reheated frozen beef franks. The chili wasn't very warm and there was way too much cheese on the hotdog. Was not impressed at all. And I have never felt so sick in my entire life after eating lunch. Not worth your money. And not worth the sickness.

The patio seating here was wonderful. Never been outside a patio where it is so clean. It just made me never want to go back inside. The food is great. I had the meatball soup and it was great! The sauce was cooked perfect and the meatballs were very hearty. Every soup is delicious. The staff was very sweet and I am impressed with how CLEAN they run this joint here! Keep up the good work!

So this place treats its guest like shit. Basically we waiting in line for an hour and a half in the heat and when we got up to the front the bouncer wouldn't let us in. Reasoning? Because it was bottle service only or if you had a table. NOBODY PUT A SIGN UP OR EVEN MENTIONED THAT WHILE WE WERE WAITING IN THE 110 DEGREE WEATHER. The bouncer said he could let us in for a price tho. WTF. I am not going to pay over 50 bucks to get into some club. And when a group of girls walk up to get in, they are in with no problem. That is completely sexist and unfair. The one time that we did get in though, the drinks were super small and they were super expensive. SO NOT WORTH IT. Save yourself the trouble and hit up Axis instead.

The food here is great... First time coming here. Very impressed with the pot stickers.. We even ordered a second plate. My friend ordered the curry and I ordered the spicy noodles. We both got a spice level of four and let me tell ya.. This place makes their food SPICY. So order accordingly. The food was fresh and came out quick. The spicy noodles could of used maybe a little more veggies.. The only reason we took off a star is because the service was crappy. And the tables were dirty (we had to move to three tables before we found a semi-decent clean one). The hostess was on her snapchat when she was ringing us up and having us pay. The cook seemed annoyed that we wanted a second order of pot stickers. Otherwise, it would of been a 5/5.

I wish I could give them a million stars! This place is sooooo cute! The food is amazing as well! I ordered a flight of pancakes and each one was great! I couldn't have had a better breakfast! Hash browns are delish but I was so full from the pancakes I couldn't finish them. Super casual and very affordable for great quality. Our server was a sweetheart! I will def be taking anybody I know here! Very nice set up outside too if it's a decent day to be out! The wait is a little long but it is absolutely worth it!
