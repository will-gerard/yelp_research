Huge selection of great tasting food, have tried pretty much every except the shrimp tacos and it is all great. All food is made fast and fresh by friendly people. If you haven't tried it and would like something better than Taco Bell then it is a must.

Good service, great food, good place for a date, not a good place to hang out with friends. Full bar, servers take time to make sure you are happy with what you are ordering and with what you get

Great food, long lines at lunch but short during dinner, not a very big selection but huge burritos that will fill you up

Worse place I have ever lived. The apartments are nice but if anything breaks it can take maintenance up to 10 months to fix it (even if it is something easy). The office staff has no idea what they are doing, they lose rent payments then charge a late fee even if you provide them with the receipt they gave you for your payment. They are friendly, nice and will do anything to get you to move in but once you sign the lease your stuck and they ignore you to try and help more people sign leases.

Very expensive, but also very romantic for those "special nights". Food is great, everything is fondue (if you couldn't guess by the name) Friendly staff, very attentive.

The Royal Red Robin burger is the best, it's a great burger WITH a fried egg on it, could it get any better? Fun, family style restuarant

Even though this is not authentic mexican food it is still really good food. Friendly service, good food, full bar, the only bad thing is if you go there during a rush you could be looking at a 30-40 minute wait

Could be the best sandwiches in Phoenix, big menu, build your sandwich how you like it, then watch it get toasted. Great place

Great Chicken Feta Pita among other dishes. Food is good, parking is bad. Plan on waiting if you go during a peak time since seating is minimal.

Probably the best kept movie theater I've been to in a long time. Place is clean, not too many annoying people in the theaters during the movies.

worst movie theater I have ever been to. I went ad saw the Dark Knight here and babies were crying during the movie, the person a couple seats away started throughing up on the floor in the movie theater. I don't understand how people can bring kids or babies to a PG-13 movie and expect them to sit still the whole time GET A BABY SITTER . . . . . thats what I do. And if you don't feel good or are too drunk, don't go to the movies. Come on

it's Starbucks, what do you think? Great coffee, but a little pricey Try the Venti Mocha Chip Frappuccino

One of the better places for Pho. I wasn't a fan of it at the beginning of the year but the rare brisket pho is good here and the employees are friendly

The house salad and any of the steaks are delicious. I prefer mine done medium-well and this is about the best steak place that I have been to.

Alright to hang out once in a while, music is alright only because they actually play a variety of different bands, staff is friendly, drinks are good, haven't tried the food yet, but who needs food when there's beer

Good burgers and well seasoned fries. The fresh made lemonade is refreshing. The inside dinning area is a little small but there is room on the patio for bigger groups.
