Another 5 star review. I brought in 2 of the same phones, both with a different problem. He swapped parts for me in about 20 minutes and I have a working phone again! Highly recommend!

I have two favorite things about Mixteca..oh make that three.  1) Breakfast burritos. I think their breakfast burritos are the best and I've tried a lot.  2) Salsa bar! 3) Drive through - because sometimes you don't feel like getting out of the car. :-)  I pretty much only get the breakfast burritos and chips & salsa. Everyone I've shared Mixteca with seems to like it too.

My favorite restaurant ever! My husband and I grew up by Luna and have been coming here forever (he has been coming since he was a little kid, me since about 16).    They have a great bar & happy hour. My favorite thing is the happy hour Mexican pizza (sub black beans for the meat). NFL Sundays and Sunday Fundays are also a favorite. They also have Wednesday Family Night and other specials. The staff (especially in the bar!) is fabulous and always make us feel welcome!

We ate at the Arrowhead Mall Johnny Rockets tonight. The service was terrible  and the food was cold. The waitress never came back and offered drink refills or a refill and the supposed unlimited fries.   I worked at Arrowhead Mall when it first opened and ate at the Johnny Rockets a lot. It was a favorite.  I swore it off 2 years ago the last time I had poor service. We made the mistake of trying it again. Terrible.

I've been coming to EWC for a few years. I appreciate the value of the annual package; it keeps by brows from getting bushy!   I used to have to make time to get to the mall to go to the threading cart. Parking was a pain, I never knew how long of a wait I'd have, my brow style wasn't consistent, and sometimes the brow artists would be talking to each other in another language the whole time.  With EWC I have convenient parking in the AJ's plaza (which is the hub of my world), value, and a fabulous esthetician, Bria! She's super sweet and does great work! They have great hours for convenient appointments and they call and remind me about them so I don't forget!!  Highly recommend!

I normally get my toes done closer to home but needed to get them done on my lunch hour today. I've been here twice before and wasn't a fan. I remembered it was $23 + tip and wasn't great quality. The place I normally go is $18 + tip and far better quality. But given my time crunch I decided to try again.  I won't be back. First, I've never seen a salon that has plastic bag liners for their pedicure stations. Second, the lady was constantly upselling. No, I don't want the $38 pedicure, I don't want a flower, thanks! She cut one of my big toenails way too short which can cause ingrown toenails. She did up sell me on the the callous removal, which I normally don't get. I'm not a fan of the cheese grater. It's uncomfortable. Most places give me soft feet without that. Then she had to show me what she sloughed off. Gross, thanks. There was two different music stations playing and lots of flies. I would not recommend.

We've purchased take and bake pizza from here twice. Both times we got a Lighter Garden Vegetable and another large (cheese & black olive, for the kid). I have to say the Lighter Garden Vegetable pizza is delicious!  It's on a nice thin crust, creamy sauce, sun dried tomatoes, spinach, artichokes, etc! It is so good. The other pizza we got was also thin crust, delicious as well.   The crust reminds me of Zpizza, which I love, but the one at Metrocenter closed. I love having pizza without all the grease!   To those that balk at the price - look for a special. I've used Groupon Now twice. Great deal.  Friendly staff, prompt service. I really like Pizza Fresh.

Seriously deceiving groupon.  The service was good. The food was good. The place was cool.  I liked everything about it.  What I don't like is the deceptive groupon:  "$32 for dinner for two (up to $59 total value)      Two craft cocktails     Two gourmet burgers or hot sandwiches with choice of Salut fries or greek salad"  We ordered two cocktails $9 and $10 a piece, we ordered 2 paninis, one with the "Salut" fries", $10 and $9 each. Plus an extra $1.50 for the unknown upgrade to Salut Fries (server didn't mention this or that the groupon would only cover the cheapest sandwich and cheapest drink option)  Being good grouponers we ordered extra: hummus nachos as a starter and an additional beer.  When it came time to pay we got $32.50 off our bill because of the groupon.  This is deceptive because wasn't my groupon for "$32 for dinner for two (up to $59 total value)      Two craft cocktails     Two gourmet burgers or hot sandwiches with choice of Salut fries or greek salad"  ??  *note that Salut fries are mentioned on the groupon!  I really liked the place. The hummus nachos were amazing and I'd like to go back. But this was just shady.  **also note the photo of their hummus nachos shows 6 triangles, we only received 5. At $9 it's delicious but I'd warn it wouldn't be a filling meal.
