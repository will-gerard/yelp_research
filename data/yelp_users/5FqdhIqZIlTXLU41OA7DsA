Everything about this restaurant is amazing! The decor and food is fantastic and the owner is fabulous - love her!   We sampled quite a few things and while I loved it all, my favorite was the beef salad. Can't wait to go back!

Don't EVER take your family to Gilbert Hospital on Power Rd. While they may be "nice", you won't like them much when you get your bill.  They are charging me close to $4000 for a child's chest X-ray, a common breathing treatment and 3 hours in a room while we waited for results that were available 5 minutes after the X-ray. Absolutely ludicrous! Grossly absurd.   To put it in perspective.... we were actually admitted into PCH  (a children's hospital with renowned Pediatricians).  After a battery of tests and observation the bill was $7000. Still crazy high, but far more justified when compared.  I am disgusted. Predatory practice - zero question.

Lori is amazing!  She managed to work out very difficult knots while ensuring my comfort. Very impressive. My husband also had a very good experience with another therapist at this establishment. I'm definitely buying a package. Looking forward to my next session!

French fries were very good, the rest was bland and boring. Took FOREVER to get our food.

Cute place - great vibe, but the coffee and espresso lack flavor and depth. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her dessert in a cup (iced vanilla mocha), but my Americano and my husband's coffee lacked flavor. Granted, were connoisseurs, so our expectation is greater than the average consumer, but it was disappointing nonetheless.

Rushed. Under staffed. Pedicure looks decent. Manicure not worth the money. Disappointed.

We have been attending MISSION for several years now - on, then off, then on again. We initially left MISSION thinking we would find a church home that would better suit us, but after several visits we realized no other church taught the word of God better or more profoundly than MISSION. We know now that God sent us on a mission to visit other churches, so we could with pure heart spread the word that MISSION is the place to be.   For us, MISSION has had a profound impact on our lives.  For me, I have become a better person, wife, mother, friend, and believer. For our children, they love MISSION and learn so much!! Just the other day my 5yr old was singing "My God is so big, so strong, and so mighty - there is nothing my God can't do". AWESOME!!! And then just yesterday he told his dad "I'm really smart" and his dad asked why and he said "because I learn a lot from church"! You know when your children are singing songs and crediting their intelligence to church that MISSION is preparing our children to be stewards of God. Love it!!   Pastor Mark has a gift - he will enlighten you, he will make you think, he will make you laugh - a lot, and he will teach you the word of God as it was intended... through the Bible. No fluff, no frills, just the word of God and how it applies to our lives today.

Best car wash I've had in a long time. Looks like they finally got some good folks on board.

While they tend to do a decent job most of the time, the management of the flow of the cars is terrible. I was here before 3 other cars and they were done before I was!  Efficiency is every bit as important as quality of work.

Good food and service. Nothing fancy - run of the mill breakfast joint. Prefer more character, but would eat there again if pressed for time.

This is my favorite restaurant! Excellent food. Awesome drinks. Fun environment. I've had many of the tacos and they're all good, but I highly recommend he Braised Beef and Carne Asada. And, they're Cucumber Orange Salad is AH-MA-ZING!

We love Wok Box! We eat here at least twice a week. It's close to our office and the food is always fresh, served hot and tastes great! I've tried several of the meals and I've liked all of them enough to order each again. We highly recommend checking them out!

Pastries are pretty good, but their iced coffee is terrible. Tastes more liked iced tea than iced coffee if I had to make a comparison, but I've had much better iced tea even. Hate to say it, I love local coffee shops, but I can't recommend their coffee. Hope their food is better!

Food was excellent. Start to finish. Pho is the best I've had in town. Plentiful, flavorful, fresh. The egg rolls were good, but the spring rolls were fantastic! Atmosphere is quiet and clean. The wait staff is courteous and prompt - not at all in your face. Highly recommend this restaurant. Looking forward to our next visit!
