Easy to navigate than many other airports out there! They could use more space for picking up and dropping off.

Sprouts is my number one go to store for all produce! The prices are always reasonable and the product is always in great shape. I gave it 4 instead of 5 because sometimes when I go the check out is very slow (I think it may be more the customers though).

Always always friendly service, fast checkout, and staff around the store always ask if I am finding everything ok.

Awful service! We went when it was slower, sat and waited 15 minutes, with no waitress ever stopping by to even take our drink order! Finally we just left and as we were leaving, the hostess that seated us, told us goodbye, really??? On the floor we saw 4 waitresses, not including the bar waitress, wandering around, no excuse for one of them to not coming by to at least take our drink order. We will not be returning!

We had our school night there last night. It was packed, people seemed happy, and as always, their pizza was very good! Barro's is always generous to our school and I appreciate them very much.

The food was good, our griller was nice, but did seem a little inexperienced. Our waitress was nice, but took forever when it came to refilling our drinks, getting our bill, and had even forgot to give my husbands card back so he had to go back the next day to retrieve it! As if that wasn't bad enough she dropped a fork in sauce when reaching to pack up our food and she splattered sauce all over my husband.  With us we had our two kids as well, and they thought the food was great, but later when we got home, we all got soooo sick, my poor daughter even had to stay home from school the next day. Had to throw out all our $20 an average plate food, what a waste!  Then to top it off, the bathrooms! Both the men's and women's bathrooms were awful!!! I would have rather used a port-a-potty! I don't even want to go in to details they were that bad!!!  This was our second time there, the first was a decent experience, but this last experienced has left my family and I scarred!!! We are bummed because we love these types of grills, but we will not be returning to this specific one again.

This was not the first time we've been here, we usually have great service and the food is usually great too. However this last time we went we had to walk out! They sat us outside like we asked, then we ended up waiting at least 15 minutes just for our server to take our drink order, which she never did so that's when we walked out. She didn't come running to us until she saw us leaving, too late! There was no excuse for her ignoring us, 3 different groups of people came after us, sat in a different section outside, and their server was on it! Too bad we did not get that server :(  So we left and went down the street to Red Robin, much better service!
