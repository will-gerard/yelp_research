Joe's Grotto is my home away from home. I first came to this place when my boyfriend's band, Frequis, played here about a year ago, and I've been in love ever since. Mr. Grotto himself is a gentleman and a scholar. He is so damn friendly, always greeting us whenever we stop in. The place is a great venue for watching local acts. The sound system here is pretty good, and even though the club is small, it still feels roomy and home-like. Joe's also houses two pool tables, a few dart boards, and (my personal favorite) two pinball machines. The club is also equipped with an outdoor patio, which is surprisingly spacious for such a tiny area. Granted, I may be a bit biased, but for good reason, I promise. You can't do any wrong at Joe's. The drinks keep on flowing, the specials are cheap, and the music never ends. You'd be an idiot not to check this place out.  p.s. Don't forget to try the Trix Shot. You're welcome.

I've had their food in the past, never really stood out as great but it's the only Chinese food by my place of work. I order their Chicken Green Beans with Black bean sauce. Wasn't awful, but I've had better at other restaurants. Not only is the quality or quantity worth the price tag at all, but later that night and all throughout the next day I had food poisoning. My boyfriend had their Mongolian beef and suffered the same thing. Maybe it was a freak incident, maybe not. Either way, I won't be going here again. There's plenty of other Chinese food restaurants that deserve your appetite's attention. Hell, even Panda Express is better than this garbage. Don't waste your time. Or your money.

My favorite coffee shop in downtown Phoenix. The coffee is fresh, the staff is friendly, the shop is cozy, and their baked goods are delish! A must for every coffee connoisseur

Absolutely fantastic food. First time in, i had the country fried burger and it was soooo delicious. Also tried the lucky charm marshmallow shake, freaking amazing. I'll be coming here at least once a week, every week

Not impressed. I got the CB&CB burger, which sound promising, with thw sweet potato tots. Burger was cooked right but it was bland. My boyfriend got the standard char dog and, being from Chicago, he didnt find it to be very good either. They also char over a gas grill, not a charcoal like expected. This place is also a sport's bar, so it was very loud which makes sense. There were families eating here, so I assume it's kid friendly. The bathroom was a mess and smelled like sewage. I suppose there could be worse places, but I'll never be coming back here.
