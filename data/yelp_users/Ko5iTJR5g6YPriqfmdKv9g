Ok, I have to say that the tomato basil sandwich at this place is unbelievably charismatic and delicious......and I love me some sandwiches......this one is definately one of my favorites. From the first bite to the last I am in love with this sandwich.....slightly weird I know. The bread is fresh baked wood fired........um awesome. The tomatoes are fresh and I am pretty sure, locally grown.....so they are full of flavor and then there is the mozarella......oh sweet mother of god....sooooo good. My mom and I usually go about twice a week and split one and I look forward to it every time.

When thinking of My Florist the only thing that comes to mind is how underwhelming it all  is. Everything is subpar at best and the decor seems a little 1990's to me, its almost like being on the set of Friends. The thing is, its not awful.....nothing there is really bad so much as slightly disappointing.  They have aimed high but fallen short, I agree the food is heinously overpriced for what it is and the quality of the food is average. I had the Caprese salad and mozarella left me wanting and dreaming of the mozarella at Pane Bianco.....which is to die for. The service was adequate but I wasn't in the slightest bit dazzled in any way. I think they just really need to take everything up a notch.

I just had my third tatto done here and I must say I am beyond satisfied. I walked in randomly at noon on Monday with a friend of mine, told the guy what I wanted and he had it drawn up in less than 15 minutes and drawn well at that. Although, getting a tattoo isn't always the most pleasant of experiences, this one was a good one. The artist was professional and did and exceptional job and I couldn't be happier with my latest piece and I definately plan on going back for my next one.

I am a fan of Ikea for the most part and this review is less about the merchandise and more about the complete lack of service coupled with a massive amount of attitude. Tacky. I went with a good friend of mine to Ikea over Memorial Day weekend in hopes of getting a really great deal on a bed for her new apartment. A seemingly simple task one might think. Well, unbeknownst to us there was an elusive coupon needed at check out in order to purchase the bed/mattress combo. There was no signage posted and the sales associate upstairs (whose name escapes me) did not give us one. So, here we are, the store is closing and the sales girl, Randi,with an unbelievably abhorrent countenance, demands that we retrieve a coupon from upstairs and proceeds to laugh at my friend with a pompous smirk on her face. However, in the sales girl's supposed infinite knowledge and wisdom, she failed to realize that the store was closing, therefore THERE WAS NO ONE UPSTAIRS to give us this said coupon. Hoping there wasn't a storewide pandemic of awful dispositions, we looked to Randi's manager Todd for help. WRONG. The next gentleman (if you could call him that) was equally rude and condescending, claiming that "there are signs posted everywhere telling you that you need a coupon...and maybe I can help you if I get the time." We checked, and captain awful hair was, indeed, incorrect in his proclamation regarding the alleged "signs." At this point my friend is nearly in tears with frustration as we wanted to get out of there as much as they did. Then, captain early 90's pony tail looks and realizes his mistake. There is no flipping signage. He tried to apologize and be more accomodating by apathetically stating that "oh they must have changed the signs."  We bypass the ridiculous coupon catastrophy only to be met with a flood of more aggravation.  My friend would like to pay with both card and cash. Apparently this is a near impossible task for the elite group of people that make up the Ikea employee squad.  At this point the quote un quote manager asks if I can put part of the total on my card as the tills have already been closed. Are you kidding me? This is so exceedingly tacky that I just stare at the poor girl blankly. Open up a register. There was a silver lining, however. Linda, who was the only in there with a brain, was walking by with a cash tray and rung us up. So we managed to pay the total and get out. Meanwhile, I have lost 45 minutes of my life that I can never get back because I have squandered it on completely unhelpful human beings. I just hope not all Ikeas are staffed with incompetent sales people full of attitude and self entitlement. We were not asking them to solve world hunger or the aids epedemic, we were simply after a little bit of compassion and professionalism.

Let me begin with my friends car getting demolished by a drunk driver. We were headed east on McDowell in the left lane at around 6:45pm and some drunken idiot got into the turn lane and nearly hit us head on but then swerved and completely destroyed the driver's side of my friends cars.  So we pulled of on a side street and called t 911 and got out of the car to make sure that we were ok. Wellllllll.................half an hour later a cop finally decided to show up and.....shock of the century.....he turned out to be a complete and total jerk. He started asking us questions in an accusatory tone as if we were the ones who caused the accident. He was completely insensitive and didn't even ask if we were ok.  On top of being rude and callous.......he treated us as if we were total idiots, my guess is because we were young and female he assumed that we were stupid......or my other theory is that when he saw my friends Obama bumper sticker his bitter jealous heart began to ache for Mccain's abismal loss.

This store hits the nail on the head. It's a perfect blend of chic and eclectic. As an jewelry afficiando, I can honestly say their selecion is top notch. Frances is definately the place to go for unique and one of kind items. I could spend hours perusing there collection of merchandise and I always end up spending way more money that I should. On the up side I have never left there suffering from buyer's remorse.
