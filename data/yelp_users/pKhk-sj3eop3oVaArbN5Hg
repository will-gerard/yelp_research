Terrible service. Only had one bartender and no server. Had to order drinks two at a time just to keep my whistle wet. They really need a waitress to run the floor. It's clear that one person can't handle the entire bar on their own.

Great staff, AWESOME food! One of my favorite places hands down. The Green Chile Artichoke Dip is amazing. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who likes great food and atmosphere.
