Nice little establishment located close to the I-17 they offer selections you can't find in major chains. They have a large menu for healthy options if that's what you're looking for and the wait time for food was very minimal. Excellent food, friendly staff, couldn't be more satisfied.

This place is HUGE, one could get lost in here for hours. The assortment of items is amazing and prices are reasonable. They literally have everything you could think of and then some. Top notch!

This place is awesome! Their food is so delicious, they've definitely perfected the art of breakfast. Their eggs are so light and fluffy but I was more impressed that they make their own bread. We had their jalape√±o bread that comes with their omelette and it was AMAZING! The consistency was more of a cornbread but it is a must try. The atmosphere was very modern and trendy which was pretty surprising considering it's not located on the best side of town. All in all I was pleasantly surprised and I think I just found a new go to breakfast joint.

Timo's wine bar surpassed all expectations. Located right by my house I decided to check the restaurant out and boy was I glad I did. They offer a large assortment of wine with a unique and appetizing menu. I had their Mediterranean flat bread personal pizza which was absolutely amazing. The crust had just the right amount of crispness and the portion was filling. However I was more taken aback by the restaurant itself. We decided to sit outside on the patio which had a very trendy upscale feel. It had comfortable seating arrangements complete with string lights, a fire pit, and misters for those uncomfortable Arizona nights. I couldn't help but compare the restaurant to Postino's as it offers similar food and ambiance however Timo's definitely comes out on top. Postino's is often cramped with outrageous wait times and I have to say that the venue is a lot nicer here with better food. This place is an awesome restaurant to either bring a group of friends as they have good drink specials with large amounts of group seating or the perfect place to take a date as it's super classy with great food and lighting. Great job Timo's you've definitely impressed me and I will be sure to be back.

Food here is very tasty and the wait time was minimal. We had 5 people, all ordered different dishes, and ate it family style. Each dish was delicious and couldn't be more satisfied. The chow mein and sweet and sour chicken was amazing and I would definitely recommend. The service was mediocre, they weren't good but they weren't horrible either. All in all I will definitely be back

Chipotle on steroids... This place blows comparable burrito places out of the water. I saw a sign for a 1lb burrito and they weren't kidding. Fresh quality ingredients, super filling, and very tasty. Cannot recommend this place enough! Definitely found a new taco joint.

HORRIBLE SERVICE! I absolutely love Postino's so the fact that I have to leave this review truly upsets me. The venue itself was indeed gorgeous however our servers completely dropped the ball. We called and reserved a table for 15 people a day in advance to give them adequate time to accommodate. I would also like to disclaim that I work in the service industry so I'm not one to jump to conclusions, however over an hour just to receive our checks is NOT acceptable. Also we had multiple servers so it was extremely unclear who was "taking care" of our party. I've been to all the Postino locations and this was BY FAR the worst! Not worth wasting your time, if you have the option go to another location please do because they clearly don't know what they're doing here.
