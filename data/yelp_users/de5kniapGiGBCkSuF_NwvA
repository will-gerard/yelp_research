A good neighborhood spot, Uncle Sal's is tucked quietly away next to Staples and a UPS Store. Ha! Inside, you've got your basic Italian restaurant requirements; homey dec√≥r with green and white checkered tablecloths and tongue-in-cheek mafia paraphernalia.  Beware of Friday and Saturday nights - they can get quite busy with the local crowd. With a small party, you can sometimes bypass long wait times by sneaking into the bar, where it's open seating.  I've found the food to be quite delicious and the service is usually good, maybe a bit on the slower side when they're busy. And yes, many of the diners are snowbirds and "active adults," but that's part of the fun.  If you live in Scottsdale and want a good Italian meal that's as good as Maggiano's but close-to Olive Garden pricing, this is your spot.

Great experience from start to finish. PlumbSmart was fast, friendly and got the job done right.  We were about to install a new washing machine/dryer and discovered the valves were corroded and needed to be replaced.  I found PlumbSmart after a quick Craigslist search and gave them a call. Within an hour, their repairman, Charlie came out and did an excellent job explaining what he was doing and efficiently solved the problem. He was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Obviously no one wishes for plumbing issues, but I'd use them again if necessary!

I've been to this Meineke a few times without issue, but one bad experience has lost me as a customer.  I brought my car to this location for an oil change and was talked into getting a free tire rotation.  The next time I drove my car I started experiencing a thumping sound from the driver's side front wheel. I brought the car in the next day to ask what could be wrong. The employees took the car to the back and 20 minutes later brought the car out, saying they had looked it over and it was fine - that perhaps I had a rock in my tire tread that was causing the sound. I tried to explain that I believed the problem was more serious than that but they were adamant that there wasn't an issue and sent me on my way.  A week later, the noise was still there and the vibration appeared to be getting worse so I took my car to a PepBoys for a second opinion. Within five minutes they had lifted the car and discovered the lug nuts to be less than finger tight and the wheel was wobbling against the hub, damaging the wheel - unsafe for driving.  After replacing the wheel with a spare, I brought the car back to Meineke to explain that the wheel had been reattached incorrectly by his team and it was damaged. The employee was rude to me, accusing me of driving on the wheel too long and asking "What I wanted him to do about it?!". I said at the very least I expected Meineke to replace the damaged wheel. He eventually agreed, albiet visibly frustrated and unapologetic. I was never offered a rental car for the two days they needed to keep the car, or more importantly, a single apology for sending me away in a car unsafe for driving.  All that, and all I wanted was an oil change.

Delectable range of flavors that are as fun to dream about (I'm looking at you, 'Netflix & Chill') as they are delicious. I'm fearful of how dangerously close it is to my house and that I'll soon become Fatty Daddy's lesser-known cousin, Roly-Poly Kristy. ;)  Fun and friendly team-will be back!

Peach, cherry, and apple-filled donuts, along with their red velvet cake donuts are DIVINE. Also, fantastic service.  Several donut shops have gone out of business at this location-I think it has to do with poor visibility from the road and not having great signage. Hopefully The Local Donut can circumvent this.   Will be back for more!
