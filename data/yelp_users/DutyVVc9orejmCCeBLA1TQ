I've been going to this place for many years and it just keeps getting better. Walking around Kierland and once I saw it, I immediately started to crave their BLT + A - the bread is perfectly toasted, heaps of crispy bacon, and fresh avocado. The only change I would make is to have a handful of chips versus the handful of pickles.

Once seated on the charming patio, you know it's a good start when the server hands you a simple yet concise menu. We ordered the Market Street Short Rib Tacos and the Beef Short Rib Enchiladas + Manchego + Ancho - both tasted sublime and were a good, filling size. We both left satisfied with a desire to return.

UPDATE: Went to dinner here and was still impressed by the food. We ordered the Beef Short Rib Enchiladas + Manchego + Ancho and the White Bean Chicken Chili. The Enchiladas do not skimp on the meat or the flavour with the contrast of savory and the sweet of the Napa cabbage slaw. The White Bean Chicken Chili was a broth based chili with a slight unexpected kick to it and is just delightful with chunks of chicken, tortilla chips and a cilantro creme.

These days "gourmet donuts" are all the rage and often go wrong, but a classic donut and a classic donut like these could never go wrong.   We ordered a half dozen of donuts and were quite pleased (understatement). The Old Fashioned was light and fluffy and for my first old fashioned, sublime. The Cherry Donut, while a great flavour topping that tasted exactly like cherry was a little too dry for my taste; however, the other three enjoyed it and thought it to be a great cake donut. The German Knot was not too chocolatey and again, airy and fluffy and just delicious. The Maple Donut and the Glazed topped them all - they were fantastic and wow is all I can say.    We also ordered a couple Apple Fritters. The apple flavour was good, you could actually taste the apple in it. Also, the cinnamon was not overwhelming and the pastry was perfect to accompany the apple.  Truth is, it's "simply a better donut". Their slogan is very accurate.

After a day of shopping, the last thing I wanted was to eat in the food court or go to a chain restaurant so it was nice to stumble across this, a few minutes walk from Fashion Square on a one way street.   The service was friendly, the food came out quick and most importantly, a good portion of meat on my carne tacos. The meat was nicely cooked and the toppings fresh, which ultimately made for a tasty and quick lunch. The only downside? Not much shade eating out on a sunny Arizona day.

We met a friend here for lunch because she had heard heaps of good reviews and had been to the other location.   I ordered the Chicken Breast Combo with the Japanese BBQ Sauce and a side of watermelon. I was thankful my friend cut the super greasy fried chicken for me as it was strewn with veins, blood and bones; the most disturbing part was the bloody chicken. After two bites, I was set.  The sauce was less than used as it tasted very strongly of soy sauce.   Also purchased a half dozen box of assorted donuts to taste with my family. The Lemon Maple was dry. The Plum Yoghurt Granola's donut was nice and the frosting was tart but with a fermented taste. The Maple Bacon donut looked a lot less like bacon on top and more like coconut; we didn't even bite into it and as soon as it hit our mouths the hickory flavour was too overwhelming and caused 75% of the party to spit it out before even chewing it. The Glazed Donut was boring and dry. The Raspberry Hazelnut's centre lacked the hazelnut but sure did taste like a chocolate pudding cup. The Maple Ring did not have a strong maple flavour but the consistency of the donut was better than the others.   The consistency of the donuts were very dry and more like eating a bread roll and as for the taste, remained unwanted in our mouths for hours. While they were creative in their combinations, it's best to keep in mind that some combinations don't necessarily work well together.

With such great reviews, I was excited to try this place but left utterly dissatisfied.   We were seated on what seemed to be a slow day and had to wait a few minutes before we were even attended to with just water. When asked if we wanted something else to drink we said fresh squeezed orange juice, which they happened to be out of. Unsure of when the server would get back to our table and to avoid waiting any longer, we decided to order right then. We ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and the Huevos Rancheros THK Hash.   The Lemon Ricotta Pancakes came out smelling of lemon and sweetness. With that scent wafting towards our noses, we got really excited to eat. However, while it smelt so good the lemon flavour seemed more for show than for taste, as it was nonexistent whilst eating the pancakes. I love a good ricotta hotcake and this just tasted like a regular, below average pancake lacking serious flavour and very inconsistent - the first pancake was overcooked and dried whereas the second was chewy. Also, the maple syrup was not warmed it had been cooked because when you pulled it up it formed fine toffee strings, like spiderwebs which indicates it had been cooked.   The Huevos Rancheros THK Hash had the ever so slightest kick on some, not every, bite and was lacking in true Mexican flavour. The black beans seemed to be dried out and tasted of cardboard and there was an overabundance of red sauce poured over the meal.   Based on my experience, I would be reluctant to recommend.

I would recommend coming earlier to avoid the wait, thankfully we only had to wait 20 minutes before being seated inside.   We ordered the Pineapple Upside Down Pancake, Ham Benedict III as well as the Pancake Flight which included the Sweet Potato Pancake, Blueberry Pancake and the Coffee and Donut Pancake.   A perfectly poached egg with thick cut bacon (a substitute for ham) came out of the kitchen covered in a flavourful smoked cheddar hollandaise. The Benedict was extremely rich and I was thankful to have some hash brown to break it up between the bites - but the hash browns were not that great, less like a hash brown more like hash brown mash.   Now onto their light and fluffy pancakes...the speciality pancakes, the "sweet utopia", were hit and miss. The Sweet Potato was nothing to write home about; the Blueberry was just a normal pancake with blueberry topping; the Coffee and Donuts was left uneaten after a bite. However, the Pineapple Upside Down Pancake was unbelievably decadent. My first bite and my eyes went wide in delight - could not get enough.  In the end, I would come again if only for the Pineapple Upside Down Pancake. As one person in a review before me said, "If you don't Snooze, you lose."

Dragged my family to Shake Shack for what I thought was going to be a "life changing" burger experience and was left extremely disappointed...took one bite of the burger and would have rather spat it out than continue to eat. Not only did it taste terrible, but I thought I had mistakenly ordered a slider burger due to the smallness in size. The only redeeming quality were the fries, which were so tasty and the half decent black and white shake. Taking all said into consideration, it would be highly unlikely if I were to ever return.

Service was friendly and the ice cream was tasty. This place has the "cool" factor when it comes to ice cream because it comes with a show...the show being them making the ice cream with liquid nitrogen.   The only suggestion I have is allowing you to choose one topping before the additional charges. For example, a regular chocolate flavoured ice cream is the base price, but want a topping? Add .50 cents to that and keep adding for all the toppings you want, even a caramel topping is that extra amount and soon it starts adding up.
