If I could give them a 10 out of 5 I absolutely would! These people are AMAZING!!! I recently had my engagement ring made here. We had several diamonds from family pieces that we wanted to incorporate into the design. Our primary designer, Orly, read my personality and style immediately. She saw what we had to work with and came back in a couple minutes with the PERFECT idea. I couldn't believe she was able to put together exactly what I wanted and even MORE! She gave us a very reasonable estimate and the ring was completed within a few weeks as promised. When I came to pick it up I had so many tears of joy and was shaking...to the point where they even offered me a ride home. Kudos to Moda Fina! You guys are the classiest act in town! THANK YOU!!!

I feel so fortunate for finding Paperjoy. After looking at over 40 pages on Etsy.com for wedding invitations, I was about to give up (obviously a non-option). We scheduled our appointment with Lydia who is a gem. I brought in some ideas and she was a step ahead of us once she got a grasp of our vision. VERY adorable store! I am so excited to get our invites. And her price point was spot on for what we budgeted. We will definitely be using Paperjoy for all of our stationary needs going forward.

I scheduled a surgery for my dog to have some cysts removed. I was very worried as she is up there in age...to the point where I had to take work off. We arrived at the facility ahead of our appointment time. Nobody greated us or signed us in for over a half hour. Finally, once someone was at the desk, they said they have been trying to call me to reschedule as the vet in that day was a sub and not capable of performing the surgery. My phone was in my purse on silent as to be polite. I had called everyday that week prior basically to comfort my nerves and to find out what I should expect. Brittany is who I spoke with every time. She was nice but could provide no information. She said she would have the vet call me to answer my questions which never happened. I had no idea about cost. Will my pet be able to come home with me that day? Do you need bloodwork, etc? She said I would find all that out that day of the surgery. Unacceptable! Finally I get in with the vet. What a piece of work!!! She would not even touch my dog. Said her skin is disgusting and she smells. What vet in the world speaks about a pet as if it were an object? And to not even touch my dog??? Unreal!!! I will not be returning to ANY Banfield...EVER!!! Very sad considering I have been a customer for 10+ years. Guess your faculity is only good for vaccines. ABSOLUTELY nothing major. Oh and one last thing: the vet actually told me my dog would die on the table due to her heart murmur. I have since been to a REAL vet who confirmed this is not even true.

This place is AWESOME! I have been coming here for over a year now as several places in the past (and in the area) have really let me down. I know I am picky, but each time I come in I am more than satisfied.  The customer service is impeccable! They offer water or hot tea upon your arrival and you are ALWAYS greeted by someone. They have a great selection of colors to choose from, both regular and gel.  I use Amy for my acrylics. She is quick and her attention to detail is why I always request her. I used to have gel nails only and Christina always did a flawless job. I am not as picky with my pedicures and every technician I have had has been fabulous!   They are almost finished with a remodel and the place looks gorgeous...not that it didn't before. The colors are very soothing and spa-like. They have expanded a bit adding more pedicure chairs and have made the waxing rooms very private.  I will not go anywhere else in the Phoenix area. Prices are reasonable, they are open later, and over all...this place is my personal favorite!

It saddens me to give such a poor rating because I actually really like the food. It is the customer service, or I guess the lack thereof, that puts my review at one star. I always try to call to place my order which takes several times to get through...EVERY time. I figured out why. A lot of the front of the house staff are wearing ear buds. Back of the house fine; front is unacceptable. I have also been in a few times and my order has been wrong. Whether it is not the type of meat I requested or missing rolls from a dinner package...I don't like when my order is wrong or not ready.   I placed an order another time and was asked if I could be there in 15 minutes when it was 8PM and the door said the place closed at 10PM. This time order wrong AGAIN and they wouldn't fix it because they were "closing" due to pest control. I have worked in many restaurants and when they are doing pest control the whole kitchen gets wrapped in plastic and this clearly was not the case.   Finally, last night I placed my order from GrubHub as the restaurant has a stack of their business cards out to take, advertising $5 off your first online order. I go to the restaurant at the time the website said the order was to be ready. The girls behind the register gave me SO much attitude saying they didn't get my order. I told them I placed it 20 minutes ago and already paid online. One finally came back and said the prices online are out of date which I told her was not my problem. Don't advertise to order online then, in my opinion. They FINALLY got my order together and were at this point pretty much throwing things in the bag.   It is such a shame that these people have been given jobs at what was once a great establishment. My very first experiences were so very positive and the owner/s and staff were always so friendly and upsold in a enticing way. I am guessing there has been a change in ownership and definitely management. So sad...
