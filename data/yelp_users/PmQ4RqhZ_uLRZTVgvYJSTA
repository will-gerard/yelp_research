This is a review for the restaurant right off the lobby. Very nice. The best iced tea I've had in a long time, delicious quinoa salad. The guy had a very good mac and cheese and perfectly cooked steamed asparagus. I would recommend this place for lunch if you're in the area.

3.5 stars. Does not compare to it's equivalents in Chicago or NYC, but if you are craving decent deli in the desert, it does the trick. Had a toasted bagel and nova lox with cream cheese, red onion , tomato,greek olives.. side of very good cole slaw and, if you can believe this , a side of excellent potato pancakes served with sour cream and applesauce. My brother opted for a cup of split pea soup (it was so good and I don't even like split pea soup ..he gave me a taste) and 1/2 real turkey (not fabricated) sandwich. We shared an apple strudel for dessert and it was so so. They were handing out chocolate babka samples as we walked out and of course we tasted them. Best babka ever. There was no need to eat anything else for the rest of the day.....(ok, I had a few peanuts at the ball park later that evening.)

We were at a Diamondbacks game, and a friend recommended we try Durant's for dinner. Yes, we walked through the kitchen to get to the dining room. They bring you hot delicious bread to start, topped with onion, garlic, olive oil and parsley. It is difficult to stop eating this bread. Prime rib, medium rare,with garlic mashed potatoes on the side was very very yum. My bro ordered liver and onions. He gave me a taste....soooo delicious. I would go back to Durant's anytime I found myself in Phoenix.

BORING...It's one of those "very chic" shopping venues that is  sterile and dull with all the same shops you can see at any high end mall.  I'd rather walk around the TL in San Francisco. It's more interesting.

Great ballpark. Just gorgeous with plenty of parking (5 bucks), nice grassy area if you can't get seats (us)...Yum food and drink. Saw my beloved Giants play the Diamondbacks (we won ...YAY! GO GIANTS!!). Lot's of practice fields and state of the art hitting cages. Looks like they poured a ton of money into this place and it's only used a few weeks out of the year.

We stumbled upon Humble Pie on our way to another well known pizza venue up the street. This was the most delicious pizza since Osteria Coppa in San Mateo. Pick up a slice and it is not "floppy"...rather crispy on the bottom with a slightly chewy crust...perfect. Loved the pistachio and leek. The guy had pepperoni and mushroom. Great service and the pies came out quickly.Would go back for sure
