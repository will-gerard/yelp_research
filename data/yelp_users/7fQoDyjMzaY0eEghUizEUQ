I'm giving them two stars because their food was good. Other than that I will agree with everyone else, their service was horrible.  It was my first time there, but I had looked at their menu ahead of time and knew what I wanted. When I walked in I was the only person in the restaurant and yet the woman at the counter acted as if I was interfering with her work and like I was a waste of time. She was rude and took no time explaining anything to me. And when I didn't know what to do (because I was new and didn't know) she treated me like an idiot and did nothing to help me out. It definitely made me feel not welcome and uncomfortable.

My co-worker and I came here around noon for lunch even though the place was packed, they seated us within 10 minutes. The food is amazing, best I've had and the prices were very reasonable. This is definitely my new place to go for pho and vermicelli noodles!!! Oh and the spring rolls are cheap and delicious!!

They have a lot to offer with services and products. All of the employees I have dealt with are always very nice and patient with all my requests. I come here a lot for the job I work at. I've almost met every employee here and I can't say I've run into any negative Nancy's yet. The only thing I don't particularly care for is how highly priced everything is. If you want any normal day to day items I would go somewhere else.

I had the Grilled Ahi. It was delicious. I will come back just so I can have that dish again. Now for the service.... My waitress (she had red hair) was on the ditzy side. She did very well in the beginning, checking on us, willing to answer any questions. Once our entrees came, she was no where in sight. She would spend 10 min gossiping with other customers making her rounds. We never saw her. A few times we watched as she almost dropped dishes carrying them out to other customers, she did it twice. Although there was a tall white guy, kind of nerdy. He was the buser/host. He was amazing!! Always filled our drinks, took our empty dishes and glasses. He made up for our horrible waitress. He deserved our waitress's tip and then some. Other than that, I have no complaints.

We came around 11, it hadn't quite picked up yet. Even though, service still sucked. They sat us right away but that's about it. We had to ask for napkins and silverware. The burgers were cheap. You get what you pay for. My boyfriends burger was lazily put together and my chicken sandwich had sat out too long. The bread was extremely soggy so I took the top bread from one side and used it as the bottom of my other side. It had no flavor and I won't be coming back here.   When the lunch rush came in they took forever seating people. I witnessed a couple of people stand in line and then after a wait, decided to leave. I wish I had done the same. it would have saved me money and a stomach ache.

My favorite sushi roll I tried this go around was the Hawaiian Roll. It was delicious!! The other sushi rolls I tried were good as well.   Sadly that's the only positive thing I can say about this place. Everything else was horrible. No one came to our table after they seated us to get our drinks. Finally after 15 min we had to flag a nearby waitress down. After getting our drinks we asked for more plates and utensils. We were halfway through eating by the time we were given the things we asked for. The service here almost ruins the good food in my opinion.

I like to sit at the bar and watch the food that is being prepared. The chefs are always very friendly and if you catch them during a slow hour, they will even show and explain how the rolls are made. I like coming here because they have great customer service and a polite staff.  The sushi here is also very good. I love trying new rolls. I would have to say my two favorite spicy rolls would be the Sunburst Roll and the Poison Ivy Roll. The Sunburst has octopus on it with small slices of lemon. You would think that having the octopus slices would make this roll too chewy, but you would be wrong! Trust me, I was hesitant about the octopus at first but don't let it turn you away, you would be missing out!!The Poison Ivy roll has a cream cheese/ jalapeno spread that's baked on top, which in my opinion is why its so good!   I would definitely recommend this place for all those sushi enthusiasts!

This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants! I always get the honey seared chicken because it's just the right mixture of sweet and tangy goodness! I like to add on veggies for $0.99 more to get delicious crunchy snap peas, carrots and broccoli. A regular bowl costs about $8 with the veggies added on.  I also like their chili paste, it's kind of sweet and just the right amount of spicy. They make it there in the restaurant so it's always fresh and good. It goes very well in their lettuce wraps! (Which are also amazing.) I have tried both traditional and the Thai lettuce wraps, they are equally good but I always go more for the traditional.  The only thing I would have to say is I don't like their Sweet and Sour bowls. Something is off in the recipe so it doesn't taste like what it should in my opinion. Other than that the Pei Wei locations I've been to have always been clean with polite and courteous staff happy to answer any questions I have.

I love coming here. Everyone is super nice and courteous. My favorite lady is Mona. She is great at what she does and I always feel comfortable and confident when she's cutting my hair. I'm not worried she's going to chop off too much or give me the wrong hair cut. I live in Phoenix, but it's worth the drive over here for a decent hair cut.

Apparently the only way you can receive a package after you missed the FedEx guy is to bring them the paper they tape to your door. I found the paper laying in the hallway of my apartment no where near my door. After, I thought I miss placed it but figured they could look me up in the system either by name or address. When I went to the store they told me without that paper or a tracking number I wouldn't receive my package. Their system was being "updated" and they could no longer search by names or addresses. (I was never given a tracking number.) So for future reference hold onto that paper for dear life or pretty much face the fact you won't ever be able to get your package from them.

I absolutely love this place, best lunch spot! It is probably the closest thing i have found to good homemade Mexican food. My favorite would be their green and bean burro mix! It has delicious mild green chili and juicy tender meat inside.  It seems like a lot of reviewers don't like how runny the burritos can get. Which they can be but it doesn't take away from the deliciousness. Just save the extra juices for your rice or get a side of chips to scoop up that gooey goodness.

If you want a small town feel, then you came to the right place. Everyone here is extremely nice and makes you feel like you're a regular. This was my first time being here. The food came in decent proportions and of course tasted pretty darn good! Btw, if you come after 11am they give you free ice cream after your meal!! Ugh, you can't beat that. Our server was Penny. She was spunky, had a great personality and I wouldn't mind having her again.

My experience there was very pleasant and enjoyable. The woman who took care of me was exceptionally courteous to me and very attentive. She was nice enough to explain everything that she was doing and was able to answer all my questions. I will definitely be going back whenever i want to get waxed!
