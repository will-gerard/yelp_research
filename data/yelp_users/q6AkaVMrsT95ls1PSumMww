BEWARE! Not sure about the stationary half of the store but it's also a USPS. I have sent a phone and another gift through this location and both items arrived opened with nothing in them. I will never send another piece of mail through them even though their location is a block away! Don't send any mail through this location!!!

These guys are awesome! Our A/C went out during the night and we woke up at 5am to an 85 degree home. By 8 o'clock he was climbing on our roof and diagnosing our problem. He was very nice and explained everything that was going on with our unit. He also explained which parts needed to be replaced and show why and what they do. The prices he quoted were under what I could find other places charged as well as their labor costs. If we ever need someone for our air we will for sure call them right away and would recommend them to any and everyone.

Buying a car from this dealership was as painless as happy hour. Although we didn't have any cocktails the service was impeccable! From the GM meeting me in the parking lot when I arrived to Nick the Finance Manager who was able to get me a WAY better rate than even my local credit union. Justin the salesman was extremely helpful in answering all of our questions and working out a fair deal with the trade in and the new vehicle.    Everyone who worked in the facility was courteous and friendly. They even kept me company while my boyfriend signed the papers. This location made the car buying experience a pleasant one and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a Mini or any of their other used cars.

This place rocks! I live a block away and didn't know what this place was or that it even existed. After discovering a truly hidden gem and trying their food, I was elated. The restaurant is ran and owned by a family. The food tastes like it was made with love and pride. Its authentic from the basil seed drink to the decor of the establishment. Another aspect I loved is that its BYOB. So you can drink a bottle of wine from home without having to pay an arm and a leg for it while you eat. The food is so good and cheap. I've never had anything that i didn't love!

This quaint hidden bar/ cafe (not too sure what you would call it) is very welcoming. You order at the bar then you can decide to sit indoors or out. The inside is fitted with several retro cafe type tables. The outdoors is a garden of patio tables. The many trees and patio tables set an  intimate and romantic atmosphere to enjoy a glass or three of wine. (My boyfriend says they have the best Pims but who drinks that anyways). Perfect date place or for an after dinner cocktail to seal the deal ;) can't wait for winter to truly enjoy the patio and I still need to try the food it looks amazing.

Beautifully manicured course that takes you out of the city. Hard to find a course in better or even equivalent condition as this course in the middle of August. Its worth the money!
