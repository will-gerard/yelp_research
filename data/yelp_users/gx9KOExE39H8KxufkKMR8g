Got here at 8:30p, ordered at 9pm, still waiting for my food.  Staff is messing around, watching TV, chatting with friends, etc.   Stay clear of this place. I have never seen a TGI Friday's run so horribly!!!

This branch has a convenient drive-up business window, but it is rarely open. They then make all business customers wait in the same line as regular customers. Would definitely recommend Wells Fargo instead.  Wells Fargo has a dedicated business line that is always quick.  I don't have the power to change the bank that my company uses.

So apparently, the manager just informed me that they don't accept deposits 30 minutes before closing.  Never have I ever heard of this one before.  If that is the case, then maybe you should close at 3:30 on a Saturday instead of 4pm.  But then wait, does that mean you still won't take deposits 30 minutes before closing?  If so, then you should probably close at 3pm then...  That makes absolutely no sense at all?  I run a business and if I heard that my team was turning away people before closing, they would be fired!!!

I hate it when places have 3-4 people greeting you when you walk-in, but only 1-2 tellers helping you at the window.  Forget the greeter, pay someone to help me with my transaction faster.

I love San Tan Brewery!!! Their beer is great, their food is excellent and the staff is top notch!!! Their chef is always whipping up a lunchtime special that just rocks. And don't forget their seasonal beers too!!! I highly recommend them!!!

Yum yum!!!  That is the only way I can describe coming to this place.  My girlfriend and I have always enjoyed coming here, not only for the greatest flavors (red velvet is awesome!!!) but for their world class service as well.  We came here the other night and the machine happened to be out of my favorite flavor.  The associate let me know it would be about 5 minutes.  Of course, I could not wait, so I took this opportunity to try some new flavors instead.  After we sat down to begin eating our yummy desserts, she cam over with a small bowl of my favorite flavor told us both to enjoy it!!!  It's the little things that will always get you coming back to place forever. :)

I was extremely disappointed. When you call yourself a gourmet sandwich shop, it must be better than subway.  When I first walked in, there was no customers in the store at all. I was not greeted at all by the 4 workers that were working there. What was even worse was when I got up to the counter, I was met with the "stupid" stare like I should have just automatically started ordering and that I was a bother to her.  When you have a new business, a worker like that can have such a negative impact on your future.  Then there was the food. You get less meat than subway, less vegetables, in fact you don't get a choice I guess, and the bread tasted like it was a couple of days old and not fresh. I will not be returning.

I must say, this place rocks. Just moved into the area and this is now my favorite sandwich shop.  Fresh ingredients always make for a great sandwich. When it comes to restaurants, I'm huge on cleanliness and this place looks good. Can't forget their prices, those are great as well.

Great sushi here at this place. They will also make any kind of roll that you want, which leads to endless possibilities. It is not a very big restaurant, but it is actually just the right size. Good service and great food=must return.

Over 100 people waiting to get in and charging a cover. No bar is worth that. I'll go somewhere else that has cheaper drinks and no waiting on mill ave.

My wife and I came in between 630p-645p on Wednesday, 12/23/15.  The place was not busy at all, maybe about 10 total tables sat with a few people at the bar. We were data immediately and received our menus and told a server would be right with us. We were sat at a table right next to the bar.  10 minutes later, no one had shown up yet to greet us or take our drink order. We flagged down one of the 2 girls running the host/hostess table at the entrance and let her know that our server had not been by yet. She apologized and said she would send someone over. We then watched another table get sat 2 tables away, have a server come to them first, take their drink order, receive their drinks and not once did anyone come by our table.   We decided to get up and leave at this point. Best part is what happens next. As we begin to walk out, 2 guys who were cleaning the tables came to our table and cleaned up the menus and our build a burger orders that we have prepared within 30 seconds of us standing up and leaving the table. Also, as we are leaving the 2 girls at the front were just standing laughing, having a fun time on their phones giggling and laughing.  They both told good-bye and have a great night. My wife then responded back "No one ever came to take our order!"  We went down the street to ReHab Burger. Was greeted immediately and sat at a table. Server came within 1 minute and we had drinks on the table within 3 minutes.  If you actually want to drink "cold beer" and eat "cheeseburgers", I would go to ReHab instead.

Purchased a brand new sofa, loveseat and recliner. The sofa hasn't worked since day 1.  We have had 7 technicians come out over the last 7 months to fix it, but they keep ordering the wrong part. They won't take back the broken sofa and give us a new one.  Every time they come out, I have to take a day off from work to be home, since they won't accommodate my work schedule at all.   This kind of situation makes you feel helpless. You can't return it, they won't give you your money back. They won't exchange it for a working product.  They are not competent enough to fix it.  And nobody cares enough to understand what you are going through and try to help the situation.  Overall, I would never ever step foot into one of their stores again after this issue is done.  Stay far away!!!
