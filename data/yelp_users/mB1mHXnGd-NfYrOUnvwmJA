Wow. What an amazing collection of cacti! This definitely beats out the impressive, but incomparable collection at The Huntington Gardens in LA! Expensive admission, but well worth every penny.

Horrible experience here. At first I wasn't particularly fond of the idea of a commercialized  ghost town, but I kept an open mind. Boy was I right. This is literally a potpourri of creative and cheeky ways to get your money! Besides walking from one place to another and going to the bathroom, you have to pay to enjoy yourself- for everything! The bathroom in the restaurant was awful! so dirty. Please, avoid this place.

To start, I'm anticipating they went for a communal vibe, when designing this place, but it has gone horribly wrong. It is extremely over-crowded, it may have even be a fire hazard. The whole atmosphere was extremely rushed. The counter worker was okay, I wouldn't say friendly. My iced coffee was completely mediocre! The apple cornbread was amazing. Main con was that it was so over crowded, we had to wait for a place to sit, also parking was a chore!

This is a good starbucks. It's near the airport and has a not-so-rushed atmosphere. .55 cent refills on passion iced tea. Very clean restroom.

Absolute perfection. Phenomenal ice cream. Gregarious staff. Immaculate bathroom. Awesome board games. True communal feel. Cheap prices. Need I say more? No.

This place has some really, really great food. Here are the high points: 1. The guacamole was phenomenal. 2. The Agua fresca was amazing. 3. The lime tart was great. 4. AMAZING QUINOA SALAD. Low points: 1. I didn't like my milkshake- chocolate fudge with vanilla ice cream. 2. I didn't like the tortillas on my tacos. 3. The inside of the restaurant was extremely loud, so I suggest you grab a table outside.

An absolute triumph. I had the unique caprese bruschetta. The bruschetta was interestingly compiled with cubed mozz- a definite twist on the classical slab. For an entree, I had the pasta trio. Normally, gnocchi is dense and heavy, but this particular one in the trio was light and pillowy. The waitress was extremely friendly and accommodating. They even moved us to a table with an outlet!

Wow. What an incredible find. The gelato here is the best I have ever had. I had half Madagascar vanilla and half stracciatella. Incredibly nice gentleman working at the counter, very helpful too. My only criticism is that I'd really like to sample more than two flavors! Please try the candy in the jars. The one with eggnog in the center was amazing.

Here's why this place deserves a knock off of three stars: the blueberry scone was awful. Blatantly horrible; not sweet, almost savory like, which was odd. Had a weird granular texture as well. My espresso con panna was way more bitter than I expected, bitterer than starbucks'. These were the redeemers: the lemon olive oil cornmeal cake was absolutely excellent. The mocha was great too. The counter worker seemed very friendly and knowledgeable.

I was really blown away this establishment. I really enjoyed my crispy rice with fried tofu. The waiter was very sweet and accommodating. I enjoyed everything I had there thoroughly.

There were definitely a few problems that were found here. Upon entering our room, every time there was this weird smell. It was either a clean smell or just a genuinely bizarre scent. Then, the wifi did not work well at all, the connection was slow and kept on cutting in and out. On our last night of three here, there emerged a leak from the ceiling of the bathroom. Overall, we did get a great deal on this place, and it was in a convenient location, but these problems did dampen our stay (literally).
