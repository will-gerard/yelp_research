I sat in one of the worst chairs ever and waited for 20 minutes while no one payed attention, then got up to leave and the owner begged me to stay.  Won't be back

Waiter was overwhelmed and we had to wait about 15 minutes for drinks then never got water.  Orders were wrong. Extra charge on our bill for a game that was played on the little tablet that was never explained.

Horrible smell like sewer or dirty rags, we were hoping the food and more beers would help overcome the smell but it didn't.  After 45 minutes we had to ask about our Prime Rib Sliders and were told they "ran out".......but found enough for 3 of them...hmm...where?.....very gray meat which made us lose our appetites.  Callie came to the table and really did her best, but unfortunately we won't be back.  Between the smell and gray meat.  Very disappointing since it's soo close to home.  Again, Callie deserves a star for her efforts to try to get us to come back.  But the smell alone will keep us away.  The beer was cold!  This bar could do a great business if someone focused more on the smell and attention to detail.  Prime location for a perfect neighborhood bar which we were hoping to find.

Pam has a heart of gold.  Her intuitive nature allows her to focus on where your body needs some attention.  She combines her incredible gifts as an intuitive with her expertise as a highly skilled massage therapist to create an amazing experience during her signature "intuitive massage".   I recommend Pam to all of my friends and family and to anyone looking for a relaxing experience or something a little more profound with her intuitive massage.

Bob is amazing!  I met him at a networking event and when I walked up to him he had already pulled up my business prior to my introduction.  So it was no coincidence we were supposed to connect.  He was spot on with every bit of information that he provided.  I would Highly recommend Bob for anyone!
