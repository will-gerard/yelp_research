This place used to be a favorite lunch spot of mine when I was living nearby! It was always so tasty, colorful and fun! The service was always pretty good! My only complaint is that my belly was always quick fill to up with injera... that stuff is intense and soaks up everything. I think there's still some down in my stomach lingering from last year.

Lot's of really great beers on tap. Awesome atmosphere, staffed by really cool people and not overpriced. The food is extremely delicious, yet simple. There are a wide variety of pasty's for everyone's taste buds, including vegetarian minded people like me. I highly recommend this place for a drink, dinner or taking a date! It's definitely a good mix up to the usual fare, but be forewarned the pasty's are quite fattening--as is the case with nearly everything that tastes good!

Had stayed here several other times with no issue, but recently the property has completely gone down hill. Whatever you do, do not stay here. The place is old, dirty and in general disrepair, a magnet for homeless transients, people selling drugs, having hotel parties, etc. PLUS IT'S INFESTED WITH BED BUGS!!! STAY AWAY!!! Gross. Paid for two nights and left with in a little of checking out, refused a request to move to another room or any apology/explanation, did not receive any refund. Reported to county health services. This place should be shut down.
