If there was no stars I would put no stars. Customer service here is really poor. I'm sorry I don't like to talk shit, but really? I came in hoping to have some help to find out what fit my face. I never had Mac product before, on top of that I don't know a lot about make up. So I was hoping someone nice enough to help me out. No one ask if I needed help, so I approach a lady. I'm sorry lady but I think you need to do something with your attitude and face. If you don't like your job then go somewhere else and work. I ask her I wanted a liquid natural look. She said okay. Seem like I'm forcing her to work... She pulled out a brush from her pouch spray something on it then she smack the liquid on my face. Did it hurt? Yes ma'am it did. She was rough about it. Really? I felt like I did something wrong to her and she just hates me and hurted me... Dam. After she smacked on the liquid she just left me standing there. Okay so I went and look at myself see how the liquid work out for me... It was orange... Okay fine. She didn't bother to come ask me how did that work out she just went behind the counter and started chatting with the other workers... Okay so I'm guessing she's done helping me out? Who knows..so I left Mac with half my face orange. She didn't bother to ask me anything nor offer me a wipe to wipe clean my face. It was like I'm a ghost after she smack that liquid on my face. Didn't bother about her customers. And for the ladies that goes in there to get help. Don't let them use those brushes on your face, you don't know how many faces they use that brush on, and what kind of germs is in the brushes even though they spray something on it, right after I left the place the next day I break out like crazy... Funny thing is I break out on half my face and that would be the side where she smack that liquid on with the brush they use on everyone else. Get it together Mac workers.

Ken is great! I don't get anything done here, but my boyfriend does. Before ken worked somewhere else closer to my place, and just recently he moved to a different location. We didn't give up, we had to hunt the guy done for my boyfriends hair cut. He takes his sweet time on my guys hair and always 100% turn out great! So for the guys out there you should go to ken! He WILL LISTEN TO YOUR OPINION.

I was recommended to come here from my sister. First time trying this place out, and I love it. My dinner tonight was so good! Everything was good! I love it! Customer service is great here too, so if anyone craving for some Chinese fast food, this place is highly recommended! Out of 7 dishes I got I remembered 1 plate, and that is the Mongolian beef! It melts in your mouth and so much flavor!!! I love it!!!

First walk in is amazing. The place is big and spacey and great for large groups. Everyone who works here is very welcoming, I didn't feel rushed taking order, service here is great! It's my first time here today and I think I will be coming back with a bigger group, it's a great place for family :)

This is pretty much the only place I like to get my drinks from. All Starbucks are the same and drinks are too... But the difference is who's making my drink. Different people make drinks differently. Even though it's the same drink. I tried a few Starbucks places around my area, but non of the drinks I get taste anything like the drink I get here. I do not know her name yet, she a blond or red curly hair, I always call her my girl! Because she makes my drink the way I want it. I want it sweet , extra stuff In my drink she makes it! It's like we both have the same taste! Every time I walk in I see her and it makes me happy! My coffin is a big thing for me, and she knows exactly what I like. Overall I love this Starbucks I love the people in there, they are so nice, and this is the only Starbucks place I go to!

I have been here so many times and never had I ever had a bad experience here. I think I go here so much to the point where the owner there knows me! Personally I will choose tomo out of any other sushi/rolls if it comes down to me choosing. I trust their rolls, and every time it taste good. My all times favorite and also worth my money is the popcorn lobster rolls, they give you so much lobster on top of your rolls it's a must try if you want to try something new. If you craving some BBQ beef, try the Korean Bbq, they serve it in a plate that they fry it on, and they give you a lot of meat! With a side bowl of white rice. Another roll would be the dysert roll, it's a fry rolls that is stuff with cucumber, and salmon, sour cream, and crab meat. They also have happy hour that start from 3-6pm. If your on lunch break swing by and they give you a good deal on the rolls and salad. I would highly recommend this place to anyone that is planning on coming here, the atmosphere is chill, dim lights (great for a first date ;) ) the wait is decent, it's great! I will always be coming back.

I used to enjoy my dinner and customer service here,but for some reason this time around I feel like I was rushed to eat and get out... To be honest before writing this review it happen to me so many times not just once... This place is my go to for lunch or dinner. The food there is always good don't get me wrong I love it... But rushing me to eat and get out and pay... I don't like that at all... I would like to enjoy my food, not get kicked out... I took my brother and sister law come eat dinner here.. The waitress keep asking if we need the bill or boxes for the food.. Okay if I need the bill I will ask for it, if I need boxes I will ask... But they keep asking me until I guess they got frustrated they just brought the bill over and put on my table... Okay so your kicking me out... The hell service is that... My bill don't get me wrong is always 50++ and I don't care about it. If the owner is reading this please go over with the waitress... I love the place and food, but kicking me out is so wrong... What I hate most is I didn't ask for the bill and they just put on my table....

It is the first time I ever left a new restaurant very happy and not too full, but perfect for my stomach. The atmosphere was great and the server there was phenomenal. The wait for the food was a little long, but trust me, it's so worth the wait. I had the crab Landry and my guy had the shrimp creole. First time eating here and first time had a different kind of food and man. I gotta say this place its small but the food it good. That's all I have to say. Give this place a try, if you want to try something new :)

Scruff is awesome! The owner Debbie is amazing. She loves her work and it it shows! She's so dedicated to her work! Before I would take my dog Ted, to the one on dysert. And I noticed his behavior after leaving that that place he seem scared and he don't want anyone to touch him. But coming here to Debbie, my Ted is a happy dog going in and happy coming out! He seem to love Debbie! She does an awesome job for a good price! Make appointments with her because she's ALWAYS BOOKED! Everyone love their dog like a human, and she treat them all with care and love. The part I love also is, the grooming is not hidden! You get to go in to where they groom your dog and you get to see everything! It's not behind closed doors where who the heck knows what they do to your dog! But her it's open and you can see everything! This place and Debbie is a keeper for me!

This place disappoint me. I felt so hated ordering one drink here. I felt like the girls in there are forced to work. No one was happy, and they are snappy/rude!!! The place is a great place to hang out and chill but the atmosphere and workers there just make me want to leave. Very bad service here.

Atmosphere here is fun, the wait is a little long but thats okay, they are actually making your drink, and not pre-made. So I don't mind the wait at all. From my last experience at the old bomboba spot, I like this place better. Closer to my place, the worker here is welcoming, and they seem like they like their job! Which is good to see!  this place is the only place maybe around Tollison open till midnight! I love that! So late night munchies/craving, this place is the place to go to! I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for refreshing cold drinks :)

Today was my first time coming here and I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a place for some good boba! I was greeted by this cute lady I think she's the owner here, she was really sweet! I didn't wait for long for my drink to come out, and plus I didn't have to get out of my seat to get my drink! It was brought to me at my table! The service here was great! And the drink was awesome! Compared to another boba place I use to go to, I will now come here from now on! Worth my drive and money.

I been going to PT noodles for awhile now, and I have tried most of the Vietnamese main corse, from dry and soup base food. The reason I'm rating it 4 star it's cause out of all the dishes I tried I only like 1 of their dishes,  And that would be the fried rice with fried chicken. The soupy for ex; pho, bun bo hue, I think they put too much MSG, after word I would get a head high and drink a lot of water through out the whole day. Quality of soup base I think it just depends on what day you go on, tag along with that usually when you order any soup base food they would bring out a small plate of herbs/greens. What sadden me is I love alot of herbs in my soup but they give you so very little herbs/green onions, not enough for 2 people! The servers here are friendly and fast, and they don't check up on you a lot while your eating (which is a thumbs up because I don't like to be bothered while eating) All and all, this place is a decent place to go to around Avondale area if your craving for some Vietnamese food! I would recommended this place, over any other places around their area:)

Today is my first day going to this Vietnamese restaurant, and the waitress she was really cute and nice, but the thing that tick me off was usually when people order a plate that has rice they should give a free small broth on the side. This old guy which seem like his a boss there he said the broth is free with my rice, but when I paid and look at the price they charged me for the soup that they say it was "FREE". I compared my receipt to the price in the order book and it was different. So they did charge for my small bowl of broth. So whoever goes there please check your recipes and make sure they don't charge you extra money. I would've paid extra money if they would tell me the truth, but instead they lied to me saying its free and yet they charge me extra money.

Stop by for some curly fries (craving) after work, me and my boyfriend ended up throwing up all the fries that we had... It gave me a stomach ache and right after I threw up all the fries I felt better... Maybe the oil the fry it in was very old because I tasted it.... The fries was not crunchy it seem like it was already pre-made and handed to me cause it wasn't hot and the fries once again was not crunchy it was more like soggiesh... If I could rate it 0 then I would... Never will I return nor eat fries again...
