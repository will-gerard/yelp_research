Oh boy where to start with this place.  Me and a friend decided to look for a Thai place in Vegas after a weekend of camping/climbing at Red Rocks. This was the closest place to pop up on our way back to Arizona so we decided to stop by and give it a whirl.  This place is by FAR the best Thai food that I have had in America so far. But that might not really be saying much as the rest of the places have been in Arizona. But there is no place in AZ that serve Isaan food and mm mm mmmm I have missed me some Isaan food. Seeing as how both of us have not had Isaan food since we were last in Thailand, we decided to splurge a little and ended up with a $90 bill between the two of us. I'm going to just reiterate that every single dish we ordered was the best that we've had in the states.  We started out with some Moo Dad Deaw (Issan Style Pork Jerky) This was one of my favorite dishes in Thailand and I was just beyond ecstatic when I finally found in a restaurant here. Som Tum (papaya salad) with some sticky rice to dip it in was next. It was funny to us when the waitress came by and was like "Oh you eat just like Thai style!" Tip. Try it. Soaking up the Som Tum juice with the sticky rice is oh so delicious. Again I find it hard to find a place that serves a good Som Tum AND have the sticky rice available so I was extremely excited. We also ordered the Tom Yum Kai soup to start out with too and it absolutely hit the spot.   Then we finally reached our main courses. We decided on getting the Khao Soi and the Northern Larb. These are both Isaan (Northern region) style food that we have found impossible to find in Arizona. I'm not going to lie, the larb absolutely kicked my ass. But it usually does everywhere I have it. The dish was amazing yet I have forgotten how hot Isaan spicy really is. The Khao Soi is a noodle curry dish that is absolutely divine. I don't think that you really find this combination too much so I was glad to finally have it again.  I can't wait to come back already to get some of the other dishes that I have been searching to no avail for. People might go to Vegas for gambling but I am coming back for the Thai food. It might not save me any money but it will absolutely be worth it.  The only weird part of the experience might have been the fact that there was a empty table next to us the entire time. The place was hopping, the waiting parties at the bar were getting to be ridiculous, yet there was a table for four right next to us that was left empty. Now we had a couple theories for this. A. It might have been because we smelled. Everybody was in their Night out getups and here we were in shorts and a tshirt covered with a couple layers of dirt. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a certain odor permeating around us. B. We had spicy food. This entails me sweating like a pig. A + B probably meant nobody wanted to be within a 10 ft radius of me. I will try to clean up for next time...

Being the complete fatty that I am, I decided to stop by and pick up a box of Macarons to go on my way to meet up with friends for lunch. I figure since we had all never tried them before they would make a great dessert.  I got there at 2:15pm on a Saturday so pretty much closing time and all they had left was Hazelnut, Mint Chocolate, and Caramel. I got 2 of each of the large ones which came out to be $20 so they definitely aren't cheap desserts.  Before we tried them we had to argue over whether these are called Macarons or Macaroons. I still don't know who is right. But what I think we figured was macarons = macaroons but not all macaroons = macarons. By this point I didn't really care anymore and just wanted to try them. The Caramel was absolutely scrumptious! By far my favorite out of the three. The mint chocolate definitely tasted like real mints but I thought it was delish as well. Hazelnut wasn't my favorite but it wasn't because of any  real reason. I just liked caramel that much better.  I can't wait to come back to try all of the other flavors! or just a box of Caramel MacarOns.  The reason why I rated it 4 stars was just because of how hard it is to make it out to this place if you have a normal 8-5 job since it closes at 3pm and they are closed on Sundays on the weekends. I guess I'm going to have to use my "sick" time to be able to make it out here more!

This might be my favorite Ice Cream shop in Arizona. And it get so much better as it's local! SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL COMPANIES! THIS IS MERICUH!! Actually to be honest I'll support any shop that has ice cream in it.  Some information I guess since this is a review. -My favorite Ice Cream flavors by far are the Salted Butter Caramel and the Maple Pecan. But I've never had a bad flavor yet from them. And oh you better believe that I have tried them all. Possibly sampled every flavor every time I've went.  -I love that it is open til 10pm. Seriously, who hasn't had the late night cravings for ice cream?? and Wow Thanks to Yelp I now know that it is open til 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays. This place gets better and better! If they would now only be open 24 hours then my dream of having premium ice cream at 3am can now be fulfilled. -They have Almond brittle -They have Bacon Brittle -Let me repeat that. They have BACON Brittle. This is by far the best bacon brittle that I've had. Makes me want to buy a package and sprinkle it all over everything. IF bacon makes everything taste better, how about bacon brittle?!?  -Toffee Banofi. Just get it.  I rate this place 5 stars. Woohoo! As good as it gets!

Huge menu! If you're new to indian food be prepared to be confused. Waiter was helpful with recommendations. Chicken Tikka Masala was delicious as was the garlic naan. The Vindaloo was spicy! It comes at a 10 spice level. I took one bite and my head decided to go swimming. In my sweat. Good thing is they keep the place extremely chilly and serve water in these metal cups that keep the water ice cold. Service was also great. They kept that ice cold water refilled as I was trying to put the fire out in my mouth.

1. Oven chips with garlic and jalepenos. 2. Any of the soups 3. Any of the Pasties 4. BANOFEE PIE!!  BOOM. done.  PS. My favorite soup is the Mushroom, Walnut, Spinach; my favorite pasty is the Royale with Cheese with thousand island dressing. Yes it's pretty much a bacon cheeseburger with fries but the pasty crust just makes it oh so much better. I also give the $3 car bombs a thumbs up.

First time here and absolutely enjoyed it. There was a longish wait but we managed to snatch a table in the bar and had a couple of drinks while waiting. We then ended up getting a table on the patio which was kept nice and misty.  We ended up ordering the Funghi, Roasted Corn, Puttanesca, Yukon Gold, and the Spicy Barbecue Chicken and sharing them all. If you love mushrooms definitely try out the Funghi Pizza. It was delicious! I also enjoyed the Yukon Gold. The little pieces of Pancetta on top were just calling out to me!   For dessert we had the Turtle Budino, Sweet Corn Zeppole, Crespelle, Stone Fruit Crostada, and the special which was this almond cake dessert. The Turtle Budino (chocolate Pudding) was fantastic! We had a friend that could not stop licking the pudding out of the plate. The Sweet Corn Zeppole was definitely worth trying too with its butterscotch and Chili Mascarpone dips.  The service was fantastic and the food was amazing. Definitely coming back to try out the rest of the menu!

Love this place! If you have not tried this out yet definitely do so! Perfect for the hot AZ summers.  I have tried the Mango with Chile, Roasted Pecan, Strawberry Cream, Orange Cream, and the Watermelon with Mint. All were fantastic. My favorite flavor really is the one that I am eating at the moment. They are all that good.   BTW if you decide to sit down and eat your popsicles in the store, their water cooler is always filled with different fruit flavors! The last time I was there it was strawberry and orange flavored water. Genius!

When my rock climbing partner viciously kicked a bunch of pebbles and debris into my eye and blinded me out by the Pond @ Queen Creek, I went to work flushing it out with water for what seemed to be an hour. Even after all that, it felt like there was something still in my eye so I called and explained my situation and Jordan at the front desk gave me an appointment for the next day. But due to cancellations she called me back and told me there was an opening the same night so I grabbed at the opportunity.  Turns out it was only a small abrasion on my cornea but it felt like it was a lot worse! Also got my eye exam done since I hadn't gotten it checked in over 5 years :O  Dr. McMullen was extremely nice, friendly and helpful. All the equipment is newer technology (as far as I know... the last time I had a eye exam they were still clicking things left and right).   I would definitely recommend coming here for your eye care.

This used to be the amazing Angel Sweet which I absolutely loved. I have only been back one time since Gelato Spot took over and boy was that a mistake.   Like all the other reviewers..I don't know if you can even call this Gelato anymore which is weird as I have been to their Scottsdale location, and while not the best gelato, it is worlds apart from what they sell at the Chandler spot. The "gelato" was expensive, the scoop size was small, and the flavours were definitely lacking.  They had a peanut butter and rasberry flavour that I sampled that I almost spit out. Now for a guy whose nickname is Icecreamismylife, there are not many types/flavours of ice cream that I do not like. In fact I can only think of one time where I actually did spit out a sample. That was when Cold Stone thought it would be a great idea to introduce a Wasabi flavour. Well let me say that I actually believe that the Wasabi was better tasting than the pb&rasberry. But I guess you can't really take my word for it. I had another friend who thought it tasted like a pb&j. So you can give it a try. Just don't blame me if/when your gag reflex kicks in.  With all of the other amazing ice cream parlors in Phoenix I can't see myself returning again to even give it another chance.
