Looks like this place was actually a town market at one point.  Parking available on the street or a block down the road (covered parking on the left).  It's a pay at the counter type of place so grab a menu when you walk in.  While your waiting in line to order you will be given a number that will correspond to your table.  This is a genius way to prevent small parties from taking big tables!   We arrived for a late breakfast and were still able to get a table for 6.  You will then place your food and drink order (You would be doing yourself an injustice if your order excluded something from the Espresso Bar).  We ordered a breakfast quesadilla with chorizo and the American Standard with a side of biscuit an gravy.  For coffee we ordered a cortadito, 2 cappuccino's, and a Vietnamese coffee.  We found our seat right away and got ourselves some water which was in the middle of the dining area.  The coffee was served up promptly and we were surprised that the cortadito came in a pair of shot glasses.  Upon first sip, we knew we were in an amazing place.  The cortadito is pretty much the best coffee drink I've ever had in my mouth.  I would put it up against Monmouth coffee in London.  It was creamy but not too sweet and had a wonderfullly smooth roasted flavor.  You will want both shots for yourself (cortado) but it is a great way to share a coffee.  The cappuccino used Stumptown and it had a wonderful flavor to the espresso.  I added a touch of raw sugar to sweeten it and it really was excellent.  The Vietnamese coffee was a little too sweet but had a wonderful taste to it as well.  The E61BAR knows how to make espresso!!!  I don't think you can go wrong at the coffee bar.  The Cuban drinks use Mr Espresso French Roast (oak roasted beans from Oakland, CA) while the others use Stumptown (these are listed on the menu) beans from Portland, OR.    The breakfast quesadilla looks quite unappealing on the plate as it's a folded tortilla with a side of salsa and nothing more.  The filling was a delicious blend of chorizo, eggs, cheese, and onions (the salsa really made it pop).  I feel like the tortilla got in the way and a scrambled version would be a better implementation.  Maybe if the made fresh tortillas it would boost this dish.  The All American Breakfast had a huge pile of eggs, but they were uninteresting and rather bland.  The fried potatoes were much more flavorful with onions bell peppers and red pepper flakes.  Dave is amazing at making fried potatoes and quite a nice guy.  The biscuit was moist and fluffy...highly recommended!  The gravy was good but not as good as homemade.  It had a touch of spice but lacked a sausage flavor.  I'd be remiss not to mention the window enclosed kitchen on the way to the bathrooms where you can watch the food being prepared.  I watched Dave's potato magic and am ready to duplicate at home.  :)  The bathrooms are quite unique with each stall individually decorated with a different theme.  One of the themes are recipes but I cannot say they're used by the restaurant.  I cannot wait to come back again.  The passion in the food really comes out and the wood fired pizza oven is begging me for a dinner visit!

Second trip to Liberty Market on our spring training vacation.  Between the coffee and the food there's no reason to go elsewhere in the greater Phoenix area.  This trip we ordered the Chilaquiles, Green Chile Pork Scramble, Grilled Bread Pudding, and pancakes and a side of liberty potatoes.  Chilaquiles are SPICY!  Sooo delicious with the egg yolk leaking all over the chips.  This is probably my favorite of favorites.  There is simply excitement in every bite.  Green Chile Pork Scramble has carnitas mixed evenly with a mild green chili sauce.  Quite tasty!  The biscuit and potatoes boosts this dish's rating.  Grilled bread pudding is the best version of French toast I've ever tasted.  So moist in every bite.  It is literally grilled bread pudding.  Amazing  Pancakes were really moist an dense.  If you like pancakes, these are a good choice but boring in comparison to the other dishes.  My wife ordered a cortado, a cortadito, and a Vietnamese coffee less sweet.  She was in heaven as each of these were perfect.  So sad that Liberty Market exists only in Gilbert, AZ.  I'll be back!

Got the smothered burrito with chorizo, and the Sicilian scramble today.  Of course we got cortados and cortaditos again.  The carafe of OJ was tasty!  The burrito is a LOT to eat and I recommend splitting it.  The sauces really make this dish but the chorizo with potatoes inside is ridiculous.  This is second only to the chilaquiles for breakfast here.    The Sicilian scramble was light and tasty, but my party raved over it.  I likes it but there are so many other good dishes here with boldness.

Albanian family runs this location while the others are ran by the original family of owners.  The bagels here were drier than an east coast bagel and I would consider them average.  I did like the many types of cream cheese they offered.  I had a ham, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich (requested cheddar instead of standard American) and was surprised that they didn't heat up the bagel at all.  There wasn't much ham in it and it was a little in the dry side.  I added a little mayonnaise (they had to out some in a cup for me since they don't have packets at this location) and it was disgusting.   Stay away from the mayo here.   They didn't have any milk for the kids to drink even from the back.  This isn't a recommended stop but they were very nice people!  Try the other two locations.

Stuck in a strip mall in a rough area next to the airport, the barred windows make you ask yourself why you decided to venture here.  Opening the doors you'll find a L shaped dining area with waitresses that speak very little English.   I'm feeling better about this place already.    I'm seated instantly with chips and two salsas.  The chips taste fresh and salted perfectly.  The "salsa roja" has amazing flavor and the perfect amount of spice.  The "salsa verde" is a little bland but full of fresh vegetables.  I could drink the salsa roja.    The shrimp cocktail came with beautiful color.  The dish is filled with shrimp, cucumber, celery, tomatoes, and chunks of jalape√±o.  The first bite had an overwhelming taste if celery.  As I dug deeper into the dish the flavors began to balance, but I didn't get a strong enough taste of tomato/ketchup to claim this as good as I've ever had.  The shrimp cocktail is a very light dish that's worth getting again, but I wouldn't drive to find it.  Pitic offers authentic Mexican cuisine and is worth coming back to explore the menu.  Buena suerte!

This is the most charming coffee house I've ever seen.  Bergie's is located catty-corner from Liberty Market in downtown Gilbert.  You'll have to drive around the back to park but there is ample parking and a really short walk.  The coffee house is surrounded by white picket fencing and the grounds are filled with bird feeders and colorful decorations.  The coffee shack is very rustic with only a few seats.  Rainy days would make it tough on business here.  They have a wide variety of beans from all over the world roasted on the premises.  The espresso drinks are perfectly flavored allowing the coffee to be front and center without overwhelming sweetness.  Enjoying the coffee outdoors with the birds flying around and singing is as relaxing as you can ask for.  If you need coffee on the rush it would be a shame...bring a camera if you're a bird watcher.  This place is why Yelp! Is the best app you can buy...I wouldn't have come across Bergie's if I didn't have it.

Modern decored  restaurant in an obscure mini mall a few mikes from the strip.  Got there right at opening so was promptly seated.  The Oxtail Fries were amazing although slightly on the sweet side.  A little spicier than I anticipated so I was pleasantly surprised.  The Bahn-Mi burger was also tasty, but once again slightly sweet.  The pickled veggies really make that burger..I'd want it piled high next time.  Can't wait to try the Ronin on my next trip.  Worth the $20 taxi to get out here!

The Grove Coffee is a 7-day a week coffee house on The Grove Church grounds.   It offers ample parking and amazing ambiance with soft tunes and a comfy outdoor area.  The music is 99% Christian but if your not religious it's soft enough to not be a distraction to you.  There is a grass area with balls for the kids to throw and kick around whilst you relax and enjoy your coffee.  There were only a few pastries and fruit for purchase so don't expect to get breakfast here.  The barista was very nice when taking our order and allowed us to wait on the cool shaded patio.  The coffee:  they use Providence Roasters (Guatemalan today)  Caramel Macchiato - soy milk and caramel flavor dominated the coffee.  The caramel was tasty but I wanted a little less sweet.  Dirty Chai - chai flavor dominated this drink and there were four shots of espresso.  It is a good chai though.  Decaf Mocha - Unfortunately we ordered a white mocha because my mom can't have chocolate.  We added an extra shot and the mocha was strong, but didn't over sweeten the coffee.  I think less mocha would have been good here as well.  Vanilla Frappe - this was the best of all the drinks.  The vanilla is a light flavor leaving room for the coffee to blossom inside the glass.  Overall, just too much flavoring added to each drink with exception of the vanilla frappe.  I would highly recommend this place for a stop, but you need to micro-manage the sweetening process.  5 stars for the ambiance, 2 stars for the barista.  I can't rate the coffee because I couldn't taste it through the sweets.  I guess that's my bad.  Here's how the shots breakdown for each size; additional shots cost $0.75.  Small - 1 shot Medium - 2 shots Large - 4 shots

Upon recommendations from friends living in the Scottsdale area, we ventured here on our way to a spring training game.  Although we had a large party of 6 we got seated in only a few minutes.  (After walking out there was already lines of people outside so we got very lucky).  Walking to our table we noticed they have a true coffee bar with locally roasted beans so you can get your cappuccino fix.  There's also a fresh squeezed orange juice machine that pumps out amazing OJ...you finally get what you pay for in this liquid gold.  The restaurant was clean but felt like a run of the mill pancake house...I should have known otherwise by the passion in the OJ and coffee.  We ordered just about everything on the menu but the one thing that stuck out in my mind were the side of pancakes that came with my meal.  I don't even like pancakes...I'm a waffle guy but the pancakes with mascarpone are to die for!  The mascarpone they put between the pancakes offers a creaminess without too much sweetness.  While filing out of the restaurant we noticed SF Giants star outfielder Hunter Pence waiting in line for a table (I bet they didn't notice it was him  :) ).  He was super kind to take a picture with my mother-in-law but the point is that he was willing to wait in line to eat here...you should too.  I will ensure a trip up here each time I visit Phoenix.  This is one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten at breakfast in my life.
