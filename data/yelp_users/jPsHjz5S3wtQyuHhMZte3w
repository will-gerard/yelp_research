Definitely go to the one on Cactus ! I love the food here. We drove for 30 mins to get the best Mexican food ever! The Mohave location has no air conditioner, rude employees and will not give you a box to take your food home. I asked if I could pay for a box and then received one. They started cleaning before they closed. They turned off the soda machines and took the salsa. I went to the register to see if I could buy more salsa and they said they did not have anymore. Highly unlikely.  I was really disappointed. I will be back to Carolina"s  but never to this location.

Got sushi is the best sushi in the valley as far as I am concerned! This is mine and my husbands favorite date night location. Every roll they have is unbelievable. I have tried spicy yellowtail hand rolls all over the valley but  got sushi wins hands-down. The best roll they have is the CJ roll. The servers and the sushi chefs are warm and friendly. They take the time to get to know you.

I love this car wash. They have a lot of snacks and comfortable chairs to sit in. They have toys and games to keep the kids busy. Most importantly they always do a great job on my car and I am very particular.
