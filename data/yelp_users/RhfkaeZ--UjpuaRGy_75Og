Don't pay for an upgraded seat- you'll get less leg room than a lower fare seat. Warning if you fly this airline you are feeding into a monopolistic industry who will continue to lower the consumers experience.

Don't be fooled by the name, it's just not a great place to go for great steaks. All of their food is fabulous. so if you are  someone who appreciates food, wine and ambiance,  Modern provides the perfect mix.   Happy is hour is a great value and the bar area is busy with a great crowd as well as happy hour specials. It's worth overlooking that it's in a mall.

No one showed for my appointment. I sat  outside (with my dog waiting in the car)- gave up after 15 minutes. Frustrating being that I'm leaving tomorrow am for a spa vacation and don't have time to make alternate plans. Beyond annoyed.

Extremely happy with my gel manicure. The ambience was very nice and not your typical nail chop shop. My gal was very knowledgeable with nailcare and extremely meticulous. I'll definitely be back! Gel mani only $25
