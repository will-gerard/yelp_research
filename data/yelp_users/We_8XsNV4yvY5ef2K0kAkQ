This place is hidden and not the best decor, but the food is pretty good. The portions are big, which is good since we have a big family.  I like that they serve white rice with all the meals and you can always get more. It's definitely not the best place that I have been. But the food was good and the service was good. Very attentive and they make sure you have everything you need. I will go back to eat there again.

Had to get my tire repaired,  unfortunately it was not able to be repaired. The tires I have are not made anymore even though they are only 1 year old. They said they would look for my tire at another Discount Tire. They found it and had it delivered to this location. It came the next day. I made an appointment to have the tire changed. I was very late for my appointment and apologized.  When I got there Josh was waiting for me they took my truck back immediately and I was done in literally 10 min. I was so grateful and amazed they took care of me so quickly.  I always have gone to this discount tire.  And will continue to go there. They are wonderful!

We were looking for a different Thai place and came across this restaurant. We were at work and decided to order for delivery.  When I called to place the order,  I believe it was a cell phone because it went straight to a voice mail.  I called again and a man answered he sounded rushed and kind of annoyed that I was asking for delivery.  He took my order and said it will be there shortly.  50 minutes later I call him to ask if the food is on the way. He asked me what did you order again? So I tell him, he says oh yes my driver on his way 3 minutes ok thank you bye. He hangs up. Another 10 minutes go by and I almost called and canceled then the delivery girl walked in. 1 hour for our food and it wasn't even good. It lacked flavor, the spice was there but it was missing something. The papaya salad tasted horrible it was dry and maybe left out too long. The Larb was huge chunks of chicken an it should be minced chopped finely. Definitely one of the worst Thai places I have eaten. Will never eat here again.

I really like this bar. They are kind of hidden, you could pass it up if not looking. Great bartenders!  The menu is mexican food. I love the Carne Asada Nachos. Its a neighborhood bar lots of regulars but they are very welcoming.  I will be back to this place and recommend to all my friends.

This bar is kind of hidden, if you're not looking you will pass it! Went there by chance the name caught my attention and I had to check it out. I have to say its a great find. The food is good, my favorite is the Carne Asada Nachos! The tacos are really good too.  The drinks are inexpensive and the staff is very friendly.  Lots of regulars that go there but they are welcoming. I have since returned several times to this bar and always bring more friends when I come.

Came to Colorful Nails to follow my nail tech Danny.  I was impressed with the staff there. All very friendly and made sure I felt comfortable.  And of course my nails looked fabulous, Danny has been doing my nails for over 5 years and I will never go to anyone else. I would recommend this place to anyone.
