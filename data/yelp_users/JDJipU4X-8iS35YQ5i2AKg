Food always great!!  One of the BEST!  But the interior remodel is aweful. The fish tank is such a bad statement. Makes the place look cheap and looks more like other crappy Thai restaurants. Poor choice in a remodel. 86 the fish tank.

Walked in the other night and the place still smells like sewer. Heavy smell of restroom deodorizer but still a sewer smell. We had to leave immediately. It's been like this for at least 3-6 months and it's awful.

Well to say the least the place is dated 80's 90's look. It has a dirty feel to it. As for food... The chips they brought us tasted bland and were t my favorite. The spinach enchiladas was palatable but nothing to write him about. My partner had the Pollo fondido was dry inside and wasn't  fried long enough either as it was mushy.   We won't be back again as there are many other Mexican places that are much better.

By far my favorite Pizza ever.  Just had it again last night and it was great.  Called ahead and picked it up.  You guys rock pizza.  Can't wait to try the new location...that has a different menu.  I've taken many people to try your pizza and they all agree that it's the Best.

So tonight we had the wings.  Always good but tonight the wings were so small and dry and over cooked, we couldn't believe it. They were the smallest that we have had there in a long time. If the wings continue to be that small we're going to have to go elsewhere.  I bet if you were to weigh them they would be 33% less. Honestly they should be sold by the pound rather than 10 to an order. Nice way to make more money for Zipps. Talked to a women manager and she gave us some lame excuse about cooking time. And most of all she didn't care a shit about us. But most of all she was disrespectful of her customers.

OMG what a waste of a dinner the other night. Food was awful. The red enchilada sauce is disgusting tasting. The burritos are down right terrible.  We won't be back.

Chips and salsa?   The salsa is bland and has absolutely no favors. The chips are not one of my favorites as anyone else tonight. They have not other salsa. The street tacos, had a lot of goo flavor and the green salsa served with them is really good.  They out to serve green withe chips. Margaritas with chambor were good as usual. Beer was very cold as we like it. Oh and by way...to the ne owners.... Put the shrimp dumplings back on the menu.  Those were the best  appetizer on the menu.  I can only give you guys 2 stars. Still love the atmosphere here. Peace!

They repaired my broken glass in 30 minutes. Great service! I think over priced but you know Apple products.

We took a group of 7 last night. Food and service were excellent. Burritos and tacos were all very good.  Will be back again for sure.

Stopped when they opened at 4am but they had no donuts. Delivery of donuts was late. Really!  This should never happen. Won't stop here ever again.
