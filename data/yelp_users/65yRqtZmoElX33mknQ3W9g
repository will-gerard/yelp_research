Excellent food.  I bit on the pricey side but in all honestly you get what you pay for.  Loved e bagels and the matzo ball soups.  I'd recommend lunch over breakfast here but both are yummy.  My wife and I will be back

I really used to love this place.  My family and i used to come in all the time. The bagels were amazing but they must have changed their ingredients or something because they are awful now.  Nothing like the bagels and bialys i remember growing up as a kid in nyc.  The food is also abit on the pricey side.  It just wasn't worth it in my opinion.  I got a Reuben and it was luke warm and sort squatish.  I really hope they pull themselves up and reclaim their glory days but until that time I'll find some place else for my deli needs

Truly on of the best Jewish delis in the valley.  The bagels and bialys remind me of the ones I used to get as a boy growing up in NYC.  Its family run and the staff is veey friendly, efficient and helpful.  My wife and I had lunch (a Reuben and a fish platter and our kids ate breakfast egg on a bagel and a huge portion of kids french toast for the price we actually had to take some home) We loved it.  Very pleasant experience.  The owners son actually waited on us,  adding to the family atmosphere. He was very helpful explaining to my wife what bialys were.  Our food was out within 5min of us ordering us and he was very attentive.   Checking in on us every few minutes.  They even suggested they we come back on a Wednesday since you get a free 6 bagels with every dozen you buy.  One of the best breakfast experiences we have had in years. Highly recommend to people who like traditional jewish food...although its not completely kosher a large portion of the food is.  We'll be back and probably bring some of our gentile friends so they can learn what a REAL bagel is

No no no...all I have to say is no.  I may be picky but I won't be returning.  If bagel is in your name bagels are the thing you better do perfectly and although no one outside of NYC does it 100% right.  This is too far from it.  Sorry guys

Num num num.  I love my boba drinks and they get it right here.  I'm not much of a doughnut guy but they do about as good as Kristy Kream so hats off

The Starbucks of bagel places and I don't mean that in a good way.  It seems like there is one on every corner.  And I am a bit of a bagel snob.  It seemed like the dough was frozen and not baked properly.  Sorry guys you might be ok for your average gentile smuck but you can't pull the wool over my eyes

Horrible experience.  Me and my wife waited 20min for the bus boy to bring us a glass of water on our first visit.  We got our food about an hour after we ordered it abd it was mediocre at best, cold small portions and not the correct items but at this point we didnt feel like waiting another hour for a remake.  But the manager came over and gave us a $20 gift card.  So we though maybe it was an off day since it was saturday and we would try it again on a weekday when it wouldn't be so busy since we live close by.  And it was ab exact repeat.  But this time when we asked to speak with the manager they said he wasn't in today.  How can a restaurant have no management. We walked out before we even ordered.  Maybe we'll give the gift certificates to our kids cause we will not be returning.
