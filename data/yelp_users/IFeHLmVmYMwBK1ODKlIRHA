Doesn't get any better than this! I don't even consider myself a big bike person but I had so much fun at this store I will probably become a regular. They have the absolute BEST customer service. They stayed a few extra minutes to wait for me to grab my bike and bring it back to get a new basket installed and while they did it I spoke with Larry - the owner - who has rocked this shop for over 35 years!!!  This is EXACTLY the kind of businesses (and staffs) that enhances our communities in Phoenix. We are mighty lucky to have businesses like this!  Another note, Sun Cyclery has an awesome selection of bike accessories. Have fun decking out your ride!

I just love to go to Baker's Nursery. The people are so helpful and knowledgeable! They never mind taking their time to explain details of their plants. And, oh, the plants! Baker's has a wonderful selection of very high quality plants. I have purchased agaves, elephant food plants, seeds, tools and even a square foot garden from Baker's and all of my purchases have been great!

This can company is terrible! Bad customer service, bad drivers, long wait times on hold for dispatch. Don't waste your time.

This is the best restaurant, not just Vietnamese restaurant, but restaurant of any kind I've been to in a long time! I'm a bit of a restaurant snob from living in an area that is full of Valley treasures - Postino, the Vig, La Grande Orange, Chelsea's Kitchen, etc. we thoroughly enjoyed the pho, sticky rice with mango, and jasmine tea. The pho broth was delicious, the meat was very thinly sliced, too! The service was fast and the owner worked the room beautifully! People were at the tables leaning over and being friendly, telling us how much they love the place. The decor is so fun and artistic! Cute little cyclo riding skellies sit atop a mango red-orange wall and oil paintings adorn another. The owner was adorable with my boyfriend's three year old son - he was most welcome at Cyclo. We'll be back again and again!

Love this place! I've been eating here for more than 20 years and am never disappointed! The atmosphere is so posh but mellow. It has such an elegant vibe. The Oreo dessert is one of the best desserts in town. The fresh crispy Cole slaw is bright and creamy at once.

The ease of driving here and good parking are the only reasons I gave this one star. The sound quality at this venue is truly awful. When you go here to see one of your favorite bands and can barely tell what song they're playing, you know there's a problem.

Great service! Kind and helpful staff. Everyone seems to like working here. Wish your office was closer to me.

If you go, try the carne asada street tacos. Love that they have fountain drinks and 20 oz. Pepsi products. The owner is kind and helpful and the bus man is awesome. He's happy to give extra help if you always forget to get your side of sour cream before your food comes out! Who me?!? :)

Metta is my "home" yoga studio. It is truly a wonderful place to experience yoga. Real honest to goodness Hatha yoga. No hot yoga, no yogarobics, just a very good selection of healing, present, peaceful, strong, positive yoga. The entire staff of this studio is kind, comfortable, helpful and skilled.  I love to be here and enjoy the community that you automatically enter just by going to class here.  They also have a lovely selection of boutique items, in just the right amount.  I am so grateful for Metta!

John Hill at Space Massage Studio is so gifted. He truly knows how the body works and why it stops working or hurts. I went to John with some pretty bad neck pain and he relieved it quickly and without it having to hurt while he did it.  The studio is beautiful, easy to find and peaceful. John's manner is gentle and present. He is so unhurried and professional!  All in all, this was an amazing experience. I also consider myself a bit of a massage perfectionist because I have had many in my life (one year I went on a weekly basis) and also because as a yoga instructor I understand body therapies and movement to a fairly good degree.  John is truly a healer.

I really like Stingray, especially the Spicy Edamame, and the atmosphere. I've never had poor service, in fact it's usually very good. The happy hour menu has good choices, too. One star off for forcing people to use low sodium soy sauce - not cool!

I just took a three-night, four-day trip to a wedding and my pet sitting plans fell thru two days before. I called Marie based on the previous Yelp reviews. Marie is wonderful! She is passionate about pets, is totally professional and I whole-heatedly give her five stars!!!  Marie took a photo of my dog at each visit (they are some of my favorite pics of him now), she also filled out these adorable doggie report cards that talked about their adventures, his mood, his eating and pooping. :) my seven year old loved them and read them all to me while I did post trip laundry. The whole experience with Marie and Arizona Dog Sitting could not have been better! Please call Marie...you'll be "wagging your tail" happy you did!

I used Ryan for a long time until for no reason he stopped calling me back. To this day I have no idea how I could have offended him so badly.

Wow! Welcome to the neighborhood! The owner, Jarrett (sorry if I messed the spelling up) is a friendly guy. He came over and said hi. He nailed it with this place.  The guacamole is fresh and cold and the most wonderful texture and flavor...the chips are thin and crispy...the patio is so relaxing. I love this place!  After the guacamole, I had the Tostadas de Costilla. Which were delicious. The portion was adequate, but I wish I had one more little tostada. The short rib was perfectly sauced and the mix of unusual flavors was perfect.   I can't wait to try the Pastel de Abuela - their own description says: Granny's spicy chocolate cake with candied fresno chiles and pistachio ice cream - YUM! I haven't tried it yet because every time I go to this place I get full from eating all of the other goodies.   The decor is really, lovely, too. It is artistic and chic in a way that isn't cold or pretentious. It's just pretty and there are lots of lovely fixtures and pieces of art to look at.  As if this place couldn't get any better...It is mellow dog friendly, too!

Essence Bakery Cafe is THE REAL DEAL. I have no better way to describe this cafe which has been one of my favorite places, if not my #1 favorite, for over six years. The quality is consistently amazing. You can taste the passion the chef, Eugenia, has for the highest level of delicious, casual cuisine. She studied in Paris and is truly a local treasure.   Read this article for more: http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2013/11/eugenia-theodosopoulos-essence-bakery-cafe-new-location.php.  Of course, the macarons....oh my goodness. I don't like caramel but I can't even keep the delicious caramel cream macarons out of my face. I seriously counted the days until they opened the Phoenix location and I haven't been disappointed. I've been the new location about seven times and have had good service every time.   The coffee is very dark, which I love. The decaf iced tea is delicious. The Local Power Ranch hamburger with arugula, balsamic mayonnaise and Dubliner Cheddar is very good. Get it with the greens if you want to taste the most delectable spinach and frisee salad simply dressed with a vinaigrette.   I don't even know where they get produce of the quality they do - the thick slice of tomato on the burger was so perfect - like the ones we used to eat 30 years ago that I thought were bred out of existence.  Every time someone comes into town to visit we take them here and they love it.  Even the decor is perfect. The modern, clean lines allow the diner to feel at ease and peaceful so that the experience revolves around the food - the simple but delicious tastes of real, quality food, perfectly paired.  FANTASTIQUE!

Johnny was great to work with! He was professional, great with my kids and did the job quickly. His rates are very fair - he had a deal on Yelp at the time which I used. The lock he repaired is working perfectly - it has been a week and I expect it will be fine for the long haul. He didn't automatically try to talk me into replacing it - which I appreciate because it would have been more expensive (and with my knowledge of locks, he certainly could have told me it had to be replaced and I wouldn't have known the difference). Nice job, Johnny! See you next time!

Very good pho in the mall food court of all places! I count this as one of my faves for pho. I had the rare filet and it was delicious. The beef was good quality and the trimmings were fresh and cold. The price is also good and the staff (maybe the owner) are very friendly and accommodating!

Great place! Service is always friendly, the prices are good and the menu is awesome! They've taken this place from being a vacant McDonald's to something like a funky fast food restaurant/eatery-blend. Try them out, you'll be glad you did! They also have breakfast which I plan to try soon.
