The food was excellent tonight... The server was great. We have been to other Red Lobsters and we have not been satisfied. Tonight the food was fresh and tasted just how I have been imagining... Yum yum... I would definitely cone back to this location...

It should have been a sign that the food was not going to be good when they were too lazy to get the lights  turned on the outside of the building... My French fries were mushy and barely warm. Better referred as on their way to being mashed potatoes... Tacos didn't taste much better!!! The employees were all standing around with their thumbs in their butts wearing sweaters with hoodies over there heads. Unprofessional if you ask me. On the upside my soda was refreshing. Thank goodness that didn't get messed up...

I only give 1 star because it's not possible to do a 0. They have a whole 5 people maybe working behind the counter. This is our 2nd time in here because they messed up the dl. They were supposed to renew but instead just did a duplicate. What complete idiots they have working here. It's a complete waste of time. They should have done it right the first time. Every single time we have been here it's been a ridiculous line. This is absolutely horrible!!!! It's an hour just to get the number then 1-2 just to be helped... Awesome customer service here!!! Yeah right!!!

I don't like to give bad reviews, but I was not happy. It was empty in there when we got there and all we wanted was a steak. We were then told that the grill was down. This was after we were seated and getting our drinks. This information would've been helpful to know before we were even seated. So we got the pulled pork (was ok) fried chicken (tasted like it was reheated and very greasy) chicken wrap (not good) kids Mac and cheese (tasted like reheated and my son wouldn't even eat it) kids hamburger (was ok). So all in all we ate because we were hungry but it wasn't worth it at all. The reason I'm writing this is because as we were getting ready to go we heard someone order the steak.... I thought the grill was down  This will be our first and our last.

I have been using Paws for years now. Always excellent service for my dog and self. Tracy is always good with details and I wouldn't bring Rocky anywhere else. Thank you

Love getting my nails done here. They are fast, attentive, and affordable.. I won't go anywhere else. They also do great pedicures and eyebrow waxing.
