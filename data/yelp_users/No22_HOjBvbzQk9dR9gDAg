If I could give this hotel zero stars, I would. My sister in law checked in for us and we were guaranteed a room by 3pm and by 4pm a room still wasn't ready! She called and complained and then all of a sudden a room was ready. Then because we had so much stuff we needed a cart to help get everything up to the room but they don't allow you to bring the carts up yourself, so we had to wait well over an hour just to receive our belongings, and on top of that, you have to tip your bellhop! Then, our sinks were clogged and stunk of rotten eggs, and our air only worked one side of room and that took maintenance and room service over 2 hours to come tend to! Our pullout bed wasn't fully clean from the previous guests..and now to top it off, we are locked out of our room for the second time..but because my sister in law(whose name is on the room) isn't with us, they will not let us in our room! Even after we identified everything we own in our room! We have wasted so much time just sitting here waiting just to change! I know no staff member here gives two shits about this review but I hope other people read this and are swayed away from staying here! For how much money it is, it is not worth it at all whatsoever! Go somewhere who value their guests and who actually know how to handle a busy hotel! Quite frankly this has been the worst part of our trip, being in this bullshit hotel!

Where are the zero stars? I was raving about this place to my mom on the way to downtown Glendale because I have been here before...got seated pretty quickly, but our server (whose name I wouldn't even know because he never introduced himself) was less than friendly. When we ordered he let us know they may be out of one of our lunch choices, so he went to check and sure enough they didn't have it..so we ordered something else and he went back and put the order in. After about 10 minutes or so a lady(I'm assuming maybe the manager) came back to our table and let us know that they didn't have the other item we ordered either...are you kidding me?? I understand on the menu it says limited availability, but come on...how about your servers let your customers know ahead of time that certain menu items may not be ready yet, or better yet OUT!! The manager did offer another option but at that point we were upset and wanted to leave! We ended up taking our business over to the hop shop and it is amazing! Get your shit together haus murphys!!   Oh and from a former server and current restaurant manager, to whoever our awful server was...learn a thing or two about customer service, it goes a long way even if the food is out of stock!

I have only had Lo-Lo's once before and I loved it then! So today, my mom and sister in law mentioned how they had never been here before so we chose this for lunch and I am so happy we did! We had Mike as our server and he is awesome! Wonderful customer service skills and just so friendly!! As a manager at a restaurant it was nice to have the manager stop by and interact with us and other guests! The food was incredible(even though I ordered WAY too much)! We will definitely be back! If you're ever in, hopefully you get Mike as a server!

I have been to this place since it opened and I just love it here! The only struggle for me, is I do not live near the salon..but, I make the commute just because I love the service there! They are starting to get busier on the weekends which is a bummer when they can't always fit me in right away but none the less, I still like it there! David is AMAZING with nails and I would highly recommend him to do your nails if you're looking for a rockstar nail tech! I love that I've finally found a place I can constantly come back to and not leave feeling disappointed!
