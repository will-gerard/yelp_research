The best Mexican food in Maricopa County. Yes, it is. This is on South Central, just off the freeway so it's easy to get there from anywhere in the valley and it's worth the drive. It is always busy. There is always a wait. The wait is always worth it. Don't let the herd of people waiting put you off. Once you go inside it is a peaceful, tranquil dining environment with lots of space between tables for privacy and just a feeing of not being crammed in (are you listening, Scottsdale?)   The menu contains a lot of very traditional Mexican items which may or may not appeal outside the Latino community but it's full of standard items which anyone who likes Mexican food will recognize easily. This is Sonoran style with a twist. It's not nearly as heavy as most Sonoran but ingredients are fresh, flavors are awesome and service is superb. On my last visit I had the beef chimichanga, enchilada style with salsa verde. It's all made there. The salsa verde reminded me of some I had in New Mexico. It was fresh, tasty, tangy with a mild amount of heat. The chimi was huge, hanging off the plate huge. It was served with sour cream and fresh guacamole and I went at it like a piñata. Oh, it was good!   The salsa served with chips is perfect for me but if you are from Oshkosh or Missoula you might want to ask for something a bit milder, but please try it first. It's homemade and reminds me of flavors my people blend together in the Nayar Mountains. There is a lot going on there in terms of flavor. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu and they'll customize to your own tastes. Do I want grilled onions and jalapeños in my chimi? You bet I do.   Now a bit on the ambiance. This is in a Latino neighborhood and if you are from North Scottsdale you may need a few moments to feel comfortable around all of us. It's a very friendly, welcoming crowd and ALL are welcome. We're happy that you want to try something really authentic, so please come on down and join us and our families. Get neck deep in our culture and enjoy our food with us. Bring friends. Get a big table. Get some cerveza and enjoy a great meal. If you walk away hungry it's because you forgot how to use a knife and fork. No tiny portions here, so come ready for some Olympic grade eating.

Those who know me on Facebook know I love Costco. From tires to the pharmacy, the bakery, the optician (thanks Dr.s Ryan and Huang - I can see now) I love Costco for the variety and value it offers. I shop at the original "Price CLub on Morena in San Diego and also the Arcadia location in Phoenix. Both rock. I see the same people all the time who are helpful and friendly. Most would never be able to spot the store manager at the Arcadia store because more often than not you will see him stocking shelves. You just have to know that's the boss. That fits with my idea of management. When the boss is that hands-on, he's interfacing with customers and employees and knows what they have to deal with and can make better decisions. That's what makes Costco work so well. They work out great deals with vendors but they deliver a good shopping experience also.

These people are phone spammers WHO WILL NOT STOP! They call several times a day from three different numbers all with the same area code and prefix but the last four numbers fall into three repeat patterns. The calls always come through as Adobe Carpet Cleaning. Based on the harassment from these people I will never be a customer. I don't care if their service is the best on earth and free. They have harassed me for three months and will not stop calling in spite of numerous requests to be taken off their call list.

Helpful people, good prices, HEALTHY plants and as they say, they still do the digging. I'm convinced Home Depot and Lowe's get the leftovers, old, nearly dead, root bound plants which they sell at high prices. I got tired of that and stopped at Whitfill. It's enormous and they know what works here in the desert and what doesn't. They made great suggestions and then had my properly marked and brought everything out and "installed" the plants beautifully. They did a great job - better than I would have done.

I have never worked with a better contractor. AZ Cold AIr was prompt in setting up a meeting to look at our 16 year old system and advise on a replacement. The price was fair but Wayne explained all of the details and how we would have a "filter drawer" when they were done instead of the goofy system of bending filters and weighting them down. The installation was meticulous and testing was rigorous. APS wanted a ton of data in order to give us their rebate and Wayne provided that stack of written data. After one full season, the new Ruud system cut our electric bills by 30% and the winter gas bills by 40%. It is everything Wayne promised and then some but the installation is elegant. It looks like a professional job. We could not be happier.

This is THE Italian deli in Scottsdale. They have a small menu but will customize any way you want it and they do everything exceptionally well. It's family owned and run and guests are treated like family. The owner is reason enough to go. He's busy but will stop and talk with everyone. If you can talk to this incredible man and not leave smiling and feeling good, there is something wrong. He is picky about trimming out his meats and starts with the highest quality available. The pastrami is never, ever fatty or stringy. I can sink my mouth into a pastrami sandwich knowing it's going to be fantastic, every time. This place sweats the fine points all the time to deliver top quality but at very reasonable prices. Sauces are home made. Meatballs are home made. Well, everything is home made. It seriously doesn't get any better than this.

Mimi's Cafe takes a bit here and there from Puccini's La Boheme, at least thematically. In the opera, everyone is starving until Mimi and her rich, older boyfriend show up and pay the bill at a restaurant.   That theme goes a long way here because while Mimi's offers good food, it's not cheap and there is some trickery involved. However, Mimi does not die of tuberculosis in the end. Yeah, sometimes they should see the whole opera before pegging a restaurant to the theme.   When I walked in, I smelled a non-descript, yummy aroma of generic food that had a bit of baked bread, roasted apples, etc. I looked around this modern, air-conditioned building and saw that we were far from the kitchen. Then I looked up. I saw a small aroma atomizer near the ceiling running at full tilt. These devices emit chemical odorants and can be used to make a hotel lobby smell less like a locker room or in this case, to make people feel hungrier as soon as they hit the door. Really? You need to reach that low? At least it was out in the open and not hidden in the ductwork.   That disappointment out of the way, I have to say the food is good and it's creative. You can have a meal for very little or a lot if you use some self control. The aroma box is designed to skew one away from the simple and cheap toward the heartier fare. But again, the menu is extensive, the food is fresh and it is creative. For a chain restaurant it is different and dishes offer extra touches one just would not expect at an IHOP or similar place. Breakfasts are way more than eggs and gristle tubes (sausages) others serve. The breakfast menu is really good. Lunch is equally creative and very good.   So apart from the gimmickry of the theme and the aroma box at the door, this is a solid place to eat, converse, relax and get predictably good food at fair prices. I like it. It's not Paris on Anystreet, USA but it's a refreshing theme which works. They don't hit the customer over the head with the theme in decor or on the menu but it's a pleasant change and I will certainly be back.

I'm old enough to remember the original location on Van Buren. My parents remember driving through the stockyards to get there. The restaurant has moved but they're still delivering on the same great Italian dishes of the past and as far as I am concerned, the best pizza in town. It's comfortable, quiet, friendly and servers know the menu inside out and can answer any question you might have.   Their pizza is unique and old world. I like to get the large sheet pizza and take some home because it's just as good the next day for lunch. But let's start at the beginning. This is one of the last places that still brings fresh, Italian bread to the table when you sit down. It's crunchy on the outside, soft and delicate on the inside. This alone could be a meal but don't do that! There are even better things to come.   The manicotti is creative and even artistic. It's not like that stuff other places serve. It's just heavenly stuff. The eggplant parmigiana and stuffed eggplant are true wold-beaters. The pizza is priced like pizza, not like a gold Rolex and it's old world good. The Caesar salad is their own unique spin on a Caesar and the best I have ever had. The greens are really fresh. It's just a perfect Caesar.   The fun part is you can get a pizza or an entree and get a SMALL salad and/or side dish of pasta and sauce, meatballs and other sides at very reasonable prices. So go a bit wild as I did and get a big pizza, a small Caesar and a small (it's not all that small, either) dish of their amazing Fettuccini Alfredo. I shared my fettuccini around the table and man was it good. This is one of the few places where you can get a small side to add to an entree without having too much or having to spend a lot. $5 for the fettuccini we all shared. Very reasonable.   Riazzi's is about five blocks south of ASU on Mill so it's outside the crazy part of Tempe. If you want to skip the slow traffic in downtown to get there just take Hayden down to Alameda and then west. They have ample parking. Lighting in the parking lot could be better so if you have older people with you and it's after dark, you might want to bring a small flashlight. That said, the lighting isn't bad. It's just a big lot to cover with the lights they have.   This is another family-owned gem in the valley and worth the drive if you live outside Tempe. Prices are very reasonable and you won't go home hungry unless your hands are tied behind your back.

This hospital saved my father's life and got him on a program of health management which is giving him more real quality time and a great life  The doctors, nurses, assistants and admin staff are all wonderful and very pleasant. Then there is the army of dedicated volunteers to help people find their way and get information. They are great! This is also the cleanest hospital I have ever visited.  Every department is first class. The best doctors in the world practice here and if any trip to a hospital can be called pleasant, then this is the one that fits that description.   I also have to add a special comment about what is called "the cafeteria". This is the best use of understatement ever. If this is a "cafeteria" then a Rolls Royce is just a "car". Food is served 24/7 on a combination cook to order, hot prep and self serve basis which rivals anything at the best Scottsdale resorts and at fast food prices. This hidden gem is open to the public but is primarily there to serve staff and visitors. I admit to having lunch there when I am in the area because it is just so good. Imagine broiled sea bass with salsa verde and a spinach salad with cherry vinaigrette dressing and coffee for $6.74. The food is good, healthy, fresh and the dining area is pleasant even when crowded. The same great food is served to patients as permitted by their doctors. There is no wine list but that is the only thing that keeps this restaurant from taking on the finest upscale places in town. Personally, I'll settle for the great coffee and a fine meal at a great price.

It is just astonishing to think that a town which was once part of México can't manage to come up with any decent Mexican food. Los Olivos is all about "Sonoran style" which is heavy and greasy, but that aside, there is nothing inventive about anything on the menu. I ordered a shredded beef tostada and they did not bother to drained the boiled meat before assembling the thing. My tostada was basically soup with overcooked beef, tasteless vegetables and a very soggy tortilla and to top it off, it was stone cold when it arrived with grease congealing. I sent it back. A replacement never arrived. The margaritas were seriously overpriced and tasted like Kool-Aid with something really bitter added to it but for me, that was my dinner that night. Fortunately there is a Sonic drive-in not too far away which saved my evening.   Even the chips were greasy and encrusted with so much salt that we had to use our fingers to rake it off. The salsa is just average. The decor is interesting and Dalí-esque but I can get enough of a look by driving by and next time I will keep going. How this place manages to stay open is a mystery, but to be fair, Scottsdale does not set the bar very high for Mexican food. It's as if all of the owners get together monthly to review their crappiness scores to make sure nobody is doing it right and making the others look bad. Honestly, Taco Bell is a better choice.   Ugh!

I wish Yelp allowed negative stars, stinkweeds or something to show utter disapproval of the infamous "Dr. Kaye" and his fraudulent operation. Kaye has two offices and lives off MediCare payments. By having two offices he can bounce victims, um, patients from one to the other and get them in twice as often, billing Medicare more frequently than they actually allow.   Our adventure with this "doctor" began with an ER visit in 2010 when my father had a urinary blood clot. They dealt with that at the hospital but recommended he follow up with Dr. Kaye, who was certainly not present at the hospital that night. An appointment was made and kept.   The so-called "doctor" spends very little time with patients and talks into his tape recorder the whole time. The first appointment was to tell my father how to go home and remove the ER-fitted catheter himself. No examination occurred but the "doctor" made sure to schedule another appointment at his other office. I took papa to that appointment and was present in the exam room. Kaye came in, talked into his tape recorder and spent two minutes, forty-seven seconds with us. The whole time he talked about more appointments and a "procedure" they just had to do to stick a camera up papa's urethra to look around. Then he walked out. Two and a half minutes and it was all about more appointments. Papa had enough of the guy and went back to his GP who blanched at the idea of an invasive procedure which would cause irritation and mask any problems that actually existed. He made disparaging remarks about Kaye and ordered a partial MRI which turned up no problems.   We thought we had seen the last of the infamous Dr. Kaye. Flash forward to September, 2013, more than three years later. A bill arrived showing that on that 2:47 appointment in 2010, a "bladder scan" was performed and that papa owed a co-pay of SEVENTY THREE CENTS. CENTS! Not only was this never performed, but Medicare had been billed and paid all but the 73 cents and that's the only way we found out about the billing for a service that was never performed.   At the bottom of the bill was the following. The all-caps are theirs: "CALL OUR OFFICE TO AVOID FURTHER COLLECTION ACTIVITY!! ALL ACCOUNT BALANCES MUST BE PAID IN FULL BY OCT 15, 2013 OR SENT TO COLL AGENCY. Insurance last billed on May 28, 2010."  So not only has Dr. Kaye billed Medicare fraudulently for a procedure which never took place but he's now threatening patients three years after the fact and they spent 46 cents in postage in an effort to collect 73 cents.   We're putting together sworn affidavits to go to Medicare over this fraud, but this is the way "doctor" Kaye operates. He's all about appointments, getting signatures on his sign-in sheet and billing. He doesn't give a hoot about patients, doesn't provide any medical care at all and sees people as numbers on a balance sheet. We are going to do our best to take him down in court if necessary.

It seems I practically live here. It's a great place because of its relaxed atmosphere, good A/C and great food at very reasonable prices. This was the Alley Cat years ago but has been the Blue Moose for over 20 years and it really has a local vibe to it. It's all very real and not fake/scottsdale and that's hard to do when you are wedged in between the Scottsdale Center for the Arts and the Museum of Modern Art. They always keep it real and it's great whether I'm having a business lunch with their great iced tea or stopping in after work for one of MANY great beers or coming back for dinner with my family. It works on all of those levels and is equally comfortable.   Everything I have ever had off the menu has been fresh and freshly prepared. While this may look like a bar, it's a restaurant with a great sports bar. Big screens and good drinks surround but it's a place where I go to eat. Nine bucks for a Moose Club Sandwich that is so tall that two Swedes could not shake hands over it? Gimme! Oh yeah, the fries. Mmmm. Perfectly done and they have not been sitting under a warming lamp, either. The Reuben. Gimme. It's great. I could go on and on.   The friendly service and weekend entertainment are always cool aspects to a visit at the Blue Moose and it's really my go-to place for business, family, hanging with co-workers and a place where I take out of town guests for a non-pretentious Scottsdale experience.

I managed to find a place that is actually worse than Los Sombreros and Los Olivos! Scottsdale is known for food but very average food, but even with those low expectations, this small restaurant failed to live up to its "New Mexico" theme or to the definition of anything that I would consider fit to eat. it's a bit like dining in a small warehouse, crammed in with other people just a bit too closely and having to speak Spanish so that the bored people at nearby tables won't listen in. That works because we were the only Latinos anywhere near the place.   I don't expect Mexican food in restaurants to be like what we have at home so I don't go with preconceived ideas to judge a place but food should be hot and I should not have to pick hard "things" out of my teeth as I eat it. A margarita out of a bottle should not cost seven bucks. These are just basic, common-sense items. Other reviews speak of inconsistency in food and service. I guess we hit it on a very bad night, but we won't be back.

This used to be THE go-to place for pizza when I was in Scottsdale on business, but sadly, no more. Previous good experiences have been overshadowed significantly. They offer Internet ordering where a specific pick-up time could be specified. They often run out of dough for the Sicilian deep-dish pizza (odd, that) so I had always ordered early for pick up around 7PM for a casual meeting with colleagues.   On one trip I ordered a pizza around noon for pickup at 7. I arrived at 7 and was given the pizza. They opened the box at the darkened counter and it looked ok. When I got it back to our hotel I could see something was wrong. The pizza was hard as a plank of wood. It was completely dried out, shriveled and could only be cut with a saw. The work ticket still attached to the box revealed the mystery. They had actually made the pizza when it was ordered even though the ticket listed a 7PM pickup. The pizza then sat there for seven hours and was then sold to me. Not only was it inedible. It was probably dangerous.  NYPD made it right. They refunded my money and gave me a gift certificate for another pizza. On my next trip, the pizza was better but the fresh Roma tomatoes I ordered were replaced by hard, dried tomatoes which had not been re-hydrated. Dried tomatoes can be great if re-hydrrated properly but that wasn't what I ordered and these were just dried strips thrown on, and way too many of them.  I also noticed that the box kept getting smaller and the pizza inside no longer filled the shrinking box. Prices have remained relatively steady even though the economic mess but quality and portion size have gone to hell.  Pizza expectations in Arizona have never been very high but NYPD was once a bright spot there. No longer.

This is one of the very few SERVICE stations left on earth. They have been around forever, keep current and provide quick to extensive repairs. They have helped me out with dead batteries and even racing fuel for my exotic car. They charge a bit more for petrol but you get your oil checked, the glass cleaned and the tires checked. They are also friendly and professional. This is an excellent resource to have and to keep here in da hood of PV.

UPDATE: 08/26/2009 - It is now being reported that this restaurant has officially closed, permanently.   This used to be a great place fore breakfast or lunch in Scottsdale. They had a manager (Robert) who was omnipresent, looking after everything. When they let him go, the place started to rot - literally. The carpets were worn and dirty, the chairs were grimy and then the County Health Department began writing them up for repeat critical violations like leaving cooked sausage out overnight in food prep areas (be my guest and look it up). Food quality began to suffer as recipes and ingredients were changed. Cheese sauce which used to be made there was coming out of a can. Portions shrank as prices increased. The crowd dwindled.   On my most recent visit, the restaurant was closed with a sign by the door saying "Closed for the summer". This place has never closed in the summer. I think it may simply be gone now, never to reopen and that's probably a good idea. With all of the health dept. write-ups for broken and cracked seals on things, refrigerators not working, dangerous food handling techniques, it seems the owners have been riding it out and not it's just over. Probably a good thing.

I live dangerously close to this Trader Joe's and I give into temptation at least twice a week and stop in. This store is off the hook. It's well run and all of the employees are amazing and know the store inside out. The Temptress du Jour in the back corner always has something great to sample. Wine selection is very good and dairy...oh yeah. My Belgian chocolate pudding is a must have. I need a medical alert bracelet that says if I'm unconscious, just to inject a tub of that stuff into me. A lot of stores sell colorful flowers but TJ's is sensible about it, offering selections which don't need to be kept in a fridge and which won't die on the way out to the car.   This brings me to the point that every TJ's is individualized to its neighborhood. They want to give people what they want to eat while challenging us along established likes. If you shop at a TJ's in another state and like something they don't carry at another store, just ask and they will make a note of it. I hardly expect them to individualize around me alone but they appreciate feedback and take it seriously.   TJ's was one of the first to adopt Apple Pay so I can pay with my watch and be on my way, making this dangerously close encounter that much more efficient. I love the place. I love the inspirations, the unique food items, the French wines, well, just all of it. It's just a good place to shop.

Wow! Real, East Coast Italian food does exist in Arizona! This is a small, family-owned place in South Scottsdale that is more of a carry-out place with very limited seating, but it has real charm. Sitting between racks of wine and condiments kind of reminded me of the entrance to Filippi's on San Diego's India Street. It's instant cultural immersion.   The meatball and pizza sub sandwiches were great. The bread - man, the bread was just like what you get in Italy. The Caesar salad contained Italian olives. Everything was just perfect and the sandwiches are so big that you can take home half for dinner. It's a small place so a t peak times you will wait for one of the few tables but you can call ahead and your order will be ready when they say it will be ready.   This is a deli where you can choose salads, sandwiches and full dinners to go or just pick up a few salads to enhance dinner at home. So deli, restaurant, grocery, take out. This place is unique but just open the door and your nose will tell you that you are at the right place. The food is fantastic, priced right and a real pleasant find in a city which disappoints too often but hides real gems like this that just have to be found.

Okay, I live up the street. I remember when this was a small, open air mall. Times have changed. It's huge. It has everything from sports memorabilia to Italian fashion. It's a place where I like to people-watch. I'm not a big customer here because the place just has a bit too much of the "Snottsdale" feeling to it. By that I mean people trying to impress each other and themselves. They never buy much, but they walk around with their noses in the air. That's okay. It's the culture of Scottsdale and I accept that. It is fun to sit down and observe and listen in on the one-upmanship that goes on.   I patronize many of the companies that are represented at SFS, just not there. I waled into one store for an item I knew they carried. The sales girl had no clue. I pointed to it and she picked up the wrong one. They have an AT&T store which is virtually bare of products. Why? But this isn't a criticism of the mall, but of Scottsdale and this mall gives Scottsdale what it wants: Image and little substance.   But that's the community this mall serves and it's a good fit. I don't need to pay to see the circus when I can come here for free. It's just plain amusing.

When the increasingly creepy chef-owner Jeff Smedstad lost his half of the restaurant in a divorce, we had hopes that this place might actually serve normal food. Jeff's penchant had been to offer cutesy specials which were all presentation and no substance and sneer at anyone who dared to order from the menu. Sad to say, things have gone from worse to "worser". Mystery meat abounds. Strips of chicken skin fill the rolled-up items. It as if this is a convenient way to get rid of the garbage rather than having it hauled off. The food ranged from barely acceptable to disgusting.   It's a tiny place in the Pep Boys parking lot, housed in what used to be a veterinary clinic (no joke). So perhaps that's why the cuisine is reminiscent of something made out of the day's losers at Turf paradise. Margaritas taste like antifreeze unless you order the super premiums which won't leave any money left for ordering food and that may be a good choice. Portions are small and overpriced  but if you get there before the Pep Boys garage closes you can dine to the sound of air wrenches and tire machines. Ah, so romantic.   A true godawful experience.

I have loved Pita Jungle for some time, so this review is overdue. The concept is simple yet creative, HEALTHY food. You won't find anything dripping butter or hunks of fat here. It's a place to see healthy cuisine put on a pedestal, rotated and dressed up incredibly. I have learned from Pita Jungle that the mushroom is an under-appreciated food. They do amazing things with mushrooms! The portabello mushroom "burger" feels as meaty as a beef burger without the fat, cholesterol and the other life-shortening stuff.   The thing I find most amazing is that while I order all of these cool veggie dishes there, I always walk away full and it stays with me. I'm happy, alert and don't feel like a swallowed a boat anchor.   This Scottsdale location is one of several around the valley but it has become my favorite in a hurry. The staff is very friendly, attentive and service is fast and efficient. Service with a great big smile, great food and you can linger if you want or grab something and get to a movie. Pita Jungle has really converted this meat eater. It's not often one can say this but I think PJ is helping add time to my life with their food but they are also encouraging a lifestyle change for me which I see as a real gift.   There are other eateries nearby but I'll stand in line if I have to in order to eat here. It's worth the wait and it's not even a long wait.

This is a small corner of gastronomic heaven in Arizona. Having spent a part of my life in Germany, I became addicted to the breads there and while our climate isn't even close to that of Germany, Old Heidelberg Bakery does an admirable job of turning out authentic breads and pastries. I don't know what it is about a simple roll that can be so wonderful but they get it right with a crusty outside and an almost creamy inside. The rye breads and strüdel are also outstanding. They also believe in the "baker's dozen" concept here. GO early because they sell out, especially on Saturdays.   In addition to baked goods, Old Heidelberg has a small German goods store selling everything from sausages to chocolates, jars of vegetables and other goodies from Germany and even bath items. While it's not like walking around the market areas of Munich, this is a great place to get some good breads and other vital supplies of civilization. Prices are very reasonable and service is very good but there is often a small crowd so there is often a short wait to be served.

BS West has not changed. It is still an overpriced, unfriendly, cliquish place where anyone who does not frequent the place will be stared at and commented about by loud drunks in the dark corners. This is the kind of place which reinforces negative gay stereotypes and gives straight people the feeling they are at a zoo, observing gay people in their natural habitat. The best part about going here is leaving and not looking back.

I have watched one German restaurant after another close in the Phoenix area, and had never driven all the way to Glendale to try Haus Murphy's until last night. We were blown away by the great food, relaxed atmosphere and just the good sense of fun there. We will definitely make the trek back for the German beer and desserts alone!   We had Jaeger Schnitzel and Beef Rouladen. Both were authentic, just like I remember from my time in Germany. Both were cooked perfectly. The red cabbage and spaäzle were home made and delicious. The potato pancakes were perfectly done. Our server was attentive and friendly.   The crowd is very local. This isn't a touristy place. I could tell most had been there before and for good reason. It was a Friday night and this was the happiest place in the county. There is nothing pretentious, snooty or snobby (are you listening, Scottsdale) about this place. It was just good people having a good time and enjoying good food. Forget the glittery junk of restaurants that want you to forget about the food out of boxes. This place looks like a below street level restaurant I found in Triberg, Germany, right down to the aroma of the onions in the potato pancakes.   Prices are fair for what you get. This is labor-intensive food made with good ingredients and you get plenty of it. We went hungry so we could enjoy dessert and a litre of German beer. The sauerkraut cake was the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted and the Black Forest Cake was superb!   Downtown Glendale has also come a long way over the years. It was quaint, beautiful, safe and fun. There was a barber shop still open at 6:30pm and lots of small shops were still open when we left at 8:30. The downtown area reminded me of Scottsdale back when it was local, decent and fun, years ago.   We are looking forward to going back!

I have to add another star. We were just there again last night and the food and service were once again the very best. There is nothing pretentious about this place. It's like sitting down in a relative's kitchen to have dinner. it's just comfortable, right down to the mounted jigsaw puzzle of the Alps on the wall. It's friendly and about real people having great food and a great time. There is no attitude here, just a friendly welcome, great servers, fantastic German food and great music by Duane and Elmer. I can't wait to go back!

So what does $122 buy for dinner these days? It buys a "tasting menu" with wines of some of the most eclectic food on the planet. Quail eggs on the same plate with a mini sloppy joe. Okay. This is another of those nouveau fine dining places that is trying to break with the traditions of the past and offer a "We're your best buddy - come into our home for dinner" concept. For atmosphere it mostly achieves that goal and is a rather warm and friendly place. Fellow diners were having a good time and the restaurant just had a good feel to it. It did not seem fake or plastic nor did I feel the staff staring at me as if they wanted to plunge a steak knife into my back just for showing up (I'll leave that to POSH way down the road). No, this place felt good, smelled good and really nailed what a drama teacher told me once: "When you can fake sincerity, you have the world in your hands." This is after all a business, not my Aunt Maria's house. They are out to make a profit by serving guests and this is one place in the Scottsdale area that seems to understand that people don't fork over this kind of money only to be treated like scum.   Ambiance aside, the prices here are truly insane. I did not reach a level where I can afford a meal like this by spending on a meal like this, but friends wanted to go, so there. If you are doing a client entertainment event, make sure you photograph the menu so your company auditors and the IRS will believe you.   The food. Well, it's so "out there" that one cannot really compare it to anything else. It would be a lot like comparing a Ford Crown Vic to a Whoopeedoo SX30000 fictional car. You just can't do it. I think that's the point. The chef/owner wants to be as different as possible, offering up some really weird sounding, looking and tasting items along with some unique spins on more traditional fare, again, avoiding comparisons.   There is a culinary undercurrent in Scottsdale that just tries too hard to set itself apart from the mainstream rather than concentrating on pleasing guests. Chef Binkley seems to have a better grasp of pushing the diner out of his/her own comfortable rut than most. There is the "What the hell is that?" item along with something that looks friendly, known and happy.  But Binkley's suffers from an acute, but curable case of Scottsdalearrhea, which is a condition inflicted by the many Scottsdale culinary schools which try to one-up each other in the "artistic presentation" category. An as example, this school of thought would serve up a peanut butter sandwich, cut into multiple, miniature octagonal shapes, arranged in a scimitar pattern and covered with a half cucumber canopy supported by pillars made of strands of sugar, decorated with violets and orange peel. That's what Binkley's is all about. It's not the food, it's the art. If that's what you are into, you will be pleased. If you are not particularly hungry, you will be pleased. After which you can stop by the Horny Toad for one of their average burgers  so you can feel you had something to eat.   I'm just sorry but for $122, to leave feeling the need to stop at a fast food drive-thru just isn't right. But eating is not what Binkley's is about. It's about seeing and being seen, being able to say you dropped a wad on "dinner" and being able to impress people. Go for the ambiance, have an overpriced drink and an appetizer and move on would be my best advice.

I absolutely love this grocery store. We don't have anything like it in San Diego, possibly because we are so close to the border that we can drive across to a Gigante any time we want. I really don't know, but I wish I had a store like this in my neighborhood. It's like a cool piece of México right in South Scottsdale. They have ALL kinds of great Mexican and Mexican-american foods and ingredients, many from small companies including the family-owned Poblano salsa company from Tucson. Try getting their Salsa Ranchera in Tijuana. I TAKE it to Tijuana!   Food city has a Mexican deli and panaderia serving up everything from Mexican wedding cookies and cakes to really good, spicy guacamole and ceviche. The chili colorado was outstanding. They feature lots of Mexican soft drinks and Lala yogurt. If you like yogurt and have not had Lala mango or peach yet, leave tire marks in the driveway to go get some. Mmmm.   The meat department caters to Latin tastes. You won't find $50/pound filet mignons there but you will find really good carne asada and other cuts ready to cook the way we cook. Produce is very high quality and very reasonably priced. I can't find tomatillos anywhere in the area of San Diego where I live but Food City has them in abundance. All you need is a food processor and some creativity and you've got salsa fresca.   I have always found employees to be very friendly and helpful with managers who jump in and ring up orders, stock shelves or whatever else needs to be done. I also enjoy the people who shop there. I just wish I had this store close to home and could visit more often than I can on business trips to the Phoenix area. I can't shop to conjunto music in any other store unless I am South of the border. :)

I live on the opposite side of town but I made the trip out to Avondale because of great reviews. I had been treated like garbage by Riverview Toyota which has changed a lot since I bought my car and fellow Yelpers were very encouraging about Avondale Toyota. For good reason. They are professional and they are busy. They have enough people to take care of their customers and they do what they say they will do. They even made allowances for me coming from Scottsdale so I could get some basic services done while I waited and I really appreciated that.   I walked the lot and they do have a lot of inventory. Since inventory goes to the dealers that move it, the number of new cars on the lot is generally an indicator of the health of the dealership. They had a lot of cars and they were making deals. My previous dealer (Riverview) has practically none and two years ago their lot looked like Avondale's. So cars on the lot are a pretty good indicator of how healthy a dealership is and if one is trending up or down.   I was greeted when I drove in, did not have to go around looking for someone. They had me on the appointment list and got me checked in quickly. They're friendly and professional here and not a bunch of sharks looking for ridiculous upsells like well, another dealership.   One item to do was an oil and filter change. When I got the car back, I opened the hood and pulled the dipstick. The service advisor thought this was curious. I told him I was checking to see that new oil had been put in the engine after experiencing a non-change oil change at Riverview once. He was aghast and could not believe his ears. Yep. I said, "That's why I drove all the way out here to do business with you guys." Then something amazing happened. He said he was glad I was their customer but that they expected to keep earning my business and not be a "better than that" alternative. What a great attitude!   It is totally worth the drive for me even though I'm an hour away. I'll keep coming here and will have my car towed here if necessary because of the way I was treated.

This is one of the newer Paul's Hardware stores and I love it. It's a smaller version of the flagship store at Scottsdale and McDowell, tailored to the needs of the neighborhood. That's important. They try to stock items that will be helpful for repairs of the type and vintage construction in the area as well as a vast array of tools and household supplies.   So, the flexible in-tank fuel line for your weed whacker decayed and broke. They have it! It's on a spool by the foot. Buy some extra. Need a duplex outlet plug in Decora white? They've got it. Need some art brushes to do some touch-ups or need some appliance touch up paint? They have it. A/C filters? Just ask for the size and they'll offer about three grades.   From pool sweep hoses to fifty kinds of glue, they have it here. In the odd case they don't have a particular item, the main store downtown probably does and they can call and find out for you.   This is a local, family-owned business. Paul's daughter runs the company and she's hands-on. They are all about customer service and won't ever walk right by you without offering to help like in the big box stores. Prices are very competitive with those Home Labyrinth places but Paul's was here long before those companies even existed. They've been helping local people for decades and it's a pleasure to be one of their many happy customers.   Oh yeah, free popcorn!

The way Robert McGrath talks about Eddie, I expected to see him come down from a cross and heal the sick. I let the over-hype slide and we went there to try it out. It's a busy place. There is energy there if you are into that. It has more of a German beer hall atmosphere to me with all of the noise. It's not really a place to have an intimate conversation, catch up on the day or be romantic. It's a place to eat.  The menu is extensive enough but not so big that one thinks they're out of control in the kitchen. Nope. I think they have it balanced pretty well. That was a good sign. Prices struck me as being more than I like to pay for dinner in a fine dining place and this really wasn't fine dining to me. So from the beginning I was curious about the value-for-money tradeoff.   Appetizers are priced like entrees in most restaurants so that put us off. Nine bucks for soybeans? That was the "cheap" appetizer. They range up to $20. Quite frankly, nothing on the appetizer menu really appealed to us, so we ordered salads. We had a Caesar and an organic iceberg for $10 each. Nothing really memorable. The grilled onions on the iceberg salad were weird and the olive tapenade on my caesar was equally weird.   We ordered some of the signature dishes. Gotta say the bacon-infused meatloaf was good, but it wasn't great. It wasn't worth $21. Portion size is small, even by Scottsdale standards where some places should bring out a magnifying glass with the main course. It was too small. For that kind of money I can make enough really good meatloaf to feed the whole family and the neighbors and still buy a six of Bud to go with it. They have a half size for $12 which would classify as an appetizer.  The chicken asiago was good but at $21 just did not meet our value-for-money criteria. It was decent, not memorable.  Compounding the value-for-money equation is the fact that they don't serve ANY side dishes. Nothing. Those are extra. They have a decent selection for $8 each. They sounded good but by this time we were already feeling wallet abuse.   I just feel that where Eddie's falls down is on price. It's an expensive place and I don't feel the food or the experience deliver what I'm expecting when my partner and I go out and spend over $100 for dinner. We felt cheated by our experience. This could be a much better place if they dropped the attempts to freakify standard dishes and got the prices out of the stratosphere. I hear their filet is good but at $39, I won't be trying it.   So, bigger portions, fewer odd combinations, lower prices would be needed to get us back there. I don't like getting home from dinner and having to say, "It's good to be home."

Any car dealership is complicated. They are multiple "stores" under one roof, often competing with each other in an effort to be the best each month. It's a life of pressure behind the scenes and I know that. That said, Brent Berge's Riverview Toyota has always done right by me whether with service or a new car purchase.   I like to tell a joke as follows: "How do you know if you've been reamed on a car deal? Do you own a car?" The simple fact is that any dealer is a business which is there to make money. They don't let product off the lot unless they are making money on it. I get that too. Whether a dealer is fair, decent and honest is what sets them apart and in my experience, Riverview Toyota stands apart from the crowd in these areas.   I have been a customer of service both warranty and paid and have been treated fairly and repairs have been handled efficiently. I have always felt that they respected me and my property.   As a two time new car customer I feel I have received good treatment. This dealership changed owners from Larry Miller (when I bought my first car) to Brent Berge and there is a difference in the way the place "feels" after that change. It's more relaxed, friendlier and just better all around. It's not the sort of place a person dreads entering, as some can be.   In my most recent purchase, I never felt pressured. To the contrary, I felt as if they were reading my mind. That was a little eerie at first until it hit me that this is their job. It's their job to match the customer with the right car and the right deal and they made this a simple, fluid process and helped me feel good and confident about doing business there. Fleet sales was great. That's the no-nonsense end of any car dealer and I like that but what was unique was they brought in a salesman who is presumably being compensated, to show me all of the car's systems, take care of the paperwork and see to my general satisfaction. So it wasn't a "Here, out the door" fleet deal at all. They took time to help me get to know a very different new car and seemed to know intuitively where I would have some questions. There was never any rush to get me out and on the road. They took time.   The only criticism I have is one that is universal for me. The money guy who handles the final paperwork and payment/financing, etc. makes a brick look exciting. It goes with the job because every dealer has one of these. They're robots who march through forms and they all have the personality of gravel. I'd like to see that same friendly ambiance extend into that final office as well, but to his credit, he was honest and efficient.   I like this dealership. I know no dealership can please everybody 100% but I feel they have always gone out of their way to make me happy and to earn my business. When they look you in the eye and say, "We want you to come back and if we ever disappoint, we want to know about it", that's pretty good in the world today.  I can see not everyone is happy and those who are not should speak out, but I'm happy.

While my overall experience with Riverview Toyota was a good one, I have to take my rating down to one star based on something I caught them at after I bought a car there. I told the fleet guys and the salesman that I was going to be paying cash for the car. This was clearly understood. The salesman quietly whipped out a form saying, "We just need to get down all of your information" and began filling it out upside-down while asking me questions. This turned out to be a loan application. I said I was paying cash and the salesman said, "Oh, this is just the form we use. No problem." A few weeks later I learned that they had done a hard hit on my credit and because I had not asked for any credit, sent me a form letter saying I had been "denied credit". As it turns out, my credit score took a temporary hit of a few points and bounced back even higher than it was before, but the outright LIE, the deception and the hit on my credit without my approval really angers me. Their "finance manager", Mike Powell clearly gets a commission off of loans and became very terse and unpleasant when I got out my checkbook. He's a real horse's *ss. The fleet guys have their act together but you have to watch the front and back of the store when doing business here. If I should buy another car from them, I'll have my lawyer in tow to go through the paperwork. I've heard they pulled this same trick on LOTS of people, so it looks like the finance office there is running its own little dirty game in house.

So how bad does it have to be to throw away the remaining free-included new car services? Pretty bad. I made an appointment online for a free tire rotation and "inspection". The "Assistant Service Manager" was long on ass but short on service. He seemed never to have been near a car before. He did not know how to get the odometer off trip to total miles. Oh yeah, they had no record of my service appointment even though they had emailed me confirmation.  Two hours later, to do a tire rotation I can do in my drive way in 30 minutes, the upsell began. While being careful not to say my car had any problem at all, they said based on miles I "need" an alignment (with perfect tire wear?) and a balancing and a cabin air filter. All for the fun price of $235 plus taxes. Well, it doesn't need an alignment at $85 and $50 for balancing is ridiculous and not needed (gee, Costco does that for free when you buy tires there so guess where I'm going) and the $55 for the air filter is a total ripoff. I priced it out at Pep Boys at $10.99.  For even more fun, they could not find my key and spent 15 minutes trying to find it so I could get out of there. The phrase "Incompetent Wankers" comes to mind. I'm not letting these clowns near my car again. I'll scrub the next free oil change and do it myself along with tire rotations.  One last thing. The list of services performed states they cleaned the cabin air filter. I just pulled it and it was never touched. I blew out bits of desert plant flower petals. I can conclude they didn't do a damn thing to my car today.

Never in the history of gastronomy has there been a more clean-cut love-it-or-hate-it dining concept as POSH Improvisational Cuisine. I was literally dragged here by friends who had enough credit left on their cards and who wanted to show me how "out there" Scottsdale could be.   POSH is different. Really different. You don't order. You check off a long list of things you like and don't and they concoct something on the fly for you. You'll never know what you are about to be served or what it will cost but you can assume it will be strange and so expensive that you will be able to watch your FICO score drop.  This is a place that is trying to be the snootiest restaurant ever while pretending to be a relaxed, friendly environment. I did see some normal people but I saw a lot of the types one sees in North Scottsdale and San Marcos, Ca. You know the type. Those out to impress - mostly themselves by being different. Really different.   If art is what you like instead of food, this is the place to be. It is all about presentation and dulcet tones describing what has just been put in front of you. It really is a beautiful presentation, but I have no freakin' idea what it was even after asking for the explanation to be translated "into a language". Descriptions are a lot like a real estate brochure: "Spacious, upscale, beautiful, wonderful, elegant" without any hint of substance. It tasted like tuna that had been marinated in a puddle and hit with some soy sauce. The teepee of veggies that hovered above it was interesting. I didn't know whether to eat it or wrap a tortilla around it and re-enact the night before the battle at the Little Bighorn in miniature.   I just don't get or like the concept so perhaps I am being unfair to this hole in the wall on Scottsdale Road in a building that looks like a bombed out munitions factory from Dresden, Germany, circa 1944. People live in that place? It reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange". Yeah, big bucks to live above the store. I get it. It's Scottsdale and this is "trendy". Do a foreclosure and resale search of that zip code and you'll see that at least seventy percent of the building is up for sale, often with notations such as "Fully furnished" and "Motivated seller". I bet they're motivated. It all fits with the wannabe nature of POSH and the people it seeks to inculcate.    POSH is a restaurant where only the truly adventurous need apply after checking their credit worthiness. It's a niche restaurant and I'm clearly (and happily) not in that niche. For a totally unique and almost otherworldly dining experience, this is the place. They have NO competition in this area. They are without peer when it comes to originality and invention on a scale beyond comprehension. This is the area where POSH shines. If AZ88 is your thing, this is AZ88 on a combo of crack and meth. I did not care for this place but I am sure the feeling is mutual. While I feel the food merits one star based on goofiness and price, I'm giving POSH two stars just for having the cojones to push out this concept on Scottsdale and not to crack a smile when delivering the check.

My Dutch Bros. experience began at their main store at 6th and D in Grants Pass, Oregon. The concept has translated to Arizona particularly well, giving the other coffee companies a real run for their money. Baristas are the friendliest, warmest people and they serve up really creative coffee and fruit drinks at very reasonable prices and the iced and frozen drinks are perfect for the hot climate.   I had the good fortune to have been in town on opening day of this location and already had a DB sticker in the back window of my car. I knew what to expect based on years of patronage of the company in the Northwest and this store really delivered every bit of the Dutch Bros. experience and has done so every time I have stopped in.   Unlike those "other" coffee companies, DB makes a fantastic regular coffee which to me is the measure of any coffee establishment. They start with great coffee and then add enhancements to turn it into an experience. At way less than other places charge, it's a great deal and the friendly, efficient service makes me always want to go back. Well done, DB. You have a great thing going.

Scottsdale Municipal Services truly suck the big one and swallow. We never received a water bill in August. Today, 9/5/14, we received a bill showing a past due amount "due IMMEDIATELY" and a $5 late fee for a bill we never received. I called Water Services and was directed to "Revenue Recovery" as if I'm some sort of deadbeat. I explained my problem and the woman on the other end became terse, rude and downright nasty. "Well, we use the same mail everyone else uses so it's not our responsibility if you don't get your bill." So I'm supposed to drive to where they print their bills and pull mine off the line? Is that it?   The conversation got worse as I tried to explain that it's unfair to penalize me for a bill I never got. "Well, you can have it taken out of your checking account (for a fee)" Oh, like I'm going to trust this slimy bunch of perverts with my bank account and routing numbers. Like hell I will.   The end result is that I can take a full day of my time to file a formal protest which will go before a board of review to see if they can waive the $5 "late fee". I know their time isn't worth anything but mine is. I guess they are really telling me that need to steal a plant from the park to get my $5 back.   There were a lot of ways the city could have handled this communication which would not have angered or antagonized me but the PMS Queen chose to speak in condescending tones and tell me it's my responsibility to police the US Postal Service. So I overpaid by a penny just so they have to post it as a credit. Next month, another penny and so on until I have my $5 back in manual processing time.

I LOVE the Ferragamo brand, the quality, the fit. There isn't anything I don't love about the products but this particular store falls short. It is over-lit for one thing. I felt a need for dark glasses in there. Products are displayed in a very sterile manner which left me thinking, "Is this all they've got? Just a lesson, look at your San Diego/Fashion Valley store, compare and then fix the problems at the Scottsdale store.   The one thing which really put me off was the two rather young sales girls which were literally perched just inside the store like vultures on a perch, waiting. This reminded me of the old Westward Pontiac in Phoenix (North 7th Street and Highland, a block south of Camelback). There they had the showroom up on a raised platform several feet above the parking lot. In front of it they had a metal railing where salesmen would hang out, literally like perched vultures waiting to fly off and swoop down on a customer. The two girls at Ferragamo brought back that vivid memory.   Give the brand the respect it deserves. Don't let your sales girls stand there eyeballing people as they walk by. It's creepy. It's intimidating. It really put me off. Dim the lights and get more product in the store. I go there to buy really fine shoes, not to look at the latest in commercial wall light sconces. Ferragamo is SO much better than the impression this store leaves. I headed to Nordstrom to see Ferragamo stuff.   Then again, it's Scottsdale. Without a certain amount of tacky, things don't fit.

Simply put, they got the message. The staff was not only better trained but genuinely engaging, helpful and fun. That's the Ferragamo image and it's great to be able to upgrade this fine store!

Nothing has worked in this location which is convenient and has good parking because each horrific incarnation at this spot is trying to be some kind of snooty, trendy place to attract the "in" crowd. Word, the "in" crowd went bust on credit card debt. If you want to survive, cater to real people who care about what they are eating.   I was dragged here against my better judgment while attending a meeting in Scottsdale. The place was empty at 7pm. That indicates there is usually a reason. The snooty hostess seated the group but I was already smelling something I did not like. It's an odor one finds in a Mexican restaurant that uses it's oil way too long and has other kitchen issues. The decor is bizarre for a Mexican place and the menu is trying too hard to impress. When I saw the runny plastic goo called chile con queso come out that several had ordered and smelled the stale chips, I actually faked a phone call to get out of there. I had my own car and headed to a bar I know downtown that has never let me down.   The next day I polled my compadres about dinner and impressions ranged from "just ok" to "awful". I'm indigenous Mexican and pretty hard to please so I'll let those comments tell the story, but if you want real Mexican food, go to the deli at Food City at McKellips and get a green chile burrito and some salsa quemada. $1.29, smells good and tastes good. Skip the $18 entrees and Papi Chulos altogether.

A fellow Yelper saw my plea and came to my rescue with Blue 32 Sports Grill. Specifically I was in search of a Monte Cristo sandwich. Okay, not the healthiest choice to have a big ham and Swiss battered and deep fried then dusted with powdered sugar but it's been ages! Three of us tried Blue 32 out for lunch and were very impressed.   It's a big place with a section off the bar with high-top seating and an outdoor patio for whenever it may cool down, a big bar area and a relaxed yet more formal dining room with big tables. Big screen TVs are all over the place with every sports show imaginable running. Service is attentive but not overbearing. Beer selection is good with a number of popular standards and some Arizona craft beers as well.   The menu is extensive and builds on the pub food theme but without trying to be "cute" or bizarre, two all too common traits in Scottsdale. Food is recognizable from description. They don't give things freaky names. Menu descriptions tell you what you're going to get.   Okay, order the onion rings. They're just great. They are crisp but cooked, lightly battered and FRESH, not out of a box. They a little spicy and that was fun. The platter is pretty big for $5.99 and all that the three of us could put away.   Because it had been forever for all of us, each ordered the Monte Cristo which is a featured menu item. It arrived in neatly arranged quarters with fries (other options are available) and a side of raspberry jam. Let's just say, this sandwich rocked and if it's any indication of what the rest of the menu is like, this place is a keeper. The sandwich was stuffed with meat and cheese, then properly battered and deep fried before being cut and plated. It wasn't just thrown on the grill. It was properly fried. Yummy. Again, not something to eat every day but an old favorite that was fun to meet again.   Our server was cheerful, efficient and attentive (thanks, Hannah) and added a lot to our experience. I'm holding off on a fifth star until I've tried some other things on the menu, but I will be back.   The only down-side was the hostess who seemed fried from the heat, but aren't we all in August? We were in for a late lunch so perhaps she just needed a break. Nothing wrong at all, just not the bouncy, happy greeting we were perhaps expecting. I can overlook this easily. I lose my zip on a 108-degree day too.

The concept behind Five Guys takes fast food to a new level. I call it "Premium Fast Food". After all, plan on paying about a 40% premium over the scarf and barf places that are on every corner. But there is a reason to pay more. Five Guys is labor-intensive. They employ actual people who are friendly, fun, dedicated and efficient. Where the Arcadia store finds these people is a mystery but I'm glad they do.   The menu is very simple. They sell burgers with one veggie and one cheese sandwich option and a hot dog. That's the menu. When they say "Burgers and Fries", they mean it. Instead of a smashed mess with a quarter-inch thick piece of mystery meat in it, Five Guys delivers quality meat, hand formed patties, hand assembled while you watch and a real human touch with others lack. But I can eat and enjoy a Bacon Cheeseburger there and be stuffed, not wondering what is going to get me through the rest of the day. It's darn tasty, too and worth the drive out of my way.   Also, if you want to delve into the health aspect, this is much healthier fast food in terms of fat, calories from fat, sodium, etc. The customer is in charge of what goes on the burger, too. Want to cut the sodium, order without the bacon. Simple choices.   I also love the Coca-Cola machines which are self-serve. They offer a myriad of soft drinks you can't buy in stores like Lime Coke and Raspberry Coke. Mmmm.

I am updating my review and taking Five Guys down to one star after my most recent visit. I found that they had raised prices yet again and had reduced portion sizes. Few things anger me more as a consumer than this double hit in the wallet. Burgers appear to be smaller but the fries are noticeably smaller. The cups they use to hold the fries are about one third smaller and the "extra" fries they toss in have been cut by half. For the burger, fries and drink I had, the bill was just under $18. I can go to a sports bar I like in Scottsdale and have a selection of sandwiches with plentiful fries, a bottomless soft drink and with tip get out of there for less than my Five Guys bill AND have someone serve it to me on a plate. Raise prices OR shrink portion but don't do both. This tactic offends me and my wallet and I doubt if I will be back.

They have parking, it's clean, it's convenient. Those are the good points. It's loud and I could not hear. I didn't know the drill of negotiating the counter which looks organized but isn't. One person's order will take longer and they tell people to "jump ahead" to move on down the line. The menu is scattered overhead in the most illogical manner so one's head has to bounce back and forth.   I went with two others who had been there before but they also seemed confused. "I want soup". Oh, down there. "I want salad." Back up the queue. Then as we were paying together one in our party told the cashier, "This is all together" and got a glare like that of a prison guard as she walked away with another in our party waving the yellow "pre-check" at her.   The ordering process was so noisy and confusing that I forgot to get anything to drink. I finally settled on water at the self-serve fountain so I would not have to go back to the prison guard and try to jump the queue to buy a drink. I ordered a Club sandwich which the online menu touted in real estate puffery as sounding great and big. It was neither. It was average. The croissant was just ok. Not flaky and not buttery but just a piece of bread. The menu lists this as having "applewood smoked bacon...and  a dijon vinaigrette dressing". Both were conspicuously absent. No bacon. No "dressing". Turkey and ham were good as was the paper thin slice of tomato. That was it. The ingredients that were there were good but not enough of them for the price.   The sandwich came with a cookie (Costco's are better) and I needed it because of the disappointingly small sandwich. One in our party had a half a salad and half a sandwich for $10. Not the best deal. Not exactly gougy but not a deal, either. For lunch, one can go to a proper, sit-down restaurant for the same price or less.   The restaurant has outdoor seating on two sides, and a "conference" table for groups, jammed-together tables for two and booths for four. It's possible to spread out even at busy times, so that helps but the noise factor is just off the wall. If I got dragged back by friends I would go along but this would not be a place I would choose.

The Supercharger brought me in but now I'd stop here, regardless. This Carl's is well run, staffed by really friendly local people and really puts a good foot forward for a unique desert town which proudly lists its four digit population with "....and five old crabs" on the welcome sign. This place gets hit by locals all day and those passing through in herds but they keep up with the flow and always offer a cool place to relax and fresh, made to order food. This is a true desert oasis where one can cool off with a big, cold drink and get first rate fast food served with a smile. Yeah, the smile is important and you get it here.

This is as good as it gets. The opportunity to look at a great car and ask questions and then get good, factual answers is a new experience. The traditional "car lot" is full of vultures who don't really know much but are great with the buzz phrases. None of that here. The Tesla store is friendly relaxed and thoroughly professional. They arranged a test drive for me which was also a breath of fresh air. Just the facts and none of the usual pressure. I was so impressed by the car AND the Tesla people that I ordered a car four days after my test drive.

After having been dragged to his restaurant in Carefree with the freakish menu of bizarre food which the Coen Brothers on a good day could not dream up, I was really skeptical of Bink's Midtown. I must say that Binkley is starting to read his market or perhaps sees that the new is starting to wear off his "fine dining" concept. Here, he seems to be trying to get it right. There are enough freakish things on the menu such as roasted marrow bone (gag!) and he's big on mussels. This is Arizona. I've had mussels out of the water in Nova Scotia and this is just too far away. I want to keep on living. No thanks.  Those items aside, Bink's is making a stab at reasonable prices and food that is creative yet non-freakish and non-threatening. He can keep the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. That's not food. That's what food eats.   Bink's hits the need for lunch and happy hour and in these areas he does pretty well. Portions are small as at any Bink's place but decent. He makes a good but not a great burger. Salads are really, really fresh with good accompaniments and dressings. The happy hour menu is very reasonable and can serve as a sufficient early dinner. His express lunch concept is to offer two broad categories with three selections within each and he promises you will be in and out in 30 minutes and he delivers on this. Express Lunch is $15 and you're done. Still kind of an expensive fast lunch but not bad to treat one's self.   I still think he has a long way to go in order to leave behind the freaky menu of his anchor restaurant in Carefree but he is making a gallant effort to offer food that people have heard of without being strange just for the sake of being strange or avoiding comparison with other restaurants. This will never be a favorite of mine but I am glad I let myself be dragged there to see that Binkley is at least trying to accommodate the local market and not just well-heeled snowbirds who apparently will eat anything at any price.

I was dragged here by friends who were eager to try the latest cookie cutter bar in the Scottsdale "Entertainment District". Face it with 100 bars, it's hard to differentiate. The decor is trying to recapture the romance, earthiness and dirt of Reata Pass, Pinnacle Peak Patio and Greasewood Flat with the addition of big screens to distract the patrons from what they are eating.   The menu is totally uninspired and unimpressive. It's the same bar food I can get anywhere, heavy on the unhealthy choices. Ever wonder why I don't order appetizers in Scottsdale? It's because they are lame, small and priced like full dinners. When I see a $12 appetizer on a menu of a "bar", I start to become suspicious.   Burgers and fish and chips with a $16 flat iron steak. This whole menu is one big cliché! I know burgers have replaced fine dining in the Phoenix Metro area, but it's just too much. Can't anyone be bold enough to resurrect the Monte Cristo sandwich? How about a good club? We're not talking rocket science. Here, everything is heavy and greasy to compliment the hickish overtones of the trappings such as the use of the word "Redneck" on the menu. Trust me, the trendy herd swarming downtown Scottsdale may want to watch rednecks in their natural habitat on TV but they in no way identify as rednecks.   Let me cut to the chase. This place is like Dierks Bentley's music. It's one gimmick after another, strung together in the hope that nobody will notice. Seriously, listen to one of his songs. They are one musical "hook" after another, repeated until a crooning, slow finish is inserted. The bar is pretty much that way too. Lame food and gimmicks such as bottle service or a table that has its own beer tap are "firsts" so they say. Well, there's probably a reason for that.

A Tesla does not need much service but when it needs some attention, it needs a highly trained, highly motivated team of professional experts. Not to fret oh Phoenix Metro. The Tesla Service Center in North Scottsdale sets the bar so high when it comes to professionalism, friendliness and just plain human decency that there is no comparison with other service facilities, especially those "dealer" places.   The Tesla experience is a fine one. Okay, THE finest. Nothing can compare and this extends to the Service Center as well. They are great people who pay attention to the smallest details and will take the time to answer questions about the car and its ultra high-tech systems.   Superlatives fall way short in expressing just how good of an experience it is to bring a Model S to these fine people.   My annual service was thoroughly professional. Systems were updated and upgraded. They checked tire tread depth at three points on each tire and recorded it for the final printout. They topped up fluids and did an alignment check. he car was ready hours before they said it would be so I could pick it up at lunchtime. Oh yeah, a comprehensive annual service for less than what Toyota charges for an alignment and in half the time. Not bad.   My "big" service issue was a slight squeak in the driver's seat. I called them on a Saturday afternoon to ask if there was anything I could do about it. They said, "Can you bring it in?" Sure! I was only 8 miles away. They checked it out and said, "Give us five minutes". It took them three minutes and I was on my way.   My previous car service experience was with a chamber of horrors called Riverview Toyota. I knew I was being treated like garbage by them but moving up to a Tesla and their totally, freakin' awesome factory service made me think of an old joke: The best thing about hitting yourself repeatedly in the head with a brick is that it feels so good when you stop."   The Service Center alone is a good enough reason to own a Tesla. I enjoy being treated like royalty and forgetting about past experiences elsewhere. This is the only way to go.

As a Native American, Frybread is soul food. Its ingredients are simple but it is so, SO easy to wreck it and have something more suited to shingle a roof than to eat. Believe me, I have had my own Frybread disasters. That's why a place that totally gets it right is such a great find and Maria's gets top marks across the board for their Frybread and everything they put on it.   Once you have had a Frybread tostada or Frybread Navajo Taco, you will wonder why you ever settled for a tortilla. It's bread, but crisp on the outside, soft on the inside and Maria's will top or fill it in very creative ways with top quality goodies. The Frybread with carne asada is the stuff dreams are made of. It starts with perfect Frybread then they tiny-cubed carne asada which is cooked and trimmed perfectly. They pile on beans, lettuce, tomatoes and cheese. I think my knife and fork were making sparks as I ate it. You literally can't get anything this good unless you go to Kayenta or Window Rock and they'll come up short on the carne asada up there, but if you like mutton, hey!   Maria's is a small place with only six indoor tables and two larger outdoor tables (wait until it cools off for that) but they also do a brisk takeaway business, so call ahead or just show up and order something to take home. Service is fast. Really fast. The Flash fast.   If you are new to Frybread and want to experience it in its glorious simplicity, stop in and order a plain piece of Frybread. They will provide cinnamon sugar, powdered sugar and honey. The Frybread will come out hot - really hot. While it's hot, dust on cinnamon sugar, then powdered sugar, then more cinnamon sugar. The heat will cause it to fuse and stick. Drizzle on some honey and just tear off a piece and make all gone. If you like sopapillas, this is a sopapilla straight out of heaven which you will never forget. It's a perfect dessert or snack. Then...imagine what it's like topped with Mexican ingredients and you have Maria's place. Sweet or savory, they've got it right.   Prices are very reasonable, service is fast, the place is antiseptically clean and the people are so friendly that you'll wonder what's wrong with them.
