Couldn't be more pleased with how my hair turned out. Jen did such a great job, listened to what I wanted, and works so fast. I will definitely be returning!

I lived here for almost a year and miss it already! We relocated to a house after changing jobs, but we couldn't have picked a better community to live in. All of the staff are so wonderful, friendly and helpful. The grounds and pool are kept clean thanks to the maintenance team, and it feels like you're living in a quiet little neighborhood with how the property is laid out. We never had one issue with noise or maintenance, and if you're reading this just stop looking now cause you've found your home! I would live here again in a heartbeat.

The location in downtown Phoenix is great, I go there often when I'm in the area. Today I walked into this north Phoenix location and I was the only one inside, yet it took 5 minutes to be seated as there was no staff to be seen. The woman walked in on the phone and was the phone the whole time I was there, even while taking my order, proceeding to talk to them as I'm ordering. Silverware is dirty, but the food is good. They should just invest their time and money into one location if they can't keep the service consistent.
