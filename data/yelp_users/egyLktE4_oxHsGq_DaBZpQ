The inside looked much better than the outside.  It has a nice quaint setup, but they need some work on atmosphere.  AC was a bit cold and the lighting was very dim.  The food was fine, but the wait is very long.  They told us everything was made from scratch, but I think that is code for "expect a long wait."  Price is high and I left still hungry.  My vote, look elsewhere for Thai food.

The first time I walked in I was greeted by a cute door chime that said hello in Korean.  Inside it has the nice look of a Korean village.  Food is delicious, and I am always a fan of the side dishes.  Korean food tends to be on the more expensive side, but those little side dishes are great and the service was great here too.  If you are a white boy like me, they will automatically serve you regular water.  So, if you want a more authentic experience, ask for the barley tea that is customary for Koreans.  They will also explain how to eat Korean food, if you have never eaten bibim bap and start eating it as is!  :)   The last time I was here service was great, but other times we had to go get the server.  Don't be shy, there isn't many people working here. Don't mind the outside area, definitely come eat here!
