We made a reservation for my pregnant best friend's 25th birthday today for a table of 14. (Keep in mind, she's already emotional to begin with). We get here at 7PM sharp and wait to be seated... The host then checks his reservation book and says we don't have a reservation set up. I ask him to look again because I made the reservation myself this morning and got a confirmation from the employee. After arguing back and forth for about 3 minutes, He checks again and then sees the reservation however it isn't made until tomorrow... We then ask wen the next table will be ready and we are told it's gonna take one hour to get the table ready...  Oh yeah, and it's MONDAY! So I ask to speak to a manager because why should we wait one hour! Isn't that the whole point of a reservation! We shouldn't be punished for somebody else's incompetent mistake !

Never disappointed when I visit this shop. Clean, friendly establishment. The owner and other barbers ALWAYS greet me, as well as everyone else who walks through those doors. The longest I've ever waited is 45 minutes (but it was a very busy time of day). All the guys are very efficient and give great cuts and have everyone out in a timely manner. Pedro is usually the barber I go to. Very funny guy and makes every visit enjoyable. His attention to detail is appreciated and he ensures I get exactly what I ask for. There are so many other shops closer to me but I don't mind driving out of my way to come here.
