MMM Chicos. I have been coming here for years and it has consistantly been delicious. It is one of the places we bring out of town guests to.  This is a pay-at-the-counter type place, but much much better than any type of ____bertos.   They have lard free beans and a salsa bar with several different types and they give you chips to munch on before your meal.  The portions are extremely generous, especially if you get the california burro. I weighed it and it was literally a pound.  The tostadas come in a shell, and are kind of a mix between a tostada and a taco salad, but the veggie tostada is my favorite. get the guac and sour cream and you have the best mexican food around.  The California burro and the quesedillas are also really good. My boyfriends mom will drive from Apache Junction just to get the steak quesedilla.  The restaurant is brightly colored and has upbeat mexican music playing. Good location with lots of parking, and its right next to a Starbucks.  And if my review wasnt enough to convince you, I can almost guarantee that you will see cops eating there if you go. I think that says something :)  PS I think they are closed on Sundays

This is by far my favorite restaurant ever.  I have been coming to Fate for about five years now and never ONCE have I been disappointed with the food or the atmosphere. We are normally pretty lucky and we get Heather who is SUPER sweet and a great waitress. I see reviews about people complaining about the hostess. Yeah, they can be snobby and make life difficult but it is SO worth it.  I would 100% recommend the hot and sour soup. It is amazing. Unfortunately I recently found out it has SHRIMP POWDER so I cannot eat it any more. Another tasty veggie friendly appetizer is the tofu wedges. They come with an amazing peanut sauce.  I have had several entrees, but always come back to the Hong Kong Flat Rice with fried tofu. It is so amazing. Garlicy sauce. They have really amazing yellow curry too. They might put brown sugar in it because it is a little sweet, but perfectly so.  The portions are always great, and you honestly CANNOT beat the atmosphere. It is an old house in the historic district turned restaurant and they display artwork from local artists.   Stay away during artwalk though, or you will have to wait forever for a table. They are open really late on the weekends too.  At least give Fate a shot once. If you don't like it I will let you punch me in the gut.

My love affair with Fate ended when Johnny left.   The service, quality and atmosphere took a total nose dive.  Go to Sens instead.

I'm pissed. How can you just stop making grilled cheese? Its bread and cheese. HOW? You have bread, and you have cheese, but you cannot make a grilled cheese?  Also, why does it have to be 400 degrees? I know you have A.C. This is AZ in the summer. It's hot. Turn it on.  I don't have a really good basis to draw this conclusion because I rarely order this drink, but your dirty vodka martini is quite possibly the worst I have ever tasted. I had to eat a cheese stick with each bite just to stomach it.  Your tater tots were good and my blue moon was reasonably priced. At least you have that going for you.

I had the pleasure of spending my Friendaversary with the lovely Georgie S. this past Sunday at the Opera. Because we saw "La Boheme" I felt it only right to get Italian food, so we headed over to The Old Spaghetti Factory in hopes of satisfying our pasta craving.  It was quite charming when our waiter came over with the bottle of wine that we ordered. It was the second most pricey bottle they sold (coming in at $34) and he told us in the four years he worked there he had never sold a bottle that expensive. Well, that's because you don't have high class broads like us patronizing this establishment, or so it would seem!  They have a good sized menu with a lot of delicious looking dishes. I was especially excited that they have gluten-free pasta! I was hoping I would be able to eat more than a salad. On that note, I must point out that your meal comes with salad, bread, your entree, and iced tea, AND spumoni for dessert! If you choose not to get the tea and dessert, you get to knock $1.50 off the cost of your meal.   That means that my large, tasty plate of pasta and the salad cost me $6.50.That's right folks, dinner for $6.50!  The place itself is pretty charming. They have a trolley car in the middle you can sit in. The one drawback is that this place is very "family" oriented; something Miss G and I are not normally very "fond" of. But we dealt.   Very solid 4 stars....

When someone says "Lets get Mexican for breakfast... there is this place on 12th street and Van Buren...." my stomach takes a dive and common sense tells me that it's probably not a very good idea, but I was in an adventurous mood and Dallas G. is normally always spot on with his restaurant choices, so I decided to give it a whirl.   Um... hell yeah! La Tolteca was awesome! Any place that has a full on Mexican bakery staring you in the face when you walk in is fine by me! I was lovingly admiring the watermelon shaped cookies from afar. I will be back... my stomach said.   We got up to the menu board and I was impressed with the huge selection of items they had to offer. Honestly, if you cant find something that gets the juices flowing here, you have some seriously demented taste buds.   I opted for the egg and cheese burrito with pico and a side of beans and rice. I slathered on the green sauce from the salsa bar and munched away at the deliciousness as the sweat poured down my face. This was one spicy, but tasty, breakfast!   D.G. got the huevos rancheros. I didn't try them, but they looked pretty damn good and he seemed to be enjoying them. He also opted for the horchatta, which I normally don't like, but was pleasantly surprised with.   Another thing I really want to point out is that the people that work here are REALLY nice, even to us whities. Normally I do not get such a welcome reception, but honestly, the workers were dancing and singing to the festive tunes and even the lady at the pick up counter had a smile on her face.   I planned on hitting up the bakery for that watermelon cookie, but my $6 breakfast burro, rice and beans had me FULL... so I will be back for you my little cookie.. yes... I will be back!!!

If I ever got the urge to become a stripper, I would get a job at Bandaids. As Dottsy so eloquently explained, these are your average, run-of-the-mill girls you would find working in your neighborhood. I can't compete with the likes of Candy and Barbie at the Scottsdale clubs, but I may be able to hold a candle to girls of Bandaids.  While I must admit I have less of an imagination than Dottsy (I don't find myself wondering what people would look like if they stripped. Often.) I recognize and appreciate this establishment for what it is.   I had my power hour here back in the day when the hooch stopped pouring at 1am. This is really very irrelevant to my review, but at the same time, seems wrong to omit.   I kind of feel like they used the remnants of someones drink for my vodka tonic this past Saturday, which is unfortunate because I paid $8, but the $6 Corona served me well and I was not horribly chapped by the high cost considering this is a strip club.  As a woman, I don't have to pay a cover charge. That means that I can walk in and look at boobies for free. Wait, why am I not giving this place 5 stars???    Really what more do I need to say?

For the location of this bar, I honestly do not think it is that bad. It is certainly not a happening Scottsdale bar, but I have been here twice and really enjoyed myself both times.  The bar is awesome for karaoke. They have a great selection of songs, and there are always plenty of people there to sing away. You have some good, some bad, just like any other place. Both times I went were on a Saturday and everyone in my party had the chance to sing multiple times without a long wait.  The drinks are well priced and I have never had to wait that long.  They have a few pool tables and two electronic dart boards in addition to Karaoke.  I thought the point of Yelp was to review things for what they are. If this bar was in Scottsdale, it would be a different story, but its at 48th Street and McDowell and its a Dive Bar. As far as dive bars go... it is definitely a 4 in  my books.

Normally I love Del Taco, so I figured I would try out their breakfast burrito before a road trip up north. Bad call.  First of all, I had to repeat my order three times. Breakfast burrito meal with coffee. Not a tough one, and no special order.  When I get up to the window, the guy tells me they are out of hot coffee. WHA? It's 9am. However, he said they can give me an iced vanilla coffee instead. Sure, fine, whatever.  I hand over my debit card and what do you know, they are charging me to use it. Great. I am now paying 23% more because they are cheap-scates.  I get my bag of food and pull away, only to find out that I didn't get the meal.. I got a coffee and the burrito, but no hash brown sticks. BOO! Well, I am certainly not going back to try and explain myself, especially since I already scraped my tire trying to get closer to the window that is 5 feet away from the curb.  Oh, and to top it all off, the burrito and the coffee were gross.  No way, jose.

Canton Wong 3 has the best delivery Chinese food I have ever had.  I have had the family bean curd, ma po tofu, egg fried rice, veggie chow mein and the veggie egg rolls.  They have never messed up my order, normally take about 45 minutes, and the drivers are always nice.  They take CC over the phone and they ask for your ID when you get there to make sure its your card. Good fraud protection :)  They leave you with coupons, and the food is already reasonably priced.  Only complaint is they are closed Monday and I think they close at 9, so if I want late night eats I have to go somewhere else.

The mozarella sandwich is amazing.  They have a very limited menu, but once you try the food, you will eat there regularly.  All outdoor seating, and they have limited hours, so make sure you check the hours before you head out there.

I have heard sooooooo much about this place and finally I had the occasion to go.  The place is actually pretty cool looking and not as dingy as I thought it would be. What I did not expect was the type of people there. It was quite a variety.. I expected it to be more on the alternative side.  Major dislikes would include not-so-clean bathrooms, and a fight broke out in the pool table area. I can't remember the last time I was around a barroom brawl.  The food is pretty good and really reasonably priced. They have a really good drink menu including a huge selection of rare beers. I got a chopped salad, but beware, it is not actually chopped...  The service left a little to be desired, but wasn't bad. There were only two waitresses for the whole bar on a Saturday, so that could have something to do with it.  Overall this place is pretty cool, great selection and really reasonable prices. I'll be back.

Dude. Pomeroy's is the shit.   Charlie, the bartender, is quite possibly the best bartender in the world. He asked every single person's name and actually remembered it, even though I am certain he was half cocked.   The food was surprisingly tasty. (Grilled Cheese. YUMMMM)   I got completely obliterated off of two drinks: a Jagger Bomber and a Fat Tire. They might lace their glasses with roofies.   I love any place with an Internet juke box. They also had darts, pool and shuffleboard.   The best part? OMG the people watching. Saturday night is the weekly white trash symposium. I'm going to become a card holding member just so I can make this place a weekly.   I really wish Yelp had half stars because for a dive bar, this is 4.5

I walked in, screamed "Hey Charlie" to Charlie, the bartender, and he screamed back "Hey Amber."  This is my new home base.   I couldn't love this place more if I tried.  Try the fuzzy .... ummm .. you know, the other name for a kitty kat ... it's quite tasty

When I get excited, I squeal like the little child that I am. Another childlike quality I posses is the overwhelming love and affection for pizza, so you can only imagine the complete and utter detestation that I felt when I learned I had food allergies to gluten, eggs, and dairy.   My poor little baby heart just broke. That is, until I learned that Pizza Heaven, appropriately named, was placed on this planet, in this very city, right down the road from my home, just for people like me.   Gluten Free Dough. Vegan Cheese. Abundant Toppings. Yeah - I squealed. I ate the shit out of that pizza. I even loved it on day two. And day three. And if Pizza Heaven doesn't watch out, I'm going to be back again every night for the next week.   The place is uber cute. The staff is friendly. The location is great. The parking is accommodating. They have "regular" food (pizza, subs, pasta, etc). And they serve booze.   Thank you for catering to us pain-in-the-ass children that were put on the planet to make everyone's life difficult!

This is really a 4.5 from me.   I have been to several of the Arriba's and have never had bad service or any problems with my food. (I have been to the locations on Camelback, at Arrowhead Mall and off the 101 in N. Scottsdale)  They bring out chips, salsa and bean dip and it tastes absolutely amazing. The chips are always fresh and they have great salsa. They just keep refilling and refilling them, so my only complaint is that I get too full and cannot eat all of my food!  Jamie M. mentioned having trouble finding a vegetarian option there, but I have not had a problem. I normally get the bean and cheese burro topped with queso dip. I have also had the abado pizza with beans vs. beef the taco salad sans beef and the cheese quesedilla. I would eat any one of those items again.   The red and green sauce are not veggie friendly, but you can easily top your meal with the salsa or their queso dip, just ask for no chorizo on it.  The margaritas are really amazing too, and HUGE! I think you pay $11 but they are big enough for 2-3 people to share. The cost of the food is reasonable.  The restaurant itself is pretty fun. They have a cool mexican/sonoran theme throughout and everything is bright and colorful.   It's one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the valley.

I'm seriously shocked that there are not more neg reviews on here about this place because I hear people bitching all the time.   First of all, do not expect to make a quick 'in-and-out' experience. You walk in and put your name on the List.. yes, list with a capital L. What is interesting is they ask you what your question/comment/concern is but when you finally get called five hours later, they ask you to explain your question/comment/concern all over again.  Let's just say you have a Blackberry Pearl 8130 and the roller ball does not work anymore. Hypothetically, of course. So the highly skilled guy behind the counter looks at it for 2 seconds and says "Oh, looks like it needs to be replaced..." I'm pretty sure I already said that. "Unfortunately, we don't have any of these in stock.."  Wha? Come again? You don't have any more of one of your most popular phones in stock, in any of the 542 colors it comes in? Boy oh Boy.  "Here, you can call this number and request they send you out a new one." Great, the same number that told me I had to go into the store to get it replaced.  Oh brother what a bummer.

Zen32 is my favorite place to get Sushi. I have been here at least a dozen times over the years and have never had an unfavorable experience.   I am not the best sushi critic being that I am vegetarian, but I think they have pretty good veggie rolls and edamame :)   I mostly enjoy the atmosphere and the drinks here. It's a great location, there are chicks running around in little kimono's (I think that is what they are called...), you can sit on the patio and overall the place makes me feel cool and that is really all that matters to me in life.  oooo I forgot about that little cucumber salad too...yumm!

I really like Hava Java! They have a great location (32nd and Camelback) and are located right next to The Gelato Spot, which has amazing Gelato. They actually share a common wall.  Hava Java itself is pretty small inside, but there is outdoor seating in the front and in the back.   They make really good coffee's. I especially enjoy their vanilla latte. I think they have a punch-card system and they have very reasonable prices, as well.   Only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because they have a surcharge for you to use your credit/debit card and I know that is against Visa and MasterCard regulations.

I recently got my little baby pug Penny from a private breeder, so I wanted to take her to a vet and get her checked out. Animal Care Hospital was close to my house, so I figured I would give it a try.   They were able to see me SAME DAY, which was an awesome treat. I was afraid I would have to wait several days for my new puppy exam and the medical guarantee from the breeder was only good for one week.  Anyways, the vets office was conveniently located, the office is clean, the staff is friendly and everyone was in love with Penny. (it's hard not to be.. I know I am a proud mommy, but she really is adorable!)  I sat down and filled out my paperwork and they took me back right away. The vet, Dr. Temple, was extremely friendly and thorough and answered all my questions. I signed up for the "puppy package" that basically takes you through all of the shots they need for the first few months, wellness exams, fecal test and a microchip and also includes a start up of heartworm preventer.  Penny had her second set of shots the day prior when I purchased her from the breeder, but for some reason Dr. Temple gave her another set. She told me there was nothing to worry about but they didn't charge me, so I think she may have made a mistake. Penny was fine and she told me that it would not cause any problems, but I'm glad that she didn't make a mistake on something life threatening. (This is the only reason I am not giving ACHS five stars.)  We went back three weeks later for our third set of shots and got in immediately. They were quick, friendly and efficient again and able to provide me with some suggestions on how to curb Miss Penny's biting habits.  The only issues I have encountered were with the billing. I think that the puppy package confuses the billing girls a little, because both times I went in they had to make adjustments. Not a big deal, they took care of everything and refunded the incorrect amount immediately, I just hope it doesn't keep happening.  Oh, another really cool feature is that your pet gets a login and you can keep track of service records through the vet. They have some cool features on the website where you can fill out forms for someone babysitting your pet and you can post pictures and put in information about the diet. I know I lose papers all the time, so its great to have all of Penny's records online where I can easily access them.  They have awesome hours... so I can get in after work, and the location is convenient for me. They also sell different types of food and hygiene supplies there, so you can pick up stuff for your animal should you need to.  I would definitely recommend this Vet's office to anyone. Knowledgeable and Friendly staff!

I always forget that I really like this Borders until after I make a random stop in. I was hanging out in the center park area of Biltmore Fashion Park enjoying some Mojo when I realized I had just finished reading this dope ass book and wanted to get another one to help me stay on the self-help tip.  They have a good sized Psychology section in addition to a huge Business/Management section. I always come out of here with at least a book or two. I always find stuff in the clearance section, as well.  The have the coffee shop upstairs filled with yummy treats so you can have a snack or grab a drink and read all afternoon.  Convenient location, good prices, relaxing atmosphere make for a pleasant experience.

Once I was afraid, I was petrified... But now that I am officially a home owner, Home Depot has become my best friend!!   I see some complaints about the helpfulness of the employees, but every time I have been to this location everyone is nice and helpful. I knew nothing about paint and the gentlemen working the paint counter helped explain the type of roller I would need for the bricks vs. drywall and also explained about primers.  I find the prices here to be pretty reasonable and they do price matching. I'm sure that is something every HD does, though.  I am also really pleased that they are open until 10pm during the week. I was watching HGTV last night and got the overwhelming desire to go to Home Depot, but it was after 8pm and I was afraid I missed my chance. NOPE! Thanks to the auto attendant I was pleasantly informed that I could come look at doors and grills and shower heads and flowers until 10pm!  I'm sure I will see you in a few days, HD!

I have eaten at the Veggie house several times. The food is good, but the service is normally pretty slow. Do not head here if you are in a rush.  I normally get sweet and sour pork. Pretty tasty dish. I have tried some other things, but did not particularly care for them.  This is predominantly Asian based, and pretty heavy dishes.

Since The Veggie House turned into Loving Hut, I have been twice, and am very delighted at some of the positive changes that have occurred.  The space itself is much lighter, and I feel more welcome by the staff. I also like that their food selection is WAY less greasy and has more of a focus on health.  I have tried the spicy cha cha twice (it is actually yam protein breaded to look like shrimp) and it is FANTASTIC. I have also had the raw salad, sweet and sour pork, fried rice, one of the noodle soups, and the stuffed tomatoes. All were good, but the stuffed tomatoes could have used a little more flavor. Great portion sizes.  They do not serve alcohol, but have some really fun concoctions to drink. Try the "Pink Lady" or the delightful "Sunny Forest."

I really love their sourdough bread. I get the veggie on sourdough and really love the taste.  Drive through line is a little long and sometimes the bread hurts the top of my mouth, but this is my favorite fast food place.  OH.. the pizza is great too! I always get cheese with jalapenos. The bread they use for the crust rules.   Indoor and outdoor seating. Staff does not speak English very well, but I have never had an issue with my order. Been there at least ten times.

It is REALLY hard to rate La Grande Orange because there are so many amazing things about it, but it is so hard to find parking.  Pros The food is really, really amazing They have an awesome selection of things you wont see day to day They have really tasty coffee drinks Indoor and Outdoor seating  Cons The parking is really really rough They are pricey You have to wait in some pretty long lines  Try the commuter with avacado. It's amazing. Also, they have excellent chai.. and their english muffins are TO DIE FOR.  If you live in the area and can walk there, you are set. I used to live a half mile away and would take a walk there for breakfast. The absolute best way to start your day, IMO.

I'm updating my review because I had the pizza for the first time...  OH MY  GOD ....  Generally I try and stay away from :hype: items, but their pizza is KILLER. Like, just the cheese... was AH-MAY-ZINGGGG!!!  Also, the iced tea is so freaking good. I love that they put oranges in it, and you can actually get the loose leaf tea they use while you are shopping!   On a Sunday evening, the place was busy but I was able to find parking and they were taking orders at three different counters, so it was much more efficient than usual :)

I have been going to Petsmart for all of my puppy needs lately but decided to give Petco a try since it is closer to my apartment. Aside from a few small things, I was pretty impressed.   Dislikes *You cannot take the carts outside. They have poles on them, so they cannot get through the door. If you are purchasing, say, a large box of puppy pee-pads or 50lbs of dog food, you might be in trouble *The store is not super clean *Not the best organizational setup I have seen *The prices were actually higher than Petsmart in some areas  Likes *Everyone was super friendly *They have a large section of homemade doggie treats that you can get by the pound. Penny loved the peanut butter treats *They sell a lot of higher end dog foods I have not found at Petsmart *They have a really large selection of doggie outfits *I found a really awesome dog carrying bag for FIVE BUCKS! *Lots of parking close to the entrance  Overall, good experience  :)

I have only been here twice, but really enjoyed myself both times. They have a great wine list and the bruschetta sampler is amazing.  They cafe itself is fantastic. Very open with a ton of natural light and is very spacious. Great place to meet up with an old friend or take a date. Great for conversation and the crowd is normally a little more upscale.

On my first visit to Simoniz I was given the best wash for the cheapest wash price. This is pretty much the only time being a chick has paid off for me in a financial way. Except that time I hooked in Vegas.   Unfortunately, each subsequent time I have gone I have paid full price. Bummmmer!   Good washes, good oil changes, reasonable prices, comfy waiting area.... I'll be back as soon as soon as my windshield is so dirty I can't see out if it anymore.

I stopped by Pride Cleaners on Saturday and dropped off two suits and two shirts. Ended up costing about $40 which is a little more than I am used to spending, but they did a really great job and my clothes were ready to go on time.  Open until 6pm on weekdays works for me.

I recently was craving Thai food and came across some pretty stunning reviews for Thai Lahna.   I must say... I was REALLY impressed!   My table started with the vegetarian hot and sour soup. Everyone really seemed to enjoy the flavors and the plethora of veggies. I love those little flaming soup bowls they use.   I ordered the yellow curry with tofu, mild/medium as my entree. That is generally my staple Thai item and it was REALLY good. Extremely flavorful and a great portion size.   The restaurant itself was pretty small and the bathroom scenario left a little to be desired, but I was certainly impressed with our quality of service. We split the bill four ways and added a cash to-go order. The poor girl handled our complicated check out very well.   I can't believe I lived within walking distance from Thai Lahna for over a year and missed out on such a delicious place!!

Last night I learned that I should have applied myself to ice skating at a young age. I am a naturally graceful and beautiful figure skater. I skated backwards, I did twirls and even executed a highly skilled jump, and I have not even been on a pair of skates for sixteen years.  The pro shop did not have gloves, but quickly after getting on the ice I realized that I wouldn't need them because I was going to spend my time upright versus laying on the ice like I had anticipating before realizing how highly skilled of a skater I am.   $8.25 (I think) paid my admission for two hours of skating and got me some sweet rental skates. I really wanted some graceful white ones, but I got brown. Fortunately I had leg warmers to complete my ensemble and tie everything together. Brown has never looked so good with sparkly gray tights before.   There were plenty of places to pop a squat to put on your skates or take a break and they have lockers to stash your shoes and hand bags. It also appears they have a snack bar and vending machines, but I did not partake in any of those offerings.   I did, however, partake in some libations at the Ice House, located at the east end of the rink. I love that my friends and acquaintances sat inside the bar sipping their bourbon watching us skaters from the comfort of their warm seats. I'm certain they were too intimidated by my amazing skating skills to join on the ice.  If you thought THAT was impressive, just you wait... I am going to take lessons and next time we have an ice skating #pfn I will blow all of you away with my triple quadruple axle spin jumps.

Never in my Yelp career have I started, saved, deleted and restarted a review more than I have this Bashas review. One would think "This is just a grocery store, why all the trouble?"  Bashas is more than just a grocery store; it is a facilitator. A facilitator of what we need as consumers to fuel our lives and contribute to our happy memories or to help us wash away the bad ones.   Bashas facilitated the best Champagne Sunday that ever existed. It has provided the chlorine that I so desperately needed so many times to keep my pool from going green. Here I found the curry paste that started my affinity for cooking. The cake that ended up all over my living room at my sister's 21st birthday? That's right: Bashas.  So many events and critical moments in our lives revolve around the tangible items we spend our hard earned cash on and we don't even realize it. We may complain about how long we have to stand in line or the fact that Bashas may be a tad more expensive than some other grocery stores, but we cannot deny that we need this Bashas.   I need you, Bashas.

I wanted to take my sister out for dinner last night to celebrate her upcoming 21st birthday prior to going to see Cirque Du Soliel. We both love Mexican food and Carlos O'Brien's is literally within walking distance from my house. We used to go all the time as kids, but it has been years since I have been there last.   I'm glad we gave it a try because we had a really great experience. We were seated immediately even though it was 5:45pm. We had friendly, attentive service from both our busser and our server.  We were served delicious, warm tortilla chips shortly after sitting with a tasty, fresh, and chunky salsa. They also provided the liquefied hot sauce, but I did not eat it because I do not like that kind at any restaurant.  I decided on the veggie fajitas. The black beans are vegetarian, the refrieds are not. My sister selected the fajita quesedilla, sans meat.  Our food arrived quickly and piping hot. Both of us had huge portion sizes and the food was extremely fresh and really tasty. They put a salty and slightly spicy seasoning on their fajitas, which come with a mixture of peppers, onions, squash, zucchini and potatoes.   Back in the day when I used to eat meat (15+ years ago) I always ordered the shredded beef chimi. It was amazing. I would assume that it retains the same amazing taste and size as when I favored it as a child, but who knows.  Our meal came to $21 and I gladly tipped our server over 20%! I will definitely be back when I have a cheat day on my diet!!

This place is dive-bar personified, but I can see it becoming a place I will hang out at now that most of my friends have finally figured out that they have a better time when I am not around.   4K is filled with all the potential in the world for a good time. Darts, pool tables, hot babe nudie video photo-seek machines, an internet jukebox and multiple large screen TV's. They have cheep drinks, Ladies Night and potato chips.  Sure the bar was empty except for me, the ex-husband and a guy named John for more than half the time we were there, but just as we were leaving the local regulars started showing up and you could tell that this is the type of place that good people that lost their way go to die. Exactly the type of place I would fit in. The Ex too.   Tanya, our bartender, was lovely and recommended the bubblegum vodka with Red Bull. She provided the option for both regular and sugar free Red Bull. Just for that alone I am bumping this place up to four stars.   Sure the bathrooms are small and the carpet is about a hundred years old, but who cares about that when you have your Blue Moon with an orange slice sitting next to you while you are playing nudie photo seek and James Hetfield is singing about war? Not this girl.

I have been to Wendy's Nails 3 times now and have been very pleased with all my services. Last time I brought 2 friends along for pre-brunch manicures and we were all very happy.   The salon is clean, friendly, and they provide great service and have many regulars. My only complaint is their price is a little higher than comparable nail salons ($15 manicure).

Based on all of the positive reviews I read here on Yelp, I wanted to give Salon Surreal a try. I'm glad I did because I had a positive experience and I will be back.  I called in to try and make an appointment with Bobby because he had the most positive reviews. Unfortunately, we had conflicting schedules for three weeks straight and I couldn't wait that long. I decided to go with Brandy because the receptionist said she was good with bangs.   The salon itself is pretty cool and really big. There are a ton of stylists and it looks like it caters to medium to upscale clients, but like other people mentioned before, it was very comfortable and unpretentious.  They have separate areas for cuts, dryers and the sinks, so I got the opportunity to see the entire salon. I was pretty impressed. They have flexible hours, which is great because I work until 4pm, and a huge variety of products.  My color came out great and even though this is a new salon, the color matched perfectly with my old salon and my cut came out great. Brandy actually did a better job than my old stylist who I had been seeing for almost two years! She was extremely friendly and had great chair talk. She gave me exactly what I asked for and I was comfortable the entire time.  I would definitely recommend this salon  :) I would say it is a TAD overpriced but its not awful, and they fully disclose the prices on the website, on a product card and before your service, so you are well aware.

I went back for a bang trim because it was really an emergency. I got a same day appt. for 5pm with my regular. I was excited when I walked in because she was waiting for me (I was 15 mins early) and she remembered who I was, which is great customer service.  As usual, Brandy was very friendly and we discussed plans for the weekend. I also made mention that my hair was NOT black as I wanted, and she told me to just tell the receptionist next time I book a color appt. that I need black and they will special order. ALRIGHT!  From the time I left my car to the time I got back in, was a total of 9 minutes.. which was pretty cool. And the trim was free. Cant beat that.

Best.Bowling.Ever. Well... not by me. I bowled terribly, but I pretty much had the best time ever doing it!  $11.85 for all you can bowl for four hours plus shoes on a Friday night?!? Bargain! $2 beers (Bud Light). I don't drink that piss water but everyone else seemed happy.   Kick ass DJ rockin Van Halen, Michael J, Phil Collins and The Temptations!? Chickity Check!  Quite possibly the biggest parking lot in the world. I doubt it has ever been filled up.  The bartender was slower than the second coming... literally. I must have missed two round of bowling waiting for my drop top. This is the only reason I am giving it four stars and not five.  SO, yeah... I have my own shoes and ball. I'm a geek, nerd, dork, whatever. Unfortunately the sole of one of my shoes broke off in transit so I had to borrow some from the alley. They were pretty dope. I actually considered leaving the one shoe they take in collateral so I could take those awesome bowling shoes home!!  All I really have left to say is that this is the best bowling alley I have ever been to!

I'm a gluten-free vegan; can my life get any worse?  I kid. It's a conscious choice. Well, mostly. You see, I have this terrible thing called "food allergies." Among my allergies, gluten, egg whites, and casein (found in all dairy products). Being that I am a vegetarian, it is only logical for me to make the step to becoming vegan unless I want a lifetime of stomach aches and respiratory hell.    I have always come to Whole Foods for their wide variety of vegetarian options and the awesome salad bar, but now that I have found they have a section devoted to gluten free living and have a plethora of vegan options, I am absolutely in love.  This lifestyle certainly isn't what one would call fun, but fortunately there are places like Whole Foods that help make my life just a little bit easier and cater to people with discriminating tastes or high maintenance eating requirements.   Five Stars!

Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind ... Memories, sweetened thru the ages just like wine...  Oh the memories this Uncle Sam's has for me. My entire extended family used to use this as our impromptu reunion spot when I was a wee child.  We still meet up here on occasion for nostalgia's sake.  My two female cousins used to torture me and I would end up in the bathroom crying every single time. That is until I called my cousin a hooker. Nobody knew what it meant, but it stopped their constant berating so it did the trick.  I cannot imagine a better happy hour. Pitchers of premium beer are $2.99 and their food is like $3. You can get a bud light on draft for $0.75 if you are into that sort of thing.  I always get the cheese hoagie (Cold) with the sweet peppers. Delish. Everything here is good, though, including the pizza, fries, and mozzarella sticks.   The only reason they don't get a five is because they have horrific service. Sorry, it's true.  Come. Enjoy. Watch Football. Play the Vintage Pacmen Game. Just don't let your cousins torture you for five years.. just call them a hooker from the get go. Trust me, it works.

This book store is absolutely amazing. Literally all of their books are half priced, but that doesn't mean they are the sucky type of books you find in the clearance section of Borders.   They do have an awesome $1 clearance section with a shit load of awesome books. If you are a Dean Koontz fan, you will be in Koontz heaven.

I always forget about Half Price Books until I am in the area... today was no exception. I was on my way to Barnes and Noble or Borders (whatever is across the street) when I remembered about Half Price!  They did not have the book I was looking for (Skinny Bitch) but I did pick up five other books relevant to what I was looking for and my total was $4.98. Yes, that is right, I got FIVE BOOKS for FIVE DOLLARS. With tax!  They have an excellent selection, excellent prices, the store is very clean and organized and overall a fantastic book store!

I wish that I could give The Melting Pot more than 5 stars because they made our company holiday party stress free and absolutely perfect!!  I have put together a number of company parties and they are always stressful and something horrific normally goes on. Tracy (rest manager) made the entire process a breeze, from start to finish. She even let me taste test the wines we were serving. That was a fun afternoon ;-)  The food was amazing, as usual, and the service was outstanding. I would highly recommend the spinach artichoke cheese fondue and the yin and yang chocolate fondue! Amazing!!!!  I would highly recommend The Melting Pot to anyone looking to host a holiday party or really any type of party for that matter. It is also a really intimate and romantic place to take someone on a date.

I recently met with the lovely Georgie S. for lunch at good ol Los Taquitos. I am absolutely certain that I gained no less than seven pounds in this sitting between the bean & cheese with Pico De Gallo burrito and the Chile Relleno.   Yeah, that is right, I ordered and ate two full meals.   What can I say; I like good food. Especially Mexican food.   Little shop (Probably 10-15 tables) conveniently sandwiched in between Walgreen's and Safeway so you don't end up shopping on an empty stomach. That could be really dangerous.   Cheap. Filling. Fattening. Yummy.

My g-chat status has been set to "Los Taquitos FTW!" for about three weeks now. No, not because I am too lazy to change it, because I pretty much eat Los Taquitos every single day.   If you are a follower of mine, you have probably learned by now that I have an obsessive personality, especially when it comes to food. The problem is, it is SO good here I JUST CANNOT STOP.  I cannot eat the a-la-carte Chile Relleno anymore (not vegan), but it is so freaking good and I really wish I could. My friend recently got it in burrito form and I think it was true love.  Dallas G. loves the bean burrito with a little guac on the side. There is something about their beans that make you salivate just thinking about them.  But, here is what just makes my soul sing: The three hard taco combo. I get it with beans (no meat) and no cheese, and add pico. I get all beans with no cheese on the side. I lather that ish up with the green sauce, and suddenly all is right in the world.  The clock just struck 8:30am... guess what that means? That's Right! TACO TIME!

Although I'm currently sitting in the pedicure chair, I have been here a grip of times and absolutely love Smiley Nails!!!   Super convenient (right by Bank of America, Sakana Sushi, AND my office), reasonable prices, great service, and SUPER friendly staff!!!   8 pedicure chairs, 8 nail stations , and a waxing room. Relatively small but I have never had a wait.  You can consider me a regular!!!

Dr. DeMark is the best dentist on the planet. He is so friendly, warm, and funny. Always making jokes, telling you exactly what he is going to do, and checking in during procedures to make sure you are okay. He calls you the night of your procedure just to make sure everything is okay instead of having you sit in pain miserable overnight on the rare case something goes awry.   Most people hate their dentists, but, I love mine! If he wasn't married with 8 kids, I'm sure he would love me too!  Anyway, onto business. The whole entire office at Today's Dental is super friendly and accommodating. I love going there (seriously) because everyone is so nice and friendly, they make sure all of your questions are answered, and they spend whatever time they need with you versus making you feel like a number.   The office is really nice, clean, and they have two TV's with about 100 channels in every room. One for when you are sitting up, and one on the ceiling when you are laying down! Baller!  The hours are great and they normally always have lunch appointments available.   100% recommend this office. I have referred 4 people there already who are equally as happy with Dr. DeMark and Today's Dental!

If you want to have a horrific customer service experience, then make sure you go to Eyemaster's on Ray Rd. They will ensure you a terrible time.  If you love being lied to about someone accepting your insurance, if you love waiting (when you have a scheduled appointment) for 45+ minutes just to be seen, and if you love asking for the thinnest contacts possible and receiving incredibly thick ones, then look no further.. you have found your Eden.   Oh, and if you need a copy of your prescription sent over because, god forbid, you decide to choose a different contacts/eyeglass provider... well, just don't even waste your time because they will try and prevent you from getting it by claiming you have to come in for a follow-up before they issue it, and when you argue until you are blue in the face and they FINALLY agree to give it to you... they will keep you waiting and waiting and waiting.   HORRIBLE experience. I will never, ever set foot in this or ANY Eyemaster's ever again. Terrible

When you decide to become a vegetarian, you realize that there are some sacrifices you are going to have to make in the food department. When I became veg, veggie burgers were made by mixing this powder with water and frying it in a pan. It was horrible. I pretty much ate grilled cheese for the first year.   Now, fifteen years later, Capriotti's...  Holy Shit!!! VEGGIE TURKEY SUB. Tears of joy are streaming down my face at THIS very moment. It's like losing your virginity all over again, but this time its good! Real good!  For $7.75 I have the hugest, most delicious sub I have ever eaten in my life. Such good quality ingredients, and this medium is HUGE!  They also have New York Kettle Style Chips, which are delish, but you definitely don't need them when you have 12" of veggie turkey sub staring you down.  My life seriously just changed.

Chipotle is the best business model of the 21st Century, and this location wholly embodies the Chipotle perfection.  Chipotle uses naturally raised meats, hormone free dairy, no eggs or nuts, organic beans, seasonal produce, and promote recycling within the restaurants. This means that they care what you are putting into your body and what it is doing to the environment!! (score!)  Their simple menu makes ordering easy, but still allows you variety (Burrito, Salad, Tacos, Bowls) and caters to a carnivore, vegetarian, or vegan. In fact, they are pretty "food-allergy" safe in general. (Believe me, I have experience)  As if the food wasn't enough, they have two amazing ordering systems: Iphone App and Online Ordering. Let's talk about this online ordering system here for a minute, because it is what I think really sets the bar high for their competitors and other restaurants in general:  I run a medium sized business and when lunch comes around, my Operations staff of ten has the WORST time executing something as simple as a lunch order. I know this sounds ridiculous, but believe me, it is as true as the day is long. This all changed when I discovered Chipotle Online Ordering.   Anyway, I go online, login, and tell the system I want a group order. It then emails each of my employees giving them a link to order or a link to decline. If they choose to order, the link takes them right to an online order page with pictures, places for memos, etc. They select exactly what they want and it gets added to our group order.  Once everyone has ordered, I hit submit, pay by credit card, and fifteen minutes later you arrive at Chipotle, give them a jingle, and they will actually bring the food right out to your car for you. They call this the "valet" service. Perfect if you can't find a spot or it is raining out!!  Chipotle Executives must have sat down and thought of every pain a company could have in ordering lunch because I honestly cannot think of one thing that would improve this process. (Well, delivery would be nice... but that is what I have a receptionist for)  I want to take a second to recognize this particular location, on 54th Street. Let me start by saying, I believe that you can taste the love in food... as in, if someone is cranky as shit, making your food, it is not as good as if they are smiling, enjoying their lives. I know this probably sounds crazy, but I swear on my right hand it is true. EVERY time I have ever eaten here (we are talking dozens of times) my food has been fabulous! I can taste the LOVE!   Oh, and about two hours after pickup, someone calls to ask how everything was and to let you know that they took special care to pack it up and make sure everything was right. If there is a Best Chipotle award, this location deserves it!  My final note: I get the salad with black beans, rice, tomato salsa, green tomatillo salsa, and guacamole. 100% vegan, 100% delicious. Under 500 calories, 17g of fat, and 14g of protein. And I am full. REAL full.   Since I have started eating Chipotle 3-4 times a week, I have actually started losing weight. Perhaps I will be the next Jared!

This GC is the worst in the state, IMO.  First of all it's smaller than the other locations I have been to. They also have higher prices. I guess that's what you get being in Scottsdale.  The last time I went in I needed a standard bass case. After waiting around for about 15 minutes to get some help, I finally got some assistance from an associate. I asked about the bass cases and he knew very little despite the fact that he worked in the department. I finally said, fine.. I will take that one. The guy disappeared into the back for literally 20 minutes. He came back and no-go. They dint have any, dint know when they will have any in stock again.   Customer service is bad. Small store. Overpriced.   Go to one of the other locations if you ask me.

Arizona Mills has the worst bathrooms I have ever been in. They are always really, really smelly and warm.  I like that there are outlet stores, so you can save a lot of money, but at the same time some of the stores they have are really ghetto and a lot of the outlets have ghetto items.  The mall is always really packed and there are a ton of kids running around. People walk on the wrong side of the mall, or walk in large groups that prevent people from getting by.  And the worst part: there are at least ten different cell phone kiosks and you get badgered every time you walk by. They wont leave you alone. They also have two or three of those carts that sell lotion. I have had people chase me into stores trying to get me to buy natural sea potions. It's just annoying and always makes my shopping experience uncomfortable.

Xtreme Bean Rules. Any bank-become-coffee-shop is a place for me..   We started hitting up XB back in '03 because it is open 24 hours on the weekend ... not to mention they give you double the size that you would get at Starbucks for less. Also like the idea that it is not a giant chain coffee shop.   Great selections of coffees, teas (loose leaf), bakery items, frozen/blended drinks and Italian soda's. We LOVE the Carmel Royales.  They have tons of space to play games, and they even have some games and books in one of the back rooms. They also frequently have live bands or musicians performing and FREE WI-FI that works really well.   XB rules.

When you notice a spot on your eye that doesn't go away after fifteen saline flushes, you get a little stressed... actually, I think frantic bordering on completely losing your mind is a little more accurate.   I called up Dr. Irene's office in this Lens Crafters completely out of my mind, and was really impressed with the way the girls were able to calm me down and get me right in for an appointment.   Dr. Irene took plenty of time going over the problem (corneal ulcer as a result of wearing my contacts too much), how to prevent it from happening again, and what the solution was. He is funny in that dry sort of way but extremely thorough and I felt like he actually cared about my issue.   The staff that works on the optometry side of things rule. They are funny and sarcastic, but nice and extremely helpful.   Now on to the Lens Crafters. They have a good selection and I love that you can get your glasses made in an hour. The gal that helped me ROCKED! She was super funny and got stuff taken care of immediately. She even compared the specials they were having against my insurance so I could get my glasses for the cheapest amount.   Any time I need an eye appointment, glasses or contacts, I am here.. and I will definitely recommend this Lens Crafters to others.   SEE you later ... ha ha, I'm so funny

This place is not good. Unfortunately it is one of the only all ages venues for bands to play at in the metro area, so good bands get stuck here.  The stage area is awkwardly sanctioned off with caution tape separating the under/over 21 crowd.   The bar service in The band area is really awful. I had to wait ten minutes to get some waters. Bear in mind that there was nobody at the bar, so it wasn't because I was waiting in a huge line. The guy had major attitude too.  The sound guy is NOT good. The lighting in the main bar/pool table area is WAY too bright.   People are going to get stuck going here to see local bands they like, but just know, the place is not a good venue so don't expect much.

I met Yelpette's Georgie S and Sunny B today for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. In addition to famously amazing company, the food was really good, we had quick and efficient service and I was happy with the portions and price.   We started with Hummus, which came out immediately. It was pretty tasty. Both Sunny and I had the falafel pita/ sandwich. I was really impressed with how moist the falafel was. Normally it comes out really dry. We also got soup with our meal. I had tomato, which was EXCELLENT and she had the lentil. I forgot to ask how it was. Georgie had some chicken and rice thing which looked good and she said she enjoyed.   Our server was a little aggressive with Georgie and Sunny because they didn't finish all of their food (yeah... I'm a big pig and devoured everything in front of me) but I think he was just trying to ensure they were happy with their meals.   For the three of us plus the takeaway chicken sandwich for my sister, the $34 tab was extremely reasonable and they handled our multiple payment methods like a champ!   Next time I am in Tempe and in the mood for some falafel, I will be back!!!

Any place that will allow me to show up and roller skate while wearing a gold jumpsuit/skirt combo is a place for me.   Just don't tell my behind that we are going to go back. It's still sore from all the spills I took trying to be crafty with cross overs last Friday.

This place is SO fun. I went there with a friend and we had such a blast.  The drinks are reasonable and the house band is amazing. They take requests and even though I am not a Jazz/Funk /Blues fan, I knew every song they played. ("Lets Get it On" "Brick House" "Pink Cadillac")  The venue is really awesome inside. It is really dark and they have red Christmas lights everywhere, so it feels really sexy.  Only downfall is that the place is small so it gets crowded, which also makes parking tough.  I would definitely give Chars a shot. Like I said, I am not into Jazz/Funk/Blues but I had a lot of fun and the energy in there is great. Everyone is happy and enjoying themselves.

I am a big fan of Mi Patio ... the food is extremely reasonably priced and they always have specials on beers and margaritas.  What is most important for me is that they have a ton of vegetarian options. The beans are veggie friendly, so they have multiple choices from bean burros to taco salads to quesedillas to veggie burros... etc etc  The service is always really good to. The chips and salsa are provided immediately, and they food is always out pretty quick.  This place is certainly not upscale, but perfect if you want some good mexican food and a place to chill out.

I am writing an update because it DOES NOT get better than a freaking plate sized cheese stick.   Seriously.   Get the quesapilla. It is a sopapilla filled with cheese. That's it. Your heart will hate you but your belly will love you.   Seriously.   Oh, and you cannot beat a $9 pitcher of margaritas.   Seriously.

Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, so I feel quite qualified to give a solid four star review to The Eye Opener.   Before I get to far, this is a diner. If you are a snob, spare yourself and the pleasant folk who work here and go somewhere else.   The very pregnant waitress handled our very large VYE group quickly and efficiently. I don't think I could have walked across the room with a belly that big, but she glided around taking orders and delivering drinks like she was training for a marathon. Okay, I exaggerate a little.   For diner coffee, I don't think it was bad at all (sorry christina!). In fact, it was way better than coffee at Denny's or IHOP.   My meal was pretty tasty. I ordered an egg white omelet with green chili, hash browns and an english muffin. I was really glad to see the large portion size because after packing bags all morning, I was HUNGRY.   I am pretty sure that the salsa they had sitting at the table was really pizza sauce, but fortunately they had Tabasco so I was good to go.   I think my meal was like ten bucks. I tipped our lovely waitress five. My breakfast and the experience was more than worth the fifteen :)

I have lived in Arizona my whole entire life, and I cannot believe that it took until today for me to make it out to Canyon Lake and take a cruise on Dolly Steamboat.  We had some out of town family visiting and we decided to take them up through the Apache Trail and for a ride on The Dolly Steamboat. It was a really nice drive up through the mountains. The road twists and turns, so if you are scared of heights and driving on turns, then have someone else drive for you. There were some AMAZING views and it was just a perfect day out, so we drive with the windows down.  They have two rides per day; 12pm and 2pm. We took the noon cruise. Make sure you wear sunscreen and a hat or you will get sun burned. They also have dinner cruises you can take, but only on special days, so check their website to be sure: www.dollysteamboat.com  Standard cruise lasts 90 minutes. The boat fits a lot of people, but I would recommend making reservations so you are guaranteed a spot. It was packed today.  The tour guide was really funny and shared a bunch of facts throughout the trip. We saw a lot of beautiful mountains and a bunch of longhorn sheep. It was pretty cool.  The boat had drinks and snacks and a restroom, so it is easy to make it through the 90 minute cruise comfortably :)  I wouldnt have changed anything about this trip!!!!! Ild asked everyone in the car how they would rate the experience so I could yelp it and it was 5 stars all around. Definitely great place to take people from out of town!

This is my favorite strippy on earth!!!!!!!!!! Honestly, I cannot think of a time that I have come here that I didn't have a blast and I have been here a LOT.   Just like every strip club in America they have the standard blond, big boobied dancers... but they also have a bunch of alterna chicks sportin tatts, piercings and hair colors other than blond. It's great!   Every now and again you run into a crazy chic, like this dominatrix Asian chick who kept kneeing my friend in the throat??? but for the most part, all the dancers rule.   I don't think I have ever gotten anything other than diet coke there, so I cannot comment on the booze, but I don't think people go to strippies for a great drink anyway.   Parking can be tight, but I have never had trouble finding a spot within reasonable walking distance.   And I am severely disappointed that I can only choose up to 3 best nights.. because there are 7.

I have only been here once, but I really enjoyed it. It's a very upscale place, but they have (or had when I went) reasonable prices on food. I did a wine flight, which was fun and got a dessert sampler. Very tasty.  The decor and ambiance are really what make the place. I would say this is a great place for a date you want to impress. Fortunately it was not too packed and it was not filled with the normal south Scottsdale crowd. But who knows, maybe that's YOU.

This is a really amazing place to get a glass of wine and sit and relax with a friend or with a date. If you are a guy, take your girl here.. its a really impressive place and it has a very sexy environment.  In addition to great atmosphere and an expansive wine selection, they have a great fondue appetizer.  Perfect date - Kazimierz with wine and fondue

I was so pleasantly surprised by the experience I had last night at Malee's. I was expecting your typical Scottsdale crowd, prices and wait staff, but what I found was exactly opposite.   When me and the lovely CP entered, we were warmly welcomed by the hostess. This shocked me since most times hostesses are snotty as can be. We were seated in a large, comfortable booth and immediately greeted by our waitress, Angel.   Angel was also extremely friendly, accommodating, had a really good knowledge of their offerings and provided really great service.   I was extremely impressed with the prices. We got two meals, two beers and a glass of wine for under $40.   I really enjoyed the dishes, and they were plated well. We got the yellow curry with tofu (+ tofu at no extra charge is awesome!!) and the Hippy noodles with tofu. Both were extremely flavorful and perfectly spiced.   The ambiance was great, the food was great, the service was great and the prices were great. I have no complaints and I will be back for sure!

Martini Ranch is the only club in Scottsdale I don't hate. This review is really a 3.5 and I will round up this time... just remind me to round down on my next review to even things out.   They would be a full fledged 4 stars if my vodka red bull did not cost NINE DOLLARS. I can easily buy an extra large red bull and a small bottle of Gordon's for that price. sheesh.  The other lost star is for the extreme doosh bags that seem to always be lurking around.   However... They have an awesome sound system and sound check guy that puts on really good shows (I have seen three concerts), host awesome parties (Yelp Rocks!) and they have METALHEAD on Sunday Nights!!!  The place is huge with multiple bars and levels including an outdoor area that I think makes a huge difference. I hate clubs where everyone is packed into one square room.  Finally, they make the chicks wear little skimpy outfits. Who can complain about that?? Not me!  See ya at the Martini next time my friends force me into Scottsdale!

Dive Bar. Do not go in here expecting a schwanky place.  They have the best juke box in town, though.   THe drinks are cheap, the service is good. What more can you ask for?  Something to note... this place is not very big and gets packed on the weekends, so come early and start your night off here.. .and end somewhere else

I want to hate Ra because, well, it's Ra. But the truth is, every time I come here I leave happy and satisfied.   Being a Veggie, sushi is really hit-or-miss but I always seem to get pretty lucky here. Tonight was no exception. Everything was really full of flavor and really fresh. You are probably thinking that it is hard to mess up veggies, but I have had some bad sushi before (Stingray!!!!!!)   I was stoked when I asked the waitress to recommend a Chard (they had four) and she actually made a suggestion. I was really happy with it and was even more delighted that she pointed out something on the happy hour menu.   I really like the atmosphere. I have a thing for balls. I mean red orbs. Only complaint is that the music is normally wayyyyy too loud. The service is always really good, so they balance one another out.  Oh...we also tried the Cinnamon tempura ice cream with raspberry drizzle. OH MY FREAKING GOD. It was... absolutely orgasmic! YUM!  Now if they could only fix the parking issue...

Good location, bad service.   It was not a busy Thursday night, but our waitress was literally 20+ minutes in between stops.   The nachos were not really nachos. More of a salad mixed with some tortilla chips, that happen to be burnt.   Christina ordered a lavosh thingy and it came out cold.   The food was way overpriced. I only had one drink. It was stiff, so that is good.   This place was just really meh.

I have been to The Cove twice now; once for a dinner UYE and once for lunch with a group of bridesmaids after we got our mani/pedis in the same plaza.   I'm really excited that they have gluten free options, both in pizza and in pasta form. They also have quite a few vegetarian/vegan options.   I had the Pasta Rustica sans goat cheese, and it was really delightful and a great size for being on the lunch menu. I have also had the vegetali antipasto and it was REALLLY good. The gluten free pizza crust is pretty good, but I couldn't have cheese on it, so the "margherita" was just ok. Not their fault.  Pretty good wine list, friendly, attentive service, nice environment, and an awesome patio. Definitely a good choice if you are up in the area, and reasonably priced to boot!

I am going to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by Frasher's.   Normally I wouldn't be caught dead in a steakhouse being that I am a vegetarian, but the bar area here is pretty cool. Nice, dark and loungy.   They had really tasty fried ravioli, bread and the ooey gooey cake. Yeah. That cake was godly.   We had amazing service. Our server was extremely attentive and friendly. We got our food and drinks really quickly. And it was still warm when it got to the table. That's a plus. ha   My one negative comment stems from the bathroom. They had some cleaning chemicals lying around and I kind of felt like I was in a meth lab.  Not that I know what a meth lab looks like, but one can assume.   Good location... McDowell and Scottsdale... or just north of McDowell. It's far enough away from everything to not be crowded, but a good place to add into the rotation.   I cannot wait to go back for that cake... mmmmm,,,,

I cannot begin to explain the sheer excitement I feel knowing that I have yet to review BOP. I better take a deep breath....   ...in.... out... in ... out... okay, I'm good.   I love this place and it is so unexpected! I went to watch a friends band play next door at Chyro Arts and they invited me to BOP. I agreed thinking I was going to be miserable. But no. Not at all. This place is a freaking gem.   Their food is SO FREAKING GOOD. The mac and cheese... omg... they have a bunch of food for veggies, which rules.   I see from other reviews that they have pub quizzes and I am going to have to hit that up one of these days.   The best part? They are at Scotts/McDowell, conveniently located 2 miles from my house.   Oh, and the other best part, no yuppies.    ONLY COMPLAINT ... the waitresses are a little slow.

I'm writing an update because I came for Trivia Night last night and had a BLAST!!!!!!!!! Every seat in the house was full, but the service was on spot and the vibe was killer..   I also found that that they have quite a few flavored vodkas, including pomegranate, so I was excited to try something new.  Again, the Mac and Cheese was SO good... I had two bowls. That's right, TWO bowls. What a pig.   I think I will become a Tuesday night regular!

"Before both of my feet fully entered Flicka's, I knew I had already contracted the Swine Flu.." Thanks to Georgie S, I now know why I have a sore throat, cough and achy body. Thanks Flicka's for giving me Swine Flu.   This place is really disorganized, the wait staff (the bartenders the waitresses the bussers) are all really snotty and were all rude, not to mention slow as the second coming.   The nicest person in that bar was the little Mexican flower guy who fell in love with me and gave me a pair of roses, free of charge.   The one good thing about this bar was the cheap beers. My Corona was $2.50 and the Bud Lights were $2.   The outdoor patio is cool, but it is filled with all the smokers so unless you want to catch lung cancer, it is smart to just stay inside.   My friends band played (I have seen them play at least a dozen times in a variety of venues) and the sound was so horrible. You couldn't hear vocals at all.   In between the 5 rock bands that played, they piped R&B music over the speakers. I thought this was a little strange.... and I also found the massive dance orgy that busted out to be a little strange.  Some dude sent his wing-woman over to the bar while I was getting drinks to try and get me to join their table. She was the oldest looking wing-woman I have ever seen. It made me immediately want to cancel my tanning membership.   What a really weird group of people here. Seriously.   I didn't really care for the food. I consider myself a nachos connoisseur now that I date Dallas G, and these nachos were sub-par.   I highly doubt I will ever be back to this weird ass place!

If I liked beer, Four Peaks would be getting five stars. (I will say they have a peach ale that is realllly tasty!!)   I wish I were my dad right now (that's creepy, I know) because his cabinet shop is literally right next door and he frequents this joint at least once a week. He has probably tried every beer and item on the menu over the past few years.   I have been to this Four Peaks probably four times now, and I have been really happy with everything I have eaten. The 5-Layer Nachos (sofaking gooooodddd!!), Spinach Dip, Pizza, Hummus and even the Veggie Burger. They pour a healthy vodka soda and the prices are reasonable. Service is a tiny bit slow, but it is Tempe.  One of my favorite things about this location is that it is hidden from the world. If you didn't know it was there, you wouldn't know it was there (I swear that makes sense in MY head). I just wish they would allow you to bring dogs on the patio!  If you ever get a spare moment, find Dallas G and ask him to tell you his story about Nachos. It's quite a tale told with so much fervor that you yourself might start believing in their power...   And if all of this wasn't enough, it's right next door to Uranus Studios (owned and operated by Robin Wilson of the Goo Goo Dolls) so you may get to split bread with someone relatively famous in the 90's!

I began my love affair with Ethiopian food last year when I went to visit a friend in New York and he opened my eyes to the delights of this interesting, yet amazing food.  I'm not sure if I can actually classify it a "love affair" being that I have only been three times now, but it is what it feels like. With my recent gluten allergy, it has been terrible finding carbs and luckily the Injera bread is 100% gluten free (it is made with teff) so I can eat to my hearts desire!  Another really neat thing about Blue Nile is that they serve a small raw menu every day, and a full blown raw menu on Sunday and Monday. I don't know of anywhere else in the valley that does this, so definitely a great thing to see! I cannot wait to come back and try their raw creations. That is, if you can pull me away from the injera :-)  Now, the one drawback that ALMOST turns this place from a 5 to a 4 is that they have the scariest parking lot I have ever seen. I made Dallas G. watch me walk back to the car, in broad daylight, just to ensure I was not accosted. Well, that, and I have a great ass ;-)  Oooo and they have this magical tea that has such a unique flavor. I absolutely love it!  Extremely affordable, very tasty, great service... WINNER!!!!!

Using their Online Ordering system is a COMPLETE waste of time. Both times we used it we ended up waiting an additional 30 minutes for them to finish our food even though we ordered over an hour in advance.  Both times there have been problems with the orders even though everything is in written form in front of their faces.  Today, instead of individually wrapping our pitas, they gave us a bag of store bought pita bread. How tacky.  When you call to make a complaint about it taking an unreasonable amount of time, and when your orders are incorrect, they treat you with a horrible attitude as if YOU did something wrong. If you make a mistake, at very least own up to it.   And the food is overall pretty bland, just like all other Pita Jungle's.  We will not be ordering from Pita Jungle again.

Green is amazing, and by far the best veggie/vegan restaurant I have ever been to. The atmosphere is fun and the food is GREAT!!   I HIGHLY recommend the BBQ Chicken Sandwich. They have a special espresso sauce and it is to die for. The Thyme fries are also really, really amazing!   This is not a healthy veggie place... they have asian dishes, but most of their dishes are "comfort food" .. they have vegan pizzas, bbq chicken sandwiches, meatball sandwiches, fries, buffalo wings... all the type of stuff most vegetarians/vegas CRAVE. I know I am sick of eating pasta and veggie burgers all the time. Now I can eat regular type foods again without spending hours cooking them.   Fortunately I live about five minutes from here, so I can keep going back and trying more items.  :)

Green. I love you. You are my soul mate.  Why? Because you have never once in our relationship treated me bad. Never. In fact, I know I do not deserve you.  Normally I eat AT Green, but tonight I decided to order take out for the first time. I got the samosas and coconut curry with tofu. I didn't think it was possible to like anything better than the secret bbq chicken sandwich, but I think I found it.   The gal said ten minutes, I got there in ten minutes, it was ready waiting for me.. packaged up like a gift from heaven... and by the time I got it home.. it was still warm. And heavenly.   Also, there was some very pleasing eye candy sitting outside... maybe I should have eaten there. Silly me.

I already knew I loved @greendamon/Green because they offer a safe haven for vegans (and non-vegans) that realize being vegan or vegetarian does not mean you have to eat healthy, and that every meal doesn't have to be made of vegetables.  So, there are some majorly delish dishes... the artichoke gratine, the samosas, orecciette pasta with meatballs, the secret bbq chicken sandwich... and they always have some creative special.  Last night we stopped in after the Paso Robles wine tasting at FLEMINGS STEAK HOUSE... hey... we needed to counter all the flesh we saw being devoured....   and right before my eyes was the most magical and delicious creation known to man. Seriously. Like hands down best thing I have ever ever ever eaten. EVER!!  So, Green - if you don't put the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich on your full time menu, I think you are denying the good people of Arizona what they deserve: perfection.  An amazingly fresh and tasty roll topped with crispy bacon, chicken, mayo, fresh sliced avacado, CRISPY cheese, and jalapenos. Sure, doesn't sound that special...  BUT I ORDERED TWO. I wanted to order another. I want one right now. In fact, I cannot imagine a moment in my life where I won't be craving this amazing creation.  So - do yourself a favor. Try Green because the food is great, they care about all living beings, they have vegan blizzards, and one day they will have the best thing you have ever eaten on their menu.  I'm going to write a letter a day until they add it to their menu. I'm serious. I can be a real pest.

I cannot believe I am giving Dos Gringos 5 Stars, but you better believe I am. Why, you ask, is this Cenpho junkie giving an EXTREMELY Tempe bar five stars?   1. The one and only fight I have ever been in took place here. (yes, I won)  2. I got trashed the other night for $5.  3. You are inside and outside at exactly the same time.  4. They have ample bathroom stalls in the women's restroom.  5. There are bowls of limes on the counters. I hate asking for lime.  6. I get hit on at least three times before I finish my first drink.  7. They have live music.  8. You can get molested in public without being arrested  9. I always get carded.

We order from Apple Spice here at the office at least once per week. It started out just one or two of us, and has grown into five or six, surely more to jump on board!   They do these things called "box lunches" where you get a side (pasta/potato/frog eye salad or chips), a pickle, a treat (normally a cookie) and condiments including mustard, mayo, lettuce and tomato. The wide variety of sandwiches are either 6.95 or 7.95 and include all of the above.   If you are an Amazon, or just eat like one (Me, that's right, guilty as charged) you can get the "executive box" for $2 more... and it includes all of the above PLUS a side of veggies (carrots, broccoli, celery, black olives, etc) with a side of ranch, a bag of chips and cheesecake.!!!!   So, for $8.95 I am stuffed out of my mind and so happy because the egg salad that I get every time is always moist and flavorful, and I really love the sourdough bread it comes on!   Some of the other girls from the office religiously order the Roast Beef Deluxe and Breast of Turkey, as well.   f you order a minimum of three lunches before 10:30am, they will deliver for you :) We normally don't start thinking about lunch until then, so we always forget, but we call and place the order and its ready for pickup about fifteen minutes later. Easy!   I would definitely use them for catering should the need arise!   Way to go Apple Spice!!

I hate writing this update because I used to really love Apple Spice, but the last three times we have ordered lunch there have been multiple mistakes. For a place that does catering, getting 10 lunches right doesn't really seem like too much to ask.  Today, two people ordered bread bowls. They received a very small container of soup with a slice of bread. That is not really a bread bowl.  Me and one of my vegan co-workers ordered the southwestern salad, sans cheese. It came with chicken, and on the menu it states you have to pay an additional $1 for chicken, so it would definitely be something someone needed to ask for.  One of the lunches came as a sandwich instead of a wrap, and Heather W. was missing her cookie and her juice with her meal.  Apple Spice was nice enough to replace the mistaken items (brought corrected salads, brought the actual bread bowls - although, not with new soup, brought the wrap) and bring us an extra plate of cookies, but like I said, this is the third time this type of mistake has happened.   It's pretty expensive, the Southwestern is not even very good, and once the order comes back wrong it delays my eating for an hour + and it is just frustrating.  I'm sorry Apple Spice... you guys are great but you need to get it together.

YUM YUM YUM  I have been dining at C.E. for several years now and have always gotten the DELICIOUS honey tofu (ask for it extra crispy).   We used to go in here 2-3 times a month but have not been as much recently because me and the man are on diets. Too much deep fried tofu :)  This is a family run place and the daughter can normally be found up front, and the son makes the deliveries. They are super nice!  Really good lunch specials, and I have been with a few non-veggies before who have gotten some other items.  This is not a high class place... more like a take out Chinese place with some tables to eat. They do have some cool track lighting, but like I said, you are not dining in luxury.  The only reason I do not give it five stars is because they have Pepsi products (I'm a dc girl) and you have to walk around back to use the restroom and it is not the... nicest... bathroom in the world.  REALLY GOOD FOOD!

I have never really been impressed with Trader Joes. I find them to be over priced and lacking variety. I have had hit-or-miss luck with finding vegetarian options. I guess I might be happier if I were a meat eater.  Also, the produce selection is always really limited, at least the the Camelback Location.  Just my two cents.

I absolutely LOVE Kiss the Cook. It is the cutest little place for breakfast and I love going here.  The quaint little restaurant is decorated with country antiques and most of them are for sale. It reminds me of a place you would find in Prescott.  I have had a few things on the menu and have always been delighted. The coffee is a little week, but then again, I start each day with a quad espresso so it may be unfair for me to judge.  While you wait for breakfast they bring out a variety of VERY tasty muffins and bread... so, so tasty!!!!  Good service and prices. No complaints from me :)

Me and the man went to Spur Cross Stables last weekend and had a blast. My favorite part was the OVERSIZED pig named Gilbert. I think he was bigger than my horse.. girth wise... ha ha  Anyways, don't be a fool like us and drive your Lexus out there. The pavement ends and you are driving on a rock road for about two miles. We made it, but would have preferred a more.. economical vehicle.  Our tour guide Travis was awesome, but he is moving back to Colorado at the end of the month so you will have to get another tour guide.   We really enjoyed the trail and everyone was really friendly.  Cost was reasonable.. I think it was $108 for the both of us... we did the 1.5 hour trail ride  The horses are a little... out there... now that I think about it. My boyfriend got stuck with a half horse half mule... and people we ran across laughed at him... but the horses were trained well and taken care of, so thats all that matters.  Dont forget to play with the giant pig. He rules.

Affliction: Check Faux-Hawks: Check Overbearing Cologne: Check  Now that I think of it, this is probably a perfect match: Women significantly past their prime and the douchebags of society waiting to pray off of them...  I shouldn't judge; I really shouldn't... I may end up here in 26 years when I am at the equivalent age of the majority demographic. In fact, thank god this place exists otherwise we may have to worry about the douchebags and douchebaguettes (credit, Dallas G.) infiltrating our beloved downtown favorites.   2 stars for the mojitos and wasabee dipping sauce.  Meeeeoooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

The only reason I am giving this place two stars is because the door guy came to the back of the line and allowed my group to breeze past to the front and pay half price.   They played the same fifteen songs over and over, the chick workers that were up on the stage screamed and sang into the microphone and it was horrific, there was no way anyone was getting a drink in the bar and sweat was literally pouring down my face and I was barely moving.  I'm kind of embarrassed to admit I even went here.

I am actually astounded right now because I have been to Amsterdam's at least twenty times before, but I have neglected to review.  First, let me start by saying that I have not been here for a few years and am completely delighted to report that this place is still as amazing as the last time I was here.  I used to come for happy hour once or twice a week and made my way here on a Saturday a time or two. I always have a great time, the drinks are always amazing, the crowd is always fun. What more can you ask for?

I am writing this update because I learned something new and incredible: Amsterdams has a dance area.  I have been coming here for about 4 years off and on, and I have always sat at the bar completely unaware that there is an awesome dance club/area attached! Hell yeah!

**This is a review of the bar only**  I am at least 15% cooler after having sipped on a vodka gimlet in the bar at Durant's.   Sure I smelled like steak after I left and felt weird about walking through the kitchen to get in and out. But for the hour I was there, I was felt cool as shit.  And my drink wasn't half bad either.

I have never wanted to give a 5 star rating as much as I want to give Richardson's one... and despite the most amazing food I have ever tasted.. I cannot give you 5, Richardson's, because the bartender/server left a lot to be desired.   Maybe if we had sat at a table versus the bar, it would have been different, but it wasn't, so I have to Yelp accordingly.   I will admit, the temperature was perfect, the ambiance was great, the bathrooms had those thick towel/paper towel hybrids and I had outstanding company, but boy oh boy.. the bartender had quite the stick up his behind.   Anyway, um... the huevos rancheros with red sauce.. eggs scrambled.. was literally the best thing I have ever eaten in all my life. I literally wanted to sit there and digest fully so that I could eat it again.   I must say that the best part about this place is the menu.. and how it specifically states "high chairs and booster seets will not be provided." Yes, that's right, this place is not kid friendly, which is fine by me!  This place rules. The food rules. I will be back, and hopefully said bartender will have removed the stick and I can update with 5 stars :)

I am ready to update you to a five because the last three times I have been there, your service has been better, the huevos rancheros has been consistently perfect, I have never had to wait for a seat at the bar and I want to hug the cute new bartender because she is quirkily cute!!   If you were still serving breakfast at 6pm, I would come eat you now.

This location is a glorified garage sale. It smells and nobody speaks English. Children are running free pulling clothes off racks and smashing into people.   If you are lucky, you can find shoes, but I have never found jack shit for clothes.  Go upstairs to Marshall's and spare yourself.

I cannot stand this mall. They have some really awesome stores but the people who work in them are obnoxious. Most of the people walking around are snooty as can be, and everything is overpriced.  The food court has some good selection, but is always super crowded and you can rarely find anywhere to sit.  Parking is awful.

You always take a gamble when you stay in a hotel/casino you have never even been to before (yes, pun intended). I would say that I definitely came out a winner this time around!!  My sister just turned 21, so it was obviously necessary for me to take her to Vegas. Luckily my mom and my sisters best gal pal agreed. So we embarked on an adventure that I guarantee can not possibly be duplicated, but we were more than impressed with the accommodations we called 'home' for three nights.  I love my bed. We have had a wonderful, committed relationship for the past five years. Sure, I've slept around but I always knew I was coming back home to you. It was a close call this time... I didn't want to leave and I definitely spent more time sleeping than I should have. But I couldn't tear myself away! The bed was just so damn comfortable and the linens were so soft and luxurious!  Now, I wasn't really a fan of the restaurants they had there but they did have a cool bar called Kahunaville with a station outside by the pool. We got these huge huge huge drinks (three of us had to share) and I would say we had a pretty nice time relaxing by the pool. Not the coolest pool in the world, but it served its purpose and we found four lounge chairs next to one another.  Good location. The price was outstanding! We ended up paying like $80 per night. The rooms really were very nice, the bathrooms were huge (although there was no blow dryer in the room) and when our Ipod docking station wasn't working very well, we called down to room service and they brought us a new one within the hour.  Great value, amazing bed... if I can muster up the will to go to Vegas again, I will certainly be back to share another night of bliss with the amazing bed.

Lee's sandwiches rules. They have AMAZING bread, a HUGE selection and a fantastic price!!!  I have never heard one bad word about any of the sandwiches, and have been here over a dozen times myself.  I always get the egg salad. It is absolutely amazing. I also recommend the vegetarian Asian sandwich. My old boss used to get the spring rolls/egg rolls and eat ten or twelve at a time.   The sandwiches are huge and are normally $3 or $4 and they have tons of different bubble tea options and sides.   The place is really cool too- bright, open spaces with lots of neon and extremely clean.   Great place for lunch, especially if you are on the go. BUTTTTT... the only drawback is they do not accept credit cards, so bring cash. If you forget, they have an ATM.  Oh, and make sure you bring an extra buck and take a baguette home... they sell their day old break for a buck and it is SO worth it!

After three visits to Fez, I am addicted. Actually, if I weren't addicted I probably wouldn't have made it a third time...   First off, this place has the coolest innards. I want to live here.   I think it is a cardinal sin NOT to get the sweet potato fries... omg, absolutely breathtaking... and whatever that dipping sauce is... oh so yummmm!!   Fez makes a VERY strong drink. by VERY, I mean.. I am pretty sure I was drunk off of three sips of my Feztini. It may cost 9 bucks, but I think you get the alcohol equivalent of three drinks!   The hummus is also extremely tasty... we also tried the bruschetta appetizer last time and that was great.   The bathrooms are super hot. I wish I could just spend the night in there.   Thomas is the sweetest, most loveliest person. He came to the table and chatted with us for a bit, which made our dining experience all the better. Last Sunday David did the same. The people that work/live here are amazing.   I cannot wait to try Fez out for Brunch! I took a peek at the brunch menu and I am seriously considering taking myself there on a date this morning!

I have now been to Fez for two events, brunch, lunch, dinner and time at the bar, so I figured I should update. I also checked my bank account, and it looks like in the past 30 days I have spent over $300.... yikes!  I'm a big fan of consistency, and every time I come to Fez, I have a consistently warm and amazing experience. The food is always top notch, aside from one busy Saturday night the service has always been pretty good, the drinks are strong and you cannot beat the environment. Or a smiling, happy, hugging Thomas.   Fez. I love you. My bank account hates you. I need to start working some swerve and get someone to take me on an all-expense-paid date here.. ha ha   PS The green pasta rocks my socks

Wow... I am immediately adding this to my "Recent Discoveries: Lovely places I cannot believe I have been living without"  Actually had delivery last night, so I cannot comment on the establishment itself, but I have been in the parking lot many times.  We had pizza and pasta, and both were absolutely amazing. The funny thing was, I am told that last nights tasty treats were not as good as usual. I cannot imagine that, but it was said.  Normally I salt and cheese my pizza, but I ate this straight up, no flavorings. That is quite the accomplishment!!  The pasta (I forget which kind it was) had a really different but amazing flavor. I also enjoyed dunking the bread.  I am so excited to discover MM delivers to me, although I am not excited about the amount of weight I am going to gain as a result... better start doubling my diet pill intake...

They have vegan chicken-and-waffles. And vegan milkshakes. And lots of other amazing vegan breakfast and lunch options.   Oh, and the vegan chicken-and-waffles are like the best thing I've ever eaten.   My carnivorous friends really enjoyed the regular chicken-and-waffles, the basic breakfast, and positively raved over the donuts.   My only complaint is that I ordered Kaluah in my milkshake and it cost me $10 making the milkshake $17.50. Ouch.

Indian Food is by far my favorite, and I was so pleased to run into Tamba on the strip! We came during lunch and were able to eat off of the buffet and get unlimited non-alcoholic drinks for $13.  Being vegetarians, we were totally stoked that they had at least 5 different dishes in addition to rice, naan, and those weird soda break things.  I learned that I love Dal Makni, Malai Paneer, and Punjabi Curry, which would be things I would normally not get to try because I always order my favorite, Muttar Paneer.  Anyway, the service was really great, the location was awesome, and the food was so incredibly tasty. Five Stars alllll the way!!!

I have been told about Matt's countless times and always heard about what a tiny place it was, but until I actually went for the first time, I never got the irony in the name "Matt's Big Breakfast."   I was doped up on anesthesia, so I really enjoyed sitting at the window bar so I could people watch, and so that the other patrons could not watch my weird facial expressions.   For a vegetarian, the menu did not have a huge offering, but it was a clear choice for me: egg and cheese omelet with cheddar and provolone, hash-browns, sourdough toast and coffee.   Ummm... DELICIOUS!!!! Seriously, this breakfast was really awesome. I might have gained five pounds from the butter it was all cooked in, but really, who cares.   The blackberry jam they happened to be serving that day was absolutely phenomenal, and I hate jam, so you know it must have been good.   I don't know if they have a bathroom but it did not appear so. As previously mentioned in probably every review and earlier in my review, this place is reallllly small.   The service was great. They served our drinks, took our order and served our food quicker than I expected, especially since the place was packed the entire time.   The only thing that kept this place from being 5 stars was the coffee. It just wasn't good. Call me a coffee snob if you must.

I honestly cannot tell you how bad I hate this place. Not because I don't want to, just because I don't know how to articulate it properly.   Well, let's give it a shot anyway...  I might be a little more lenient if the people that worked here weren't completely and utterly condescending (which I hate SO FREAKING BAD), and if they knew the value of good service. Oh, and maybe this makes me a discriminator of sorts, but I really don't care for hippies. This is 2010. Cut your damn hair.  I swear every time I have been here (four times now, at least) I tell myself that I am NEVER coming back, even if a pack of wild wolves is chasing me down Roosevelt in the middle of a simmering hot summer day where my jelly shoes have melted into the asphalt... but somehow I always get dragged back and want to give them the benefit of the doubt. How does this keep happening.  The food isn't good either, and they stop serving anything cooked (even a grilled cheese - simplest creation known to man) pretty early.   Now that I'm on the proverbial wagon, and on this splendid gluten-free vegan diet, it will take more than that pack of wolves to get me back here... at very least it will take an act of god. Or a group of ninjas. They can be pretty convincing with those crazy throwing stars.

I really enjoyed Lisa G's. I went with a bunch of other Yelp-he's and Yelp-she's after the last OYE and was pleasantly surprised. I have driven by several times and I love the logo and the sign, and used to live within walking distance, so it was on my list of places to visit.  I love the fact that Lisa G is bopping around taking care of business. I think that people who actually participate in the day-to-day operations of their business are doing it right.  Everyone was really pleased with their meals, and I really enjoyed the taste of pizza I stole from my neighboring yelp-she.  I am definitely looking forward to hitting Lisa G's again and trying out some more tasty treats!

The food here is really really good. The service is normally really good as well. The only thing that makes it 4 versus 5 is the parking and it is a little pricey.  Try the tomatillo enchiladas. They are.... TO DIE FOR. In fact... I am craving them now... YUM!

Went to Padres last night with my best gal pal for the umpteenth time, and as usual, I was incredibly pleased.  We sat in the far back room off the patio and it was so lovely. There was a light breeze flowing in that was just as refreshing as my mojito. Ahhhhhh Mojitos. That thing kicked me on my ass!  As usual, we started with the guacamole, and as usual, it was incredibly tasty. The chips were fresh and the two accompanying salsas were delish.  I usually get the enchiladas, but since I am now vegan, that is out of the question. I opted for the three tostadas, and it was a great choice. Crunchy corn shell, fresh veggies, and really tasty black beans made a great base for the vat of the tomatillo sauce I poured on. Man I love that sauce.  Our service was incredibly friendly, like always, and even when the kitchen made a mistake it was correctly quickly and correctly.  Padres is one of those places I always forget how much I love until I go back, and upon my arrival, our romance ensues for another magical evening, and as I leave, I whisper gently,  "I'll call you Padres, I'll call you."

Hands down my favorite place in the Phoenix Metro area right now.  They have a really great happy hour, an extensive tap beer list, and a life changng veggie/vegan menu!  I am absolutely addicted to the Gardein Veggie Buffalo Wings. Beyond amazing. The tofu lettuce wraps are delish as well.  I'm really glad to see major restaurants catering to all sorts of dietary varieties versus leaving us veggies with the option of a side salad or plain pasta!  Chances are you will see me here at least once per week with a Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA and two orders of the Buffalo Veggie Wings ... sometimes twice... so if you have been waiting for that perfect moment to make contact with me, well, I suggest you hang around YH each night about 530.

Yeah - cool name but the place sucks. The people that work there are ... I won't even comment. The place is just not good.  The food is NOT good, and they have non existent options for vegetarians. They are overpriced. The location is good, being that it is at the Scottsdale Waterfront, but they are located on Camelback Road and its hard to find parking. Once you do, you have to walk a ways to get to Pink Taco.  The only good thing about this place is they have outdoor seating. The downside to that is you have to look at and hear the Camelback Road traffic.  Go somewhere else if you want my opinion.

Real Dill Pickles. REAL. They are amazing. Like, truly.  The sandwiches are like a foot tall. I guess that is why they are $25.  The food is average, in general. Although ... I feel like their french fries could single-handedly solve world peace.   The service is not so good. I felt like an imposition the entire time I was there. Maybe it was because I looked like hell from the night before. But it's not like they shouldn't be used to that. It is Vegas, after all.

I think Ticoz is a very strong 4, bordering on 5.  I have only been here for dinner, but I am interested to check it out for lunch.  I am in love with the guacammus. I would eat it every day if I could! I also had the sweet corn tamales, veggie style. Those were damn amazing.  The atmosphere is really cool. In fact, just being in this place makes me feel cool. Service was great too.

I have had Udupi bookmarked for about three months and I cannot believe it took me this long to make it over here, especially since it is less than seven minutes from my apartment.   I had dinner plans with an out-of-town friend and he mentioned being in the mood for Indian. The stars aligned and we ended up here.   I started out with a hot black tea and Mixed Vegetable Pakora as our appetizer. The deep fried potatoes and veggies came with two awesome sauces; one reminded me of A-1 sauce with a little sweet tang.   The waiter was extremely friendly and did not take offense to our slaughtering of the names of the menu items. He even made a bread suggestion and explained what each of the sauces were made of.   We opted to go with the Batura bread, which happens to be a giant deep fried poof of bread that tastes like a sopapilla. It actually looked like a giant jellyfish when it came to the table.   As an entree we went with my personal fav, Mutter Paneer, which was EXCELLENT, and Udupi Special Spring Dosai... basically thin crepe chutney spring roll type things. They were good, but not great.   Our food came out quickly, the service was attentive, the prices were reasonable and I was REALLY impressed with the taste, portions and quality of our dishes.   I will be back to Udupi for sure, this place is amazing!

I feel odd anytime I review a chain, but this particular location has set a pretty high bar for all other locations and they definitely deserve some props.  I have eaten at this location dozens of times throughout the years and have zero complaints. Seriously, not one botched order, rude employee or unhappy dining experience.  This past weekend I was partaking in a Rock Band marathon and we needed something in our bellies to keep us fueled up. It was about closing time but they had no problems making our dishes. Our food came out without any issues, piping hot and tasty, as usual.   We were offered to-go cups in case we wanted one for the road and because we were the last people there, the extra chocolate chip cookies from the day went home with us, free of charge!   Definitely a 5-star experience, every time!

I really wish I didn't wait until it was too cold to swim to actually come to The Clarendon, because they have the coolest pool I have ever seen. I heard about the Sunday swim parties but never got the balls up to go. My loss!   I have not actually stayed at the hotel, but I have visited every floor, both bars and the bathrooms. I also peeped in someones room because they left their drapes open. I must say, the rooms look pretty dope.   Personally, I think the elevator is cool and sure, it was warm, but I most certainly would not complain because you spend fifteen seconds in an elevator.   The rooftop bar is pretty damn awesome. What an amazing view of the city!!! (the bartender isn't bad to look at either, when he is there) We went on a Saturday night and there was a comfortable amount of people. Just make sure you bring a jacket now that it is cooler at night, otherwise you will freeze because it is windy. They just got the heaters in yesterday, so I'm sure they will have those up at any time.   I can't wait to actually stay here so I can update on the rooms and service. Maybe I will meet some hot stud who can wisk me away for an in-town vacay.. the chances of that are pretty slim, so maybe I will just start hanging around the FREAKING AWESOME guys bathroom.. they get to pee into Rolling Stone mouth urinals! What??!?!? (check the pics).   The bathroom is the best part of this hotel.

Well, I FINALLY stayed at the Clarendon this past weekend so I figured it was high time to write an update to my review!   Clarendon is the perfect place for a staycation! The rooms are reasonably priced and with the addition of the Gallo Blanco restaurant, this boutique hotel has everything you need. My room had the most comfortable bed, contemporary decor, a huge flat panel tv and a little fridge!   The pool is fabulous and attracts some pretty awesome looking cats on the weekends. I love that they provide the towels AND the sunscreen :-) During the weekends they also open up the poolside bar where you can get food and beverage service. I love not having to leave the water!   Overall I think Clarendon is pretty amazing and I am stoked to have a new place to lounge on the weekends!

Went here for breakfast this morning and was pleasantly surprised. I had the huevos rancheros. Not as good as Richardsons, but good.  The coffee is strong and the bartender read me very well when he asked if I wanted a shot of Baileys... despite my strong desire to accept, I regretfully declined.  The service is fantastic. My coffee cup was filled up at all times, the food came out quick, etc etc etc  I just want to point out, however, that this place will now be dubbed "AMbers Bad News Breakfast Spot" ... so any time you have bad news to share with me, just invite me to breakfast here so I can be prepared for the onslaught.

What is better than Harley's in the flesh?  Harleys day two!  I normally hate leftovers, but let me tell you, the spaghetti marinara on day two was absolutely amazing!  I have had the Emperor Salad, the marinara and the cheese ravioli. I also had a bite of the gnocchi once. All of the food is extremely flavorful with huge portions. I also think it is reasonably priced. They have a good wine selection; I especially enjoy the Chard.   My favorite item is the tiramisu, though. Oh god is it good. Like a little slice of heaven right on the plate in front of you!  My only complaint about the restaurant is that it is always really hot in there!  Service was good all times, but I did once have a server who was a tad sarcastic.  Overall I really like Harley's and now I am craving some tiramisu!!!

The Vig has DEFINITELY become one of my very favorite spots, so I am doing an update.   You absolutely have to sit out on the patio for the best experience! Especially this time of year (early spring).   Try the artichoke dip and the Alfredo tortellini with a glass of the Kung Fu Girl Riesling. I'm serious. If you don't, you are making the worst mistake of your life!   The service is always friendly and pretty quick. Pam, the manager, is normally bopping around making sure everything is running smooth.   I don't mind walking across the street to park, and it is super cool that they have The Vig Rig ... a free van that will pick you up AND take you home, all for a tip! I have never taken the Rig, but I keep the card handy in my wallet should I ever have an insatiable need to visit the Vig once I am already imbibed. Or without vehicle.   Also, it is worth a trip to the bathrooms. They are really cool and smell so great!

If it is Sunday, I am at The Vig.  I love Sunday at The Vig so much that I made my family come for Easter dinner.  I can get a bottle of my favorite wine (Kung Fu Girl Riesling) for $15 and sit there drinking it all day on the patio whilst listening to covers of songs that my band also covers, except they sound so much better when 1) I'm drunk and 2) The Daelins are playing them.  My only beef is that some of the douchettes that come got my squirt guns taken away. Next time I will just dump water on your head and you will shrivel up like the Wicked Witch of the West.   Also, The Vig is singlehandledly going to fill up my new website: www.uradoosh.com

I was one of the unlucky Phoenicians to experience a long-term power outage as a result of the monsoons, so I needed to take my pooch somewhere to cool off. It just so happened that I remembered Wag N Wash as my list of places to visit.  First of all, a lot of businesses on the 7th ave strip can be hard to get to and find. Wag N Wash was really easy to spot and I had no problem getting into the parking lot.  When we entered, the guys up front were really nice. I decided to get Penny's nails clipped and they took me back and I did not even have to wait. The clipping was $5 and went quick and smooth. No blood :) Boy, it is SO much easier to have someone around to help with nail clippings.  I walked around to look at their selection and was extremely impressed. They had bag and canned foods of all varieties as well as a refrigerator with raw meats and pre-made foods.   Another neat feature was a huge samples table. I have been wanting to try the Wellness brand for a while, and was able to take a pre-packaged sample home to try out.   The owners were extremely knowledgeable about the products and able to make some suggestions about foods for a puppy.  They also had a good selection of pet toys.  I was most impressed with the "bakery" they have up front. They had a variety of homemade dog treats that I could not pass up. They smelled so good I wanted to eat them. Penny is too small to eat the treats unless I break them up into little pieces, but she absolutely loved them.  I was also excited to be added to the discount club.   Overall Wag N Wash was a really good experience and I will definitely be back!

I can only comment on a Monday night because its the only time I have been, but this place seems pretty dang rad!  I'm not a huge football fan, but this bar has an awesome Monday night football thing going on. Every time you buy food/drinks you get a ticket, and every time there is a penalty in the game, they call a number and if your ticket matches you get free food and drinks!  They have a reasonable happy hour and the food is REAL good! I had the spinach artichoke dip and my friends had a variety of wings. Reasonably priced for a sports bar, as well.  They have indoor and outdoor seating so you can do whatever tickles your fancy. Lots of TV's... pretty standard sports bar.  The best part of all is after the Patriots destroyed the Broncos, we got to play BINGO. Yes, I said BINGO!!!! You get two cards per game, and they play three games. Winners got cool glasses, bar towels and cash.  THe only reason I am not giving this place a 5 star rating is because the service wasn't that great. It wasn't awful, but there were definitely lag times between her coming around to our table.  Fun, low key crowd and everyone was fun and lively. I'll definitely be back for Monday night football night!!!!!

I could literally spend an entire day at this 99cents only store. It's clean. They play awesome music. They have pretty much everything and anything your heart desires. Even produce. Yes, I said produce!!  Seriously, I have been to dollar stores a million times, even other 99 cents only, and I really think this is the best dollar store I have ever been to!!  Party supplies, health and beauty items, spices, dry food, frozen food, produce, house cleaners, plates, cups, candles, books, pool toys, candy, cooking instruments, Tupperware, bottled water, diet pills, q-tips, painting supplies, school supplies, batteries... the list goes on and on, and nothing is more than 99 cents.  I would highly recommend hitting the 99 cents only store up prior to Walmart or the grocery store because you can save yourself a ton of loot, and honestly, the products are the same quality because they come from overstock and are actually the same products (most of the time). I know the idea of produce from the dollar store sounds crazy, but its been really good and fresh!!  It's also a cheap way to waste away an afternoon with free A/C!!

When I saw the name "Cornish Pasty" I immediately felt like I needed a peasant dress and a goose following me around in order to visit this establishment. Boy was I wrong; I fit right in with my ripped jeans, straight bangs and tattoos!! The people at this place rawk. (yes, I actually typed the word "rawk")  Anywho, this place is absolutely amazing. They have a whole entire page of veggie creations that make me salivate just thinking about them! I have had the Veggie Mexican (by far the best IMO), the potato and onion and the cottage somethingorother... and oh brother, I loved them all.  I think that the small dining space, worn seats at the bar and the fact that you can see your food being prepared adds to the experience.  My only complaint is that it takes a bit to get your food, but they fill your drinks while you are waiting, so I can deal with it.   They also have Irish Car Bombs. Very cool. Very, very cool.

This was my very first time taking Penny to the dog park and I am SO happy that we chose this park. I read the other reviews on here and the park sounded good, so I thought I would give it a try.  I'm so glad I did because we had such a great time! We ended up sticking around for about two hours and we saw so many different dogs.. puppies to old guys, small to large, pretty much all breeds!  There is a grass, sand and rock area and they a drinking fountain for the pupps. Everyone there obviously loves dogs, so they are all extremely friendly and love talking about their pets so its fun for you and your pup to socialize.  It gets a little busier around 6:30. There were only two owners there when I showed up at 5 and probably 30+ when I left at 7. I thought it was the perfect amount of people and dogs and everyone seemed to be really happy and enjoying themselves.   Me and Penny will be back, weekly, and I would certainly recommend this dog park to anyone!

This is really, really good thai food.  I always get the coconut curry with tofu and have never once been disappointed. I have brought several people there that have always enjoyed.  Lilke most Thai restaurants they close between lunch and dinner, so check the hours before you head out.

I just had to update my review to five stars because this place is THAT good. Seriously.  We now have a new weekly meet up called #ThaiTuesday (or the occasional #ThaiThursday) and I cannot imagine living a week without this delicious treat. In fact, this week I had it Tuesday and Friday. Plus I will be back Monday and then again next Thursday. I guess you could say I am addicted.  This is the first restaurant I have been a "regular" at.. and I love that they know my exact order. Although I am having a splendid love affair with the yellow curry (medium-hot) today I also got the Kao Pad with Tofu... its my new obsession!  The Buddhas delight appetizer is amazing too. Deep fried tofu wedges with a spicy sweet peanut sauce. MMM MmmMMM.  Do yourself a favor and compliment your meal with a pot of jasmine hot tea too!

Sun Asia is not a 5-Star restaurant, but for what it is, I give it 5 stars.   They have probably the best happy hour I have ever seen that lasts from 3pm-7pm then 9pm-Close, and is SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. The HH menu includes single pieces of sushi for $0.99, rolls for $3, and a variety of other fried appetizers for a few bucks (including fried tofu and vegetable dumplings that are vegan friendly) in addition to a ton of cheap ass booze. You can get a sake bomber with Kirin/Kirin Light for $3.85. Beers (domestic and import) are under $2, cocktails are $5, and they even have scorpion bowls!  The staff has been very friendly and quick to answer questions, and the service is always quick.   The decor is totally funky inside, which I personally like. it has a lot of character. They also have a really nice patio that is great for beautiful days and day drinking!  Their regular menu is really expansive and I've only had the kung pao tofu, but it was really good.   They have free delivery with a $25 minimum, but only specific hours. M-F 11a-3p/5p-8p and Sat/Sun 12-8p. You can fax or email your order in too, which I think is pretty cool. Delivery is from 16th ave - 48th street, Broadway to Dobbins.   Thank god we have Sun Asia because there is practically nothing else in South Phoenix. Definitely hit this place up if you are in the area!!!

I say this will all love.. because I know that this place is in a really terrible location so they do everything they can to attract people... but it is just god awful.  First off, you can't find the place. It's in the middle of an industrial area.  Second, they have 20-something girls that couldn't get a job at the strip club wearing next to nothing dancing on the bar. Some of you are probably thinking "hot," but there is a reason why they couldn't get a job at the strip club, if you catch my very obvious drift.  Third, the place is utter chaos. You have a DJ spinning outside, one band playing in the corner of the upstairs area, and generally a metal band playing downstairs, all at ONE TIME. That makes zero sense.  I'm not really sure what else to say other than I don't like this place, and I would probably never go here again.

I love the light rail. I mean, LOVE, the light rail.   First off, it takes me less than 2 minutes to drive to the nearest stop.. 44th and Washington... and when weather permits, I can easily ride a bike there...   Second, it takes me to all of the best places. George and Dragon, Fez, Clarendon, Portland's, Fate, Sens, Amsterdam's, The Embassy, Robert and Bacon's apartment... etc etc etc.   Third, on NYE I was able to take the light rail from my apartment to all of the places I wanted to go, and didn't run the risk of having to drive drunk or spend $20 each way on a cab ride.   I have been on the trains in both Boston and New York and it feels pretty equitable to me. Obviously it is way cleaner, and I hope that the nightly steam cleanings each car will get helps keep it that way.   It has been really busy because it's free, of course, but I really hope that people take the time to give LR a chance. I think it is a really good step in the right direction for us. At the very least, I am excited for it!!

Not only did a drink from this location give one of my co-workers diarrhea for 2 hours straight, but they always make the drinks wrong and act like you are asking them for their first born when you ask them to re-make it.   For $5 my drink better be right damnit!  Go to the location inside the Safeway at 48th Street/Elliot instead unless you want your ass glued to the toilet seat all afternoon.

Wow. I was really shocked at how much I enjoyed Nick's considering it is inside a strip mall! I figured it would be more of a low-key type place, but it was really nice inside and the food was FANTASTIC.   The only complaint I have is that every time someone opened the front door (which was frequent; the place was PACKED) it was absolutely freezing, but the restaurant was able to move us to an area away from the door and the problem was solved!   I started with a glass of Riesling, as usual. I was happy that it was only $5 per glass versus the normal $8, and I was not disappointed with the taste. The busser immediately brought us waters and bread with dipping oil. I could have eaten it all day!!!   I opted for something not even on the menu: Penne pasta with pink sauce (combo of white and red). It was ABSOLUTELY Delicious!!!   The service was great, and I love that our waiter even had an accent!   Overall, I really enjoyed Nicks and will be back for sure!

I am so thankful that Ashley Nails is my neighborhood nail salon! The salon is very clean and in great condition, and they have a ton of regular and gel colors in a range of brands so you can go with basic or pay a $3 upgrade for the high-end Opi Ultralux Gel. They are also great about keeping matching polish and gel so your toes and nails match perfectly.   The best part is the pedicure. They give very good, long massages and if you get a salt scrub or mask the massage time is doubled. I've been to other places where the pedicure isn't any longer when you do an add-on, so I really appreciate the extra TLC. Oh, and they use a new bowl liner for each pedicure so you know that everything is sanitary.   I've been probably 8+ times and have been happy with the quality every single time; both my toes and nails. You do pay about $5/more on average but it's WELL worth the relaxation and quality you get in return!   Highly recommended nail salon.

Cafe Rio used to be right near my work at 48th and Ray, but they moved to Gilbert so I am pretty bummed.  The salads are amazing, and you should DEFINITELY give one a try. They take a fresh homemade tortilla and warm it up, then layer it with veggie friendly beans, fresh lettuce, cheese, etc etc... and it is topped with THE most AMAZING cilantro dressing.   I honestly crave this dressing and really wish that I could find a good bottle of it somewhere.  I cannot attest to the decor or service because I have not visited the area, but I would definitely grab that salad if I were ever in the area.

As far as tanning places go, Sunchain is a pretty up there as far as convenience and value are concerned. I have had the Sunlink membership for a few years and I like the perks and enjoy the salon.   For $24 a month I get unlimited tanning in the regular beds, use of the refresh baskets (lotions, spritzers, etc), CD players and they even have little playboy bunny stickers.  They have really convenient hours and are open 7 days a week. There are also several locations throughout the valley, and your membership will work at any location.   The only reason I do not give 5 stars is because the girls who work at this location are slow and are generally chatting on their cell phones when you walk in.

AZ Bread Company is one of my favorite lunch spots, and not just because it is a mile away from my office.  They have amazing, fresh bread, delicious sides and high quality food.  I normally always get the egg salad on Challah roll, but I have also had the egg salad stuffed tomato in the past. PS, they have amazing egg salad!!  One of my favorite things about this place is the patio seating, especially since it is now fall (I can say that since we have two days in a row at 75 degrees for the high). Also, the interior is fun and brightly colored with a ton of windows making it full of natural light.  The staff is always really friendly and you can often see the owner popping around making sure everyone is happy. I always feel... happy.. when I am here  :)

Have you ever been really drunk off a small amount? Say... one drink? And you feel just absolutely horrible and want to die? Nahh.... me either.  BUT... just in case this DOES happen and you are at, say, The Clubhouse watching a show, you can scoot your bum over to Los Favoritos and have your life saved!  Yummmm does not begin to describe the food. 10x that of any ____bertos. I mean that. (Sorry Julio).  They even put french fries inside Dallas G's burrito. I have never seen him so happy. Ever.  Plus, when I said I was vegan and gf the chick said, well, get a bean taco! Do you know how long it usually takes to explain to someone that I just want a bean taco. No meat. No cheese. Just a bean taco. That's right. Just beans. So major kudos to her for grasping the concept that there are freaks like me in the world who don't eat animal products.  I used to eat their breakfast burritos as well. Their potatoes are fabulous.  Stop what you are doing and go now.

When Richard Z, Dallas G, and Brad E. asked me to join their co-ed soccer team, I thought they were nuts. I can't run. Or kick. Or successfully walk up a flight of stairs without being winded.  Butt.... I soon realized that everyone else playing in the Friday night league was in the same boat, so it made it exponentially more fun!  I like these facilities. They have  two indoor fields, and one outdoor field. There is a snack bar, bleachers all around, and plenty of restrooms. They are pretty low key and the refs are fair.   "Season" two for us Rubber Mallets starts tonight, so if you are looking for a good laugh, come on down and give us a watch!

This is by far the BEST Thai food you can get in Arizona.  The food is amazing. I have tried several different options here including the hot and sour soup, pad Thai, coconut curry with tofu, a noodle dish with egg and basil and a tofu dish with broccoli. I have never ever been disappointed!  The service is really good and quick, and the prices are right on par.  We used to come here for lunch about once a week when I worked closer, and I used to make a second trip with my roommate at least twice a month.   My old boss used to get a Thai Omelet... so if you are into those, you can ask for a special order!  OH YEAH... I forgot, they have window service so you can actually order take out and never get out of your car! It's awesome!

What I am about to say is going to be both hard to believe and incredibly shocking, but true. Completely, utterly, and brutally honest. Ready?  I would rather Z Pizza than any other thing on this planet. More than food, fame, wealth, love, sex, beauty... need I go on?  I have heard some less-than-stellar things about Z Pizza, so I have been giving my business (not THE business) to Pizza Heaven, but one fateful night I took an elevator ride with a Z Pizza delivery man who explained that they have both gluten free crust AND vegan cheese. It was awkward being that I had a Pizza Heaven equivalent literally right in my hand, but the delivery dude handled it with poise and handed me a magnetic business card.  Well, today it is rainy and I'm drunk and I was hungry and I didn't want to drive, so I gave Z Pizza a chance and I am so happy I did because my life changed today.   Let me repeat that: MY LIFE CHANGED TODAY  This pizza, despite it being abnormal in every way possible, was the most delicious culinary specimen I have put in my mouth in MONTHS. Get the Mexican (sans chicken and sour cream, of course)... you owe it to yourself. You really, seriously do.  I love this pizza so much that in future trysts, I will fantasize about this pizza instead of my lover. I really will.  I hate this review because I cannot even articulate the words to do this pizza justice. I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy!  Oh, and PS... when I ordered they told me 45-60 minutes and it was here within 30. That's better than finding a rich guy that dresses well, doesn't have mommy issues, and is straight up hung.   Did I just say that?

I love Southwest. So much so that I should buy stock.  Aside from the fact that I never have time to finish my adult beverage on the way to Vegas before we descend, there is absolutely nothing to complain about.  Cheap, quick and easy. Just the way I like my men.

I have been going to "college" for 11 years now... yet I have no degree. I bet you are wondering how that is even possible.  Maybe, like Van Wilder, I just like being in school (I don't, I hate it).   Maybe I'm dumb.  Maybe I'm desperately trying to prevent my youth from slipping away.   Anyway, back to PVCC. Beautiful campus. Well maintained. Variety of classes at convenient times. Nice professors. Amazing cafe (get the cheesecrisp!!). Overall my fav community college in the valley (and I have been to all of them).  GO PUMAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is the best movie theater in the world. Why? Because nobody ever goes here. More than likely a result of the light rail or people just not wanting to go downtown for a movie. But honestly, only once have I ever gotten a bad seat and it was opening night for the Simpsons and we showed up ten minutes before the show.  Parking validation rules. Their popcorn rules. Their blue icees rule.   Did I mention this was my favorite movie theater?

I grew up going to this Barro's. Granted, it is not the COOLEST looking pizza place ever, but it is by far the best. All the Barro's locations across the valley have amazing pizza!  They have lots of tables and booths; perfect for family pizza parties. They have TV's, normally with sports kicking.. and a play area for kids with a ball pit and video games.   Thick, yummy crust and flavorful cheese. I love to dunk it in the mild wing sauce!  Anyways, Barro's has the best pizza in Arizona, its is really reasonably priced and locations all over... so try them out. You wont regret it!

I have been to this Taco Del Mar once before and went again this weekend, so I felt it was time for a review.  First of all, TDM is a great middle ground between Taco Bell and Chipotle. Its quick and easy, and they have a wide variety of options.  This particular location is pretty cool. The decor inside is fun and it has been very clean both times I have been.  They have veggie options and use lard free beans. I always get the veggie mondo burro and have not been disappointed at all. They are a great size with great flavor.  Another cool thing they have is an iced tea machine. You can select four different tea flavors from the machine, including green tea. They also have a little salsa bar with a few different salsa options and jalapenos.

My very first job ever was working for a bird store called "Chirp and Dales." Very cute, I know. Well, 12 years later, Chirp and Dales has relocated and switched names to Tropic Zone.  My favorite thing about this store is that each of the employees absolutely loves the birds there. They are very knowledgeable, pretty friendly, and very in-tune with the birds needs.   They have a good variety of bulk foods, and a huge selection of toys. They also have grooming items, carriers, cages, perches, and an array of treats. Pretty much anything you need for a bird, Tropic Zone has. They also do boarding ($10-15 a day!!) and grooming.  Today was my fourth or fifth visit to the store, and I made a very special purchase that will ensure I keep coming back. Cotarra is the newest addition to the Williams-Gold family :-)  I forgot to mention that you can bring your winged friend to the store and sit them on the perches attached to the shopping carts! Supppper cute!!  All around A+

i sit here at the rogue west, this very moment, sipping on a $5 a raspberry vodka tonic (they didn't have my regular watermelon) with one thought: I wish I were actually cool enough to be in this bar.   Badbrains is currently playing on the punk rock juke box and twenty-somethings with spikey hair sit at the bar sipping their whiskey.   The camo wearing gentleman next to me just asked if someone crop dusted, which evidentally means fart because he made it clear that it stunk. I personally don't smell anything, but I learned a new phrase.   Evidentally I am being snarky and kind of mean, so maybe I do fit in better than I thought. Next time I feel like being a miserable, snarky bitch I will be back.   Over and out.

(This Portion Is For The Starbucks) Seriously the best customer service I have experienced in the valley, anywhere. The manager of this Starbucks (I believe it is Dominic) is extremely nice, asks questions in a genuine fashion to actually engage you in conversation and is equally friendly with every patron.  They always make the drinks correctly the first time, I get a bonus freebie shot every now-and-again and always leave with a smile on my face.  I will choose this location over the one on Priest/Elliot any day!!  As for the Safeway, they have extremely friendly, helpful staff. Great produce. Huge product offering. Clean store. Quick checkout. No qualms with the grocery store AND they always have book drives and bake sales for muscular dystrophy!  2-for-1!

This is a review for the shooting range.  I'm going to be honest; I have never been so uncomfortable in all my life as when I visited Usury, and that is saying A LOT.   The guys that worked here were completely rude. What, a 5'2" chick with tatts can't shoot at your mountain? I swear, they were looking at me like a black man at a KKK meeting.  I followed the rules every single time I shot, yet the range master felt compelled to YELL at me every time. Honestly? I have a CCW, own my gun and have been shooting since I was like 6. I'm pretty sure I know how to stay behind a line and point the gun at a target.   I won't go here again. There are plenty of other places to give my business to where they won't discriminate.

MAD PROPS to CLubhouse for being one of the only like two all ages venues in the metro area. I absolutely love playing here and its a blast seeing shows here.  There are a few downsides that prevent me from making it a 5 such as the new sound guy and the grungy bathrooms, but overall this place is dizope!

Kristi D just reminded me that I love Yucca  :)  Great local music spot, espcially because there is no cover charge!  Only reason I am not giving this place 5 starts is because it is SOOOOO loud and normally takes forever to get something from the bar.

I don't know how anyone can hate on a place that serves beer out of a glass boot.  I have only been here once on a Friday, but I have some friends that come here on a weekly basis. They have an amazing band that plays on Friday, and it is so much fun to go, grab a drink and hang out on the dance floor.

Oh baby... oh, baby baby...  The Original Burrito Co is 100% amazing. #12 breakfast burrito. The Veggie Mixito. The cheese quesedilla. The tostada.  Oh, and how can you go wrong with a salsa bar?!? YUMMMM!  I have an affinity for pay-at-the-counter mexican restaurants, and this one takes the cake.

Despite the fact that they tell you their beans are vegetarian, and put them in the vegetarian burrito, The Original Burrito Company makes their beans with CHICKEN STOCK.   This is false information they are providing to people, and when people have moral issues with consuming meat, this turns into a huge issue.  I will never eat here again. I do not support businesses that are dishonest.

II was nervous about going to Sundrops because of the mixed reviews, but I am SO happy I did!!!  I called and got an appointment twenty minutes later. I did have to wait for about 10-20 minutes when I got there, but the environment was pleasant and they offered me tea and water while I waited, which you would never find at your standard corner nail salon.  The decor was so awesome! They have cute clothes, shoes and home products to look at while you are waiting. The actual mani/pedi areas are bars (you can see the pics on their website) so your not stuck in a whirlpool chair. I just totally loved the 50's style decor and the awesome old movies they had playing. If you like Audrey Hepburn, you will be in heaven!  My mani and pedi were both exceptional, and my technician was super friendly and talkative. She made sure she wasn't hurting me as she did the different treatments.  It is a little pricey... I think the mani/pedi was $57 total, but I was treated with respect and really enjoyed the environment. I'm so sick of going to nail salons where they barely speak English and they are super rude to me.  I will be back many times :)

I have to be honest; I found Thai Hut average at BEST. I may not be an expert, but Thai is my favorite food (I eat it at least once a week) and I recently spent 10 days in Thailand, so I have had my fair share and I certainly know a good meal when one is put in front of me... and no such thing happened here at Thai Hut.   My food and my hot tea were lukewarm-bordering-on-cold, the flavor in the Tom Kah soup was minimal and completely overpowered by the chili flakes they put on the top (fist time I have ever seen that) and the yellow curry, while traditional, left a lot to be desired in both the taste and the consistency (very soupy).  The service was okay, but certainly not friendly. I actually even felt uncomfortable at times.  With all the other Thai places in the area (Thai Elephant, Wild Thaiger, Thai Basil) I have no reason to make it back to Thai Hut.   Sowwweeee!

OK, I'm sure I am going to get flack for this, but I really like going to Tempe Marketplace.  We are not a city like New York or Boston where we have shops and restaurants intertwined with the city. We have shopping plazas and the types of retailers that prevail are corporate chains.   Personally I enjoy being able to get a shit load of shopping done in one place. I get pick up stuff for the pooch at Petsmart, get my household items at Target, grab an extra throw pillow at Linens and Things, check out the deals at Ross, grab lunch at one of the many places they have to eat, grab some new bras and panties at Victoria's Secret, check out the latest blockbuster at the movie theater, buy new sunglasses at one of the few sunglass shops, get funky with some new tights from Hot Topic and get some comfy PJ's at Gap Body all while sucking down an iced coffee from Starbucks watching one of the many free live bands they have playing on the weekends.  I'm not sure whats wrong with any of that?  I agree, parking is a pain, but can you imagine how much worse it would be to have to park, go into any one of those stores, then get back in your car, drive to your next destination, park, shop, return to your car, drive to the next destination.... wash, rinse, repeat.  This place gets a bad wrap, but I love it and I'm stickin to that.

So... where are all the slot machines, poker tables and cocktail waitresses? I swear I just walked into a hotel restaurant off of the Vegas Strip... not even keno at the table. What??   No, wait... where are the 4,000 flavors of cheesecake? This IS the Cheesecake Factory, right??? No???   Okay, Grand Lux Cafe is so confusing. I think it is going through an identity crisis because it looks like a cross between a casino hotel lobby and The Cheesecake Factory, but without any personality.   For dinner on a Wednesday night, in this great of a location, I was shocked to see this place so empty. Maybe everyone was across the street at Pink Taco. Or, maybe people just do not like being served by a wait staff with a perma-fake smile on their face all night.   The one thing I will say for GLC is they have a LOT of options. However, I find restaurants that provide such a variety generally have anything exceptional to offer as far as the meal is concerned. I believe this is true for this establishment, as well.   The waitress recommended the Vegetarian Chopped Salad saying she thought it was the best thing on the menu. I found it to be pretty bland and uninspiring. I guess I'm spoiled by the Cowboy Ciao Chopped Salad. But I digress.   I would have gotten the tofu dish they have (orange glaze with sesame seeds, I believe) but I was informed that they cook it with a fish sauce. At least the waitress knew it was a non-veggie friendly option, but why serve a tofu dish that is not veggie?   My dinner date ordered the BLT with fries. I think she ate about five bites and a couple of fries. She was equally unimpressed. I snuck a fry and they certainly are nothing to write home about. Limp and soggy, just the way nobody likes em.   They did have a good Riesling a good selection of coffee drinks as well as an expansive dessert menu. We did not try a dessert (they have baked items that take about 30 minutes to cook.. probably pretty good, but I'm on a diet) but my gal pal did order a Mocha Coffee which she seemed relatively pleased with.   We ended up sitting around chatting for 3.5 hours and they never kicked us out or made us feel bad about not ordering anything else, so I would give them an extra half star if I could (Gabi, are we EVER going to get half stars?!?!?).   Grand Lux ... I am going to sum you up into one word: Uninspiring

If you are a fan of the Bikini, this is probably the best thing that has ever happened to you. They will deliver. Right to Bikini. You can drink your $4 pitcher of hooch whilst scarfing down some deliciousness!  I happened to cruise by here on my bitchin bike on my way to Bikini this Saturday to support the Grand Avenue Festival. I was litterally brought to tears at the convenience of this location.  After imbibing for a while I walked back over to find the coolest, sweetest group of people. The owner was the order taker, and it is obvious how passionate she is about her business.  We ended up with the garlic bread, a cheese pizza, a Philly Cheese steak and a veggie sub for $23. How this is possible, I do not know.  UN  FREAKING  BELIEVABLE  Man was this food good! Seriously! The cheese on the veggie sub was so tasty and the crust was scrumptious.   I was also stoked to hear that they were considering putting in an extra oven to make gluten free pizza and were also considering vegan cheese! They even asked what a good brand was!  A+ Customer Service A+ Location A+ Prices A+ Food  Hellllssss yeah! #NewFavoritePlace  (PS - the review from Michael S was from the previous pizza place. This was closed, someone new bought it, redid everything and this is a brand new place)

Never have I ever had a craving as much as the soy coconut latte's they make in a clutch the donuts are vegan but I cannot eat them because my stomach hates gluten a touch.  They carry cool clothes and crowds come in droves on First Friday where their location is key.  This poem doesn't really rhyme I hope you don't mind, a true poet I never will be  But I do like to bake so watch out for my vegan cakes Conspire, please buy them from me  Sure the baristas are hippies and its not always quickie but the taste is delicious perhaps even nutritious Conspire you've sure got MY vote

One time, before we became "official," I walked into a UYE at Bomberos and gave Dallas G a high five. That's right, instead of a hug or kiss on the cheek for the man who had graced the sheets of my bed many a times, he gets a high five. It was awkward. Realllllyyyy awkward.   I'm so smooth....   So, thank god Bomberos has such a dope wine list and attentive service, because I most definitely needed the Chilean Riesling to take off the edge of that massacre!  They have an amazing bruschetta plate, a tasty breakfast wrap, perfectly brewed Illy coffees and they even let me bring in my own cake when it was Chrissy P's surprise party!  The patio is amazing whether you want to lounge out on a Sunday morning and read a book on the comfy patio furniture or sit with a romantic date by the fire. I also hear that they have free wifi. Score!  Winner!! (Unlike me, who gives awkward high 5's!!!)

If you like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain ... if you're not into yoga, and you have half a brain ....  DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE  If you are a middle aged individual who wants to hit the dance floor and show off your tired dance moves to Beyonce and Chris Brown on a Saturday night while paying $11.50 for a vodka redbull, then this is the place for you!  I love Jimmy Buffet and I love the Margaritaville in Vegas, but this place somehow derailed miserably.

Dally G and myself hit up this S.A. once so we could get some stability balls as our office chairs. According to Bob and Jillian (Biggest Loser) it is a great way to passively work your core.  Well. This is where I met the most pathological liar I have ever encountered; a title previously reserved for my ex husband. This 21 year old decided that his degree from Notre Dame Law School wasn't going to do him any good, so he relocated to AZ to come work at Sports Authority for minimum wage. BTW, he went to Notre Dame on sports scholarship. Mmmmhmmmm.  Anyway, this crazy lunatic tried to sell me a warranty on my stability ball (that cost $19.99 btw) telling me that I could call the corporate office and tell them it "popped" and they would send me a new one. FYI, this isn't true.  Also, they have THE worst bathrooms on the planet and are overpriced.

Two stars for Temple should be extreme flattery.  I just want to remind everyone that as of Tuesday night, we are still in a recession. People are looking for work, companies are going out of business left and right, middle class families are living on the street. What does this mean, you ask?  Well, it means if I come into your eating and drinking establishment with fifteen others, you should be excited that your damn bar is getting business and that you will walk out with some cash in your pocket.  Is that what happened? No  We got terrible service. Our waitress was really snappy and rude, complaining before we even sat down about splitting checks. She took a few orders first and then came back later to take the rest while informing us that they were no longer serving food. If she would have said that in the beginning, maybe everyone would have had a chance to order before the kitchen closed.  The "smothered" tater tots were basically just sprinkled with cheese.  This was a huge disappointment because I love cheese.  The only redeeming thing about this place was the fact that they had good reverse happy hour specials.  Temple - if you want repeat customers, treat them a little better. Especially since you are in WAY northeast Scottsdale and people are not just going to accidentally run into you.

While I am no Thai expert, I do eat Thai food a lot, and I can speak a little bit, and I'll be going to Thailand in December, so I think it stands to reason that I know what I'm talking about.  Thai Elephant is delicious. Tom Kah with Tofu. Drunken Noodles with Tofu. Drunken Fried Rice with Tofu. Yellow Curry with Tofu. Siamese Basil with Tofu. All amazing.  I have been to the Tempe location probably 20 times, and I like it better because 1) I don't have to feed the meter like at this downtown location 2) the facilities are a little nicer 3) its bigger and 4) the service is a little better, but overall this location is pretty good.  Cob Coon, Ka for reading!

This is my FAVORITE Mac location in the world.   They always have everything I need in stock, and the staff members are always super friendly and willing to help out. I have shopped here probably ten or twelve times and have had the same, positive experience each time. I'm glad they moved to a bigger store... means more products available for me to buy :)  My only dislike is that it is in the Biltmore Fashion Park, so parking can be a bitch, but if you are going there anyways its the perfect time to stop by and pick up some Mac!

I was lucky enough to sneak away from work for December Yelp Office Hours and got the chance to hang out with some fellow Yelpers at Cartel. I fell in love with this place the moment I walked in.   The decor is awesome. They have a ton of random stuff popping about, and the wide-open industrial looking space is surprisingly comfortable.   They fresh brew every cup, so you have THE best possible cup of coffee you can get. Normally I opt for something fancy schmancy like a non-fat, 5 pump gingerbread latte when I hit up coffee joints, but something told me a good ol black Guatemalan cup would serve me well.. and I was correct!   I am an AVID coffee drinker. I mean AVID. The Guatemalan coffee, straight-up, with no sugar, syrup, cream, etc... was THE, and I mean THE, best cup of coffee I have EVER had. Hands Down.   I have since been back twice and the coffee is consistently good. In the future I hope I can try something else, but why mess with perfection????

This place is absolutely, positively perfect in every conceivable way. Why, you ask, is this place perfect in every conceivable way? Well... my friends... let me tell you.  1. Big Kahuna Cab/Shiraz Mix Wine - it costs three dollars and it is good. Like, I drink it all the time good. THREE DOLLARS!  2. Cilantro Lime Hummus - You could dip paper in this and it would still be nectar of the gods. Still.  3. No Bullshit Approach - You walk in, you get your shit, and you check yourself out. I'm not anti-social, but I really don't like dealing with people, so this is perfect for me.  4. They have exactly what you need, and nothing more.   5. The clearance section is abundant. I'm a cheap bastard; what can I say?  6. This F&E is literally 2 minutes from my house. They close at 10pm, so when you are baking #ThePie (VEGAN STYLE RICHARD!!!!) at 9:55pm at night and realize you are out of pecans, you can scoot on over, grab your nuts, and be back home by 10:01pm.  7. Ummm... duh, its Fresh and its Easy.

If you want to be yelled at for trying to get a bite to eat late night, come on over to "Best of Italy" where the motto is "Treat the customers like shit and make them suffer for all of our bad life choices"  I understand that we popped into your pizza shop (located at the mecca of late night drinking - S Scottsdale) later than you wanted to be there, but you kept the door open, the open sign on and agreed to serve us and the other people in there pizza, so I don't want to hear how you have "been here since 9am."  I literally got yelled at by the owner for trying to spend my money at this place, and the $3 I paid for the cold, lifeless pizza was $3 too much because it was awful, had obviously just been hanging around for hours and literally made me feel like I was digesting razor blades.  Do yourself a favor and hit up Denny's or Philladelphia Sandwich Company instead... they may not serve pizza but I'm certain that they appreciate your business and won't treat you like crap.

I have never really been a fan of public masturbation, but then again, I had never been to Geisha A Go Go's restrooms before either. Ladies, they have an osculating bidet that has front and back controls.......  There was a large (and excessively rowdy) group of us in one of the private Karaoke rooms celebrating Nathan S's 35th birthday this  past Saturday and I gotta say, I had a damn blast. We sang Love Shack and Sweet Caroline and Careless Wisperer. I even did an inappropriate duet to "Like A Virgin."  Oh, and those pear vodka champagne drink things?? I unknowingly sucked down 6 of them. Thanks to Georgie S for making sure it was Grey Goose. Anyway, sure I paid $54, but I was seriously having the best drunken blast and I felt like I hadn't touched a drop the next morning.  So, the waitress fucking hated us, but we had a g-damned blast. A BLAST. We twirled on poles, sang horrifically at the top of our lungs and probably contracted some diseases from the booths and carpets, but whatevs, it was a blast!  And P.S... I never actually used the bidet.... really... for more than a second

Being a vegetarian I did not think Charleston's would have much for me. It turns out that I was right, HOWEVER, what they did have for me was actually very simple but amazing!  I had a business meeting today with a vendor and my biz partner. We all shared the spinach artichoke dip, which was super tasty and a great portion size. The chips were nice, warm and fresh and the dip came with salsa and sour cream on the side.  I had a house salad sans the bacon plus avocado for my entree and a baked potato on the side. I opted for the creamy garlic dressing and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! The salad was fresh with egg, carrots and chopped tomato and the avocado made a nice addition.  They cover their potatoes in sea salt.. its pure genius. I'm serious. Genius. All I needed was a little butter and sour cream and I was set.  Our waitress was very attentive but not super friendly. She had a new iced tea out to me before I was halfway done with the one I was currently drinking. Great service but I have had to make five trips to the bathroom since.  This is a pretty good place for a business lunch but I wouldn't come here outside of that because I normally like something a little heavier for dinner and its a tad on the pricey side, but hey, I didn't pay so what do I care?

GFC is absolutely a heaven sent treat from above!  For those of us with gluten intolerance, it is incredibly difficult to find bread, bagels, pizza dough, pastries, etc that do not have the fateful binding agent, but wonderful places like GFC save the day!  They are located behind an auto oil changing shop (I think Midas) at 30th street and Thomas. They close at 5pm during the week, but if you call them and let them know you are on the way, they will wait around for you! Nice service!  I'm vegan so I am limited with all the items I can try, but I can tell you the vegan gluten free chocolate chip cookies are amazing AND loved by regular eaters. I don't think Brad E could get enough!  This time around I also discovered they have veggie burgers in buns! You can throw them in the microwave, but I put mine on the grill twice; both the buns and the patty. DELICIOUS!  I love the onion bagels, especially with some vegan cream cheese! I also really enjoy the herb baguettes.  Really cool news is that they just purchases Lulu's Cupcakes, so they will be opening in about a week (McDowell and Miller) with a small deli where they make sandwiches and they will have a retail area where you can get products from the bakery!  Really really amazing place that I am incredibly thankful for!  Oh, and if you live by Luci's (16th St and Bethany) they carry GFC items there too!

I was really impressed with Il Posto, especially after all of the mediocre reviews. My favorite Yelper, Christina P, put together a UYE here last night, and the event could not have been more perfect.  The bartender and staff were really friendly and made us feel very welcome. They have a fantastic patio with a fire pit in the middle which made for a perfect happy hour setting.  We happened to be there on the night they unveiled their specialty pizza line. I had the pleasure of trying both the margharita and the goat cheese & onion, both of which I thought were fantastic. They also serve bread with a cheesy pesto dipping sauce that was to die for.  Our group ending up trying a lot of different pizza's and everyone seemed to really enjoy.  I was pleased with their happy hour specials ($2 off specialty pizzas; $1 off appetizers, well drinks, house wines and draft beers) and especially pleased that they extended those specials for our group for the entire time we were there.  This is another time I wish we could give 1/2 stars because I would give Il Posto a 4.5... and I will definitely be back to grab another glass of the Chateau Ste. Michelle Riesling and snack on one of those delish speciality pizza's on the patio!

I feel like a big fat jerk for not writing this glowing review of Lady Luck and Uncle Josh sooner. Someone should stick me with tiny needles :-p  Per the recommendation of Amy D, I went to see U.J. last summer for a full back piece I wanted done. I had some ideas and I handed them over. Two weeks later I went back and Josh had whipped them up into a spectacular visual demonstration. I was super stoked to get working.  The tattoo took over a year to complete, which was completely my fault, but I loved every minute of the 15+ hours we put into it. Each time I went, Josh was incredibly friendly, professional, and dedicated to his craft.   The rest of the staff is really friendly, and supportive of the other artists. They come over to each others booths to check out work and give props versus being snide or competitive, which I have seen in many studios.  I couldn't be happier with the outcome of my tattoo, and the quality, healing times, instruction were absolutely perfect. This was my 9th tattoo, and it was the best by far. Highly Recommended.

For the most part I am extremely detail oriented and rarely make mistakes when managing a project. With that said, I sat there on a Wednesday morning looking through our upcoming move into our office suite that Friday afternoon just to make sure I crossed my "T's" and dotted my "I's" ... when suddenly I realized: SHIT, I forgot to book the movers!!!   Sooooo... I turn to trusty Yelp to guide me to a moving company that can hopefully be my knight in shining armour and give a call to Camelback Moving.   They were able to accommodate our move with extremely short notice and we were so happy with the service. The two guys that came were extremely friendly, they got right down to business and did not waste any time. Our move went really quickly and I was extremely satisfied with the price. They clearly disclose pricing on their website and I had no issues after-the-fact.   I would highly recommend Camelback Moving and will certainly use them the next time I have a move! Thanks for saving the day!!

Since my last review in 2009, I have used Camelback Movers an additional two times (with two different crews) and have been equally as happy as the first time I used them. Always professional, hard working, and very careful with your items. I've never had a single item damaged. Very competitive pricing. Highly recommended.

The people who patronize this establishment are the kind of people that bring their babies and/or children to the bar on Friday night.   Just stop and think about that for a moment.  You have a baby.................. in a bar???  To add insult to injury, the Chupacabra margarita tastes like dirty, soapy ass. How dare they insult my precious X Files by naming this horrific drink after the mystical character that Fox and Dana chased after in one of my favorite episodes ever? Blasphemy.   Finally, I will close this review with the tweet I sent whilst using the ladies restroom (yes, I tweet and pee at the same time):  "If you are ever looking for a dirty, sloppy, drunken lay then head to the womens restroom at salty senorita peoria"   Oh, PS... Thanks to Andrew K I just realized I missed the most important text of the night:  "I'm too drunk to be alive. Sincerely, in hell in Peoria"

I was pretty impressed with Fresh Mint. It is not the best Veggie food I have ever had and the service left a little to be desired, but I enjoyed my meal and the decor of the restaurant.  I ended up having the carmelized fish and my boyfriend had the kung pow chicken. Both were flavorful and cooked perfectly. I had jamsmine iced tea and was never offered a refill, which sucked, because it was really good.  Oh, yeah, we started off with the Pho which was really really good. It had fake beef in it and was sweeter then normal Pho but was really really tasty. I would go back just for the soup.  The bathrooms were really nice. That normally doesnt matter to people but i really liked them so I figured I would point it out  Overall it was a good experience and I will definitely be back. There were a lot of different dishes I wanted to try, especially after all of the comments about the chicken being so good.

There are two things that keep Maizie's from being five star in my book:  1 - It is so warm that I felt like I was having early onset menopause 2 - They are in an unfortunate location if you are going northbound on Central, because you have to flip a biatch  Here are the things that make Maizie's pretty awesome:  1 - $3 Burger Night Monday 2 - $3 Beers during HH 3 - $5 Bruschetta (that is freaking amazing) 4 - Awesome bathroom with tasty smelling orange lotion 5 - Cool looking bar 6 - Big, open windows 7 - Cool Aesthetics 8 - Kung Fu Girl Riesling 9 - Friendly, accommodating staff (especially for our large party) 10- Lot's of options for everything: Food, Wine, Beer  I really liked Maizie's a lot and I cannot wait to be back :)

I don't consider Bombay Spice an authentic Indian Restaurant; more of a modern and healthier version of the Indian cuisine. I appreciate their healthy take and their vast vegan and gluten free options.  I have been to Bombay about five or six times over the course of the last year, and have eaten some of their items at Yelp events. I have never disliked any of the items I have tried, but there have certainly been a few items I found less than flavorful (vegetable lentil soup, cauliflower, spicy veggie curry).  Last week I tried the seared tofu, and it was absolutely amazing. It is an appetizer, but comes with five or six good sized slices of tofu, and I would eat it as a meal. I also fell in love with the DELICIOUS tofu masala. I couldn't be happier with either of those selections and highly recommend them.   I also like that you get to choose two menu items and have it served in a variety of ways (plated with rice, lettuce wraps, roti taco, etc). It gives a little extra variety depending on your mood.   One complaint I have is that they do not know which wines are vegan. To have a separate menu focusing on vegan entrees and to not know what complimentary drinks are also vegan leaves me a little dissatisfied.  Overall, Bombay has good service, a good location next to Whole Foods, progressive menu items, is moderately priced, and has a good variety of items available for vegans and carnivores alike.

I had a really hard time deciding between 4 and 5 and I decided to go with 5 because for the first time in my life, I ate my leftovers  :)  First of all, this place is completely unexpected. Being next to a ghetto Circle K in a not-so-good part of town, I was not expecting the high quality of food and service that we received. Needless to say, I was really impressed.  We started with the Margharita pizza and I must say, I have not had better. That is surprising because I ate pizza twice in New York in August.  For my entree I had the spaghetti pomodoro. Normally I prefer a capellini pasta with this type of sauce, but I was really impressed. Honestly, I wanted to just sit and smell it all night long!  We were so stuffed after the pizza/entree, but Michael insisted (heavily) that we try the tiramisu. It was DIVINE! Normally I would be angry at a server for forcing me to order something I didn't want, but I will excuse him this time.  I really like how proud they are that they make everything from scratch, fresh. Even the desserts. I am also excited that they are opening up an additional location in Scottsdale!  On a side note, they have REALLY cute plates and bowls!!  :)   I cannot believe it took me this long to get to Pizza A Metro, especially since it is the first place I ever bookmarked on Yelp!  I will be back. Many, many times!

Ring Ring....  "Good Morning, 24 Carrots, This is Sasha... how can I help you?"  Me: "What is your soup today?"  Sasha: "Well, I haven't made it yet; what sounds good to you?"  WHAT! A business owner actually asking her customers what THEY want??? Incredible! What is even more incredible is that Sasha put up with my continuing barrage of questions, emailed me the most updated menu, and allowed me to order through email since 11 of us at the office wanted to give 24 Carrots a try.  Sasha did an amazing job of meeting our needs, and even labeled each of the to-go boxes and smoothies with our names!   The greens and beans soup was OUT OF THIS WORLD, and I fell in LOVE with the "Triple Threat Acai" smoothie... so much so that I got it again the second day! I also got to try the black bean burger on a bed of greens and the masala burger. I really love that you get either baby carrots or corn chips with your sandwich!  Everything is from local farmers markets and cooked to order. You can taste the quality in the food. I also really love that everything is pretty much vegan, and any cheese is added on after the fact.  In addition to the black bean and masala burgers, the pita pizza's were also a really huge hit with my co-workers.  A+++ all around!!

Since my original review I have also had the Mediterannean Bean Salad (which is SO FREAKING GOOD), the mashed potato soup, and we tried some raw items on a Friday. The cookies were divine, the almond milk drink Sasha makes is incredibly creamy and delicious, and the peanut spring rolls are very fresh and flavorful. I was not the biggest fan of the "porcini scallops" but I don't like mushrooms... other members of the group enjoyed them!   The actual restaurant is really cute and cozy, and I love the sayings written all over the walls.

In order to get a full scope of what Sasha has to offer, you need to pop in to 24 Carrots at least 3 or 4 times because there are so  many amazing things to try, you cannot get it all in a visit!  Here are some of the major highlights:   1. Every day they make a homemade soup from scratch, and every single day it is amazing. The mashed potato, split pea, tomato basil, tortilla, and beans and greens are all DELICIOUS!  2. The hummus is like out of this world good. It has an airy, fluffy quality to it and they will give you extra veggies instead of pita if you can't eat gluten.  3. Sasha takes emailed orders,  updates her specials on the FaceBook page daily, and regularly interacts with her customers online.   4. The Food: Mediterranean Bean Salad, Chipotle Tofu Scrambler Tacos, Summer Fruit Crumbler, GF Pasta Salad, Veggie Marsala Burgers w/ Jalapeno Cilantro Pesto ... I could go on, and on, and on....   I'm so stoked that she listens to her customers and is extending hours, adding new menu items (BLT!!!), and considering doing delivery!   Whether you are vegetarian, vegan, laden with food allergies, or a regular Joe schmo.... there is something delicious waiting for you at 24C!

I love Red Robin. It's an amazing place and I have rated other locations a 5, but this location only gets a 4 because I went there today and was FREEZING the whole time. I was so uncomfortable.  The food was amazingly tasty as usual and all five of us were really happy with the meal and the service, it was just way way too cold.   I would definitely recommend heading here for one of the many awesome gourmet burgers or the fiesta fajita salad, but BRING A JACKET!!!!!!!!!

I'm not sure when this place opened, but I cannot believe it took me this long to get here!  They have a TON of vegan options and several gluten-free options which make them hella-rad in my book!   This is a pay-at-the-counter-and-eat-off-of-paper-plates type of place, which is fine by me because it keeps the costs down and the portions large!  I had the gobi manchurian (SO AMAZING) and the spiced rice. My dining partner had one of the platters and she was loving every bit of it.  I will be back... watch out!

I thought I loved Port of Subs, but I was wrong.  I currently sit eating the Vegetarian sub (3rd time I have had it) and I am super disappointed. The bread is really dry, despite the fact that I have oil, vinegar and mayo on it, and it is pretty tasteless.  The cheese is good and the fact that you have multiple size options is cool, but the sandwich is really blah and unimpressive.   Blimpie, Cousins or Subway are all way better. ... but if you are over in this area go to Lee's Sandwiches on Dobson/Warner instead. It's worth the 5 mile drive.

This place rocks. If I wasn't on a temporary, self-imposed rehab binge, I would be here every night. Especially Friday.   I walked into the bar and they have Star Trek mannequins. Um... hells ya!   I walked up to the bar and ordered myself a $1 alien slime shot (Hard core vodka jello shot with 7-up) and got MESSED UP.   I walked into the bathroom and guess what - they are unisex!   I walked back to the bar and ordered myself another $1 alien slime shot whilst I was serenaded by the amazingly gay lounge duo.   And most importantly, I found out that I too was gay. The lovely lady lounge singer used her gaydar machine and that thing practically blew up.   Sorry Dally.   There is nothing wrong with this bar.

If you love a place so much that you eat it for lunch two days in a row, and upon finishing your second lunch you question whether you should go there for dinner, or just wait for lunch tomorrow, the place deserves five stars.  As others have mentioned, they are a little pricier than other Thai places around the valley, but the lunch tofu dishes are $7.95 and come with an egg roll and vegan hot & sour soup, and it is well worth it.  I'm one of those fat kids in a skinny-ish body, because I will eat every last bite on the plate in front of me. Generally the portions at Thai places are so huge I feel like a whale after I leave, but Thai Elephant does a good job with their potion sizes (at least for lunch) leaving me satisfied but not feeling glutenous.   I need someone to provide me some damn control, because I have none :-p  Quick, friendly service. Clean, comfy interior. No complaints.   Try the Siamese Basil or Drunken Noodles with Tofu. Both are amazing. Unless you want to crap fire, I suggest getting nothing spicier than medium. Enjoy the visual!!

It's interesting seeing some of the reviews on here. You would think Curry Leaf was trying to present itself as an upscale Indian food restaurant in a hugely desirable area.   Curry Leaf shares a strip mall with a dry cleaners, taco bell, AZ Hair Co and Chuck E Cheese. It's a small place with tables to eat in, but I imagine most of their business is takeout or the newly available delivery.   Jeff P mentions "It just sees as if some random Auntie and Uncle decided to lease a space and start cooking fast food versions of Indian food" ... first of all, I disagree with this, and second, isn't America founded on the entrepreneurial spirit that promotes local owned businesses?!?   Curry Leaf is owned by a husband/wife duo and I was super stoked at how nice the husband was. He answered my questions without prejudice which is rare for me in other Indian establishments. While I waited for my food, we chatted about their business, my business and other random chit chat. As I was leaving, another gentleman came in and the husband sang out "Hey Bob, how are you doing today?!?" It's nice to see that customer service and appreciation are still alive these days.   I ordered the Channa Masala bowl with Basmati Rice and a side of Cumin Potatoes and I was really impressed. The flavor in both dishes was great and had just a little tinge of spicyness. The portions were great and for the price of $4.99 I think an excellent value (Lunch price is $4.99; regularly $6.99).   There are also a couple of really neat things that make this place stand out: They offer deliver and TEXT IN service... so you can actually text them your order for pickup! I think that is such a cool idea. You are texting directly to the husbands phone, and then he saves your number so that in the future he knows that its you. I'm pretty sure he remembers every customer.   The bowls that they use for takeout are very durable and can be used again as Tupperware. I think this is a super cool idea and adds a little value.   In a world where we are cattle prodded through life eating out of Styrofoam containers in our cars, I believe Curry Leaf has made an attempt to add value to their product and I for one am both impressed and inspired and look forward to a new weekly lunch spot!

Healing Touch is AMAZING.  I have been to several massage parlors in the valley and other states, and have never had as good of an experience as I have had at Healing Touch.  I found them on azspagirls.com and they were having a special, so I decided to try it out. I was so impressed with the experience.  First, the decor is awesome. You walk in and everything is Hawaiian themed. And not tacky. You start by getting special slippers then undress and change into a robe. After you are changed you head into a private waiting area that has a waterfall and treats and drinks.   All of the therapists are completely professional and do an amazing job. They are seasoned, so you wont have to worry about someone fresh out of college working on you.  I have had the Oahu Relaxation Massage, the Honu and the Lymphatic Drainage and I enjoyed all three. The last time I did a couples massage. Basically you can do one of the couples packages, or you and your significant other can just pick the massage you want and get them in the same room.  After the massage you can take a shower in the waterfall room. It has a huge rain head and four jets that make it an awesome experience. Very relaxing!  I would highly recommend heading out here. It's a little out of the way being at 116th street and Shea, but I drive over 30 minutes to get here at least once per month.   They have a monthly membership program, similar to Massage Envy, where you pay $39 per month and get a massage. You can upgrade to any of their massages, facials or wraps and you get a $59 credit. They have REALLY REALLY reasonable prices, as well.  Very clean, professional but relaxing environment.  Also, the owners recently went to Hawaii for a few weeks and actually sent a hand written post card to all of their members. I find this personal touch to be a really awesome thing.  Oh - they have really good hours too, and you can book your appointment online really easily.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Since my original review, I have been back to Healing Touch/ Hawaiian Experience Spa several times and have been extremely impressed every time.  I have switched exclusively to Steve (the owner) because he gives the best massages I have ever had. Hands down. Two experiences ago he made it a point to discuss my upper back and recommend a neuro-muscular massage to help get the tension out. I agreed and was so happy I did. Since that massage I have had far more neck mobility and generally feel less stressed!!  I am really excited that they are now open on Monday and Tuesday (which was my only complaint before) and am excited to get a facial with their new aesthetician!

If you are in the mood for a smoothie, this is the best smoothie place I have ever been. They have a huge variety including low fat at low carb smoothies.  I normally get a cranberry smoothie anywhere I go and end up getting heartburn. I get the cranberry crush smoothie at TSC and its very mild. I absolutely love it.  I have never actually been into the cafe before, so I cannot comment on the service or decor. I always send my assistant :)  The only reason I am giving this a 4 is because the food they serve is pretty average. Also, if you order fruit for a side, you literally get a piece of fruit. I ordered a veggie wrap one day and ended up with a whole orange, unpeeled, as my side. Kind of weird.

Collin S. will hate me for writing this review now that he is a taxi driver for a competing company, but I have to be honest, VIP Taxi is pretty AMAZING.  Their online service is so incredibly convenient, and allows you to check rates, schedule pickups and trips, sends you text and email reminders, and they have a re-loadable card that you can use in place of cash/credit and for every $50 you load they give you a 10% bonus on your card! You can even order a taxi by text!   They have always been on time, professional, and ask if you prefer highway or surface streets.

Sondra is a Saint. With Scissors. She will whip your hair into a magical masterpiece whilst lavishing you with red wine and praise. Can you ask for more?  Well, I will give you more. I'm generally not too into "eye candy," but I was literally texting every woman I know to tell them I had landed square in the center of Hunk Central. Pre-Wine :-)  Sondra did the hair for my besties wedding in March, and I fell in love with her then. I recently saw her again at a hair show and decided to hop in for a cut and color. She talked me into some fun purple panels and hooked me up with a bitchin style for a night on the town.  Danielle is also rockin too, and does kick ass makeup!  Amazing laid-back funky fun time!

I have an addictive personality (shocker, I know) so when I hopped up on the proverbial "wagon," I immediate sought out the quickest replacement I could find. Unfortunately, while skilled in the art of boozing, I am no tea aficionado and have been drinking bagged tea I got for $1.99 at WalMart. (I am sorry, Julia T, on so many levels)  The other day I happened to be trolling around The Biltmore infecting people with my excessively shiny good mood when I happened across Teavana and the lovely ladies out front providing samples of their Jasmine Dragon tea.   Until this moment, I refused to believe that loose leaf tea could be that much better than the bagged tea, but let me tell you, I. WAS. WRONG. That is right, I am admitting, perhaps for the first time ever, that I was wrong about something.  I did not like having to spend $7 on my Teavana container (which is why I am docking one star) but I didn't mind the other $25 I spent on the tea because, let's just be honest, it is fucking delicious. And cheaper than booze.   To cap off this lovely little experience, the gal who rang me up (and was sure to explain all about the tea to me!) "forgot" to charge me for the cup of brewed tea I asked for, so I got it for free. She was either pitying me for spending $35 on tea or she thought I was cute. Either way, I was happy to leave five bucks richer and immediately proceeded to spend it at the next designation. Money burns a hole in my pocket, what can I say?

I love sens a five star now. I would say that there was a complete turnaround in 2.5 months.   Service issues are fixed, they pour a mean vodka tonic, the wasabi tofu has maintained its amazing tastiness and I really like the location.  Now if only I could get someone to make sweet sweet love to me in the bathroom.

It has been a year-and-a-half since my last review update, and I still cannot get enough of Sens. I'm here at least 2-3 times a month, sometimes even twice a week!  I really appreciate the love and dedication that Johnny puts into his craft. He cares about the quality and taste of every meal that comes out of his kitchen, the way his staff interacts with customers, and the overall ambiance of the restaurant. I think he has mastered this craft.  Being a vegan I have a plethora of options, which makes me very happy! The mango papaya spring rolls are incredibly refreshing and pair well with the spicy peanut chili sauce, the wasabi tofu is a great crunchy and spicy transition into the incredibly flavorful Hong Kong Flat Rice (I add tofu) or Spicy Saigon with Tofu. Both dishes are loaded with snow peas, cauliflower, onions, and carrots and tons of flavorful sauce in a skillet with crunchy tofu.  Another chart topper for me is the hot and sour soup with tofu. Try the sweet chili sauce that comes on the side for a sweet, spicy, and salty adventure! The red tofu curry is amazing as well. VERY filling.   I'm a huge fan of the plain 'ol vodka tonic, but love that they infuse their own vodkas with a variety of things like chili's and lychee. Dallas G LOVES the "hot and dirty" and I am also a fan of the "Cucumber chill." Although I cannot drink beer anymore, the White Ale is a chart topper.  They also have a great selection of Sake. I took part in their sake tasting last night and became a fan of several new sakes! We downed a bottle of Pure Dawn and were really excited to see the discount after partaking in the tasting! Bonus!  Overall, Sens is definitely my favorite restaurant. The food, the drinks, the love.... and we know all of the waiter/tresses so it makes for an even better experience!  PS... Still love the bathrooms ;-)

Hanny's ... you have quite the tasty Riesling.   But...your service leaves a tad bit to be desired.  On the flip side, you have hot hot hot bartenders, so I really don't mind the wait (sorry DG).  My favorite thing about you is your bathrooms. I mean, I really really love the bathrooms.   Actually, I love the entire place. If I were going to open a bar, I would want it to look exactly like Hanny's. Well, except the meat cutter at the bar, because I am vegetarian. Perhaps I would get an industrial strength cheese cutter. (ha ha ... cheese cutter!)  Ooooo another bonus... you are right off of the light rail and you normally have parking available right outside... therefore I consider you to be in a good location.  Yeah, Hanny's ... I love you. Quite a bit. Let's go steady.

I'm going to start off by saying that I have been to some pretty seedy fast food joints in my day... but I think this JITB takes the cake..  Yeah, I get that you are busy because all of the drunken ASU students romp through here each night... but how hard is it to sweep the floor, wipe the tables or clean the bathroom? Ewwwwwww!!!!  Next... you were not busy, at all,  yet it took five minutes for someone to come take my order... and I was not so nicely informed that for some ungodly known reason you were no longer serving milkshakes at 855pm at night.. but you could serve me a smoothie. Ummmmm... does this make sense? Noooo.... and to add insult to injury, it took seven minutes to make the damn thing. (I know because I timed it)  BTW... don't waste your $2.79 on the pomegranate smoothie. It SUCKS.   And the worst part of all? It is impossible to go to this JITB without being accosted by the homeless hippies.   Unfortunately this filth infested, artery-clogging, non-milkshake-serving-after-some-undisclosed-time establishment will continue to flourish because it is in a good location and drunk people need their tacos.

Wow... This spa is so incredibly impressive! I've been to spas all around the world, and I have to say that Joya ranks among the best.   The resort is beautiful and sets a perfect location for Joya. The lobby is beautiful and it's fun to walk to the flight of stairs and ascend to another world. Picking out a special rock and adding it to the glowing crystal is a nice touch.   The waiting area and locker facilities are top notch. Very clean restrooms stocked with above average necessities.   In the waiting room they serve flavored waters and teas and there is a "silent" room filled with beds so you can just relax in quiet.   The massage itself was great; and I love the motorized bed so the therapist didn't have to add:remove the bolster. The bed was heated and she also used heated towels on my back to help loosen the muscles. There was also a terrific smelling spray she sprayed in the room.   At the end I was asked to select a special card that gave a affirmation. A very nice way to end the massage.   After your massage you can switch into your bathing suit and lay outside at the private spa heated salt pool overlooking Camelback mountain. You are served drinks and have a menu of delicious and healthy food options, including several vega. Options!!!!!   The staff was incredibly friendly and the services were reasonable. I will definitely 100% be back for a spa day!!   They also do mani/pedi downstairs, have a whirlpool, sauna, and steam room.

Aside from the wobbly table and the fact that they serve Kendall Jackson wine, this place is great.  Love the decor, love the atmosphere, love the people, love the zany movies they play.   This place is sexy.  And sneaky.

OH MAH GAWD!  Normally I don't *love* tamales because they are relatively dry, but when I saw The Tamale Store selling Tamales at the Downtown Public Market I just had to try one. They have three regular vegan options in addition to two dessert vegan options, and 5 vegetarian options.  So, I decided to get a hot Southwest Chipotle and ate it at the market, and got an additional 6 frozen; a combo of Southwest Chipotle, Pumpkin, and Sweet Corn.  Well, these tamales are freaking delicious. Incredibly moist and flavorful, but with very few ingredients, and you can pronounce all of them!   Their website touts "We use only the freshest produce and extra lean meats. We never use lard or shortenings. We never use preservatives!!" It is OBVIOUSLY true.  I love The Tamale Store!!!

70+ year old hostess Shelby: "Where does a one-legged waitress work"   Us: *Blank stares*   Shelby: "IHOP"   Yeah... it was one of those nights.   I was actually really impressed with this particular Denny's. Both the hostess and our waitress were EXTREMELY nice and accommodating, especially since we were a large, obnoxiously drunken group of people stumbling in after midnight.   The food came out quick and correct, my cup was never empty and the booth made for a nice resting place for my head.   Thanks Denny's. Without my delicious chocolate milkshake and 2 egg breakfast I would have puked and passed out in the parking lot.

This is the exact place I love to hate. But I can't. I cannot hate you, Lodge. I just can't!  In fact, if this place didn't have taxidermied animals (yes, I just made a word up) and antler headpiece things as chandeliers, I would probably be giving this place 5 stars....... I KNOW! I can't believe it either!!  My first experience with The Lodge was as Yelp Bachelorette. I was hammered (give me a break; it was the most important day of my life so far) so I didn't think it was fair to review after not really "being there," if you know what I mean.  My second experience was last night with THE Bachelor himself, Dallas G. Yet again, the staff was incredibly friendly, quick with the service, and willing to accommodate my vegan, gluten free existence without fault. They have an amazing black bean veggie burger and orgasm inducing sweet potato fries.  DG could learn a thing or two from those fries.  Just Kidding.   Now, here is the BEST part of all: THREE DOLLAR SKY VODKA DRINKS FOR THE LADIES.  You don't need to know the rest.

I'm going to be honest... when my band agreed to play a show here, I was scared to death. We don't really play the type of music a biker bar would play, but hey, whatevs.   I was pretty shocked when I walked in to find Fergie blasting over the speakers, and was even more pleasantly surprised to see how cool the place was. For a dive bar, the place was really big and clean.   We ended up having a really great time playing there. They have a pretty good stage setup and we loved Bill, who handled the sound.   The bartender/waitresses were a little... gruff... but they gave a nice pour and the drinks were really reasonably priced. I didn't try anything to eat, but I didn't hear any complaints from the people that did.   They have some pinball machines and darts in addition to TV's and a smoking porch.   Overall, I thought this place was pretty cool and I would head back there again if I was ever in Mesa!

My Enneagram Type is a 3 and how I present myself to the world is very important. I am not the kind of person who asks for help or that EVER wants to appear like I am not knowledgeable about any given subject. However, I was forced into a situation where I got my first bike and I had absolutely no idea about bike maintenance (or riding rules :-x)  The guys at Trailhead were EXTREMELY helpful and let me ask a plethora of stupid questions I already should have known the answer to (like "Can I ride on the sidewalk" and "is it stupid for me to ride 5+ miles in 115 degree temps"). They made me feel completely comfortable and answered all my questions with ease. I'm sure they probably made fun of me after I left, but they were very helpful and professional while I was there. (I would have laughed at me!!)  I got my bike tuned and washed, my seat adjusted to the perfect height, and an encyclopedia worth of knowledge for $50.   Ohhh oh oh the coolest part was when I dropped it off, the gal who took my cruiser told me that their turnaround time was 24 hours. I got a call two hours later letting me know it was done! Always awesome to have someone under promise and over deliver!  P.S. I forgot to mention... I rode that 5+ miles in 115 degree temps ON the sidewalk ... and look at me, still alive to Yelp about it... but I only did it because they told me it was okay :-)

For a divey bar, this place is actually pretty cool. I paid for a round of drinks for 4 or 5 people and my tab was under $20. You cannot go wrong with that. They also have a pretty good sized menu and the food looks pretty decent. The bar tender was nice and attentive.   They do an open mic ton Tuesday nights, so me and the boys in the band headed down a few weeks ago to play. We had a pretty fun time and are going to do a few more.

Disclaimer: This review is being written by someone with very limited experience taking studio classes  I was nervous about taking a Karve class because 1. I knew nothing about it 2. It has been a while since I took a class and 3. Studios in Scottsdale can be .,... you know.... Scottsdaley...  I utilized the website prior to the class to find out more information about karve, what to wear, what to expect, etc. I found the website to be extremely informative and impressive!  I was pleasantly surprised at how friendly the staff were, especially since it's dab smack in the middle of snottsdale. Everyone was really helpful and informative, and I never felt uncomfortable or intimidated.  The class was definitely a challenge, and I am feeling it this morning, but the instructor (Kendra) was very patient with all of the beginners and made me feel comfortable. Some of my neighbors were a little put off by the class helpers that kept coming over to help get their positions right (I had my own visit a time or two) but I think they just wanted each person to maximize their experience.  The studio is in a great location and is really really nice. It was clean and the temperature and music levels were perfect.  My only complaint was that the instructor did not demonstrate every move, but we did have the class helpers around to fix whatever mistakes we were making.   I really enjoyed the class and bought a 3-class package to try it out a few more times, so I am definitely a fan! If I can walk, maybe I will head back tomorrow....

I have now taken six classes with three different instructors and there have been some additional improvements to the studio, so I thought I would do an update.  I have a love-hate relationship with Karve, but in such a good way. I absolutely love to hate the instructor for kicking my ass :-p  I have taken four classes with Kendra, two with Ali and one with Gina and I was impressed every time. I think Gina kicked my ass the most, Ali inspired me the most and Kendra is definitely the most forgiving.  What I love most about Karve is that the hour flies by, but it is actually fun. Normally I HATE working out, so the fact that I look forward to Karve class is pretty amazing. You can control how much you push yourself, and you get immediate results. I felt better and tighter after just two classes, and I actually find myself missing being there when I am not soaking in the hot tub nursing my sore muscles!  I like the new improvements (lockers, shower, etc) and I really like the girls that work the front desk. They also have daycare for those of you that are parents.   If you are a first timer, DEFINITELY take advantage of one of the new student packages because I guarantee you can't go just once!

Once upon a time I wrote a Yelp about wanting to get the F outta dodge and using Arizona Vital Records to acquire my birth certificate. At the time, it was really just a grandiose idea and I really just wanted a passport because I thought it would make me seem cool.  Let me tell you a little something about Nachos (nutshell: law of attraction) my friends: Anything you want, you can have.  I was lucky enough to study the art of Nachos under its founder, Dallas G. and I think I have mastered this art. Case in point...   Not even two weeks after receiving my birth certificate in the mail, my company gets notification that we won an incredibly prestigious awards and the prize is a trip to The Cayman Islands and I am jet setting in three weeks. (feel free to congratulate me)  After about fifteen minutes of crazy jumping, squealing, and screaming, I realize, "Oh shit, I don't have a passport!!" So I research like a madwoman and call around to seven different places trying to find a place to submit my expedited app and low-and-behold, this lovely post office is the only place in the greater Phoenix area that has an appointment within the next two weeks.  This story is growing long and boring, so I will jump to the point... they got me and my sister in next day, got our pictures taken, our passport applications expedited and did so with a completely unfamiliar air of friendliness you don't find very often with the good 'ol USPS.  The postal line was quick, the dude who helped us made a very funny joke about his co-worker needing to stay in for lunch so she didn't melt in the rain, and I get my passport within the 3 week deadline I have!   Hmmmm... I wonder if they have Yelp in The Caymans....   5 Stars!

When Denny's at 1am is the best meal you have had all day, you know something went horribly awry.   Really I have nothing good to say about PastaBar other than I'm glad we didn't have a wait at 8pm on Friday night, but that is not saying much.   The bread sticks they serve in the beginning? Dook  Wine and beer selection? Also Dook.   All three dishes we ordered came out lukewarm and the portions are really unimpressive, especially for the prices. I was not wowed one bit by anything, including the fried mozzarella. (which, btw, came AFTER our meal despite the fact that we ordered it first, as an appetizer....)   Our server was a nice lady, but the service just wasn't good. The food wasn't good. I don't like the decor. I think its overpriced.   I would really rather have gone to Olive Garden and paid $8.95 for the all you can eat pasta, salad and bread sticks. At least I would have been full when I left.  Thanks Denny's for saving my night.  What a let down this place was.

A few weeks ago, I probably would have hooked Scramble up with a 5-star update, but they did something to piss me off and the service has been a bit sour lately.  I really love and appreciate how accommodating for vegans they are. I love the soyrizo scramble with nutritional yeast and the garlic chili chaluhla sauce. I smother it and it tastes sooooo good that I crave it all week long. I know others enjoy the sauce too because the bottles are always being used, but for some ungodly known reason Scramble decided to stop providing the sauce. WTF man???   The cashiers don't seem to be especially knowledgeable about the products and it generally takes 2x as long to order a vegan meal than it does a normal meal.  They also recently started putting in bigger chunks of green bell pepper which I think really detracts from the taste. I have also been jipped on my avocado twice now, and my English Muffin barely toasted.   I have to admit, the french toast and the English Muffin (when cooked right) have a special place in my soul! And there is nothing better that vegan butter  being readily available.  More knowledgeable cashiers, quicker bus service on a busy day, and a re-introduction of the chili garlic sauce and you will have me back. As for now, I'm so mad about the discontinuation that I cannot even look at you!

Yay! I'm a fan!  Tried out Turf last night for HH.. and even though I arrived exactly at 6pm when it was ending, I saw that the waitress still gave me $0.50 off my Strongbow.  I was actually surprised at how busy it was! We were able to finagle some extra chairs for our table from the nice firemen next to us, but at one point throughout the 3 hour visit I had, the whole place was slammed!  I don't think that they were expecting such a crowd, so the service was a bit slow until they had another waitress show up. She was probably at home watching sitcoms and pissed she had to come in on her day off, but whatever.  I ended up selecting the garden burger, which was delicious and paired with waffle fries. I was really surprised that they had as many veggie options as they did. They also have a veggie boxty, grilled cheese, cheese quesedilla and a couple of salads!  I could not resist trying a slice of the whiskey cake. It was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!!! Check the photos for a shot of it :) I swear, it will make your night!!!  I will be back, especially since the Roosevelt/Central light rail stop is like 1/4 mile away!!!!!!!!

If I am going to spend $7.59 on yogurt, it had better be the best yogurt I have ever tasted. Was this the best yogurt I ever tasted? No. Absolutely not. The soft serve frozen yogurt they used to sell at Smitty's blows this out of the water!  I have been told that this is just a bad location, and that may be true, but I assume that they all use the same products and have similar setups. It is a franchise, after all.  I walked in and there were a ton of people in there but only one employee, so the line was backed up. There were no instructions on how this whole "Do-it-yourself" thing works, so I just assumed you get a cup, put some shit in it, and you pay one flat rate. That  was a $7.59 mistake. I can't afford to be making those types of mistakes. We are in a recession, people!  I ended up putting in a squirt of each of the flavors since there was no way to sample any of them (minus pistachio.. I cannot stomach the idea). The only one I would consider eating again is the cafe latte one. The others were too tart for my liking.  I did like the extensive topping offerings but was disappointed with the little cheesecake bites. They don't even taste like cheesecake. I want my cheesecake bites to taste like cheesecake. Is that too much to ask?!?  It probably doesn't help that I am lactose intolerant and that it was so hot outside that the yogurt melted uber quick, and of course I spilled it all over myself. I know that none of those things are directly Mojo's fault, but hey, I'm on a roll.   Sorry Mojo... I'm just not that into you.

So, I think we got off on the wrong foot. I judged you too soon. I'm sorry.   Knowing in advance to be careful with portion control, I had a much more affordable yogurt ($2.91) and enjoyed it much more when I did not have one of every flavor sitting in my cup.  Tonight I delighted in the non-dairy berry mixed with a little mint, topped with some captain crunch. Weird combo, I know. But it worked.  The berry was a little tart, but the fact that I wont get stomach cramps from the dairy made up for it. The mint was really refreshing and helped mellow out the tart berry flavor. And who doesn't love captain crunch?  I still think the layout is a little off. I finally found the sample cups so I got to sample both flavors in advance before committing.  Thanks for the awesome customer service and the prompting on Twitter to give you another shot.

Oh Luci's, I am so in love with you.   Your delicious soy coconut lattes, your delightful selection of vegan, gluten free items (in store and on menu), your cooking classes (I cannot wait to try one!), your friendly staff, and your beautiful, open, airy environment make you perfect.  Even better is that you are on my way to work and just a bike ride away from my house! This will be helpful because I need a way to even out all the calories I am drinking in these lattes!  I honestly have not a complaint... this really is true love!

I love Dunkin Donuts iced coffee, but this location OBVIOUSLY doesn't know who I am or they would look a little bit happier to see me each morning.  That's right: I am the MAYOR of this Dunkin Donuts. MAYOR.   Of all the DnD in the valley, for some reason the most unfriendly of peeps work here, but I still love you and your iced coconut coffee goodness. I used to love your eggwhite sandwiches and your hashbrowns and your egg mcmuffins, but I am gluten free vegan now, so I cannot have you. But those things are still terrific.   You are cheap, quick, and easy. Who wouldn't love that?

I hate to write a review of a place on the day it gets ROTD, but why not? I'll bask in your glory, Kristin S.   Moira is hot. Like, super sexy. This is the kind of place you take a date to seal the deal. Sexy decor, sexy lights, sexy sushi chefs (if that's what they are called?), sexy bathrooms, sexy metal bead things that lead to the bathrooms, sexy music.   Being a vegetarian I always get the same thing at every sushi place I visit, so I can spot a good veggie roll when I see one. It's easy to tell that the quality of ingredients are above average and super tasty. They have a delish white ale. The HH is awesome and prices in general are fabulous.  Words to the single ladies out there, hit up Moira when you are looking for some sexy. Sushi is way less complicated than a man!

I am a woman that likes lime in her Mexican Beer. I mean, a LOT of lime. Gallo - you scratch me where I itch! They fresh squeeze lime juice and when mixed with your tecate, you are in heaven!  Aside from the best beer in town, they also have amazing fresh squeezed watermelon & lime juice and iced coffee. The best news of all is that the iced coffee is $1.25 and I heard they order from Cartel in Tempe!  I have been to Gallo twice now. The first time I tried the veggie tacos and took a bite of the veggie torta. Both were seriously to die for. Over the weekend I had the huevos rancheros for brunch, and those too were out of this world! They also have a tomatillo sauce that is super good.   Not only is the food and drink amazing, but the prices are awesome too! I had breakfast, iced coffee and two beers for $17.  (I did hear over the weekend that they will be raising their prices soon, which sucks, but I would be fine paying more because the quality certainly justifies it!!)  Even better news, you can get all of this POOL SIDE at the Clarendon pool! Ummm... you really cannot go wrong!  I have no complaints about the service. The menu is small but varied, so as a hotel guest I feel like you could eat there a few times during your trip without feeling worn out of the taste.  I am super stoked that Gallo is now in Clarendon, because I will spend my weekends delighting in that delicious Tecate while I munch on some $2 veggie tacos poolside!

Last night I got groped by Ron Jeremy, gave several lap dances, consumed Jello Shots in copious quantities, bought a crazy vibrator, jumped on a moving bus.... the rest I'll keep private.  My point is, none of this amazing night would have been possible if it weren't for the kick ass Real London Bus!  Johnathan took great care of us, the bus was rad and EVERYONE loved it... we were piping music, dancing on poles, drinking... just a total blast and it was affordable.  Thanks for making Dallas G's birthday a monumental success! Highly recommended!

Moving forward, you will probably be able to find me here every Sunday with my laptop day drinking to my hearts content. They have a fabulous patio with comfortable furniture and a relaxed vibe and one kick-ass mojito. I also REALLY enjoyed the chopped salad (veganized, of course).  My only complaint is that it is way too expensive. Hoping that they run some awesome weekend specials so I don't break the bank hanging out!  Oooooo just a quick update: BICYCLE DISCOUNT: Be Green! - Ride your bicycle to Local Breeze for Brunch and receive a 10% discount on your entire check.

SouperSalad has become one of the best lunch choice options for me for a multitude of reasons outside of it being conveniently close to work.  Up at the counter you can grab a special vegan or gluten free menu to carry around with you as you build your salad or pour your soup. It seems pretty obvious with salad, but sometimes you don't know... especially when it comes to salad dressing or toppings.  I have eaten here a ton of times, but the new office trend is getting the salad to go. A HUGE container for just salad comes with two small containers for dressing and a bag for bread. $3.99. You WILL be full. If you want the whole chabang (salad, soup, and potatoes) it's $5.99.  Join the email club and they send you coupons all the time. It's great when a bunch of us from the office go.  We also ordered one of their fruit platters for a work party and it was awesome. For $13.99 we got a huge plate full of various fresh fruits, and they even included serving spoons!   They are generally friendly, but slow as death... so that is the reason I am docking a star.

I have been coming to this LA Fitness for five years. Whether that bodes well for me or not I will leave up to your discretion. I have seen better days before my metabolism decided to hibernate.  What I will say is that there is something about this location that makes it way more comfortable than any of the other locations I have been to (7th Ave/Greenway, Elliot/Priest, Warner/Dobson, Scottsdale/McDowell). Perhaps it is the lower ceiling. Perhaps it is all the gay men. It could even be the nostalgia from the time I tore my hamstring. Who knows.  Here are the only drawbacks I can see:  1. Don't try to do cardio right after work on a Monday or Tuesday.  2. You can easily become intoxicated on Saturday or Sunday morning... it seems all the party people feel the need to atone for their sins the night before by sweating it out in the morning 3. Those personal trainers are suh-leeee-zeee 4. If you dislike cutoff sleeves on men, this is their mecca.   Ample parking. Cheap monthly fee of $24.99. It doesn't smell. Lots of equipment.   Get off your fat ass and just go.

My sister and I met for lunch at Pita Jungle and saw that All About Nails has a $5/off promo when you get a mani/pedi.  We both needed one so we decided to stop in.   When we walked in, one gal was getting a pedicure and the remainder of the place was empty. Theresa filled the water next to the girl getting a pedi and had me sit down and my sister had to wait for the guy to finish. When he finished her, he barely even cleaned the bowl before having my sister sit.   I wants just a regular pedicure but she kept bugging me to do callus or a sugar scrub so I finally agreed. Halfway into my scrub her next appointment showed up and she rushed through my massage and did a really poor job painting my nails. There was polish all over my skin and I had to ask the guy next to my sister to brush off the extra polish because Theresa rushed off to help the other lady and she told me someone else would help me.   The guy doing my sisters nails had someone start gel removal while he finished her toes and took her to start her manicure while I sat and waited with my hands in a bowl of acetone (not in foil with acetone soaked cotton like they did with my sister and places normally do) while several women just walked in and got served immediately. I sat for almost 40 minutes before Theresa came back and at that point I told her to just take the gels off because I didn't have time. She tried to argue with me but I told her I didn't want to do a manicure anymore. She charged me $5 for the gel removal when I had already pealed 90% off while waiting with my hands in the acetone.  My sisters guy also ended up cutting her really bad and filed her nails way down. Another guy had to take over and fix his mistakes.  I really hate to complain about a business but we had a really bad experience, bad customer service, and I left having to go to my regular nail place after spending 1.5 hours there and I'm going to have to pay for a polish change on my toes because they are so bad.   I would steer clear of this place.

If you are ever having a bad day and want to get treated like the president, head on over to Central Grille. Seriously. Both times I have been here (Once for Sunnyslope Art Walk and once for Happy Hour with a girlfriend) the entire staff is friendly and extremely attentive. They will sit down and chat with you, bring you extra bread and are always right there with refills.   The eggplant appetizer is an absolute winner. I think there are about ten pieces of delicious fried eggplant with mozzarella and marinara sauce... all for $7..  I also enjoyed the cheese plate. It is $5 on happy hour special and comes with three big slices of cheese (I believe there was a blue, Gouda and one other type) along with bread.   They serve Iily Coffee and Espresso and it is a strong cup! Pair it with one of the really, REALLY tasty desserts! I cannot remember the name of what I had, but I think it was called something layered. It was similar to tiramisu and you got your own side of warmed chocolate to drizzle over it. My mouth is watering thinking about it!!  The inside is kind of a tamed down version of Durant's, but the outside patio is amazing. They have cute lights up and wicker chairs with comfy seat pads. When the weather is nice you can sit out there for hours! As a bonus, you can hear the live music from the patio even though they play inside.   They also have a large variety of Happy Hour appetizers for $5... My friend really enjoyed her tacos! The $5 House Wine and $3.50 well drinks are also an awesome way to compliment your tasty appetizers.   I'm super stoked that Central Grille is right off of the canal because I can ride my bike there (its a 2 mile ride from my house - score!).  I love this new addition to the 'Slope!

If you want to get your ass kicked, go to TDM and ask for Linda. She won't let you slack off, she won't let you lose form, and she won't let you be lame and try to take breaks in the middle of exercises.  Why, you ask, would one want to be tortured so? Well, because as a woman in her mid-to-upper twenties, I need all the help I can get fitting into my skinny jeans.  My favorite thing about this class is that Linda knows what you are capable of, and she won't let you off easy. She has a keen understanding for who you can and cannot push, and it is really impressive.  She is the next best thing to Jillian Michaels (Biggest Loser)... that is both scary and rad at the same time! See ya soon, TDM!

I have used B&L Pools over the past year and have been really unhappy with my service almost the entire time. I just couldn't find anyone else to handle my needs so I felt stuck with them.  The regular guy who serviced the pool was very unfriendly, and would actually yell at me over the phone about leaving the pump on too long or having to move the trash can out of the way of the fence. Really unprofessional, rude, and inappropriate. I'm a paying customer. Treat me with respect.   On at least 3 occasions he let the dogs into the pool area and just left them there vs. making sure they were locked back behind the gate on the side yard (I have a doggie door that lets out into a runway enclosed by the gate you open to get into the pool area.) My dogs cannot swim (fat little pugs) so if they would have gotten in the pool, they would have drowned. They are like my children and there was no respect for their safety.   I paid $100 for weekly service. This means $25 a pop and it is supposed to cover cleaning and chemicals. The last time he came he was there for 3 minutes, didn't even test the water, and brushed for about 15 seconds. No backwash. No chemicals. This is pretty consistent.  When the catch was emptied, he left pine needles all over the yard that inevitably will just fall back in the pool. The pool was never scrubbed, brushed, skimmed, or manually vacuumed, so I had to spend another $19/month to rent an automatic vacuum (that works poorly) just so the pool would get cleaned.  Overall, B&L did not provide a positive experience for me and gave lackluster service. I would not recommend getting pool service from this company.

I've been to Biagio Nails twice now, and I am definitely a fan. They have a fabulous selection of gels (including magneto!) and always have the most current trends.  The salon itself is very clean and nice, with really great pedicure chairs. Their pedicures come with a sea salt scrub, no extra charge.  Both experiences left me with a great mani/pedi and a loose neck from the massage they give.   The only reason I'm not rating this salon 5 stars is the people at the front are not very friendly and I have felt as though I was an inconvenience to them.   Reasonable price... comparable with other salons.   They have a ton of regulars there which tells you something good.

I've now been to Miracle View twice and I am so impressed and thrilled with them. The ultrasound tech is very professional and knowledgeable but also very funny and fits right in with your group during the ultrasound.   They do a great job of getting images and pointing things out, like all the body parts and where the hair starts to come in. She also uses a lot of tricks to get the baby to move around so you can see them really well during the appointment.   Afterwards they give you a goodie bag to take home along with a bunch of printed images in color and b&w, and if you come back for a second appointment you get a great discount!   I'm really glad we got the opportunity to see our little guy in such vivid detail and share an ultrasound with our family members!

I have absolutely fallen head-over-heels in love with Hula's for so many reasons! Let's just go over a few:  -The amazing tofu tacos -The "I'm-gonna-fuck-you-up" Scorpion Bowl (they light the 151 on fire!) -The kick ass happy hour -Outdoor seating with misters -Sweet potato fries  This is a really laid back environment with a lot of options for veggies AND vegans, and they have really awesome drinks. Do yourself the favor and head here with a group of friends and split the scorpion bowl. You can thank me later, just be prepared to call yourself a DD.

All Hail the Dutchess of Total Wine, AMber W!  Total Wine is probably my favourite (For Nathan S.) place on the planet. For reals, yo.  You can waste a whole entire afternoon walking around looking at new wines, spirits, and beers. It never gets old!  They have such a huge variety, and in every price range... single beers, 6-12-24-30 packs... single serving bottles up to kegs... they even have multiple gluten free beers and ciders for me!   Excellent customer service, great prices (generally $1-2 cheaper than walmart or the grocery store, on average), perfectly located next to Chipotle, and they always have the product I need readily available.   I tried asking once if they would let me bring a cot and just move in, but I got denied. Perhaps one day my fantasy will come true!

Thai house has quickly become my favorite Thai place. The flavors in their yellow curry are outstanding. I also appreciate that they will make the papaya salad for me with no fish sauce and no shrimp and it still comes out tasting great. Perfect place for vegan, vegetarian, or normal eater just like most Thai places.   The rest of my non-vegan family always loved their dishes as well. They are never stingy with the rice and the service has always been good for us.

"What are you wearing?!?"  "Are those gloves for your FEET??"  "Are you going to go climb a tree??"  Those are the types of questions you will get if you go to Fitness Road, purchase the most awesome product ever (Five Finger Barefoot Shoes), and wear them out in public.. so if you embarrass easy or do not like attention, stick with your boring ol closed toed's and leave the prehistoric trekking to me.   The gal who helped me was awesome... she told me a ton about the shoes, about the running club they have, about this special stick that helps get the lactic acid out of your calves after running... I loved her.  The store pretty much just sells the shoes. but they also do other fitness/health related things like massage, nutrition training, and I believe personal training.  I fully plan on getting a ninja suit made so that when I am sporting my five finger shoes, I can hop around, climb things, slice people with Samari swords, and disappear off into the night with one of those magic smoke balls. These shoes are THAT cool.

Have you ever had the feeling that you just wanted to get the F outta dodge... just leave it all behind and head to Spain or Thailand or Bermuda... and you pack your bags, you are looking and tickets, and then you realize "Shit, I don't have a passport!"   Even worse is when you realize, "HOLY shit, I don't have a birth certificate!"  So, you frantically search online and figure out that you need to get your birth certificate from Vital Records, but you sure as hell are not going to drive down there during the day when you work in Ahwatukee... we have all seen what downtown is like during the day... so you decide to order online...  Okay... I'm going to stop this "hypothetical" tale and get to the point... using the online system AZ Vital Records utilizes (Vital Check) was extremely easy, efficient, and when I just received my birth certificate only 3 business days later, I am jumping with joy and could quite possibly burst out of my clothing at any given second. I don't even mind that it cost me $36 (I think that is really reasonable being that it is evidence of my citizenship in this country)  Now, let's hope that the expedited passport service is as effective... then is will be hasta la vista, baby!   Hypothetically, of course.

Generally speaking I am not the hugest fan of Pita Jungle, but I really enjoy this particular location. It is large, has a great atmosphere, friendly staff, and an awesome patio.  My favorite thing about PJ is their INCREDIBLE happy hour. They do a huge selection of tapas for $1-2 each! You can get a few small plates and try multiple things and have your bill, with drink, come out under $10. Slammin!   Tapas items: Hummus Trio, Garlic Dip, Sauteed Mushrooms, Tomato and Mozzarella, Olives, Taziki, Some Lemon Chicken Dish, Olive Oil and Pita, and Falaffel. I'm sure I missed a few others. They also do $1 of cocktails and beers, and have $5 draft margaritas. HH ends at 6pm.   Generally I think the food is pretty bland, but I have also come to love the cilantro jalapeno hummus, the 1000 bean entree, and the Caribbean salad. I also enjoy their falaffel.   I'm not really sure what would make PJ a 5-star for me other than all around improvement on the flavor of the food. Maybe I am just picky.

Dallas G. had an unfortunate hockey incident on Tuesday evening and thought that he dislocated his patella (kneecap). He called on Wednesday and got a next day appointment. with Dr. Whisler. Score!  After arriving I quickly noticed that the office was huge, busy, and has a lot of doctors. I thought we would be in the waiting room forever but they actually took us back within ten minutes of our appointment time!  Score 2.  Dr. Whisler took the time to thoroughly explain exactly what happened, how it happened, why it happened, and what Mr. G can do in the future to prevent it from happening again. Fortunately it was just painful and no real damage was done :-) Score 3!  Honestly, I have never had a Doctor be so friendly and spend so much time with me (or whomever I am the Dr. with) and it was incredibly impressive. Score 4!  They got us in and out with x-rays and a knee brace pretty quickly and everyone we encountered was friendly, cracked jokes with their co-workers (professionally, of course), and were really open to helping with whatever we needed. Score 5!  I really wish all medical professionals were this pleasant and thorough! Thanks Dr. Whisler!  FIIIVVVVEEEE STARS!

I know that Yelp has their own TOS, but I have my own very important rule: Never review a place after going there only once unless you never plan on returning. Now, while I would come back here in a heartbeat, I'm hoping I won't ever NEED to!  Yesterday I had some real funky stuff going on with my left eye, and having known someone with a torn retina, I was freaking. I called 5 other offices before Associated, and could not get in anywhere. The gal at the front desk was so sweet and she got me in an hour-and-a-half later!  The office itself is beautiful. Clean with comfortable waiting rooms, modern decor, state-of-the-art equipment, and incredibly friendly staff. The technician who dilated my eyes made appropriate and relevant jokes to help relax me and made me very comfortable. The doctor I saw was equally amicable, and incredibly knowledgeable.   Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better experience, especially under such stressful conditions. Fortunately I only had a "retinal migraine" and no eye issues, but in the future if I ever have an eye issue... I'll be right back to Associated.  They have an optical store attached as well with frames and contacts.   HIGHLY recommended.

Unfortunately I have to do a review update that is not good for Pom Cafe. I really, really wanted to enjoy this place the second time around and give them another shot, but I'm totally disappointed.  First off, they got my order wrong and only sent one sandwich instead of the two I ordered. They just combined the two together. It didn't even make sense.  Second, when my receptionist got there, they left out two items and had to call her back to come pick them up. By the time she went back and got the food they forgot to give her, everything arrived back at the office cold and the bread was soggy. The side of "crispy tofu" we ordered was not crispy at all.   Overall everyone at the office thought their food was okay, but not great...  probably because everything arrived cold and limp... and for an $8.50 egg mc-muffin sandwich, I'm certainly hoping for better than okay.    I don't plan on going back. :-(

4.5 Stars.  Over the past few months I have given Pomegranate Cafe another try, or two, or three... and I have been very pleased with the improvement in their menu, the service, the speed, and the food itself.   Everything in the restaurant is vegan and can be made vegetarian which means I can eat anything there... heck yes! They even have a wide variety of raw items including desserts.  They have all-day breakfast and are always posting delicious looking brunch items on the weekend (Facebook). I haven't made it for a weekend brunch, but it is on my list.  My favorite items have to be the Lumberjack sandwich, the southwest mac n cheese, the hibiscus cooler, and the cowgirl cookies.   They are in the middle of a remodel right now, doubling their space, and the past two times I have been in there the place has been absolutely packed... so I'm not the only one taking notice of this great spot :-)  Keep up the good work, PC!

I don't know if it is always this way (one WOULD have to assume it is) but I swear to god they were doing a casting call for the VH1 show "Tool Academy" the night I went here.   After waiting in line for twenty minutes and going through a Fort Knox age verification process I walk into the bar and see a gigantic circle five guys deep around a mechanical bull. I threw up in my mouth. A lot.   If you are a guy looking to watch sleazy, low confidence drunk chicks hump a bull or if you are a sleazy, low confidence drunk chick, this is the place for you!

As I have mentioned in several reviews before, I have my own ATOS (Amber Terms of Service) in which my #1 rule is to never review a place that you have only been to once unless you know for certain you will not be back.  As I sit here eating this giant pickle, I find myself IN a pickle... because while this is the first time I have eaten at Jimmy John's, they DID deliver free samples to the office yesterday... so is that technically 1+???  Well, even if its not, I don't care. I am impressed beyond words at their incredible ability to serve their business clientele... Let me explain.   Yesterday, out of nowhere, a nice delivery boy from JJ just drops by 10 or 12 mini subs for the office to sample. Super nice. Great marketing tool. Everyone was happy as a clam. Who doesn't love free food?  So, today, I felt like it would be a good idea to return the favor and give them our business. We had 12 people order subs, and the entire ordering process was incredibly easy. You can order online, or call in the order. When everything was delivered, each sub had the correct name, they itemized the receipt by our names so that each person could have the correct amount deducted from their paycheck, and everything was 100% correct. No mixups.   Aside from the incredible convenience of their ordering, their friendliness, and the awesome delivery, the subs were incredible tasting and at a fabulous price point. The bread (even though I'm not supposed to eat it - whoopppps) was fresh and delicious, the veggies were all fresh and piled on, and my pickle was huge and incredibly satisfying. (get your mind out of the gutter)  You can choose 7 grain bread or a french roll, or for those who want the low-carb route, you can wrap your sub in lettuce! They have a great variety of subs, including two veggie options that can be made vegan, chips, pickles, drinks. Their website is really cool too - you can figure out the exact nutritional value of your entire meal, and the site is fun and easy to use.   Anyway - incredible all around. I am very impressed and can't wait for our next group order!!

As far as I know, I'm the only person in this town that has a dish named after them. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I'm right. I mean, I'm always right.  By now, if you read my reviews, you know that I am vegan and I don't eat gluten. This makes dining out quite an issue at times, especially for breakfast/brunch.   I really wanted to hit up The Vig Uptown for brunch because I like it as a Happy Hour spot, the space is incredible, it is within a bike ride from my house, and I love the Original Vig, but alas, there was nothing on the menu to accommodate me. I gently mentioned in person and a few times on FaceBook that having some sort of tofu scrambler would really improve their menu.  They listened. They created. They named. (after me!!!)  We stopped by for brunch this past Sunday for the dishes debut, and got a personal hello from Tucker. He was excited because they had already sold TEN AMber Scramblers that morning and it isn't even officially on the menu yet! I'm already a star!  So, whats the verdict on the AMber Scrambler? Amazing. Seriously. The thing that really sets this apart from other scrambler dishes is sun dried tomatoes. They bring such a delicious flavor! It certainly doesn't hurt that it comes with their signature guac and a side of pico.  I'll be here every weekend for the delicious dish and the $5 fresh squeezed mimosas! If you know whats good for you, you will too.

I joined my gal pal Chrissy P for a drink at The Lounge last night and I was pleasantly surprised. Like she said, it is definitely the Sidebar of Sunnyslope!  We had great, friendly, attentive service from Chris (and he wasn't rough on the eyes, ladies!!) and he was pretty knowledgeable about the drinks.  I opted for a red wine flight and was pleased with the selection. There were two cabs, two zins, a red, a pinot noir, a merlot, two malbecs, and another choice or two. Mostly from California. The flight was $9.  They had a ton of variety of chairs and areas to sit, which was really awesome. You could sit on the high-tops, share a table for four in big white contemporary chairs, grab a normal table by the window, or opt for these really huge oversize comfy purple chairs, which we did.   Mellow lounge music played over the speakers and there were several TV"s with relevant sports on. The Magic 8 Balls were a cool touch. The place has a really good vibe. I dig it.   The food selection was made of appetizers, but unfortunately as a gluten free vegan, all I could eat were the freshly made potato chips. By unfortunately I mean "THANK GOD" because they were delicious!  Overall I am really jazzed about this place! A quick five minutes away from my house, this is the perfect way to wind down from a stressful day!  I hope they adopt a happy hour and add some more vegan items to the menu and I will become a regular!

My only complaint about Short Leash is that they don't follow me around town in the food cart, which means I cannot eat delicious hot dog concoctions all day! How unfair is that?!?  Well, Amber... we all know you are a VEGAN, so why do you want to be followed around by a hot dog cart?   Well, Reader... Short Leash has VEGGIE DOGS! That is right... this delicious, convenient, amazing food cart has VEGGIE DOGS!  The bread, however, is not vegan. But that is fine, because they chop up your wiener into little bite sized pieces and load it up with one of the many (50+??) ingredients they have available. And when you don't get it with bread, you get two!  I top my double wiener with pinto beans, sauteed onions, green chilies, jalapenos, and tomatoes. I'm going to come up with a name and have them name one special after me.  Excellent customer service, positive vibe, delicious, high-quality ingredients, and I legally get to say wiener six times in 1 review!  Wiener wiener wiener!

I have been to other Barre fitness classes (Karve, Dailey Method) and I absolutely love all of them... but there is something extra special about Pure Barre.  I like the studio. I like the instructors. I like the equipment. I like the  music. I like the great class times (morning, afternoon, and two evening classes plus weekends). I like the flexible packages. I'm doing the 1 month intro special - unlimited for $100.  I LOVE that the instructors make it a point to learn your name, and to compliment you during the class. It helps encourage you to push harder. The one-on-one attention they give to make sure you are getting the most out of your workout is amazing.  I have been to 4 or 5 classes now and my sides (muffin top) are already starting to get tighter! AH-MAY-ZINNNGGG!!!  Highly recommended. Take a class with Marirose; she will make your thighs burn like FIRE!

Damn Jessica F for getting the FTR on this!   I made my first trip out to this new GFC location this weekend and was really excited to see an expanded retail area and the addition of sandwiches. If you have ever been to the other location on Thomas, you will be very happy with the increased selections and moving room!  As usual, all of the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, and very very knowledgeable about their products.   I got some vegan gf donuts that taste a lot like gingerbread in addition to the herb baguette rolls, vegan banana cupcakes, vegan chocolate chip cookies, and hot dog buns. Everything has been great so far and I love that everything goes in the freezer.  I am also really excited that they bake vegan gf cakes in multiple sizes! This is great since I am normally left out of the cake club during birthdays!  All around a great place that caters to those of us with special diets! Thanks GFC!  :0)

SaBai Thai has become my new go-to place. I absolutely love the dishes, the service, the ambiance, and the overall experience!  This Wendy's converted building is quite deceiving. The inside is beautifully modernized and offers a nice, clean, upscale, and accommodating atmosphere. At night, when the lights go down and the candles are lit, SaBai Thai is a perfect spot to take a date.   They have an EXCELLENT happy hour, but their normal drink prices are incredibly reasonable as well. I can't tear myself away from the $4 bottle of Sake ($1 off beers/spirits and $5 glasses of wine on HH). I generally sit up at the bar to shoot the shit, but happy hour is good throughout the restaurant.   As far as food is concerned, I am absolutely addicted to the lettuce wraps (tofu easily substituted) and the classic yellow curry, but the SaBai Fried Rice and the eggplant dish are delicious as well.   The staff is incredibly friendly, especially Chris and the owner Eric who you can see bopping around from table-to-table making sure the guests are taken care of. His wife, Holly, mans the back of the kitchen and together they have created the perfect Modern Thai environment.  In additional to the great atmosphere, delicious high-quality food, great drink prices, outstanding happy hour, warm and attentive service, they also have GREAT hours, especially for an Asian restaurant. Most Thai places close from 3-5 and don't do Sunday lunch service. SaBai Thai's modern take grants us Thai lovers action all day long, 7 days a week!  I think even Mr. Sheen would agree, SaBai Thai is a WINNER!!!

The great thing about watching movies in your home is your comfy couch, the ability to drink whatever you want, and the luxury of whomever you are with asking "can I grab you anything while I am up?"  The sucky thing about watching movies in your home is that they aren't brand new, your TV isn't the size of a movie screen, your surround sound can't possibly be as good, and you don't have movie theater popcorn.  But wait... what if you could have ALL of those things! YES! That would be amazing! Drinking a beer on a couch with surround sound watching the latest release with a giant artery clogging bag of popcorn.  I know what you are thinking. I do. "Amber, that is just TOO good to be true..." and "That only exists in HEAVEN."  Nope, faithful fan, untrue. This (and more) exists at UltraStar Cinemas.  The 9 theaters that cater to 21+ (NO KIDS!) allow you to drink beer/wine, provide servers that bring you drinks and food during the show, amazing recliners, foods like hummus and paninis, and awesome customer service.   This past weekend Dallas G and I decided to catch a flick (Lincoln Lawyer - great flick) and the next showtime was UltraStar. We raced over, ordered our beers and hummus, and popped into 21+ theater 9. Unfortunately, they oversold and we started to freak. But have no fear, the theater attendant saved the day by talking to his manager and getting us in the VIP section.   What does this mean? Well, we got our own room with couches, our own surround sound with volume control, our own AC, and our own server. People walked by thinking we were famous (maybe Katy Perry and Russell Brand, even)...   No brainer.

After my third trip to Tien Wong, I thought it was time to write the raving review it so obviously deserves, even despite the fact that they do not serve alcohol!  Hot Pot is basically fondue with a soup broth instead of cheese. It is an absolutely amazing concept and is a great group or date event. It is a blast to go through and pick different veggies and tofu (they have meat and fish as well) and try new things you never would have tried under normal circumstances.  I have really grown to love the greens, Tang O, taro root, the five spice tofu, and the iced tofu. They have probably 5-6 kinds of mushrooms, bock choy, spinach, four or five types of noodles, dumplings, and somehow like 4-5 different types of tofu! It is amazing! You also get a peanut and a soy dipping sauce, but I think the flavor of the vegetables drenched in miso is amazing without any sauce!  I saw someone complain about the price here on Yelp, but we had dinner last night for 4 with a hot tea and a dessert for $50.00 total. We had 4 different dishes of tofu and 7 different kinds of vegetables in our huge pot of miso broth so that we could try our a variety. Every single one of us was stuffed and remained full throughout the rest of the night. I think it is a great value.   People who don't normally eat vegetables or Asian enjoy the fun experience, and enjoy being able to try something they normally wouldn't. Also a great place to take a group of people so that you can all try something a little different.

I have to be honest; Tsom really reminded me of college cafeteria food. Based on that assessment, it seems they are in a good location being close to ASU, but as a non-college student, I was incredibly underwhelmed.   While I think the idea of a salad bar is cool, especially when it is all veggie and filled with a variety of things like hummus and bean salads, the actual meals like pasta and falaffel are pretty uneventful.  Sorry Tsom, I don't plan on coming back.

The first few times I went to Windsor, I didn't love it. There was nothing wrong, it was just... I think this place is a guy hangout. It feels masculine. Not in a sports bar kind of way, but more like a place two friends that are guys regularly go to have a beer that don't want to drink bud light at a dive.   Over time, the $5 pitchers of beer before 5pm have won me over.   In addition to the great happy hour, they make some pretty spectacular drinks. The Number 17 is so refreshing. Manny is a fabulous bartender. They also have a few vegan food options - a sandwich and a mixed grain salad in addition to some sides. All have been fresh and tasty.   I love that during nice weather they can open the place up, and the patio is great. The bathrooms are pretty cool as well.   The parking is the real drawback. You either have to valet, which fortunately is complimentary, or try to find a spot on the residential streets that won't end up getting you towed..  Overall I give Windsor a 3.5-4.0 stars.

Just like the Scottsdale location, Phoenix Pure Barre offers up a great schedule with classes 7 days a week, a well lit, airy environment, and kick ass instructors who do just that... kick your ass!  I absolutely love Pure Barre and really enjoy the intense workout that hits all the right spots (thighs, bum, muffin top, and jiggly arms). I feel more burn in that hour than I can get all week going to the gym.  This location also has a really awesome retail area with shirts, hats, PB balls, hats, socks, and other merch.  My favorite, though, it the cute "Pure Potty" (the bathroom). These sisters are super cute  :-)

Overall, I think this is a good Harrah's property and a great way to "staycation" without having to drive too far.  The hotel rooms in both the tower and the pool area are nice and spacious, and if you have a Total Rewards card you can get comps or really cheap rooms even on the weekend. Very clean and each room has a mini fridge, toiletries, and a coffee setup.   The two times I have stayed here the staff has always been friendly and accommodating, especially the bellman. They have free wi-fi and complimentary valet parking.  The casino itself has table games, a poker room, bingo, and lots of slot machines. The tables start at $5 and they have plenty of penny slots.   They have a really large pool with a swim-up bar, but it can be very busy on the weekends and filled with lots of kids. The drinks are reasonably priced for a hotel pool. I wouldn't really recommend the cabana because you get free bottled water, but you can't bring in any outside food or beverages and you don't have a dedicated server so you have to go and wait at the pool bar that most times seems understaffed.   There are are several restaurants ranging from a quick take-out cafe with sandwiches and fried foods to a gourmet sit-down steakhouse. They also have a buffet and a poolside restaurant that serves breakfast and lunch.   Most weekend nights they have free entertainment/live music in the lounge.   The hotel is next to a large cineplex with movies, bowling, a sports bar, and another restaurant so if you get bored swimming or gambling there is something else for you to do. You won't really find anything else to do in Maricopa :)   Overall I think this is a great place to have a weekend stay.

The fact that I have yet to write my review of Nami should be an insult to vegans and sweet lovers everywhere!  Nami, short for Tsoynami, is heaven on earth. or the moon. jupiter. wherever there is heaven, there is Nami.  Soy "tsoft" serve ice cream. Winkies. Snickerdoodles. Various cupcakes. Various cakes. Coffee with a choice of soy, almond, rice, and even hazelnut milk!  Although they have only done it once, Nami is planning on running a regular Sunday brunch in February. I thought it was amazing when I went to the beta test. Multiple scramble options in addition to chilaquilles and other brunch creations.   Do yourself a favor and stop by. If not for the treats, for the awesome dancing and singing always taking place!  PS... Cheddar and Chive Scone (thank me anytime)

It is an honor to be the First To Review this brand new Green location!  Just like Green Tempe, the menu provides an array of delicious vegan treats ranging from salads to flatbread pizzas to bugers, Po Boys, and bowls filled with various varieties of mock meat.  Everything at this location tastes exactly the same as the other location, however, the love exudes from every meal prepared by the incredibly friendly and eager staff.  The location is great, and is perfectly located next to Nami - where you can pick up your vegan soft tserve "blizzards" in any form you desire. I recommend peanut butter with double chick-o-sticks.  The actual restaurant is super clean, modern, and fresh. The front is a glass garage door that when the weather allows, will open to a patio. I cannot wait for this.   If you have not been to Green, I highly recommend you give it a try... the artichoke gratine, chili fries, yellow curry with crispy tofu, and secret BBQ sandwich are among my favorites.  And don't forget your dessert next door at Nami!

YES! FTR on location number two!  I have been a huge fan of Hawaiian Experience Spa in Scottsdale for probably three years now, and I am very exited that they opened this Chandler location because it spares me from the long drive to Northeast Scottsdale!  Just like Scottsdale, the Chandler location is decorated in Hawaiian theme and they certainly went all out. I really love the lounge that overlooks palm trees and the water! You can't get much closer to Hawaii!  The facility is really nice, and I love that they added a second locker/changing room. They also have TWO showers (which are worth the trip on their own), steam rooms, and infrared saunas which are supposed to be great to kick start your metabolism.  One of the best things about Hawaiian Experience Spa is their wide variety of couples treatments and how well they accommodate couples. They have great date nights or romantic packages for just because (or special occasions). Couples can use all of the facilities together (separate if you prefer) which is really cool.   I know that Steve and Kathy put a TON of love into creating this location and I am so happy to see this great local business expanding!

Johnny did it again.   Sens was my favorite restaurant, yet somehow with Sochu, Johnny found a way to improve on what was already fantastic.  While I admit the location is not the best (especially with recent construction) the bigger space, the separate bar and dining room, the extra bathrooms, the expanded menu, and the newly added happy hour more than make up for it.  The expanded menu is exceptional; including an expansive tapas and family style section, and accommodates veggies, vegans, and carnivores alike.   The outside patio is another really fantastic element. Thank you for the heaters.  Well done, Johnny!

I used Sal to create cake pops for my sisters engagement party and was so pleased. She worked with me to make custom designs and went out of her way to accommodating; and on short notice!  She even made me special vegan and gluten free matching options which was very nice because I rarely get to partake in sweets!  The cake pops were a complete hit and unlike cupcakes or cake, there were no leftovers at the end of the party!   It was convenient to pick them up from the Uptown Farmers Market in a Saturday where she also sells individual cake pops including those vegan gluten free ones. I've been dreaming about them ever sense and can't wait to have another.   Highly recommend using Sal for cake pops.

This new location is perfectly situated about one mile from my house, which is fantastic! I think this is a great location and serves a huge need in this area.  This location, probably partially because it is new, is very very clean. They have a ton of equipment, and all of the cardio machines have TV's with plugins for your headphones so you can watch your own show while you work out. They have two types of elipticals, treadmills, stair climbers and steppers, and a variety of cycles.  Although this club is new and doesn't have a huge customer base, they have a good amount of group classes like Zumba, Pilates, Yoga, Kickboxing, and Total Body Works. They also have a spin class that I'm terrified to try.  The staff is nice and helpful. I needed to get my barcode replaced and the gal got it done in 30 seconds and didn't charge me the $25 fee they are supposed to.  They have a lot of weight machines, but they could use a few more for arms. That is why I don't have 5 stars. They have a great variety of machines for legs, chest, back, etc but hardly any for arms and I hate using free weights.  They have a pool, racquetball, and Kids club like other locations and I look forward to the addition of the juice bar!

I've been coming to Gojo for several years and I really can't think of a better value out there! They can accommodate probably any dietary restriction, even me as a gluten free vegan!   I always get the veggie platter which is $7.99 and it comes with 4 different items on injera bread. You eat everything here with your hands/injera bread, in case you don't know what you're getting into!   Some of the items are spicy, which I personally love, so make sure to ask if you're sensitive to spice. Everything is so flavorful and even though a lot of dishes sound similar they all have their own distinct flavor.   Try the cinnamon tea; it's delicious!   The service can sometimes be slow when they are busy because there is normally only one server, but it's the type of environment that you don't rush anyway. Go to take your time, enjoy your company, and enjoy your meal and the experience. It's definitely a different and unique dining experience and everyone should try it at least once!

I came to Adele after I had a bit of a falling out with my last hair stylist, and I have been so pleased with my cuts and color over the past almost year.  The salon itself is absolutely darling and filled with fantastic little details. The natural light from the big windows really makes for a fantastic ambiance.  It is fantastic to see Adele go out on her own and create her own salon. That has to be incredibly scary and it seems to have paid off for her! I absolutely love how reasonable her prices are as well!   I am always incredibly pleased with the cut, color, and style that she gives me. She is warm and gracious and makes you feel comfortable; offering tea or water and giving great head massages while she washes you out!  I'm so thankful to have such a solid person handling my hair and refer others to her any chance I get!!

I absolutely love HRH. I stay here every time I go to Vegas, and that is normally about 6 or 7 times a year. The rock theme makes the casino a lot of fun, and the high ceilings help so that you barely notice anyone smokes.   Here are some of the really great things I like about HRH: -Rewards Program (I get free rooms all the time) -Their dealers (especially craps dealers) -Reliquary Spa (giant Roman bath!!) -The Paradise tower rooms -The Joint concert venue -All of the pools and Sunday REhab pool party -Free valet for guests -Really good food (Nobu, Pink Taco, Culinary Dropout, Mr. Lucky, etc) -Vegan eating options (including vegan benedict on room service) -Daily shuttle to the mall

My Pie literally allows me to make MY Pie the way I want it, and as a vegan that means a lot.   My Pie is similar to Chipotle or Subway concepts where you pick your crust, your sauce, your cheese, then your toppings and they cook it in an oven that's like 850 degrees. You have your pizza in like three minutes and it's amazing and crispy.   It makes me super stoked that they have vegan crust, sauces, and cheese. The marinara is fabulous.   Another perk is the buy-one-get-one-half-price beers. Buy one for $4 and get a second one for $2. They have several local drafts and cans.   The location is in a shopping plaza but My Pie itself is pretty cool and modern with opening garage style doors to allow the patio and inside to combine.   The staff is always friendly and quickly work you through the line.   Best $9 you can spend!

I've absolutely fallen in love with Modern Milk. Their prenatal yoga classes are absolutely fantastic; I'm addicted! I never liked yoga before I was pregnant, but the environment is so warm and supportive and the instructors give such a great (but appropriate) workout. I leave feeling so refreshed and more prepared for childbirth each time I leave.   I also appreciate the friendliness of the staff and instructors and the cute boutique items they stock in the shop. Their class prices are also incredibly reasonable and make it easy to attend regularly.

I have done barre at a lot of Studios, and I really like tenpoint5. I feel like I get a great workout every time and I really like the atmosphere. I am 4.5 months pregnant and took a class yesterday with Bebo... she took very good care of me and helped me to modify positions and always made sure I was safe. I highly recommend visiting tenpoint5 if you are interested in barre classes and want an excellent workout.

Super impressed with this place. The atmosphere is refreshing and "fresh." The staff is very friendly.   It is similar to a chipotle but with way more options. They have fish, shrimp, beef, steak, carnitas, chicken, and vegan picadillo as protein options which you can make into a salad, burrito, or bowl.   They have four different tortilla flavors, Mexican or cilantro lime rice, and black, pinto, or refrained beans. The sautéed spinach is delicious.   They have a huge variety of vegetables and 7 different Salsas as well. The tomatillo is delicious and the habanero is deliciously spicy.   Everything aside from the meat, cheese, ranch, and aoli is vegan... They are very veggie friendly here and they promote it which is awesome.   You can also get tacos.. They have 10 different taco options including a vegan option. They also have tortilla soup, chips, cookies, and a kids menu with quesadilla and chicken nuggets in addition to tacos, bowls, and burritos.  The food was really good, fresh, and left the three of us very satisfied! Don't forget to grab a loyalty card!!

I was really looking forward to trying this place because I'm vegan and it's super rare for me to get to go to an ice cream shop, and my step daughter has a lot of food allergies. We called to confirm the hours in advance, were told 10pm, and made the 20 minute drive there and arrived at 9pm. When we got there they told us they were closed and were out of product. *very frustrated face* It was really just one of those days where you need ice cream, so that fueled my agitation.   I'm really not sure how you can run out of the principal good you sell ... That's just bad inventory control. I'm sure that they lost a lot of business that night.. We saw three other groups turned away in the few minutes we were there.   It's going to take a lot for me to want to make the trip back and try again after the debacle.
