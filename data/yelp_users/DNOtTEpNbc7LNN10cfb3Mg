You can not pay me money to eat here again. They cannot even cook edamame, it was undercooked and cold. I had to stop eating their sushi in fear I would be sick for work in the morning. Texture and temperature of the fish scared me. Save yourself pain and throw your money out the window. Only plus side was their friendliness in service.

I recently visited this place with two of my friends who were even more disappointed with the food and the service than myself. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! You are better off paying your neighbor $31 to eat the dog poop in the front yard then to go to this restaurant. They forgot to fill up our drinks, the meat was not cooked nor seasoned. We let the manager know and he just said sorry we feel that way. He did nothing to resolve our disappointment. Again pass on this restaurant. You are better off at a place where you know the food is amazing.

Horrible service and unorganized. I should have listened to the reviews. Please don't waste your time or gas. The only positive what is the young gentleman and young female working the front desk that were nice.

Is there a negative star option on this? I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS PLAIN AND SIMPLE IF YOU WANT REALLY HORRIBLE SERVICE. GO HERE. If you want to wait for 20 minutes with no one offering you water..go here. I can't leave out the middle-aged blonde bartender with massive attitude who socializes and talk poorly about clientele. I've watch this go on for weeks and increase every single day. This is not a way to run a business in any industry.

I can't believe how well they turned everything around! The bartenders are amazing and I recommend eating outside or in the bar area. Again I'm just updating my review from last time and this place makes amazing sushi but it's the service that takes the cake!

I'm currently here in a business meeting and the service is phenomenal from our server Jenny and manager Erin. Thank you so much for the great food and wine...but most of all friendly service:)
