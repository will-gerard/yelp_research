I know good vietnamese food... I grew up in San Jose, essentially vietnamese central of the SF Bay Area... this is now my go to place in Downtown Phoenix. The prices are super reasonable... like for 2 spring rolls its $2.50... Pho Bowls are around $6 to 48. For my girlfriend and myself the bill came out to $25. Not too bad.... the customer service is real great too!

Hands down it is the best Breakfast place in the phoenix metro. I came all the way from Maricopa, AZ to check this place out. I'm not a native Arizonan, but this place competes up there with all the breakfast places I've been to. The pork chop is is awesome! I was lucky enough to be the last guy that made it through the door when it opened hehe.

It's pretty decent. It's clean, and the staff is on the ball. If you have ever been to a food court japanese place, the food is pretty comparable to that. That should be your expectation walking into this place. Typically this place is poppin during Lunch Time with the people coming from the Bank of America building next door.

Coming from San Jose, aka Little Saigon, I always thought anything out of the bay area was just ok. Except my mind did change over the last year or so when I started going to Pho Ao Sen with a co-worker. This place is just awesome! The broth is always the killer feature to set  pho-restaurants apart, and this place has always been consistent.   Customer Service is always great, and people are always greeted with a warm smile from the owner who's very personable as well as the staff.  Definitely a must-go if you have the urge for Vietnamese food in Arizona!

Skip it.... No taste and pretty bland. Don't skip, unless your a starving college student on a budget. They do give generous portions

Wow, I don't come out to Downtown Mesa too often, but found this gem on Main Street. I had the most perfect Turkey Club Sandwich there on this recent trip. Customer Service was just awesome, they were cheerful and very helpful. I'm definitely going to try this place again for dinner and I hear they host some special events.

I've been going to Vonn for a couple of years now, and I highly recommend her. She cuts the hair herself, so consistency has never been a problem. She's very personable and always with a winning smile. =)

Don't be fooled by the outside plaza, this place is good. Really good stuff. It has a mom and pop kind of a feel coming inside. Totally family owned.  Fresh and great ingredients. There is a spice factor multiplier here. I usually an handle my spiciness, but after coming here it definitely brought my A-game to a whole new level. If you feel like a "4" on the spicy level.. go with a 3! The food does take awhile to get prepared, so plan out your time accordingly. Pad Thai is great!
