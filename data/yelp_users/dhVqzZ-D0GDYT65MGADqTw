My wife and I had our wedding reception at the Wrigley Mansion in late 2013 and have dined there numerous times since. The setting is extraordinary. The reception (both the prep and the event) left nothing to be desired. And our subsequent dining experiences are consistent in good cuisine, good service and great ambiance. As far as down-sides, the menu is a bit more limited than many restaurants, though not more so than other higher-end ones. Also, we have noticed a little bit of turnover over time. However, the product, the service and the experience have remained consistently excellent. Highly recommend.

I am a shoe repair store regular, because I prefer to maintain a good pair of shoes rather than shop for a new pair. I tried this place when I first moved to the area. I have never been told quite literally that my shoes were not worth repairing. When I told the man that I had had the soles replaced several times before and that price was no issue, he told me it wasn't worth it for him and to go buy a new pair. So I took them a half mile down the road to Cobblestone and they had them looking like new in no-time.

My first stop-shop for any fixes and alterations. I have not yet had any major work done here or bought any suits from here, although I would if I were in the market for either of those things. This is a good old fashioned, local, family business. I've seen little quirky things happen here, like an order not being input into the computer, but I have also seen incredible care, competence, kindness and the type of family-owned, can-do attitude that can have alterations magically completed in under an hour.

I always want to like this place but I just can't. I'm fine with paying a bit more for great customer service, but the prices are significantly higher and often the customer service is no-where to be found. It is hard to navigate this store and my experience is that finding someone to help you is often as difficult as finding what you are looking for, if not more so. Another problem is with what the store calls "seasonal items." In other words, be prepared for the possibility that whatever you buy will not be returnable, even if it is unopened and unused. I have found that Ace does have a different / larger selection than Home Depot or Lowe's on certain specialty items (for example, signs and doggie doors). But I still begin with Home Depot or Lowe's first and visit Ace only as a last resort.

I must confess that I am a little surprised by the 2.5 star rating for this tasty and dependable, Cantonese American, family owned, neighborhood spot. (Based upon 7 reviews, as of 12/30.) Upon closer look, it is apparent that this seemingly low average is due to bad reviews by a couple of disappointed customers - who probably should not have been at this place in the first place. No, this is not a salad place. It is not a tofu place. It is not a vegetarian place. And it is not your friendly, sensitive, new age pan-Asian sort of place. It is a DELICIOUS, better-than-average, but not aspiring to be the best, gritty, unhealthy, high fat, high cholesterol, high sodium, high sugarm, high MSG, high everything, sort of place - with a good dose of cultural differences on the side. Just how we want it when, once in a while, we all get that craving. You know... the craving. Plus the young guys that usually work the counter are a couple of cool, hard working, dudes.

5 stars for AZ. As someone who's been to the Mediterranean and lived in Detroit, I know that it is possible to achieve a higher nirvana of Middle Eastern food. At the same time, some of Pita House's dishes (like the Chicken Shawarma sandwich, for example) are pretty much there. The interior seating area could be more comfortable and the hookah scene can be avoided altogether. Still, this restaurant is an absolute gem for enjoying a magnificent dish in the outdoor courtyard or via their quick and easy take-out.

A very nice experience overall. The place is comfortable and clean. Our server was helpful and friendly. The menu is a good balance of mostly traditional American-style Japanese fare with some creative twists. The service was quick but nor rushed. There was an understanding of the multi-step, multi-course, deliberative nature of proper Japanese ordering. And, lastly, everything was fresh, with a good balance of flavors and served at just the right right temperate (for example, not too warm and not too cold for the sashimi). Highly recommend.

In some circles, referred-to simply as "The Palace," this place has a solid lunch buffet and good service. Priced at about $10 per person for a variety of good Indian food, it's a lunch-time slam dunk every time... although adding a couple more dishes to the mix would be ideal. It's an OK value for dinner, although, in my opinion, slightly overpriced for good, but not out of this world, Indian.

Relative to Carnegie's in NYC, Langer's in LA, Zingerman's in Ann Arbor and other world class delis, Chompie's gets a 4. Relative to anything else in AZ, it's more like a 5. The food is on the mark, the selection is very good and the PV location ambiance and service are great. Plus one has to love the fact that it's a sit-down restaurant, a walk-up deli, a coffee shop, a sports bar and an outdoor patio all-in-one. The only draw-back seems to be the longer-than-average waits... no doubt a reflection on the popularity of the place. Although they probably could use a couple more workers in the kitchen and servers on the floor to handle the volume of customers.

Went in here for lunch for the first time the other day. Just thinking about it makes me want to go back today... and write a review. So let's cut to the chase: the sandwitches and coffee are great. The service is personal - by the owner. But what makes this place stand out is the attention to detail. Meaning, the ingredients they use: fine fresh bread, imported coffee, quality prosciutto and other deli cuts. And the extra care in the preparation of the melas and drinks. So FIVE STARS for the food and service. The location and ambiance could be better, hence the 4.

I have eaten lunch here a hundred times or more. I am floored at the 3 star average (at the time of me writing this). I have been to many Mediterranean restaurants... in the Mediterranean and in US cities that have Mediterranean culinary scenes far superior to Phoenix. So I have some frame of reference when I say that this restaurant is fantastic at what it purports to be - a hole in the wall gyro shop. I have always found the place to be clean, the owners to be friendly, the menu to be extensive and the food to be across-the-board delicious. Literally the ONLY downside is the long lines and limited seating at lunch, relative to the high demand. A sure sign to me that they are doing something right. So I try to arrive before or after the lunch rush. Problem solved. Cant't recommend it highly enough!

Some of the best Thai cuisine outside of Thailand. Period. Great service too. The staff is Thai (at least some of it) and happy to accommodate, so feel free to order off the menu, as I do. My only qualm - and this is a purely personal opinion - is that that there is something not quite Feng Shui enough about the layout of the place and the decor to form a perfect harmony with the great Thai food. So I generally pick up.

Ok. How to be diplomatic about this... Let me start by qualifying that I have not been here for dinner. So this review is limited to the lunch buffet... Although, in all honesty, the 2 experiences I have had with the buffet have left me with no desire to come back for dinner. Let me also also say that I can think of at least 10 better Thai places in AZ (basically every other one I've been to), which should pretty much say it all. In fact, I am not even sure that this place is really Thai - and not Chinese, for example. I mean, they have Tom Kha Gai soup, Pad Thai and a couple of other dishes resembling Thai cuisine, but they are not very good or authentic tasting. And they are interspersed with things like walnut shrimp, lamian noodles, eggs rolls, etc. Which leaves me very confused.

UPDATE: I previously gave this place 4 stars (see original post below) but there now seems to be new ownership, new name, new menu and a new indifference to the quality and flavor of food being served. What happened to this place??? (Note: please also search for ZK Grill at the same location. This is the new name and the reviews seem like a better reflection of the way things are right now.)  ORIGINAL POST: Bravo for any and all authentic, independent Middle Eastern / Mediterranean restaurants in this area! This one just happens to be delicious, use high quality ingredients, be family owned and operated, and reasonably priced. There is a common theme (maybe the saffron or another spice) that makes the dishes distinctive and consistent... but also a tad uniform. Still well worth a try!

Excellent local business. Very fresh, very creative, very flavorful and mostly locally-sourced (if I am not mistaken) dishes. And the difference in taste is palpable. A robust menu. Excellent service and ambiance. My go-to dish, the greek salad, is amazing. And other items are excellent as well. This is a very feel-good type place. My only qualm is the 3 pm closing time, because I would almost certainly frequent this restaurant for dinner.

There is a certain reality to these types of restaurants, which is that if a) the service is attractive and friendly enough and b) the food is at least average, then they can be excellent places to eat and hang out. Unfortunately, neither is is quite true in this case. When it comes to both food and service, there is this feeling like the place is simply going through the motions of a big, corporate chain. That used to not be the case when the restaurant first opened. However, there has been a perceptible decline, over time, as many of the early-generation staff members have come and gone. I really hope the place can get it together again, with some renewed attention to detail and customers. As for now, I would not recommend this restaurant except for the most rudimentary late-night dining and drinking needs.

Youfit is a utilitarian neighborhood gym, whose value proposition is quick, basic workouts without any of the fancy amenities of larger gyms. That's fine. The problem, I have found, is in the execution, resulting in the club failing to deliver on that value proposition. Let me explain...  One of the main attractions of this gym is the 30 minute express circuit, the rules and expectations for which are posted in the club and on the company website below. The company promises "complete full body workout and cardio" with "no waiting." And states: "If you are short on time this is the place for you.  Jump in and get going to maximize every spare minute that you have. This total body workout with cardio will never take more than 30 minutes and should leave you with enough time on your lunch break to still refuel." Excellent concept right?  Well, if the express circuit workout is the reason you are thinking about joining, as it was for me, know that the club does very little to actually facilitate this activity. Generally speaking, anywhere from one to one-half of the circuit stations are being used randomly at any one time by customers not doing the circuit. This creates a problem. Doing the stations out of order is a bit annoying but not hugely inconvenient. But if one or more of the stations are used for extended periods of times by two or more dude bros, each doing multiple sets of something, while male bonding in between sets... well that creates a timing issue that makes a 30 minute, full-body workout impossible. A simple sign saying that circuit doers have priority over random machine users seems like a simple enough solution.  I would be happy to change my rating if I see the staff make an effort to enforce the rules and make the circuit usable. But, as for now, it is very difficult or impossible to get what one bargains for at this gym - which is an express, full body workout in 30 minutes. So buyer beware.

I appreciate the club owner's quick acknowledgement of the issue (of the express circuit stations being occupied by non-circuit doers making the circuit difficult to use by circuit doers). I have every reason to believe that the concern will be addressed. The gym is more than satisfactory otherwise and has recently gone above and beyond in customer service in other areas. I recommend this business for its cleanliness, convenience and customer services. I simply add a caveat to ownership, members and prospective members that continued vigilance is required to keep the circuit usable, as promised. I will update as necessary.

This has been our go-to neighborhood eatery for almost 2 years. It is one of the best restaurants, if not the best restaurant, for miles around. The ambiance is warm and lively, with a dynamic, feel-good vibe and good, live music on the weekends. The dishes are creative and tasty. And this isn't just trendy, creative, unhealthy fare... There is something for everyone. The happy hour is a good value. The clientele is upscale but not pretentious. The staff is friendly. The hostesses are absolute gems and as helpful as can be - especially in having to deal with high demand at peak times. The specialty drinks are creative. Several of the servers and bartenders are highly professional and helpful. Others... less so. I am stopping short of giving the Salty a 5 because, in our many times there, there have been some areas of improvement. These include the service not being as good as what we have come to expect, certain areas of the restaurant being too loud, too crowded or too hot, and the kitchen running out of signature dishes - sometimes even early on in the evening. Again, a few areas of improvement over our many visits. And mostly related to the high demand on this place. I highly recommend this restaurant.

This restaurant made a big impression when it first went in. Having tried it a few times now, the takeaway is as follows: great concept, great ambiance, great service, limited menu, average food. The result is about 3.5 stars in my book, rounded up to 4 because Yelp doesn't allow .5's and also because this is exactly the type of innovative restaurant that should be encouraged around here, rather than repetitious chains and cookie-cutter restaurant concepts. Having said that, I don't often eat at this restaurant because I feel like it caters to a more... dilettante market segment. Which is to say that a decent wine / beer bar with a decent outdoor / indoor seating area only goes so far, and only for so long. When it is the only such place for miles around, that certainly helps its cause. What would really go a long way, however, is some delicious staple dishes. As it stands right now, there are about 4 or 5 choices of everything, with most items being wheat-based and with none being especially outstanding. For example, I had the tacos most recently and they were average at best. A few more breakfast options (such as omelets), a few more salad options, and a few more addictive late-night options would make me a regular for sure. Speaking of late night, what's up with the early closing times? A place like this should be open later than your "garden" variety family restaurant (no pun intended).

First, let me lay a little bit of foundation for this review... I am a self-proclaimed pizza expert that has had pizza in 5 continents, numerous countries, many US states, and all throughout the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. Specifically, I have tried virtually every new-age, custom pizza parlour to grace nearly every corner of Scottsdale and northeast Phoenix in the last few years. And so it is with proper perspective when I say that Fired Pie is the one such pizza place that simply gets it right. Fresh ingredients, perfect crust, perfect cooking time, good service... all that stuff. The only down-sides are that the dining area isn't all that comfortable (so it's more of an in and out operation, which is probably the intent), the plates are not readily available like the utensils (so one has to ask) and not all of the kids behind the counter always have their "head in the game" (so one has to be prepared to provide varying levels of hand-holding during the order). However, the end product and the overall experience are well-worth it. Highly recommend!

After wasting about 30 minutes at this place, I don't even want to dignify it by spending much more of my time on a review. Call ahead for inside seating was useless. Outside patio was filthy and uncomfortable. 5-10 minutes before a server even stopped by. Coffee takes another 5 and comes without cream. Takes another 5 for the server to come back by and another 5 to get the cream. By that time the coffee is cold. No talk of specials or of taking an order. Meanwhile, servers / runners are dropping food around us, coughing on food and generally looking sluggish, unmotivated and confused. Half of the customers around us are complaining about not getting their food. Others are sending food back to the kitchen. Went across the street to US Egg and had a reliable meal with good service and ambiance. Caveat emptor people!

The ratings for this restaurant (3.5 stars at the time of me writing this review) provide an interesting case study on how a few 1 and 2 star reviews can drag down the average of a restaurant that most everyone regards as a gem. But enough with statistics and on to the restaurant... Great ambiance. Special, creative cuisine. Excellent service. Sean, a server there, is regarded as one of the best in the business. We were his regulars at the Salty Sow and started coming to Toro when he made the move and turned us on to it. Overall, the restaurant is creative and excellent at everything we've tried. So come looking for a culinary adventure and prepare to be amazed.

Ridiculously good! Fantastic food. Family feel. Classic BBQ ambiance. Great service. Clean. The owner Pat: very hands on and all over the place, cooking up amazing creations, serving customers and stirring up good conversation. Oh and good prices. Awesome local business that genuinely cares about its food and customers. A real gem.

I've eaten here a number of times since the restaurant opened and have had a love-hate relationship with the place. At it's best, this a very good NY-style pizza parlour with great wings, good ambiance and excellent, friendly service. At it's worst, the pizza is below average, the wings are not edible, the wait is longer than it should be, the place echoes of screaming children, the staff seems careless and the food leaves a certain unsettling feeling afterwards. All in all, the word that most comes to mind is "inconsistent." Not downward trending, not upward trending, but simply highly inconsistent in my opinion... more so than any other restaurant I can think of. That's why I finally just gave up on the place. Don't get me wrong, you can bring your kid's little league team here and they will have a hoot of a time because they won't know the difference, because they can scream all through dinner... and because all pizza tastes good to 1 to 22-year-olds. But if you're looking for a decent bite to eat, I would not recommend rolling the dice.

There are some upsides to this place, such as decent lunch and happy hour specials and friendly wait staff, that make this an acceptable destination for a quick working lunch or a 6 Sapporo / sake, edemame and California Roll dinner. Anything more than that is sure to dissapoint anyone and everyone with an even remotely refined taste for Japanese cuisine. The sushi, sashimi and specialty rolls are generic and uninspired. The attention to detail, care in preparation and harmony of flavors - that generally make Japanese cuisine so special - is altogether absent. And the freshness, or lack thereof, is downright concerning. All of this is especially disappointing because this is such a good location and space for a quality Japanese place.
