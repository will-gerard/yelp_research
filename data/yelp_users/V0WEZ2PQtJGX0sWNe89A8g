Ladies and Gentlement, Start Your Engines!  You have 90 minutes to eat at the Tokyo Japanese Restaurant AYCE menu!  Ready-Set-Go!!!  My cousins were in town from Hawaii and we all wanted to get some Japanese food, but didn't want to fight the crowds at the large popular hotel chains.  Tokyo Restaurant is located about 1-2 miles off the main strip. First thing you need to know is that this restaurant is more home-style cooking. Restaurant owner, Becky, was a nice but a firm Korean lady.  She has owned the restaurant for 9 years.      I ordered the AYCE Dinner ($26.95) and was given a 90 minute time limit on my meal.  No problem.   All dishes are mini tapa-style plates, and the sushi orders are about 1/2 size of what is normally given in regular sushi bars.  Fun, as you can try many different things with plates this size.  Eat, to the pumping sounds of ABBA playing in the background.  Sashimi Plate:  A combination of hamachi, maguro, salmon, tai snapper, and several other fishes.  This was probably the highlight of my meal.  Nice fish and beautifully presented.  Grade:  A-  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tokyo-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#kg6j-ewkDX6ygzsDtUuRUQ  Grilled Hamachi:  A 3"x3" piece of grilled Hamachi yellowfin tuna.  The fish was a bit tough, not because it was over-cooked.  I don't know if it was the quality piece of meat.  Grade:  C  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tokyo-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#RPqgVOKjCs6iB2G4aCXhhg  Grilled Saba:  A 3"x3" piece of mackerel grilled.  Nice flavor, but again, may not have been the quality piece of meat.  Grade:  C  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tokyo-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#XM1z19dOYh5xOoXfnPCyJg  Spicy Sashimi Plate:  Koreans call this hwe dol bop.  It's a few pieces of fish sashimi tossed in korean hot paste, served on a bed of lettuce.  Fun to eat.  Grade:  B  Spicy Tuna Sushi:   Bits of tuna mixed with spicy sauce. Little flavor.  Grade:  C  Scallop Sushi: Paper-thin scallops topped sushi.  Grade:  B  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tokyo-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#T_QEUfdmEiP2-7o9JWCeLw  Shrimp & veggie tempura:  Two pieces of shrimp and three pieces of pumpkin tempura, served with a dipping sauce.  Another one of my least favorite dishes.  The shrimp was tough and chewy.  Grade:  C  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tokyo-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#cAB5ziDvm1ss_OaT4RiNaQ  Garlic Ahi sushi:   WAHOO!  This was the bomb!  This was maguro sashimi topped with some kind of garlic paste.  Delicious, flavorful, awesome!  Grade:  A!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tokyo-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#ghvX6UwmxCi6e46uaP_ZYg  Uni / Sea Urchin:  Delicous, but a bit skimpy serving of sea urchin.  Tasted like it was topped with a bit of truffle.   Grade:  A-  Uni Shooter:  A piece of uni in a shot glass, filled with ponzu sauce and spicy sauce.  Topped with green onions.  Grade:  B  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tokyo-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#Keu64HHs2kP4olzXFa17cw  Hamachi sushi: good pieces of yellow tail ahi served on a minimal piece of rice.  Grade:   B+  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tokyo-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#nMHxlfLj691YInD-HJX1IA  Ikura / Salmon Eggs:  Super salty (in a good way) salmon eggs, and again it tasted like it was topped with truffle.  Nice.  Grade:  B-  Amaebi / Sweet Shrimp:  Two pieces of sweet shrimp sushi, accompanied by it's heads being fried.   The shrimp was a bit old-tasting, but yet still fun to eat.  Grade:  B-  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tokyo-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#9bKQ1lDhjkmLWRTtWSknLA  Hamachi Lover Roll:  Krab sushi roll topped with hamachi.  Little flavor, not a favorite.  Grade:  C+  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tokyo-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#QrhveoJdp82xp_zkX4Z4Dg  The meal comes with ice cream - vanilla, green tea, and a few others.  What I liked best about the restaurant, was that it was a family-owned environment.  Everyone is welcomed.  One of the female patrons sitting at the sushi bar stood up and shouted.  Then she went around the sushi bar and ended up head-butting her head on the glass counter.   This caused 7-8 glasses of Sake-Beer shooter glasses (*prepared by the sushi chef) to foam immensely.  Everyone at the bar, including the sushi chefs, yelled GAMBATTE and everyone grabbed a glass and shot the sake-beer drink.  Lady - I hope your head is OK as that was a pretty big bang on the sushi bar.  Impressive!  Food Grade:  B / B+ Service Grade:  A-  (Thanks, Aaron!) Worth the money Grade:  B+ Overall Impression:

3.5 stars rounded to 4 stars!  Aloha Specialties Restaurant is the popular one-stop shop for local Hawaiian food when you visit Las Vegas.  The restaurant is located in the California Hotel and Casino.  You need to time your visit here (i.e., go early) because this place gets crowded!  I always wondered why Hawaii people would rush to a Hawaii restaurant in Las Vegas.  Don't we get enough local food at home?  It's all about comfort food.  Prices are reasonable, but the food preparation can take a while.  Be sure you have some good topics to talk with your table mates about.  Employees here work super hard to ensure you have a good experience.  Large Saimin Noodles:  This dish was just like eating local noodles at home in Hawaii.  The portions are quite large.  The saimin tasted like S&S saimin.  Although the noodles were a bit too soft and smooshy for me, it reminded me of my childhood.  Nice.  Grade:  B  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aloha-specialties-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#q_r79ge6x7EL_xu82rWY5Q  Chicken Curry & Rice:  This dish wasn't my favorite.  Period.  The flavor was right on, but the texture was a bit starchy and thick.  Not my style of local chicken curry.  Grade:  C+  Pork Tofu:  This dish was like home cooking!  Slices of pork cooked with onions, tofu, and served in a mirin, shoyu, and hondashi sauce!  WINNER!  Grade:  A!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aloha-specialties-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#_vF_tioidPEEiY4eFWmoCA  Spicy Korean BBQ Chicken:  The highlight of my dish was the grilled Korean BBQ chicken.  Three thighs were served with a whole lot of rice and a side of macaroni salad.  Well prepared, well cooked, delicious flavor.

Aunties Karen and Sandy own and run this Las Vegas Jerkys shop.  It's located inside the Las Vegas Club Hotel (head towards the back of the casino).  They do a WONDERFUL job with customer service.  Their products are excellent.  What I like best about this place (besides the wonderful customer service) is that many of their products have recipes that are rooted from the Islands.  That, coupled with the local friendly customer service, equals a WINNER!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-jerkys-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#ykPNkbsRAqmW0dgFsMioBg  There are literally 50-75 types of beef & pork jerkys to purchase here.  There are also wonderful candies, cookies, chips, lup chong, chocolates, etc. to purchase here.  I got so excited here, I literally spent $350 on goodies for my visiting relatives and items to bring back to Honolulu when I go back home.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-jerkys-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#qeyJ6o2dDKlmwlbBLduvcQ  Top of the list is the Islander Brand Lup Chong (Chinese Sausage).  These are traditional Chinese sausages that were originally crafted in Honolulu, and produced in Los Angeles, CA.  The owners purchased the rights to the recipe and produce the sausages for the store.  These sausages are thick and a bit on the sweet side.  Wonderful for fried rice, baked salmon with lup chong, or just eating along with steamed rice.  OMGDELICIOUS!  Get it!  Grade:  A+  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-jerkys-las-vegas?select=7Z2FHsyO9iv4FtD4clSIsQ#_GPmeVlAXT4xVMjgka_R_Q  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-jerkys-las-vegas?select=7Z2FHsyO9iv4FtD4clSIsQ#TT763Urq_CmdhbRuxch5Ww  Islander Brand Beef Jerkey is another favorite.  Comes in plain, spicy, peppered, pork, and spicy pork.  This is your traditional beef jerkey, but the flavors are out of this word.  Grade:  A-  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-jerkys-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#cEO3s2d_3MfdlDuvY29jsg  Islander Brand Sweet Dried Pork.  Aunty Karen calls this the jerky that taste like char siu.  These pork slices are cured and dried, and actually taste like you are eating sweet char siu (Chinese red roast pork).  The flavor is delicious, but the texture is a bit on the tough side.  Delicious, nonetheless.  Grade:  B+  Karen's Bagel Chips.  DELICIOUS!!!   Aunty Karen makes bagel chips that come in a variety of flavors - cinnamon sugar, blueberry, cranberry, plain, etc.  The most popular flavor is the cinnamon.  The bagel chips come in a container and must be hand-carried if you are traveling.  Fun to eat, flavorful, and crunchy!  Grade:  A  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-jerkys-las-vegas?select=7Z2FHsyO9iv4FtD4clSIsQ#aSXHyjkj03UU7dMOXyFiSQ  What I liked best about the store was that it was like shopping at home in Hawaii.  Both Aunty Karen and Sandy were super helpful in helping me put my order together and to make suggestions on what to purchase.  They were so much like family, they threw in a free apron and gave my family keiki toy cars when we were leaving!   AMAZING!   Mahalos, aunties!  Product Grade:  A- Service Grade:  A+ Worth the money grade:  A- Overall Impression Grade:  A!

This place is HUGE!!!!!   Literally, there are about 300+ different types of beef jerky to purchase here.  Everything from beef / venison / turkey / salmon / elk / venison / wild boar / pork jerky can be purchased here.  You can also get Hawaiian local candies and treats here as well.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-beef-jerky-store-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#vjBaCjsUQoD6TJzPeSwscQ  I ended up purchasing about 15+ bags of the stuff while shopping here.  It's fun to look around and figure out which jerkys you want to try (and those you need to give away as omiyage).  My favorite beef jerky was the Country Butcher Beef Briskey Jerkey.  It comes in four flavors - original, teriyaki, sweet spicy, and spicy.  What I like about this brand is that the jerky is super flavor and SOFT!  Gone are the days where you break a tooth on beef jerky.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-beef-jerky-store-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#0VJTAxdeVjn5_MFXa2Eb6w  It's like a rotating door here - TONS of people, and the lines to check out can get pretty long.  The proprietor looked like she was from Hawaii and offered a complimentary smile while I was checking out.  That's ok, the beef jerky is delicious!  They provide shipping on in-store or phoned-in orders.  Product Grade:  A+ (For the massive selection) Service Grade:  B Worth the money grade:  B+ Overall Impression Grade:  B+

Mandalay Bay is a great hotel on the outside strip of Las Vegas.  We stayed here for 4 nights, especially to hang out at the pools!  When you arrive, the bell hops and valets are very quick to grab your luggage and get you to the lobby to check in!  Super!  Our luggage arrived at our room almost 5 minutes after we arrived.  Super!  The Pools:  FUN!  There are 4 main pools:  1) The Wave Pool, 2) The Lazy River, 3) The general pool, and 4) a smaller pool.  The water is kept very clean, despite everyone's sun tan lotion and suntan oils constantly being put in the pool.  The life guards are young, which means that they aren't fully excited about their jobs.  Most of them just appeared satisfied to be there.  HUGE KUDOS goes out to LIFEGUARD TAMMY!  She is a very experienced lifeguard, who was constantly watching the guests like a hawk!  She made swimming in the pools very safe.  I even saw her helping a couple of handicapped, pregnant, and new mothers find seats in the very crowded pools.  She constantly cleaned up towels that the guests had laying around and left without picking up after themselves.  She was always looking to clean up after guests and to make it a very comfortable and safe place to relax.  Thank you Tammy!  The rooms in the hotel are large, clean, and newly updated.  The beds are comfortable.  I have two minor complaints about my stay:  First, I tried to call the front desk to ask a question and ended up calling twice.  The first time I called, it rang 15-20 times and no one picked up.  The second time I called it rang 15+ times and someone finally picked up the call.   My other complaint is that I called the Bell Service to help with our luggage at 11:30.  Checkout time is supposed to be 11:00, but we got a late checkout at 12:00.  After three calls to the Bell Service and after tipping one of the bell boys downstairs to lure him to the room to help us with our luggage, we were finally assisted at 12:45.  We waited ONE HOUR and 15 MINUTES for a Bell boy to help us with the luggage.  I realized that it was right after the peak time of checking out, but that was pathetic!

About $220 will get you a luxury room at the Hilton on a weekend.  This hotel was pretty nice, as it doesn't have a casino.  Hence, no noise, no smoke, no drunks.  It's a classy joint on the edge of the strip, so you don't get the unruly drunk crowds.  The rooms are spacious - King sized rooms with a large living room.  There is a kitchen which includes a fridge, stove, blender, coffee pot, microwave, etc.  Two large flat screen TVs - one in the bedroom, one in the living room.  And, they have a sauna-jet tub in each room.  NICE!   Staff are super nice and friendly.  The pool is HUGE and the lifeguards pay attention closely to the little tikes.  The areas are clean.  Parking is plentiful.  I'll be back!  Product Grade:  A- Service Grade:  A- Worth the Money Grade:  B+ Overall Impression Grade:  B+

Food or those who had a James Beard Award Nominee or Winner.  Nice comparison, huh?!  I got to Los Reyes De La Torta at 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon, and this place was PACKED!!!  I was quickly seated by two young and bubbly waitresses.  Did I mention that this place is always packed?!  I found out why!  I started my meal by ordering the Aguas cremosas - $4.50.  I ordered the Canteloupe (choices of  strawberry, mango, banana, papaya, or canteloupe). The fresh fruit was mixed with carnation and sweet cream.  It tasted like a canteloupe shake with delicious condensed milk!   INSANE!!!!

Four-and-a-Half Shiny Stars for China Mama Restaurant!  I'm super picky about my Chinese food because many of the restaurants cater to the Western palate.  China Mama is as authentic as it gets!  The restaurant is located off the main Las Vegas strip in a small strip mall.  The restaurant offers Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese food.  My table mates were very safe with their food offerings, but I threw in a couple of my favorites.  To start, we had the Mongolian Beef.  I didn't order this, but I'm glad that someone did.  The dish was created with very tender and flavorful beef sauteed with white onions, green onions, and a hint of garlic.  The flavor was outstanding, and I think this was the best Mongolian Beef that I've ever had!   Grade:  A!  The second dish was the restaurant favorite, Xiao Long Bao (XLB).  The XLB came out 8 to a serving and was served piping hot.  Each dumpling has a bit of juice in it and it had very strong flavors of ginger.  Delicious and fun to eat.  Grade:  B  The third dish was basil chicken.  Served in a little pot with a gel flame to heat the dish, the chicken was cooked with a soy glaze and heavy hints of basil.  I again didn't order this, but glad that someone did.  The flavors were bold and strong.  Grade:  A-  The fourth dish was stir fried green beans.  Typical string beans sauteed with green onions, garlic, and dried shrimp.  It was delicious!   They added additional flavors in this dish that made it taste more savory than the typical way it is presented in other restaurants.  Grade:  B+  The fifth dish was the spicy fish hot pot.  This dish can be ordered as non-hot or as bit arsh hot that you can stand it.  We ordered the dish as spicy.  The fish was generous, delicious and hearty.  There was cabbage (napa cabbage) below the fish.  The soup was presented in a soup-oil broth complete with spicy red peppers!  One thing that I missed about this dish was that it didn't have the typical szchuan peppercorns that numb the tongue.   The dish was spicy, but it didn't have the depth that it normally has with the peppercorns.  Grade:  B+  Service was great!  There was two main waitresses that worked the 20+ tables.  The younger of the two (daughter?) was very pleasant and allowed me to practice my Chop Suey Chinglish (I tried to speak Taiwanese / Mandarin / Cantonese all at once).  She understood me 100% and I had a good laugh!  The older waitress was a bit more serious!  This is a great place ot take family and/or friends.  They have an extensive menu of items (7+ pages of dishes!).  Food Grade:  B+/A- Service Grade:  B+/A- Worth the Money Grade:  B/B+ Overall Impression:  B+/A-

Cristopher's Restaurant (former  Crush Lounge) is a really high quality and fun place to eat.  I was in town for a conference and several of my colleagues recommended this restaurant.  Glad I went.  First, I have to start off this review by saying that the service here is OUTSTANDING.  Or, maybe just our waiter (John or was it David?) was the bombshadiggidy.  He immediately greeted everyone and learned our names (and used it throughout the night).  Super professional and funny service.  Awesome!  For appetizers, I had the Foie Gras pate.  It was served with bread and pickled vegetables.  Very traditional French, and very fun to eat!   Grade:  B  For my main meal, I ordered the Foie Gras Prepared Sous Vide.  This dish was well worth the hefty price tag.  It was delicious and well prepared.  Seared foie gras served in it's glory, accompanied by roasted brussel sprouts white and purple cauliflower, and plated with a delicious sauce.  Beautiful presentation.  Quality cuts of foie gras.  Grade:  A-  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/christophers-restaurant-crush-lounge-phoenix?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#RpUC0AEb0MeZNoJUwNPutg  I'm a fan!

My friends and I came here in a group of 15 to celebrate one of our big birthdays (number witheld).  We heard about it through all of the Travel Channel series.  What a FUN place.  This place puts you into two different "rooms" (converted freezers) to acclimate you to the dropping temperatures.  Before going into the rooms, you are given a choice of regular sweater parkas or the "delux" coats (extra fee) and faux fur hats (extra fee).  In the first room, they give you cotton gloves to keep your hands warm.   You then go into another room that it is a bit colder for a few minutes.  Then, they let you into HEAVEN!  The bar is made entirely of ice.  This includes the seats, statues, decorations, bar, cups, and picture taking area (ours was a Caddilac).  The bar and wait staff are very friendly and make it a fun experience.  They helped clear the Caddilac area and let the birthday boy strip down to his undies to take the picture with the group.  It was a blast.  Be sure to try taking a shot of your favorite drink out of the nekkid woman's boobies.  They pour the liquid into a funnel that is in the neck are of the ice-woman, and it comes out through slots in her two boobies.  You just stick your mouth there and gulp as the liquid comes out!  They have a range of drinks that you can choose from - mainly mixed drinks.  The drinks are tasty, but the ice cups only holds a few ounces.  Given that the drinks were $12-14 each, it didn't go a long way.  It's a bit expensive on the drink prices, but well worth the experience.   You can go in and out of the ice bar as much as you like - as long as you continue to order drinks.  FUN!  My FAVORITE part of the visit was sitting at the bar outside of the ice bar and ordering the "Dragon Mojito" (?)   That had to be the best mojito I've ever had.  It's an original drink created by the bartenders and perhaps the most popular.  They put that Dragon fruit liquor in it, which gives it a really different and nice tast.  I'm not a big drinker, but I had 3 of those drinks (in addition to 3 drinks inside the ice bar).  The fact that I wasn't drunk must have been a good indication that the drinks inside the bar weren't too strong and were made of primarily juices.  It's all about the experience, not the drinks!  I'll be back!  This place is FUN!  FYI - "Minus 5" means "Minus 5 below Celsius" (not Farenheight).  It's only 20-something degrees, not 5 minus zero like everyone thinks.  Great marketing ploy...

What a FUN store!  There are literally HUNDREDS of socks here.  The majority of the socks (800+ of them) are for women.  And, they have a side rack towards the back of the store that are men's socks.  For the women's socks, there are so many fun and different varities that you can choose from - long, ankle, toes, and knee high socks.  The styles range from sushi print, to hello Kitty to colorful to sexy.  The men's socks are also super fun, ranging from ninja warriors, surfers, buddahs, to bacon.  Women's socks range typically between $8-11 a pair of socks.  Men's socks range between $11 - 15 a sock.  This isn't cheap, but it's worth the fun that you get when you wear the socks and start conversations with friends and strangers!

A brightly lit and colorful candy store located in the indoor malls of Vegas.  Yes, the items in the store are very overpriced, but what can you expect when you shop at a mall in Vegas?  At least the cashier was super friendly and gave some great customer service!  This store has a lot of very nostalgic candies that are typically very difficult to find - Hunk bars, Rocky Road, Bottlecaps, Violets, Dots, etc.  My favorite was the bacon section - back bandaids, bacon pop rocks, bacon cotton candy, bacon toothpicks, bacon breath mints, etc.  They also have a section of adult candies - penises of every size, color, and shape; boob candies of every cup size and flavor.  They even have flavored condoms.  OK so what is my gripe?  I don't think that this store should be marketed as a kid's candy store.  Our group went in with one 6 year old, two 8 year olds, and one 9 year old.  Although they found handfulls of candies to buy, the parents had to do a lot of explaining of what a 8" cock lollipop was, what strawberry flavored lickable condoms were, and why people would want to  eat candies that look like tits.  The marketing plan of this store is off, as it clashes a colorful kid's candy store with adult porn-inspired candies.  It's not appropriate for kids to shop at this candy store.  Either make this a candy store for kids (there are TONS of kids who will shop here) or make this store an adult porn candy shop.  The two don't go together.  And, the owners don't warn parents of the adult-themed items before coming into the store.  Product Grade:  D Service Grade:  B Worth the Money Grade:  D Overall Impression Grade:  D

I haven't been to Buca di Beppo in years, and I recently had the opportunity to eat at this restaurant with my friends here in Vegas.  From the moment you walk into the restaurant, there is tons of excitement and energy!  Love it!   First, you have to set expectations before eating here and writing a review - it is a family style restaurant that caters to large groups.   This is not a James Beard Award Winning restaurant, but it is a fun place for groups to grab a meal together.  I called in to make a reservation for 8 people at 7:00 p.m. and Miss Hostess was the nicest person I've encountered in a long time!  Easy Peasy!  When we got to the restaurant, we were greeted by three lovely hostesses.  We were told to wait 5 minutes for them to set up our table (HUH?  The restaurant was half empty!).  After being seated, we were quickly greeted and served by lovely Miss Server Shennae!  For starters, we got the Apple Gorgonzola Salad (Small for 4).  The salad was your typical green salad but was loaded with gorgonzola cheese, thinly sliced Granny Apples, walnuts and cranberries.  It was light, fresh, and tasty!   Grade:  B  For the main dish, we got the Frutti di Mare Pasta (Small for 4).  The pasta was topped with mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari.   The pasa noodles were tossed with a rich and spicy marinara sauce.  I loved the taste of this dish.  I didn't like the texture of the noodles.  It tasted like either the noodles were over cooked or were a cheap brand of noodles.  The texture was mushy and did not have a chew to it like most noodles should have.    Grade:  B-  The kiddos at the table ordered from the kid's menu ($5!).  Each had a personalized sized cheese pizza or spaghetti and meatballs.  Both selections were VERY generous and large!  The pizzas were 9" across.  The spaghetti and meatballs was served in a medium sized pasta bowl and looked like it was enough for 2 adults.   (It looked so tasty, I wanted to eat the leftovers of the kids, but I refrained!).   Grade:  A!  Best part of the meal was the energy and smiles of Miss Server Shennae!  She was patient and really made it an enjoyable evening!  You can tell she loves her job!  Thanks a bunch, Shennae!  Food Grade:  B Service Grade:  A! Worth the Money Grade:  B-  (sorry, the bad pasta noodles and prices did this) Overall Impression Grade:  B

Citizens Kitchen and Bar is located right in the mall, located close to the Mandalay. With 8 people in our party, we were seated very quickly at 7:00 pm on a Monday night.  The menu isn't as big as most restaurants in the surrounding area.  They have your typical bar-inspired foods - burgers, salads, soups, sandwiches, and a few selections of meat (stone chicken, skirt steak, prime rib, etc).  Let's start off this review on a positive note.  Our server, George, was AMAZING!  He was very polite and patient with all of his customers.  He was very knowledgeable about the dishes and provided EXCELLENT customer service!  Thank you!  (George - here's a professional hint - when you serve tables of 6+ in the future, please inform your guests that there is an automatic gratuity of 18% already added in the bill.  There were 4 young kids and 4 adults at our table, and we trusted you enough to not check the bill close enough.  On top of your 18% automatic gratuity, we added an additional 20% tip on top of the entire bill because we weren't aware of the tip policy.  Hope you enjoyed your 41.6% tip ($85 tip on a $210 total bill)!   We weren't entirely mad because you did provide some excellent service!).  This place is CRAZY LOUD.  There was a group of 5 ladies sitting at the bar yelling and screaming at each other, enjoying themselves.  My guess was that they were feeling good because of the day's intake of libations.  I was a bit dissapointed that the bartender didn't ask these ladies to quiet down a bit.  Some even used language that were inappropriate for people with families.  Welcome to Las Vegas.  The food was a bit of a dissapointment.  We were excited to see that they had a fixed price meal for people who were attending the shows nearby.  For $29, you got a choice of an appetizer (Cesar salad or French Onion Soup), a main course (18 hour prime rib, stone chicken or pasta), and a slice of chocolate cake.   I've been shying away from eating too much red meat, but prime rib is done well here in most of the Las Vegas restaurants.  I opted for the Cesar Salad, the prime rib, and chocolate cake.  The Cesar salad was very nice.  It was a generous portion of salad that had a delicious dressing.  I could have eaten this salad as my entire meal.  Kudos!  The prime rib was pretty bad, as it was served lukewarm cold.  The fat parts of the meat were congealed because the meat was not served hot.  The prime rib is advertised as 18 hour cooked with rosemary.  There was little taste in the meat and it was a bit on the tough side.  I ended up giving most of my meal away to others on the table.  The chocolate cake was what you can expect from a restaurant.  The cake was a bit on the dry side, but the frosting was nice and was not overly sweet.  Food Grade:  D+ Service Grade:  B+!  Thanks George!  Enjoy your $81 tip! Worth the Money Grade:  D+ Overall Impression Grade: D+

Dropping my rating from a two star to a one star DISASTER!  I just wrote a review for the Citizens Kitchen & Bar last week.  I mentioned that the waiter George was "AMAZING!"   I retract my statement.  He is unethical and unprofessional.  He automatically included an 18% tip in our bill (see my original review) and not tell us about it (he got a 40% or an $80 tip on a $210 total bill).   We would have been OK with the 18% tip for a party of 8, but just tell us about it so we wouldn't double tip you!  We just checked our credit card statements, and George DOUBLE CHARGED us when we asked him to split our bills.  This means that he charged us 150% for our food and drink bill!  UNETHICAL!  Here's a summary of this horrible restaurant:  1)  We weren't told that Waiter George included an 18% tip on our bill. 2)  We added an additional 20% tip, raising his tip to $85+ on a $210 bill. 3)  We were charged an additional 50% for our food, bringing our total charge to $300+ on a food tab of $168. 4)  To top it off, the food is HORRIBLE here!  AVOID!  Shame on the owners and wait staff of Citizens Kitchen & Bar!  We're working with the credit card companies to resolve this mess!  Food Grade:  D+ Service Grade:  F Worth the Money Grade:  F Overall Impression Grade:  F!

WHAT?  Five Stars for a Car Rental Place?!  Yes-sir-ee!!!  I travel a LOT for work and am always renting a car.  The service here at Enterprise is top notch!  The employees are super friendly and helpful.  I got in and out in a jiffy, and everyone was super nice!
