Grading scale: 0-3: Food Quality 0-2: Service Quaity  I was quickly greeted when I walked in and they were very friendly.  I asked if they had specific menu items because their menu was huge and I was starving. They knew what they had and didn't have RIGHT away with no hesitation at all!  I ordered the orange chicken and asked if I could get it super spicy. I also ordered the crab puffs.  I got home and saw that I never god my crab puffs so I was a bit upset about that.  The "spicy orange chicken" had its flavor spikes but there was nothing that resembled any kind of spice. Overall it was not what what I ordered and I didn't receive the other item.  it's hard to rate the crab puffs because I didn't get them but I was charged 5 bucks for them.  I didn't get a fortune cookie in the bag which is not necessary I guess but I have never gone to a Chinese takeout place where they have not provided one.  Food Quality: 1 Service Quality: 1

I go here with 3-4 other friends, get the FAMILY MEAL, you pick out 3 entre's 2 sides and it feeds us all easily with some left overs. it's also only 20 bucks. it's amazing quality and extremely cheap when you get the family meal.

0-3 stars for food quality 0-2 stars for service  Staff greeted everyone very nicely, even though it was busy, they all were kind and highly professional when it came to customer service.   They pumped through the line and answered all of my questions as I have never had a perogi before.   They gave accurate waiting times, 10 minutes, to everyone that was there.   I got the sausage plate with a beef, chicken, and pork perogi. They also make their own fresh seurcrout.   Their soda machine didn't have ice.  I said it was OK but the soda pretty warm too   The Polish sausage was well packed and tight.  But it was not seasoned well  The dough was well boiled and seared on 1 side.   The filling of all 3 was quite bland.   2 -  food would have gotten a 3 if it was seasoned and if they had ice 2 -  staff was amazing

Pretty close to the best crab puffs I have ever had. The delivery was supposed to take 30 minutes according to what they quoted me, it took 60 minutes. The chicken was soggy and dry, overcooked chicken with under fried breading. I asked them to make it  "extra, extra, extra, extra, super duper spicy. as spicy as you can make it" and it was the most bland tasting breaded chicken I have had and not even close to spicy. The lo mien was spicier than the GT's chicken.  I would go back if I only wanted crab puffs but that's it.

0-3 stars for food 0-2 stars for service  First impression was great!  Family sharing food off to the right and they looked happy.   I was doing takeout and was greeted by 2 females. The awkward moment came when I had to ask for a menu,they didn't even ask if I wanted to eat here or takeout.   They don't have lunch specials on the weekend but that wasn't stated on the menu.   Different sizes of meals and appetizers not listed on menu  They gave 2 free egg rolls with the meal but they are bitter and soggy on the inside.  It also has a smokey taste  I got home and they didn't even give me my wallet shrimp. After digging through everything it turns out that they gave me wonton soup.  The crab puffs are greatly filled but it's not crab.  Not even imitation crab.  It's more liquid that came out of a piping bag.   I was hungover and didn't want to deal with it anymore. I drove by the place.  Dropped off the soup and went somewhere else.   0 - the food because I didn't get what I ordered and the crab puffs had 0 crab in it.   0 - they got my order wrong and didn't offer me a menu.   I can't give a 0 so 1 star it is
