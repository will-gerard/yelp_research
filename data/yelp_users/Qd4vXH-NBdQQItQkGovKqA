Do not get the taco salad!! Way too much guacamole and sour cream and it is really bland. Kind of a mess.  friendly service, cute little neighborhood atmosphere, but honestly the food is not impressive.

This place is fantastic. Me and my coworkers eat here at least once a week..  Super fast, awesome food, and great service. The owner is so friendly and I'm pretty sure he never leaves, like, ever. A tip: get here early if you want California rolls, they run out toward the end of the day.

Seriously I am not sure if these people sprinkle prozac on their cappuccinos or what happens inside of that little hut but the employees at this location are consistently incredibly happy and so genuinely nice. It brightens my day to go to a business where the employees seem like they truly enjoy working there! The coffee is fantastic, service is quick, you leave with a smile. 5 stars for sure.

I was so incredibly impressed with my experience with Paul at Golden Rule! I came in with the less-than-impressive beginnings of an outline for an idea I had in mind and Paul turned it into a masterpiece! And he free-handed the entire thing! Everyone at the shop was incredibly nice and helped distract me toward the end when i was shaking and in so much pain and the end result is a piece of art on my arm that I will forever be impressed with. I cannot say enough good things. Thank you Paul and thr entire staff for an amazing experience!
