I have always had a pretty good experience at Danny's. They are a pretty well-oiled machine. I was a little nervous after the raid that things would have changed but it wasn't bad! I was in and out in 10minutes. I liked that I was able to tip the guys that actually worked on my car. My only recommendation is to be patient, Danny's probably had to turn over their entire workforce so it might take some time for them to get up to speed!

I absolutely did not have the same experience as the other reviewer. My experience with Toyowest and the Cahills started when I called for an estimate on my used Lexus IS 250.  Roger was very knowledgable and clear about costs associated with the repairs I needed including labor. Since I needed all of my brakes replaced, he recommended a brake system flush. He emailed me the price estimate, broke down all pricing and even explained that they are a little higher priced with their tires than other major tire companies because they are a small shop. Since I needed both tires and brakes and was willing to pay for the convenience of having it all done in one visit - I went with them. Roger even drove me to work himself when I dropped off my car.   In the end, I went with only replacing my front brakes as he called to update me that I could wait to replace the rear brakes (who else does that?).  I will definitely be returning to this honest and customer-service oriented, family-owned and operated business for my remaining repairs.   I hope you try them out too. As a daughter of a mechanic, I know what it means to have a reputable person taking care of your car.

Went for lunch and thought the pizza was great! The build your own is a little pricy but they have a good selection of signature pizzas. We will definitely b back.

Located in a busy plaza next to a busy bar and workout space, this place seemed pretty popular even with a Denny's in the same parking lot. What I liked is the quaint, café feel and samples of gluten free pastry's.  There was a case along the side of premade items for purchase as well.  I liked the breakfast options.  I went with the breakfast sandwich on an English muffin.  I wish I had the option of an over easy egg but they used a premade egg which kinda stinks but was still tasty.   We also got potato chips which I thought was odd. Would have preferred half a banana or some grapes (just throwing it out there!)  I didn't get any of their pastry's but judging by their samples you would not be disappointed!

Visited 5.27.2012 (@2:45pm)  This is only the second time that I have eaten at this location and my boyfriend and I had pretty terrible service.  When we walked and asked if we could sit outside the hostess handed us menus and told us to sit wherever.  So we did. We sat there for about 15 minutes.  A few waitresses smiled at us but no one asked if we had been helped.   Finally, a waitress came over who didn't know the price differences between domestic or foreign beer - only new the specials.  Then she left to find out how much a Kiltlifter draft would be - $6 (kind of pricey) but my boyfriend ordered one anyways.  I ordered a bloody mary.  The drinks seemed to take a long time and the waitress explained that my bloody mary was what was holding things up. Truthfully it wasn't busy at all and the bartender should have had no problems pouring a draft beer and mixing vodka with bloody mary mix pretty quickly.  When the drinks came (brought by a different waitress) there were no garnishments for my drink.  I had to get up to get my own (no bloody mary bar either).  The food came, again from a different waitress, but we had no napkins or silverwear.  I stole one off of the table next to us and went in for another. When I asked the bartender - he told (rather rudely) a waitress to "get her a place setting."  I was really appalled by the way he spoke to her.  We started eating and the original waitress stopped by to see how our meal was and the food was pretty good so we both said good.    When the bill came I was pretty disappointed that the waitress did not inform us that there would be an up-charge for sweet potato fries.  So his burger and my Caesar chicken wrap were $13 each.   Having been to many downtown restaurants where I have received great service I could not let this experience go by without saying something.  I regret not saying something at the time but the staff didn't seem to appreciate our patronage in the first place.  Go to Arrogant Butcher if it is open instead.  S~

I've been meaning to check out nami for a while now so we finally popped in this past Sunday as we are doing a vegan challenge. They have really yummy vegan desserts! If you are thinking of using the wifi though its pretty spotty but otherwise a great place to chill! On Sunday evenings they have live music as well which is nice.

I am absolutely in love with this place. If you are looking for a spot to chill, maybe put your earbuds in and work a little, or catch up with some friends - this is your place. Owned by the same guy who owns St Francis, it's a classy place to grab a beer or a coffee. The bathrooms are dope too. Nothing super special, but unique and fitting. They pay attention to detail.   The only reason I give it four stars instead if 5 is for their menu. I wish there were seasonal specials. I realize it probably keeps costs down to not invent new specials but even like a flatbread? The 18$ roasted salmon plate just doesn't fit here. I come frequently and the menu seems stagnant.   Don't get me wrong the food is uh-mazing. Everything we've had is great. The Mediterranean and the chino salads are great. My fiancé loves the pork chile verde pot pie and the grilled cheese is total comfort food (I suggest adding tomato or avocado).  If you haven't stopped by this gem in downtown I highly recommend it!
