This place was fantastic!  I have been searching for an authentic Mediterranean place for a while now and have come up less than impressed.  Saba's totally changed that though!  Fantastic food, great customer service, the staff was so friendly and helpful.  They have items on the menu I haven't seen at other places that I've been craving!  It was a little hard to find for some of the people who were meeting us there but once there everyone was very pleased with the results!  Thank you Saba's for adding to my "I will be back" list!

Exactly what you would expect from a local bagel joint. Clean booths and tables. Fantastic coffee hot and ready to go. The bagels and lox hit the spot!

My grandparents love this place!!  I am originally from Minnesota and we had a place called Perkins. This feels like Perkins ran away with a French man and had a baby. The food is standard to what you would see at an average American restaurant but with a French flair. I've had a few different things since it's one of my grandparents favorite places to eat. The pot pie is massive so be sure you go hungry. It's good but you really need to be ready for a large meal. They have decent sandwiches but nothing I've had has really blown me away yet. I really enjoy it because my grandparents enjoy it. If you need somewhere to take your parents or grandparents this is the spot!!

You would think a smoothie place would be over the moon to have someone walk in with an order for 10 smoothies.   No. Upon ordering I was told the next time I come in with an order like that they will tell me "no."  In my mind companies should be in the business of doing business, making money and providing the highest level of customer service.  This specific order was for a VIP customer of my own to help them have an awesome day after finding out they were having a rough one before our meeting I thought it kind to go above and beyond to show up with something refreshing on a hot day to turn their day around. The very last thing I hope for when I go to spend $50 on smoothies is to be told that next time I try I will be told "no."   Thank you Jamba Juice but next time I will take my business elsewhere simply out of principle.

Pizza is fantastic but be sure to order the classic crust. The thin crust is not as good as the nellos classic.   Very fast service, and my favorite pizza joint in town. The classic cheese you can't go wrong with but order up a sausage pepperoni and you will be in heaven.

LOVE the food here!!!!  The queso comes with the most amazing crisps!!!!    Fantastic service and people. The food no matter what you order always comes out tasting outstanding. If you are in the mood for quality food, great people, and a fun local scottsdale spot this is your place.

Fantastic bagel place!  Quick and get the order right each time. I would love to see them carry other milk options for coffee but the bagels are so worth it. Great hometown feel and portion sizes are generous. Very friendly service.

I think I must have gone on an off night. The food was not good. The chicken was very very dry and slightly difficult to eat. It was fast and easy which was what we were looking for at the time but the food was unappetizing. The service was great and friendly.

Wasn't very impressed. Waited for a while to get a table. Finally got a spot and the server was clearly annoyed we were not drinking alcohol with our meal.   We ordered traditional spaghetti and meatballs that was pretty standard. We also ordered fish that was way over cooked. Great location but just not the best experience.

Best beef cheese steak sandwich EVER!  This place is adorable. The name is very fitting as you can get just about any shape pasta noodle you can imagine.   The icing on the cake is the sandwiches though. Served on Italian bread that is as standard soft and fluffy inside with a slight crisp to the outside. The deli has fantastic cheese and meet options.   Topher (the boyfriend who I will now call by name since he is almost always with me when I visit new places) had the Italian sausage and peppers sandwich that he too greatly enjoyed.   Casual, classic and a must stop stop.

This place was fantastic!  It is open late which is always nice.  They have a full bar for those who want to continue with the nights festivities but they also have OUTSTANDING coffee!  It is the kind of place where you can hang out for hours and go back for a few cups so come either with good friends or a good read.  I plan on going back to try the food but unfortunately, only went for late after dinner coffee this time around.  I love that you can see them cooking right there in front of you.  Can't wait to go back!

Is it possible to give it a lower star?   My family decided to do Chinese take out on Christmas Day.  5 days prior I called to see what their process was for placing a take out order. I specifically asked if submitting my take out order would help with their holiday rush. They said it would definitely help and I proceeded to collect our family's order and call them back later that day with details.   Christmas Day had arrived and we had planned on picking the order up at 5:00. Grandma moo moo was very worried we might be late so we arrived at 4:40 just to be safe. We went inside the already VERY busy restaurant and gave them our name. They said it would be up in a few minutes and asked us to pay right away so we didn't have to worry about paying once we got our food.  The following is a breakdown of our full experience.   4:40pm: Pay and told it would only be a few minutes.  4:55pm: Overhear a woman beginning to raise her voice to the hostess only to find they told her a table would be ready in 10 minutes and she had been waiting for 65 already.  5:00pm: start seeing various take out orders appear from the kitchen. Grandma moo moo asks each time if they are for us.  Nope.  Overhear a man yelling about how it's crap he pays then is told nothing for another hour after his food was said to be up. Do not feel optimistic about the experience ahead.  5:15pm: Learn from a little girl who had been waiting 45 minutes for a reservation they had made for 4:30 that the fish in the fish tank is called a puffer fish.  Cool....now where the heck is the take out food. Moo moo is going to start worrying about Grandpa being at the house with guests showing off his toy trains for this long.  5:30pm: Man wearing bright patterned fleece PJ pants and fluffy slippers comes in for his 5:30 take out pick up.  He does not seem pleased when he is told it isn't ready.  5:45pm: Pretty funny to see a grown man in public sitting at the bar in fleece pj pants and fluffy slippers drinking a beer.   6:00pm: Realize the other people around us haven't gotten their food yet either and ask how early they ordered. 3 days was one reply and 2 days was the other.  6:10pm: Mr. 3 days early starts getting mad explaining he has 16 people at home waiting for food that was for pick up at 4:45. He demands a discount and they give him coupons for his next visit....sorry but based on his angry red face I don't think there will be a next time.  PJ pants and fluffy slippers is on his second beer.  6:15pm: Grandma moo moo and I text the family and ask them if a gas station chicken would be good. Drum up some support when we throw in we could also pick up slushies.  Proceed to ask if they could check on our order and see the gal walk away and avoid us as best she can when she returns. No answer received.  6:20pm: Mr. 3 days gets his food while apologizing to wife for 3rd time about delay, "No honey, I didn't get lost they really were running this late!"  Poor guy.  6:22pm: The food has arrived!!!  Pj pants and fluffy slippers is on beer number 4 I think.  6:23pm: Mr. 2 days asks if he can buy our take out for double the price since he's sick of being pestered by his super hungry family back at the house. Moo moo declines.  6:33pm: arrive back at Moo Moos where upon arrival my Grandfather welcomes her with big hugs and lots of concern as it's not often they are apart that long.  We can hear the toy trains are still going strong in the den where he had the rest of the family watching while they waited for food.  Family seems so pleased about the food they don't mention the exciting model train display. I trust it was awesome.  6:35pm: Realize we are missing one whole order of veggies and the extra rice we had requested. Oh well too hungry to care anymore.  Sucks for my vegetarian aunt though.   7:00pm: After woofing down food faster than I have in a long time, I proceed to finish it all off with my fortune cookie.  7:01pm: Cookie reads: "Your honesty will take you far."  Ha....me maybe but I don't think it will be helping the Jade Palace much.   Next year - we are trying a different spot. What a mess.

Before I moved to AZ I would make sure I had time to get gelato and a sandwich here!  It is amazing and the family who owns and operates it are amazing!  Some of the best food and treats I've ever had!

Fantastic pizza and great service. I stopped in pretty late starving because I meant to eat earlier. Not only did they still seat me but I had my meal in no time. I ordered a small side Caesar salad and a personal sized pizza. Some of the best pizza I've had in a long time. The servers were friendly and fast. A pleasant experience for a late evening stop.

I am a huge thai food fan and typically I am pleased with just about anything. I had take out from here and made an attempt to have a friend try thai food for the first time. I figured it would be a good spot to order some of the classics from. Sadly the food was not very good at all and I think I have officially caused someone who was willing to try something new in terms of food to really hate the idea of trying anything outside of the norm. I tried to explain it wasn't that good but now they are convinced they must not like Thai food. Big bummer.

I've been here a few times and keep going back.  I'm such a sushi fan so I naturally gravitate towards the sushi menu.  I will say their sushi is not the best.    HOWEVER! They have some of the most fantastic Japanese food that doesn't include sushi that I have ever had.  The miso soup is amazing.  I'm very picky about my miso soup and this one is probably the best I have tried.  They have a seasoned broccolini on the menu that we were hesitant to try but opted for it since it sounded like such an interesting blend of flavors.  It was FANTASTIC!  Their fish is top of the line and seasoned just right.  The portion sizes are perfect and the hot jasmine tea is a must with the fish.    The service the first time I went about a year ago was sub-par.  I've been back a number of times and haven't had an issue so they must have made some sort of positive change.  The atmosphere is beautiful as well.    Great spot but if you are a traditional sushi fan step outside of your comfort zone on a Japanese menu and try some of their regular dishes.  You will not be let down.

This is my favorite place to eat!!!!  The food is amazing!  Such good flavor!  The Penang curry with the forbidden rice is my very favorite meal. The place is a little off the beaten path but so worth the stop!

Two words......breakfast burritos!!!!  When all a girl wants is an authentic breakfast burrito mediocrity just won't cut it. They make one of the best breakfast burritos in town!  They are fast and friendly.   If you're an horchata fan don't miss out!  You can tell they make it from scratch!   Nom nom nom is all that really needs to be said.

Fantastic food!  We had the quiche and croissant breakfast sandwich. Both were outstanding and ample portion sizes. The place is very small and quaint. The crust on the quiche was to die for!  It was the perfect flakey crust you expect out of a quiche.

Easy and quick. The best part is if you are stretched for time you can go halfway to the first marked lookout spot and still experience a great view. Hikers of any level can make it all the way to the top and the views of scottsdale and fountain hills are outstanding. It's well traveled but not a busy trail. You can go and see only a handful of groups. Great trail to hit up if you want some peace and quiet that is close to town.

Beautiful selection with a helpful knowledgable staff. Can't find what you're looking for? They even help send you in the right direction to find the exact piece you have in mind. Not many stores do that.   Great cornerstone for the community. They support all the local shops and the overall care of the area. Prices are better than what you would find online and the one of a kind pieces make it worth the drive over.

This place is very loud inside. They have TVs in all the right places though so if you are going for sports watching it's a great spot.  The food is lacking though. Very bland and nothing that I've tried in the multiple times I've been stands out as anything worth going back for. The service is great if it isn't a busy game night.  I've had everything from salads to burger/sliders and it's all run of the mill bar grub.

This place is fantastic!  The outdoor seating is great. The food is clean and very healthy. They have so many options!  I had the ginger agave soda water drink that was great to start off the night. The hostess recommended the hummus plate that came out very quickly. The pita was warm and the hummus was loaded with fresh herbs and veggies. The waitress was very helpful but having gone solo for this outing I was pretty full from the hummus and opted for their chicken chopped salad. It was GREAT!!!!!  It was a very large salad for just one having just had the hummus. The service was fast and very friendly. They are all very knowledgable of the menu and nutritional details.  It's the kind of place that makes you want to eat clean!

FANTASTIC SUMMER PATIO!  I typically don't want to give up my favorite summer patio spots because here in AZ a good shaded patio is often hard to come by.  I just love this place so much I felt I was doing an injustice by not writing about it!   The patio is shaded with misters.  The food is really great quick lunch fare (they also serve breakfast but I haven't tried it yet).  What steals the show in the summer along with the patio is the lemonade that I traditionally like to mix with the blackberry jasmine tea.  I am officially addicted!   Taking a large glass out to the over-sized seating on the patio under the misters on a beautiful summer day is the best because their patio is shaded by the building.  It's not a large patio but it really is such a peaceful spot!    The food is very yummy and the big pro is most of it is exceptionally healthy.  They use fresh ingredients, and have unique salads.  The jalapeno avocado hummus is a must try.    Of course I can't help but mention what a wonderful staff they have.  I'm finding on the hot days when most people just want to go home and chill in the comfort of their AC the staff at The Herb Box is friendly, kind and welcoming.  I appreciate this as I know it is hard for businesses to make it through the rough summer months here in AZ.  Thanks guys for doing what you do!

Fantastic BBQ at a very unlikely spot. Most people don't expect to have a gas station with such an outstanding menu. What I love best is as you wait in line there are adorable items for sale in the shop they have. Awesome gifts!!!

It took them forever to make my sandwich. It was ok but not the best quality meat. The set up and process to order is cute and a fun experience but the food itself was a little overpriced for what you get as well. I would look at it as a lower on the list sandwich stop.

Mole mole mole!!!!!  If mole is what you want this is the place. For starters I am NOT a fan of regular mole. My boyfriend loves it. Of course this menu had other options. While ordering the waiter suggested my boyfriend try the mole flavors.   Amarillo "yellow" Mole - is amazing!!!  I took a little try of the samples that were brought over and realized wow!  I love yellow mole!!!  It lacks the chocolate tones and has more of a fresh taste. So yummy!   For all you mole lovers out there - my boyfriend had the enmolades and he loved them.   Fantastic food!  Fantastic service!  An adorable little spot.

I have been searching for a coffee shop that stands out since moving down to AZ from Minneapolis. I've found a ton of average spots that feel run-of the mill and when I came across altitude I was pleasantly surprised!    The shop itself is a little small and could use some extra space but it has everything a classic coffee shop should have. A friendly staff (complete with fantastic mustache on the man who roasts the beans), a bean roasting machine there in the store, cozy tables, perfect lighting, a light food menu that is done well rather than just "done", a beautiful old piano, an outdoor patio that is cozy and welcoming and misters that spray while you sir under the shade of a beautiful tall tree overlooking a fountain across the way.    I was very impressed that they carried more dairy free milk options than just soy!  The wonderful man with the mustache even shared that they were careful about the almond milk they selected to ensure it would support the latte art they enjoy sharing with their customers. As a girl who LOVES both almond milk and latte art it made my day to know I could get both. (Typically almond milk doesn't hold the design as well.)   After sitting outside enjoying my coffee I decided to order a salad. I trusted the barista with her suggestion of the strawberry salad and was pleasantly surprised by the portion!  Typically salads from these types of places are small and leave me hungry. This came out massive and tasting amazing!    I recommend Altitude to anyone who is looking for an experience to go with a great cup of coffee.

The Wicked 6 is an outstanding display of what bar food has evolved into!  With unexpected ingredients and flavor that jumps out from almost every dish it makes for a "must stop" when in the North Scottsdale/Fountain Hills area.  Don't let the location at sunridge canyon golf course fool you this is not your average "golf club" dining spot. With a bit of a rock and roll vibe this is a great place to bring the whole family any night of the week. They offer everything from bonfires, beanbag toss, ping pong, to full indoor and outdoor seating.   The atmosphere and ambiance enhance the overall dining experience with breathtaking views of four peaks and lower fountain hills. The Friday night bagpipe player who comes up the 18th green of the golf course is an experience all in itself that is a must see.   Great food, great service, great spot!

OUTSTANDING!  Ike knows how to make the perfect sandwich!  He also knows how to provide an outstanding experience to customers.  We went right before catching a show not far from here at the Mesa Amphitheater.  A big thank you to fellow yelpers for being so honest about just how AWESOME the food is.  We happen to go during happy hour and were surprised to find they do chips and drink as the "happy hour."  Very clever idea.  The menu is extensive so anyone you bring will be happy because it's a sure bet they will find something they enjoy.  Even if it isn't posted up on the menu (like what I said I wanted) they are sure to have it, and have a fun name for it.  They were quick with taking our order but the staff was friendly and unlike other places you may stop to grab a quick sandwich you could tell they actually ENJOYED being there.  I can't say how much it changes the experience when you go to a place like this when the people working there make you feel like they actually are happy to be there.    The very best part was the advertisement for the happy hour had the coolest photo!  A funky feline helped sell the meal to us!  (See Photos)   Thank you Ike's for not only an exceptional meal but an awesome experience!

Good selection if you are looking for consignment clothing that is much more casual.  The store is very well organized, and the staff was very friendly.  Cute dressing room area.  Love it, sure why not, what was I thinking, and not for me hooks are extremely helpful!

Since moving from Minneapolis (over a year and a half ago) I have been searching for a fantastic coffee shop that also serves snacks. The coffee had to be amazing, the staff had to be friendly and the food had to blow me away.  Noci is my place!!  We had coffee, a waffle and a pesto and prosciutto panini. It was fantastic!  The waffle came out a beautiful golden brown and include a large helping of fresh fruit. But don't be alarmed it was the nasty stuff like cheap melon. It was fresh berries. The panini came with a massive helping of hearty fries. A perfect blend of euro meets american.   The best part of all was the coffee. We had iced coffee and the ice it was served over rivals sonics iconic ice!  The coffee was brewed to absolute perfection. Bold and flavorful.   The staff was so sweet. It was the owner and his wife who were in there and they took the best care of us. I can't wait to go back!

Ladies and gentlemen I introduce you to a new staple in uptown PHX!  Lou Malnatis will NOT disappoint. Classic Chicago style pizza. They do a crust called the buttercrust that is amazing. They manage to keep the bottom a lovely crisp and the rest of the pizza solid not too soggy.   The sausage has some of the most amazing seasoning!  My boyfriend wanted to bring some home to add to other recipes!    The owner even took the time to stop by. So sweet. All of the employees were so kind, attentive and quick!    Enjoy your visit to Lou's!
