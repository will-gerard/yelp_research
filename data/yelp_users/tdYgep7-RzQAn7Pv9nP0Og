GREAT tanning salon! a little pricey but totally worth it. The beds are super hot, and you are brown after like two sessions. Amazing staff, and in a neat convenient area.

Great ambiance. Went here with a friend. Really enjoyed the foie gras and cheese selections. I had the chicken with gnocchi- though this is a French inspired restaurant they have a nice mix of entrees and appetizers. Wine menu was decent.  Had a French martini. Definitely worth coming back to

flos is probably one of my favorite places for takeout. Its also very nice restaurant. They have a mixture of Chinese and thai food. They're teriyaki chicken is delicious.. and i love their egg rolls, they're so light. I been to some pretty pricey Chinese restaurants in the valley and wasted money,  Flo's is definitely worth every penny. if you want delicious fine Chinese/Thai cuisine, flo's is the place to be!

when i first moved here I thought this pizza place was the bomb but apparently I came on a good day. I have ordered pizza twice since my last post and have been disgusted. I asked the girl on the phone for a bbq chicken pizza, and she says they can make it. So when I came to pick up my order, the pizza literally had hot wings on top... HOT WINGS!  i have never seen a bbq CHICKEN pizza with hot wings on top, however despite the disapointment in my pizza and the rude service, I figured I'd "try" it. I was repulsed, tossed the pizza and called papa johns. NEVER AGAIN.

Was not impressed by their limited flavors, tobacco was to hoarse, made everyone cough. Needs to be decorated, very plain, but nice staff

this place has to be the biggest ripoff every. I had a man give me and my sister a full set and was talking trash about his co-workers. A regular walked in to schedule an apt, the minute she left he began to talk trash about her too! He was very unprofessional, was a bit rough with my hands. The corners of my fingernails were bleeding. He asked what i been getting charged for my nails and added $20 extra. Total rip-off in a horrible area. save yourself and go somewhere else!

Ive always seen Cocomo Joes on my way to work, and my in-laws wanted to try this place out the other night. We arrived on a friday night around 5:30 to still make happy hour.. Walking up to the door, the two tiki men in the front of the restaurant and the tacky blue door should have been a sign to walk out of this place.. The dining room was too dark, I had to use my iphone to read the menu.. The food was gland and not a bit pricey for below average quality food.. our waitress was very nice, however did not clear our plates up at all which left us no room. We were going to sit and talk a little more and get another round of drinks however, decided to wait.  Sadly, Will not be returning.

This chinese restaraunt was overly priced, had horrible service, overall bad experience. I would recommend going to PF Changs or Pei Wei for the money.

I came here w/ my girlfriend and my sister and had a few drinks, though we barely missed happy hour we had a great time. Definately try the bikini tini if you like martinis. I wouldn't recommend the bbq chicken pizza unless you like very strong bbq sauce. The calamari is good, very wide selection of beers. Is a little pricey but definately a great hangout.

even though this place is conveniently close for me, it waws a huge disspointment.. I was getting a full set put on for the my girlfriends bar hopping birthday extravaganza and i never really have had somebody make my fingers bleed until I went there... the lady was so rough on the edges of my nails the skin was bleeding! omg.. the lady was nice, the full set was a little pricey compared to other places.. definately not worth $35 to have bloody fingers. take your money elsewhere.

so today i had my first pure sushi lunch, i was right by there on my lunch break & ordered two california rolls to go.. The place looked very modern, very nice.. the staff was super nice, and the whole place gave me a good vibe. My california rolls were delicious. this place is somewhere i will definately keep going to.

My boyfriend took me to Roka Akor for my birthday this year, and I have never been there before. I love it! i liked how the restaurant was decorated, all the staff was very nice and approachable, and have some of the freshest sashimi! The first time I came here, they brought us the sushi of the day, and with fresh sea salt which they freshly scraped off this huge rock, that was very cool. everything was cooked right. i got the lamb cutlets, the meat fell perfectly off the bone. was delicious. the service was outstanding. I have no complaints.  now they have happy hour from 5-close we always stop and grab some saki or even a saki-sangria or two :)

the funny thing is i actually used my yelp app on my iphone to find a pool hall nearby, and this was the first one to come up. Despite the poor reviews on this place, i decided to give it a try.. gosh should i have not. lol. I went with a few friends and the minute we walked in the door, everyone turned around to look at us like we were invading their turf, what a horrible feeling! after about being there for an hour and waiting 20 minutes for two drinks, our bartender runs off to talk to her friends before giving me my credit card back.. she was also very rude and didnt have any pineapple juice, or certain things to make drinks, nor did she care either.. The staff is very rude there, the bathrooms are disgusting, there is graffitti all over the stalls.. If you are not a regular there, you are not welcome, basically..  I will not be coming back here, ever.  you have been warned lol.

This hookah lounge just opened in February and they're doing an awesome job. Definately a better hookah lounge in the valley! Have a wide variety of flavors, and the X-Hale guys in black are always walking around checking your coals. They play a huge variety of music, earlier in the evening they play middle eastern music and hip hop. Later on in the evening they play more hip hop, the lights go out and strobe lights come on. On certain weekends they have DJ's and dancing. Though they done serve alcohol, definately a good change in hookah bars:)

This place is just around the corner from work-- it has been recently redecorated. It looks very nice now. Prices are pretty good, but I come here because Linda does an outstanding job on my pedicure!  You can find me here every two weeks!

I come here for happy hour few times a month-- not bad drink menu and appetizers. Have interesting pizzas to choose. Wine per glass may be a little more expensive (though there is a wine bar in the same complex in Frys that has some great wines as well). I like to sit at the bar. The bartenders are very knowledgable on drinks and mixology :) love the drunk  monkey bread!

I feel like every place gets a 2nd chance.. With that said I've been here two times now and still disappointed.  Im in the middle of a lifestyle change and eating healthy is very important to me when choosing a restaurant.  They advertised gluten free pastas which immediately caught my attention. I ordered their basic fettuccine gluten free pasta with the house sauce. They brought us tap water which tasted horrible, and took 35 minutes to bring two dishes undercooked gluten free pasta.. I could literally take a bite into the pasta and it was Hard to chew.. We politely tell our waitress who takes It back to the kitchen and wait another 35 minutes for literally slightly cooked pasta (though it was chewable this time).   I was really disappointed, I was looking forward to this place opening up.
