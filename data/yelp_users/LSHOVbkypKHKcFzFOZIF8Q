Let me tell you about my experience with Dr. Donald Sheridan and his office. The backstory is that I already had carpel tunnel surgery scheduled with another surgeon, and I had a bad feeling about the other surgeon, not at all at peace. I kept telling myself to get over it, but it just didn't feel right, so I started from square one looking for a new surgeon. I was referred to Dr. Sheridan from the orthopedic surgeon who had done my knee surgeries. I called Dr. Sheridan's office, explained to the front desk lady my situation (that I had the other surgery scheduled within the week), and she was able to get me in for a consultation later that same week!   I will say I had to wait quite a while in the waiting room, but it was worth the wait. I knew from the moment I met Dr. Sheridan that I liked him - great personality, straightforward information, but thorough in his information at the same time, putting me at ease about my carpal tunnel surgery. Then I met Lauren, the surgery scheduler, who was awesome as well! She somehow managed to be professional and at the same time I felt so comfortable with her that she could have been my BFF. At my consultation, they were able to schedule my surgery for the very following week.   The day of the surgery, Dr. Sheridan checked in with me to see if I had any questions at all before we began the procedure, and answered any questions I had. The surgery went smoothly, and I'm currently 7 days post surgery, and haven't had numbness/tingling/pain in my right hand since the surgery. Dr. Sheridan, my right hand thanks you!

I consider myself a total fro-yo connoisseur- I have tried every self-serve yogurt place in town!  And Yogurt Builderz is my absolute favorite!!  Biggest reason- their Only 8 Flavors- ONLY 8 CALORIES PER OUNCE!  You can not beat that- and get this- they are phenomenal tasting!!!  It's like magic, I'm telling you! ALL their flavors are just wonderful!  Plus fantastic toppings- everything from brownies, to nuts, to fruit, to candy bars, to sauces.  AND one of the cheaper places per ounce in Scottsdale (not the cheapest, but on the cheaper side for sure). This place has it all!  And a friendly staff, adorable interior, nice atmosphere.  Only problem- I always want to go back for seconds because it's so delicious!  Of course at only 8 cals an ounce, I can afford to- LOVE THIS PLACE!!  Did I already say that though?

We'll start with the positives: lovely atmosphere, cute little place and nice patio on a beautiful Arizona Spring day. And I was happy they could seat us right away, on a busy Sunday morning. The staff was friendly enough, and pretty prompt (until the end of the meal, when we kinda got forgotten). But... The food you get for the price you pay is ridiculous. I got a side of fruit for $5 thinking that would be a decent amount of fruit, given the price. It was the TINIEST "bowl" of fruit I've ever seen at a restaurant. The prices in general were quite high for a breakfast place, even for scottsdale! Then my husband got a burrito, which was quite bland, and was sitting in a lake of a watery liquid of some sort (it was NOT like a sauce it was supposed to be in or anything- it was supposed to be a dry burrito), therefore making the tortilla all soggy. My husband's theory is the burrito was frozen and they microwaved it on the plate, causing the frost to turn to this liquid all over the plate. A little unappetizing, to say the least. Well, we can say we tried a new place... And will not be back :(

Okay so this is a seriously fun, seriously kick-butt workout! I discovered barre workouts about a year ago, and immediately became addicted. I have now tried all the studios in the area, and consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur by this point ;) Re-Barre is top-notch, with amazing instructors, super friendly staff, and awesome classes that will give you the results you want, if you stick with it! I have that delicious all-over soreness each time I do a class here :D Gotta love that!!

The Neighborhood Treatery has the most fresh-tasting, most awesomest (not a word) yogurt in Scottsdale! Bomb smoothies, too, if that's more your thing. I'm there at least twice a week, and it never disappoints. There's something different about the yogurt there that makes it much tastier, and never icy. Super cute place, too, with tic-tac-toe and checkers on the tables-- in case the person you're with is boring you to death :) Only complaints - they don't let you get your own samples, but always seem hesitant to get you any, either! Also, I wish they would carry a coconut milk based "yogurt", as so many people are sensitive to milk/lactose!

My husband and I went here for dinner, looking forward to trying a new sushi place. The main thing I left with is how SLOW the service was (or more likely how long the kitchen/sushi chefs took to make the food). Literally all we ordered was a chicken skewer appetizer and two single orders of sushi, and the restaurant was not at all busy, so I have no idea why it took so long. It was also awkward how they brought out one order of sushi long before the other (my husband was nearly finished eating his by the time mine came out). The other biggest negative was the cost for the food. Veggie rolls (6 small pieces) are $7. And three TINY chicken skewers are $7 too. The food was decent (I'd say a 6-7 out of 10), but not worth the wait or the cost. One more thing to mention is they sat us right next to a table with a family with two small children who were very loud and obnoxious the entire meal. The kids being loud isn't the restaurant's fault, but as I had mentioned, it was quite empty in there, and an experienced staff would know to look for a quieter area of the restaurant without small children in which to seat a young couple clearly looking for a more "date night" feel.

I don't know why there would be a single negative review of this place! It was awesome! I was hesitant because of the ratings I saw on Yelp, but we were hungry for breakfast, and in the area, with not much else around. It. Was. Wonderful! The girls at the register were super friendly and helpful (and even had free samples of muffins and scones, and let me try both :). They happily answered all our questions, very knowledgeably. Then, because we had so many questions, the line started getting longer behind us (yes, we were THOSE people), and they immediately opened up another register when they saw this happening. The iced coffee was very good and they offer many syrup flavors - both regular and sugar-free - to make it even yummier. Now onto the food. I ordered the Greek omelette... SO GOOD!!! Even the toast on the side was perfectly toasted and lightly buttered (although I do wish they had told me it had butter on it, or just put the butter on the side). My husband got a croissant breakfast sandwich, which I tasted, and it was good as well... And the cinnamon roll... OMG. Get it heated. So dang delicious! Unfortunately, we don't live close to there, otherwise we would have definitely been back! Highly recommend!

Holy moly this place is amazing!!! Needing dinner and happened to find this place on Yelp... So. Glad. I. Did! My husband got the steak burrito and said it was one of the best burritos he's ever had (he LOVES Chipotle, and he said he liked it better than that, so that was saying a lot); he actually said he wanted to open one of these so he could eat there all the time :P Now onto MY glorious meal (I didn't even try his because he got spicy stuff on it and I don't mess around with that). I've recently been on an "I'm not eating meat" kick, so eating out has been a challenge. I got one of their tacos called "The Triple T" (which I mistakenly called "The Triplet" when I ordered, because I failed to see the space between words :P). It had blackened tofu (don't knock it; it was phenomenal!) mixed with corn salsa, pico, and avocado, with cotija cheese all on a corn tortilla. Every single bite I couldn't believe how amazing the flavor was!! Highly, highly recommend this place!!
