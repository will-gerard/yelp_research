Everything tasted fine, it was just "off".  The sweet and sour pork wasn't like anything I've had - the sauce was similar to orange or sesame sauces at other places.  Also, I'm pretty sure it was chicken, not pork.  The sesame chicken is tangy/sweet but again, not like the standard sesame I've had other places.  The egg rolls had good flavor but VERY greasy.  The crab puffs are good, filled with crab & onion with just a touch of cream cheese; not overpowered like others elsewhere.  The chow mein is good, a bit salty.  Although nothing was gross, we won't likely go again.  It was absolutely fresh, however, cooked to order!

I have been getting tattooed by Rob @ Urban Art since 2009.  The shop is always clean, the people are friendly without the b.s. or pretentiousness you might find among other trendy shops.  This is the real deal.  There are several artists offering a variety of styles to suit your needs.  I've only been tattooed by Rob but I've seen the work of others & it doesn't disappoint.  I've been pierced by Jes & OJ - both are awesome as well.  Samantha, the shop manager, knows my name & exactly who I am every time I call.  Check it out, this is your new tattoo shop.  Sage has even donated to a charity Jeep run I help organize annually.  These are great people!  Remember, good tattoos aren't cheap & cheap tattoos aren't good.  You get what you pay for people.

A little pricey but definitely worth it! Everything is really fresh & their "designer" rolls are all tasty (what I've had so far).  The first time we went for lunch & it was just the 3 of us. The staff was really friendly & fun - they even encouraged us to "bomb" our saki bombers!  The place is very clean, even the bathrooms.  We've officially added this to our list of lunch spots to frequent!

Tasty fare at this mom & pop greasy spoon (literally, she serves, he cooks).  The service could be better (hence 4 stars) but it has a great family feel - think "Cheers".  The regulars frequent it daily for breakfast.  This place has the best biscuits & gravy!  They have several breakfast specials and very reasonable prices.  Love this place! I have not yet tried it for lunch or dinner.  They do have a bar & feature karaoke some nights, too!

I'm sad to say the place closed.  And to the reviewer that said the waitress is "on drugs"... Kandy has a disability.  Way to be a jerk!

I LOVE this office!  We always see Dr. Steve & each time we walk in we're greeted with a recognizing smile - they know us & that's always so nice.  My son had his first dental appointment here & he loves them as well.  They award the kids tokens to use for prizes out of the "quarter machines' (think of the grocery store).  I have been a patient there since 2007 & will never change dentists again!

Delicious!  We had wings - hot & sweet chili, the sampler which consists of poppers (cheddar), mushrooms, zucchini, mozzarella sticks, and onion rings as well as a cheesesteak.  Everything was amazing!  They beer batter the fried foods and everything tastes fresh, not frozen.  The prices are pretty good but I think the sampler is a tad pricey.  This is absolutely a locally owned place (which makes it better); they're closing down all next week to attend Country Thunder, lol. We will DEFINITELY be back!

I'm a fan of supporting local businesses so I've been eyeing this place since it opened.  We decided to try it tonight for dinner & we were not disappointed.  The ambiance is a bit lacking but the food & friendly service more than compensate for that!  We ordered 2 of the "sampler" meals: one had all the different meats & came with cornbread.  We added a side of coleslaw.  All of the meats were super tender & juicy, not too saucy.  The coleslaw is made mayo free & is not your typical slaw.  I wasn't a fan but my boyfriend loved it!  It has kale, broccoli, cabbage, etc.  The owner brought us samples of most of the sides to let us try before choosing.  The southwest creamed corn was one of my favs but I opted for the bbq beans & macaroni with my meal.  My platter was 2 ribs, 2 meats, 2 sides.  Both came with cornbread (with a twist).  It looks like the bread is baked into a loaf then sliced & grilled - so tasty! My son ordered the rib kids meal with fries.  All kids meals are served with an organic all natural juice pouch.  The prices are in line with your typical bbq joint but I'm most impressed that the food is homemade.    We had a chance to chat with the owner & he shared a bit of his vision with us.  He said he's trying to create something unique in the area to break up the monotony of burgers, Mexican, and pizza available while keeping in mind food allergies that have become more & more common.  The rubs/spices are MSG free & the sauce is made with brown sugar, no corn syrup or colorings.  Overall we really enjoyed this place & will definitely be back!  You won't be disappointed.
