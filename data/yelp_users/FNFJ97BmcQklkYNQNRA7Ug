I'm never in this neighborhood, but I was seeing a friend's band play at Joe's Grotto across the street and went in here for dinner. We had the Popeye on a thin, whole wheat crust and it may have been the best pizza I've ever had. THe ingredients were fresh, the crust was crispy, and there were no puddles of orange cheese grease on top. I just had my leftover slice for breakfast and it was just as good the next day. If I'm ever in the neighborhood again I will definitely come back.

I can only vouch for the chicken salad, as it's the only thing I've ever tried in the 20 years I've been coming here. It's THAT good. I always think about trying something else, but why mess with perfection?  Walking inside gives you the sense that you've stepped into a time machine and arrived in the late 70's. I, personally, find it to be awesome. Most of Scottsdale is lacking in historic flare. And yes, the late 70s is historic by Scottsdale standards. Besides, whatever money they're not spending on updating the decor is clearly going right into their magically delicious chicken salad.

Stopped by at 12:30pm on a Thursday and they were closed. No sign, no explanation. Was very disappointed because I've heard so many good things about this place.

Very friendly family-run business. I always stick with the simple mani-pedi and they do a great job. They seem to get a good deal of business but I've never had to make an appointment or wait more than 5 minutes.

I've had three pairs of pants hemmed here. It always takes about 7-8 days, but they do a good job and it's only $10. It's a small price to pay to have pants that fit.

UPDATE: One of the hems fell out of my pants after a few weeks, so I brought them back to be fixed. Not only did they do it for free, but they did it in about 5 minutes while I waited. That's some awesome customer service.

I recently leased my first new car in 12 years. The dealership told me to have my first service performed at 5,000 miles, so I stopped in here to get it done. The mechanic took a look at it, came back 5 minutes later, and asked me if I was aware that my car didn't need its first service until 7,500 miles. I was not aware! He still checked my fluid levels for free, sent me on my way, and told me to come back after another 2500 miles. I definitely will.

Very good for what it is- cheap, tasty bar food. Everything on the menu is fried and/or covered in cheese. I like to wash it down with a $5 pitcher of Blue Moon during happy hour, kick back, and wait for the inevtiable stomach cramps to arrive. It's a good pain.

Also bought the Groupon and I loved the place. It's every bit as good as Butterfields, but without the noise and the 45 minute wait. I got an oven-baked peach pancake and it was amazing. My only criticism is that they only give you those little preservative creamer thimbles instead of fresh half and half. Everything else is awesome though. My boyfriend and I thought it was so good we went back again and will definitely keep coming back.

Ended up spending $40 on a margarita, three beers, and one entree during happy hour. (I still tipped, the waiter was friendly and it's not his fault everything but the Corona tasted like a sweaty butt crack).  The dark bock microbrew tastes like bitter, cheap sake and smelled like margarita mix. The regular margaritas taste like corn syrup and wetnaps. The food was average and way overpriced. The red sauce tastes like spicy, water potting soil. I ate some of my sister's food as I didn't even order anything because they were charging $16 for a freaking chicken fajita. But the worst thing was the swarm of flies buzzing around our table on the newly-enclosed patio. I was swatting the air like a schizophrenic hobo.

The wait was long and my soup was cold. The cappuccino was alright. Everything on the "light" menu has eggs, so if you don't like eggs and don't want something with 80g of fat and sugar for breakfast, you're kind of screwed.

I used to take my dog to Banfield at Petsmart for several years, but I got tired of paying for a monthly plan that ultimately saved me very little money and being left to wait alone in a tiny room for an hour every time I came in.   So when my plan expired I decided to try this little place in my neighborhood. The staff is friendly and personable (they actually recognize me and remember my name when I come in), the prices are reasonable and, most importantly, I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes to be seen. I definitely recommend it.

I think y'all are missing the point: it's a DIVE BAR. It's supposed to be sleezy. The grafitti'd bathrooms are quite charming really, as long as you put paper on the seat and wash your hands, which you should be doing in ANY public bathroom. You know, just don't lick the stall door and you'll be ok. The parking lot is tiny but you can park on the side streets close-by. Premium draft beer is a pretty average price of $5/pint. There's a pool table and darts, but the best part is the awesome local bands that play here. And if you don't show up too late you can get a cozy booth with a good view of the stage.

This is my favorite restaurant. Not just for Ethiopian, but my overall favorite restaurant. Very affordable and just really delicious food.   I would eat here every week if it were close to my house. I'm very excited that they've started selling some of their dishes at Whole Foods now, particularly my favorites: misir wat, tikil gomen, and fosolia.

Really nice patio. It's surrounded by vines and has plenty of misters to keep you cool even when it's 115 out. Awesome food, better drinks, and one of the waiters made a special shot for me with Jack Daniels and Goldschlagger that tastes like Christmas.

This place is FULL of hipsters and I don't even care. I will take vegan food this good from dudes wearing scarves and man-purses. The first time I took my mom here she loudly discussed hunting deer and her desire to eat a plate of raw meat with bones and hair. My mom is kind of a dick. My point is, after she ate here once she's been pestering me to take her back for the last year. So if it's good enough for my mom, it should be good enough for you. Unless you think you're better than my mom. Well, there's a good chance you are. But my point stands.

YESSS. I am truly blessed to live across the street from the Pita Jungle. This is one of the few places in Scottsdale with a good selection of non-meats. I'm fairly sure they've imported the attractive hipster waitstaff from Tempe as they look adorably out of place in this neighborhood. My favorite dish is the One Thousand Beans hot pita and I do believe it has nearly ONE THOUSAND BEANS! For about $8 it feeds me for three meals.

I loved this place under the old ownership, but my sister and I came here last week and will not be returning.  Right before leaving the house we checked the website to make sure they still had the 2 for 1 deal. We got there and found out there was a new owner and the deal is now buy one, get one 1/2 off. We were disappointed because some of the rolls are ridiculously expensive. They have one that is $21. For $21 I expect the fish to perform tricks for me before being freshly slaughtered and lovingly placed on my plate. Anyhoo, when we let the owner (or manager, I'm not really sure who he was) know that their website was still advertising the 2 for 1 deal, he argued with us that we were wrong, then proceeded to pull out his smartphone and bring up the website to prove it!  When we showed him exactly where on the website the advertisement was, and that we weren't a couple of lying hooligans trying to scam some free sushi, he still refused to honor the deal. All of this in spite of the fact that, on a Saturday night, there were 4 people in the restaurant. So rather than employee some decent customer service and make $40 off of us in food and drinks, he let us walk out and made nothing.

Cozy, classy, casual and couches! Cheese and champagne! (Ok the last two are also Cs, but they didn't really fit the alliteration scheme.)  Uncorked really has everything I like. Great place to bring friends or a date. I can wear jeans and a t-shirt or a dress with heels and don't feel out of place either way.  I love the wine ($5 off glasses and flights on Monday? Yes, thank you!). And the cheese plates, while seemingly pricey at $17, are loaded with enough tasty treats to feed two people as a meal.  Not only is it not snobby, but it's not a hassle like many places in Scottsdale are. It's tucked away in the back of a shopping complex. There is plenty of parking and even when the place is full it's not loud and crowded.  I've been coming here since the grand opening and will continue to as long as they keep the wine flowing and the cheese... doing whatever cheese does. Great place to relax, hang out, and get your food and drink on.

If I ever have enough disposal income that I feel the desire to spend $5 on a 6oz container of raspberries, I know that Whole Foods can help me achieve that goal. In the meantime I'll continue to shop at Trader Joe's.

My sister's boss rented a private karaoke room here last week for a team-building exercise that I tagged along for. The room was fairly large and fit 20 people comfortably. I think the price was $300 for 2 hours and included a small plate of appetizers and a sushi platter.  Everyone had a blast. The food was pretty good. The drinks were a bit pricey at around $10 for a martini, but that's pretty average for Old Town. The karaoke selection was pretty big and the sound system was good. There's also a stripper pole in the room, so everyone can place bets on how many drinks it will take before the men start practicing their moves. The average for our party was 2.5.

If I believed in a god or heavenly afterlife, it would be embodied by Cookiez. The cookies are thin, soft, and can be draped over your finger like a Dali clock. The party in my mouth that is their homemade ice cream cookie sandwich is indeed surreal.

Very tasty. A bit pricey for the portion sizes, which isn't unusual for this neighborhood, but it is for a little casual placer like this. However, it's the only vegan restaurant on this side of town so it's worth it if you're craving a fresh, non-meaty treat.

I stopped going after a few months because I'm more into yoga than dance, so I switched to Zenergy where Alicia also teaches. But if you're into dance, this is a great place to go and most likely the most affordable in the entire Valley. Plus they have student discounts, which make it an even better deal.

Of the dozens of trendy yogurt shops that have popped up in Scottsdale and Tempe over the last year or so, I think Mojo has the best chance of staying in business. Lots of flavors and toppings, plus I like the punch-card where you can get one free after buying 10.

Robbie Fox is amazing. I'd like to have an affair with him. The first time I came here he personally did an Irish jig for my table, complete with a traditional Irish Christmas carol entitled "Merry F*cking Christmas". I was surprised that a place that looks so classy has shots of Jameson for $5. Haven't tried the food yet, but the menu looks great and I'll definitely be back. One caveat is that I recommend coming before 10pm, as that's when the good music gets turned off and the DJ and ASU d-bags arrive. *oonts oonts oonts* "Hey brah!"

It's rarely not happy hour here. The prices and food are great. I just worry it won't be in business long because the place always seems empty. I like it much better than Ra. Less trendy and less full of douche-b's.

I saw an online special for a $40 tune-up and decided my 8-year-old a/c unit could use it. They scheduled an appointment for the next day via email, which is great if you're like me and not a phone person. They did my tune up and recommended adding a pound of freon, which I took their advice on. They were done in 20 minutes and I was very pleased that they didn't try to sell me any other services or repairs, knowing that my unit was nearly a decade old and had never been serviced before. I will definitely call them again if I need maintenance.

This location has been here for at least 20 years and the reason it's stayed in business long enough to see dozens of trendy yogurt joints come and go is because it's DELICIOUS. Their Golden Vanilla kicks the ass of any frozen yogurt I've ever had, and I've had a lot of yogurt.

I am extremely pleased by the customer service at this store. I recently brought in my prescription from America's Best and ordered a pair of sunglasses since Lenscrafters has a much better selection of frames.  When I finally picked them up, I tried wearing them for a few days and didn't like them. The frame was too big and due to the thickness of my lenses, rubbed up against my face. My vision was bothering me too and I couldn't quite figure out why. One day I was looking at a street sign and switched from my old glasses to my sunglasses and realized suddenly that the prescription in the left lens was much weaker. It turned out that the optometrist at America's Best had actually written the wrong number on my most recent exam.  Lenscrafters was understanding and let me go get a new exam and pick out new frames even though my 30 day exchange period had just passed.  I have a very high prescription so it was tricky finding exactly what I needed without the glasses looking or feeling awkward. Stephanie, Betsy, and Eddie were all very helpful with giving me information and helping me select the right frames and lens package.  I would definitely recommend Lenscrafters over discount stores like America's Best. They cost a little more, but prices are still reasonable, they usually have some kind of sale going on, and you'll be happier with your investment if your glasses are perfect.

Great food, great happy hour prices. Every sushi item is half price from 3-5 and 8-10. Plus appetizers are $1 with the purchase of a beer. Not much in the way of ambiance, but not at all shabby. And you really can't complain considering how inexpensive it is. My boyfriend and I stuffed our faces and had 4 rolls, two appetizers, two large beers, and a large sake for about $40.

If this place had wi-fi I would gladly bring a laptop and camp out here all day while grazing on delicious food and bottomless mimosas. But they would probably frown upon that. Seeing as how this place opened up accross the street from my house recently, I'll have to settle for frequent visits and slowly getting fat over time.

I bought my boyfriend a Living Social coupon for a shave and he came home looking like his face got into a fight with a feral cat. It was truly alarming. I have never seen worse razor burn in my life. His face was covered in scabs for two weeks.  I don't know if that particular barber was dipping into the stores but perhaps booze and sharp objects is just a bad idea.

I'm so glad this place has been able to stay in business. I always worry about small stores that open in Scottsdale because most of them close very quickly. This place has so many different flavors of popcorn. I've tried maybe a dozen and have liked every single one. My favorite though is the salted caramel. If I get too big a bag I will eat it until I feel sick.

I was finally able to use my Groupon after they re-opened and I was very pleased. Me had the mattar paneer, malai kofta, and some potato dosa. Some of the best Indian food I've had in the valley.  Regarding the service: maybe they took a queue from the reviews on here because it was almost TOO good. Dude was kind of hovering over our table and refilling our water every 10 minutes.  In any case, I'm definitely going back soon to try their lunch buffet.

I've been coming here for 2 years and never had problems until recently. I've bought 3 batteries from here in as many months. Every one stopped working in less than a month.   I went to exchange the most recent one today and was blown away by how incredibly rude the employee was. He was defensive, condescending, implied several times that I was lying and sarcastically shouted "Happy holidays" at me when I turned to leave.   I will never come back again and recommend the same to anyone who doesn't appreciate being spoken to like a piece of trash for trying to exchange a defective product.

I brought my chihuahua puppy here today for a wash and day care. I was nervous about leaving my little buddy all day but I thought I'd give it a try so he can learn some social skills.  Lori and her husband were so nice!  I called around noon to make sure he was doing ok and they told me that I could watch him on their live webcam. I got to watch him run around and make new friends while I was at work. When I picked him up this evening he was happy and smelled fresh and clean. They even sent him home with a cute little box of treats and a coupon for $5 off my next visit. My little bro had a blast and their prices are so good,  I will definitely be bringing him back for another play day.

I'm not sure what to think about this place. The first time I ordered, I got a french dip and it was pretty good. But today I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and it was pretty bad. It tasted a bit soil-y, like the lettuce was unwashed. The bread was dry and stale and the whole sandwich crumbled apart. My coworkers got wraps and seemed to like them, but I probably won't order from here again.

The food was just really bad. The onion rings might have been good if the breading weren't cold and mushy. The "Grilled" hot dog had the taste and texture of boiled wiener. It was actually cold in the center. The buns were room temperature. This place makes me miss Indulge Burger even more. I would never eat here again.
