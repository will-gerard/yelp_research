My girlfriend and I love trying  new resturants and we usulaly check yelp as a resource. We visited the resturant about a month ago and we really enjoyed how friendly the staff and owners were. They were attentive and the food was mostly really good. The Chicken Scarpara was our favorite. We tried the handmade Ravioli and it was also good but the Chicken Scarpara was excellent it was not a dish either of us has had before and we love spicy and it had a kick to it. In fact I am planning on meeting another firend there tomorrow night and taking my husband this time too. Nice to see a local resturant that greets and meets their customers. As a Persoanl Chef myself I believe ti makes all the difference the presentation and the feeling of the resturant and of course the quality of the food.

We decided to try out Fago de Chao today for our Anniversary it was disappointing to say the least. I am also a Private Chef and they were gracious enough to let me tour the kitchen but the meat  was over done and dry. The salad bar was really good with lots of variety. One of the  servers was exceptionally nice he's the one that gave me the tour and brought us an Anniversary dessert that was very good. I would just expect that since the main excitement of the Resturant was all the meat that it should be cooked exceptionally well, juicy and moist.We visit a lot of restaurants for the cuisine and the atmosphere and this one unfortunately won't be on our list for a return visit at these prices especially.

I tried to make reservations for Mother's Day a week in advance and the person who answered the phone said they weren't taken reservations. We were going to be a party of 6-8 with my elderly parents and I figured it would be better to have reservations since I had family from out of town and I knew they had limited seating for handi-capped since I have been to the Resturant twice and liked the food. We're told they did take reservations when we got there way before the rush but they could not accommodate us since all the seating that was available was high tops obviously not good for elderly people to jump on to. They were not curtious about it at all. Maybe the staff should be better informed and also learn better manners.

I had the grilled watermelon salad not bad but disappointed with the name only 3 or 4 small pieces of watermelon to be found. Had good flavors though. I had the head on BBQ shrimp. Wasn't exactly expecting to have to remove all the shell to eat, also a bit surprised with the flavors. Tasted fine but expected a lighter sauce without body shells in-tacked and more BBQ flavor. We had the beignets for dessert they were excellent.
