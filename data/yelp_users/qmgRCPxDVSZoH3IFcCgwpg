Ok I know there are probably upwards a thousand 'bertos restaurants in the Valley, but Hilbertos is one of the best I've been to.   It's really close to where I work so I go there almost every morning as my morning ritual for breakfast. The ham, egg, and cheese breakfast burrito is simple, but amazing all at the same time. It blows McDonald's and Burger King's burritos out of the water! I usually get the green sauce to go with it. The red sauce is good too, but I like green better.   The service there is quick and to the point so you can get in and get out really quick.   The building used to be a Taco Bell so there is plenty of seating. I'm usually on the go so I don't eat there.   Very good restaurant!

I've been past this restaurant many times, but never went in. I also have heard a lot of good things about the place. I finally went in about a week ago because a friend had given me a coupon for 6 free wings. The atmosphere is very stereotypical of a BBQ restaurant. Lots of reclaimed barn wood and old signs. We got carryout so I didn't stay in the actual restaurant very long. The service I did receive was very good though. The food and prices, on the other hand, were a different story all together. We'll start with the food. The macaroni and cheese was top notch. My fiance also said the potato salad was great. The green beans needed something extra to boost their flavor. The baby back ribs were nothing special. The most concerning was the wings. Lets just say I'm glad they were free because they were not good at all. We ordered the medium buffalo flavored wings and they had very little sauce on them. The lack of sauce made the wings taste like they had been boiled and unflavored boiled chicken is not good. I half finished two and threw rest away.  The food quality and food prices definitely did not match. For the price I paid for just the half rack of ribs, I could go to Texas Roadhouse and pay a few dollars more for excellent ribs. All in all it was pretty inconsistent experience.

I love breakfast. It's the best meal of the day. With that said, The Place are the masters of breakfast!  The best way to describe this restaurant is your run of the mill mom and pop establishment...ON STEROIDS!  Since they moved down the street to a larger location, I have been there on several occasions and I'm never disappointed. Recently I ordered the hungry man special. This meal comes with 3 eggs, a huge order of hash browns, 3 strips of bacon, and 3 HUGE biscuits with gravy.  Everything tasted awesome, but the bacon really stood out among the rest.  This isn't your normal bacon. It's more like a bacon steak. It's very thick cut and tastes like heaven.  If you don't try anything else there, try the bacon and you will be hooked for life.  The service here is among the best.  The wait staff is amazing.  They paid attention and kept my ginormous drink filled.  Food prices were very reasonable. My bill came out to about $12 for the meal I described above.  This is "The Place" to be!!!

This restaurant is one of Phoenix's best kept secrets behind the Church's Chicken. The service is topnotch, the food is amazing, and the drink selection is up there with the best of them.   I went there for the first time two days ago with my Mom. I got the recommendation from a couple of friends who share the same love of this kind of food that I do. I ordered the Afterburner Burger and it exceeded my expectations. It had just the right amount of heat. I also ordered fries and onion rings and they did not disappoint. My mom ordered the reuben and it looked pretty good.  The food prices are cheap which made the food taste even better.  Not only is the food good, but they have a huge selection of vintage soda that would blow your mind. They receive extra points for having the Texas born "Dublin Dr. Pepper" in stock.   The owner doesn't talk much but the service is amazing. The ambiance is a little dive-y but it adds to the experience.   All in all, Rocket burger is a great restaurant to chow down on your favorite foods.

First impressions go a long way most of the time and my first impression of this place is bad.  I'll start with seating. When my friends arrived with our party of seven, we waited a good 40 minutes to get a table. After what seemed like an eternity, they offered us a booth. The only problem was that we had a couple stockier guys in the group and a booth would be less than comfortable.  After another 40 minutes we were finally seated.  After we were seated, I noticed the only good thing that this establishment has going for them. Wall to wall TV's. That was not enough to keep me happy. I opened up the menu and saw the prices. This place was way overpriced for the quality of food they had. In other words, crappy food at an unbelievably high price.   Our waiter took our drink orders, which was efficiently done, but after that I would only see him two more times that night. He refilled our drinks once and brought our orders. After we were done and he took our stuff, we waited a half an hour for the check. Needless to say he did not get a great tip.  In summary, this restaurant is the exact opposite of what a good restaurant should be. Don't eat there!

I've never been to Chicago so I don't know what their food is like, but I imagine it's a lot like Joey's of Chicago.   The restaurant used to be a Fazoli's, but with their unfortunate downfall (I miss their bread sticks so much!), its only appropriate that another decent restaurant take its place.   When you walk into Joey's it's filled with memorabilia from Chicago, which is pretty cool. I really like the randomness of the different items on the wall. There is a lot of seating too.   I usually get the Hot Italian Beef sandwich with peppers and cheese sauce. I also get fries on the side. The sandwich is pretty good. I recommend getting au jus sauce on the side and not actually on the sandwich itself. It makes the sandwich too soggy when ordered that way. The fries are not nothing to write home about. They seemed undercooked to me.   The food seemed a little pricey to me. They do use Vienna Beef products so you might be paying for quality.  The service was pretty good. They took my order and brought my food to the table, which is awesome.

Ever since the Pop the Soda Shop in Scottsdale closed, I've been looking for a place to get my vintage soda fix. When I found out about Rocket Fizz I knew I had found a keeper.  When you walk into the store for the first time it can be a little overwhelming. There is literally wall to wall soda. Once you get your bearings, its an adventure trying to find sodas that you might like. I highly recommend anything made by Sprecher Brewery. I lived in Milwaukee and got hooked on their cream soda. When I moved back to Phoenix I was bummed when I couldn't find it. Rocket Fizz has it.  Not only do they have soda, but they have a huge selection of hard to find candy. Their salt water taffy stock is the biggest i've ever seen! They also have cool antique looking signs on the walls for sale, which adds to the great setting.  The service is awesome. The employees will help you find the best soda and alot of the time their recommendations are right on.  Great place! Go there ASAP!
