Had the lunch special of chicken tacos. Deep fried and oily. Salsa was good, as was the rice and beans. Don't think I will be coming back.

I've now been here twice.  Once for dinner and once for lunch.  I find the menu creative and seasonal.  The decor is tasteful.  We had two entrees only with a bottle of wine.  I had the evening special which was a Veal Scallopine with Horshradish Cream sauce.  My date had the mushroom stuffed ravioli with tomato cream sauce.  Both were flavorful and portions were appropriate.  We shared a bottle of Argentinean Pinot Noir.    Very highly recommend Caffe Boa.

We tried out a nearby Pizza place tonight, Began's Classic Italian Pizza. It's tucked away in a dying strip mall on Baseline, west of McClintock. You really would need to know it's there to find it.   I was expecting a strip mall kind of joint but was quite pleasantly surprised by the place. It's very nice, well decorated and perfect for a romantic dinner. They have an outside patio and seats at the bar in addition to ten or so tables inside.   We split the Mediterranean Mix appetizer which was Feta Cheese, a selection of olives and a basket of warm, soft and tasty bread. It was a nice starter that we followed with the Diavola Pizza. That was topped by homemade Italian sausage, pepperoni, crushed red peppers, jalapenos, fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce. Really good!  The pizzas are 12 inches so plenty for two. We actually only ate half of it and are saving the rest for breakfast. My friend enjoyed a nice glass of Chianti with her meal and they have a pretty good wine selection.  The service was friendly and efficient. Our server told us they've been open for seven years. I can see why they've managed to do so despite the location.  Total cost of our meal (I had water) was $31 which is a great value for the food quality, quantity and service.

Went to Tott's for the first time this week. Following other Yelp suggestions I ordered the Orange Chicken. Flavorful dish, but needed a bit more 'heat' (I guess I can always add that to my dish). Appetizer was the Lettuce Wraps. Nice cool lettuce with flavorful chicken filling.   One appetizer and one main course fed two easily and the bill was $18.    I'll go back to check out other dishes.

Great atmosphere.  Bruce, the owner is very hands on and makes you feel welcome.  Mike behind the bar reminds you of the TV show Cheers...Where everyone knows your name.  It's a cozy neighborhood place with a sports bar undertheme.    Food is always consistent and hot foods are served hot.  The restaurant is a clean and the bathrooms are too.

What a nice place to spend time with someone special, especially at night.  We ran around the park like teenagers watching the moving illiminated lights as they changed color.  We stood under the railroad bridge as a train passed overhead.  A great place for a first kiss!

What a great surprise stumbling across this bank!  Open 7 days a week with lobby service  I have banked with the Mega Uber Banks and have been nickeled and dimed (literally) with service fees.  I opened both a savings and checking account here.  Since my company does not offer direct deposit the associate told me I would have to have a traditional checking account with service fees.  I'm thinking - here we go again.  But it was one of those think on your feet moments.  Off they went (I'll assume to get approval).   They let me open up a type of checking account that only charges you for check printing - No other fees and pays interest.  In fact, if you use a non-MidFirst Bank ATM, they will refund you the service fees.  How refreshing with the current state of banking.

Poor service. Crowded and very loud. The server did not place my order and I never received my last order. Poor follow through.   The boneless wings I did get we're hot and tasty though.

What a great find close to my house  I just love the rustica pizza.  They even keep one half of the pizza in the oven to keep it warm as two normal sized people can't eat that much pizza. Plan on taking some home. @crust

Always a tasty treat. The special ground beef has a flavorful kick. The manager delivered my order. Colorful decor.

Visited during that shoulder time of the day between lunch and happy hour.  Seated outside on a wonderful sunny day. Immediately given chips and salsa. Nice thick, rich salsa and not pico  de gallo like some restaurants serve. Ordered a carne asada burrito enchilada style.  Very tasty and huge. Great layering of flavors. Black beans were just how I would make them, so it's a winner too. So why only four stars? The food could have been warmer when served. I'd come back

Came here for lunch. Was seated immediately. I ordered two tacos and a side of the coco rice. The steak taco was a little tough but not that tough. Nice flavor and served on white corn soft tortilla. I was really impressed by the green chili taco  lots of layered flavors.  I would order this one without hesitation. Although, I walked here, it appears that parking may be an issue when the next door neighboring restaurant re-opens.   All in all, a great new casual dining spot in Old Town.
