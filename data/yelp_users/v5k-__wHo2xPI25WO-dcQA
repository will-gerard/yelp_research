I am a sucker for antiques and historic anything - one night after a heavy boozing session in downtown Phoenix, I decided that rather than risking a DUI or calling a friend to babysit, that I would find the most affordable hotel that wasn't a shit hole. Hotel San Carlos had sweet rates, so this was the spot.   Before coming here I knew nothing about the history of it.. so I wasn't in it for the ghosts, although my wallet went missing, so could it be the spirit of Leone Jensen that was to blame? I will never know. I ended up getting the King Suite, for the same price as a regular room. Blame it on my abilities to get whatever the hell I want is up to you, but the guy at the front desk was more than happy to upgrade. Score.  Once inside the room, I was taken aback by the beautiful crown molding, Victorian decor, original radiators heating the room, vintage bed canopy and of course, the antiques that were scattered about. It reminded me of one of my old apartments in Boston, plenty of history to give me that sweet sweet feeling of being back in New England. This was what I dug most. I am not sure how big a normal room is, but the King Suite was pretty spacious. A loaded bar, with stools and all, living room area with a pull out couch, tv and footrests,  an armoir for hanging my clothes, which I didn't use obviously..  I snooped through every nook because it was all so old and interesting and mostly because im nosey. The bed was friggin' huge.. assuming they named the room after the bed would not be totally out of the question.   Here come the complaints... The pillows.. my god, they were so hard and gigantic (that's what she said). I ended up having to use a throw pillow from the couch to rest my head comfortably for I am a small human being with a tiny neck. The bathroom entrance has a step up that is about 10" high which I am surprised I did not stumble over and fall face first into the toilet followed by a broken nose and bleeding knees in the middle of the night. And lastly, had I of slept in 10 minutes more than I did, I would have been awoken by the sound of the maids vacuuming through the paper thin walls.. There is very little privacy in that sense.   Other than that, the staff were so nice, and it was decorated beautifully for the holiday season. I hear the pool is rad, and how can it not be when Marilyn Monroe herself took a dip in it once upon a time? Other celebs have shacked up here as well.. Mae West, Jack Dempsey, John F. Kennedy and one of my faves..  Clark Gable. How cool is that!   Come to think of it.. I did hear the sound of little children talking and laughing as I was leaving that morning, which I blamed on something outside not knowing the story about it being built on the first schoolhouse in Phx and over some sacred wishing well? Maybe I did experience a little paranormal activity, without even knowing it!  I will certainly be back!

Delicious!  B introduced me to this place because he eats here at least twice a week, and my god, I now understand why. They have the most delicious wraps I have ever tasted in my entire life!  Fresh delicious ingredients that are actually healthy for you.. and I love nothing more than healthy food that doesn't taste healthy at all.. for instance, the teriyaki 90210.. Grilled teriyaki chicken, crunchy veggies, fresh ginger slaw & jasmine rice.. amazing! Rocky VII, who doesn't love cheese-steak?? Not the healthiest choice they have to offer, but goddamn delicious. Ive also tried the Gringo Star which is the mexicany wrap and The Godfather with salami, ham and my favorite, provolone. I usually get the pasta salad to accompany my lunch, which is also, very yummy. Ive literally never tried anything here my mouth didn't instantly fall in love with.   Really, the only thing that sucks about this place is the parking lot.. its tiny! You're lucky if  you can even find a spot during the lunch rush, and if you do, you're lucky if you can get your vehicle out of there once you've parked. People create their own spots at this joint, sometimes behind your car.. but really, park across the street and walk if you have to, it is absolutely worth it!

G&D is one of those places that I just "end up" at.. its centralized between me and all my friends, and they have everything you could ever need .. so its wicked convenient. Trivia, Karaoke, TV's, Beer, Wings, Scotch Eggs, Pool tables, cigarette machines, children running around screaming.. you name it, they probably have it.   The first time I came here was for trivia night.. it was dramatic and everyone was cheating, but the loaded potato app. made everything all right in my world.  The second time I came here was after the Switch OYE, which I totally don't remember.. as Brad E.'s review noted, there was a game that involved me falling asleep sitting up and everyone screaming my name as loudly as possible to interrupt my slumber, or something.... There was also war paint and apparently I ran into some co-workers.. I didn't believe them until a photo surfaced. I will say no more.  The third time I came here was for Georgie S.' 8th 26th birthday celebration. We actually came here twice, once for after brunch boozing, and the second time to sing Karaoke, but mostly we just listened to Nathan S. serenade us for 3 hours.. football was on, many beers were consumed, the photos reflected a happy setting and im pretty sure the bday girl was pleased with her final celebration. At least, it was supposed to be the final. I'm pretty sure it wasn't.   The 5th time I came here was last night.. for football and beers. As always, I was content and happy, enjoying myself and the wedding reception debauchery (yes there was really a wedding reception here) that was going on..  I just generally enjoy this place, there is always parking, its right off the rail, the bathrooms are gross, but manageable, food is actually really good for bar-fare, especially the English selections.. Great beer selection, KILTLIFTER WHAAAAT, full bar, always an interesting crowd and everyone is always having a great time.   Totally come here. Me and my friends will probably be there too.

Lets face it, Phoenix does not have the most amazing music scene in the universe, and with that we get crappy music venues.. although out of the few we have to choose from, Rhythm Room might be my favorite.    Even though its kinda small, they have everything you could ask for in a music venue.. great sound system, decent bathrooms - yeah I said it, really cool bartenders and really great drink specials. I actually just saw a Tweet that called their specials "infamous".. either way, this place is the jam, literally.  Three complaints: 1. Its hot as balls inside. 2. The door girl has the personality of a napkin and is extremely unfriendly. 3. You cant take your drinks out to the closed off patio and unless its some zoning law or whatever, thats pretty lame..  Aside from that, im a fan! Now if only we could get more bands to stop out here.

I hate to be an asshole, but I hated this place.   I came here yesterday with a group of friends for lunch. Our 15 minute wait turned into what felt like an hour, when impatient me finally went in to see what the deal was... To my surprise, there was an empty table for a party of 7 that was just sitting there. Are you kidding me? So I ask one of the servers if its cool that we snag it, to which he said Yes. Just cram in tight. NO big deal. So I go and grab my friends to alert them that the table was ready, and when I walk back in, some stupid little bitchy server is standing there glaring at me telling me she "needs a minute to move the table" while huffing and puffing and sighing and just generally being a little queen about having to move a freakin table. I'm sorry, isn't it your JOB to accommodate patrons? I thanked her as she stormed off, and say something shitty to her about being such an inconvenience. I never saw her again throughout the duration of my visit.   Star removal #1.  We all sit down, and continue waiting for our drink order to be placed. Finally, after about 10 minutes, this happens, but were without menus, so no one *really* knows what they want, Waitress huffs, rolls her eyes, and goes to grab menus. We look, she takes our order, but only for about 6 of the 8 people at the table. She somehow forgot about the tallest man at the table and the girl sitting across from him. Once she comes back, after 3 attempts, she gets the order wrong, serves me my sake without a cup or a glass for my beer. Seriously?  Star removal #2.  We finally order. Mind you, this was the longest lunch in the universe, because at this point we had already been there for an hour. Luckily our waitress got the order correct, except a few of us ended up waiting at least 45 minutes for our rolls to come out.. specifically the Avocado rolls.. did you run to California to grow and pick them yourself because.. wow.   Star removal #3.  They managed to Eff up the most important part, which was the SUSHI. My unagi was not fresh, the spicy tuna tasted like plastic, they only had smoked salmon, no raw. They waitress *highly* recommended the dessert roll, which was ice cream rolled in rice krispys.. I know that sounds awesome and all, but im here for sushi, not ice cream. Also, on the menus, it says they have the choice to put a grat on ANY size party.. this to me is absolutely absurd.  Star Removal #4  I'm sorry, but when you see a PARTY OF EIGHT slide in, you do everything in your power to make these people happy, because if you don't, you can expect that "We can grat anyone we want" to be the only grat you get. Nothing additonal.  Get your shit together Moto, and maybe remind your waitstaff that their JOB is to make sure your patrons enjoy themselves, not make us feel like a burden. If it weren't for them, this review wouldn't have been so shitty.  P.S. Start to finish, lunch took 2.5 hours.   FAIL.

I have been to Compliments a few times over the years, mostly because anytime I would come into town to visit, my mother would take me to get pampered with massages and manicures, but also to see Janna, the hair guru of the year. I come from a family full of women who are very particular about their hair, myself included, so when the hair queen of the Fosters (my mom) recommended her, I had to go in to fix the mess that was created previously by the "hair artist" in Houston.   Janna is wonderful, she knows what she is doing and can certainly work a pair of shears. I would highly recommend her if you are looking for someone young and refreshing with good ideas. Their salon is more upscale, and they use Bumble & bumble and Epicuren products which are always great. The salon is super clean and everyone that works there is extremely friendly and helpful. They all have beverage service which is always a plus.  I've also had a massage by Beth who is AWESOME! Extremely profession and just a very good masseur. For nails, Debbie is great and definitely see Robyn for a facial. Their prices are typical for spa services, you can get a full listing of services an products on their website - www.complimentssalonandspa.com.

This place has the happiest Asians I have ever met in my entire life. You literally walk in the door and they all yell Hello and giggle for 3 minutes.. And who doesn't like to be greeted by smiley happy giggly Asians? I certainly dont mind.   Splendid Nails has been around for as long as my mom has lived in this neighborhood, which is at least 11 years since I've been coming here since my first prom. I believe any nail shop that can stay open that long is pretty impressive. The owner, by far, gives the best mani/pedi's .. and she is also one of the funniest people I have ever met in my life, but to be quite honest, I have never received bad service from any of the ladies that work here. Ive even gotten full sets here that lasted through football games and softball scrimmages, which is hard to find. They also give a great eyebrow wax too if this is what you are looking for.   The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because one time I was in there enjoying a deluxe pedi ($32) and the fattest grossest man in Arizona walked in looking to get his "toes cleaned up"... Every single person working in there literally sighed in disgust and clearly started talking shit in Korean.. not that I didn't find this mildly entertaining, I just thought it was kind of, rude, because you could tell dude knew what was going on. Disgusting clientele do exist, but its uncool to make them feel as such. IMO anyway.  Anyway, these guys are great, certainly give em a shot if you reside in the 85306.

I have called these guys twice now, and both times they never showed up. Thankfully the city girl in me is still alive and well, so my cab hailing skills are still 100%. Apparently with these guys its just best to avoid making a rez and hail one yourself.. IMO anyway.

I cannot even begin to explain the love I have and have had for this place since it opened. I used to live next door and it was always my Sunday breakfast spot. Now that I'm back home, it has become my 3 times a week breakfast spot - yes, I live on the west side and yes I am willing to drive 20 miles for their California burrito. I don't care about gas prices or photo radar.. all I care about is their burritos and green salsa... Its delicious, bursting with flavor, perfect tortillas and a whole lot of authentic Mexican love wrapped inside.  Not only this, but its CLEAN, which is rare for a joint like this and not only that, but the staff are NICE, and speak excellent English, which I dig because my Spanish absolutely blows.. They're always smiling and they even remember what you want.. All I have to do these days is walk in and my burrito is already being prepared. Before I even pay. What is better than that?  If you love potatoes, like myself.. try the California. If you like the usual carne asada.. theirs is excellent...  Actually, if you just enjoy Mexican food in general, eat here.. its real, good non greasy, tasty, orgasmic Mexican food and the Horchata is delish and their enchiladas are spectacular..  God, why must I live so far away??

Four Peaks Brewery never fails to bring back fond memories of many many things.. Old friends, early 20's, scandalous bathroom "breaks", the "patio of illegal behavior", exes, birthday celebrations, drunken debauchery, peeing my pants.... among many other things. It's always the same too, so for a place that brings pleasant reminiscent thoughts and consistency, who can complain? Great menu options, I'd say its your typical above average bar type cuisine, but none of it has ever been crap. I would be the first to list a list of crap if needed. On top of that they have Kiltlifer, so seriously, what is better? To put the whipped cream on top of all of these wonderful things, I swear the only other person in Phoenix who has ever lived in (or even visited) Cape Cod works here.. makes for good conversation about things Phoenicians could give a shit less about. Like sailboats, sea glass and lobstahs.   Perfection comes in all shapes and sizes, and luckily, Four Peaks is one of them for me. No complaints here, I have and always will love Four Peaks.

When I think of sports bars I envision pitchers of beer, hamburgers, more TV's than you can count, team memorabilia, life size cardboard cutouts of Shaquille O'Neil that scare the shit out of you when you turn the corner, shoddy service, janky menus, video games, tons of dudes and the token girl who pretends to be into sports.. Horse & Hound delivered and will provide you with all of the above. Two rooms of it even.. this joint is huge! They even have one of those claw games, but instead of being full of cheapy stuffed animals or 6 year old snickers bars, there were lobsters in it. Live lobsters that you can catch and have them cook.. no I did not do this.. I had nachos instead.  I am adding a star for the sheer fact that they had an area devoted to the Red Sox (Yes all you Yankee fans can unfriend me and kiss my ass), another star for the shuffleboard table. I freakin love shuffleboard with a passion.. wasn't sure why it was situated directly underneath the 17 big screens, perhaps for the attention whores out there? Whatever, bravo anyway.  This place is great for all you sports fans.. literally, every sport was playing on one of the 50 TV's and they will put your game of choice on the large flat screen front and center if you ask nicely, or tip well.. Either or.  P.S. Its also great for off-site betting ;o)

This review is for their Sunday Champagne Brunch only, and let me tell you what, it was the SHIT!  If you are ever in the mood for a wide array of seafood, sliced meats, omelets with whatever the hell you want on them, pastas, french toast & pancakes made to order, chocolate fondue, soups and all the fruit you can sink your teeth into, accompanied by complimentary champagne or mimosas, etc. etc. etc. then you should totally come here.   The location is pretty great, tucked away from the craziness that is Phoenix and the views are awesome if you're into the desert. The staff are SUPER attentive, it was almost annoying because I was having a conversation and I hate talking when they come over, I don't know why, but I just stop convo until they leave..... But hey, at least my mimosa flute was never less than half full. On top of all that, they have complimentary valet. Radical.   Id really really like to check out their pool in the near future because I hear its pretty fantastic. If anyone else is unemployed and bored out of their mind like myself, holler.. I'm excellent at pool crashing and day drinking.

Arrow Animal Hospital is not my favorite place in the universe, but Ive been visiting these guys since I was in high-school whenever I had an issue with one of my animals and have never been displeased. They have a clean facility and wonderful doctors. The day after Christmas, I woke up to a depressed lethargic dog, so I rushed her over to Arrow.   They diagnosed her with Parvo, which is a terrible terrible disease spread by other infected dogs and is virtually impossible to kill or cure. There are treatments however, to which the doctors promptly got started on. I was really nervous as I watched her give my puppy an IV drip along with 5 other injections, mostly because I was going to be sent home with all these things that I was going to have to administer myself twice a day. I asked about 200 questions and the Dr. was so nice and helpful and very informative. She gave me an after hours number to call if I felt uneasy or had anymore Q's as well.   The next day, she called me first thing in the morning to see how the pup (and myself) were doing.. And everyday after that, she called again, up until my dog got better. I really appreciated this. Not only that, but every single person working there genuinely cared about my dog, and it showed with how they treated her each time we went in for followups. I love all of them.  I'm happy to report that my dog is better, and im glad these guys are located right around the corner, just in case.

6 words.. Burn your face, Shit your pants.  If you like overly greasy pizza that falls apart with cheese slapping you in the chin while trying to take a bite, then having an immediate stomach ache afterward, this is your place.  Rays has been around for a while, but I remember it being a lot better when I was in High School.. Perhaps it was an off day, but It just, wasn't good. And the girl at the counter could not have been hating life more.   next.

This review should have been posted many many moons ago, for the wonderful Bob Simms, who was the artist and creator of my back piece, sadly passed away a few years ago and was unable to complete his work. He will be forever missed, and I am honored to have 22 hours of his artwork permanently etched into my skin. Still, I have a slight problem, unfinished work!!  I have searched high and low for someone to complete his work.. Among numerous denials because so and so artist wouldn't "be able to take credit" or "I'm going to charge you $200 and hour" or just plain ol' crap portfolios I've come across have led back here. Eager to see what had changed, and to retrieve a new nose stud since mine was lost along the way somewhere, I found myself back at square 1.  To my surprise, Bob's old girlfriend still works here.. Karyn. Let me tell you, this bitch is amazing. Not only is she full of immeasurable talent, but she is just so f-ing cool you cant help but love her. She remembered me immediately and we began to talk tattoos, and suddenly my dreams came true, she agreed to finish his work. She noted she has finished a lot of his pieces, which I find to be extremely strong of her. It has to be tough...   I killed 2 birds with one stone on my random stop in.. acquired a new stud and a new artist.. my first appointment with Karyn is in a few short weeks and I am so excited that after all my searching, the person who was closest to him is going to complete my art. Not to mention she is amazing.  I highly recommend Lucky Draw to anyone seeking quality work at reasonable prices in a very sterile environment. This shop has been around for a long time, for a good reason.   RIP Bob, you are sorely missed!

Lo-Lo's is rigoddamndiculous. If you don't like this place there is something absolutely wrong with you.  Came here for #smunch this past Saturday morning with some of Phoenix' finest ... and I am positive no one was disappointed.. I got the Betty Boop which consisted of a juicy breast of chicken and a large, butter soaked waffle with hints of cinnamon.. when I say butter soaked, I am not even exaggerating. Delicious! Being the fat kid that I am, I also ordered a side of smothered potatoes, ie: roasted taters drenched in their homemade gravy. FYES! FTW! I also got Kool-aid. In a mason jar. Why did I ever stop drinking the stuff? I don't know. Memories of childhood immediately flooded my mind along with a 5 hour long sugar high. I probably gained 5 pounds, but whatever.. This food takes you into instant Utopia, followed by an instant food coma. I think we had about 5 different servers as well, but how can you complain about that? They were on top of their game!  Do not come here if you are trying to eat healthy or have issues with cholesterol and/or get annoyed with really loud drunk/hungover people (depending on the time of day you come, sometimes they're open till 3am). Oh, and don't even worry about the location, safe no, sketch yes, worth it, absolutely.   AmazingaZING!

I dont even know why anyone likes this place. All their meats taste exactly the same, like nasty rubber salami.  And there was a fly in my soup.  Even their commercials fucking suck. Did they really think Spongemonkeys singing the most annoying song in the world would make people want to buy sandwiches...?  I'm all set with Quiznos. Thanks, but no thanks.

I came here with a group of Eliters after Thursdays OYE.. what better way to get to know a new group of people than through Karaoke? You find out whose shy, whose got shitty taste in music, whose heart is broken, whose the attention whore, and whose that fucking guy in the corner anyway?   We were all previously sauced up, so why stop now? You have to be saucy for Karaoke. Drinks all around. We were also all full.. so no one ate anything, so I have no idea what the food is like, but apparently its good shit.  All I can say is that there was a rockin' selection of tunes to choose from, an eclectic mix of people, adequate seating, full bar, and BONGOS. Fyes. I can assure you I made an ass out of myself, multiple times, but hey.. I had a damn good time doing it. Totally recommend this spot for you to do the same.

A 50% off 50% rack.. hell to the yeah and yes please!  Anytime I stumble upon a funky little boutique, I get really super excited and absolutely have to see whats happenin' inside. Luckily for Mandy's, everything in the display windows caught my eye and I wanted to purchase all of it. Lots of boho/urban hippie pieces just screaming "NIKKI, No one else in the universe will wear this long flowery embroidered dress, you need to save me from this horrid rack" .. so what do I do? I buy her. Along with all her rack mates that just happened to be on the sale rack I mentioned above. Fortunately, I have an eye for sales, and everything I absolutely couldn't live without, was in fact, on sale.. I blame this on the sheer fact that I wear weird shit, and no one else wants it, so that's just where the pieces I dig end up.. I am more than okay with this. Unique pieces for next to nothing, that's my style.   I ended up with 3 beautiful dresses, and splurged on the most adorable necklace in the universe - with a total that came out under a bill.. that's a pretty good stinkin' deal if you ask me.   Not only does this place have fantastic sale items, but they get new pieces in everyday, and all of them are unique in their own right. Some designer, some not.. Prices are standard for their higher end items, maybe a little cheaper. Great accessories and they have a woman who transforms regular Havaiana flip flops into sparkling works of art as well. I loved the whole style and vibe this place had, and the woman working there (sorry I don't remember her name) was more than happy to recommend items she thought would look best on me. Had she not told me there was enough blue in the pink dress I bought (since pink usually looks horrid on ginger kids), I wouldn't have gotten it.. but I did, and also received tons of compliments. Thanks Lady! I promise to come back again and again and again to trade in my hard earned dollars for your groovy little dresses.

This place is Fn amazing.   The boy took me here for my birthday dinner, and literally, I cannot think of any other place I would have rather been at. We went late, 9pm rez, It was an amazing evening so we sat outside near the fireplace. You seriously have to sit outside, it's almost like you're in another state on vacation with how secluded it is. Each table gets its own heat lamp too, by the way. We started with a bottle of Champagne and the sommelier there was so cool. Loaded with suggestions and just a really friendly dude. We also started with the Mussels and Foie Gras - both equally amazing. The mussels were delicious.. I LOVE mussels, and ever since I left Boston, I haven't had any good ones.. these were awesome. I wanted more. The Foie Gras was obviously delicious..  Prepared to perfection and it was gone in less than 30 seconds.   For our entrees, I got the lamb and B got the Beef Tenderloin. For our sides we got the Mac n Cheese & Grilled Asparagus. I'm not even kidding when I say that we did not leave ONE bite on our plates. We devoured everything, and all of it was perfect. Especially the bottle of wine we split with it.  To wrap up the meal, we got the crème brulee to share, and as my photo shows, they personalized it for my special day. That along with 2 glasses of port, and we were good to go..   Staff don't mess around, they are at your beck and call from the moment you pull up to valet.   I will say this place is not cheap, and seemingly only appropriate for special occasions, however, I will absolutely go back again and again and again, birthday or not. Seriously one of the most delicious dinners ive ever had, period.

Some things never change.. unfortunately, RA on Mill Ave. is one of them.   I went the other night for a Graphic Design networking event which involved drink tickets and my god, the bartenders could not have been more pissed that I ordered anything other than beer with them. If I would have known a Long Beach Ice Tea was such a pain in the ass I would have stuck with $1 Happy Hour Sake & Sopporo, but whatever. Sushi there is mediocre, I had a few different rolls, and nothing seemed very fresh. I cant say it was bad, but i've had much better in the valley. I think the appeal of this place is the happy hour specials they offer.. they do have good deals but overall I think RA cares more about image than good service & quality food.

Lets just say that I go here for lunch at least twice a week. As does the rest of my office. It is that good. Not just because its a hop skip and a jump from my building, but every sub I have ever had here, minus the Philly cheese steak which we will discuss later, has been tasty and fresh and simply delightful.  I've tried The Dodge City - Pepperoni, Salami, Provolone, etc, .. The Caribou- Turkey Breast, Double Provolone, Avocado, LTM etc... & The Comstock - Roast Beef, Provolone etc.. I love everything about all of these EXCEPT for the fact that they do not *actually* use avocado slices, its more like, avocado paste. Not guacamole. Paste. Still tasty if you can get past the texture, but I would prefer the real deal.   Now like I said, Ive also had the Philly Cheese Steak. Ive got to be honest. It tasted like vomit and old cow. There wasn't enough cheese and the peppers on it were overwhelming. Silvermine either needs to a.) alter this recipe immediately or b.) completely nix it from the menu. It was g.r.o.s.s.  Let me give you a little money saving hint while I'm at it.. It is cheaper to order a sammich that has all the toppings you want then removing something rather than adding an extra topping to a sammich. if that makes sense.. At almost $2ea for some of them, ie: pasty avocado, you will certainly save a little.. especially if you eat here at the rate that me and my fellow Terraleverians do.

Ohhhh Cheba Hut, "WHERE THE ONLY THING FRIED IS THE OCCASIONAL CUSTOMER!" - exactly as I remember.  I stopped in here for a quick bite and to rekindle old memories of high school.. as usual, the line is longer than it should be, because it takes forever to place and receive your order, possibly because everyone who works here IS ACTUALLY STONED. I don't mind though. A sub shop with sandwiches with names like "The Kind", "Kush" & "AZ Homegrown", and sandwich sizes labeled as Nug (4") Pinner (8") &  Blunt (12"), this has got to be expected. And I do believe that there is an Oz. of love in each sammich they make as well. Lately I've been on this mushroom kick so I decided on the Majic Mushroom Portabella.. consisting of Portabella mushrooms with their home-grown teriyaki glaze, then topped with green bell peppers, pineapple & pepper jack cheese. Fn' F'yeah is all I have to say about this magnificent piece of lunch. I used to order the AK-47 or the Pakalolo, which are both awesome as well, but my shroom sandwich was spot on. I loved it.  This place is definitely worth the wait.. the only reason they lost a star is because they're slow, and I was in a bit of a hurry.. still, i'm totally going back, dude.

What I want to know is who the hell puts sweet relish on a burger? Especially a burger that already has dill pickles.. I mean I love pickles as much as the next asshole, but I fn HATE sweet relish, so it pretty much ruined the whole thing.   Aside from that, my curly fries were perfect, and they have Cherry Coke.. so here, have 2 stars.

The Marquee Theatre is pretty much like going to your horrible mother-in-laws house. Its a terrible idea that you fret over.. But you go because there is some bomb ass reward, like a home cooked meal, chocolate mousse pie and a bottle of champagne not even your wealthiest friend could afford, and because well, you have to, to keep your marriage together. The Marquee is like this. I go because one of the loves of my music life are playing a show there and I wouldn't miss it for the world.. I cant miss it!  I basically hate every single thing about this place. I literally get bummed out when my favorite bands pass through Phoenix and choose to play at this shithole.   The sound sucks, the bar is almost impossible to get through to, order 2 at a time to be safe, and don't expect the bartenders to be friendly. I know there are a million people there trying to get drunk, but come on, laugh a little bit. Do something besides yell and question my completely legit ID. Its hot, dirty, the bathroom situation is a disaster. I don't even know how so many grown ass women can destroy a bathroom like the ones at Marquee, but I think it might be safe to assume dudes use the ladies room from time to time. Either that or bitches are peeing on the floor and TeePeeing the stalls for fun. Its absolutely baffling. Lines are long, parking is a nightmare, your best bet is to park elsewhere and walk. Don't piss off the security guards either, they are all obviously raging roid monkeys that will kick you out for even looking at them wrong. And one thing I HATE the most, they stamp your hands so much that it looks like a 4 year old took a box of markers to your hand,  with ink that doesn't come off for 4 days. Cant you just give me a neon colored wrist band and call it a day? I have enough ink on my body as it is.  Like I said, I only come here because I have no choice, and yes, I will continue to come here.. I just hope one day Phoenix opens up a venue comparable to the size of Marquee, but actually turn it into a place you want to go to, not just because you have to.  The end.

I am not a Vegan, nor am I a vegetarian. I tried this lifestyle in my early 20's and I just couldn't be faithful. I love meat way too much. That doesn't mean I won't accept alternatives here and there. I felt somewhat healthier as a vegetarian and do enjoy eating like one once in a while. So yesterday I tried Green.. Now let me just say, a lot of places I have tried like this have been seriously disappointing. Either it tastes like hydrogenated dog shit or looks like it.. and I once found a rubber band in my Black-eyed Pea Cake at Blossom, but we'll save that story for another review.. Green however, did not disappoint.   Edamame to start, because I am a super fan of it and eat it whenever possible.. I like that they served it with lime. Something I had never thought to add, but it was a nice touch. Then I had the Apricot Miso with mock chicken and pan fried noodles. Certainly an interesting dish, with a stir fry type mix of pineapple, dried apricots, sliced apples, broccoli and some other vegetables, in a sweet yet kinda spicy sauce which was really good. My buddy had the Original "G" spicy Po boy, and it was also tasty. You could barely tell the difference between "real" and "mock", which is hard to do. The interior is super cute and funky. I liked that, but there was absolutely no where to sit, so we went outside and sat in the shade, which wasn't too terrible.. also a good sign that summer is ending sooner than later.   One complaint I do have... bring your own fork! I know it sounds silly but they only have forks carved out of wood, which break upon entering pretty much anything I tried to use it for. .   Definitely try Green. Vege or not, its worth a visit.

Any place with a boisterous Bostonian as an owner and Red Sox memorabilia plastered on the walls automatically makes me a fan. The fact that their pizza is delicious makes me an even bigger fan. All these people who say the counter service is rude have obviously never been to Boston, and cannot appreciate the assholeic nature of its inhabitants. I mean, do you really think the people who are taking your order really give a shit about how you're doing? I don't. Anyway, I ordered 8 pizzas for the office the other day and tried 3 different kinds, yes I can slaughter an ungodly amount of pizza, and I don't care about the repercussions. Call me a fat kid if you want.. The crust is perfection. The cheese, oh god, the cheese is a mouthgasm, the toppings are all fresh and delicious and the slices are HUGE. They also sell em by the slice @ $3.25, but considering what I just said, its totally fair. They have a potato, bacon and cheese kind that I am dying to try, and since lunch is in an hour and its a 45 second walk away, I'm probably going to go satisfy my craving...   and then some...   My only complaint is that they don't deliver.. but other than that, its wicked pissah.

Now that I no longer live alone, I try to embrace any me time I can find, therefore eating alone is one of my very favorite things to do. Even though sitting solo makes people look at you like you have 23 heads and/or brings sympathetic half assed smiles, I truly love it. The other day, while walking down Mill (after a very successful interview), I stumbled upon Cafe Boa.. all I can say is fn fyeah!  It is a lot "fancier" than I had expected. My goal for the afternoon was to find a delicious salad and a glass of good wine. Not only did I find that here (I had the butter cup lettuce with grilled chicken breast, sliced almonds, avocado, heirloom tomato & sunflower sprouts topped with champagne/lemon vinaigrette), but I also found delicious bread served with hummus, olive oil from Queen Creek, the best Calamata olives I've ever eaten (to start) AND the most delicious Pomegranate iced tea in the whole entire world. Seriously, whatever you choose from the menu, try the Pom Tea, its to die for. The menu has some delicious unique options and their wine list is enormous. There aren't many offered just by the glass so since I am a Cabernet girl, I tried the Girard (Napa Valley, CA 2006).. I was a fan. The service was wonderful, and my waiter was very helpful and informative. Also really really good looking so that was a plus. Everyone in here was smiling, laughing and generally enjoying the whole atmosphere. I would really like to come here after work to split a bottle and try the fresh oysters, heirloom carrot soup and Rosemary ravioli they have available at some point too.. now that its so close to my new office and all. :o)  Cafe Boa is extremely inexpensive for the options they have, and is pretty much a hidden gem (literally, its kinda hard to find). I see myself returning again and again and again.

Next time I want to party with my mom this is where I will go, because every single person in there aside from the people at my table were old enough to be my parents. And most of them were apparently swingers..   Lovely.   50+ year old husband/wife swappers looking to score.. The mental pictures are scarring my mind. Excuse me while I barf.  Anyway a few friends met up here to watch some football and drink some cheap beer. Who knew it would turn into Beerfestival 2009 accompanied by way too many shots of Jameson. I think this is the only way we all could stand the atmosphere. To top it off the food was not good at all, my Chicken Chimi tasted a little bit like vomit and the sampler was pretty much a roasted pineapple slice with a mound of hard potato strings and 3 overcooked shrimp on skewers growing out of it. To top it off, I was in the ladies room with 25 cougars and a mouse ran across the floor.. imagine 25 half naked 50 year old women bouncing up and down, arms flailing and screaming at the top of their lungs.. because that is what was going on. Ridiculous.   I will only go back here if Georgie S. drags me here again for drunken football debauchery.. otherwise, count me out.

This review is for the bar ONLY!   First time I came in here it was packed to this gills, and no where to sit so we left.. Next!  Second time I came here I met 2 of the strangest old women I've ever encountered who tried to reel me into a marketing scam, wouldn't shut up about how lovely I was and how both of them wanted me as their daughter, then performed Reiki on me and my friend, waving their hands all around us eyes closed and chanting.. in front of the everyone. I couldn't help but bust out in laughter. Bartender laughed too, then poured more bourbon in my glass and winked.  I really liked this place aside from the geriatric nonsense. Great vibe & I loved the entrance, you walk right through the kitchen and can observe the chefs working their magic. The interior is dark and sexy, with some of the coolest wallpaper I've ever seen.  I am hoping to write an update soon, because I desperately want to try the steak that I have heard so much about, but $60 for dinner is a little out of my budget, thanks to our economical crisis and being unemployed. *sigh*

I am obsessed with Blip.fm & Pandora. I keep a notebook with me at all times, specifically to write down new music I need to buy that I come across using these 2 magnificent musical tools. When I need to track down a new find, I will go here. I have loyalty to Eastside. I frequently visited when I lived here before, and have never gone in not finding what I was looking for. Its smaller than it used to be, but its still awesome. Staff are friendly, super helpful too.. And they have a sweet collection of vinyls, which is rad. I will probably be back here within the next week, at least once.

Let me preface this review by saying I am enormous Burger fan, I love them. I eat at least 2-3 a week, no problem and it is absolutely safe to say that I would choose a cheesebuger as my last meal on earth.. I once called In & Out my true love, but last night my friends, I met someone new and have fallen hard... his name is Delux, and he is amazing.  I arrived here really late to meet up with friends, so I didn't spend too much time inside.. and I never actually saw a menu, but from what I gather, the place is totally popular based off the amount of people and the wait I was told about, also that they have a great beer list (also a full bar) and some wonderful orange special sauce that you definitely need to dip your french fries (and whatever else) in. The interior reminded me of something the wonderful Chef Barbara Lynch would do. The Butcher Shop in Boston is very similar, aesthetically anyway. Since I was late and it was packed, I didnt get to order, so I just want to extend an enormous thank you to the wonderful Georgie S. for sharing with me the most amazing burger I have ever had. In my life. Hands down. I was in meat heaven last night, and the fries were freakin' awesome too, served in a miniature shopping cart no less. Top that off with a Makers on the rocks, and you have one, very happy Nikki.  In & Out... I would like to apologize for cheating. I still love you Animal Style #2, but it was worth it, I am in love and I now have a new favorite.

If you want to test your level of agility, Camelback is a good place to do so. I've successfully hiked this mountain before, years ago.. but I will admit. I don't work out anymore. I'm relatively lazy unless there is a swimming pool, softball glove or football in front of me, so when asked to go on my first hike in years, I couldn't say no. I need to get my ass back in shape.   I was told, the hike to the hike is a hike. And it was indeed, about a 10 min. walk give or take, but its good for "warming up" if you're trying to be optimistic. Once we hit the trail, I got about 20 minutes into it, and FML, I was seeing stars and my lungs were on FIRE. At this point my body was telling me, "Nikki, you've been gone for 5 years, you are no longer acclimated to this climate, you are dehydrated, you are no longer 20, you shouldn't have had so much to drink last night and you're on day 3 of no smoking, your lungs are f'd up..Stop"   Alas, I would rather stop than push myself into heat exhaustion. If anything, take this review as a warning that no matter how badassical you think you are, drink tons of water and take it easy.. it was a nice little wake up call and since I am not a quitter (aside from the cigarettes), I am totally going to concur this mountain again. The beautiful views of the valley are so worth it.

I have yet to hike any of the trails on this mountain without projectile vomiting.   Tried the Summit Trail the other day and seriously thought I was going to die. If you choose this route you're going to get dirty, and you're going to get confused. I also recommend wearing pants if you are as clumsy as I am, otherwise you will end up with 400 bruises, scrapes and a substantial sized gash that might require stitches because you WILL end up crawling at some point, unless you're a rock climber..... Or Jesus. Oh, and there are scorpions. I finally saw one in real life and almost shit my pants.   PARKING SUUUUUCKS, especially on the weekends.. Also, AT&T does not work here, shocking, so don't attempt this alone or without TONS of water unless you are an extremely experienced hiker. I certainly am not and It may be a while before I attempt this bitch again, because im pretty sure Camelback Mountain is trying to kill me.

This place is so cool. There is just really no other way to describe it. I love coming here. I love eating here. I love the people who work here. I love their burgers and I really love their sweet potato fries. They taste like dessert. I love their martinis, I've tried a few, and if you ask the bartender for a "surprise martini" like I did, he will bounce back with a cherrylimeaide thing.. delish! I love the sinks in the bathroom and I loved my egg white omelet I ate this morning along with the muddled grape fruit drink on the brunch menu, I forget the name of it but its yummy.. I also love this place because I won a gift card for them at the OYE last week, and I never win anything. ever. I now associate winning with FEZ and that is just awesome.

I feel kinda silly writing about a place that already has over 200+ amazing reviews, but this is the internet and goddamnit, my opinion matters. But its true.. All 200+ rave reviews are spot on...   Matts. Is. The. Shit.   If it weren't for the long-ass wait in the three thousand degree AZ summer heat, I'd probably be there on a regular, but sorry dudes, I am a ginger kid, and I burn. I also have no soul, but you all already knew that.  Anyway.  I was skeptical for, ohhh, about a year... yes, it took me that long to actually muster up the patience to deal with the wait.. but I have very persuasive friends who have really good ideas., so last Saturday, I went, and the fact that its been almost a week since i've tasted the sweet spuds in their hashbrowns makes me want to cry. They are seriously, one of the most delicious things ive ever eaten. I got the Chop & Chick.. because i love pigs and eating them. The pork was perfect, nicely seasoned, tender and delicious. I got my eggs over medium, because egg yolk is one of my favorite things to dip shit in, and an order of home fries because the waitress said the hash browns were "kinda funky, not like usual", that day.. but she lied. or maybe she didn't, but my friend got them and either way, they were amazing. My friends got the 5 spot (breakfast sandwich thing) & the daily special (some chorizo mexicany mash up of yum), which were both equally amazing, but for real, my yolk covered pork chop superseded anything those fools were eating. Its been on my mind for days.  As usual, I drank way too much coffee, but what I should have done was order a chocolate milk like my good friend Georgie S. had.. For whatever reason, it was better than any other chocolate milk in the universe.  Its small, cramped, kinda retro, no booze and there is no bathroom.. but whatever, I like places like this. its totally worth it, and did I mention its CHEAP?!  Go here at least once in your life. Make sure to get the HB's and visit The Downtown Phoenix Farmers Market across the street when you're finished. Its the perfect way to start your Saturday.

L O V E  I am certainly adding this place to my growing list of favorite downtown bars. The vibe was so spot on, I could probably come here 3 nights a week and not be mad about it. I love the seating, even though it makes absolutely no sense. Comfy couches and chairs big enough for Brad E. and I to share and fit both of our badonkadonks in.. trust me on that.. junk. in. the. trunk.  I ran into Joel L. here also, which is always a pleasure. Apparently the tomato soup and grilled cheese is absolutely phenomenal, and I am craving it more than anything in the entire world right now. The bartender boosted my ego about 63 notches by telling me what a lovely redhead I was, so thank you sir. You are the most wonderful person of the weekend. Their beer list is also killer and the outdoor seating area is big enough for a frat party.  I honestly cant wait to come back here. If anyone, I mean, ANYONE is in the mood for The Roosevelt, call a bitch, I am so there.

They say, good things come in small packages, like Tiffany boxes and Asians. Stinkweeds is also a stellar example of this.. Its definitely not the biggest music store in the valley, but its certainly got the most charm.   Endless supplies of Indie Records, old and new, and they carry tons of albums and vinyl that I haven't been able to find in other stores. If they don't have what you are looking for, they will special order it for you, and once its been received they will promptly let you know.. I know this because they just called me, to tell me my selection was in.. which reminded me that I needed to review these wonderful people.   The staff here are awesome.. totally knowledgeable with their music and also at recommending artists to fit your taste.. I went home with over $70 of music the other day.. 2 artists of which I hadn't heard of but ended up loving.   Whether you're looking for new or used, they WILL have what you're looking for, and if not, they will make it happen anyway.. and all reasonably priced, maybe even a little cheaper than other stores I've been in. And if you're lucky, you might catch a free show outside their entrance like I did! See, bigger isn't always better.. not in the case anyway ;o)

Ummmmmmm. 32 douche bags in camouflage pants and an endless supply of cougars pretty much sums up my Thursday night at The Vig. I was wicked wicked excited to try this spot because everyone else seems to love it so much. Even though my first impression of the crowd wasn't the greatest, I too, am a fan  Fantastic wine options, many bottles were split amongst friends and no-one, not even my asshole connoisseur friend complained. If I weren't so intoxicated, I would be able to tell you what exactly it was, that I was drinking.. but I cant.. Carmen something? Their menu is awesome, lots of variety. The Double Down Hummus plate is the shit. Lovely outdoor seating area to boot. I hear Sundays are the best to come, mostly for their phenomenal drink specials. I could really see myself loving this place in late October.. not only because it is my favorite time of year, but also because there is nothing better than scarves and boots, wrapped in a shawl, enjoying the autumn air with a nice glass of Cabernet.

The last time I was at The Vig, they tricked me.. You see, they have these glass doors that they open up in the back of the restaurant when its nice out, and sometimes, when you go through those doors from the outside to take a trip to the loo, they close them on you, so like an asshole, you attempt to walk back outside the way you came, but instead you bash your head and knees into the glass window in front of 35 people. Be mindful of this.  But hey, at least they had the most amazing wine specials that night and I was saucy enough to laugh it off and take a bow. And then I hid in the bocce ball pit for the remainder of the evening where I somehow acquired 200 bruises.   I love the Vig. Even when I'm embarrassing the shit out of myself.

I just want to start this review out by saying if you think wearing heels to the Sandbar is a good idea, you are f'ing retarded.. And yet, I see the same hoes wearing the same hoe-y heels and complaining that they cant walk and that the sand in between their toes is disgusting. God people are irritating.   I don't love this place. In fact, I don't even really like this place. I feel like everyone who goes there has a giant stick up their ass, stares at you like you have 10 goddamn heads and the dudes.. don't even get me started on the dudes. Lets just say douche to the bag. But pluralized. 500 times.  I once cut my foot open on an enormous shard of glass that was peeking out of the sand because I was dumb enough to think it was a good idea to empty my shoe out and step on the ground. Don't do this. Don't even take your shoe off ever. Also, don't get in that water. I swear a layer of syphilis was floating on the top of it last time I was there. I think a decent rake job on their pseudo beach is a must after every shift.. and perhaps some chlorine, or better yet...  bleach. Seriously, think about it.  The one cool thing that ever happened at the Sandbar in the handful of times i've been forced to come here was that a dude bought 100 beers. He bought ONE HUNDRED BEERS and passed them out to whoever was close. I think I walked away with 3, and who the hell doesn't love free beer. Other than that, this place is enormous and confusing and dirty and there are random shards of glass and STD's floating around everywhere.   Sorry dudes, im just, not a fan.

Holy shit this place has gone down hill.. like all the way to the bottom of the hill, into the water below, sinking to the deepest depths which then sucked itself into the fiery center of the earth.   Metro center, is now Ghettro center. I was honestly afraid to walk in here.. but it was on my way home and I wanted a new pair of shoes. Here is a recap of todays ghettocenter adventure..  I park my car, and am approached by two enormous black rappers asking me to buy their homemade CD with "Akon on track 12!!", in order to help them support Phoenix. Are you kidding me? How the hell is this supporting my city?! This is supporting your weed habit, dicks.   NO.  Next.   I walk into entrance 1, and am surprisingly not shocked to see that I am the only person in the entire mall. I proceed to walk through the place and hit up every shoe store possible.. this was manageable because there were a total of 12 stores left open in the whole place and 8 of them were shoe stores. The others had names like K Momo, and HotLove filled with racks of what I call disposable clothing.. shit that only lasts 4 washes before its in pieces.  I walk the entire mall and browse every store in under 20 minutes.. all the while being eyed by every male, and female in the place. Maybe because I was the only white girl. I don't know. Saddened by the state of this mall, as a result of the state of our economy, I become more and more depressed about being unemployed. I become so depressed that I indulge in a Cinnabon, the only food available besides Annies Pretzels. I almost ate 2, but the fiber filler in the dough got to me, so I felt like vomiting instead. I leave the mall, thinking I have the right exit, but I was wrong. I needed to be upstairs rather than down. Unfortunately there were no stores open to be used as a landmark to identify which exit I was at, only corridors, so I got a little confused. Finally I find my way out to the parking lot, as a tumbleweed rolls by, with a group of crackheads peering at me from around the corner, I find myself back at my car. I leave, satisfied with my purchase of super cute Chuck Taylor's, but vow never to return again. ever. I would rather go to Chandler Fashion Center, which in itself is the biggest oxy-moron Ive ever heard of..   Apparently this place used to be cool.. but I'm pretty sure I was an infant when it was at its high point.   Sad.

Most people would think it is absolutely insane to go for a hike at 1pm in the middle of August in Phoenix.. me on the other hand, invite this sort of absurdity and embrace doing things out of the norm. Determined to not have a repeat of my Camelback mountain fail, I approached the trails of Dreamy Draw fully hydrated and ready to kick some ass.   There are a few different trails you can follow based off the level of difficulty you can manage. To be quite honest, I have no idea which trail I was on because I'm pretty sure I got lost at one point.. and if not lost, severely off track. Thankfully I found my way, but holy shit, I got my ass kicked in a few spots. This area is pretty fascinating, you don't even realize you are situated in the middle of the city because of its serenity.. However when you reach the peaks, there are wonderful 360° views. Horses and dogs are welcome, but apparently a lot of people do not understand the concept of cleaning up shit because there was a good amount of fecal matter scattered about.  Not only is Dreamy Draw awesome for hiking, but picnics and bike rides too. There are plenty of tables & charcoal grills.. They also have restrooms, but be advised, the stalls do not have doors. There is plenty of parking, and you can also maintain cell phone reception in all areas.. even if your provider is the suck that is known as AT&T.  One thing that was pointed out to me that was super sketch was the amount of shirtless men wandering into the depths of the hills on the other side of the parking lot... not sure if this is true, but apparently it is some hook up spot for homosexuals.. who knows.. who cares.. to each his own.  Highly recommend this area to anyone, at any agility level. It was not as strenuous as other locations, but certainly a great workout.

I can't understand why so many people give this place terrible reviews. Its a sports bar for shitsake, what do you expect?   I don't care what anyone else says, this place makes the cut for any sports fan in need of a venue with massive TV's, greasy bar food and plenty of beer. Cheap beer I may add. They also have cheap drinks. $3 for a bloody Mary whose mix is comparable to my beloved Zing Zang.. I think YES.   There is a covered outdoor patio, so even the smoker sports fans of America can fully enjoy themselves, without even being rained on should some fluke freaky ass storm miraculously make its way into the valley of the sun.. unlikely, but hey, im just throwing it out there.  Their wings are delicious and meaty. Their nachos are nachos.. cant really eff that up. Their fried party platter thing is a heart attack on a plate, and nothing fancy, but goddamn delicious. The sandwiches are standard as well as the salads.. but come on people, this is where we go to get shnockered and watch some football, not to indulge in a gourmet meal.   16th St. Bar is A-O-Fn-K with me.. And one of the best parts is that there is a Sports Authority right down the street so when you get that urge to purchase a new baseball glove or junior size football because your hands are too small for the official size, you can go during halftime.  Ka Pow!

I secretly moved back to this area of the country strictly for the In-N-Out Burger factor.. Nothing anywhere compares to it. In fact, after my last visit I was reminded how perfectly delicious it is and I am changing my last meal on earth to an animal style burger, well done fries and a Neapolitan milkshake. It really is the American dream.  I am always fascinated when I walk into any on of their establishments. Always clean yet so disorderly.. The lines are always retarded long, and there are always people standing everywhere, but somehow they never fail to deliver every meal hot, fresh, delicious and FAST. I have NEVER encountered a broken ATM inside either.  Not everyone is aware of their "secret menu", with items such as the 2x4, flying Dutchman, the protein style burger and my fave, animal style... In fact, the secret items actually outnumber the items legitimately on the menu which only consists of a Hamburger, Cheeseburger, Double-Double, French Fries, Coca-Cola products and three shakes: chocolate, vanilla and strawberry, of course. I'm pretty sure you can download a PDF of their menu somewhere online, but even if you don't know the terms, the employees at In-N-Out will pretty much do anything to a burger if you ask them.. I also recommend the fries well done.. otherwise they are kind of soggy.   Now I am hungry, I think I've decided whats for lunch!

I asked my buddy where I could acquire a delicious dark beer last night, and immediately was told to get to the Yard House because they serve at least 100 different beers from all over the world. I had also never been here before, so there was no argument from me..   I saw the Chocolate Stout on the menu and BAM, my mind was made up. It was such a perfect decision too.. definitely recommend trying it. Being adventurous, I also had their Orange Blossom Cream Ale and a Lindeman's Framboise. Interesting combination I know, but YUM.   Onto the food -  we started with the Grilled Korean BBQ beef, (boneless beef short ribs marinated in garlic, soy and brown sugar with jasmine rice, sesame spinach, carrots, bean sprouts and green onions) - very good, great flavor, nice portion, could even be ordered as your main course IMO. For my entree I had the Mushroom Lettuce Wraps, (stir fried, smoked tofu, pine nuts and green onions with three dipping sauces and shiitake & portabella mushrooms), also very good, and healthy!! My friend ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which had a mushroom sauce, sun-dried tomatoes and garlic mashed potatoes. Not my first choice, but it was very tasty and the mashed potatoes were so creamy, my mouth is watering thinking about them! For Dessert I had the Youngberry Chocolate which is Lindeman's Framboise & Young's chocolate Stout together (since both were delicious, I had to try them together, naturally). Prices ranged from reasonable to pretty expensive, the drinks were definitely in the very expensive range, as reflected in our well over $100 tab.. I will definitely be returning for happy hour one of these days for the lower drink prices. Service was great, bathrooms were super clean, all in all, I am a fan!!

I LOVED IT!   Any place with a stellar beer menu, Betty Page look-alike bartender's and paintings of naked ladies all over the walls is A-FREAKIN-OK with me!

This place has always been douchbag central in my eyes, the one by ASU anyway, but I came to this new location last night for a going away party, and was pleasantly surprised. It reminded me of an ice house, but classier, with misters and food and a decent drink menu. They also play really fantastic music.. first 4 songs were all some of my favorite bands, including Passion Pit who came out of Boston, which was shocking.. and radical. Cant say Ive been to any other place that had such an impressive play list, and I am a bit of a music snob. Their nachos were enormous, and delightful, I ate every last bite, and then indulged myself in 2 more tacos after I had 3 more $2 Pacificos. Luckily for me my metabolism is amazing so I can do things like this, and I could have kept eating too because the tacos were delicious. I tried both chicken and steak, equally amazing. Our waitress was very patient, even though it was a table of 20 drunk ex co-workers of McFarlane Toys, which translates into 20 drunk super-nerds discussing comic books and video games.. She kept our drinks flowing and the food coming without missing a beat. I could tell she was overwhelmed, but nice work anyhow.. way to keep your cool. I did enjoy this place, but I am taking into account that it was Tuesday night, and really, no one else was in there.. so on a busy night this place could quite possibly suck, or be an exact replica of the Dos Gringos I used to know and had no problem forgetting.. either way, I had a good time, and I cant deny a place that has excellent music.

Whoever named this company was absolutely spot on, because the last 6 phone calls I have made to these people have connected me to giant cockbagdoucheyasshats.  Lets talk about customer service for a minute.. more specifically how there is no absolute definition but rather that it is often seen as an activity, performance measurement and a philosophy. That is why, generally speaking, one single customer service definition does not exist.. Here are some definitions of customer service in use today:  "Customer service is the ability to provide a service or product in the way that it has been promised"  "Customer service is about treating others as you would like to be treated yourself"  "Customer service is an organization's ability to supply their customers' wants and needs"  "Customer Service is a phrase that is used to describe the process of taking care of our customers in a positive manner"  "Customer Service is any contact between a customer and a company, that causes a negative or positive perception by a customer"  "Customer service is a process for providing competitive advantage and adding benefits in order to maximize the total value to the customer"  "Customer Service is the commitment to providing value added services to external and internal customers, including attitude knowledge, technical support and quality of service in a timely manner"  "Customer service is a proactive attitude that can be summed up as: I care and I can do."  Okay, now can someone tell me who hired the m-f-ers that are supposed to be customer service agents here because Cox is sucking major ass with this, and for the record, I am currently unemployed and I know for a goddamn fact that I could easily do their jobs a million times better even if all I had to work with was Braille. It is not hard. You deal with cable television. DVR's. Phones. Internet.. seriously.. this shit has been around for years and it is not difficult to maintain... get your shit together Cox, and don't give me the run around by transferring me to 17 different assholes that essentially all transfer me back to a bitchy robot that "didnt understand what I said".. all I ask is that I have functioning internet, and when I call you to tell you that my connection is wak, fix it. What the hell else am I paying you for?   Mini rant over.. internet cafe, thank you for your assistance.

Subsequently if you allow your reviews to post to Twitter, more importantly the shitty ones, you will most likely get followers and DM's from Co. reps.. Within 10 minutes of posting my previous review on Cox, I had 2 reps contact (and follow) me asking if I still needed help with my internet, and also to assure me that "I wont have anymore issues".. we'll see about this, but I had to add another star for that. Although its wicked awesome that this happened, I do not feel that Twitter is the most logical place for tech support. (Although this is yet another reason that I love it).  I am done talking about these people now.

There is nothing I hate more than a snobby waitress who is inattentive in an EMPTY restaurant. There is no reason for this. I've been a waitress before, I know how it works.. you make around $3 an hour which means your living is made from your tips. Your job is to help me, and not be pissed off about it. So to the waitress in the tavern with the pink eye shadow, you should probably find a new job if you are going to continue on the path you are on. You were a bitch. (yeah I said it)  Anyway, I had the Club wrap.. it was whatever, not great but not shit, and I hated that it was served with tortilla chips instead of fries. I suppose I could have specified what I really wanted, or sent them back, but I had no idea I would get chips, of all things and anyway pink eyes would have probably thought this the biggest burden in the whole world.  Luckily, for them, I will probably go back. Its conveniently located near my office and everyone else seems to think its pretty great. You will have your chance to redeem yourself Tavern on Mill, but please don't disappoint.

I had been craving a steak since March and Its restaurant week. Naturally you should pick the most unaffordable place ever and Georgie S. has brilliant ideas. I make a rez. We arrive 15 minutes late, fashionably, of course. Complimentary Valet is available which is always a star. This place is classy, and full of old men. We receive not one, but two waiters, Ben you're amazing. Spend over 2 hours drinking overpriced wine and eating a $29 three course meal that included a chop salad, filet Mignon with shrimp scampi & crème brûlée - all on a perfectly spotless table because the bus boys don't allow you to even drop a crumb. SCORE, what a deal! All of it was perfect/delicious, except the cream corn which was more like soggy corn bread. Barf. My crème brûlée was heavenly and the caramelized sugar was perfect. We left fully fulfilled, literally, and I liked it a lot, but I probably wont be coming here much outside of restaurant week cause its pret-tay pricey..

Despite the fact that the sushi bar stools are for midgets and they gave me a dirty wine glass, it is quite possible that the sushi chefs at Celsius fed me the most wonderful sushi I've ever had in Phoenix. I tried the Spicy Yellow Tail, Spicy Tuna, Soft Shell Crab, Crunchy Special & one other Roll that I cant remember. All of it was superb. The fish were fresh, the spice was just enough, the size of the rolls were perfect (I hate it when I cant fit the whole thing in my mouth...) and I literally couldn't stop eating it. That's when you know you've found a gem- when you cant put your chopsticks down. I'm glad too because I have been waiting a long time to find a sushi spot here in the valley that I actually enjoy going to.  Now if only @CelsiusSushiBar would start updating their Twitter with promised daily specials!!

I was put in charge of planning this years annual holiday party for my company. Since event planning is one of my absolute favorite things to do, I was more than pleased. Everyone knows that the most important component for these functions is the booze and food so I had to find a catering company that would meet my foodie expectations while delivering a professional and thorough outcome. Heidi's was referred to me by a good friend, so I called them up.   Drew ended up being our coordinator, and was so helpful and just plain awesome throughout the entire process. I poured out my ideas from the passed apps to the centerpieces to the ambiance I wanted to create. Not only did he deliver everything I expected, but he went above and beyond to make sure I got everything I had asked for.   Upon arrival, they wasted no time setting up. The spread of appetizers they arranged was lovely, and I never remember once running out of anything. They kept it stocked up for my drunk and hungry guests. They supplied a bartender and bar.. brought all the tables, linens, centerpieces, waiters and heat lamps to keep everyone warm since it was outdoors and kinda chilly. Everything worked out seamlessly, and I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome. Once the party was over, they had everything broken down and cleaned up within a half hour. They even took out all the trash which was unexpected. The guys that worked our party were so nice too. Drew even called the next day to make sure I was happy.   I highly recommended Heidi's to anyone planning any sort of event. They are so accommodating and wonderful, I cannot wait to work with them again.

OH MY VIETNAMESE GOD. You have clearly touched down in Glendale...  I've been here twice now, and wow. Its just, amazing. I am a huge fan of Vietnamese cuisine, and have tried some pretty phenomenal places throughout my travels, but hands down, Avina is a gem, although I don't think its that big of a secret considering the amount of patrons that constantly occupy the place.   The perfect combo...  1.) BÌ CUN - shredded pork spring rolls 2.) PH TÔM C BT - Beef & Shrimp  + Sriracha & Hoison hot sauces to top everything off because I love my Pho SPICY!!! 3.) Coffee Boba (amazing amazing flavor)  They also provide you with the necessary sprouts, mint leaves & lime, of course..  I think I'm in love.

Holy delicious cupcake Batman!  Okay, I haven't actually BEEN to their location, but today, my new office neighbors were gracious enough to deliver 2 dozen of these scrumptious little treats to say hello..   WELL HELL-OFREAKINO!  I'm not sure i've encountered a better cupcake (NOT EVEN AT THE INFAMOUS MAGNOLIA BAKERY IN MANHATTAN)! Their was a mix of about 5 different flavors, I consumed 2, within 2 minutes.. Red Velvet, which was absolutely heavenly & Chocolate Marshmallow, I will admit the chocolate was a little rich, but anything filled with marshmallow fluff is A-OK in my book! I think I have diabetes now, sorry Wilford Brimley.  Their marketing dept is on the ball with their daily whispers on twitter too, seriously genius! It is taking everything I have in my body and soul not to sprint into the kitchen to try the vanilla that is SCREAMING my name.

I have to be honest, I really do not like this place.   At all.   I've been coming here for years . . I practically used to live here back when I was dumb enough to date boys who are in bands. I never remember liking it then, and after last nights show, my mind hasn't changed much.   Its small. Its dirty. Its unorganized. I find it really weird that its located in a strip mall next to a burrito shop. On a sold out night, its next to impossible to get a drink at the over-sized bar that takes up 70% of the venue. Order 2 at a time... double fisting is the only way to booze at The Clubhouse. They offer food.. that is prepared at the restaurant next door and brought over.. which is also weird, but the nachos looked totally decent. The bathroom situation is terrible.. With only one stall, I waited in line for over 20 minutes. I know we women like to take our time, but come on bitches! Hurry up and pee!  The parking lot is a zoo, and there are never any spots. Park in the business complex right next door instead.. just don't let you little sister sneak out of a show early to sleep in the car because you will return with it surrounded by cops.   I know I've said absolutely nothing positive - I realize that I am a Yelp snob and I notice every single detail at any place I am at. Especially the bad ones.. But seriously, I really do not have anything good to say. Unfortunately this is just where my favorite bands decide to book so I'm forced to just deal with it.

I am not going to say much about this place because the only thing I really liked about it were the light fixtures.  I tried the Crystal Chicken. Bland.  I tried the Crispy Sring rolls. Overcooked.  The only thing that was yummy was the #51.. and I have no idea what it was called but my friend got it and I tried it and it was pretty alright.  They have a koi pond inside right when you walk in, but I was disturbed at the size of the fish in that little pool.. Definitely not enough room, and I'm thinking this might be a violation, and i'm looking into it. I may eat fish, but I don't believe the living ones should be confined like that.. I certainly don't like elevators, do you?

This place is funky, and fun, and I have no idea why I hadn't been there until last week...   I came here the other day for a birthday, and my god, am I glad that she chose this place!! Its got that indie boho feel, which I love, lots of hanging lights outside and the most powerful misters in the entire universe... So what if my hair turned to a frizzfro, i was sitting outside, for hours, and was not even hot. The waitstaff were awesome, and really really ridiculously good looking, super fun, almost to a point where I almost asked one of the waitresses to sit down and shoot the shit with us. Our party of about, 20 ordered a mix of things ranging from the cheese plate, to paninis, to bottles of wine to pastas, and everything I ate and drank, was super delicious. I myself didn't order any food, but I am super excited to come back and actually EAT here, hell, im excited to come back and drown myself in wine, all over again.   The only complaint I have is that there was a huge pool of water in the entrance, near, and in, the bathrooms.. I had on flip flops and wanted to projectile vomit when I stepped in whatever the hell was floating in that pool of gnarly. . I dunno what the deal was, leak? Spill? It was everywhere, and no one was cleaning it up.. other than that, I like you Bomberos.. What a pleasant surprise for a place located in Sunnyslope!!

This place rocks my socks off.  My co-workers at my new job brought me here as a welcome to the company gesture and I'm not lying when I say that I ate the best wood-fired pizza 'ive ever had in my entire life today. Not only did I try the Margherita, but then we decided it was necessary to order 2 more, pepperoni and some other mushroom thing. All of them were equally delicious, perfect crust and just the right amount of cheese and toppings. The Caesar salad, also awesome.. and how could we forget the full bar?!   The outdoor patio is absolutely divine  this time of year and the servers there are not only very friendly, but will yell at the bartender when he pours you a weak drink. I dont remember your name dude, but thank you for being the most wonderful person of the day.  I dont normally rave about pizza, and I usually only eat it when im hammered, but Humble Pie has won my heart, and I forsee many many more lunch breaks being taken here.. hammered or not.

The Big Apple has been a tradition in my family for as long as I can remember,  my mom worked there in the 70's and I think that's when it began, but when I was a kid we would always go here for get togethers, and my grandfathers birthday. To honor this tradition, my mom and sister took me here for my first, "welcome home meal" after they picked me up from the airport.   What. A. Disappointment.  Service was the slowest i've ever encountered! It was 11am on a Wednesday, and the restaurant had maybe 5 other tables full.. Our waitress took forever to greet us and take our drink order. The waitress explained the beers on tap, I went for a Fat Tire, only to find they were out, so I went for a Sam Adams, they were also out.. at this point I just asked her for something wet to sip on...  it took TWENTY minutes to get our drinks.. and we hadn't even put in our food order.. I was ready to leave. I am impatient as it is, but shit, sitting in a plane for 5 hours next to 2 5 year old put me in no mood for BS. I just wanted a beer, and I just wanted a pulled pork sandwich. My mom asked me to settle down and suck it up, so I did.   After waiting forever and ever, we finally got our food. The sister got the fried Zucchini, The mom got the Apple spiced pork loin, and I got the BBQ pulled pork. The food was just as I remembered, delicious with a good BBQ flavor. That is the only reason I am giving this place any stars, is because of this fact.   I would like to say that I will return, but certainly not to this location. There is no reason to wait almost an hour for food in an empty restaurant.

I recently lost my voice. My vocal cords have temporarily exited the building, and because of this.. I wanted some hot tea to sooth the pain from the sandpaper I apparently swallowed in my sleep Friday night. The location had been previously decided, and only wonderful things were spoken about it, so off to Cartel we go..   This joint is hidden. Had I been driving, I probably would have missed it. Also the parking situation is shit. My friend and I had to guide a 16 year old girl in her mothers boat of a vehicle, out of her parking space to avoid hitting the car that was illegally parked behind her, only to be honked and screamed at by (insert ASU douchebag here). idiots. We did get her spot though, which was directly in front of the entrance. Score. Upon entering, there are piles and piles of fliers and random magazines and also a box of what looked like dirty purses, staplers and shoes. I have no idea.. Anyway, there is radical art work and a sculpture hanging from the ceiling made of bicycle wheels, which was awesome and I want one! Plenty of unique reading material - I opted for the Best of The Onion, also lots of tables and couches full of the entire Indie population of Tempe. Most of these people happen to be Mac users, clearly shop at thrift stores, listen to the M. Ward station on Pandora and wear retro headbands, so I cant really complain. I too use a mac, love thrifting, love that station and have a sweet headband collection myself, so I don't mind this Hippie-esqe crowd. However, some people do.. If that's you, go to the corporate whore known as Starbucks instead. So basically I love the interior and the people that convent here. However, It was about 300° inside. It may have been cooler outside, and we all know how f-ing hot it is right now.. There was no way I was about to order a steaming hot tea while perspiring heavily. Annoyed, I get an iced "Happiness Blend" tea, which totally defeated the purpose of soothing my throat, but the tea was nice.. perfectly minty with a hint of daffodil. Everyone tried their hardest to have a sit down and enjoy the effects of caffeine and good company, but it was just way too hot in there, and so we were forced to leave. This situation needs to be handled immediately, otherwise there is no way I can hang out here unless its in January. That's really the only thing I have to complain about. I didn't try any of their coffees, but it smelled wonderful and the foam art that was being created was lovely.. I don't know why, but I just enjoy my beverage all the more when there is a foam heart floating on the top. Next time I'm at Eastside Records or Buffalo Exchange, I will walk over and get a coffee.. probably a Mocha and I'm actually looking forward to it too.

Patties,   What in the hell are you doing in Old Town Scottsdale? I am just really having a hard time understanding this concept, and the fact that you are hidden in between a bunch of wak ass overpriced boutiques that sell things not even my grandmother would buy is beyond me. But you know what, lets get past that for a minute.  I visited you on the day I returned from my last Houston trip. I was DD, so therefore I REALLY got a feel for what you are like like without any alterations, and even got annoyed, because there is really nothing more irritating than being tired and jet-lagged and watching everyone else get saucy while you inhale Marlboro lights to keep your shit cool. Entertaining to say the least though.. especially the part where some huge dude thought it would be a good idea to eff with the hanging space heater that I was afraid was going to fall off the wall at any second while yelling at his "bitch" to shut up and put on a sweater. Or the owner, who comes outside, sits down, lights a cigarette and doesn't take one goddamn puff of it, NOT ONE. Just lets it burn while he kicks up his feet.. I'm certainly not one to spend $7 on a pack of cigarettes I don't intend to smoke, but hey, different strokes for different folks. You have pool tables, and darts, and random ass sports and western shit hanging up everywhere.. But lets talk about the bathrooms... As a woman, sitting on a public toilet seat is one of the most repulsive things in the universe.. so you geniuses decided to install handle bars in front of us, so we can hold on while we hover.. I have never seen this before, and I appreciate it. Especially since the stalls are tiny. I will appreciate it even more when I cannot stand correctly and am falling all over the place trying not to sit on the pee infested seat next time I am there.   You have wonderful whisky, which makes me an auto-fan, full bar, and lots of beers to choose from. Your service was decent and you're not the cleanest joint in the neighborhood but dudes, I understand you're a DIVE. So thank you for being just that.   P.S. Let me remind everyone that they shouldn't enter you thinking its going to be like every other Scottsdale bar.. this my friends, is truly for those of us who don't give a shit about aesthetics and just want to drink.

Before I moved away 5 years ago, Pita Jungle was one of the last spots I HAD to have before I departed. It was always one of my favorites. As I was driving down Southern yesterday, wandering aimlessly through the city trying to find my way around again, I stumbled upon a new Pita Jungle location that wasn't here before, and, immediately flipped the car around and found the shadiest spot possible.   The decor is simple and very open, lots of windows and funky paintings on the wall. I remember the Chandler and Tempe locations being a little cluttered, but I suppose things have changed. We started with the falafel platter, which consists of 5 crispy chickpea croquettes on a bed of greens, they were cooked perfect and the flavor was great. I opted for the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap - Grilled chicken breast, tomatoes, onions, and garlic sauce, wrapped in lavosh bread and wood-fired, served with a greek salad. It was delicious, exactly as I remembered. I also had a mango-banana-pineapple smoothie, which was awesome and super refreshing on a hot day. The waitstaff were friendly and helpful and had everything out and ready within a reasonable time frame.   The fact that this place has an open kitchen totally does it for me. I love it when I am able to watch the chefs prepare my food, and see how they maneuver around their kitchen.   No complaints from me, I have and always will love Pita Jungle.

I have been to Maize's a handful of times, and have never been disappointed. However, those handful of times I was celebrating something or other and was drunk.. This past weekend, I actually went while I was coherent enough to legitimately critique and effectively review this place without having a misconstrued view on things, since often times everything appears to be amazing when you're buzzin'.  I really really enjoyed Maizes. I came with the manfriend, and once we spotted the $15 make your own mimosa deal, we were all over it. Cant beat a bottle of champagne and carafe of OJ for that price. I ordered the Classic breakfast with bacon, potatoes & eggs over medium, just the way I like it. The bacon was terrific, thick, juicy, not too fatty, also, just the way I like it and the taters were also, terrific. I have to be honest, I don't even remember what the dude ordered because I was so engrossed in my breakfast of perfection. Absolutely delicious.  Aside from the mimosa deal, they have $3 Bloody Mary's, single mimosas or tequila sunrises. Also a fabulous wine selection and tons of yummy food options to choose from. They had so much on the menu that sounded delicious, and I cannot wait to come back again to kick off some Sunday funday or even just for a quick bite.   Bravo Maizes, for turning my least favorite meal of the day into something I cant wait to come get from you again.

This place is an absolute ZOO on the weekends... I strongly suggest you come on any other day than Saturday or Sunday, you will have more attention paid to your car I promise.   Other than that, these guys do a decent job for a car wash under $15. They can be a little pushy with additional services upon arrival, but don't be fooled, you really don't need much more than the VIP at most. At most places I notice a very thick layer of Armor All on the dash, but these guys keep it light, and go into pretty good detail. The dudes that do the cleaning are super nice and will perform any touch ups that may be needed after your own inspection. A tip is also appreciated - I watched 5 people drive away without leaving anything and heard huffs and puffs from the workers, but I would be annoyed too if I were busting ass cleaning cars in 110° heat with nothing more than a minimum wage paycheck...   Anyhow, Danny's is good, I'll definitely return once my road trip is over, I know I will desperately need it!

Let me preface this review by saying I have really great friends with really great hook ups.. I had the opportunity to visit Amorone and sit in the private wine room they reserve for friends and family only. Not knowing anything about this place before coming, or even hearing its name, I was a little skept. on the authenticity.   Oh my god.  Get the mussels & clams to start, seriously, hands down, most delicious shellfish you will find in the desert.. or at least that I have found anyway. The eggplant app is also extremely delicious. I highly recommend both. For my entree I got the pork.. it was goddamn fantastic. perfectly season and cooked accompanied by the most delicious potatoes and spinich I have ever laid upon my taste buds. My friend got the Halibut, which was also, supreme.  The staff are incredible. Attentive, informative, nice and just flawless all around. I never once had to ask for a refill, or feel like I wasn't having 100% attention on me and my party the entire time, and who doesn't love tons of attention. The owner is a gem, so cool and just welcoming. I was just overall impressed with Amorone. Great wine, great service, great food, and great ambiance.   They may or may not also have a Hummer Service that *might* drive your drunk ass out to old town after dinner if you're as charming as I am.  Bon Appetit!

This review is strictly in regards to the Roof deck/Pool. Although it would be cool to stay here, to see how it stacks up the W I stayed at in NYC, but, I only came for the party.   First of all, our friends told us it would be "No problem getting in" - PFFFFFFFFFFFFT. Wrong. The bouncers we in full douchmode, and we ended up having to wait a good 15 minutes until our party inside came to retrieve us.. I was with some ridiculously good looking people too, and these m-f-ers weren't having it. In fact, at one point I asked if it was a damn gay bar because of the amount of dudes they were letting in before us. Dick to chick ratio was really off. To make things more annoying, they decided to have yet ANOTHER set of ropes and bouncers waiting for you to get up the stairs. So again. More fucking waiting. Why they do this, I have no clue, but its retarded.  Once we finally got upstairs, we were bombarded with your typical Scottsdale crowd.. Dudes grabbing at you, girls calling you a f-ing c*** and queening out for slightly bumping into them, silicone, blonde's, bros, steroids, oompa-loompa skin tones.. etc. It just reminded me why, it is, that I really dislike hanging out there. Dressing like a stripper is not my thing, so I felt a little out of place, but whatever... my Betsy Johnson dress was just fine. The only bar that accepts credit/debit is the one next to the entrance, so if you only have plastic, enjoy waiting another 15 minutes for a weak gin & tonic. The other bars up there are cash only, so be prepared.   The pool is pretty cool, equipped with windows on the bottom so people can see the action from below, and vice versa. Lots of cabanas and shit to sit on.. wouldn't mind taking a dip here someday, but its not exactly on top of my list.   I think we stayed for a whopping 30 minutes before escaping to a real bar. Although some of you may really be into this trendy type scene, it's not exactly my cup of tea. The venue itself is pretty sweet, its just the crowd that isn't doing it for me. I also hate waiting. For anything.. blame it on impatience if you will, but at 11:30pm on Saturday, I want to drink.. not sit around waiting and watching people slide in ahead.

Okay, I will preface this review by saying, I was extremely hammered when I came here, so the level of awesomeness I remember may or may have not been altered by that fact. Either way, I REALLY liked this spot.  I got cozy at the bar with my guest under the funky blue lighting and soon after was joined by the Executive chef, Johnny Chu. What a wonderful wonderful man. He spent a decent amount of time chatting with us, which was cool. He really is a prime example of why I absolutely adore chefs. The only thing I tried food wise was the Wasabi Tofu, which was really good, but watch out, the first bite is REALLY hot, in every way. Excellent drink selection, but like I said, I had already had enough.. thus I am looking forward to revisiting Sens in a more sober state, very very soon!

So good. Oh so good. So good for a hangover, or, so good for brunch with mom. Quaint little establishment with cute little waitresses bouncing around in tiny little shorts. My coffee cup was never empty, and even as I was leaving, my waitress was filling up my to-go coffee cup..  she gets my vote for the most wonderful person of the day. Their breakfast menu was pretty excellent, I got the Western scramble with mushrooms and it was cheesy delicious excellence. Very clean, and lots of seating.. I had read about the lines, but we got right in and right out. This place is exactly like The Good Egg.. but not as many senior citizens or bonnet wearing geese used as the decor.. I am a fan.

What a cool spot! Came here the other night for a drink and was pleasantly surprised that a place that used to be a clothing store could be turned into such a charming lounge. Feeling a little adventurous, and because I freakin' LOVE Brazilians, I opted for the Capiriana.. Fortunately, the bartender did not disappoint because these can be hit or miss. It even came with a sugar stick lolly-pop, pink I may add, so that was pretty neat. Feeling the munchies come on, I ordered the snack plate, which came with a variety of sliced meats and cheeses, along with pistachios, bread & olives.. perfect for sharing too! The interior is huge, and very open.. I love that the bar is situated directly in the middle too, friendly bartenders and tons of seating. . Unfortunately I didn't venture to the bathroom, which is supposed to be a site to see.. maybe next time.

I ventured here again this past Saturday night, to crash a date of all things.. Date crashing was a success, as well as the 2 other things I needed to check off my Hanny's to-do list.. A.) Try the Cauliflower & B.) Use the bathroom.   A.) Cauliflower is so f'ing under-rated. Esp. when you come up with a genius idea to pair it with bell peppers, onion, mushroom, red pepper flakes and ONION STRINGS, are you joking me..?! This shit was delicious! Totally try it. Next time I promised myself I would try the asparagus with egg.. anything topped with a fried egg has to be pretty money.. so, that is now on my to-do list, and I can't wait.   B.) Bathrooms are a TRIP. Lets put it this way... Have you ever played Kingdom Hearts and gone into the widget room that looks like a crazy maze (yes, here comes the nerd in me), or watched Alice in Wonderland while on psychedelic drugs (okay, me neither but I can imagine its comparable).. mirrors, everywhere, colors, lights, vacant elevator shafts with glass bottoms, unmarked doors, which I can only assume used to be dressing rooms at one point considering Hanny's used to be a clothing store, only one sign that says "men", so ladies, don't even worry about it.. just walk in any one of the doors and you're in toilet heaven, I say that because every one of the rooms I went in was CLEAN.. and I went in a few because I have a bladder the size of a 3 year olds. I could also see some of the surrounding corridors being a wonderful place for a generic drunken photo shoot.. (or maybe this has already happened.. I'll never tell).  OK enough about the bathrooms, but they are just THAT cool.  I like this place even more than I did before. Service was as excellent as the last time and plenty of cozy seating to accommodate the group I was with... For some reason it gives me the feel of something I would discover in Manhattan, or the South End of Beantown. This place is truly a DT gem.

I stopped in here on a "Welcome back to Phoenix, time to try new bars" tour. . . and was instantly a fan.   First impression ~ Great vibe. Dimly lit, white pleather booths, trippy artwork, great indie music, funky light fixtures, excellent drink menu & CARTOONS on the tv's.. Seriously, any bar with cartoons will immediately win my heart. The exposed brick and hardwood floors were a nice touch giving it a more upscale feel. We sat at the bar, which is where my only complaint will come in.. the bar "stools" were extremely awkward and uncomfortable.. I ended up standing most of the time because my ass was not fitting in the oddly shaped groove. Whatever, its just a bar stool. My friends and I had to try the Absinthe, which, when prepared correctly (which it was) is always a good time. They also carry bubblegum vodka, which is possibly the most delicious thing I have ever put in my mouth! I was told there was a smoking patio, but instead it was more of a smokers staircase.. but I cant really complain about it because it had a decent view and nobody caters to nicotine feens anymore. There weren't too many people there so our bartender was super attentive which was rad. This place is great for groups, and dates alike.. very intimate feel in those dark little corners :o)

I'm bumping them up to 5 starts because I have probably been back half a dozen times since my last review, and have never been disappointed. It has absolutely become one of my favorite bars for 3 reasons..  A.) I once took a nap on the corner couch, and no one cared. B.) They leave out my favorite lifesavers mints in the bathroom. C.) Absinthe and Black & White movies with dancing midgets from the 60's playing.  Order the White Rabbit and see what happens to you. #mouthgasm

Allow me to be an asshole for a moment while I write this terrible review. Maybe its because it was Monday, and raining.. maybe it was because I was in the mood for Humble Pie and not Mexican grill.. maybe its because restaurants in Arizona don't have the freshest sea food in the United States of America, whatever it was, I hated this place.   I have this habit of asking my server what their favorite thing on the menu is.. and usually I go with it. I am adventurous, I like surprises.. So homegirl suggested the nachos or the Seared Ahi tacos.. so what do I do? I ordered a taco plate. Since I like variety, I mixed and matched and went with a fish & pork taco with black beans. The Ahi tasted wicked old and nasty fishy. I almost spit it out, but I am a lady and that is rude. The pork was very undercooked.. I don't know about you, but I have absolutely no interest in catching Trichinosis. I can think of better ways to spend my day than with nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, and abdominal discomfort.. sorry those are not things I am interested in, thanks anyway though. Beans were served cold and I swear the rice they served was something out a box from the dollar store. My dog could make better rice than that. There was shit floating in my water and the limes I asked for were so dried out that not one drop of juice came out. Seriously? Cut up some fresh ones.. its the little things that count.   Service was slow, but the chick was nice enough. One of the girls I went with knew one of the managers, who was supposed to hook us up with an employee discount, but conveniently forgot about us at the end.. but what are you gonna do, nothing is free anymore.   I dunno, I just wasn't impressed. The only thing I dug about this joint were the tiles on the wall.. and im certainly not going to return to a place to stare at a wall.   next!

The Pho Tai was perfect. I actually got it to go, and I loved how every component was in its own packaging and totally fresh. I also got an order of spring rolls which were delicious and refreshing, just like they should be. While I waited I sipped on some lovely house jasmine tea, and almost stole the teapot because I wanted ever last drop of it in my body. Place was close to empty and really quiet and my order was out within 7 minutes which is SUPER. Waitstaff were nice and apparently super excited I was there, that or some PhoNazi smeared vaseline all over their teeth to keep them smiling. I am wicked excited I found this joint. I love Pho & Vietnamese cuisine in general and its close to work. I found a new lunch spot. Merry Christmas to me.

Each and every single memory I have of OTT is fuzzy. If there is ever a plan to come here, I know im leaving completely hammered, along with everyone else.. And what better place in Old Town to do so? Aside from Patty's, this place is my second choice.  Its small, and cozy.. nice little patio too where they have bands play on the weekends, and occasionally you'll find some funky indie folk artist playing inside, which I dig. There's even a fireplace outside for those chilly desert nights. The bar inside is cool and the bartenders there definitely know how to pour a drink.. The bathrooms are clean, but watch out, the locks on the doors are selective.. I was once poppin' a squat and this drunk cougar walked in and started washing her hands and staring at me.. mind you this is a single bathroom.. It was bizarre, and I'm pretty modest, but I realized she was tanked so I let it slide.   They have an roof-deck type thing upstairs, also with a fireplace, but its wicked small, and usually packed. Ive maybe spent a total of 2 minutes up there, but if you get there in time, its a pretty sweet spot for people watching.   All in all this place is pretty chill. I love coming here, especially during the day, so if anyone is in the mood for a little day drinking in Old Town, call a bitch.

I'd just like to thank Andrew K. for introducing me to this gem. You are a wonderful wonderful man because dudes, this place is delicious. Strawberries, Gorgonzola & candied pecans on fresh greens - hell yes. Perfect pizza crust that is crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside covered with delicious fresh toppings. Cozy seating AND a full bar. This place is pizza perfection and you need to go here immediately. The mouthgasm is totally worth the drive.

Worst Pasta I have ever eaten. I'm not even kidding.   We ordered the Fried Buffalo Mozzarella, Pork Shoulder & Calamari to start .. all of it aside from the Pork was blah and unimpressive, the Pork was tasty, but the flavor was REALLY strong and I couldn't eat much of it before wanting to vomit.  For our entrees we got the Orecchiette alla Puttanesca($15)... which apparently has 12 random ingredients from some streetwalkers pantry and last time I checked, a streetwalker is a hooker, so, I mean, if you're cool with eating shit from a hookers pantry, order this, its not good.   We also got the Fettuccini Tagliatta($19)... rib-eye was a little tough, noodles tasted funky and me and my palate were overall just very disinterested in eating more than 2 bites. Also, id like to add that both entrees were not hot, like they had been sitting there for a while. This irritates me to no end.  Not only was the meal sub-par, but its was freakin' expensive! Honestly id rather bust open a package of Safeway brand angel hair and Prego from a can - it tastes better anyway.  Sorry PastaBar, never again.

Everyone loves a round ass. A little junk in the trunk is awesome, and wonderful and if I were a dude you would definitely ping me as an ass man. If your wondering why my ass is getting rounder, Mojo is your answer.. and worth every assrounding calorie I might add!  Mojo on Mill is literally, a 23 second walk from my office, and this my fellow Yelpers, is one of the most wonderful things in the universe. I come here, secretly, at least 2 times a week. Usually more.   I love the cleanliness of this place most of all. The fact that over 200+ grubby sweaty college students and corporate whores alike can stumble in from the dirty streets of Tempe all day long and not have a smudge or single drip of yogurt on the floor is spectacular. They always have my favorite flavors, which are always the fruity ones, Pomegranate especially, and they always have my favorite toppings, which are also, always the fruity ones. I'm not just talking Maraschino cherries in sugary syrup or canned Pineapple, i'm talking freshly cut strawberries, just picked blackberries and blueberries and raspberries that will send your taste buds into a frenzy. F-ing Delicious.   The kids that work here are little smiling dream boats, that never fail to brighten my mood, and the selection is just, perfect.. no one is left out, vegans, lactose intolerants, dieters, fatasses.. there is something for everyone. They also do the secret word of the day on Twitter, for 50% off your purchase, and how badassical is that?  I love you Mojo, not just because you provide me with a tasty little get-a-way from work, but everything about you.. especially what you are doing to my ass.

I'd say its pretty safe to say that I freakin' love this place. Came here with my man-friend the other day for lunch, and my only complaint is that they don't serve the brunch menu on the weekdays... Something to look forward to on the weekends though, because it is goddamn delicious. Not only is this place great for breakfast, lunch, dinner or HH.. its also got a decent selection of wines for sale, AND wine on tap.. are you kidding me? Love it.  To accompany our Mimosas, because it was a champagne kind of day, we shared the prosciutto & brie panini along with their famous bruschetta  - you get to choose 4 kinds per order so we did the brie & apple with cheese spread, prosciutto with figs & marscapone, smoked salmon with pesto and the roasted pepper with goat cheese.. ahhhmazinzazing! All of them. F-ing mouthwateringly delicious. Certainly try a few if you happen to visit.   Their drink deals are ridiculous.. $5 glasses of wine or $5 pitchers of beer from 11-5pm, Monday and Tuesday its $20 for a bottle of wine and plate of bruschetta , and you get $9 off any bottle if you take it to go. They have a a groovy back patio that is wonderful for anytime of year since they bust out the heat lamps, 1 per table it seemed, plenty of parking and pristine bathrooms. I like the minimalistic decor.. and the fact that it was very light and airy.. literally the place was packed about 15 minutes after we sat down, and I never felt claustrophobic like I do so very often.   Everything about this place makes me smile. Its just GOOD. Go here as soon as you can, I promise you wont regret it.

One thing I am wicked excited about now that I am home is all the Fro Yo around here. I love this stuff and the east coast does not have many options for frozen treats, since well, its only hot for about 3 months, maybe, and its not as trendy as it is out here, naturally.   So I stumbled upon Mojo last night.. fn fyeah! I like trying a little of everything so I mixed the Tart Pomegranate, Skinny Strawberry and White Boy Vanilla flavors, topped them off with rainbow jimmy's, gummy bears, fresh strawberries and bits of cheesecake, weird, but f-ing awesome. I was a little bummed that they were out of blueberries and a few other fresh fruit options, but I got there 20 minutes before closing so I can't expect it to be fully stocked at the time.  I really dug the whole peace love & happiness vibe going on and it's pretty much perfect for anyone with their non-dairy and low fat options as well. Mojo is awesome, and certainly beats out any JP Licks or Berryline in Bean Town.. totally going back.

Open, bright and clean are what come to mind first.. extremely friendly staff and plenty of parking were a huge plus! I wish I hadn't eaten 5 of my moms homemade tacos before I ventured here. Their menu had so many delicious options! First of all, I never thought to douse corn on the cob with cheese and paprika and I'm kind of pissed it took this long to find a place that has because, omfg it's the most amazingly delicious simple culinary treat. This is what I started with and I seriously could have eaten a whole maze of it. TRY IT. Next came the veggie torta, which I shared. I could marry that bread. So fluffy and yummy and the veggies had a wonderful flavor too. . At this point I had reached stomach capacity, so onto the bourbon! They did had some interesting drink options, but I was just in the mood for the usual. I am excited to go back and try more dishes, which have gotten rave reviews, then possibly take a plunge in the Clarendon pool which is apparently open to the public! Free towels & lotions included. Score!

Here are a list of things I have tried and loved since my first visit here:  ~White Sangria - loaded with tons of fruit, just like I like it. ~ Huevos Rancheros - despite the fact that the first one they brought out had runny egg whites,  they took it back and prepared my meal correctly, and I was pleased. ~Chilaquiles Verdes - I liked this best of all the dishes I tried at #smunch. ~Elote Callejero- ie: smothered corn.. You cant not love it.. its just too good. ~Margaritas - one of the best i've had in town! They are strong!  Here are a list of things that I hated:  ~Pineapple Picoso - it had muddled red pepper in it too, which was a disgusting combo that I hated and do not recommend to anyone. ~Cantaloupe Spiked Water thing... Chad S. loved it, I think it's not so good. ~ $7 guacamole..  my plate of breakfast was cheaper than that!  Anyway, I dig this place, for the most part.

This place holds a lot of sweet sweet memories for me.. first dates, second dates, fun bags, binge drinking after my car got broken into, St. Patty's day pre-gaming.. I love Local Breeze, allow me to count the ways..  Its like this.. You walk in, and BAM, you're immediately on vacation. The atmosphere is so super chill, and quite frankly one of the most random places I've ever been to. Fantastic (enormous) patio with cozy chairs next to fire-pits, tiki torches, bag pits, waitresses that seem to constantly be stoned, an owner who tells me that I have a beautiful head, decent breakfast and also a great dinner. Last night we had the filet Mignon and the biggest Caesar salad Ive ever seen in my entire life. I'm not kidding, there was literally 5 pounds of salad on my plate, it was shocking.. I could have fed that psycho Octomoms entire family with my leftovers.   Ive had several things here and have never been bummed.. the hummus plate is the jam, a mound of delicious crispy pitas, 3 different types and all of them equally delicious. Burgers are juicy and huge and fn' BOMB. Breakfast is tasty, but slightly overpriced in my book. Full bar included, and who doesn't love that? On top of it all, the parking situation doesn't completely suck.. lots of street parking is available in all directions.  Only complaint is this.. one morning I came here and wanted this crazy alcoholic coffee concoction my buddy told me about, its basically 10% coffee and 90% booze.. 4 different kinds of booze, and rather than granting my wish, she told me I was crazy and that the drink would cost roughly $30 because of all the different shots that are in it.. are you effing kidding me? If I EVER pay $30 for a drink it better be some decent Whiskey or there better be gold dust and muscle relaxers flying out of it. Okay, that's a little extreme..  but seriously, I'm not gonna pay that. Now that I really think about it, everything there is a little over priced, but the people and atmosphere totally make up for it.  Anyway, I heart Local Breeze, and i'm totally looking forward to making many more memories here. Check it out!

This place is pretty fantastic. I actually felt like I was in a real life city when I was sitting here the other day on my laptop looking out the window. I sorely miss living in a real life city, specifically Boston, so places like this make me super happy.   Staff are really cool and helpful. Its spacious and clean, and I don't feel like everyone in the place can see my screen, not that there is anything weird on there... okay there probably is, but bottom line is no one else is staring over my shoulder making me feel self conscious about shit I enjoy looking at on the internet.   The coffee is delicious and strong. Nothing worse than a weak cup'o joe. I had a pot of their Orange Detox also, which wasn't terrible, but I could tell they used tap water.. I loathe tap water and can immediately tell a difference because I think the tap here tastes absolutely fucking disgusting. I still drank it though, because the chick promised me it would help me feel better.. Guess what, I sneezed all night.   O'well.  Another thing I liked about this place is that there aren't 500 hipsters or emo-assholes sitting around looking depressed.. maybe I was lucky that day because it wasn't very crowded at all. So yeah, I dug Lola, and the prices are CHEAP. Thankfully this is yet another groovy coffee shop in the valley that is there to help me avoid the Corporate Whore that is Starbucks.

A colleague of mine dropped her business card in a drawing here and won a party for 100 of her friends. This included $1 drinks all night, which is freakin' fantastic, so naturally, I'm totally in. Now, given that it is Halloween time, we all decided to wear our costumes.. even thought we were the only group to do so, it was perfect, and all eyes were on us, and who doesn't love attention?. $1 drinks + dueling pianos + costumes = a pretty excellent combination of awesome.   The venue itself is pretty big, plenty of seating to watch the live entertainment. Attentive bar tenders, and decent looking food, which I did not try, but should have, to absorb the copious amounts of chocolate cake shots and Kiltlifter I slaughtered. The entertainment was amazing. I myself am a huge fan of piano bars, and the musicians there certainly did not disappoint. They rocked it..  called people up to the stage to participate which is always funny, and the perfect way to get the crowd going. When I say crowd, I mean army. Of drunk. This place was packed and I loved it! I even loved the hostess everyone thought was a giant vagina because she complimented me on my hair and gave me 2 extra drink tickets. She was not a V. She was awesome.  Anyway, Arrive early if you like sitting down, or you could just dress up as Tinkerbells hot redheaded tattooed sister, and half the room will offer to give up their seats for you. See, chivalry is not totally dead. Not here at least.

Holy Crap. These people are the most wonderful human beings of the week. I literally do not have anything bad to say about the magnificent body-workers of Triad Chiropractic. These people are saving my comfort, one vertebrae at a time.  I came in here today for my first visit to aid in the repair of my neck which was traumatized in my accident. I have never been a fan of Chiropractors, its always seemed like just a quick fix with no long term results, in my experience anyhow, but Triad is not just Chiropractic care, they are so much more. I went in, was given the undivided attention of Dr. Baca, who is an angel sent from above, for about an hour, where we went over everything from my family history to the events of my accident. From there he examined me and gave his prognosis, and then the treatments began. They do everything from Spinal adjustments to x-rays to Prolotherapy to Physical Therapy to ultrasounds. Its pretty much the one stop shop for auto injuries because not only do they do everything in their power to help you and make you feel better, but they also serve as a liaison between you and the insurance company you are dealing with. Its amazing. They even recommended me to the perfect accident injury lawyer and discussed with me all the possibilities with my case.  Its rare that I rave about anything to do with doctors.. I usually hate them all, but not here. I am actually wicked excited for my upcoming visits and finally feeling some relief.   Seriously, even if you were not in an accident.. go here. Whether its for Headaches, Carpal Tunnel, Tendinitis, Sciatica, Chronic neck/back pain, etc.. they will fix you!

In the former Lisa G. spot (RIP my love) TMI is now what you will find, and apparently I am the only person in the universe who isnt madly in love with it.  I came here a few weeks ago for dinner/drinks with the boy since he had heard from a co-worker that their menu was pretty delicious, and more specifically that their mac n cheese was to die for.. Well let me tell you what, I had it, and it's not that great. At least on this particular night, I was definitely not impressed. It was loaded with peppers that completely overpowered any other flavor that may have been there. The boy had one of their *awesome* grilled cheeses, which again, wasn't something i would rave about, mostly because it was so unmemorable and basic, plus I kinda hate it when a place serves mainly lunch options for dinner. I like sandwiches as much as the next guy, but not for dinner. However, they do have a decent drink menu, lots of beers, wine & even liquor, so whatever your alcoholic heart desires, you will find it here..  Our service was a mess, I think we had 3 different waiters asking us the same questions over and over, then forgetting and asking them again. I don't care if the place was packed, get it together dudes.  The interior was classy & cute, but also a zoo.. So packed that I couldn't even get to the bathroom, people running into our table as they walked by and at one point I watched our waiter stand for 3 whole minutes, plates in hand, waiting for people to get the hell out of the way so he could drop them on our table. Maybe I am just impatient.. Anyway I realize this place is new, so there's definitely hype, but over all, I was just really disappointed in what I had hoped would be a close match to its previous occupant.   I will give it another shot, but I'm in no rush.

The owner greeted me at my car door with a giant umbrella to escort me inside the restaurant while it was raining...  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!   Georgie S. wasn't kidding when she said this place is a fantastic establishment. Its totally in a shitty strip mall and from the outside looks like an old greasy diner, but let me tell you friends, looks can certainly be deceiving, and in this instance, they totally 100% completely are.   I visited last Sunday on the rainiest day in the universe. The first thing I saw when I walked in was a bowl of Jelly Bellys, and if you know anything about me, you know I love me some jelly beans. Spoon full for me, Handful for you. We asked for a booth, so they quickly got one ready and seated us, all the while shooting the shit and laughing with us about something or other.   They have this whole New York theme going which made me happy reminiscing on my days living in the city. Sports memorabilia, license plates, photos and everything else you can think of that represents The Empire State were hanging or scattered around. The menu is out of this world. $3 mimosa's & BM's.. full bar, everything from Hot Dogs to Breakfast Burritos to Turkey Subs to Philly cheese steaks and so on and so on.. a little piece of everything you'd find from a street vendor in NYC.. and that by no means is a shot at their food. New York City vendors sell some of the most delicious culinary creations in the universe.   Our waiter was super attentive and of course, I asked him what his favorite thing was. Bam. The Philly Cheese Steak, so I order one. This bitch of a sandwich was HUGE. It was like a Philly Cheese mountain, and holy cheesy steaky mushroomy oniony Batman it was delicious. Georgie S. was clearly being a fat kid that day and proceeded to order 4 things. Chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, a hot dog and, dammit, I don't remember the last thing. The Canadian went with the most boring thing on menu and got bacon and eggs.. But what does he know? Canada is useful only to provide me with furs and I don't even wear that shit anyway, so I guess that means its really good for nothing. (just kidding. (not really)). Everything was tasty and perfect for the hangovers we were all battling.   This place is nothing fancy and is certainly not crap. I loved everything about it from start to finish, including the bill, which was about $40 for 3 people including 2 drinks each. Not bad Gino's. Not bad at all. See you soon, rain or shine!

I love burgers. I've said it once, and ill say it again, my last meal on earth would absolutely be a burger. It will be juicy and meaty, the bun will be dry and toasty and there will be more pickles than you can count.. It will be accompanied by a mound of delicious french fries and a giant milkshake... Today at lunch, I was invited to try a new burger joint, which apparently everyone loves, and was told that my love affair with In&Out would be shattered.. Well, that was a lie.   I got a cheese burger, fries and a cherry coke. The sheer fact that there is fountain cherry coke automatically merits a star. I liked the options I got for toppings, I chose mayo, pickles, sauteed mushrooms, lettuce and A-1..  I've got to admit, I was excited, really excited.. however, that excitement was quickly shattered when I got my meal.. I unwrapped the tin foil, hoping to find a delicious juicy cheeseburger, just for me.. yeah well, I found a burger, just for me, but it was WET. The entire bun was drenched.. THIS, ladies and gents, this disgusts me to no end. One of the words I hate most in the world is moist, and I also hate when things that are not supposed to be moist, are moist. Especially bread. BARF. The meat wasn't very flavorful either.. and they used portobello mushrooms, that were cold. I frowned. My lunch date frowned back. The fries were apparently from Shelly Idaho, I know this because they have a "Todays fries are from.." board.. they taste just like In&Outs, just thicker.. so basically it is imperative that you order them well done.  The place is big, holds a lot of people and they are really well staffed, but the meal was just meh.. and for the two of us the total came out to be $22.00. TWENTY TWO DOLLARS for 2 cheeseburgers, fries and a drink.. for real??   Whatever, i know its inevitable that I will give this place another shot, mostly because I work next door, and Fat Burger doesn't do it for me.. But I was just really really sad with the whole experience. I don't eat burgers often, so when I do its a treat, and well, this was not a treat.   *sigh*
