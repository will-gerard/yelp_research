Snapdragon is probably the best salon I have ever been to in my life and I'm not exaggerating. I got my hair done by Jordana who was amazing and really saved my hair from a mess of highlights and damage. I was previously convinced that I needed to get highlights but Jordana was able to bring me to the dark side and I am so glad I did because it's so much better over here :). When the color and cut were complete I hardly recognized myself. It looked so much better and made me wonder what the heck I was thinking with those highlights .I can honestly say that I will never go blonde again thanks to Jordana's amazing talent and education on what hair color looks best with my skin tone and eye color. She really took her time to perfect my color and style which was so needed. I am seriously in love with this color and this salon. Not only was Jordana wonderful but all the staff at Snapdragon are so friendly and professional. They are attentive to your needs and create a fun and comfortable atmosphere.  I will definitely be going back to Miss Jordana for my next visit since my husband also commented on how much he liked my hair as well. Thank you so much Jordana for fixing the highlighter hell that was on top of my head. You are very talented and I am so very happy with my new style. I will be sending more clients your way for sure. :)

I was not impressed by this place. The service was terrible. The hostess couldn't even smile when she seated us. Even though we went in during the lunch rush, it was not that busy but nobody came to our table for a good ten minutes.  When she finally came to the table she was talking so fast that I felt rushed. I asked her a question about an item on the menu and she thought that was my order and almost walked away. I had to tell her to slow down and answer my question. After she finally let us have a few more minutes to look at the menu she kept calling me honey which was awkward.  Overall the food was ok but with the crappy service and rushed atmosphere I don't think I would go back.  I wasn't able to order the lunch combo because they wouldn't substitute the chicken for veggies.

They have the most unhappy employees that I have ever seen in my life. The restaurant was filthy and I couldn't find a clean table to sit at. After asking a cashier to clean one nobody came over so I cleaned one myself with a napkin. Meanwhile I noticed 5 employees sitting down chatting in the restaurant and watching me clean the table. Management needs to make their employees have pride in their job because everyone is miserable. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I can see I'm not the first one to have felt that way.

Well I had a consultation appointment scheduled today and they didn't even show up. What kind of service could they provide if they can't even show up? This business is laughable in my eyes. Never again.

I love PCA. I decided to send my son here after a bad experience at another local daycare. The staff here are really great and do an awesome job at getting to know you and your family. They make you feel welcome and make your child feel safe and secure. My son loves his teacher and wakes up everyday with so much excitement to go to school. Some days I pick him up and he doesn't want to leave! I love community engagement the school has. I'm very happy with my choice to send my son here. PCA has been a great blessing to my family.

Great service and rapid repair. They came to our house and fixed all 3 iPhone screens within about 30 mins. Quick and easy transaction. I would definitely use them again. Thank you!
