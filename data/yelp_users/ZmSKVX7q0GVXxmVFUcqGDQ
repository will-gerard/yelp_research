To your left you'll see a rock that looks like a dinosaur and to your right you'll see a rock that looks like a person.  Sometimes you'll see some real animals, but not today...    Really? Is that all you've got.  Maybe we just didn't luck out, but our tour guide was horrible.  Not witty, not funny, not even that interesting.  He was clearly reading from a script because at one point he lost his place or got confused or something and ended up re-reciting the entire opening three minutes, word for word.  Most of the time he just but on a soundtrack, which clearly was way too short for the entire 90 minute tour since we listened to the Titanic song 4 times.  As a side note, you may not want to remind people of a huge boat accident when we're doing a boat tour... but that's just me.    Definitely something for the older crowd, but even they seemed restless after about 45 minutes.

If you come here for dinner on a weekend, prepare to wait.  This place is popular, and deservedly so.    They told us the wait would be 30 minutes, and it was 30 minutes.  Honesty, plus 1.  The service was super friendly and everyone seemed to remember our names, another plus 1.  The food came out very promptly and with no problems, plus 1.    We ordered the corn bread, which was HUGE (enough to share with four people) and came with some onions and jalapenos.  Warm and good (if you like what's inside).  Then we split their rotisserie chicken and their pork ribs.  I'm not a huge fan of pork, or of ribs, but these pork ribs were absolutely delicious.  They slid off the bone with no problem, and they were just the right amount of sweet and with very little fat.  The chicken was also pretty good, but I found it a bit dry.  It would have deserved 5 stars if the chicken was a bit more juicy and if they had a larger menu.  As it was, the menu was a bit limited.

One lookat a picture of their signature burger and fries and its clear that they have completely copied Father's Office (Burger joint in Los Angeles). The problem with copying FO is that their legions of fans have no choice but to make the comparison.  So, I'm not reviewing this just as a burger, but as a FO wannabe. And as a wannabe, it falls well short of the mark.   First, although they seem to have gotten the ingredients right, the bun is too thick, the patty too thin and dry, and the toppings less flavorful. The regular fries are limp and bland, the sweet potato fries are better, but too thin. The sauce (they serve ketchup and some sort of aioli) doesn't hold a candle to FO's signature aioli.   The rest of Delux's menu is unnecessarily huge and for some reason they also serve sushi. Who wants sushi from a burger place or burgers from a sushi place?  Better to do one thing right than 2 things badly.   The ambiance isn't much better. The restaurant is located in a Safeway strip-mall. They have an indoor area mostly made up of community tables and a cramped outdoor area overlooking a parking lot with misters spraying the patrons. For some reason they decided to give it a club-like atmosphere with blue lights shining down on the badly prepared food and simultaneously made it family friendly by letting children of all ages eat there. The result is a hodgepodge of burgers, beers, parked cars, raw fish, and crying children.   All in all, a poor imitation.

I hated this place.  $22 for a crappy cup with a bunch of slush and no alcohol?  What a waste.

Awesome bar in an incredible neighborhood. The live music was great, the beers were unique, the house eclectic. If I lived here this would definitely be a regular.

As others have noted, it's not a fair, it's a carnival.  I've always imagined State Fairs to be where people from the actual State get together and show off their produce, have pie contents, biggest pig, biggest tomato, talent contest, etc...  This is a bunch of private creepy carnival companies coming to town and milking you for everything you're worth.  The games are stupid.  They're designed for you to lose, but so you don't feel bad, if you pay enough, most will guarantee a stuffed toy.  I'm sorry, if I want a guaranteed stuffed animal, I'll go to the store and pay market value for it.    Then they have their tricky ticket system, $5 get you 10 tickets, $20 gets you 40. So there's no benefit to buying bulk.  Each game is 7-10 tickets, and it's usually for only one try.  So you're literally paying $5 to try to throw a single ball into a random basket.  But you feel better because it's tickets instead of money, so you do it.   The photo booths don't work, but they refuse to put "out of order" signs on them.  So we spent 20 minutes on a bunch of different booths that didn't work before getting our money back and leaving.    The food is probably the worst part.  Not only is it ridiculous prices, but it's also not food any more.  Fried burritos, fried burgers, fried ANYTHING.  There are places where you can't take a breath without getting a lung-full of fried.    The only good part was the Ferris wheel

This place gets packed for lunch, and rightfully so.  Delicious sandwiches that are absolutely huge.  Can easily be shared with two people.  I think I got the Rachel, which is pastrami with thousand island dressing and coleslaw (I think).  Anyway, it was huge.  I ate half of it and it was plenty for me.    Make sure to come early or have some time because the lines get a little long.

We were looking for sushi and super hungry.  This is the first place we saw on our drive, so we pulled over.  It was pretty much empty, I think one other customer at the bar... which is usually a bad sign, but we decided to go for it anyway.    Clearly based on the menu and the interior, this is a take-out or delivery place (do they deliver?).  But we decided to eat in.    Got a bunch of the regular rolls. California, Rainbow, Tuna, Shrimp, etc...  Service, almost non-existent.  We had to walk over to give them our orders.  They brought the food.  We walked over to pay.   The food itself was surprisingly pretty good.  Maybe we were hungry and maybe my expectations were pretty low, but it actually surprised me.  Everything was fresh.  The fish was cut pretty thin.  The sushi didn't fall apart and everything was proportionally right on.  I probably wouldn't come back here to eat-in, but for take-out or delivery this place would definitely be a winner.

First, it's on St. Denis street, who clearly was the BEST of all the Saints.  So they get 5 stars for location.   Came here for an early dinner, around 6:30.  No problem getting in.   By 7:30 it was packed, so make sure to make reservations!   The service was more efficient than polite.  Nothing to make you feel unwanted, but nothing to give you that friendly feeling either.  However, it was very quick and prompt.  It could have been because our table was reserved for 8:15 (which they told us twice) and they wanted to get rid of us quick, but the service was very fast.  Which is a huge plus.   The complimentary bread was absolutely delicious.  Not warm, but super fresh.  I got the steak and fries, which I now realize is my usual order at a french place.  The steak was pretty good, the fries were golden and crispy, really good.  For dessert I got a lemon tart (though it was called something else in french).  Not the regular watered down taste, super lemony, so I was a huge fan!   The ambiance is nothing special, especially for the price.  Everything is plain, nothing is particularly clean, though it's not dirty either.  The tables have white papers on them...  At first glance it could be a deli with a bar.

I absolutely loved this place! Easily my favorite restaurant in my trip so far.  And since is my last dinner in Canada, the best dinner of the   Unfortunetaly we came too early for the live jazz (which starts at 7:30) but they were still playing recorded jazz over there speakers, and that definitely set a great mood.   First the service.  I've noticed that in Quebec there is a certain snootiness.  Maybe they are trying too hard to imitate the French, even in their negative traits, but it definitely exists. But not here.  The waiter was super friendly, very fast and really helped the night flow smoothly.   As an appetizer we go the brie baked in something, then with some nuts, some sauce and some pears.  Ok, i'm not describing it well at all, but it was awesome!  For the main course I got the Greek-style lamb. It came with some vegetables, including this beat puree, and freshly made potato chips.  The lamb was absolutely delicious.  I tried a different lamb dish, that also was delicious.  If you come here, get the lamb.    For dessert we tried the creme brulee.  I completely agree with Leighann F. This was not the best creme brulee I've had.  Not even in the top twenty.  The sugar was too thick and the creme was too clumpy.  I'm told that means they cooked it for too long.  The taste was fine, but the texture was just off.   However, I also got the blueberry tea, which it turns out doesn't have any blueberries in it, but is made of Grand Marnier, Amaretto and hot Orange pekoe tea.  It gets its name because it smells and even tastes amazingly like blueberries.  Definitely something I'm going to ask for in the future!   Overall, amazing experience.  Good for a date or a nice evening out.

Came here for lunch while on the way to the museum.  Service, was very confusing.  They told us to have a seat and that they'd get to us.  We waited about 10 minutes, then realized no one was coming.  We ended up going back to the counter and ordering there.   While at the counter we saw all the delicious little pastries and cookies they have.  Couldn't resist and got a couple nut filled dates, nut filled apricots, marzipans and Turkish delight.  I also ordered the chocolate delight tea.   The tea and cookies came out way before our paninis, so we scarfed them up as appetizers.  The pastries were good, but the date and apricots concoctions I could easily have made myself (in fact I have) so probably not worth it.  The tea was not chocolaty at all, maybe a mild something chocolate, but barely noticeable.  Good, but not great.   Then came out the panini.  I got the turkey with cheese, pesto and grilled zucchini.  The zucchini was sort of lumped in one place, so what was pretty weird.  The pesto seemed non-existant.  The sandwich was ok, but pretty bland.  Nothing worth getting again.    Overall, based on my review it sounds more like a three.  Not sure why, but I really liked the atmosphere. Probably wouldn't come back here for sandwiches, but a great place for casual meetup with friends over tea and cookies (if that's your thing).

Came here for drinks/snacks on A Friday around noon. The place was dark and had way too much empty space.   We had a group of 8 so we ordered the party platter - which is a ridiculous amount of food for $40. Everything was way too greasy, while the meat was ironically pretty dry.   I also got the margarita, which came in a huge fishbowl-sized glass and was plenty strong. So come for the drinks, get food elsewhere.

Came here for the lunch combo, which is a lamb gyro with fries and a drink all for like $7 (I can't remember the actual price, but that's about right).  The fries were crispy on the outside, somewhat flaky on the inside, and neither fat nor skinny, right in-between.  The gyro was in a warm pita with a BUNCH of delicious lamb, some tomatoes, and a good helping of their tzatziki.  I love tzatziki, and this was pretty good, but it could have been a bit more cucumbery for my taste.   Cheap HUGE delicious meal.  Definitely great for lunch!

I actually do love burgers and I did not love this place.  Hate would be a strong word... but strong dislike is absolutely on the mark.    I got their bacon burger, which was supposed to have an overload of bacon, but didn't.  I ordered the burger "medium rare" which is how I usually get it, but for some reason got it raw instead.  It was so undercooked that it didn't fully warm in the middle.  I took a couple bites and feared that if I continued I would feel sick.  So I stopped.  We also got some Parmesan garlic fries and sweet potato fries, both of which were pretty limp and disappointing.  Even if the burger was cooked ok, it would still have been overpriced and underwhelming.  Plenty of good food spots in Vegas, this is not one of them.

Great little breakfast/brunch place with cool chairs and ropes hanging from the ceilings.  We got the Pain Perdu with sausage and a coconut macaroon.  I thought the main dish was a bit too thick and heavy, though my girlfriend liked it.  Neither of us thought much of the sausages. The macaroon was fine, but felt a bit under-cooked.

For an airport restaurant, this place was surprisingly good. Nice selection of beers, and several items on the menu that immediately caught my attention.   I finally settled and the tuna tartare with avocado. It was fresh, well-balanced, and came with enough chips (which, for some reason, is a rarity with this dish at other restaurants). It did have more onions than I would have preferred, but when eaten with everything else, I didn't even notice.   Maybe the best part is that at the front they have a plate or chocolate chip cookies with fat salt crystals. The cookies were free and had no strings attached, which is rare (especially in an airport) and a very nice surprise.   The only reason this place gets 4 stars is the price. I get that it's in the airport, but it was absurdly overpriced.
