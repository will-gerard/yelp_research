I've ordered from this location for a couple years now, they never disappoint. The one time they made a mistake, they went out of their way to fix it for me! Drivers are quick and polite!

We had problems with the office. They seem very unorganized. We made several service calls because of things that needed fixing in the apartment, and we would have to call 3-4 times before they sent someone. They sometime even blew it off completely! We also had issues with conservice WAY over billing our water and sewage, the office acknowledged the problem and reassured us not to worry about it and just pay the normal amount. Yet, now, I'm moved out and I get an astronomical bill saying I owe them for that. This is just to name a few problem that occurred while renting from them.   As for the apartments themselves, the shower was embarrassing. Literally painted on. The interior amenities were very cheap. Fake wood floors, and the wall implements such as the towels racks fell out, our entire breakfast bar counter fell off at one point, very old washer and dryer that broke soon after moving in. The cabinet doors would frequently come off. I just think for what we paid, things like that should be of a higher quality. Our apartment got unusually hot most of the time, too.   I WOULD NOT recommend this place. They need to get it together. They're a nightmare to rent from. Never again.

I work right in the area, therefore it is my go to lunch spot. The customer service at this location is incredible. I cannot recall a time where I have had an unpleasant experience. It is a busy place to go, but they're quick and efficient. The whole dining experience is pleasant. They have outside seating as well which is nice during the cooler parts of the year. The thing that stood out to me however, is that during Mother's Day, they greeted every mother and handed them a goody bag which contained a fresh loaf of bread with a little note. I appreciate when a business goes above and beyond for their guests. The only things negative about their location is the parking, which can be chaotic, but that is no fault of theirs. I will continue to go here and recommend to all! Thanks for the great service, Wildflower!

Smiles from the moment we walked in, great energy from the employees, AMAZING food. I wasn't able to catch the name of our waitress, but she was delightful. Very sweet and personable. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated with a laid back feel. A bit of a drive from me, but it is very worth it!

Nice place to hangout with friends and enjoy a cup o' coffee. They have good pastries as well. The baristas are nice and laid back.

This is an awesome place. All gluten free, vegan friendly, organic, healthy, healthy stuff! The pizza is DELICIOUS! We've been coming here for years and it's fantastic every time. We had Nick as our server last and he was so personable and friendly! He was on it! It is a little pricier, however, you're definitely getting what you pay for in the quality of the food. Great location in the Promenade plaza!

I LOVE their sushi here. It is by far the best in town. I'm not kidding, I've tried many sushi places throughout Scottsdale and this is my favorite. From the Chimmy to the Damn Good, they have some of the best specialty rolls. The calamari is amazing. I could go on and on about their food, the point is, it's delicious. It's a laid back type restaurant/bar with good drinks too.  The servers aren't exactly the nicest, that's my only problem with this place. When you spend a decent amount of money on food, you would expect the customer service to be a little better. They're kind of just indifferent to you all together.    I would still recommend this place, however. Just try to improve the overall customer service and I think you guys will nail it!

This is an beautiful place to learn yoga. I had Will as my instructor for the Hatha Flow and he was wonderful. He made it easy to follow and allowed us to modify the moves as needed. The gong at the end of the class was a nice touch as well!  The yoga studio was fairly large and had huge Windows that overlooked a little lake with a fountain. They have lockers and provide you with yoga material if you don't have any going in.   The entire facility is beautifully decorated, I could come just to oooh and ahhh over their decor! I will most definitely be returning!

What a great place. It's such a cool concept. You pick your seats when buying the tickets, sit down, press a little red button and a server promptly comes over to take your food and drink order. The customer service is always fantastic, really nice and fun servers. The seats are comfortable and they have retractable trays to eat your food on. It's a great date night idea for an even better price. Movie tickets are about that of a regular theatre and same with the price of food. I love coming here during the week when it's slower, the weekends can be pretty busy, as expected. I always order my tickets and seats in advance online. It makes the process a little bit easier and assures that we get our desirable seats.

I'm sad to write this review, but I do it in hopes that management can improve on some ongoing issues I have noticed as a consistent customer. While the sushi is okay, the customer service and overall dining experience is lacking. It seems that they are almost always understaffed, causing the few people who are working to have to run around and tend to 40+ customers frantically. It all seems very unorganized. There are times where it will take us 15 minutes to even get our beverages served to us. Not only that, but once you get your drink, you never see them again. They're too busy, which is a good thing in theory, but they're not properly prepared. The servers aren't very friendly at all anymore. All this has just ruined Teharu for me, we used to come everyday too, which is a shame.

Teresa did an awesome job, she is very thorough. Her technique is like no other, she uses a roller to assure that it is even throughout. She is mobile which is super helpful! She has great prices as well. The product that she uses are amazing for the skin and smells so yummy. I would definitely recommend her to anyone looking to get a great spray tan.

I come here for their lunch special which is $12.99 for all you can eat. This continues to be a favorite for me because the price and the overall quality of the food. It's not buffet style which definitely classes it up. It really is a beautiful place, actually. Not cheap like you might expect. The bathrooms are incredible. I might sound crazy, but just see for yourself. They have a large variety of food to order from and they always serve it so quickly! Go in with an empty stomach, you'll definitely want to make room for everything! The Volcano roll is really neat and delicious, too! Keep it up!
