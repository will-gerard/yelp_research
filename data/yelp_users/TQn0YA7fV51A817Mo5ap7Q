The drinks are definitely below the standard set by the location in San Gabriel. The milk green tea I had wasn't flavorful enough and the sugar didn't help make it any more appealing.  The service was even poorer than I expected for an Asian establishment. At this point, I'd rather go to the Volcano Tea a few blocks down in hopes of finding something better, and I never thought I would ever resort to that.

Another mediocre sushi place.  It was pretty crowded when we went, so we had to split into two parties to make seating easlier.  Everything I had there was just... okay. I didn't really expect anything that great, since we were pretty far inland and in the Nevada desert.  You da ma too! (spicy tuna w/ salmon and spicy mayo) - underwhelming Salmon nigiri - not fresh Alaskan salmon roll - pretty skimpy  Points for having unusual (sometimes suggestive) names for special rolls.

The wait was luckily very short, but the price was still outrageous. Almost $40 for a buffet? Better be the best damn buffet in the world.  Sadly, that it was not. The king crab legs that everyone kept lining up for were cold and tasteless, the prime rib that night was just... meat, and the desserts were pretty generic. The only dish I really enjoyed was the veal scallopini.   Maybe I've been spoiled by all the Yelp adventuring I've done this past year, where I go to restaurants that specialize in specific cuisines/dishes. But for such an expensive restaurant (of such high repute), I expected better.  Next time, I'm trying the Bellagio.

BEST restaurant in Vegas. It's cheap, it's delicious, and it's open 24 hours. It's amazing even when you're sober--now that's a real treat.  My favorite was the Caribbean Jerk, I had to go back twice for it. My friends also enjoyed the Oiriginal 1762 and the Earl's Club.  If you're in Vegas, you MUST MUST MUST come here.

I forgot how expensive food in Vegas can be until I looked at this place's menu.   When you're serving average Chinese food (a shade better than Panda Express) and each dish is around $20 a pop, you know you're in Vegas.  The only reason we justified eating here was because a relative had it comp'ed.

The only thing cool about this place is the 2 free egg rolls for each check-in you do on Yelp.  Otherwise, it's mediocre Viet food. The pho broth was not very flavorful, and the toppings were not that good either. They were pretty understaffed, seeing how they didn't clear some tables for about 30 minutes while they worked on getting new customers food.

Much hype for the chocolate man. Although I'm not a big chocolate person, I figured... I was in Vegas! I'll give it a shot.  Because I was unwilling to spend too much money for the food, I chose to get 2 small sliders. I don't remember what they were, but they were just generic sliders. Nothing spectacular.  I tried the waffle smothered in chocolate and chocolate bits and ice cream. Syrup Desserts in DTLA is way, way better. All I tasted was chocolate, but no real flavor. The waffle was... bland and lacking.

What a wonderful find while waiting in Sky Harbor Airport during a layover!  They have a great variety of beans and prep options that I would normally only see at a standalone coffee boutique in the city, and they're so well-priced! It was only $2.75 for a delicious cold brew!   Highly recommend if you have some extra time in the Phoenix airport.
