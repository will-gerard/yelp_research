We went to Orange table for breakfast. This place is wonderful the food is great and the service was top notch. It was a little hard to find not being from Scottsdale but the gps got us really close and then we just asked some nice ladies and the pointed us right to it. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations from the menu. The place was busy and our food was prepared quickly and our drinks never went empty.  We will definitely be going back again for breakfast next time we are in Scottsdale.

I booked this resort through Priceline like so many other reviewers. I had seen this resort from Scottsdale road many times and always thought I would like to stay there sometime. Now I am so glad I finally got the chance. We stayed for 2 nights over memorial day weekend. Upon check in I was asked if I would like to up grade to a king suite for $20 more a night. I said sounds good to me. I figured it couldn't hurt for as cheep as I got the room through Priceline. I cant say enough about how well we were treated at this resort. Some of the other reviews said that this resort didn't have a resort feel. In my experience nothing could be further from the truth. I was treated better here than I have been at many 5 star resorts that I have stayed at in the past. Our suite was part of a 4 plex of suites and while the decor was a little dated it was very plush and comfortable in every way from the couches to the king size bed. The bathroom was very clean as was the entire room. The ground around the entire resort were impeccable. There are either 4 or 5 pools through out the resort and the main pool has a small waterfall. The jacuzzi tubs were all very warm and in working order. We didn't order room service but I did browse through the menu and the prices were really reasonable. Everyone we met that worked at the resort was extremely friendly with the exception of one bartender at the poolside cabana bar. Overall I would have rated the entire experience with 5 stars the reason I gave it only 4 stars is because of our experience at the poolside cabana. On Saturday afternoon we walked down to the poolside bar area to have a drink and we sat at a table near the bar. We were ignored by the bartender for over 15 minutes while he talked to some young girl in a bikini who was already done getting her drinks. When we were finally acknowledged we asked him if he knew how to make a certain drink he quickly replied no what else do you want in a very rude manner. We each ordered some Orange drink that was on special and it was terrible. So I am taking a half star for that experience and a half star for the extremely high price of wi-fi. It would have cost nearly $13.00 a day so we decided to pass. Thank God for our smart phones. Overall we really loved our weekend at this resort and would definitely return  especially for the great price we got through Priceline although I never did get a chance to see a regular room and I wonder if our experience would have been as good if we hadn't upgraded to the suite.

We went here with a large group for a birthday party and the service was pretty good but the food left a lot to be desired. It was edible but far from good. My raviolis tasted like chef boyarde raviolis from a can, which I happen to like but not for the price they were charging.

I was surprised at how good the food was here. I wasn't expecting it to be so good. Prices really aren't to bad at lunch time either. Try the lobster roll its amazing and light yet filling.

Had lunch here today It was great, the food was great We had the Appetizer Trio, Pasta Mardi Gras, and the Mixed Seafood Grill. It was way more food than the two of us could eat. The server was very attentive and very helpful. I would recommend Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen to anyone who likes Cajun food or Seafood there is so much to choose from and basically the server said we could change anything on the menu to have it made just the way we wanted. AWESOME

Love this place. I was always a fan of YC's. This place is kind of the same concept with way better ingredients to add to your bowl. Not only does it seem much fresher there is a lot more to choose from. The drinks are also really good with some long pours.

Love In-N-Out for what it is. It has made fast food even faster by simplifying its menu and streamlining service. It's always packed with people but you still get your food fast. Plus I really love the fact that there packaging and cups have scripture printed on them.

They have really good fish tacos and they use to have a blackened mahi mahi that was amazing they changed that to another type of mahi mahi that is still pretty good but I miss the old style.

Pretty good Cajun seafood. Small area with mostly counter seating. The restaurant is open to the casino. I would probably eat there again if I happened to be at the casino but I wouldn't make a special trip to go there.

Really good barbeque and a nice atmosphere sometimes the music can be a little to loud for conversation. We usually go with another couple and order the big tray of food it comes on a garbage can lid and the platter for 2 is big enough for 4 with food left over.

Let me start by saying I never have written a review on yelp but after eating at Posidon I just felt I had too. This place is absolutely wonderful the food is excellent and the service is better than most 5 star restaurants. We had the humus, spanakopita, the gyro plate, and the souvlaki, as well as the free pita chips with tzatziki they start you out with. Everything was beyond our expectations. We even ordered a bag of the pita bread to take home with us. Prices are really great most plates are under $10 most appetizers are below $5 and the portions are huge. If you haven't ate at Posidon you are missing out. My new favorite restaurant.

We had a great breakfast here. It is set up in a fast food fashion but the food is way better than you will ever find at any fast food place. Lots of college kids flock into this place so you know the foods great and the prices are right.

Distrito all I am really gonna say is that as good as the food was there is no way that it could ever make up for how terrible the service was. We went for brunch on Sunday and after we were seated I checked in on Yelp and was given a free guacamole appetizer for checking in. I was happy about that and unfortunately that would be the last good thing that happened at this place. Let me say that while we were there it was not busy at all. First we ordered our drinks I had a coke and she had the bottomless bloody mary. Then I ordered the free guacamole thanks to Yelp. For our plates I ordered the skillet and she ordered the pazole verde. The waiter brought back our drinks and that was the last time we seen him until he brought our bill. Someone else brought out our plates about a half hour after we ordered  but we hadn't received our guacamole yet. We asked him if he could get us another bloody mary and he left never to be seen again. We had to actually go inside and find someone to get a refill for my coke and the bloody mary. Then we asked about the guacamole again and they finally brought it out when we were done eating. Overall I enjoyed the food but the service was so terrible I would never go back.

Drinks are amazing with long pours. Ask about the secret gummy rings. They are great. The ones we were given were soaked in vodka for 5 weeks and they were huge. Loved this place.

Of course the beef wellington was amazing... it goes without saying. The service was pretty good and attentive. The food is very expensive of course and there are far better places to eat in Las Vegas for the prices they are charging in here. I guess thats to be expected though after all Gordon Ramsay is a Super Star ... LOL

WOW! We heard there was a new Fox restaurant concept that was focused on seafood and we had to make the trip to go check it out. It was 100% worth the almost 2 hour drive. This place is a little hard to find but it is in the same area as another fox restaurant called culinary dropout in Phoenix. It offers valet service and I would suggest you use it because any other parking is hard to find. Upon arrival we were almost immediately greeted by the General Manager Blake, what a awesome guy. He thanked us for coming all the way down from Globe and he made our dining experience extraordinary.   Overall everything we tried was excellent. We had 2 appetizers one was a blue crab toast and the other was a warm jar of buttered crab, both were out of this world good. For entrees we ordered the Cajun shrimp, the bouillabaisse, and the fish and chips. All three were excellent. The Cajun shrimp has a good amount of spice and the fish and chips, for being fried, was very light and flaky.    I would highly recommend trying Little Cloe's Seafood Legend. This is definitely our new favorite seafood place in the Valley. Everything is flown in fresh daily and you can tell.

Love this spot they hand make your vape juice right in front of you. Nice menu with a huge selection. If you like fruit flavored vape juices try the Mother's Love. It is my new favorite.

We had a great time at the Saguaro. We stayed from August 24th until August 26th. Our room was awesome 2 flat screen tv's a huge bathroom with a super deep tub and separate shower area. The bed was so comfortable, although the pillow were a little thick for my liking. The staff was super friendly and they really made our stay wonderful. The pool is really cool and when you go under water you can hear music, nice touch. Last but definitely not least Distrito was great especially the drinks that Jay was serving up. We will go back just to drink some more of Jay's creations. They were absolutely unreal and out of this world.
