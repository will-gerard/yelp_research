This resturant is so close to being great. Fantastic coffee, wonderful food, live entertainment in the evenings on Friday and Saturday but the service is horrible! I have had to leave twice because I could not get a coffee order in after 10 minutes with no people ordering drinks in front of me. I did enjoy the personal conversations of the 3 employees that held on personal conversations with eachother for that entire time and did not even acknowledge me. I have come into the resturant and sat down two times now and have not been acknowledged for over 20 minutes and the employees walk back and forth from the kitchen to the front of the resturant to the coffee area. I don't get it. I had to go to the front and ask if I had a server or how do I order both times and both times they say that I guess I could order with them. Really? Where do I order? How do I order? Do I have a server? I  keep coming back because the food and coffee are great hoping the service with get better but yet again I am disappointed.
