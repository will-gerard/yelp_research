I really tried. I've been here multiple times over the past 4 years of living in the neighborhood. But, yet again, customer service has driven me away. A few years ago, the manager steered me in the wrong direction which led to my purchase of $100 of chemicals that went down the drain, and then admitted his wrong doing in the subsequent visit after I confronted him, but only after I confronted him. He made it right by providing more chemicals on the house after some reluctance...This was 2 years ago.  On a more recent visit, I encountered a young lady. She was very nice, chatting with the people in front of me for 15 minutes while I waited in line to have my water tested. She did not acknowledge my presence and continued to chit chat with them. Granted, I was the only other person in the store, so I brushed it off. She then proceeded to have an attitude with me like I had done something wrong. Today, this young lady was working again, and again, was helping another customer..perfectly happy go lucky. When it became my turn to check out, I requested a price match to leslies.com for some shock as it was a few bucks cheaper. She then proceeded to tell me the SKU was different and that she could not. Now I understand this is a corporate policy, but it's the same exact product. And I wasn't asking for a 50% discount, it was $3. Seriously? At that point, she picked up an attitude with me. Same type of attitude she had the previous time. As a customer, I felt disrespected with her general attitude and lack of understanding. I could care less about the $3. I will not be returning to this Leslie's. I'll take my money to another Leslies or to NPS.

I like this Home Depot.   There's a few great things about it. 1. It's next to my house 2. It's never that busy 3. People there are usually pretty knowledgeable (When you can find someone in the department)  I had an especially good experience there last night. I had called to check the price on a vacuum that I had seen online that was marked down. I called to double check price and they transferred me to the flooring department. The associate repeated back to me the item and quoted me the wrong price. I chalked it up to online vs. store pricing. But, my inquisitiveness got the best of me and I headed in. I double checked the price in person. I was right! The item had been marked down and the associate hadn't actually checked in the system.   Long story short, I had to buy the item "online" and pickup in store to get the price I wanted and it was just about closing time. The manager Mark walked me throug the process and helped me out a ton by ensuring I got what I needed while I was there and even kept the store open for a few extra minutes for me. Gold stars for Mark.

Actually received a referral from Unique to Dentless Images because Brad works in the east valley.. Brad just left my work and was able to fix one dent completely and minimize one dent by about 50%. Brad was honest, fair and best of all, he communicated! Let me know when he was about an hour away and when he got here. Communicated and provided a fair quote a few days prior over text.  I would have left this review on Brad's page, but I couldn't find one on yelp!  Thanks for the referral Unique!

Wow. Am I reading the reviews right? Are we even going to the same place? Went a few weeks ago to this joint on a Thursday night, and the place was dead. Football was on and there was 2 guys waiting for to go food. Not a bad sign that the food was decent. Girlfriend had the pulled chicken, and I had the tri-tip.  Both sandwiches were severely lacking in any and every way. To be honest, didn't even taste like BBQ. No smoky flavor, and the food wasn't even really hot. Meat was not tender and it just seemed like a poor attempt at BBQ. I tasted both meats without the "BBQ" sauces and they both were lacking in flavor.  I even tried a staple, the Mac and cheese as a side. This had absolutely NO FLAVOR. It seemed like they melted a few slices of value brand cheese on top of some macaroni shells. I couldn't even eat it. The pulled chicken was so bad that my girlfriend took a few bites and couldn't eat it.  As far as their sauces, they were extremely watery and didn't have a good taste to them.  For what it's worth, I have worked in restaurants for over 5 years and in the restaurant industry for over 10. Currently I work at a corporate office for a restaurant chain, so I don't want to say I'm an expert or anything, but I have a decent idea of what food is supposed to be and when something lacks in flavor.  To be honest, it feels like this place seemed like it should be featured on "Restaurant Impossible". The decor is a mish-mosh of oddball photos, pictures, knick knacks and dust. Not that I was expecting that much from a restaurant in this complex. Hell, I don't care that much as long as you have good food.  A perfect example is Mrs. White's Golden Rule. (Seriously awesome southern food downtown thats a real hole in the wall). You'd figure at the least this place would have a soda machine...but no. We decided water was the best option. They did have a water cooler that you'd find in an office that distributed water, but we both thought that was kind of odd. (Does that even pass food code?)  All in all, I don't think I'll be trying this place again in the near future. This is really disappointing since I live within walking distance. My girlfriend won't even walk foot into this place.

First of all, let me preface this with a disclaimer. My girlfriend and I were hungry and couldn't decide on what to eat and as the hours moved on, we finally decided on Bueno Burger due to it's proximity to my house. Not double checking the closing time, we walked in 15 minutes prior to close.  From experience in the restaurant industry, I know that walking into a restaurant 15 minutes before close, you're asking for it. Bad service, leftover food etc. But regardless, we were hungry and this was a much better option than Subway.  We decided to take it to go to try and let the staff get out of there, but we didn't feel too bad as there were about 5 people in the restaurant already.  Food:  I had the glendale burger on wheat and my girlfriend had the carne asada burrito. The burger was decent, a little on the dry side but had decent flavor. The burrito on the other hand was lacking flavor and the rice was undercooked and was still hard/chewy.   Ambiance: We walked in and there were a few people waiting for food and a few waiting for food. The big TV is nice while you're waiting. However, after we had ordered, two teenagers walked in, one with a guitar. I didn't think anything of it, but as soon as they ordered, the guy with the guitar started to play and the girl that was with him started to sing....badly. They sat down in the dining area and proceeded to sing the whole time we were there waiting for our food...a little over 10 minutes. While they were jamming out to old Pocohontas (yes disney) tunes, my girlfriend and I were starting to get annoyed but we decided to keep quiet as we were getting out of there soon. The place was nearly empty but these kids were playing like it was a street corner...inside. The staff proceeded to do nothing about it and it appeared like they knew them and the two were regulars (greeting by name etc). I surely hope this is not a nightly thing.   Overall Experience: For the 15 or so minutes we were there, the first impression was not a good one. The staff seemed unexperienced (our food sat in the window for several minutes before being packaged up and given to us - resulting in luke warm food) and the two kids singing and playing guitar could have been charming had the music been decent or if the girl had a voice that wasn't like nails on a chalkboard. Not everyone wants to hear your terrible rendition of "Blue Corn Moon"...you just insulted Vanessa Williams to the nth degree.  Granted, it was 15 minutes before close when we walked in, but the restaurant and staff should be operating at full capacity till the business hours say they're closed. Since the restaurant is so close, maybe I'll give it another try during more normal hours...

I'm not one to usually speak up, but I've had it with this location. If not for the convenience factor, I'd never visit this place. To reiterate Lisa C.'s point, they mess up...a lot. Nearly every order I've made there, they have seemed to screw up. Forgetting cheese, wrong order, cold food, long waits. I kid you not, I waited 15 minutes in the drive through the other morning for a cup of coffee. I understand that you're busy, but 15 minutes? Seriously? The staff is untrained, unprofessional and clueless when it comes to making anything "fast". This morning, I ordered 2 frosted doughnuts and a turkey egg-white flatbread. The doughnuts were thrown in a paper bag (leaving frosting all over the inside of the bag) with no liner and the turkey flatbread took an additional 5 minutes after we had paid to receive (and it had a cold piece of cheese on top and not melted as it should be). The gentleman at the drive thru did express that he was "sorry" that it was taking a long time, however the flatbread was in clear view for a portion of those 5 minutes, clearly visible from our car. We finally spoke up and he explained that he was very busy and promptly handed us the flatbread, when in fact there was no customer in sight and 2 cars behind us that had arrived 5 minutes after we had ordered. I've been to this location several times over the past year, and I don't think I can handle going back.  I sincerely hope the proprietor of this location reads this and realizes that this whole staff is untrained and uninformed about anything to do with customer service, speed and accuracy. I've received better accuracy and customer service at a Taco Bell.  Please retrain your staff and get with the program. Maybe I'll try in another few months, but for now, I'll make the 20 minute drive to get my DD fix.

I contacted Bryan a few weeks back to get a quote on replacing the resin in my water softener as the water pressure in my house dropped and the resin bed was due for a change. Without even knowing my name, Brian was on the phone with me for 20 minutes explaining the ins and outs of the softener system and the reason for the drop in water pressure. After calling a few other places, I realized that Brian not only had the most complete explanation, but also had the most competitive price to replace the resin.   I had to schedule about a week out since he was booked up, but he arrived as promised and quickly went to work. He was extremely nice and chit chatted with me on and off during his few hours at my house. There were a few unforseen problems that he addressed with me and came up with a solution that would work for both of us. His company name stayed true to it's word "Integrity" and after all was said and done, kept to his quoted price even though the job turned out to be a bit longer and messier than originally anticipated.  Bryan communicated throughout the entire service and kept me informed of what was going on, and stayed until the job was done (it was dark by then!).  Don't hesitate to call Bryan.

Was referred to this restaurant by a friend who raved about it.  We went in a few weeks ago on a Sunday and the place was just starting to fill up.  Wife loved the decor and it was quaint in a cool french cafe kind of way.  Had the egg sandwich on a croissant. Was absolutely delicious.  Served with a small size salad and some hash browns, it was a lot more food than I was expecting.  Wipe had the eggs Benedict, and they were good as well served with the same salad and hash browns.  Croissants were amazing.  Only tried the butter,  but they had chocolate and another flavor or two which I can't recall right now.   Word to the wise: get there early to get croissants as when we were there,  they sold out.  Also, it looks like it pays to know the owner and be a regular. Witnessed a customer come in, order croissants to go, followed by a regular who knew the owner and ordered those same croissants.  Since there was only a limited amount,  the person who had ordered to go and had already paid was denied half his order and the reasoning was someone had "reserved" the croissants before.  Sounds a little shady to me.  Service could have been a bit quicker as we sat there for a good 5 minutes waiting to be served,  and then another 15 minutes waiting for our dishes to be cleared and for the bill.   Will be back!

Love grassroots,  so decided to try out twisted grove. Was disappointed to say the least.  Started with brussel sprouts, and they were delicious.  Others at my table complained they were burnt,  but I thought they were just crispy enough.   Main courses  were marginal at best.  Wife ordered the short ribs and gnocchi. Gnocchi was good,  but short ribs were lacking flavor. I had the roasted chicken with stuffing and grits. Stuffing was delicious,  but chicken left a lot to be desired.  Portion was very healthy,  but one piece of the chichen was extremely dry. This was not a one off as another person at the table ordered the chicken and had the same problem.  He also ordered a side grilled cheese sandwich at the servers recommendation,  which he prompted was the best part of his meal (@$3). His wife had the crab cakes, and as other reviewers have said,  were delicious (disclaimer: I didn't try) -and these were one of the most expensive dishes at $29. My dining companion did mention to the server that the chicken was dry and didn't eat it and the server responded "did you want me to tell someone about it? ", to which my companion responded "I just thought that you should know". And for full disclosure,  I did eat all of my chicken as I was starving,  and I don't typically complain unless the food was atrocious.  In this case,  just not good.  It would have been nice to at least get a manager table touch,  or been offered an apology for our mediocre meals. Considering we spent around $200 last night on dinner (with booze), you'd think the manager would at least come check on the table.   Dissappointing. From now on,  we'll stick to grassroots.
