Overpriced and microwaved.  Eat more than 10 feet away from the game and enjoy a meal.

Twice in a row the person cutting my prosciutto has pressed it together into a ball of meat. Basically ruined. It's one of 3 items I bought and I treated its bag like a carton of eggs. This is not the location to splurge on pricy cuts. Lame.

Everyone is so friendly here! Can't say the same of the lady who works at Bell and 35th. Everyone at this location was kind and helpful.

So we went from 3 stars to 2.  NOT for the food.  The food is good.  The service??!?!?!?!?!?!!  We ordered lunch, and food was forgotten.  Crap happens, I understand that, so I immediately call.  The manager said he would refund the card we paid with for the cost of the food forgotten. (chicken on a salad).  So.....not make it right and bring the chicken?  So now my friend has some iceberg lettuce for lunch?  But **free** iceberg lettuce.  I asked "that's what we do?"  And yes, that's what they do.  I remarked that I needed to get off the phone so I could go order her lunch and they said "ok".  OK. I just would have expected our order to be delivered in full..eventually.  But not at all?

So good!! Very friendly staff and patrons. Everyone always seems to be a regular when you go in there. I've had their plain cheese and also a pepperoni with sausage. My New Yorker boyfriend gave his seal of approval by eating almost the whole pizza lol. We'll be ordering again for sure! Call ahead for take out. They are great, so it's busy.

The food was just alright. Really great happy hour specials for drinks. ****BEWARE**** for our party of 4 (not 8 or 10) they added automatic gratuity. The fast and not thorough explanation given to my boyfriend was "yeah..we already add on gratuity". Ok...where is that posted? Is that legal? Gratuity is an incentive. Don't get me wrong, I tip, but I don't like being forced into something. I actually tip more than their forced tip charge. Just doesn't sit right with me when that isn't made clear. ****Seems deceitful.****

We usually really like Claim Jumper but we always go to the one in Tempe.  MUCH better customer service in Tempe.  Not impressed.

I want to love this place.  Really, I do.  It would be a perfect restaurant for one of those "please update our business for us" 911 renovation shows.  The dusty fake plants and ultra old decor don't support the more expensive menu.  The dancing was cool but VERY LOUD.  We had to yell to talk to each other, there were only 4 of us.  The paella is good, but if we order wine and tapas and a paella to share and the bill is pretty substantial...I would love for it to be in a place where I don't have to yell and doesn't look like a 24 hour burrito shop in south Phoenix inside.  Our waiter pushed an appetizer on us because we mentioned we were pretty hungry and the paella "takes a while".  He didn't mention that they bring out complementary bread.  There was also a random employee, maybe a busboy?, kind of standing behind a post across from us just watching.  Maybe he gets into trouble for not immediately filling up waters or taking plates?  I don't know.. but it was kind of creepy.

Such a great spot. Very friendly staff. Awesome chef. Chilean sea bass and crab fried rice were a hit, even with my 4 year old niece. Fresh fruit and coconut sorbet for dessert were perfect. Will definitely be coming back.

HOLLY is great. That should be said. Honestly, one of the best experiences at a check out. And that's a weird thing to review, but isn't that a lot of your grocery shopping experience? It is. I liked her so much I felt obligated to say something. Thanks Holly.

We should have read these reviews! THEY LIE.  Watch out.  We dropped off a package there 7 days ago and it has never been sent to actual UPS to be shipped.  We called UPS and they informed us that if they had picked it up, it would have been scanned and the tracking would reflect that.  This store lost our package and never gave it to the driver when he comes to pick up their packages.  The owner, the grump everyone talks about, told me "WELL THIS IS WHY THERE IS INSURANCE ON PACKAGES!"  Are you serious?  I wasn't rude when I called, this guy just starts yelling and is crazy defensive.  Probably because they literally have problems with every transaction.  DO NOT GO HERE.  AVOID IF AT ALL POSSIBLE.

Everything I've tried is amazing. The owner remembered me the 2nd time in. Super friendly and awesome lemonade with rose water. Def worth trying.

If you want some delicious pupusas, this is your first stop. Decently priced and yummy. My boyfriend and I tried the shrimp, steak, pork, and black bean. All good. Grab a green corn tamale for dessert. They are just sweet enough.   Favs: shrimp pupusas & green corn tamale

HUGE customer service fail today. I called ahead and made an appt for a mani/pedi. I showed up 10 min early and signed in, also indicating a mani/pedi would be desired. The girl who gave me the pedicure left for the day after painting my toes. They had me wait 30 min. All the while people walking in and getting in line. They then asked me to pay. I explained I had an appt for both and he claimed I didn't. I also explained that when I arrived 2 hours before their closing I marked I wanted both. Not even an apology. They let the people who walked in an HOUR after me stay.  I can't believe they didn't even apologize if it was truly a misunderstanding. Also, if you have us check off a list what we want? READ IT. There are 8 other nail places within blocks. You don't have a monopoly on the market. Customer service goes far.

My order was $10.23. Give the guy $15. He hands me back the $5 and tells me to come up with 23¢. I asked if he didn't have changed and he just gave me a confused look. Ok?... Also, did you guys run out of sauerkraut for the Rubens? Just give a person a heads up. (PS- I know I'm being ridiculous writing a yelp review on a fast food restaurant but "come up with 23¢" is aggressive lol. Really? It was like 845p and what's your deal bro.

I purchased a car here in December of 2012.  I, constantly, am harassed by phone and email to trade this car in.  Last summer I asked to be taken off lists as I had traded the car in for a Honda from another dealership.  Nope.  Not taken off the lists.  I ask to be removed from emails and will get a confirmation.  Nope.  Still not taken off the lists.  Every time I explain to the sales person calling me that I am not interested, that I won't be buying a new car for a very long time and that I don't even have the Nissan anymore, they act like they are "so sorry" and "i'll mark down that information."  That obviously isn't happening.  Are these spiteful calls?  Have I wronged this company for buying a car from a competitor?  Why am I being lied to and harassed?  Because that's what it is.  I have seriously contemplated changing my phone number because I can't stand the thought of receiving another phone call.  The last one I received was at 12:47 pm today.  ***I would seriously think twice before buying a car here because you will be forever on a calling list.***

Great ambiance, great staff, great food. Their happy hour is great and the sourdough bread is the best. I love sitting at the oyster bar, especially when Mark is working. Try the señorita roll or the crab Louie salad. Can't go wrong! Pictured is the Bluewater Roll. Perfection.

Salon De Cheveux is always friendly and the stylists have talent.  My hair has always looked amazing.  Kassi is amazing with color and knowing exactly how i'm trying to describe what i want with my hair.  I live in east tempe and drive to goodyear because of the trust I have with this salon.

We used a Living Social deal and the staff was really nice.  It was just a hot day and seemed really humid inside.  The wheat beer we tried was pretty good and I'm not normally a fan of those.  The other beers on tap just didn't agree with my taste buds.  I can see other reviews where everyone loved the porter, wish that had been us.

Always great beer to choose from and the food is great.  I love the flat breads.  So yummy.  Hit or miss on the wings.  The first time we had them, they were AMAZING.  The 2nd and 3rd time? Meh.  Wish those would be consistent.  But overall..super great place to hang out.

Its what you expect for sushi ranging from $1-$5.  Its a fun experience for sure.  The service was pretty good up until the end of our meal.  We went for lunch on a Sunday.  We were literally the only patrons in there and had each grabbed 3-4 plates and a drink.  Our waitress came to the table to ask if we needed anything else and we let her know we were OK, just picking off the plates and chatting.  Maybe 5 minutes later a teenage busboy came to our table and very rudely asked "is there a problem?".  What?! LOL.  OK bro.  It was pretty clear he wanted us to leave.  Again...we weren't sitting there for 2 hours.  It was maybe 10 minutes after we finished eating and still had a little food on our plates.  THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE IN THE RESTAURANT.  I wouldn't make an effort to come back.  Its not the kind of place you can hang out and enjoy yourself.

I pop in for a bagel probably 2-3 times a month and the staff is very friendly and fast.  They remember you and smile.  The bagels are way better than Einstein's.

Great hangout spot.  I've been pleased with everything I've ever ordered but my fav is the freshly made chicken chorizo nachos.  So yummy.  They always have great beer on tap and a pitcher is $5 during happy hour (good stuff, not just coor's light).  The banana churro dessert is ridiculous in a good way.  Always great service. HAPPY HOUR ALL DAY IF YOU RIDE YOUR BIKE.

Carne Asada Torta was delish! I was nervous because I had read some bad reviews on the service. Our waitress was a peach and everyone that I came into contact with had a warm smile for me. Great food, great service. Def coming back.

I wanted to love this place, really.  The service was HORRENDOUS.  The wait staff isn't trained or they seriously just didn't give a crap about getting fired.  Either way..not awesome.  We were given an attitude about asking for a glass to accompany a beer in a bottle.  The waitress, with 'tude, said they don't give glasses because "that's not how its done in Asia."  Oh really?  Tell me more super white 21 year old girl from Phoenix lol.  We didn't ask for an explanation, we just asked for a glass.  Having to order vegetables a la carte is aggressive.  That's super cheap guys.  We brought a friend who lived in Singapore and lived on hot pot cuisine.  He gave it a "eh...not really".  I have to take his word for it.  It's the bad service that will keep me from coming back.

I grew up going to this place when they were located at 19th and Dunlap.  SO HAPPY to find out that they opened up again!  Sweet & Hot Shrimp was great.  Super speedy service for take out.

The food is great for what you'd expect from a little place on the side of the road off 7th street. Food alone would be 4 stars. Love the sign. Just KNOW going in that even if you order and wait it'll be a wait. We were told 30 min. As he told us that I saw a car pull in with the restaurants logo on the side and saw they made deliveries. Great!, or so I thought. We paid upfront and opted to have the food delivered "in about 30 min". Over an hour later it arrived. I guess this is still really fast compared to some of the other reviews. We ordered the Family Dinner Special with beef broccoli and sesame chicken. Beef broccoli and beef Kung pao arrived. Both were good but not at all what we ordered. CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE HE LEAVES. He tried to charge us again, Prob just an honest case of wires being crossed since we ended up getting a delivery. My huge problem is the big a$$ oil stain he left in the driveway. The amount of oil that leaked in the maybe 2 minutes he was out of the car is aggressive. He had to know. He's filling up that car with oil on the regular with this leak. PARK IN THE STREET. Maybe why delivery times are so bad because the delivery guy has car troubles? I don't know. That sucks but so do huge oil stains on my driveway.

The ambiance is great. We sat inside at a community table, plenty of room, we weren't on top of each other at all. We asked our server, Milan, to order for our party. So happy we did that. Persian cucumbers, shiitake mushrooms, fresh pasta with braised lamb and a whole crispy fish. OH EM GEE. Order it all. Delicious and perfect. We also had a few Old Fashioneds, very tasty. We had wonderful service, Milan is great. The manager greeted us and made sure we were taken care of. We will definitely be coming back to enjoy Ocotillo again!!
