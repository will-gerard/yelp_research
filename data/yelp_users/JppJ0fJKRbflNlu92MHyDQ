Best draft beers in town. Severed ice cold in a frost glass. Food is great, but even if it wasn't I'll still come here for the beer because it's that good.

Came here for my first time for friday night dinner and waited for 10mins. for a host. Didn't get service even though the place was empty. We left. Get it together, it's a Friday.

I can't say thank you enough.  These guys will work their a$# off to make your event a success.  We had 3 shifts and they feed everyone.  Not a single compliant.  Everyone had nothing but good things to say about how great the food was.  Many of our management team just came back from training in Texas and back East, and they dine at some really good BBQ spots, but none of those could compare to what they just had.  I promise if you book these guys for your next event, you won't be disappointed.  People should celebrate more often, so they could enjoy great BBQ! I know we will be asking them to come back.
