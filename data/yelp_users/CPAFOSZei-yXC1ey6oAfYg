I must say I was extremely disappointed in my burger and what I thought was onion rings for $2.29...the burger was just ok...I got the regular size bacon cheeseburger which was $5.99 and the gentleman said it was a 1/3 lb which was more like 1/4...The bacon and burger were cooked great but the overall burger felt like a glorified McDonald's burger...I got the onion rings as my side only because the employee who took my order said they were his fav...They are just lightly battered onion straws you see as a burger topper all over the place...I will definitely not be coming back here!!!

I found this place on Yelp and it lived up to the great reviews! I had the Vegetarian Spring Rolls and the Classic Banh Mi...Super Fresh and delicious!!! I'll be returning for sure!!! I definitely wanna come back and try the BMB Special and Boba!!!
