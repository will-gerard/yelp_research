I might need to try this place again to see if my order just got messed up. I ordered a vegetarian fajita to go. The guac was good and fresh. There were no tortillas and no beans so I had to buy a bag of peanuts after I ate this since I was still hungry. I do not eat a lot at one time as well. Aren't veggie fajitas supposed to come with beans?

This was my 1st visit. The receptionist said I would love Amanda. She was wrong. I brought in photos from a foreign magazine which costs me 3 times to get as an American magazine. I explained to Amanda that I wanted her to work with my natural waves. i also said, "I do not want you to dry my hair straight first and then make it wavy." She used this sock thing on her dryer. She dried my hair straight. She asked me what I thought of it. I told her I did not like the way she dried my hair. I said this is not what I asked for. That it was straight and not wavy and I said to her I think you should redo it. She started giving me all sorts of suggestions about how to dry it wavy which is not what I asked for. Then she took a curling iron and put a bunch of ringlets in it which a.) are not my style. I wanted sexy and modern not romantic English countryside, b.) I told to not dry my hair striaght 1st and then make it wavy & c.) I never said I wanted curly. When I went out that evening I was embarassed by my hair instead of happy with it and angry with Amanda for doiing exactly what I very specifically asked her not to do and also for not giving me what I paid for. I am not sure about the haircut yet as I have not washed my hair. Also the tiny bit of volumizing product she put in left my hair completely flat at the roots which matched none of my pics. What can I say. Should I have said I am not leaving until rewash and redo my hair? I am still in need of a good styllst after being in Phoenix over a year. Haircut plus tip cost me $60 but I was so angry when I left that I would really like my money back. I called in and complained Saturday night. She is supposed to call me back.I explained how poor her customer service was in not giving me what I wanted and trying to get me out the door with suggestions and doing the horrible curling iron thing with the extra hot salon curling iron. The curls are finally loosening up a day later.

DO NOT GO TO THIS P F CHANGS UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO PAY IN CASH!! I went there with my mother yesterday. She is visiting from another state. She left her credit card there. I called at 6:30 and got the complete brush off. A promise that the manager would call me. They said they were busy. HELLO. Checking to see if a customer left a credit card there is a priority in this day and age. My mother & I were calling. They put her on hold forever. They said it was not there but it is the last place she used her card.

When I first was in this restaurant, I asked the employees what region of Mexico is the food served in the restaurant from. One of the waiters told me, "Mexico". I said I see your food is Mexican. It says that on the door but what region is it from? Oaxaca, Senora, Baja? One of the employees then said it is New Mexican. I asked so is it Americanized Mexican Food? I was then told there is a pepper that only grows in New Mexico that all the food is flavored with. I asked what are the vegetarian entrees. The employee told me she could not remember and left me to read through the menu until I found one. They also had some cookies called bruschettitos. I said to the employee, "I know bruschetta are twice baked cookies. What kind of cookies are these? Mexican wedding cookies?" She said she did not know but she said they are really good with milk or coffee. I ordered a vegetarian burrito which came with a side of beans and rice. I ordered this to go. The burrito is the worst burrito I have ever had. I ate one bite and could not eat any more. I could eat two bites of the rice. Only the pinto beans were good. The employees do not seem to know anything about the food they are serving. Apparently one employee thinks Mexico is a region of Mexico.

St. Francis is the patron saint of animals and he was a vegetarian so why does a restaurant named after him have I believe it was 1 veg entrees and 1 veg appetizer? The veg entree was a rice bowl. Rice is cheap. A rice bowl is big bowl of cheap simple carbs. Nothing special. I believe St. Francis would feel dishonored by this restaurant. Some of the fries I nibbled off my friend's plate were good but you can get good fries at nearly any place. Ketchup tasted store bought rather than made by the restaurant. Atmosphere was nice.

I love this place. They will substitute grilled tofu for any fish plate and unlike most places they do a great job of it. When I was disappointed at the menu at Los Dos Molinos, I left the group there and went here by myself to make sure I got a good dinner. It is my fav place to eat so far in Phoenix.

I love to make fajitas with black beans and sweet potatoes. This place is the only place I know that has black bean & sweet potato soft tacos. I can't give them a five star because I save those for places I love where I usually can't make it myself but I am definately a fan.

The Brussel sprouts were so horrible I returned them after one bite. It was still on my bill when I got the bill. Trying to order was an ordeal. I explained to the waitress that I was vegan and would like the pasta. I asked them to make the pesto for me without the cheese which is very easy to do. She said they could not because they make it in big batches. This really means they do not make it at all. It is ordered pre-made. I asked what other sauce is available. She said they could add a butter sauce. I asked if they use a vegan butter. She said no. I asked about the Brussel sprouts. She explained everything on them including bacon as though that was a vegan product. I told I do not eat bacon. She said it could be made without bacon. I had to eat sweet potato fries for dinner because I did not want a salad and the Brussel sprouts were horrendous.
