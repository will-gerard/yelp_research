BCBS cancelled my plan and Layle at Focus Benefits made it so easy, I'm almost speechless. I thought it would take me hours to find a plan that was affordable and took all of my doctors. I got Layle on the phone immediately and she took the time to explain what was happening and what my best options were. She then sent me some options.   From talking to her to filling out my application, it took no more than a half hour and I feel confident that I was talking to someone that cared about me and was knowledgeable. I highly recommend using Focus Benefits for insurance.

I have taken my care here twice for major and minor repairs and all I have to say is this place has their sh*t together.    Very honest, super friendly, they are on twitter/facebook, have coupons, coffee, follow-up with a survey and they make you feel like they care about your time there.  Compared to most mechanics - they are amazing!  I highly recommend taking your car to either location.  They obviously care about their business and don't treat it as a hobby.

Amazing, Amazing, Amazing!!  Finally, a massage place that gives great massages with a great experience.  I've been there twice now and both times, my massage was perfect.    It's located in a converted house on the south side of Indian School Rd., nice decorations and the people are all very friendly.  The massages are moderately priced so if you're looking for the deal of the century, go somewhere else, you get what you pay for here.  I've tried some of those deal places and the massages weren't great.  Here, GREAT massage at a great price.  I highly recommend.

I am writing this review strictly on the cupcakes, I have not and do not wish to try anything else, but the cupcakes are amazing.    My friends and I had a cupcakes and champagne party for my birthday - everyone brought cupcakes from different places around town for a side-by-side taste test and Tammie Coe's Ooey Gooey's won hands down.  Warning: If you do not like frosting, you will not like Tammie Coe's Cupcakes.  There isn't a ton of frosting, but a fair amount so if you are one of those that likes scant amounts of frosting, this isn't for you.   Other notables from Tammie are the Coconut and Red Velvet - they are always crowd pleasers.  Great frosting, great cake and wonderful colors/designs, Tammie Coe's are great to take or have at a party....or even have LGO deliver to your car on your way home from work. :)

I have to begin this by saying that I am not from Chicago.  The midwest, yes, but I have only visited, but given the crowds this place packs in, I had high expectations of the dogs and the burgers.    My boyfriend said, "eh" on the hamburger and I had the same opinion on the hot dog.  Nothing special and I have definitely had better - even at a roadside stand.  The service and atmosphere were great along with the prices, but I didn't feel like any of the food made me want to go back.

Love, love, love the croissants here.  They are so soft and flavorful, not like ones you can buy at any store around here that I know of.  I first tried one when I got one wrapped as a baby shower take-away gift.    I haven't tried the sandwiches, but the staff was super friendly and the hot tea was only a buck!  I thought it was very reasonably priced comparatively speaking and their marketing was professional.  Not the best atmosphere I've ever seen, I'd give it a 7 or 8.

The atmosphere in this place is very relaxing and the owner is so nice and attentive. Sushi and chinese are available. Great, quiet date place with friendly bartenders and there are always drink specials it seems.   I find this a great date place b/c of the dark-sh, quiet atmosphere.  The food is okay, not the best chinese I've had which disappoints me because everything else about this place rocks, but the food isn't as fresh as it could be.  I will definitely go again because it is close to my house though and because the owner is so amazing.

After reading the reviews, I have to admit, i haven't tried the cupcakes.  I have been there many times for a scone and coffee though and the service is impeccable.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is the atmosphere, well, the chairs and tables.  I prefer something a little more comfortable and plush, but if you are into industrialish decor, this is for you.

Out of all the bbq restaurants in Phoenix, this one by far is the best one I have been to.  My boyfriend and I are from KC and, of course, claim to know bbq.  Bobby Q's isn't as good as some of my favorites around the country, but for Phoenix, I give it an A+.  Many of the establishments in town have ok meat, but horrible sides.  Bobby Q was great all around!  From the corn bread, to the bbq sandwiches and finally the mini-donuts for dessert (that were even hot) everything was fantastic.    The venue is a bit more upscale than most bbq joints and the parking lot and restaurant itself are gigantic.  Don't worry about getting a spot on a week night, there is plenty of room!

I am writing this review for one reason only - the Deconstructed Fish Tacos.  I am in LOVE with them and when I say LOVE, I mean obsessed.    These "tacos" are ready to be assembled when they come to your table with a thick, steak-like, grilled white fish, corn tortillas, salsa, black beans that actually taste good and a slaw....this slaw is what makes the dish.  It is comprised of edamame, corn, cabbage and who knows what else, but The Vig has hit it on the head.    Now The Vig has been a neighborhood staple for years, a great place to drink and eat on the patio and meet friends for a game, but with this new menu revision, I am just loving the food.  Great job!  Now if they would just redo the dessert menu, they could have 6 gold stars...

I LOVE the Wag!  Their employees know every item in the store, so any question you have about health, grooming, you name it, they know it.  I prefer to treat myself and my pets naturally and anytime I have needed something, they have had it in stock.  Last year I used the self wash with my dog and found it very easy as they had everything I could ever want in a handy bucket - they really have thought of everything.   If you haven't stopped in to check it out, you should go next door and get a coffee and copper star and stroll around.

Super nice, honest and on time.  I was very impressed with Rosalee and how nice she was on the phone, the follow-up and then Russ (the owner) even arrived a few minutes EARLY for our appointment.    They use all natural, organic, no VOC cleaners so my house doesn't smell to high heaven and the couches I had done are very clean.  I highly recommend!

I had been very excited to check out the Tea Loft and finally had a chance to drop in.  While it had some good points, overall I would say it was ok, but both my friend and I felt there was something "off".  The Tea Loft has the normal shelves of teapots like a Souvia or Starbucks, but then had tables set for a dinner menu that matched Cafe Boa.  It felt like a tug of war between wanting to get an iced coffee to-go or order the salmon.    It did have a few rooms in the back for large groups and they were beautiful.  If you need a place for a shower, birthday or group, you should at least look at the back rooms.  The desserts they had were exquisite and the tea I had was good, but there wasn't a large selection of teas.  All in all, a mixed experience.

I haven't had food this good with such great atmosphere in a LONG time.  Most new restaurants are usually lacking in one, but The Mission is great all the way around.   Every item I have tried has been fantastic, their margaritas are new and different and the atmosphere - for both brunch and dinner - is perfect.  I highly recommend if you are looking for a semi-nice/nice night out on the town and enjoy Tapas-style food.

I haven't had this great of an experience at the dentist in years!  Dr Tran took her time, made my procedures painless and really tried to work with me and my budget.  Not only is she a great dentist, but her office is completely environmentally friendly (down the the tile and paint) and the tv's on the ceilings made the procedures fly by.   I HIGHLY recommend!

Love this place and love working here!  I like to go to local establishments as often as possible and this is the only coffee house in Old Town that I can find.  The staff is super-friendly and the atmosphere is great.  Couches, high-boys or tables to choose from and free wi-fi.  I highly recommend! The only reason I give it 4 stars is the selection of coffees are not as varied as most, but they have the basics - smoothies, lattes, coffee and scones, etc.

I have been going to them since they opened and I have to agree with everyone on here -   Very affordable ($5 for the cheapest wash) Free towel to clean your car (this is what sold me) Free vacuums  I also want to mention their GREAT customer service.  I had a problem with a gift card and within seconds, they offered a solution - no hassles at all!  Now I am a forever customer.   I love not having to get out of the car and wait, I can zip through and have a clean car in minutes - inside and out.

I think Mr Goodcents has the best subs in town.  I have no idea why people go to Subway.  Goodcents slices the meat and cheese when you order your sandwich and their bread is baked fresh - you can't beat it.  Get oil and vinegar on your sandwich and the taste is to die for.    The staff was very friendly and oftentimes the owners are there working.  $5 footlongs are there too - only they taste 20x's better!  They're all over the city if this one isn't in your neck of the woods.

If you're looking for a calm workout in a great atmosphere, you may want to check this place out.  I am not into the loud pounding music they play at At One Yoga so when I found this studio, I was very pleased.    The studio is one room in the basement of Sachi Salon.  I enjoyed browsing all the hair, nail, skin and boutique items before heading down to class and think that every teacher I have met has been very welcoming and nice.    I "grew up" doing yoga the traditional Ashtanga style so finding a studio that had a class without music or at least soft enough for me to hear the instructor is nice.  The classes range from basics to traditional Ashtanga and are usually morning, noon and night.  Check it out if you are looking for a truly relaxing, meditative experience - I highly recommend!

LOVING that we have a cool, comfortable place to work with a patio that has atmosphere.  I wasn't loving the food, but they had a good selection of drinks, teas and smoothies.  The atmosphere is great for working and there are plenty of outlets.  Oh, and the bathroom is very nice - a plus in my book.   Definitely going to be one of my main places to hang out with my computer.

I think this is the best hamburger in town.  Why the 4 stars?  I'm a woman and the atmosphere was definitely a sports-bar, no windows kind of place.    The sweet and sour burger was amazing.  Be ready for a very tall burger that you cannot get your mouth around, but the taste of it was unlike anything I've ever tasted.  Candied jalapenos and watercress on top of a juicy burger.  For dessert, donuts with caramel sauce - very tasty.    Overall, a very good experience that I will go back for, but definitely a "guy" kind of place to hang out and watch the game.

Love the atmosphere, the patios, drinks and especially the chicken lollipops.  If you haven't tried them, they are buffalo wings with a handy bone to hold on to while you eat.  The sauce with blue cheese dressy is one for the record books!  I am also a fan that they serve breakfast 7 days a week and have free wifi.  This is a great place to meet for work or meet after a game.  Not too stuffy, but nice enough that it isn't just labeled a bar.

I was blown away by this place on opening weekend.  I haven't been back, but the Kobe burger my guest and I had was amazing.  Both of us couldn't believe how flavorful it was or how great the patio was.    Cool concept - outdoor seating that huge and has many different areas and tables to sit at, along with tvs.  Pei Wei concept of ordering food and having it delivered to your table.  The manager personally came over and asked us how our food was and given how busy it was, I couldn't believe he took the time to do that.    We had a great experience here with the patio and the food, I will definitely recommend to friends and go again.

Wonderful, fast service.  Leonard was very friendly, on time and honest about what needed to be repaired and what didn't.  We had an ice maker go out, not something that you HAVE to have so it was nice to get the pros and cons of replacing it or not.    Courteous on the phone, in person and great service!

I will never eat a regular hot dog again!  If there were 10 stars, I would give it!  Large hot dogs, garlic-chipotle mayo, mustard, coconut and pineapple - sounds weird, but it was a flavor explosion.  We had Maui Dog for lunch and I wanted to go there for dinner.    The venue is casual with indoor and outdoor seating.  The owner was very helpful in explaining the menu and the place was fairly busy.  Be ready to try something new and not expect the same boring hot dog with ketchup and mustard.  Well worth it!!

Love the big patio under the trees, loved the inside ambiance and the food and service were great.    I had the Caprese Salad and my fiance had a pizza.  Both of us loved our meal, the wine and the service.  If you're looking for a great date place or somewhere to hang out on a patio with wine, this might be the place for you.  Spasso is located in Town & Country, kind of behind Trader Joe's.  The owner was very nice, helpful and the prices were reasonable.

I've used Moore and Sons a few times and have always been impressed with how punctual, honest and knowledgeable Gary (the owner) is.  He is licensed in how to clean carpet, tile, restore your house, etc and it definitely shows.    This time around he cleaned my tile and saved me about $200 over competitors, since he didn't do other steps that he deemed wouldn't clean it any more than it was.  I appreciate his honesty and you can just tell that he is a nice guy.  I highly recommend!

Where do I begin?  The owner not only has 25+ years of experience working with Neiman Marcus, Dillards, etc, but she is so passionate about her work and friendly to work with, you can't help but want to go back.    Jenny was so passionate about making sure that I FELT good in my dress and kept stressing how the important part was making you feel good.  You can tell she loves what she does and loves helping people feel good about themselves and their clothes.    I got a quick appointment, she has quick turnaround and a very clean studio.  I always have a problem not being able to communicate with alterations people, but not with Jenny.  I highly recommend using Perfect Bride for any alterations, not just your bridal gowns.

I hired Matt based upon his Yelp reviews and all I can say is, it got weird.  He was very prompt in getting me a quote and professional in following-up, but from there on out it was all downhill.   I get the feeling that he has his own business because he doesn't get along with others well.  After I hired him, many of my emails went unanswered, he would ask me to be at home when he serviced my yard, but then wouldn't show up at that time...I called, no answer and no call back.    He certainly doesn't go above and beyond in his service from my experience. I've had way better service from my current guy.

I'm updating because when I emailed to cancel my service, I received a reply 2 minutes later of, "OK".  That's it.  Now I've done an online review and he answers wth paragraphs.  I think the bottom line with Matt is he knows yards, but if you want to change your service in any way, you're a pain and he lets you know it with his attitude.  Once I hired him, I was made to feel like, "Get out of my way, I know my stuff and if you change things, it's a pain."  That's not what I want when I'm a new customer.   When I wrote to cancel, I said, "The communication was lacking and it wasn't up to my standard, please acknowledge that you received this."  His answer, literally, was "OK".   This just confirmed why I was cancelling and in my opinion, why he's so defensive about my review.  He knows it wasn't the right way to answer my email.   Use him if you'd like, your lawn will look great, just be prepared for the attitude.

The layout and architecture of this Starbucks makes it a great place to work or read. It's very different than any other Starbucks I've been in.   I've been here multiple times and the people that work there are always very nice and accommodating. Not only that, professional.   I was there in the evening one time and some kids were being very loud both outside and inside.  After about ten minutes they told them they needed to go. I thought how they did it was nice and thoughtful to the other patrons.

I don't even know what makes the food so good here, but even the simple items are amazing. My husband and I had dinner and brunch here and both of us are continually blown away by the rich flavors of our dishes.   The ice cream for dessert and again, the flavors! It isn't just chocolate, but a rich chocolate with cinnamon and a bergamot ice cream.  Just amazing. I highly recommend this place for any meal, I've never been disappointed!

Amazing, amazing, amazing.  When I read all the 5 star reviews I thought maybe they had paid for them or something, but after my experience I understand why.  These guys are legit!  I took in my brand new iPhone 6 that had sat in a pool of water for 30 min.  These guys knew everything about phones and how to take them apart and put them back together.  My phone didn't end up working b/c of how damaged it was, but I'm so grateful they were there to at least do a diagnostics on it - for half the price I would have paid anywhere else.  Take your phone here, they're the real deal.

You would never think a Popsicle could be this good, but this place is a whole different experience. I had the lavender lemonade and my son had the strawberry watermelon (I think that's the right flavor) and both of us loved them. We even did the special deal of 10 for $25.   I was in the mood for sorbet and this place filled the order. Customer service was great too. If you're looking for a refreshing dessert I definitely recommend giving this a try.

I can't believe I'm going to review a First Watch, but we have had such amazing experiences at this one that I have to.   I've eaten here a few times and both times they've been so nice to us and amazing with our kids. Each time they've been quick about getting some food or drink for the kids and they've even played and talked to them. The decor inside the restaurant is modern and new and the food has been great. Most other First Watch's I've been to have dirty and old, not this one. I highly recommend, these people really enjoy their jobs and you can tell.
