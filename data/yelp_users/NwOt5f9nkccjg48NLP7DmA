Dr Rebbelke is the worst doctor ever. Very rude and suggests hippy alternatives. No one goes to doctors for hippy alternatives. Front staff also pushed multiple people in front of me extending my wait to an hour past my appointment time. Why bother having appointments if your walk ins get priority.

Ordered a sandwich at 2:30pm it's now 3:25 pm and still don't have a sandwich. Sadly this is common for this jimmy johns.  Freaky fast is just a slogan not a realistic expectation. This happens every time I order from here. Going forward I'll spend the 2 dollars more to order from Zella's.

Super quick repair. My iPhone 5S works perfectly. Very happy with the repair!  Sadly I'm terrible at taking care of my phone. My screen was literally shattered and falling into pieces. Cutting my fingers when ever I'd answer a call. But 1 phone call and about $80 - $90 later my phone was good as new. Apple Store wanted $130 plus tax and couldn't see for 2 weeks! These guys were at my house fixing my phone in less then 12 hours. Next time I break my phone I know who to call.
