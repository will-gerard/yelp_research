Okay, I was only in the joint long enough to grab my pre-ordered pizza -- it seems like an awesome dive to grab a drink and see a show -- not an awesome place to order a pizza from. This was THE WORST PIZZA I have ever had in my life. I couldn't even choke down one piece.  After using several paper towels to remove a good chunk of the dark orange grease film, I took a bite and it tasted like soap. SOAP! It worries me that there is someone working there that thinks that the pizza is okay to serve to people. I don't think there is any amount of beer or vodka in the world that would have made this taste good.  I understand that I should have known better to order a pizza from a bar, but it was late on a Sunday and it was the only option since the jerks at Jamie's never answer their phone.

Okay so we decided to give good ol' Long Wongs another shot. After we were in there meeting friends for a drink, we saw a couple of their pizza's and they looked ...awesome. We decided to go back a couple days later to pick up a pizza. It was actually one of the better pizza's I have had recently. We've been back several times over the last two months and haven't had a bad meal yet.
