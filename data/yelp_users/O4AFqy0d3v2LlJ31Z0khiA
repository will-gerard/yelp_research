I m so frustrated. Should've checked reviews. Been here since 10a (it's now 4) for a rear brake job- rotors and new brakes-- and an oil change. If this isn't 100% perfect when I leave here and everything doesn't feel right, I'm calling corporate. Horrible rude customer service- they take advantage of women. Never coming back.

Scott is a pro! He helped us with our building and lumber needs as we're making a wine crate coffee table :) and was very informative and helpful with a newbie DIY couple like my fianc√© and I. I will be sure to recommend him again at this location!! Thanks Scott!

Best place to eat in Raintree shopping center! Excellent service-- smiling and happy people. When you eat in, they take your trays and ask you if you need a refill. Fast drive thru-- awesome market salad!

Really like this place-- excellent member options and pricing starting at $49.95 (no contract, no cancel-- can freeze at any time)! I was sold! The sweet British girl and her nice calming accent was very welcoming. Looking fwd to returning :)

Great place for froyo. 12 flavors to choose from and all the fix-ins. Convenient location. Mix the toasted marshmallow with chocolate frosty and then top with cookie dough and hot fudge. A great place to finish up a date or after a good home cooked meal.

i love this place! i always get the best carwash - very detailed and clean for not much more than dannys! i like the way they treat you here and dont try to take advantage. i'm sitting here getting an oil change, windshield repair, and full detail and it should only take 2 hours for all and only about $120! hallejujah!!!

Kimberly was great!!!! She did the best acrylic fill in I've ever had-- fast, and my nails look oh so natural!!! I am so pleased. Then she topped them off with gel polish that looks to die for. My nails are so thin and look like real nails not fakes-- all for $38! She didn't charge me for my 2 repairs either. Can't wait to come back!

Yummy!! Trying the polish sausage today-- I usually get the chicken sandwich but today it's time for something new! Coworkers always get the Italian sausage and yummy French Fries and onion rings. I have to say that next time I come, I am committing to getting a milkshake!

Sip and Twirl was the best decision we made in planning our wedding! I simply do not know where to start... I worked with S&T for about a year (I chose the 30 days-out package and the Design Consultation add-on) and the quality and attention that I received throughout that entire year was standalone. Retrospectively, I could never have put a price on the level of service we received.   Laurie, Kate and Emily served as my constant therapist and friend (depending on what day it was and how stressed out I was :) and for that I am forever grateful. Truthfully, my groom should be the one writing this as S&T helped me more that we could've ever imagined and were so nice to have just a phone call (or vox!) away! They helped me pick out vendors, put together my welcome bags which ended up so cute!, and stored all of my decor items for months on end while planning so many more weddings! Without Kate & Emily, we would've been lost, stressed and tired! Instead the entire process was so pleasant and our wedding day was truly the best day of our lives.  Having an out-of-town family and an in-town wedding can get messy at times but they helped me plan every minute detail and i mean EVERY DETAIL with flying colors and managed budget expectations with my family back in Ohio.   I couldn't have had a better experience planning our wedding thanks to the love and support from S&T. They made the wedding day and I really should say wedding year a breeze.   Thank you Sip & Twirl - you all are incredible and SO talented at what you do... I am so thankful that I chose you.   Love,  Erin & Russell Reese   P.S. I'm sure this review will remain a work-in-progress as not a day goes by without me realizing something that you all did to make our day better than we could've ever imagined.

What a workout!! Great cardio circuits and awesome interval/ strength training keeps my body guessing. Chris is my favorite instructor and Jeff, Kelsey and Kathy are very kind and welcoming. Paying upwards of $79/month for 8 classes (intro rate) is well worth it! Busiest classes: 4:30/ 5:45pm M-F, Sat 8am, 10:30am... Steer clear if you want a pod!

Great place to go routinely. The prices are great and she makes you feel very comfortable with pleasant conversation... can't get better than a $46 Brazilian! She used to work at European wax center so she still uses hard wax-- which if you've never tried it, is amazing (pain free, no sticky residue, less ingrowns etc)! I am so happy to have found her! Go check her out!!

I'm so upset to write a bad review about this delicious place but my visit today was NOT OK. I ended up walking out without a meal that I paid for because I had waited FAR too LONG.. and am hoping I receive a call back from the manager with a full refund and some sort of coupon for future meals to make up for this bad experience. Other customers were waiting for an hour or even longer as they rushed to get out a catering order. It was absurd that they didn't help the people there that were waiting for individual meals and put the catering order on hold. I'm certain that Vermont Sandwich Co lost a lot of loyal customers today and I'm sad to be considered one of them today.

Danielle is so awesome- I have been going to her for years and am so happy every time! She always does exactly what I ask and fulfills my vision but also uses her expertise and recommends trendy styles and colors that she thinks would better suit me which I am very thankful for! We've done ombre, short haircuts, extensions etc! She is a great colorist and hairstylist and only uses the best products- they always smell amazing too! She's so fun to talk to and a great friend; I cant wait for her to do my hair on my wedding day in September!

We had a great time today outside on the dog friendly patio -- they even gave Scout a comfy bed and bowl of water! We started with the hot wings and then I ordered the chicken chop salad with quinoa and russ had the breakfast burrito brunch special with amazing French fries and the dragon eyes seasonal beer while I had the fresh-brewed iced coffee. Delicious! We love the new chef and this was the best food we've had since we've been probably 5 times now. We will be back most definitely and Alexandra, our server, was delightful! Thanks two brothers!!!

I got my lashes done here before my wedding and it was a great experience. It was fast and pretty natural looking. The girl was a great conversationalist and made me feel very good evening though it's not necessarily comfortable with all the chemicals and smells. I will be back. Thanks!

We have been to Majerles numerous times before. However this time we were appalled the poor customer experience. We were there on a Monday night during a football game. The appetizer took 30 minutes to come out and the single entree took 45 minutes after that. The kitchen was backed up but these times are unacceptable. We likely will not be back which is a shame since we like watching games there and enjoyed our precious meals there. .

my expectations were high for this place and we went here during monday of restaurant week. the chowder was excellent but then the meals came and i got the broiled marlin that was part of the fixed menu and there was a hair in my food and the manager didnt comp the meal -- he just brought out the same dish just newer. i am not impressed and will not be back to give them my business. rice krispie treat desert was strange and not warm - what gives?
