If you or anyone you care about has muffler problems, come here!! My FJ cruiser had a rattle underneath from a boulder mishap for years. I was referred here and 20 minutes and $25 later it was good as new! Dealer had told me it was going to be so expensive that I would be better off making an insurance claim. I am so glad I was given the right advice to come here.

If you are looking for a dive bar, here you go. Nothing fancy, just good drinks, better prices and a fun atmosphere tucked away. Iguana balls are tasty as well.

This is one of the finest gun ranges/stores I have visited. During the weekend it can be crowded with a lot of people just browsing, but you can still get on the range. Membership helps a lot too. If you are looking to purchase come to SGC during the week and you will get a lot of attention from helpful staff. This store is very competitive when it comes to pricing. Great experience in purchasing and shooting from here.

Yeah, Im a straight guy who goes to Regis. Its a great place to get a hair cut. Who doesnt like a shampoo and scalp massage along with a trim??  Havent had a bad stylist yet. Shawna is very good and always delivers.

Im not here to comment state of the mall, I just think there is a shortfall in decent offerings at this center.  Worth the drive to PV or Arrowhead in my opinion.

Nice local mall that has a lot of stores and is easy and convenient to get in and out of. The new theater inside is really nice.

Their food is SO good, the bar staff is AWESOME, and the Vig Rig will take you home.   The Vig Uptown is one of my favorite spots to spend a weekend evening.

Best secret ever! This theater is so convenient and nice. While its not the easiest to find, once you're inside it is first class. The prices are the lowest around and everthing is brand new.  Definately give this a try the next time you're doing dinner and a movie. Now that PV mall has Oregano's, Chipotle, and Culvers in the parking lot it is a great date spot.

Great place to go for honest assessment of what you want or need. I recommend this place to all my friends. The work is first class and affordable. You won't regret choosing this shop to have your windows done. My FJ cruiser looks great and is much cooler inside on these hot summer days.
