My husband and I went to My Shu for dinner tonight. I can sum up the food in just one word "YUM"! Everything was so good, the veggies were so fresh, spring rolls to die for. I had the Veggie My Shu with fried rice. It was huge and absolutely the best Mu Shu ever. My husband had Sweet and Sour chicken and he loved it. He can be a bit picky about Asian food and this place was a hit. The service was wonderful, everyone was very friendly. I loved the open kitchen concept. I could see right into the kitchen and it was super clean. 5 Stars!!

I went to Rhicco today and he was awesome. I had a cut and highlights.  He listened to exactly what I wanted and offered suggestions. He explained each type of cut he was doing and why. My color turned out perfect and natural looking just as I had wanted. I highly recommend him.  The Salon was nice and clean and the rest of the staff was great. I saw a lot of happy people leaving the salon.

I went here intending to purchase a wig and ended up buying two. They have a nice selection of wigs.  The 2 men that were working were a great help and offered suggestions. The store was clean and organized.

I was so excited to go to Taco Guild. A couple of friends had good things to say and I was eager to see how the Church had been turned into a restaurant. I was a little concerned with the 3 star rating in Yelp. The restaurant was really nice inside and out. I love that they kept the stained glass. To start off with it took about 10 minutes for our server, she blamed the long wait in another table. As an starter we had the Handmade Guacamole, it was super bland. It seems to be really basic onion, a little tomato and the avocado. We tried adding some salt and pepper, it didn't help. My husband doesn't like a lot of spiciness, when we asked for a recommendation the reply was "everything has a kick." I tried three tacos and received a free side. The Yucatan Shrimp was only ok. The Peking Duck was bad, the duck was very dry and the taco was over powered by the Apricot compote. The Thai Snapper was good, really small for the size. Tacos for $4.95 not again for us. The best thing I had tonight was the Pacifico, maybe I should have had more than one.

What a great experience.  One of the best attractions of the Valley. Young and old alike will enjoy their time in this beautiful oasis. Standing among thousands of beautiful butterflies flying around you was an overwhelming experience. Every where you look there is a photo op. The area with the fish was great.  We got to pet and feed the stingrays. The large tanks help fish from around the world. I recommed this for everyone.

I just love this place. I have stuff in consignment and have purchased things as well. The owners are super nice and all the merchandise is top of the line. Great deals! You've just got to check out Classy Kitchen.
