Best sandwich place ever!!! Jamaican red is my personal favorite. For extra kick try it with the spicy ranch dressing... Very neat place and has one of a kind sandwiches and treats for a great price! Super friendly hippy chic and trendy with superior staff!

I love love love this place!!! My family and I love the Cup Cakes. My favorite is the chocolate peanut butter. The topping is a peanut butter frosting adorned with chocolate sprinkles. No mistaking peanut butter in this frosting. The cake is chocolate yum and super moist! I've also had the red velvet, vanilla glam and the coconut. All are great! They also serve other sweet treats which I'm tempted to try but the cup cakes always reel me in first! The atmosphere and friendly staff is great too! The only con is....it's super busy...hard to find parking on weekends but worth the wait!

I've been coming to masa since they opened...they have a wide variety of sushi, rolls, and appetizers. They also have rice and noodle bowls. The chicken teriyaki over rice is my kids fav... The jalape√±o poppers are the best I've had. They even sub the tuna that usually comes in the poppers for spicy crab meat, which I prefer and highly recommend! Mmmmm.... The service is always friendly and I've never had to wait to be seated. They also greet you at your table with a salad that has a sweet soy dressing that's delish! They also serve a miso soup with the salad. It's a little too salty for my taste tho! Overall great sushi and great experiences with friends and family!

Gross!!! Way too expensive for what you get! I ordered a turkey sandwich... How can you go wrong? Right? Bread was stale, turkey actually had a weird taste, and the toppings were lack luster and practically non-existent to say the least! Prices were so high too... Almost 11$ for a large sandwich meant to split with my hubby but we just threw it out and ate somewhere else! Totally indelible!!! Won't be back!!! Try cheba hut  for one of kind sandwiches at a killer price!
