Easily my favorite pizza. Pastas are amazing too. My daughter loves the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken.

The food is pretty good but the service is without a doubt some of the worst I have experienced. I have tried on several occasions to use Kneaders for business lunches as my office is close by. I place the order ahead of time and each time I have arrived they seem surprised by my request and have to find my order to start preparing it. This last time today it affected an important meeting for me. I waited for a half hour while they made 4 sandwiches and I watched the guy packing it up stop 4 times to text on his phone. He then took it somewhere and set it down. They had no idea anyone was waiting so I had to ask 2 different people to please get me my order. I have given this place several chances to redeem themselves but this is obviously a chronic problem. Not going back.

What an great shop. Alex and his team are knowledgable and professional. The selection of juices is amazing. People make all the difference and these are good people.
