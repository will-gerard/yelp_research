I went in with high hopes, the decor was fun and certainly a hit with the collage crowd. The people were nice and friendly, and I will always be a fan of a place that let's their freak flag high! And the folks working here sure do. +1 to me  My "beef" is the food. it was tasty, just fine, but the garlic bread tasted a tad stale, and I found the amount of meat per sandwich to be a little low. (I ordered a Chronic roast bef... sort of a basic sandwich which lets me see the basics of a place. Perhaps next time I'll read deeper and try another 'wich and ask for extra meat and cheese. Perhaps their a place that only fly's when doing an insane sandwich, I dont know.   I do know that if I could, I would open up a few of these myself near collages, along with Magic Mushrooms Pizzerias and watch the $$'s roll in.   It's like printing money.  Based on reviews, I'll try this one again, perhaps it was a bad day? Bad choice on my part? I'm open to it. Or, it might just not be to my palette.

I love this kind of place.  Unassuming, local greasy spoon-style diner. The staff was as friendly as could be. It was a Sunday, people were chatting. We ordered at the counter, got out glasses filled up with soda and took a seat. The wait was longer than most fast foodies are used to, but to me, it was expected and welcome, fresh diner food made to order takes a tad longer than a microwave. The Bride and I both had a Giant cheeseburger w fries. Granddaughter has hot dog and grandsaon a burger. (the kids being 5 and 12 were the ones who were used to fast food times)  When brought to the table, the burger as shown in yelpers photo's... nothing magical, and certainly by todays indulgent standards FAR from "giant" but a solid diner burger. Fresh fries, nice hot, and crispy. Hot dog, was a standard hot dog on a fresh bun.  So hey buddy... whats up with two stars? The burger was as dry as could be! I couldn't understand it, fresh meat, not sitting out under a lamp to become shoe leather... (I've seen some sins done to meat in diners let me tell ya!)  Then I saw that when cooking the patty, the cook puts one of those bacon weights on it and leaves it there. I could see the fat being squeezed out of it.  Like greasy tears.  Perhaps the breakfast is good, I don't know, seems like the sort of place it would be OK. But I just cant give more than two stars,,,  I wanted to like it more, but frankly, a dry patty is a deal breaker to me.

This is a half review, because the job is'nt completed. I just wanted to say that on Sunday my wife and I had the keys refuse to leave in ignition! Oddest thing i ever encountered. Of course it being Sunday, everyone was closed, but we saw a Just brakes was open near a Jiffy Lube, so we walked in explained our problem to the mechanic, and he said he would take a look at it. The mechanics name is David, and he did everything possible, took apart the steering wheel housing, took apart the shifter to see if it was a sensor that could be bad. After a solid 30-45 minutes he said he felt it was likely a sensor, but that all his suppliers were closed on Sunday. He then showed us how to make the car safe at night so we didn't have to sleep in it, and agreed to look at it when we came in tomorrow. All this ans he refused any form of payment, and even recommended some places closer to where we lived. but for service and competence like that, i'll go out of my way.  I've read multiple bad reviews here, but I can only speak to the mechanic hat helped us, ask for him David, so far, he's won our business. I'll update as the repairs continue.

A quick update, My wife went in the next day to have the ignition issue fixed. after spending a few hours on it, David said he would rather call in a electronics gut who he knew could fix it as opposed to him fumbling about.  A) Why didn't he have the right guy look   at it from the start? But OK, I give him that.  But what gets me is the after charging my wife $130 and getting nothing fixed (which I'm actually OK with, he deserves his labor charge) He then convinced her not to make it a wasted trip and  talked her into aligning the tires, which we need to  do but we need the car to be running first!  He won me over at first, but by taking advantage of my wife when she was in   emotional stress, they lose it all. Which saddens me, I really had high hopes based on my first experience.

Fair food, fair price, very nice folks!  I took the kids here after a day at the Falcon Field Air Museum, they were hot, tired and hungry. After explaining (a few billion times) that this was not "fast food" and the burger wouldnt fly into their mouths as we sped through a drive through, they settled down.  Have I mentioned that my grandkids havent been taught much in the ways of "someplace different"?   I'm working on that. The space is nice, with a mixture of booths, tables and a counter in the front window.  The counter where you order overlooks a clean and shiny grill, with assorted pictures of the offerings for those that have trouble reading the menu board.  With that setup.. heres the rundown. I wanted to try a Chicago style dog, my grandson wanted a hamburger, and the granddaughter wanted a corn dog. The hamburger was a fine if unremarkable version. Which was perfect, decent 1/4 Lb patty & Bun, melted american cheese, nice and tasty. The corn dog was about the same as you would find anywhere, also good (especially for a 3 year old who doesnt like culinary suprises!)  My jumbo hot dog was good, the actual weiner and bun itself was extremely unremarkable, in fact, and I'm sorry to say, I rather prefer the hot dogs at Costco (not the buns though!) it tasted like a cheap beef weiner in a wonder bread roll. The difference was the toppings, and thats what a Chicago hot dog is all about!  It had a small amount of tomato, pickle, peppers and mustard on it.  And I loved the fresh taste they gave it. Much crisper than heavy chili or cheese! My only desire would have been for it to have a heavier helping of the toppings, and in fact when I go back (which I will!) I'm going to request a foolish amount of toppings, I recomend anyone trying it for the first time, just dive right in and join me in ordering extra toppings, after all, thats the point of this style of dog! I ordered a chicago-style tamale because I had no idea such things existed. What I got was a microwave meat tamale that was indeed made in Chicago. It was just a sad, sad beast. I'm sure it's a famous Chicago food, and beloved, and if I was raised there I would crave it, but to me, it was flavorless, soggy in the wrong way, and existed only so that people could drench it in chili and cheese, probably a hit at 7-11's, but not for me. However, at about $1, I was willing to try it, and glad I did, however I shall not be having that one again.   We ordered 3 fries, and two would have done! They load those baskets up!  I would ask for them well done next time, just because I like a slightly crispier fry, but that a minor quibble, zero complains on the fries! Or anything, $15 for a mess of food, cooked to order, by a locally owned shop that cares. I'll certainly go back.  They also sell Gyro's, which I didn't try, even though I've been longing for a great gyro, and Italian sausage and steak sandwiches. I want to try those next.

I love BBQ, Have lived for years in the "BBQ belt" and am open minded to all styles. I don't mind reasonably High prices if the talent and the love/passion are there to support is. Toms was just a let down for me, The prices were high, but for what you gettting, if price is your concern, best go to MCD's for their sandwich. The taste, the vibe, the kindness just wasn't there for us. Heck, the Q was dry! no amount of sauces can cover that up. I had my bride double check me in case I was Having a bad night, but nope, she thought the same.+  I like to grill.BBQ myself, but I love to go out, and have fun while I learn abit, I hope others have better experiences that. I doubt I'll be going back.

Disclaimer, I was raised in New Orleans, and miss good Poor Boys, Crawfish, Boiled shrimp, Jambalaya  etc.... yadda yadda yadda, hear me whine...  I try to be lenient when I go somplace because it's unreasonable to expect to find the food here that I would at the Magazine St. Po Boy shop.  I was also raised on popeyes, every once in awhile I would hop off the Streetcar on the way to school and get a Chicken Biscuit w/cheese.  And frequrntly I would get a 4 piece spicy, and even though it was a chain, it was a local chain with massive quality control.  (and yes, odds are those years are most likely why over the past 3 years I've lost 250 pounds!.... Moderation kids!)  Over the years, the chain was sold off, the original owner died, and Popeye's became more hit and miss, especially the further you got away from the south.  Heck, you get your hopes up just to see a Popeye's! usually the stand alone's are better, and the ones attached to Gas stations are hideous.     I've tried a few in the Phoenix area, And have been generally unimpressed. Not horrible, but just... a very thin flavorless crust.  So it was with trepedation that I went into this location, a drive through, attatched to a gas station. I went for a box of chichen w/biscuits. and I can say it was the best I've had in the city so far. The man at the window was friendly, the chicken was fresh, good, solid breading. With enough heat to give a nice depth of flavor, cutting a bit deeper than other chains would dare... which is what Popyes is all about. (I'm used to some blazing hot chicken... not stupid mind you, just HOT.. this is not that, but a good flavor. With good moist flesh, and thick crunchy skin. And the meal made the travel home well. One downside? I'm just not a fan of these biscuits, they werent old... but they were dry... and lack the lush, buttery flavor and texture that I love. These were more dense and hockypuckish than I prefer.  If your craving some Popeye's chicken... well, lets put it this way,,, I'll be driving 20 minutes out of my way to go here. This is my first time... so Your Milage May Vary..    Sidenote, I'n no Church's Chicken fan, but I went to the one on Arizona Avenue... and I've got to say, thats some fine spicy chicken! And cheap! And a big box of fried okra makes The Bride very pleased indeed!

As a film fan I have to give this theater 2 stars.  Good fresh popcorn, And the t-shirt deal actually makes it reasonably priced! (if only anyone used real butter... alas those days are long gone) Consistently pleasant employees. Good selection of films. But while some may like the "old school" nature of the theaters. when it comes down to it, i go to the theater to see a film, and frankly, the screens are small, the sound systems are meh, and the seats are in need of restoration. And I'm not expecting a Domed Imax experience, but heck, my home theater is more immersive than most of the screens here. I was so looking forward to seeing "Jiro Dreams of Sushi", but when I saw that it was showing here, i realized that it would likely be on one of the lesser screens, and such a beautiful film deserves so much more... so I'll just wait and see it at home. I know that Harkins cares, after the great renovation they did with the Valley Art, I hope they do something similar with this.  But until then, I tend to pass on the screens and see the films elsewhere (usually a Harkins theater BTW as a chain, I like them)

OK, it's a Subway, you know what to expect, if you want a higher end sandwich there are other higher priced options within a stones throw of this location.   I'm just giving it 4 stars on those expectations. And the fact that I used to avoid this specific location, but it has improved a great deal.  The employees have consistently been nice over the last 3 visits (over a few months)  clean location and very quick. Even going so far as to recommend I order another sub but have it dressed differently in order to save money on my order! Losing money on one sale, but making it up in repeat visits. The bread situation as described by others seems to have improved, so they usually have the loafs that I want, which is a real perk. Also the food tastes fresh, which was a problem before, perhaps they used to over prep things and store them to long? Either way, things taste better now, the price is right, and the folks are nice.   For decent cheap fastish food that's not designed to impress, it's a win.(I call it fastish because fast food had a drive through IMHO)  There is better to be had in the area, but not for the price, and especially if you like a lot of things on your sammy this is a great choice

Having just moved to the area, and tiring of searching for tex-Mex in a area that seems to have some sort of (AZ-Mex) thing going on, my Bride and I decided to stop at Joes Farm based purely on the fact that it looked interesting. best decision we made since we moved here! Heres the thing, the slogan they use "Common foods done uncommonly well" is spot on!  We both had the burger with chedder, heres the thing, there was no amazingly different flavor, no crazy spices, no insane toppings, just good, fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection with pride and a level of quality that you dont find very much, especially in a burger! the bun is both light and substantial, and even the pickles are amazing (they make them themselves.. which gives you a clue on how fanatic they are) On our second trip, we ordered the garlic fries... Holy jumping Jack Flash! If you like fries, and you like garlic, GET THESE! Drenched in garlic, these are some of the best fries I've ever had! The decor is fun and retro-futuristic (think tomorrowland 60's retro future, but someones living room)  And after your meal, you can take a stroll through a very nice park area of Agritopia, to walk some of the food off.  Now, if only we could find a decent tex-Mex place, life would be sweet!

*note, sleepless night, just finished my first pot of coffee, so this review might suck*  Hard to find, no sign visible from the street, most people rush past ignorant of it's existence... Even my Sons family who had lived here a year before us had never been there, and he married a coffee person.   Welcome to my "Third Place" I make a fine "cuppa" at home, but a day I don't stop by here is a day that I feel a lack in my life.  By far, my favorite coffee house in years, and here it is in Gilbert Az?  Really? Here? Thank you Starbucks, for convincing the Masses that paying more than a quarter for a cup of Joe was acceptable, even mainstream!   Lovely space, well decorated, by a person with taste, flair and fun, NOT by a committee or a panel or by customer survey. , lots of wood, with a sitting room in the back for your lazy hanging out needs.   Ratty recliners? Not here, Nice... VERY nice leather chairs and sofa with driftwood tables scattered about. Nice artwork on the walls, mixing family photo's, nature photography with understated rock and Roll pictures. (having a pic of Jim Morrisons grave is cool, having a UNPRETENTOUS picture of Jim Morrison's grave is worth a star of its own, there is a fare farmers market out front, but for myself, I like to park in the rear and walk through the garden and patio... It's a oasis amidst the sprawl, the explosion of colors and aromas are a extra treat that shouldnt be missed.  This family understands that the atmosphere, the music, the creation and integration into the lifeblood of the community is what makes a coffeehouse so effen awesome. and effen awesome it is!    And probably most importantly... full of the exact friendly faces you need when getting your java on.   Homemade sugar goodness is available. It's the sort of thing that one dreams coming from your own kitchen, but with a tad more color and odd combinations (Coffee and Cigarettes cupcakes anyone?), to intice you in. Displayed in the front case, drawing you in like a moth to a flame,  like Teri Garr in Young Frankenstein... wholesome goodness you want to introduce your Mom to, yet you know it's soooo bad for you... It's gonna kill you, but your urges make it impossible to say no.  *ahem*  Did I mention awesome cupcakes?  Oh, I guess I just did.  The "real" food is quite wonderful as well, and worth the trip on its own, you simply cant go wrong, the open face omelet is magnificent, sandwiches quiche, burrito's etc, all normal food, but with a flair and style that make every bite full of extra-awesome.   One downside... success.   Alas, they were discovered and won a much deserved "Best Of" award for Phoenix, since then they have had to hire more  people and the family has had to move into the kitchen to keep up.  The service has not diminished, the only downturn is has been in my beloved coffee.  they still remember my families order, but sometimes its not as good as it was, and I view that more as a sign of how much they spoiled me before than anything else.  Business is booming, and they couldn't keep up so they had to hire. It's normal that new people need to be trained, and that any amount of training will not equal years of experience. As other coffeehouses fight and cut corners in these tough times, it says a lot that The Coffee Shop is growing and healthy.   Still, with that all said, this is my favorite coffeehouse in years,   This is a perfect companion to Joes Farm Grill next door. (many reviews on Yelp and elsewhere) Together, they are reason for my Bride and I to want to move to the Agritopia subdivision they are a part of, just to be able to walk there in the morning, along the tree lined streets (rare around here in a work of cactus and ... dirt)

Ok, so first things first, this is a pontless review, I mean you most likely have your opinions set already, but if like me, you move Westward and have always heard of the mythical in-N-out, I figure this might be of use to you. A) it's a chain fast food joint. So set your expectations there. Do I have a favorite burger place? Yes. Is it a fast food joint? Why no, no it's not. Neither is it this FAST (hence the name fast food eh?) or hve a drive through, or so handy after a long day dragon slaying and I just want to get back to my cave and prop my feet up. So lets dispense with the silliness, this place is what it is, it's cheap, surprisingly cheap, fast... usually VERY fast (unless there's a hella rush) Service so friendly that it's almost scary!   As for the food, the meat is decent quality for a chain and fresh, not frozen. tasteless lettuce fresh and crispy for texture, and onions either grilled or fresh cut, your choice. Now to what I tend to order... yeah they have a secret menu, and I've played with it a bit, but I only tend to go when tired and haven't planned in advance, and since I don't care enough to memorize the secret menu, all i know is "animal style" which isn't bad at all, adds a bit of flavor and messiness to the burger, although I only had it the once. The buns are fresh, as are the fries, so i find that they benefit from extra toasting, order them both "well done" I find that especially for the fries, it makes a world of difference. The well done fries are much better than the usual ones.More texture and crunch etc... As for the burger, i like fresh onions, so add lots of those, and they have never let me down.   To the people that view the animal style fries as gross because of the way they "look'? So what? How do they taste? and if it just wasnt for you, then fine, but I have never had them myself, and cant imagine I would ever order them because they looked good (or good for you!) I mean figure out the ingredients, art for the eyes was never the point! I want to try the animal fries myself, i just haven't.   If my fast options are Chick-Fi-Lay/Panda Garden/In-N-Out/Hardee's (Carl's JR out here)I would probably go for one of the burger joints, with the awareness that the entire meal at In-N-Out would cost what the burger at Carl's costs, but sometimes I don't go for cheap, and some Carls are decent.)  But as long as your expectations are reasonable, your not gonna be disappointed by the In-N-Out food.Even if it isn't what you like, its good stuff for what it sets out to be.  Might try that DQ burger a earlier review mentioned if the situation arrives.

I give this rating for the chain.Sadly, this location is closed, I guess it was just a bad location, actually I know it was, because we only went there once in the past  2 years, when we went to the one in Maryland at least once a month. And we would have gone more, but calories are kinda real.  I Think the name put some people off, but those are folks who are to young to get the inside joke from the SNL skit. For us geezers, it was a "hoot"  If your ever in the mood for a GIANT burger, in a fun 50's atmosphere, is a better value than Johnny Rockets, and has AWESOME fried onions. I highly recommend this chain.  The burgers are grilled, not grilled, which is a downside to me, (and cost a star) but there are so many plus's to this chain, I forgive this. All the toppings are fresh, and a nice, big variety to choose from. Not to mention, you can be insane in the amount of topping you out on.  I guess around here in Phoenix, I'll have to give 5 guys a chance. Though I'm really in search of great onion strings/rings etc... I really liked the fact they let me get 1/2 fries and 1/2 onion straws...   Yeah, it's overpriced, it's that kind of overpriced place, for a good day to day burger, drive through in and out.

Its a diner, if you set your expectations towards a diner or Cracker barrel, you'll  be happy. My companions had waffle w/ bacon, Eggs Benedict, and a 'southern Scramble" i had a patty melt. When ordering my patty melt, I requested Rare as they could... so of course it was well done to the point of tree bark! However, the brides Soutthern scramble was insane, so much... everything!  Biscuits, sausage, eggs...  frankly, I would try the omelette version next if I were here. Eggs Bennidict... a winner according to the frieind. And the waffle? Looked like a great waffle, but nothing earth shattering \ Asv for mtn meal Sadly, When asked how I wanted it cooked, I asked as medium rare as possible, and bieng e, i asked for well done, hot fries. well my patty was as well done as zanything I've ever had, zero juice, zero flavor, jusym  VEY well done patty  meat.  And the cheese on the melt? it was sourly lacking... so little cheese, it was worthless. and onions? What onions? I admit, I was very sad by my personal meal. Final insult, the fries that I asked for well done, might have been tasty, 30 minutes before we arrived! They were as cold and flaccid a fry as I've had in forever... made me  wish for any drive through.  Final verdict, I'll go back... the portions are HUGEMONGOUS! and some things seem awesome... so I'll try breakfast,  which seems to be the the winning meal here. Sadly, I've had a better patty melt at Whataburgur.. and I muist restate the sad part of that statement. (The brides scramble seemed a bit much, will post images) so I think next time I'll try a omlette instead)   My advise to my6 friends? Go there! be Hungry But as with most places, nothing is perfect.

I wanted to give them a try, I called in, and even though they are 5 blocks away, I'm out of their delivery range.  5 Blocks kinda threw me, Guess business is good that you cant drive more than 4 blocks. My bad.

I love good food, this includes pizza, and I find that I'm a pizza/food agnostic/nazi. Chicago deep dish "pie" style, crispy new york style... theres something good in all of them. Rustic or high tech, I enjoy it all. I just cant stand thoughless preparation of meals, that would be the "Hard liner" in me. Not to worry, Grimaldi's delivers in every way that matters! From entering on a Sunday evening, everyone was honestly warm in their greeting, chatting about the day etc.  From the tea which was perfect (Mine basic non-sweetened, and The Brides Passion fruit wonderfulness, both were simple, basic and perfect for the meal) Both of us were expecting leftovers, so we opted for a small salad each, knowing that the portions were huge, I just wanted a Greek style salad, while the Bride had zero desire for feta/olives etc so opted for a house salad. So two small *SNORT SMALL!* salads were brought to out table... sheesh! Not so much small as only a buffet on a plate!  My Medeteranion salad was very good, I admit it was blander than I like, Lots of feta, (YAY) however I had asked for extra, and they sure delivered! Strangely enough, the feta was blander than I'm used to, which caught me by surprise. Still creamy and tart, very welcome indeed.  Also, No onions on the salad? I'm sure it was an over site, next time I'll ask for extra onions, (a silly for onions!)  Or a different salad, I tried The Brides house salad and the flavor's were a wonderful balance, the roasted peppers really added a lot of flavors.. smoky/sweet, just wonderfully clean and fresh. On   And then.. to the pizza. So pretty! It's so rare that you look at a "lowly" pizza and see the level of care that went into its construction. We opted for a classic first time benchmark. Pepperoni, sausage, onions with fresh garlic. I usually avoid garlic, but The Bride wanted it, and since it was fresh and not garlic powder, I was open to it. The garlic was quite good, however it wasn't really needed on the pie.The fresh basil, which tasted fresh from the garden, was lovely, and I would order more of that instead of garlic next time. (and possibly meatballs). The crust was this with a good chew. Mozzarella cheese was fresh and NOTHING like the shredded crap you can get at Costco etc.  You can tell the placing of the toppings was done with care, evenly dispensed, but not uniform,  It was without a doubt the best sausage I've had in decades. And the pepperoni was flavorful, although the thick cut did make the texture a tad different, I'm told it was a slicer issue, and not the usual preparation method.    We had a great chat with our server about the restaurant and how it's been going over, also Jennifer who seems to be a manager came over and chatted for a bit, very nice, laid back and fun.   If your in a hurry, and planning a eary dinner, late lunch, I recommend calling first, since the charcoal over requires cheaning once during the day, and it's unable to cook for around a hour or so, so you might want to avoid that period. Also, as a earlier Yelper commented they do not use gloves when making crust, as someone who was a cook in my youth I'm amazed, I mean, making a pizza with rubber gloves? Talk about overkill, and a pain in the rear! Your trusting them to touch your food in other ways, i don't see the issue. Also, the oven gets to 1000% so I'm not worried about anything nasty making it out of there, if anything, I don't want the flavor of melted plastic on my Za! (and I'm not such a germaphobe that I fear chefs touching my food, if I wanted a conveyor belt style meal.. no shortage of options around here.   Pro: Great, classic New York pizza, epic portions, extraordinary pride taken in providing a premium product. with quick, efficient, good natured, prideful service. Passion fruit tea was the best I've ever had.  And We were informed by Jennifer (a manager of some sort i gather) that you can order your pizza like a steak. rare, medium rare, medium, medium well, well done.... all giving different levels of crunch to the dough and toppings etc.  Next time we are going to try playing with that aspect... perhaps some extra cheese and go medium or medium well? Get a tad more of the charcoal crustiness to it.  Con: Limited menu, I know, that a place like this would make a killer meatball & Spagetti, or sandwich! I appreciate the total focus on making the perfect pie... but when the farthest afield they go is a Calzone .. well they are almost rainman level focused! (take it  thats a complement, I'm just greedy, I admit it. The meditiranian salad was blander than expected. They use the same dressing for this salad as for the house salad. Yes, feta helps, but some peperoncini and Greek dressing, would be nice. Next time, I'll either try the Cesare or antipasto, or skip that course. (And a little bread, just pizza dough with s with the salad would be nice). Gimmick or not, the water tastes great! Almost worth not getting a drink and enjoying the delicious aqua!

Nobody would go with me, every day I drive by this shack shaped like a friggen HOT DOG! And the dusty parking lot is full during lunch. And so, I went on my own.  The Good... Hot dogs!! However you want it.. I know nothing about Chi-Town dogs, but I loved the pile of goodness that was on these, Friendly owners that were willing to direct me through the maze, and were even happier to discover that I enjoy exploration with food. I'm not a fan of the fries... the times I've had them they were sort of limp. And the tamales were plastic wrapped and quite bland and mushy... perhaps thats a Chicago thing I dunno, but I like good Tex-Mex Tamales, and these weren't even close to good. Much less as good. And as much less as I hate to say it, the Gyro's are a bland abomination of dull. Dont even try them, presliced, premeasured, microwaved, limp mediocrity. With such a great beef sandwich and such to be had, they should just take tamales and gyros off the menu... no reason to ruin such a great menu with these things, just remove em.  It's a specialty dog, steamed, and served with kindness and family love. Under a giant hot dog sign. And while in many ways I prefer Ted's grilled dogs, Higley has a definite place in my heart, and close to home.  So in closing, nothings perfect, but this place is simply awesome. Give it a try, and please support a local place! And support local people, you'll be a better person for it. And remember, if it's local, it's healthier for you! Really!

When is a Outlet store not a outlet store? When they sell the same things that the regular store does... perhaps theres a "ding" on it. but an outlet store should offer more than 5% or "GASP" 10% off anything in the store!  Skip the outlet store, and buy it at the retail store where they will deliver it for you and give you what serves as Sears customer service these days  the customer service at the outlet reminded me of a K-Mart during a going out of Business sale.  Need I Say More?

To start off, I'm not a snob. When I go to a Subway, I do NOT expect the worlds best, or even middling sandwich. I DO however expect something edible. I've had subway sanwiches from coast to coast, and I can say without a doubt that from the service, to the finished product, this outlet serves stands out as the worst in every way, The bread tatsted sour, the meat tasted old, and they didnt put the correct toppings on, I was unable to direct them since they seemed to be in the middle of a rush, the fact that I was the only person there makes me think the rush was more to get a smoke break. Sometimes I crave a Spicy Italian sub, but this place really took the cravinging out of me. I've driven by oither subways, and debated, but the fact that this place took my money for 2 sandwiches that my wife and I couldnt eat more than 2 bites of, I even took the meat out and tried to see if I could eat just the meat... but couldnt, has made Subway a chain that it will be a long time till I risk another chance with.  Which is a shame, because for cheap eats, they have always been a decent value.  I wrote the customer service line, and got a prompt response from the main headquarters, but the local owner never responded, which lets me know where the problem is, or at least is a huge clue.

As a follow up, it's been long enough where I could have heard back from the owner, but haven't. However world headquarters returned my email with a call, and gave me the list of shops in Arizona this man owns. I will be avoiding them going forward..  1106 n gilbert mesa 1221 s gilbert mesa 3550 esouthern 6140 w chandler blvd 1900 w chandler 1561 n cooper rd gilbert 876 mcqueen gilbert

This was one of the purest culinary experiences I've ever had. I find myself wanting to write paragraphs to explain my experiences dining here. Instead I believe I'm going to just keep it short. I've eaten from here twice, each time had the same level of quality. And I can say that up to this point in my life Geno's is the worst pizza I've ever had in my life.  I'm far from a food snob, but I do not say that lightly, I've had some bad pie in my life, and I can confidently state this was among the worst anyone could ever hope they avoid.  Crust.. I've heard it said as a joke before, but it actually DID have the consistency of the cardboard of a pizza box!  Toppings... each pie had some on them, none offensive, but no real flavor addition. Cheese... again, I'll say this, the entire pie had a coating of it, but it was strangely non-stringy, and had no real texture, it was seriously, the worst cheese ever.   If you're in Gilbert, and desperate for dough with stuff on it, better to get a Tombstone pizza, or go deluxe and gourmet compared to Geno's and order Hungry Howies, Pizza Hut or Domino's.  Actually, as local delivery in the area goes, though slightly overpriced, I like New York Pizza Department, it's far from the best Pizza in the world, but I confess a real fondness for their calzones. But that's another review for another place.  But trust me, better to eat your own foot than a pizza from Geno's Pizza! (OK, this wasn't that short! But you've been warned.)

One star for fear, two star for hope. Tried to call and see the status so i may be able to go out tonight.  Got a automated voice asking me to enter the Buisinesses                                                                                             number over and over  \  But without hope... whats the point? I do so hope it was a glitch, and that it returned, Yes, the location was poor. and perhaps that's the problem, but the solution in sound,k and good food for a reasonable $$ for what you get. I bet if they delivered they would have broken even, if that was the problem. One taste of Broasters and The dear Harland David "Colonel" Sanders would do the honorable thing and shoot himself and  admit defeat  (still.love a well ruin Popeye's , alas, there's one or two in the state all others are dressed up Churchs bland and yech, while a few still cook with precision and love, its just so rare                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            and I was really on a quest for something different to deliver on the ceap by southern  and Val Vista and this let me down this rabbithole!   And just don't I come across as a terror Mayo clinic has been testing cancer related offshoots that seem to make concentration difficult     so this is actually "doing good?) hrm... I wasnt like this before... but I trust themn.And I'm breathing, ans have children who worship me as I do tham   Yaknow what I want to,do, and this sounds insane, I want tl lr=earn to make cheese, I kn very little about iy=t other than the jou I get at cheese tastings,, evertyone else likes the wine,,, I love the decades raising/growing cheese    so I'm actually probably insane, even though my grandkids love meand want to helpfirst things first i guess.   No any good cheese tastings for beguiners around here?   Thanks

(I made a mistake and posted this to another location, caught this as I was writing a followup, so I erased my original review, reposting it here, and am posting a followup, so sorry if it looks a bit weird. I promise I'll pay closer attention going forward!)   How long has it been since I've felt more than "meh" about a Subway? Cant remember, there was one in Gilbert that was OK, but other than that, my experience with them as a chain has been so-so and in Arizona mostly wretched. With one, "Worst in Class" experience mixed in.  But after a long day of having my life saved at Mayo Clinic, I was a tad peckish, and we decided on a sandwich. Driving through Fountain Hills we decided that giving Subway there would be a reasonable gamble.   This location w as a complete delight.  CLEAN SUPER CLEAN! Nice! I was greeted when I walked in, and the one women working behind the counter apologized and said she would be with me as soon as her current customer was finished.  As I waited, I looked at the food in the bins behind the glass and .. they were all appetizing looking! This was a first in a decade or more for me! Nice, neat, this is a store that is run by someone with personal pride.  When my turn came, my wife ordered a steak & cheese w/extra meat, and I went for a Spicy Italian extra meat and cheese. (Its a heck of a value, and for us, 2-3 meals per sandwich)  My wife was happy with her food, I was struck by things that are missing everywhere else.  I never want to be a hassle so don't ask for it, but this woman separated the slices of meat on my sandwich, which makes a big difference in the texture of the sandwich, and nobody does.  All this, and the store was only staffed with one person is astounding. Sadly, labor costs are eternal, no matter the business.  The toppings were crisp, and the service was spot on perfect, the place, immaculate.. yes, it's a Subway, but within the world of Subways.. it's Iron Chef Subway. And I respect that.  If I get a hunger for it again, there is only one Subway that will do, I live 2 blocks from the worst sandwich shop we have ever eaten at which also happens to be a Subway. (and after a respectful letter of feedback , we never heard back from the owner) And to get to this one, we drive by countless subways and other places. But nothing beats the taste that comes from a restaurant run with personal pride, and a real aim towards excellence.  As I reread this it sounds impossible, and like I'm going on to long about it, but please believe me, its because my expectations and experiences have been so extremely low about this chain, I would always have chosen McDonald's or some drive through  over Subway based on Arizona experiences! This location makes a value oriented sandwich the way it should be.   I love a great sandwich, and will pay a pretty penny for one, Does this take the place of Duck and Decanter?   Lets be real, no way, but, for a $5 Italian Spicy Sub?  This Subway can be proud, Has ample parking, at least two nice staff folks (one lady was there working, another was just coming on) And even though I believed everything to be prefab, the ingredients were as fresh as could be,  On recommendation, I tried spinach instead of lettuce on my sub and it really was a good flavor that worked very well.

Had my first experience here yesterday, and the first thing I noticed was that everyone seemed to be enjoying their job. The folks behind the line were chatting and smiling (with each other and customers)  while working as fast as the wind! (two things you rarely see happen at the same time) Being a first timer, the fellow taking my order helped me out a bit, We went for a #5 Vito (Italian)  #9 Italian Night Club  and a Gargantuan (tons of different meats all double amount, it's 2-3 meals in one bun!)   What distinguishes JJ' to me is that everything tastes so fresh. The meats and cheese taste like they were just sliced, not sliced days before and vacuum packed.  And I know the bread at Subway is baked fresh, but this bread just tastes fresher and better. I thought I would miss the extra flavors and such subway offers but I didn't. Quality ingredients really shined through.  I had them put extra vinaigrette and hot peppers (not really that hot) to add a little depth of flavor, and it was far from over soggy, but worked out just right. Is this the best sub I've ever had in my life? Nope, but at a average of $6 apiece it's a surprise and best Bang For Buck sub I've ever had. And it IS one of the freshest tasting subs I've had in recent memory. They also will deliver just one sub, most places have a $10 minimum, how refreshing is that? As to complaints about the music, I found the music to be no louder than most places. Quieter than 5 Guys, MUCH louder than Village Inn.

As far as hooters go its pretty good. One of my guilty pleasures, and one that i rarely allow myself to indulge in is wings, (I worked hard to lose weight yaknow! So I enjoy my vices in moderation) The flavor was as good as other locations, the service was steller, everything was just fine, just trashy enough to be a Hooters, but not so overboard as to make me uncomfortable.  But the wings, one proud, juicy and huge, were now average sized, and they seemed to skimp on the sauce in order to sell containers of additional sauce on the side. , and not just the blue cheese, i mean the flavoring.... all in all, it was good quality, but cutting corners like this while still charging premium prices makes me wonder how long this location will remain open.  Is this what happened to Superstition Springs?

The space, Sparce, with a counter for taking orders and some outdoor seating and indoor seating. A few obligatory tourist posters are on the wall, as well as a TV blaring Fox news at a slightly higher volume than I would like. Not ear splitting, but it was pretty loud.  But the main thing, is the food.  Sad to say, it was pretty run of the mill, and even though it's only their first week open, I'm still not holding out a lot of hope. I ordered a Gyro Plate and The Bride ordered a falafel plate. The gyro meat tasted like any I could have had at numerous food courts in any mall across the country. the cries were nice, and the pita bread was fresh. the one weird thing was that even though it came with a salad, and the salad had a little bit of feta (I forgot to ask for extra feta, since i love the stuff!) there was NO DRESSING on either of our salads, its almost as if.. well, greek salads didnt need dressing here or something, very odd.  My Brides Falafel was better, not much better than a boxed mix you can get at Fry's, but still a decent portion, and it tasted fine. Her hummus tasted fine, about the same as you can get at Costco, but with a bit more lemon than I like. (personal preference here) I might go back in a month or so and see how their Kabobs are, though the whole meal tasted rather pre-fab which breaks my heart. I was so looking forward to a good Mom and Pop gyro place close by.  The portions were nice though, and the people were friendly.  Perhaps given time they will improve. Currently they don't deliver, and to me, that's really their only hope for survival with so many apartments in the area. Hope others have better experiences!

Perhaps the were just having a bad day based on everyone else. In my case, my wife picked up two gyro plates, one side of fried mushrooms and another of fried jalepenos. First, both sides tasted like the prefab ones they sell at grocery stores, or sysco foods. Not terrible, just nothing that I enjoy. The gyro meat is fine, althou if your like me, you prefer a bit of a chared taste as proof that fire was involved somewhere, I would have been happy if they had just given my slices a nice, quick sear in a pan before putting then in the box.  They give a whole lot of rice for the amount of meat, really gets your hopes up with you open the lid and then is a letdown when its well over 60% rice puffing up everything else.  What I REALLY disliked, REALLY, is no TZATIKI sauce and NO FETA, but what is obviously some offbrand ranch dressing in containers.  I admit, that last fact almost made me give them one star, I'm just assuming it was an accidnt. And if I go back, I'll be sure and ask for them on the platter and with the side salad.   Man its sad, I really was hoping for a good experience, I mean the man and the boy there were very nice. which goes a long way with me.

Cars in the shop, so discovering local cheap delivery joints.   First off, I have to subtract stars for charging $3.50 "delivery fee" That money should be the tip that goes to the driver, and is just a dishonorable way of sneaking extra cash into the bill.  The food.., xl=18" w 3 toppings and parm bread sticks (pizza crust with parm cheese on it,) For $15 w/coupon it was what I expected, although the people seem nice, delivery fast, modest amount of cheese on the pizza, reasonable everything else except one of my toppings was onions and I can tell you that was a waste!  Which is stupid, its the cheapest topping I requested! load it up a little, sheesh. The second time we ordered I asked if I could pay a buck and get some cheese on the cheese sticks, they said sure and while it didn't make it good, it made it better.  I respect them trying to service at a low price point, and yes, I've had worse, it's delivered fast fresh and friendly, which means a lot.  But that delivery charge (which I know was started by a chain) is just so maddening, and an insult to the drivers.

When we first moved here, this was the to go place for delivery. Sadly, perhaps due to a a lack of real competition beyoyond pizza, they seem increasingingly overwhelmed, slow of service, and losing whatevever communication skills they had before. The foood alll seems rushed with no depth, and It just makes me sad. Our house loved ordering from a small local place, it's our favororite lazy in home treat. But 3 hours for a mediocre meal, where some things might be wrong... they might be a victim of their own success and need to hire more preople, I want to use them for years to come, but it's not looking great at this point.
