Food was average but the service was terrible!  Waitress seemed totally put out at our presence and even hung her purse on a chair at a table next to ours seemingly to imply she was ready to leave but we had fouled that up by walking in.  We asked only 3 questions and were met with curt responses.  I ordered a stuffed burger and swapped my fries for the twice baked potato and still was charged the full price for the damned thing.  So my burger and potato came out to over 15 bucks with taxes and they refused to give me credit for the fries that I traded in... never again...

Had them put a clear bra on a dodge ram after calling around and finding they had the best price and a 7 yr warranty vs the 5 year that everyone else offered.  While installing, they found some small orange paint spray on my hood that they could not clean off before installation and called and told me so.  They were willing to take it over to the car wash and have them clay bar it off so I could get the best result possible.  While I wish the clear film wrapped under the hood for complete coverage, I can't complain with the price, a 7 yr warranty, or the extra time they took to get my car clayed and have the job done right.  Would strongly recommend!

This was the 4th Mexican Food place we tried on the west side after moving here and we have been coming back ever since.  Good chips and salsa with bean dip.  New Mexican entrees and traditional Mexican dishes as well.  Good service and a nice big dining area.

I saw their advertised 24.99 no contract, new customer offer and had them go spray my mom's house.  I was curious to see what 25 bucks would get for an elderly lady living in an old 4,000 sq ft house on a 1/3 of an acre covered in 3 foot weeds.  I left after an hour and then called my mom an hour later and they were still there!  They stuck it out, did all 7 of their steps, and 15 gallons of spray and 2 hours later; they presented my mom with a bill for 24.99 with no pressure to sign a contract.  After having bad experiences with other pest control companies, my mom was so pleased, she tipped the guy more than the actual bill.  I decided to try them myself and was equally impressed at how thorough of a job they do compared to the quick "15 minute - pay and I'll spray" service I had become accustomed to.  2 happy customers so far!
