This place has fabulous food and excellent service. Every time I have ordered carry out it is ready within 10 minutes. The portions are big and there is a wide variety of food options on their menu. I really like how friendly they are to their customers!

They have the worst pizza and wings I have ever had in my life. I had asked for mild sauce for the wings and they arrived without any sauce. The wings were soaked in grease and tasted horrible. The pizza dough was very doughy and flavorless. I would not recommend anybody order food from this location.
