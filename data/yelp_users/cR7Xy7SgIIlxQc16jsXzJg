Like someone else said...you really need to expect Riazzi's to be what it is to enjoy it. Is this place outdated? Yes. Is the salad a little meh? Yes. And what's the deal with their ranch? It is SO watery. But their bread is awesome! And the Veal Piccata is to DIE FOR. Im somewhat of a Piccata freak considering I make it for dinner frequently and order it almost every time I go to an Italian place (chicken or veal). I have not had a better Veal Piccatta anywhere. So for that I will keep coming here when I am in the mood for a delicious Veal Piccata.

Went here for lunch today..not bad. Like everyone else says its not super nice and a little slow. But the Chimichanga I had was good (nice and crispy but not dripping with grease) and it was cheap. We were able to go here for lunch and be back within an hour. I liked it and will be back!

This local nail salon has been around for about 10 years (maybe more) right next to my parents house. The owners are John and Tammy and they are super friendly. My whole family (even Dad!) goes there for mani/pedi/wax. If you are going to go try to request John / Tony / Tammy and Kandy because they absolutely do the best nails at this place. EM does awesome pedicures. Tammy has also been waxing my eye brows for as long as I can remember. I really like coming here because I feel like its clean and they are also VERY friendly. They talk to you and even wave if you are just walking by to go to the grocery store next door. Their prices are a a teensy bit higher than other non-spa like nail places but, I am fine with paying their prices because they know my name and I feel like I know what im getting when I go there. I love OH! Nails :)

I am only rating this against other hole-in-the-wall chinese places and this is about as good as it gets! Not much by way of ambiance and the day I went there they didnt have a/c (dont know if it is all the time or it was just out?) but the food was delish/cheap/ and close to my work! You just cant beat a $4.75 lunch special! MMMMMM

Best breakfast burrito in the valley. I have been here dozens of times since I have lived down the street forever and it is an old favorite. You will not be disappointed.

I wish I could give this place zero stars. Horrific customer service, long waits, and I seriously HATED the Dr rotation. I had my first child at G&P because it was close to my house (HAHAHAHAHA) and after I had her, I swore I would never go back and I haven't. They make you wait in the room for like an hour every time to visit just for someone to measure your stomach and ft your blood pressure! Bro, I could do that stuff myself and record it for you. I had a total stranger deliver my daughter... AWESOME. NOT. After I had her, I switched the Dr Huish at University OBGYN and he is AMAZING. I will tell everyone I know to stay far away from here.

I LOVE Healing Hearts. When I found out I was pregnant I selected this practice on a recommendation from a friend who takes her children there and I knew if they were good enough for her that I would probably love them. WOW! I could not have been more right! I know a mom on here said that they only go to Chandler Regional...however, I had my daughter in the middle of the night on a Saturday at Mercy Gilbert and the very next morning (bright and early on a Sunday) Dr. Wilcock came to check her out. She was so so very kind and she seems to genuinely care about the kids she takes care of. My daughter is now 18 months and we still see Dr. Wilcock for everything! We love Healing Hearts and Dr. Wilcock!

My favorite spot in Gilbert for Chinese! It's always fresh and hot. We love the Chow Mein and General Tso's chicken! It is never too crowded and we can get right in for an easy family dinner. Love this place!

I love this dry cleaners. They are always EXTREMELY friendly. Remember my name and even help me to my car when I have lots of stuff. On top of that, they do an EXCELLENT job with my clothes. I have not only had stuff dry cleaned but a zipper repaired (maybe $6 bucks??) and a hem altered. All of it is great work. It is family owned and that makes me happy to give them my business. As long as I live in Gilbert this is where im taking my dry cleaning.

This company was dispatched to my house from our home warranty company. Took two days to get on the schedule and they come out and "fix it" and yeah...still not fixed and it's supposed to be 117 today. I AM NOT HAPPY.

Overrated. Food is meh. Expensive for what you get. Nothing has ever really impressed me. I feel like both of the other "Joe's" establishments are way better (Joe's real BBQ & Liberty Market) - I'd rather go to those any day.

I really love me some cupcakes. So when I found out this joint was serving cupcakes made by winners from cupcake wars - I was like HELL YES. So were they nice looking cupcakes? Yes. But you know they were just not that tasty at all. kind of dry. I got a coconut and got the birthday cake for my daughter since we were sampling to possibly purchase for her birthday party. I really wanted to love them. But I didnt. I might go back for some coffee but for the mean time im sticking to Sprinkles for my cupcakes.

Oh, Sprinkles...you have won my cupcake heart. I first went to Sprinkles in Newport (I think?) a few years ago...and from that day on I was hooked. Then I was  stoked when they opened in Scottsdale! Sometimes I go visit the husband at work just to stop by Sprinkles. I also had Sprinkles cupcakes at my wedding instead of a traditional cake and I couldnt be happier. I just love these cupcakes. I dont know what else to say. I have had A LOT of flavors but I really really love the Black and White. That is my most favorite/ go to cupcake. I have tried other cupcakes place and they are just...imposters.

I LoveLoveLove Dutch Bros! I was always a loyal Starbucks customer until this little gem popped up right next to my work :) Like everyone else says their drinks are delish (medium iced non fat sugar free white choc mocha mmmmmmm) and they are so friendly! I normally just walk up because its never crowded and super fast! Love it! and I love my punch card!! Dutch Bros is awesome! :)

I took my car to the location on at Tempe Marketplace today around 1pm... and I am very displeased with the service I received. When I first pulled up there were cars ahead of me which is fine but there was a guy wearing a "customer service" shirt just standing there (leaning up against a gas pump) not doing anything. After I pulled up and sat there he made no effort to come see what I needed or if I had been helped. After a few minutes another car pulled up next to me (closer to where he was standing) and he walked over there and helped them before I was serviced even though I was there first. I dont know if they are only suspposed to help designated "lanes" but I found this very rude. After I had to wait a few more minutes FINALLY another person came out and helped me. After waiting 40 minutes for my car wash to be done (since when does it take so long really?) they finally called me and I get in my car expecting it to smell fresh and clean..however, it smelled like vinegar and a sweaty person that probably just been cleaning it. It appears they have forgot my air freshener...I dont have time to discuss this because my lunch is over and now I need to get back to work. But, I am very displeased. I had poor customer service to start, a long wait for my car and then it smelled awful. Long story shot, it looks okay on the outside but I am going to need to freshen up the inside. Yay. Ugh.

MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE PIZZA. Hands down. I am not much of a marinara fan so I LOOOOOOOOVE the White Pizza w/ Pepperoni! MM MMMM MMMMM We live right next to San Tan so we come to this one frequently and also do take out. I have been to the one's in Scottsdale and Ocotillo also and they are just as delish. On a weekend night there will be probably about a 30 minute wait so get ready for it. But they are always very nice and welcoming. I LOVE this pizza. I cant say it enough. I have never had a better pizza.

We frequent Carrabbas since it close to our house. I have never had to wait for a table more then about 15 minutes and that was on a busy Friday night. Everyone is always very polite. I always get the Veal Piccatta because.. well I love it. It comes with garlic mashed potatoes that are soooo good. Their bread and oil for dipping are also splendid! MMM - They also have a very good Parmesean dressing for salads that my daughter puts away by the handful (she is 2 haha!) All in all it is a moderately priced, delicious, quick meal which is very important when you have a 2 year old :)

I think El Palacio gets the shaft here on Yelp. I have been here a few times and every time they have been super nice, i've had quick service and great food. It's always hot and exactly what I asked for. I've never had a problem and they even have given us free dessert twice! Im a fan and will keep going back!

Rigatony's is a staple in my family. Since they have moved locations it has been busier and little longer wait..but it is definitly worth it!! At their old location it was so hard to park and in the middle of downtown Chandler which I personally hate driving through..so when when we found out they were moving we were pelased. In Danielle T's review she said it was a chain and it definitly is not..it is a family owned restuarant here in AZ. Anyways...they bring out Amazzzzzzzzing bread and salad to start! Just the way we like to start our meal :) I always get the Veal with Lemon and Artichokes which is just TO DIE FOR! I always want to venture out but can't ever manage to make myself do so. The husband always orders the Baked Rigatony w/Sausage and he loves it also! The house Chianti is also delicious according to the husband...I dont know though since I dont like red wine. I dont know how anyone could ever say this place is lower quality than Olive Garden? I really feel like she had no place or point of view to be writing that. Rigatony's is AWESOME and we will keep going back :) :)

I have been here twice now..and both times it was delish! The first go around I got the Carne Quesadilla and today I got the Carne Burrito. Both were excellent. Their meat is SO much better then many other chain fast food Mexican places because they actually cook it on what appears to be a very large grill! Their regular sized burritos are not huge but that is fine with me because I will pay for quality over quantity anyday. I will keep going back :)

So, I tried to go here last night with my mother and daughter...we walk in and its 5:45 on Tuesday. Yes, there were people eating but there were also plenty of open tables. The hostess asks if we have a reservation and I let her know that we do not as its a TUESDAY (not really prime eating out day..) and its 5:45! She then informs me that they are totally booked for the evening with reservations. So, I really felt like she didnt care that we were here to spend our money and I felt like she was rude. She offered no help nor did she even try to accomodate us. That's fine by me...we just went to The Keg and spent our money there :) Which by the way was DELICIOUS and I will NOT be going back to DC.

I was thrilled when I discovered this place at the mall RIGHT NEXT TO MY HOUSE. I finally went in a few weeks ago and got a cupcake seeing how I absolutely love cupcakes. And it was just meh. It was huge. But it was dry and I was just in love with it the way I wanted it to be. Maybe because it was a week day mid day...it had been sitting for a while. Maybe next time im at the mall I will stop in and try them again but for now...2 stars. Huge cupcakes but it was definitely dry.

I had been wanting to get to Arrogant Butcher for a while and finally ended up here on Saturday night. First let me say, we were about 20 minutes late for our reservation and they got us in RIGHT AWAY. No complaints here. I was fairly shocked that they were able to accomodate that..very pleasantly surprised. Next, our waiter (I wish I could recall his name...) was seriously EXCELLENT. We told him we had never been here before and he told us all about the menu, what he recommends..etc. He was very prompt and attentive..always made sure our glasses were full and we were happy. I have nothing bad to say about him :) So we ordered chicken fingers for my daughter (I know this is not a kid friendly place but we were headed downtown to suffer through Disney On Ice for her so this was the least she could do for us..right?!!) and they were SO GOOD. Their batter was nothing like other chicken strips...I would definitely get these next time I am here. My mother in law got the Sweet Potato Tortellini which she loved..she did say it was a small portion for what it costs but she enjoys small portions so this was no big deal to her. My husband got the Chicken Stroganoff, he said it was "good" not great but "good". Now, I got the daily sepcial which was the Prime Rib...I ordered it Medium Rare which it definitely was and I can not complain about that...however, not only was my PR not warm..my scalloped potatoes were barely even lukewarm. So, I get that Medium rare PR will not be hot but my potatoes...it felt like mine was sitting under a lamp for a long time waiting for my 2 yr old's chicken fingers to be done since they were inedible for about 10 minutes. All in all, I would say we were pretty pleased by the restaurant. It is very cool inside and had a great feel. I dont know that my PR was worth the $25 it cost. But, I would come back to sit at the bar and have a drink/apps with the husband minus the two year old :)

Let me start by saying if I could give it NO stars then I would have done that. Moving on to the review.... So my coworkers and I head here for lunch today..go in check out the menu which is quite small and limiting but whatever..decide to order a bacon breakfast burrito..go up to counter and ask if it has potatoes in it.. the girl replies with yes and I say "okay good" order my burrito/ drink (side bar -- they have their drinks behind the counter and I had to wait for the girl to finish taking the rest of lines order to get my drink..annoying but okay). The three people im with all order AFTER me and then ALL get their food. Im waiting..waiting.. after about 10 ish minutes and my friends PLUS all the people after me getting their food I go up and ask where my burrito is...they all look around at each other and are like "ummmm we accidentally gave it to a car in the drive thru" so my first thought is...IF YOU REALIZE THIS WHY DIDNT YOU MAKE ANOTHER ONE!? Whatever. The worst is yet to come. Get my burrito..yes, its piping hot. So I take a bite..hmm no potatoes and by being the freak I am; I then decide to open it up and look...nope, no potatoes. Roll it back up and decide to eat it because im starving. Well after about 2 bites grease just comes POURING out..im not talking a little bit a grease..a TON of it!! I have ate at Filly's/ Los Favoritos/Someburros all these kind of places and NEVER HAVE EVER ON ANYTHING experienced SO MUCH GREASE. I put down the burrito and my hands were covered in grease, my napkins, plate. Too disgusting to eat. So by now all my friends are done anyways and I just threw it away. It was only 5 bucks...but they will never get my 5 bucks again. Also, I was talking to a seperate co-worker on my way out of the office about this place and she said there was one by her house but it closed down! Should have taken it as a sign......... NEVER AGAIN! Another thing, if you were wondering......my other friends that did not have my experience got rolled tacos, tacos and a torta.. the general consensus was that it was meh. Not worth going back for.

This place has seriously yummy shaved ice! I am currently 7 months pregnant and have been coming here all winter to satisfy my shaved ice craving that comes about every 3 days LOL! At first, it was just a substitute for my old favorite , the BB word (we wont mention them) but! There are now a few reasons I like this place more: the most important reason being that they are open on Sundays! I get it, family time, but I WANT MY SHAVED ICE ON SUNDAYS! Also, they put a lot more syrup on their shaved ice which is soooo yummy. I also agree that their iced is finer. All in all, it's my new fav :)

I disagree with both of the negative reviews posted here. My four year old has been dancing here for a year and I love this place! Our first time coming in the owner helped us and she was so sweet, she explained the different combo classes and helped us pick which one would be best for my princess (DCTutu's - a performance group for smaller children). From day 1 this studio has been more organized than a lot of other studios and we have experience as I danced as a child/teen and my daughter did one year at another studio that really was AWFUL. The first reviewer says that the receptionist repeatedly told her it is the end of the semester and she did that because at the end the kids are not learning anything new they are simply prepping dances they have worked on for 6 months for the June recital, so it would be really pointless to throw a random kid in that room and have them learn nothing and mess with the dynamic right before recital would be not good for all the other students. My daughters teacher was amazing with small children and we will be so sad to move out of her class next year. We love it here and plan I make it our dance home :)

This food truck came to my office today for lunch. I got the tri-tip sandwich - it was okay, the meat was a little rare for my liking, I wish I would have known just how pink it was before I ordered, as I would have make a different selection. Also, we waited 50 MINUTES FOR EVERYONE IN OUR GROUP TO GET OUR FOOD! That is just absolutely ABSURD for a food truck! Plus, my sandwich was $11 no side or drink. While the sandwich, was decent..it was not worth a minute 50 min wait or $11.

Literally THE WORST service I have ever had. Ordered our food 55 minutes ago. At this rate, I will never ever be back. I do not care how good it is once it arrives. You have pissed me and both of my children off.  Edit: had to ask TWICE to see the manager. She was completely worthless. I WILL NEVER BE BACK.

Was told a 20 min wait. Has now been over an hour. They're apologetic but it doesn't help when your cranky one year old wants to run in the street constantly. So far, I'm NOT impressed.
