They've fixed both my mom's car and mine, their prices are always reasonable, they're very courteous and the cars always come back fixed without any "surprise" problems.  I recommend this place 100% should you ever have a problem passing emissions testing.

This little hole in the wall has one tiny but powerfully delicious kitchen that brings out the best Pupusas I have ever tasted in my life..  the food is hot, freshly cooked and packed with so much flavor, the prices are so low that I feel if they raised the prices slightly and kept the same amazing customer service and fantastic kitchen work they could easily get a well deserved bigger and more contemporary place.  Regardless of the size, this place is wonderful, it's clean and the staff is so friendly and the food .. I just can't stop saying how delicious the food here is.      If you want to impress someone with a non pretentious hole in the wall wonder then this is the delicious place to introduce someone to their first most amazing Pupusa!

Although inept, the staff was friendly, went there as part of a reservation for a large party and they were completely unprepared even though the event was at 1pm in the afternoon on a wednesday.  the food took about 2 hours to get there, everything about this experience was disappointing and flavorless.     the food was overpriced, ridiculously (hours) late, cold, under-portioned and flavorless, I had the crap cold cheese covered oatmeal vomit looking tuscan farro risotto with crispy (more like effing burnt) prosciutto (i imagine cheese covered oatmeal vomit actually has more flavor than this crap dish). I've had water with more flavor than the green tea I ordered. the staff missed or got multiple orders wrong, some never came at all. I would have understood if this was because we may have just appeared being a large party and the restaurant had been slammed, BUT we had made reservations AND we were the only people there for that entire time (now we know why, probably because it sucks and we didn't get the memo)    there was no excuse for them to be so flakey, unfocused and disappointing, for the price of the food I would have been happy if at least the food came to me hot (or at least warm) within a normal period of wait (not over an hour and a half or more) and with some flavor. but no.. I paid 30 bucks (I tipped 20% cuz i'm not an asshole like the cook at this place even though the service sucked, however I later found it it came to be actually about 40% because the gratuity had already been added to my bill but I didn't read the damn fine print because I had already been at that restaurant for a total of 3 hours doing nothing but nibbling on some burnt toast with cherry tomatoes and piss green tea and wanted to get the hell out of there ASAP.  don't recommend this place to anyone..  here is a link to the picture of my vomit looking risotto  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v621/PolarCap25/184267_173964032649482_100001076585043_383833_5796074_n.jpg

I love the happy hour here! The place is big enough answer the seating is very spacious, the food is always cooked great and delivered quickly to the table with that just out of the kitchen heat. Oh, and the burro wings and Hawaiian gone fishing appetizers are amazing as well as the drunken shrimp.  Hands down the best buffalo wings in town! So crispy and juicy with tons of flavor!    On Sundays it does get really loud cause of the games and the people cheering and the live band playing that you can't really hear yourself speak...  but hey that's just one day. And I don't need to chat when I'm devouring the yummy wings anyways!  Also the staff is always very kind and prompt! Kudos to the great team this location has!

East Valley Family Medical is a joke, the wait time is hours (one time I waited 4 hours after my appointment time to finally be seen by doctor). The doctors are rushed, they don't ask questions, don't listen, don't provide information. They act and groan and scoff like they're pissed they have to do their job. You wait hours to see a doctor and he sees you for 60 seconds. They're not gay friendly (or people friendly period). They don't do any refills over the phone of any kind under any circumstances, if you need a refill you need to make another appointment  AND they just increased their office visit fee from 50 to 65 bucks.   Not happy. Not even a little.

This place is worse than the IRS, at least the IRS admits when they made a mistake. But these arrogant workers will be caught dead before they hear themselves say "sorry for the inconvenience" or "we made a mistake".  They gave me different information on two consecutive visits that I made, then Dorrie, some lady who obviously should not have been working that day because she was coughing phlegm all over my documents, then after she asked me to wait by the counter for 10 minutes while their system updated.   I waited, 1 hour and 30 minutes later I finally went to the information counter and asked for Dorrie... I was told that she had gone to lunch 15 minutes ago and was told to go talk to another lady. She just dismissed me and I went to go talk to the new lady, who was also extremely rude and kept rolling her eyes and interrupting me before I could finish my sentences.  Basically i spent total of 3 and a half hours waiting and getting attitude and nothing was resolved because of their mis information and Dorries idiot customer service ethics and the last ladys pride..  not one person resolved anything and they all were too proud to say "we apologize for the inconvenice".  I recommend this place if you wanna be late to work 2 or more hours and having your mild mannered patience tested to the maximum.

Went to the Fiesta Mall location inside of the food court. John fixed my mom's laptop when all other places said it wasn't fixable. Sam repaired and soldered a new charger connector to my netbook when Best Buy said they could only fix it by removing the whole mother board and just to look at it they (Best Buy) would charge an extra $50 bucks on top of the repair that would cost almost as much as my $200 netbook.   This company always beats competitor prices for computer repairs and even for my phone screen repairs. They are professional, offer incredible personable customer service and swift repairs. I'm definitely going to continue being a customer of theirs and recommend their services to all my friends.
