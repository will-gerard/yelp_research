I contacted Price Busters in reference to a broken spa.  Bobby (the owner) and John went above and beyond with their customer service and assistance.  They both worked with me via telephone and when I came into the shop to help guide me with fixing the spa myself instead of spending hundreds of dollars on a repair-man.  They were very honest about the possible issues with my spa and encouraged me to fix it myself if I felt so inclined (which I did).  I recommend anyone that needs to fix a spa to speak with Price Busters before calling anyone else.

This body shop has gone above and beyond in the area of customer service as well as had repaired my vehicle to pristine condition on two separate occasions. Jeremy took time to always answer any questions I had and made sure I was updated regularly on the status of my car. I've since sent my family and several friends here any time they've needed body work done and each time Exclusive has done an outstanding job. I highly recommend this collision center and would never trust my vehicle to any other body shop.

I've been a member of ME for several years. Finding a competent and reliable therapist is hard! I recently moved and had to find a new therapist at a local ME. I started at the ME on Indian School and 32nd St with a therapist named Keisha (sp?). Not a good experience.. She was very repetitive with her hands and didn't focus on what I needed. It was robotic in nature and not pleasant. I decided to switch to the ME on 16th St and Camelback in hopes of finding a good therapist. I found one! LORI-ANN is her name and she is phenomenal. She takes the time to get to know her clients and what they need. She addresses muscular issues with focus, and treats you like an individual instead just another customer. She takes the time every session to ask me about how I'm feeling, what I've been doing, and asks how she can provide me with the best massage for health and wellness. She never just repeats hand motions during the massage; she actually switches up her techniques and tailors her massages to what I need to get the most benefit as possible. I highly highly highly recommend her!  On a separate note, I do wish this ME had stamp cards like the other MEs. It's huge incentive to schedule appointments when you know you'll get a stamp and free upgrades after a certain amount. Take note Camelback ME! Allow stamp cards like several of the other MEs!!

Overall I was not impressed.  I saw several great reviews and had high hopes and ended up very disappointed.  First, the use of space in this restaurant is atrocious.  Massive booths on the outside with entrance from either side of the booth, and half-moon tables with curved benches throughout the center portion of the restaurant.  They could have very easily made this a much more comfortable restaurant, however it appears they were more interested in a specific look versus functionality.  As far as the food goes, it was ok.  I had the Breakfast Burrito with chorizo and green chili sauce.  Very plain in flavor.  Sadly, I would say some of the local fast-food Mexican restaurants have much more flavorful breakfast burritos.  To be fair, I was with a large group and some of the group enjoyed their food more than me.  No one was overly impressed but some of them did feel their food and experience here was better than mine.

Often times people look through Yelp and see short reviews with 5 stars because it's always hard to write long positive reviews, but easy to write long negative reviews.  Every 5 star review of Urban Desert Pest Control is spot on.  I try to write all of my reviews as accurate and honest as possible.  I think it is important to dissect a company and give an accurate rating with a thorough explanation so consumers know what to expect from a person/ company and the type of people/company they are going to be involved with.  One of the most important aspects of a company is how they treat their customers.  Brad excels in every way with his customer service.  His actions epitomize what it means to go above and beyond for his customers.  Brad's communication skills and availability to his customers is unrivaled.  My personal situation involved a roof rat.  Not just any roof rat though.  This sucker found it's way into my dog food, my cabinets, my son's top bunk, my laundry, and our kids' toys.  I was on the verge of ordering a missile strike on my own home due to the problems and frustration this despicable rodent was causing my family.  I jumped on Yelp in search of "Exterminators" and actually messaged several companies.  The Yelp listing for Urban Desert Pest Control said, "Responds to quote requests in about 1 hour."  Well, this was WAY off because Brad called me within what felt like seconds of messaging him.  The initial phone call felt personal and Brad was genuinely interested in how he could help with my situation.  Throughout the entirety of the conversation, Brad focused on ME and MY PROBLEM, not how much he charged or his availability to assist me.  He stopped everything he was doing to address MY issue.  Now, it should be known I had pleasant conversations with other companies on Yelp, but Brad's communication skills, and his ability to make me feel "special" (hey, everyone likes some extra attention now and then), was why I stuck with Brad throughout the removal process.  It also helped that Brad convinced me to not follow through with a missile strike on my house.  I leave you with this, usually it is easy to find something negative to say about a person or company because 99% of the time there is at least ONE issue that arises.  Well, my situation fell in that 1%.  The cons to using Urban Desert Pest Control are as follows: 1. 2. 3.... NOPE, can't think of a single legitimate reason to NOT call and speak with Brad.  Brad gained a customer for life with our family.
