This by far is the best Vietnamese Restaurant! We live in North Scottsdale and are always down to make the drive for Cyclo. We haven't had anything we didn't like!   The owner is amazing and the rest if the team is super friendly as well.  Need suggestions?... The Pho is Amazing! Want to try something different?.. Go for the Fried Rice Cakes with seafood, veggies, and beef! To start be sure to order the Vietnamese Egg Rolls, Green Beans, and Black Bean Shrimp! We always end our meal with an iced Vietnamese coffee. Better than any others. And don't forget-- it's byob!

Amazing!! The best Italian I've found in the area. Everything is fresh and delicious. The restaurant is family owned and the service is great and genuine. You can also BYOB! Just don't forget cash as credit is not accepted.

Delicious and fresh! One of the best sushi places I've been to and the best in Scottsdale in my opinion. Hiro typically will be a busy place so prepare with a reservation. If you get a seat at the sushi bar, the chef always has great picks and suggestions! Yum.

I love that Sprouts supports local farmers. They always have a great selection of fruit and veggies. Pricing is reasonable which is also a plus. My tip? Going early or going late in the day! This place can get busy!

Everyone was nice, but I probably won't return. The service was extremely slow. I don't think they were properly staffed.. My car sat for a good 15 minutes before someone took it through the wash. There didn't seem to be any kind of system for the employees as they were everywhere yet unproductive in my opinion. As a side note; I came on a Sunday, and no one was in line..

Not a huge fan. It wasn't super flavorful and I felt it was a bit too greasy. I think there are def. better options. I also saw this microwave as previously mentioned..?!?

As a first timer, this was good for lunch. Nothing fancy, but the food was hot and yummy.   A side note; the fish in the fish tank creep me out. They are Huge and way too large to enjoy life in the small tank... Just saying.

While I'm not a huge fan of the massages.. The facials are hands down the best around! I love that they use organic products, explain without trying to sell, and allow you to relax and enjoy! Of course the steam room is amazing as well! Great facility with a lot to offer!

It really is delish! You can't go wrong with any option! Highly recommend! I love that breakfast is served all day. The line and the parking lot can be a bit frustrating at times, but that's just an indicator of a busy time and a great place to dine.

Our golden retriever loves it here! We use Belly Rubz' doggy daycare. Each time they welcome our dog with a smile and know him by name. The staff is super friendly and you can tell they spend their day interacting with the dogs. Our dog is always super happy when arriving and tired and wore out when we leave!

So glad this place is right around the corner from me!The Pho is delicious as well as the egg rolls! Not in the mood to dine in? The take out is fresh and hot! Sometimes, it's even better than dining in just to be in the comfy, cozy atmosphere of home.

Probably some of the best massages I've had. While there is some turnover-- They are always on time, consistent, and of course relaxing and they listen to what you are looking for. The consistency doesn't change even with new team members. They also have great pricing and the feel of a spa!

This is my new fav. Grocery. Fresh produce, amazing selection of meats, seafood and poultry. The service has always been good and the place is always clean. Some items can be pricey-- and some defiantly worth it!

Several years ago I would frequent Red House almost weekly for lunch.. Dine in or take out as it was close to my work location. At that time, it was good. It seemed fresh and hot to order.  I was sad to visit today to find the opposite. I walked in to dine and there were no lights on, the restaurant was dirty.. Ceiling leak stains, dust from the ceiling, etc. The service was not friendly and the food was far from fresh. The only items that were "fresh" were those that were hot from coming out of the deep fryer.   Needless to say, I will not be returning..

Love the grill-- so many options, although limited hours. The desert, salad bar, iced tea, and sushi is delish! I wouldn't splurge on the pre-made warm dinners -- they can be dry and flavorless at times. Good selection of wine/beer as well!

As a first timer, the food was good and the customer service was great!! On a side note, there was no ice in the soda machine.. And they were out of their baklava before 2pm. . Which seems odd. Either way, good food!

This place gets five stars for the customer service alone! They are always on point, happy and friendly. The service is quick and the espresso beverages are quite delicious. Try the Iced Cocomo.. Add an extra shot!

I was a little nervous to do airbrush as to the results I would get...now, I love it! They did a fabulous job. It was quick and comfortable! I was a little unsure about the amount i saw coming off in the shower; however, it's fine now. We'll see how long the tan lasts! Very cute boutique.

I've enjoyed coming to this salon for over a year. Great service and never disappointed with the results. I always have to plan to be there for about an hour and a half to two hours when doing a pedi and gel Mani, other than that, quite relaxing.

Great service! I called at 7:30am and he was here within two hours. While the job wasn't super difficult or an emergency- it was something I needed completed with my husband out of town and a leaking/broken toilet valve.   He quoted a price over the phone and stuck to it. He was friendly, professional, and we would definitely use him for the future.

Yum! The food is great, the restaurant is clean and the team was friendly and quick! The menu provides various options and being close to work is a plus as well. I highly recommend the Picado Pita.. Your traditional gyro with a kick of jalape√±o!

I enjoy this place-- I have eaten there as well as taken out.  While the sushi isn't the Best sushi I have ever had.. It's good and very reasonable. I also like the portion size so you can try various rolls! It always seems very fresh and they are always friendly.

After reading reviews on Yelp, I decided to give them a try. Using Yelp I placed an order-- which connects you to the EAT24 app. I was able to view the whole menu and pay online. Loved this feature!  My food arrived within the suggested time. For Chinese takeout, it's pretty good! I had the Hunan Chicken and an Egg Roll.

Love this place! Both locations are great and the staff is super friendly. They are reasonably priced, have a lot of options, and the salon is super clean! Feeling like a cocktail while you are getting your nails done? Try their Scottsdale Road and Indian Bend location!

Bad Customer Service! My mother in law rented a car from here. After picking it up and driving a bit, the AC wasn't working..{In the 115 AZ Summer weather}. When she told them she was told to go next door to Midas to have it looked at. She did (which shouldn't be her responsibility) they confirmed it didn't work. They then told her they didn't have any cars and would need to either take a truck or go to another location 30 minutes away.. What made this worse is the rep was not friendly and not professional. He was rude and unhelpful.

This is a great spot! They have a great selection of beer and burgers. I've also had some other sandwich items and they've always been great. Our experience with service has always been friendly and we probably come once a week since we live so close! I would defiantly recommend. Looking to try something new? Try the Bacon PB &J burger. ;) yum!
