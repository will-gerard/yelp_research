This place is great, i had trouble with my amp and was super frustrated. I went in and the guys were nice enough to come out and diagnose with me for almost nothing. This is for sure where i will go in the future. Great guys definatley not a anothtrashy audio place.

If your looking for somewhere authentic and feels like a mom and pops type establishment, come check this place out. The prices are crazy low and the food is tasty. New bar which has sake bombs for 5 dollars

I had really avoided this place but figured i would take a risk and consider it.   I walked into the leasing office to get some help and arrived at the same time as a current resident who began to ask for repairs of basically everything in her apartment. as   i mentioned that her place was falling apart jokingly and let her know i was thinking of possibly signing a lease,  a pasty kid working with her boomed in and stated "we actually dont have room". I looked at him confused  considering he didnt know what i was looking for or when i would need the apartment. i asked him if the entire complex was booked, this pledge decided to respond with yes. I could tell he was being short and just plain not interested in helping so i walked out.   A place that hires talent like that gives you a window into how they are managed and how theyll treat you as a resident.   As far as the kid he wasnt worth the sweat i built between my taint from my car to the leasing office.

This was my favorite place as I am a resident next door, I went to get food about 20 minutes ago 930 and was denied service. The bouncer a large African American called me a spick and told me to leave. He wouldn't let me out the back so I ran and he pushed a female we were with just to prevent me from doing so . I went from wanting to work here to wanting to come a formal complaint.  I have video of this and will be uploading to you tube. I used to love the lodge at Scottsdale this is so shameful.  I went from wanting to do part time here to telling all Hispanics to stay away.  Man in black Polo in the video was  respectful and was understanding.  No reason to deny service for food smh.

Would leave less if I could.  The security here really freaks girls out any time we go, mostly the door guy and some guy named beast. Who introduces themselves like that??   Great location, awful staff.
