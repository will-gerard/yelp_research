One person staffed at 7:30 in the morning and a 20 minute wait for a smoothie? Come on TSC, you have to do better.

Great prices, awesome fresh sushi and a surprise dessert at the end of the meal! We'll be back to Masa soon!

We decided to head to Fate for lunch to celebrate my big 3-0 birthday, based on all of the positive Yelp reviews. I'm happy to report that it didn't disappoint. The beer, pizza and cake pops were all on point. Our server was friendly and super attentive, in fact we joked that she may have Psychic powers!! I would highly recommend Fate and will definitely return the next time were in Scottsdale!

Fogon is fo-real! Everything was on point, the ambiance, the drinks, appetizers, entrees and service. We started with the guacamole, it was by far the most flavorful restaurant guac we've ever had and for $10 you get a hearty portion. Drinks: we had the Patron Jalisco Mule and Spicy Watermelon Margarita, both were unique and tasty! Entrees: The stacked veggie quesadilla was extremely flavorful and there's a reason the chef won an award for the green chile pork!  We'll be back to Fogon as soon as possible! Do yourself a favor and give Fogon a try!
