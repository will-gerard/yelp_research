Have you ever been riding along and a place catches your eye and for whatever reason you can't stop but vow to return to that place one day? Mandy's was that place for me. Right off the light rail stop at 24th Street, I was continually passing it by on my commute from Mesa to Downtown Phoenix and back again.  When a friend of mine at work had yet to experience the light rail, I knew a perfect opportunity for her to ride it would be an excursion for lunch and Mandy's would be the ideal place for us to go. Believe me, Ms. Mandy did NOT dissapoint. Almost everything there is fresh and homemade.  The fish was tasty and not greasy and the tartar sauce was chunky and creamy. The cocktail sauce was a tad vinegary for my liking, but it had good flavor.  The only thing that I think would take this place to the next level and give it an extra star is some hand cut fresh 'chips' because while cooked well, you can tell they came out of a bag. I'll definitely be returning and bringing friends with me next time!

I've been going here for years. They've always been very friendly, professional and honest which I value greatly in a mechanic. They treat me like family and that's something that cannot be measured in stars.

Breakfast is easy. As far as restaurants are concerned, it's something that's very hard to screw up. Menu creation can't be all that difficult because of the classic meat + egg + potato + bread formula we've all come to expect. I'm not here to write to say Over Easy screwed up, but they were on the verge of coming close.  I had been wanting to try Over Easy for about a  year now, partly because of all the media attention is has received locally as well as nationally. I'm always up for an alternative to the national chain pancake houses I grew up eating at. For this reason and the classic breakfast formula being so hackneyed and often trite, I am often inclined to avoid that part of the men, unless [the restaurateurs] try something a little different with it.  Over Easy showed promise with a little dish they call "The Wolfpack".   Upon more objective observation, the dish is just a mild variation on an old classic with more starch, luring you into a false sense of hedonistic pleasure, but really just filling your belly with potato.  Being my first time here, and looking to enjoy a good hearty breakfast, I decided to play it relatively safe and ordered The Hopple Popple. Chunks of salami, potato, cheese and egg scrambled together with bell peppers for color and for texture and served with a side of toast. It's another variation on an old classic and probably not unlike something I'd make at home, so I decided to try it.  It's description reminded me of something I had ordered at Matt's Big Breakfast not too long ago, so why not.  My first thought as my server placed my plate in front of me was "That's it?" Presentation left something to be desired and even though the atmosphere had a somewhat kitschy greasy spoon vibe to it, I wasn't all that impressed. The amount of salami was substantial, but the chunks were so big, they appeared sparse in the monochromatic assembly of ingredients that lay before me. It may sound silly, but a small bit of parsley or a sprig of rosemary as garnish would have probably classed up the plate a little.  My wife tried the Chicken Fried Steak, an old classic I am always drawn to, especially at independents because it really gives them a chance to shine. Any old restaurant can take a flash frozen fritter and drop it in the deep fryer, but it really takes something to bread your own steak. For that I give Over Easy kudos.   For my daughter, the economic egg + potato + bread dish (add meat for $2 more) satisfied all nutritional requisites but was very basic in it's execution. The most interesting part of the whole meal was when the matriarch of the crew behind the counter shared with us their Tomato Jam, a salty sweet concoction that was equally good as a spread on toast as it was a dip for tater tots.    In all, I wasn't all that impressed, but the menu showed promise and perhaps next time I'll be a little more adventurous in my selection as long is isn't just thrown on the plate because going out isn't all about the food, it's the experience as well.

Let me start off this review by saying that I haven't been to a dentist since the turn of the century, possibly before. When I heard about this practice, I knew I had to give them a chance.  Upon walking in to the waiting room, I was enthusiastically greeted by Cheryl's warm and friendly face. After the thorough process of filling out new patient forms and a brief wait, Raquel led me back to a clean, spacious room with large floor to ceiling windows and offered me a seat.  After the initial series of x-Rays, Dr. Wu came in and performed the exam herself. Occasionally, she would rattle off numbers to her assistant, but she put my mind at ease explaining ahead of time what and why she'd be doing. Throughout whole ordeal, I was willfully distracted by a television they had playing in the exam room.  Although it had been over 10 years since I had been to a dentist, the staff at Gentle Care Dentistry made the whole process more bearable, almost to the point of pleasant. I will definitely be making them my regular dental care provider.

I love this place! Great food, great atmosphere and friendly people. Located in an old Native New Yorker, the new owners really took this place and made it their own. It's a great neighborhood bar, perfect for watching the game or just hanging out with friends.

I recently discovered this place while seeking out a place to have lunch while working in downtown Phoenix. Featured on an instant redeemable coupon app on my phone I decided to give the little guys a chance. Although slightly more expensive than a Mickey D's, its worth it. I got the "Frankenburger" which I believe was invented for shock value more than anything. It's a standard hamburger with the usual condiments but where it takes on a life of its own is the generous addition of ham. Not quite a cold cut, not quite a carver's select, but something in between. The whole thing is sandwiched between a bun (top AND bottom) that has been sliced and stuffed with with cheese. For a dollar more, you can order a half order of the self-proclaimed "Best" fries which is a sufficient helping of freshly sliced potato, fried and salted. Tasty, but being stuck in a Styrofoam to go box left them limp. I also got a Bean & Cheese burrito because they do claim to be a Latin American restaurant. I was too full after my burger, but by the looks of it, it could give any of the local "Bertos" a run for their money.

A new Asian super buffet going in a vacant Black Angus Steakhouse? I'm there! There's got to be at  least one establishment open for business along Southern Avenue from Alma School to Longmore. For this review, I feel it will be best to list pros and cons about my experience on a recent Saturday evening...  Pros:  Attentive Hostess/Wait Staff; Unique Decor, Large selection of food choices available, separate price for children; real ice cream (as opposed to that frozen ice milk that most Asian buffets serve (wtf is that?)); Spacious floor plan to accomodate a large number of patrons as well as ease in navigating the different stations  Cons: Is the use of 3 different styles of chandeliers intentional? I kind of like consistency, otherwise it looks like you've outfitted your establishment from Goodwil finds.  Speaking of consistency ... If you're going to label SOME things, label EVERYthing. Most things I could figure out, but that makeshift taquito-looking thing looked like it was filled with Steak Tartare rather than taco meat. Which brings me to my next point. I've been to enough of these kinds of establishments and I've been a parent long enough to realize that sometimes there's picky eaters out there, children especially. So if you want to serve Pizza, I may find it a little out of place, but I can let it slide.    What I DON'T get, is the taco station, and the Tapatio hot sauce on the table. True, most Asian buffets are frequented by Hispanic families. I totally get that, believe me, but if an ASIAN establishment with a taco bar is walking a fine line. If it starts serving Horchatas and Tamarindo waters (like I've seen one do), then my natural instinct is to think that they've sold out, or they don't know what they're specializing in and when that happens, they run the risk of having their quality suffer. If Mexi-Chino Fusion is your goal, then brand yourselves as such. That's all I'm saying. Good night.
