I would give negative star I could. The menu pricing is not in line with what they charging. This is illegal and unethical. I will report this to BBB and state commerce.

If there's negative star I would give them a negative 5 stars. The chandler location are crook and they would steal from you. Stay away from them. I was given an estimate for repairs and the final bills turned to be 10 times higher than the estimate. I initially refused to pay them for the bill and finally had to pay it to get the truck to be released. Definitely going to fill with BBB on this. I can't let them get away from this.

They were good before several years ago! But had a really bad experience with quicken loans this year while I tried to purchase house this year. I ended up spent $1000+ for  nothing. It's unfair and they had no consideration for others. Please stay away from this loan company !!

Stay away from this restaurant. The quality is awful. All frozen seafood. And the waitress brought us the wrong food. After we had a bite of the roll, they took it back and served it to another table. Grossss!! I feel bad for other girl.

Not a bad Mexican food chain restaurant. Servers are attentive.   But there's a much better and cheaper option down the street from this joint.

Worst service in town. Bought certificate at restaurant.com and was told that we couldn't use it since they don't honor the certificate anymore. I have to get my $ back from them. Haven't tried their food and I will not come here again

Worst location for smoothies. They gave 2/3 in a cup. When I asked why it's not completely full and their response was you want more. It's as if I am not supposed to have full serving. Will never come back to this location. So frustrating.

I would give the barista a negative star if I could. Come in to refill my coffee and got told that I can't do at this store since I didn't get the coffee at this store this morning. Poor service. Will not come here ever again.

Pretty much underwhelmed by the food here. Ordered chicken basil. Chicken is dry and tasteless. And they need to work on the smell of the place. I smelled like grease after eating there. Gross

Food was great at my moms Thai kitchen. Me friend and I ordered the Thai basil chicken and 3 appetizers, spring rolls, fried octopus and chicken satays. The appetizers were 50% off for happy hour.  They were all great, especially the fried octopus. it was tender which is really hard to make since most restaurant over cook it.  Chicken basil was yummy too. I am from Malaysia. It's hard to find authentic Asian cookings here in Phoenix. Definitely would go back again. And not mention the staffs are super friendly!!

No comparison to the one in chandler. Less quality less selections and less everything.
