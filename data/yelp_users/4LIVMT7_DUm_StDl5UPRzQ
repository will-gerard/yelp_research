My friend told me that this would be the perfect first date spot and he was correct! The atmosphere was amazing and the weather was great so requested to sit on the patio. Our server was very knowledgable about all the menu items as well as the wine list.  Will definitely be coming back here soon!

After seeing this place about a year ago I've wanted to try it out as I love a good burger. Went in Sunday night with the girlfriend and was excited to see they were still a good amount of people around 8pm.   We ordered the Primetime, Arugula Salad and some fries. The fries came out right away and they were really good with the chipotle ketchup. Once the food came out I was impressed with the look of both our meals. Took a bite of my burger and it was like warm at best. I ordered medium rare but that means a warm red center not cold. The server took the plate away and came back shortly after informing me that medium rare came like that... The arugula salad was amazing and was pretty jealous of my girlfriends meal. The manager came back with my new burger and this one was hot and a lot better but still bland.   Was expecting a lot more after I had built this place up in my mind.
