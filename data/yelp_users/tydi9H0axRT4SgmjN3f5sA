I have been going to Babbitt for a few years now with my BMW and they are amazing! They are very fairly priced, honest and trustworthy - you can't say that for dealerships. I have taken my car to the Tempe location and now since I have moved take my car to the Scottsdale Rd location and couldn't be happier with the work and service they provide. I would recommend these guys to anyone who owns a BMW!

This location I disappointing...I used to come here with no issues making a reservation in advance. Twice now I've shown up to them saying I don't have a reservation and they don't have any openings for hours later. Very frustrating when you go out of your way to try and schedule ahead and the staff can't handle making simple reservations for customers.
