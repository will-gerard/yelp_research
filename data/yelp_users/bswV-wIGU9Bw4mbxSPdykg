The sliders are fantastic.  The Chicago style hotdogs are good as well.   If I was including the years of positive experiences I have had with my family at  this location I would add another star.

Best Funeral Services has helped my family twice now.  Both times they have been considerate of our spiritual and emotional need to provide the best quality care for our loved ones.  The focus was on taking care of our loved ones and not on which packages we had to buy.    As she guided us through the process Julia  R.  was more of a family member than a funeral director.  The end result was a beautiful, dignified farewell to our loved ones.

I have been going to this Firestone location for more than a decade for service work.     Over the years the management team and technicians (too complex these days to call them mechanics) overall have done a great job for my family's cars.  I am never sold something I don't need.  The items I asked to be fixed are addressed during the first visit.  No return visits for the same issue.  They honor competitor's coupons.  Invariably the staff is courteous, pleasant and timely with their service.

A classic American donut shop.  Their glazed donuts are a sublime expression of the baker's art.     Every now and then I  buy two dozen and take them to work.   I have always heard expressions from my coworkers on how truly good Rainbow donuts products are.

Went to Taquitos today.    The service was worse than their usual indifferent mediocrity.   Today they told me to wait while they spoke with a vendor rather than taking my order.     Following that they did not even meet the minimum bar of getting my order right. It was nowhere close.  I have previously been to Taquitos and had decidely mediocre service but excellent food.  Unfortunately they could not even meet that standard this time.  Spend your money somewhere where it will be appreciated.

I have been going to Niro's for several years.  You can always count on them fulfilling your your order very quickly and with consistently good quality.  When I am in a hurry between meetings I can count on Niro's to deliver a better experience than I could get at a random fast food joint.  The gyros are good, the french fries are hot and crisp and the service is always friendly.

Visited Capriotti's today for a Cheesesteak.  When I walked in during lunch hour literally no one was present behind the counter.  After waiting a bit less than five minutes an employee emerged from the back and took my order.   Little by little after that employees continued to emerge from the back and finally the manager.  I doubt whatever spill they mentioned to me would have required the entire restaurant's staff to clean.  Strangely today the shop wasn't busy nor were all the tables taken as usual.  Aside from the strange service experience the sandwich was wonderful.

Stopped by for coffee and a bagel sandwich.  All but two of the coffee urns were out of coffee.  I ordered the bagel breakfast sandwich with what was reputed to be eggs with bacon and cheese.   The eggs resembled an egg substitute rather than real eggs.  The flavor supported that assumption.    The cheese at least tasted like real cheddar cheese.  Between ordering and after eating no one had refilled the coffee.  The staff were friendly enough despite being disengaged.  All in all I won't return to this Einstein's and won't order anything other than a bagel should I visit another.  I would have been better off at the Starbucks which is less than twenty yards away.

A splendid Italian deli in Scottsdale.  I frequented Guido's when I lived down the street in Scottsdale.  The food is invariably fresh and tasty.    The grocery selection of italian staples is fantastic.

Stopped by today for some Sushi with my heterosexual life partner.  We were seated by the hostess quickly but waited ten or more minutes to be waited on.  The hostess noted we had not been servedand went to find a waiter.  There was a delay even after that point.  This did provide us with plenty of time to get our order of sushi.  When our waiter arrived he tried to leave after taking  the drink order.  I stopped him and had him take our sushi order before he wandered off again.  This level of service is what I would expect in Greece where literally I have had to chase waiters down to get a beer.  The sushi when it arrived was good.  We enjoyed the Las Vegas roll and the Gojira roll (GoJiiiirrrraaa!!!!) the most.  The fried banana desert was splendid.  Overall the quality of the food was shadowed by the at best indifferent service.

Hosted a dinner for a medium sized party here.  The manager and staff did a great job getting everyone their drinks and food.    Noteworthy was the follow through on expediting meals for several guests who had to leave shortly for the airport.  I am giving three stars for the food and a bonus star for the efficient and friendly management and staff.

We stopped in at Pei Wei for a late dinner.  Despite being packed the staff was very friendly and did not seem harried like another location I visit.  Our food was done in a reasonable amount of time and delivered to the table.   The Kung Pao chicken was good to very good.   Light on spiciness despite ordering extra but they did have the sambal olek sauce available to spice things up.    The chicken teriyaki was good.  Even the toddler with us had some and liked it.  We also had a bit of confusion.  I attempted to get two orders of pad thai; one to go and one to eat there.  Unfortunately I did not review the order at the ordering station.  When I wondered where the second order of paid thai was when our food was delivered I checked the receipt and noted it was not there.  Pei Wei brought us a second order anyway with out charging.  All in all the food was good but the service was far above what I expect at Pei Wei.  It was a nice end for  a long day.

Stopped by for the first time in close to twenty years and it was better than I remember it being.  The deli sandwiches were as good as any I have had in Philly , Chicago or Kansas City.  All of your Italian specialty foods are available.  They even have decaf espresso.   So stop by have a sandwich in the deli, take home some canoli and enjoy some espresso.

We met with family at Blue Adobe recently.  I had the Cruz Kitchen plate (Chile Relleno, Tenderloin and Carne Adovada) and my wife had the Carne Adovada.   The red chile on my Cruz Kitchen plate was delightfully spicy but not a challenge.   The Chile Relleno was crisp on the outside but not soggy or overdone. The tenderloin was wonderful.  The Carne Adovada was wonderful.  My wife enjoyed the prickly pear margarita with dinner.   All in all a very solid restaurant to add to our New Mexican cuisine rotation.

We stopped in at the Keg for dinner and had a splendid time.  Service was prompt and efficient.  The food was splendidly done.     We had the goat cheese appetizer and were very pleased with the baked cheese flavors.   The salad's greens were crisp and not overly covered in dressing.  The vegetables were crisp and not overcooked.     I ordered a rare filet.  It was a wonderfully done rare when it arrived.  The only thing that could have made it better was more blood.    My spouse ordered the filet and crab. Each was done perfectly.  The big surprise was the coffee was as good the creme brulee (not so last time).  I highly recommend the Keg as an alternative to more pricey alternatives (Ruth's Chris and Morton's).

We stopped by while on Las vegas and we're delighted by the flavor and spiciness at Krung Thai.  We had drunken noodles with four stars and it was wonderful  even with added heat the flavor w as still there.  The pad thai was very good as well.

I have used Cool Touch for several years and have invariably been pleased with the service I receive.  Cool Touch is always on time, polite and clean up after themselves.     Cool Touch repaired my previous A/C unit and when it was no longer repairable sold me my new one.  When my water heater stopped working Cool Touch was out the same day I called to fix it .  Rather than selling me a new unit they informed me all I needed was a thermostat, saving me $600 or more.  They do not try to sell me anything I do not need.  This is far and away the best home service experience I have had.

My wife and I went to Sala Thai  off of a friend's recommendation.  Normally we go to either Malee's or Swaddee Thai restaurants.  We beat the Saturday evening rush which was in full swing by the time we were leaving.  Our appetizer was Satay sticks.  They were pleasantly gingery and not overdone.   I loved the cucumber dipping sauce and peanut sauce.  For entree I had the Drunken Noodles at Medium spiciness so I could share with my wife while  she had the Lard Na.  The  Drunken Noodles were delightfully spicy for Medium.   Many restaurants this would be 4 or 5 star spicy.  I loved it as the many flavors of the chicken and other spices were not overpowered by the heat.  We also ordered Thai bbq sausage to split.  This was a delightfully smokey and spicy sausage  and a great compliment to our entrees.  Overall the meal was great and the service  good despite being busy.  On my next visit I  will  be trying their curry dishes and just maybe the Drunken Noodles but hot rather than medium.

I have gone back and tried the curry on multiple occaisions.  The Masuman curry is the best I have ever had.  The red curry when ordered spicy is flavorful and brings the heat.  The Thai fried rice is good too.

We stopped in today for a nice dinner of Thai food and Sala Thai did not disappoint.  We had the drunken noodles, pad thai and masuman curry.  The masuman continues to be the best I have had.  The drunken noodles were splendidly flavorful and a mouthful of fire at the same time.  Delightful!  The paid thai arrived and was a treat of fiery goodness.   We requested hot and the staff at Sala Thai delivered!

Picked up dinner consisting of masuman curry, drunken noodles and pad thai.    The food was not the same as our other visits.  Rather than the very good experience the food was mediocre at best.  The masuman curry was not even close to previous efforts.  Frankly I could recognize it was curry but not strictly masuman curry.  The Paid Thai was also off from their usual effort.  As if the Pad Thai sauce was the one I get in a bottle from the Asian market.  Could have been an  off night.

I needed spicy food after returning from some travel to a location with bland food.  I went back to India Palace upon my return two weeks ago and was impressed by the improvement from solid good to very good across our favorite dishes (chicken tikka masala, lamb biryani, lamb vindaloo and chicken curry).  Today I picked up carry out expecting a similar experience but was surprised that what had been good to very good now was great to amazing.    The chicken tikka masala was the best I have had in years.   My lips are still burning from the spiciness of the lamb vindaloo which was just the way I love it; very, very spicy and flavorful.  I do not know what the difference is but India Palace has impressed me, a long time customer.   While the biryani was not as spicy as the lamb vindaloo, it was the most flavorful biryani I have had in probably ten years.   All in all a splendid experience.

Really enjoyed this family restaurant experience.  Great fish fried crispy on the outside.  Great beer selection. Perhaps too much footy on the telly though.  While I could not find a fish and chip shop  in  the UK while I was there  I can count on the Codfather when I return to Phoenix.

We stopped in for dinner this weekend.  Something happened  to move the experience from pretty good to great.  The sausage roll and shepherd's pie were amazing with a perfectly done light, flaky crust.  The fish we had was perfectly done.  Still too much footie on the tellie though.

We stopped in at Sauce this evening for dinner prior to some pre-Valentines Day shopping.  The restaurant was busy.  Despite this the staff was very friendly and efficient.  The food was delivered quickly and was of the same good quality as my previous visits despite being a busy evening.  The young lady who took our order first secured us a table and then took our order with a warm smile.  Bravo to the staff and management at Sauce.  Four stars for the restaurant and a bonus star for the great service.

Stopped by for dinner while in Montreal to partake of French food with a Montreal twist.  The restaurant had a relaxed, warm atmosphere.  I had the seal smoked seal appetizer.  It was amazing, like buffalo meat but with a hint of the sea   For the main course had the Sweetbreads and a taste of the beef.  The Sweetbreads were very nice to try.   The beef is the type of dish you come back for and recommend to your friends.

Had a wonderful visit at Christopher's.  We have been going here since they were across the street from the current location.  The appetizer we enjoyed was the escargot, charmingly referred to as "snails" on the menu.  The pastry covering the escargot was light, flaky and wonderful.  The butter and garlic the escargot was sauteed in was superb, easily the best in Phoenix.  My wife loved the lobster puff pastry.  It had a beautiful looking crust.    I enjoyed the truffle infused filet mignon.  It was done absolutely perfectly and was a delight.  The desert we had was amazing; the berries tart with the homemade, well Christopher's made ice cream.  Even the coffee was perfect, a french press of coffee.  All in all another wonderful visit.

After having heard good things about Dillon's Kansas City style barbeque we decided to try it out  today.  We ordered three plate meals with sausage, pork ribs, pulled pork, brisket and burnt ends.  The brisket was very good.  Not dried out.  The burnt ends were cubed not sliced thin.  Great smoky flavor.    The sausage was nicely smoked, a solid good but not outstanding.   The rib meat on the bone was very tender.  Not dried out.  Solid good.   Pulled pork was wonderfully sweet and smoky.  The fried pickles appetizer were really good.  The sauces we tried were all good.  The sweet heat most representative of the spicy tomato based bbq sauce used in Kansas City.  For BBQ food in Phoenix the only place I've had that comes close to this good is  Haps.  Our server was warm, cheerful and efficient.

The chicken is wonderful, spicy, crispy on the outside perfectly moist on the inside.  Far superior to  other fried chicken chains (you know who they are).  The chicken strips are fantabulous.  The fried okra and dirty rice are good.  Not the fastest place for chicken but what they lack in fast food style  fried chicken speed they more than make up for in flavor.

We went to the Meritage Steakhouse today.  We were met with an indifferent greeting by the Maitre D' and were seated promptly.  Our waiter Jerome was upbeat, pleasant and fast in an efficient, graceful way.    We ordered the Seafood Platter as an appetizer and it was very good.   Our main course were two different types of steak. I ordered Medium Rare, if in doubt err on  the rare side and my wife ordered Medium.   Our sides were asparagus and twice baked potatoes.  The steaks arrived unfortunately done in each other's requested state.  Mine arrived Medium to medium well and my wife's a very medium rare.    Not a big deal we just switched steaks despite them being different cuts.  The asaragus varied from a perfect  crispy to wet and soggy.  They had obviously mixed our asaragus with some that was lying around.  The twice baked potatoes were good.  Desert was creme brulee (very good) and the chocolate cake which was also good. Our coffee and cappuccino were very good.  For the price paid I was disappointed.  I would have gladly paid more at Morton's or Fleming's.  For the same money Ruth's Chris or The Keg would have been a better bet.  I am giving this two stars due to the fantastic service provided by Jerome.

Stopped by this morning  for a coffee while I waited for the traffic backups to dissipate.   I had the expected, relentlessly upbeat and positive customer service experience that Dutch Bro's is famous for.  I was feeling better about the morning before the first sip of coffee.  Oh, and the coffee was amazing (large coffee with extra shot).  A stop at the Dutch Bro's can turn your day around.

We stopped in for lunch when in the area.     The staff was friendly and were quickly seated and served.  Service continued to be excellent throughout our visit.  We had the Pineapple and shrimp curry and Pad Kee Mao.  The curry was wonderful.  Certainly on par with the best Thai food i have eaten elsewhere.  The Pad Kee Mao (Spicy noodles) was wonderfully spicy without losing flavor.    For dessert we had the fried bananas which were simply amazing.  All in all I would recommend the Thai House to friends. We will visit again when in the area.

Stopped by for lunch with friends from work.    I had the Jamaican jerk chicken.    The chicken was very flavorful.   The festivals were every bit as good as those I had in Jamaica.  The food was slow to arrive.  If you are going for lunch and are on a tight schedule this is not the place unless you arrive early enough for the buffet.  The price was high for the serving size.  Overall it was a nice change from the usual lunch fare.

We had a delightful experience at Richardson's today.  The chipotle ribs small plate was amazing.  The chorizo stuffed pork chop and chimayo chicken were wonderful.   The service at the table was warm, friendly and efficient.  Frankly the New Mexican cuisine at Richardson's is better than the restaurants in Santa Fe New Mexico.  If you visit don't forget to have a prickly pear margarita or two.

We celebrated a family birthday here.    Richardson's staff made it as wonderful as twenty years of memories there could have aspired to.  The New Mexico platter was absolutely the epitome of New Mexican Cuisine.  Our native New Mexican was impressed with the adovada entree.  My chorizo pork chop was simply amazing.  Nothing in New Mexico was on this level of service and flavor.  All said another wonderful visit to Richardson's.

We had a family dinner at Rigatony's on Saturday evening.    Despite being busy at no time did service slow or seem inadequate.  Our server was warm, friendly and efficient.   We started with the sampler appetizer which had fried zucchini, tortellini and ravioli.  The fried ravioli were surprisingly splendid in flavor.   Most of us had the build your own pasta.  It was invariably thought well done by all.  Even the waif like girls at our table finished their pasta.  I had the chicken parmesan which was good.  The marinara sauce a sweet version missing some of the garlic flavor and depth I am used to but very good in its own fashion.   We finished with coffee and canoli. The canoli were sweet and creamy with a softer texture than I am used to but very good none the less. The coffee was good but missing the strong espresso like flavor i am used to at \ authentic Italian restaurants in the U.S..  My only regret was not bringing home some of their apple bread pudding.

Stopped by today and picked up a cup of coffee.  Ordering was very nice.  A friendly welcome at the register was followed by patience while my heterosexual life partner agonized over what snack to get ( healthy almond bar or enticing pastry).  The Iced Coffee I had was easily the best I have had in years.   No old stale coffee kept in a pitcher.  Fresh, strong made coffee was used.  My heterosexual life partner loved her something-something-foofoo-machiatto.  This place serves the best cup of coffee I have found without flying 3000 miles.  Another great plus was the warm, welcoming atmosphere.

Stopped in at Arizona Firearms with a specific firearms purchase in mind.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The atmosphere was very relaxed.  No pressure to hurry up and buy despite the shop being filled with customers.  The prices were good to very good on broad selection of firearms.  The paperwork phase was handled efficiently.  My spouse thought the shop was very ladies friendly and enjoyed the visit.  One of, if not the best firearms purchase experiences I have ever had.

We stopped in for lunch during a weekday.    The beer we tried was a light pale ale with was refreshing on a hot day.    We both had a barbecue burger.  The burger was done as requested.  All the ingredients were fresh including the jalapeños I had added to my burger.    The service was friendly and relaxed.  Budget more than hour for lunch if you are visiting during a weekday.    I look forward to returning and trying the spectrum of freshly brewed beers they offer.

I tried India Grill today.    I ordered Lamb Karahi, Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Biryani.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was good.  Not great but a solid good.  The Lamb Karahi was nice.  Pleasantly spicy with other flavors making themselves known.  The Lamb Biryani was sub par.  I have had much better.  I have also had Lamb Biryani that was worse (that place is out of business).  All in all an OK experience.  I give it two stars for being more expensive than my usual Indian restaurant (India Palace).

Stopped by for lunch today.   I have never seen an Indian buffet this busy.    There were no choices other than buffet (no individual dishes until dinner).  The buffet made up for that in its dizzying array of choices including the best biryani I have had in a long time.  Each of the dishes had decent flavor. I was very impressed with the chili chicken, biryani and butter chicken.   For a buffet the food was very flavorful.  The food was flavorful enough that I want to come back for dinner and see what spicy means to them.   For those that want their food to "bring the heat" this buffet is not going to excite you but it is flavorful.  The only negative I saw was the naan was done like it was for a buffet that didn't match the caliber of the dishes available at Chutneys.

During  a work conference I suggested Chutney's as a lunch option.  My coworkers of Indian subcontinent extraction agreed heartily with my choice.  Chutney's lunch buffet delivered with a wonderful dining experience.  Good food, plenty of table room for  a large group and good service.  After dining my suggestion garnered me props from my peers notably from those who grew up in India.  They were very pleased with the flavor and variety.  I will take that as an endorsement for the flavor and quality of the experience at Chutney's.

Met a friend for lunch today. His suggestion was a new place around the corner from office, the Crepe Bar.  I  ordered the Papa K crepe.   The crepe  was well flavored with ham and much to my surprise had a  crispy texture at the edges.  The Crepe Bar will be a welcome addition to the rotation of lunch places around the work place.

After seeing the Fate Brewing opening announcement on yelp I went to try it out.  We visited during the soft opening.    The ambiance is warm and casual with a very open and airy feel.  The beer is quite good. The Pale Ale will be familiar and likable for those who enjoy Stone Brewing products.  The cream ale is for those that like the American mass produced lagers (your Bud and miller lite drinking friends).  The double IPA needs to be given a chance to warm up before enjoying it.  It was good but I think overshadowed by how good the Pale Ale, an India Pale Ale in all but name.  I had the capicola pizza which was quite good and arrived at the table quickly.  I give this four stars for the beer and food and a bonus star for the friendly and efficient staff.

We stopped in this weekend for beer and dinner.    While the beer had been a solid three stars before it was now a solid five stars (American Pale Ale).  Truly an exemplary example of the IPA style somewhere between the mega hopped American IPAs and English IPAs.    Liquid Art for your enjoyment on tap.  The food was a solid three stars.  The only downside was the bread was burnt for the bread and spread appetizer.

We had a wonderful lunch at Los Dos Molinos.   My spouse enjoyed the prickly pear margarita.     The green salsa was splendidly fiery.  The red salsa was a heartier version with less heat than the green salsa but more than most restaurants provide.  We both had the carne adovada and it was spectacular.   The sopapillas were enjoyable.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The food at the Camelback location was every bit as good as the one on Central south of Baseline.    We will definitely be stopping by this location again.

I took my spouse out for Indian food this evening.  Rather than our usual we wanted to try a new location and Chennai Chettinaad did not disappoint.  We tried a variety meat and vegetarian dishes.  The chicken tikka masala was flavorful and mildly spicy.  My go to "heat" dish, lamb vindaloo, was flavorful with tender chunks of lamb. While I had ordered the maximum spice level what I received was a medium.  We also ordered a vegetarian dosa which was done with the same level of care as the other dishes.  The last dish ordered was biryani. The biryani was a solid good.  I look forward to seeing what it is like with added "heat".  The service at the restaurant was good to very good.  All in all a very charming restaurant whose attention to detail showed in everything from the excellence of the dishes to the decor.

I have been wanting to try Dutch Brother's Coffee for awhile now.   Until today I have not a match up of thirst and proximity to a Dutch Bros. Coffee.  We stopped by today and had the most positive customer experience I can ever remember.  The relentlessly positive and efficient staff made buying an ice coffee  absolutely a joy.  The service was so good that if you were having a bad day just stopping in and getting a coffee from the staff would turn it around.  On top of the customer service experience the coffee was very good as well.  I will be stopping by Dutch Bros. Coffee in the future and will prefer it to other coffee shops.

We stopped at the Mayuri Palace for dinner.    We ordered our favorite dishes.   I was delighted that the lamb vindaloo I ordered was delivered as requested; very spicy.   The flavor was not overwhelmed by the spiciness.  We had a shrimp curry and chicken tikka masala as well. All dishes were done very well.  Our sever was very warm and cheerful.  We will be returning to the Mayuri Palace for dinner and to try the lunch buffet.

Someone recommended we stop by and try Two Sister's Thai food.     We stopped in and had a wonderful dining experience.  The Thai food itself was the best I have ever had.  The Pad Thai and Drunken noodles were fantastic.  The Masuman curry was truly amazing.    Apparently everything is made from scratch.     The service was warm, friendly and efficient.  We will be back often.

My wife and I are long time patrons of Baby Kay's.  We were happy to see that they had reopened at last and had to visit.  We had Po'boy sandwiches (pork, half shrimp and half catfish), a crab cake and some gumbo.  The chicken and andouille sausage gumbo was as wonderful as ever.  The crab cakes was delightfully spicy.  The sandwiches wonderful with the same crunchy chips.  We also took home some Bread Pudding which was splendid as usual.    All in all a fantastic visit.

The closest I've had in Phoenix to pastries in Paris.  The pain au chocolat  (chocolate croissant) was absolutely splendid.  They also have gelato and macaroons.  I look forward to returning frequently.
