After shopping around for the right Vet, we finally came across this office! Dr. Cruz truly cares for every pet that walks into his office! He spent 45 min with me and my pup, examining him from head to tail.  He explained and talked with me about what he sees and hears, and gave me his knowledgable input. (Trust me, it was helpful, especially since the last vet practically made feel like an idiot for even bringing my puppy)  So needless to say, I finally found a vet that truly cares and gives his all in treating and caring for all of his "patients" =)

Every time I have brought my dog for vaccines, check-ups, etc., everyone has been very friendly and helpful! Dr. Arthur is also wonderful, putting his fury patients first. Our most recent visit, they helped us save a little money, usually it's the other way around! So happy we found this wonderful Veterinarian office!!

Overall my dog was treated very well. The only thing I have to complain about is the front desk. Unfortunately my dog was vomiting, had diarrhea, and couldn't hold his pee. When we first came in he made a mess in the waiting room, then they moved us to an exam room, where he continued to make a major mess. Then they wanted us to move into another room where again he made a mess.  As we were waiting for the vet, I over heard the front desk associate tell either another client or another associate that they couldn't use the "2 rooms" because the "people completely trashed them." As a client trying to obtain the best possible care for my dog does not need to over hear a comment like this! I felt completely disrespected!  On the other hand, Stacey was absolutely wonderful and truly showed her compassion for caring for the various pets that come in.   Considering that this is the only 24 hr emergency clinic, we will probably come back of need be. But I'm very disappointed in the way the front desk associated treated our situation.

Like everyone else is saying, Arizona Heat Pest Services is definitely the best! I called at 9pm and had someone out the very next morning! Luckily we were able to catch the infestation fairly quickly! Paul was extremely helpful and told us what was needed, not trying to over sell. Price is reasonable based on the needed treatment.
