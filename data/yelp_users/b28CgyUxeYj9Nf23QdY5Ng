I've been here quite a few times when I was younger and have recently been going back and I'm glad to see it's just as good as it was! My boyfriend gets the Bob's Big A$$ Burger and he loves it. He get full off of it which is always a good sign.  I get the veggie burger and my gosh it is DELISH!! We also get the garlic fries and zucchini as sides. However the fried tend to be greasy, it add to the old Chicago style! I just drain them on some napkins. The people are nice, not much of a wait, interesting decor, and great food! Whether it's lunch or dinner, this place is great! Yum!

I love all of the vegetarian jerky and miso! Great selection and amazing bakery. Love the coffee pudding and all of the cakes are so delicate and not decadent which I like. I enjoy the almond cream horn! Also try the jubes and canned roasted eel! Mmm! Great place to get special oriental ingredients. Don't go to the regular grocery store because it's cheaper to get them here!

I used to live behind here for all of middle school and high school and this is the place to eat! Whether it's by the Alice of a whole pie, it's the best by far. My mom loves their Greek salad and hot subs. My boyfriend loves their wings and baked ziti. Amin is always friendly and remembers return customers by name! Once we came right as they were closing and he came out and said he'd make our pizza anyways, which was a happy surprise and be greatly appreciate the great service.  Their pizza has a nice crisp crust, the right amount of sauce and cheese. You can taste its homemade and it's done right! Even the leftovers the next day are almost even better. Even cold!  I've since moved further into Scottsdale but still find myself here for pizza. It's like home!

I'm vegan so naturally I love this place! Such great flavours, and nice service. Only problem was the cheesecake I ordered tasted well.... vegan. I've had other vegan cheesecakes that tasted far better, but the carrot cake slice made up for it! This place hits the spot vegan or not!

My boyfriend and I work at the mall right across from here and were so delighted to have found it! The first time we got the pita chips and hemp hummus, as well as the smoked Gouda macaroni and cheese. DELISH! The second time we got the sweet potato chips and they were perfectly sweet, salty, and crunchy. Great food, and nice staff. Great place for a quick snack or lunch!

Love the nostalgia and the atmosphere! I've been here when I was younger and I've returne and still love it! I live down the road from here and stop in time to time to get my fix. I love the old school candy and I love the sodas! The maple bacon was a surprisingly good one haha Great place for typical cactus candy and other Arizona native treats. They have toys and books and some more novelty items, It's a fun place whether you're 4 or 94! Great stuff!

My boyfriend and I were looking to stumble on a new place to eat and we were going to settle for oreganos next door since most places were closed on Sunday, but then we saw this place and had high hopes. We got the jalapeño puffs which were good, a fried wonton with jalapeño, can't go wrong. And they weren't greasy! We thought the rest of the meal wasn't so pleasant. We got vegetable lo mein, broccoli and oyster sauce, and kung pao shrimp. The lo mein was greasy, it looked like spaghetti, and the vegetables weren't cooked and cold. My broccoli order was wrong and I was brought chicken and oyster sauce. But the waitress apologiesed and got me the right order. The shrimp looked good and my boyfriend said it tasted like an average Chinese dish. However not long after he found himself kneeled over the toilet for hours. The only reason I give this place A star is because our waitress was nice and checked on us a lot throughout the night. I don't see myself returning here for another meal. Maybe for those jalapeño puffs....

I would give this place 5 stars but a member if staff is just so rude he forced me to rank a star lower.  The good : I go here after work most days and am a regular. I always get the vegetarian cheesesteak and a vegetarian turkey. They're always fantastic and I'd recommend it to anyone. The staff at night is great, friendly, funny, and they're all around nice workers . Theyre always experimenting or trying to give suggestions for my sandwiches to change it up. The night staff gets 5 stars.  The bad: the first time I went there there was a business woman in front of me ordering, and whom I assume is the manager or owner. (Older man, larger ) was having a ball chatting up and being super friendly. However when it was my turn in line I was greeted with a snobby toned. 'Hello can I help you?' I was very upset by this. I have trouble in social settings , so his 'I don't want to deal with you tone' definitely ruined my mood . One more encounter with him was during a morning time when we ordered a bagel sandwich (which stops being served after 11 as he so rudely stated). We had ordered one about 40 min prior but in the midst of a crowd they forgot to charge us. Once we got home we hopped in our car to go pay. He acted as if we were some punks. All we were trying to do was be honest and pay what they forgot to charge. He needs to work on his people skills.   Other than that, I like the food and staff! (Most of them anyways)

Since my last review each time my boyfriend and I have been in the service and food has been fantastic. The people who work there are very friendly and helpful, and in general funny people. Especially Alex, who seems to genuinely care for his job and us as customers. Also my boyfriend is not allowed on my phone anymore for editing reviews in terrible ways.
