Starving after a long workout sess. w my bestie, we Google search breakfast places in the area. Low and behold, there is one I hadn't known of right down the road from me. Looking for something other than a classic chain breakfast place, we decided to hit up Over Easy. This North Scottsdale location is beautiful; there is a pathway out front with lush desert landscape, with a few well-groomed trees and flowers. Inside, was another story:   Our hostess was darling; I almost felt sorry she had to work there by the end of my visit. Our waitress seemed to be in la -la land the entire time. My friend had to raise her hand like a school child after multiple failed attempts to catch this woman's attention. She also did not smile or offer suggestions. They seemed to have a cool, expensive-looking coffee contraption behind the bar, but nobody seemed to be using it-- prob because the waiters don't suggest it!? Had I known they served bloody Marys I may have ordered that too. I ordered the wolfpack and got a hot, greasy mess of hash browns and bacon w cheese . The cheese was really unnecessary and I wish the hash browns could have at LEAST been crispy. My  friend ordered the chilaquiles and was deceived by the wording on the menu. The menu said "tortillas".... Instead she got a fist sized, greasy-looking egg blend and the entire rest of the plate covered in near-burnt homemade tortilla chips. The whole meal was way over priced for how sucky it was.   I will prob never go back.

Had the most amazing brunch at Little Cleo's. The outdoor patio was clean and nicely set with fresh flowers. The hostess and waitress greeted us right away and a fresh pour of champagne was offered at our table. Truly felt spoiled by the service experience. Hostess knew right away I needed a hook for my purse and when the sun started creeping over onto our table, we were offered a new position right away. We were truly treated like guests. The food was amazing. I didn't think to take pictures, I was having way too much fun with my adorable company. Oysters tasted fresh from the sea, like they just pulled them out and put them on the table. Crab legs were already cut, so no messy work was involved. There was a quinoa salad w avocado to die for and an egg scramble that was simply incredible. I loved this place and I will return.

They get one star because it was the worst service anyone could experience in a drive thru, and I couldn't give them a 0. There was a long line, so I'm sure there was pressure for the employees to go fast, but the girl was rude to the lady in front of me and rang her order on 2 transactions because she was trying to get ppl thru so fast, but ended up making things slower. Then the girl proceeded to be rude to me who was next in line and said, "I can't barely hear- you literally have to put your mouth on the speaker"... ok I'm not literally doing that and did you really just say that? Girl, you can literally kiss my ass, then take your 6 dollar coffee and shove it up yours. Learn customer service. Needless to say I won't be coming back to this location. I will go the the location on hayden and chaparral in the Safeway plaza from now on!!! Those girls are the best! Erika, tammy, and courtney are the best baristas.

Had a great time using my strength to try out the intro class this week. Heather is a very nice and welcoming instructor. I look forward to attending her class again in the future. I would have liked more corrections and a final exercise or tips-sharing to get better at the skills in closing of the workout.
