Chung Ming needs help. If you are searching for huge portions of over salted, goopy, inexpensive, less than average food, this is your place. Noodles are overcooked, almost mushy. Heavy breading on anything breaded. Room temp soda. When dining in, they provide the flimsiest paper plates and plastic forks. The place could use a good scrub-down. The Asian family that works/owns the place are all quite nice, though. Unfortunately, the hoodrat counter girl they hired could use a lesson in customer service and work ethic. She leaned on the counter, playing on her phone while customers waited for service, tables were dirty and spilled food was on the floor. She argued with me about the order I placed. I said that I ordered only 1 order of something- she did a ghetto neck roll and crazy eyes then told me 'Nuh-uh, you ordered TWO!' It was a simple misunderstanding that would not have been so bad had she had some class and respect.

Mr. Wong has the BEST ORANGE CHICKEN I've ever had. It's a tiny place on the NE corner of Peoria and 19th Ave.. in a somewhat junky strip mall. Blink and you might miss it. Because this is a food review, I'll stick to that first. Everything I've ever tried here has been just great, to the point where I've picked up takeout for the family on my way home several times. Their food is always fresh. They cook to order so if you just stroll in, you will have to wait a short bit. Worth it, though. My only gripe- they will charge you for chili, chili oil, extra soy, etc... To the point where the all-business cashier (a short Asian lady with bangs and a bob) will not budge and WILL run your card for 25 cents if you don't have any cash on ya. I found that off-putting, because to me it's worth giving a customer 25 cents in chili versus upsetting and losing them. I chalked it up to cultural and business differences. All this being said, I'll go back again. I've learned to pick and choose my battles carefully :)

Delicious pizza, plain and simple. Small but cozy eatery - always worth the wait at the bar next door (Bar Bianco). This place is one reason I wish I lived closer to downtown Phx. :)

ALL DAY Happy hour Monday thru Thursday. Unbelievable! Friday- Sunday, their HH runs from 3-6. Very friendly service, the servers are pleasant and always smiling.  I ordered 2 rolls (raw, as I'm not a fan of fried or cooked rolls), an order of spring rolls (6 mini rolls) and a Kirin Light sake bomb- $17!!! Delicious Bargain!! My only negative feedback would be that the dipping sauce for the spring rolls was really salty. It made me squint and ask for water. Otherwise the sushi itself was fresh and delish, service was nice. I tend to be a location snob, but places like this are changing my ways; I've learned that location isn't always everything. Some of the best hidden food wonders I've found are in divey strip mall locations. I'll definitely be back :)

Hob Nobs is in a cozy bungalow with a fireplace, very relaxed atmosphere. Lovely outdoor patio, sometime has live jazz, which is quite nice. Friendly staff. A vast menu.... Soups, salads, sandwiches, pizza, appetizers, smoothies, baked goods, teas, bottled sodas, beer and wine. It's well kept up, clean and food is always fresh. Each time I've gone, no complaints/ food is always delicious. To me, if you blended your home with a caf√©, a bakery, diner and pub, you'd have Hob Nobs. The only minus I can think of is their parking situation. It's very limited but there are places to park across the street.

This place has delicious, fresh foods. Great macaroons. One of the best breakfast dishes to try here are the Chickpea pancakes. Sounded weird to me at first, but man oh man, was I wrong!

First time visit and definitely not my last. I was in the mood for a cucumber wrapped roll. While it wasn't on the menu, the sushi chef was kind enough to grant my lunchtime request. It tasted like heaven, so fresh and crunchy with just the right kick thanks to spicy tuna. Amazing happy hour all day long from 11-4:30 and again from 7 to close. The service is so friendly. I couldn't help but notice almost every customer that left gave a hearty thank you and/or good-bye and it was happily returned. A good sign in my book. For all location snobs: Please don't let the strip mall facade deter you, there is a hidden gem inside Sushi Bros. Give it a try. I know I'll definitely be back!

This place is worth a visit. Excellent breakfast deals. I've had breakfast and lunch here. Reminds me of the delicious drive thru burger joints all over SoCal.  Huge menu selection... Greek, sandwiches, burgers, kabobs, salads. Super friendly service.  I must say... the meats, lettuce, tomatoes, bread... All super fresh. I read one review where they said the lettuce was bad. Not in my case. I'm really picky about food freshness. No complaints here. I'll be back, most definitely!

This little hole in the wall does not disappoint. Located in a busy strip mall. Nothing fancy inside, just chairs, tables, a tv and delicious mariscos. Fresh seafood, nothing here is cooked. They have the real Mexican coke in the bottles, few other bottled selections, and canned soda. Friendly folks running the place, despite the language barrier it was a great meal and we'll be back
