Awesome place, downstairs is very cozy with perfect ambiance.  Dirty martinis were perfect & all 9 apps that we had were delicious!  The tuna was my favorite... I highly recommend this low key spot!

EEEW NO! THIS PLACE IS SUPER, MEGA TACKY! WAY GHETTO! When My son was younger (6) he asked me to take him there, I did! And OMG we both hated it! And we tried it a second time when my girlfriend had a bday party for her son and It was just horrible. The people that go there are all shady looking, I'd say a dangerous crown. This place is NO FUN! And It's a scary crowd. yukky!

We mostly eat here out of convenience cause its right by home. but sincerely there's nothing special happening with this pizza. average tasting. prices are obviously cheap. And the actual restaurant smells bad when i enter - we just phone order and pick up. salad bar spread always appears unappetizing, old lettuce and such. I guess it's true what they say; "you get what you pay for"???

FACT: The gal that helping me out today was super nice, helpful & professional. Very pleasant and great customer service, which I loved and always appreciate at any business.  FACT: The equipment sucks! The tanning bed I used for 10 minutes made a ton of scary crackling sounds the whole while and just didn't allow me to relax.  Also the spray tan machine did NOT release a fine mist, it spit out big chunky splatter of tanning fluid. Left me looking like I had a skin disease!!!! So I had to act quick - before it dried I frantically rubbed forever to spread out the liquid that was unevenly splashed at me. Ugh so yucky and unpleasant.  I blame my 2 star rating on the equipment, the machines at celebrity tanning are oh so much better - perfect even fine mist. I'll go back to celebrity.

For Chinese food, THIS PLACE IS THE BOMB! It's not a fast food greasy take out joint!!! This is a little cozy spot, very low key but Oh man let me tell you the food is great! My kids get the beef broccoli and usually I'll get the sun devil chicken or the orange chicken with steamed rice, It's not over breaded and the meat is all white no skin! Soooooooooooooo yummy! Prices are super good too, very inexpensive meal! I promise! Abacus you rock!

I droped off 18 pieces last week for cleaning., the gal that took my clothes wasn't very friendly. my husband picked up my clothes on Monday, when i came home he asked me If it was normal to pay $140.00 for dry cleaning.... I was like "WHATTTT?" - omg that's too much., yup they charged him approx $7.77 per item.  I'm sorry but that's way too much.  and today when I went to wear one of my tops, I removed it from the plastic and found three straight blonde hairs on my blouse - yuk! I have brown curly hair and If these clothes were just cleaned whay are they covered in hair??  no thanks, i'm not going back to Delia's!

I like these sort of "mom & pop" spots, small and intimate setting.  Great pizza!  I always enjoy the veggie pizza with jalapenos, oh so good!  And mu hubby loves the suicide wings, but we've tried almost everything off of the menu and you CANNOT go wrong.  Prices rock too!

It's ok for the $.... But nothing to rave about!  I make a better sub sandwich at home... And the "fresh" fruit cup is never fresh!  Ugh I hate a dirty looking crew too!  Employees need to clean up

Boring!  This underground layer is almost spooky, all the surrounding hallways smell like thrift shop or like old hospital! Idk but I don't like it so much. And the little old lady cook is a efffing grouch!  Screw this place and screw my DES cafeteria too!   But when u are starving almost anything tastes good I guess...

No thanks!  I've ended up at charlies way too many times, because the "boys" always wanna go! But In my 15 visits to charlies I cannot think of even one time where I actually had fun! Never!   Stupid music and just all wrong!  No thanks Charlie!

Marty, you'd like this spot.  This is the first "gay" bar I went to in Phoenix back in 2004 when I moved here ( Matty Yatzack took me here)..  on a Friday happy hour.  And since then have visited many other gay-happy hour spots but I have to say Amsterdam's is by far the best!  You'd like their xtra dirty martini!  Let's go, It's not far from my work.   And you don't have to be gay to enjoy this place....  It's a nice casual crowd, not stuffy at all.  And great music too!

Only been once but feel unsure - hence the two stars. Really I'd like to slice it down the middle and do 2.5 but oh well.  The veggie lasagna & linguine with white clam sauce that we had was pretty on point. Dare I say divine. The service was also pretty freaking excellent. But the thing is... How u say... Ok I'll just say it. AMBIANCE WAS A BUMMER, sincerely! like the gaudy type of decor brought a stuffiness to the experience. Also the bizarre eighties elevator music was pretty loud and depressing at the same time. Truly id give this place a 4-5 star had it not been for the lack of atmosphere. Such a depressing setting. Too bad cause the food, pricing and service was A-ok!!! This restaurant is confused. Doesn't know if it wants to be chill, hip & cool OR upscale class act. It's neither...  It even confused me & the hubby. Sorry. Just keeping it real :)

I only go here because I don't have too many choices walking distance from work... But it's not the bomb!  It's average Mexican food.  But see I'm Mexican and cook original mexican food all the time. I promise u both my Spanish rice and my refried beans are way better than what these people serve up...

OMG I JUST CAME FROM "THE PLACE"...  And I'm stufffffed! EXCELLENT TASTING, BIG PORTIONS OF FOOD! EXCELLENT FAST SERVICE! PRICES WERE REASONABLE! I only had to wait 10 minutes for a table.. not bad!  And so well worth it! The only reason they don't get a five star is because they don't serve alcohol...  I love a bloody mary or a mimosa with my brunch!  But this is definitely a favorite for me... It's only like 2 miles from my home too, so awesome!

Huge fan, we eat lunch here weekly. Have tried every salad on the menu, all very good. Prices are ok, and service is pretty much always excellent. I did find one little hair in my salad once, just once. have forgiven them, but i never forget, if this happens again then I'll complain.  Also the biggest negative, is that on two different occasions I have witnessed the homeless walk in - holding their own cup from the street and walk straight to the fountain drink & iced teas AND TOTALLY JUST HELP THEMSELVES TO THE REFRESHMENTS AND THEN WALK OUT. Like I said I have seen this twice now and so I don't understand how the employees aren't seeing this and stopping it. I feel bad for the filthy, smelly, homeless crackies that are thirsty.. But seriously I don't know what kind of filth, bugs, fleas, ticks, dandruff, dry ashy skin cells that their shedding and dragging in with them, and the filthy hands and also their drag in their oh not so welcoming aromas!!!!!!!!!!!!! yuk. actually now that i re-read my true words I feel like changing the 4 to a 3 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ugh the truth hurts.  anyways yea this is factual and btw the hubby always only gets the same turkey & brie cheese sandwich - HE GOES NUTS FOR IT - ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THESE GUYS ARE THE BEST OF THE BEST!!! I visit Dillon's all the time, weekly for sure and sometime 2-3 times a week! Yes it's that great!  You get delicious food, awesome service, reasonable prices and the Dillon's crew is oh so welcoming & friendly!  I love you Rich, Heather & Joey!!! My favorite is the pulled pork sandwich & also the burnt ends with Cajun BBQ sauce, yummy! Plus they have nightly happy hour drink specials! Can't beat that, I've recommended this place to all my family & friends. They all love it too! Dillon's you rock! Thank you for coming to my neighborhood!

I'm not even sure why I'm doing this to myself, blame boredom! Ok so I've only been to an Applebee's like four times in the last 11 years(that's 4 too many times), that's how long I've been living in AZ. However, This specific location has got to be the absolute worst. It smells bad when you walk in, like some old dive bar smell. The lunch I had today gave me a tummy ache almost instantly(some sort of fish&chips mockery)! Barfffffolaaaa! For the record I only ended up at Applebee's because the pizza place near by "santisi brothers"(had a groupon I needed to redeem) was closed at 1pm and obviously I only had the one hour to grab food. I felt the need to clear my name - I'd never just choose to dine at AppleBs. Anyway, the point is, my final thoughts:  If you are even just a little cool, smart, good looking, classy, fancy, hip and/or awesome THEN APPLEBEES IS NOT FOR YOU. I'm of the opinion that this establishment is for more of the trailer living, nascar loving, country listening & lower classes if you will.   Hey that's just me, my opinion, take it or leave it no worries. I do like to keep it real tho

Love love love this pizza joint! I liked it when it was just food. You know, pizza & pop! But now that they've started making their own beer, well it's love. Try the fatty slims, a must - great tasting while strong    And quenching. Currently enjoying a growler of the chocolate stout! Soo good!    Fab pizza 24/7!  And the family that run this place are always super nice and friendly, real chill!  It's a small place so I wouldn't recommend eating there if you're 6 or more. But take the goods home, you won't be disappointed

Walked in - Place was completely empty. That should've been our clear sign - to run. But no, we sat, there was only one worker there (she seated us and took our order as well, hence the title of "worker")  no other employees to be seen. But she was nice and said she made a killer bloody mary. so we asked for two.. THEY WERE PERFECTLY PREPPED, Seriously delicious. The pizza we ordered never arrived, so asked for the pizza to go, and she said we still couldn't have the pizza to go because it was in the oven and needed 15 more minutes! lol we had to get back to work! um no thanks lady , just cancel the order., so had the two rounds of drinks and left - the bill was only $25.00 for 4 drinks. normal i guess! anyway i feel like the food shouldn't have taken so long since we were literally the only customers in the restaurant. so for that reason the 2 stars, i don't really feel like giving them a second try since it was an uninteresting place anyway.

Awesome venue! Small enough that no matter where u r standing u have a decent view of stage/performance. Saw the English beat here and we loved it. Servers are all beautiful young girls, bring your A game and your confidence with you ladies

Nothing here to see. After three failed visits I can confirm that this restaurant is crappy. Food lame, portions are xtra lame. Prices steep for what they're serving. Now just to be fair; this location is in the middle of the hood. So perhaps a nicer area puts out better food and service idk

Have been here twice now, it's neat decor & ambiance. Pretty great food, service and overall dining experience. Luv the thin crust on all their pizzas, you can tell they use fine quality & fresh ingredients. The only reason I can't give it a five star rating is because I'm a piggy, I do like larger portions, my husband & I ate everything on our plates and each had desert as well. And we were both of the opinion that we could've used more food. I think we will for sure order appetizer before the meal next time

I TESTIFY!!!!!  Amanda up at the bar just served me up the BEST margarita I've ever had in my life!  And I've had many in all my years :) Ask for the "inferno" margarita. It's bomb. On point! You can taste the cucumber, the jalapeños oh so subtly but there's that nice smooth sweetness that comes thru all in one, omg DELISH!  I'll have another!
