First time coming here;  and I was really AMAZED by the quality of food, quickness of service, and decent pricing!  I ordered a nice sausage/italian beef sandwich; got a side of marinara and some au jus sauce... and the lady got a eggplant parm with spaghetti and a side salad.  Her food was a huge portion; and looked pretty damn delicious.   My sandwich, and I kid you not, was a huge, monstrous carnivores dream!  The marinara is some of the tastiest sauce I've had in a long time as well.  This sandwich was impossible to finish;  the sausage specifically was amazing.   Im not in vicinity to this location usually, so Im gonna try the tempe location soon; probably for pizza as thats a good barometer as to quality of food.  But its not easy making a good sandwich like the one I had, it was obviously fresh ingredients and someone back in that kitchen knows what the heck they are doing.    Fit for a king, budgeted for a peasant.  Im down with that!!!  Rosatis' was a pleasant surprise as I'm definitely hitting them up again.

Hmm,  been eating here off and on for the last several years;   and I've noticed a very definitive decline in quality of the pizza since they expanded this location.  The last two times I have ordered, once was for delivery; the other was store pick-up.    Its a battle of pizza in Tempe, and when i spend almost 20 bucks for a pizza; I expect it to be pretty tasty.  The delivered pizza was not, in both sauce and toppings, it was nothing spectacular; and the delivery took almost an hr. Which, might of contributed to the pizza not being very good.  My most recent pizza, was in my assuming that a picked up pizza would be fresh and better than my delivery was. I was wrong; the white pizza (no sauce, olive oil and ricotta,) was possibly worse than the delivery. And, for 20 bucks I could of gotten 2 pizzas at jamies pizzeria in the neighborhood that I KNOW would of been better than this.    Oh well, I don't know if their expansion has led to the quality going down, or that the place has many different locations now and as such whatever was special is no longer so, but its very obvious to me that whatever I thought was SO GOOD about venezias prior, is not. And I won't be trying it again.

aside from the website issues (minimum order amount is faulty, and it just being down or not functional...)  this little place has the best chinese food delivery in tempe.  quick, and suprisingly fresh and tasty.  also, big portions.  i remember years ago, i lived right next door and it wasn't as good. on a whim, after a few poor meals from other chinese places round this side of town, i decided to order online again.  now, i usually order 1-3 times a week, and unfortunately have to call it in as the website has gone sour (hence 4 stars, not 5.)     the fried dumplings (potstickers,) are really legit, and the lunch combos are awesome. ive tried most of them.    the hotnsour isn't so great, but if you need a quick fix of chinese food (esp the lo mein,  and the blackbeansauce or broccoli stuff, are great...)    i work about 3 miles from the place, and at lunch i can get delivery usually under 30 mins.

The best neighborhood bar and restaurant...  I've been coming here for at least a decade.  I bring my family here;  from fiances to gfs to wakes... toasting life and love lost.      What makes Caseys so special is that the staff is personable;  not in a corporate way of pretending to 'love' you, but in an honest, sometimes frank, or even humorous style.     The food is always good;  its been a rare occasion in ten plus years that I haven't be satisfied or stuffed with the goods!!   And just because we are in the desert, don't stray from the fish; I've had all sorts of goodness here; look for the specials and try something a bit diff than just wings (which are great,) or a burger (one of the best burger deals in town.)  I always try a bit of whatever dessert is being served, and the menu is also flexible as to what you desire.  Don't want fries w/ yr fish n chips? Get a cup or bowl of the delicious clam chowder.  Order a caesar salad with no croutons and some tomatos.  No big deal;  and the food is good.  I have had days where I hit up the ol' caseys for lunch, and by nightfall i come back for a late dinner. They even serve til 1am!  In tempe?  Hell yes!  Every night at caseys, especially Fri/sat, you will see an eccentric, albeit young and hip, mix of people.  As the days' regulars give way to the night,  the tattooed, loud, and sexy make their way to crowd the outside patio.  Its rare that you could feel out of place unless you are expecting yr average hooters... there is a air of unexpected joy, of raising a pint of guinness (which is poured astutely,) and of seeing and meeting old and new friends alike.

at least 2-3 times a week we order pizza and garlic knots at my tattoo shop...   jamies pizza is consistently good. and quick delivery!  cheap too... cant go wrong.  try the salami on a pie!  its amazing.  ON oct 7th, after waiting on a 2hr delivery, paying 16 dollars, and getting the delivery screwed up and being served what looked like vomit in a box, i UNFORTUNATELY have to change this review to 1 star.

I'm one of those persons who will eat chinese food 2 times a day if given the chance;  good chinese, bad... quick or fancy.  Doesn't matter much to me, and as such Volcano Buffet could of been MUCH worse and I wouldn't of minded. So, its become a rather pleasant surprise as to how much I love this place.  I usually try to arrive by 10:30-11am as thats when its empty and the food is freshly arriving to the main buffet area.  In that way, I KNOW I am getting the best food I can.  The price for the buffet I find to be just fine as I eat an insane amount of food from here;   if you are used to panda express sort of americanized chinese food, and pay for their meager portions, then you should be uber excited that its all you can eat and the quality, in my mind and taste, is much better.  I have it down to a science, what I eat here.   The actual chinese dishes are quite good.  I don't eat the items that are here for those who don't actually want vegetables or chinese food.   So, if you want a review of the pizza or chicken wings, thats not what to come here for.  Grab some volcano chicken,  beef w brocolli, steamed rice, chow mein, hot sour soup,  lil' potstickers... and keep going!   I usually stray away from shellfish at a place like this, so I can't speak for that,  but if you try toe kungpao chicken, the black pepper chicken,  spicy pork... YEAH!  damn good!  Over to the dessert section, you have nice fruit,  pastries, ice cream, jello, and pudding.  My secret favorite is the tapioca and one of the fried lil' donuts.    And when I'm done with dessert, I grab another bowl of hotsour or wonton soup.  Volcano buffet is perfectly fine for chinese food in the valley;  I haven't had a bad experience here yet, and Ive been by at least 10 times in past few months.  Cheers!

..calling me after 45 mins of when i called in an order and explaining that yr held up by the HEALTH INSPECTOR and cant deliver my pizza yet, well... just give that nice cold disgusting pizza to the inspector, im sure they will enjoy it. THATS MY REVIEW for devils pizza factory...  And delivery driver, 'DONT BE MAD' is not how you talk to a potential customer, one who orders 1-2 times a week from 2 different businesses to get pizza.  awful customer service.
