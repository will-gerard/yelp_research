Sunday, February 22, 2015   I was greeted by a wonderful staff Sunday morning, I had some questions about the contract that made me hesitate to sign up for a year membership at 20 bucks a month. I was waiting for the following day where I could speak directly to the general manager of the club. So I purchased a 24 hour pass and was told included everything except tanning and red light  treatment. When I returned in the evening as I walked in I was greeted by an employee that informed me that my pass did not have a timestamp and therefore he did not want to let me come into the club. (I later found the timestamp on the receipt it took me two seconds) after some discussion he agreed to let me come in and exercise however when I asked if I could do the hydromassage or the chair massage I was informed that it was not included in the 24 hour pass. I said that the people in the morning said that I could try it... He asked me... Well... Did you try it? I asked why he was being so mean, he informed me that he was not being mean and he decided to allow me to try one of them, and wanted to know which one I would like to try again. With that I excused myself to the restroom because I was frustrated and didn't want to say or do something I would regret later. After a few moments I left the facility and was able to avoid confrontation with the employee.  I will be in contact with the company to get a refund.  Update I was informed that it's not a 24 hour pass but rather expires at midnight and I believe it's called a day pass.  The front desk controls how much time you get on each of the black card benefits 10 minutes in the sun tanning booth 10 minutes in the massage chair 7 minutes in the hydromassage bed  This didn't seem like enough time just when you started to get comfortable time was up  My opinion is... It's okay, it's not a full gym with all amenities it's a stripped-down gym with basically just weights. They make you think you're getting a good deal with the black card but the times for the massage chairs tanning bed and Hydro bed are too short to have any real impact  $20 for a day pass seemed to be high. It was the best 20 bucks I've spent because I really got to realize how long and how much I would utilize the black card.  I will not be joining the gym I would rather pay a little more and get a lot more.

I need to preface this 1 I love spicy Mexican food 2 I have eaten Mexican food all around the United States. This is not my first rodeo is what I'm trying to say As I walked in the door the manager shuffle his feet quickly to meet me and take my order. He greeted me with a smile and made me feel real comfortable kind of like an old friend. I asked what was in the Machaca burrito he was very detailed as to all the ingredients I was really quite impressed. I was impressed that he knew all the ingredients and that he wasn't upset or short with me for even asking. I asked for it to be spicy and it was perfect I had the green enchilada style my machaca burrito I had spicy green salsa everything was wonderful fresh and tasty I would highly recommend!!!! It only took 4 min to get my food. :-)
