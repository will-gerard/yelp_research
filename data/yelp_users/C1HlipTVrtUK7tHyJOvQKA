I don't even understand how this place has an 3.5 star rating, this place  by far is the worst ramen I've had.  I've never thought package ramen could taste better then this so called authentic ramen.   Ramen noodle hard  Tonkotsu broth terrible I was lost of what kind of broth this was even suppose to be.   Portion size very small Togo bowl

I usually only write on here to let you know if it is either really shitty or really good! Hands down this is my new favorite Korean BBQ place to eat at now. You will not be disappointed! I recommend the Gabli,spicy pork belly, and the hot plate pancake!
