I ordered an item through wayfair and received a call for delivery from a Brian. He sounded nice on the voice message but when I ended up speaking with him and trying coordinate shipping options, he was very rude. It seemed like he didn't want to help me and came off as condescending when I was just seeking clarity on their process. He kept saying things like "but that's not guaranteed" or "I don't know I'm not the one delivering it" or "you would know better than me." I ended up telling him to put me down for a 6-10am window since it was the only realistic option and he couldn't guarantee they would be delivering on the next weeekend. He said he needed to just call me back but at that point i decided i would call next week in hopes i would get someone with better customer service. He called back but didn't leave a message. Driver showed up at 730 when I wasn't home.  The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the contracted driver Michael was accommodating and waited for me. It was an easy delivery, I just wish my experience with hot shot had been less frustrating.

Purchased a 60 inch sharp led TV at Tempe marketplace, got it home, and it was cracked. Went back the next day to this store to do an exchange after reading bad best buy reviews all day about them not taking back cracked screens, and they made it very simple and quick here for me. Eased my nerves immediately. They even offered to open the other tv, check it out, and repackage it.

I was told by one sassy barista named Andrew to come on here and say good things. So..good things. And I mean it.    Gold bar is never a disappointment. My roommates and I live around the corner and just started going more often. Delicious drinks, great atmosphere, and funny and kind coffee-makers.   Sometimes it gets a little crowded inside, but when you find a table with an adorable boating or oddly decorated lamp, it's totttally worth it! :)

Delicious but SO slow. Took me 25 minutes to get through the drive thru on a weekday.

Saw this little shop while driving in phoenix. Stopped on a whim and am SO glad that we did. Very creative stuff and the prices are not bad at all! Talked to Leonardo and we were mesmerized by him- full of creativity, great vibes, and a kind heart. Don't come across people like him or places like this very often- check it out if you are in the area, or if you aren't!

Love the location (not the parking but thats a lot of places in phoenix). Yummy cocktails and the fattoush salad was a delight. Snuck a bite of my friend's side mac and cheese and it tasted like something I would want to eat every day for the rest of my life. Great service, cool atmosphere.

Moved in yesterday and while my experience here is fresh, I have lived in a lot of places, and never been as impressed as I was with the customer service here. They were fun, professional, and so welcoming. Lots of cool things about this place. So excited to be living in this complex. Especially knowing there is a staff that wants to help make it a great experience. Hawke in particular was super helpful. The energy radiated off of him! :)

Walked in at just before 915pm when they close at 10pm. Tried to order a hot sub and the guy working told me that it was going to be 20-30 minutes for any hot sub because they'd have to turn back on the grill and they already cleaned it. He seemed annoyed but there was 45 freaking minutes left before they closed. I have worked in food service long enough to know that's not exactly the best customer service. It also eliminates half of what we could order and made me cranky.
