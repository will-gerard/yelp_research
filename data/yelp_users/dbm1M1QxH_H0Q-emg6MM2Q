I used to love Xplicit a few years ago. However when I went last night the manager was cursing out the bouncers about some drunk girl. Then when I went to sit with two of my male friends while waiting on my female friend I was accused of prostitution and kicked out. I had a tab open at the bar and security acted as if he didn't want to let me get my card back from the bar. The security guy told me women don't come in the club to sit down and  have a good time. He also cursed out another lady patron accusing her of prostitution because she was a woman in the club. I had an Xplicit card in my hand. Security took the card and read it then went on a rant about some guy named Harold who's name is on the card doesn't work there anymore. "Sorry Mr. Security dude that your club's card has wrong info. I don't know you from a box of cereal so you can keep your F bombs to yourself." It was disgraceful! Pretty club but horribly sexist men that work there. I will never return to that club. I do not suggest women go there. Obviously we aren't meant to be patrons. We are only meant to show our breast at Xplicit.

I had a wonderful time at Trampalina!! The customer service is amazing!! Tonia literally brought out all of their black dresses for me to try on for A Runway Competition!! The store is very clean and full of awesome clothing and accessories! I also purchased a fabulous hot pink Mitch Wayne purse! The best way I can describe Trampalina Fashion is a Treasure Chest of Awesome!!

Was greeted at the door, very clean, associates were on task, no clothing or shoes were on the floor, everything was organized, and there is a great selection to shop from. I will be back!
