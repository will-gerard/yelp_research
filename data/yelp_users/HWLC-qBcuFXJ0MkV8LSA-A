Located on the east side of 7th St. just south of Thomas.  Another homey little cottage with hardwood floors.  Consistently good food at moderate prices keeps this place busy the only days of the week they're open for dinner, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  They have a strict reservations policy now, due to increased popularity in a small space.  They feature things like Lasagna, Pork chops, Stew - comfort food with a kick, and they do it well.  Close to downtown, makes it a great spot to be before an evenings event.  If you notify your wait staff right off, they do a good job of getting you on your way on time.

For fresh American faire with a French twist this homey little cottage with hardwood floors will tickle your fancy!  The owner is also the head Chef and the menu changes regularly.  Fresh salads featuring a little fruit and nuts is my favorite aperitif.  Seafood is usually featured, along with chicken, light cream sauces and nicely sized portions that a girl can actually finish.  This is a great place for a romantic dinner, or girls night out before the theatre, or intimate dinner with another couple.  I believe they now have a liquour license that allows for wine service and maybe more?!  A back room is available for larger groups, call ahead to reserve it.  Reservations recommended, in general.  Only open for dinner.  Moderate to upscale prices.

Dr. Paul Dickerson has been putting this body *back* (pun always intended) together for many moons!   Decades ago when I first began feeling painful work related symptoms of carpal tunnel in both wrists, his adjustments relieved the pain from the get go!  I credit him for the fact that I have never needed carpal tunnel surgery, as long as I get it adjusted.    I have continued to follow him for all these years from several location moves in the valley to his current Central Phoenix location at which he's been grounded in for more than a decade now.  Dr. Dickerson continues to straighten me out throughout the years of which has ranged from everything like a severe knee injury, to a slightly dislocated shoulder, to body strain resulting from marathon training, a sprained ankle and of course back injuries and so many more.  His adjustments are not too soft nor too strong - plus it 'holds' well!  And if you're feeling in a "tight spot" his masseuse can get you out of it. The clinic has a well rounded assortment of equipment to help cure what ails you too.  The friendly front desk personnel will make you feel at home and help you navigate insurance too.  Dr. Dickerson ranks among my first choices of go-to-guys in the event of any injury I incur.  He has never let me down; I always find profound relief in his care!

Located on the SW corner of 16th St. and Bethany Home Rd. in a strip mall.  Great casual dining in a soft desert toned ambiance; ample portions of really good home cooking served with flair (presentation is everything) at moderate prices.  What more could you ask for? Oh, wine you say?  Well here you go - a comfortable little bar area (yes, cocktails too) in which to chill out at day's end and catch the ball game of the day or vent about work.  Or alternately makes a great place to do business or dare I say - meet a date?

"Been there - done that", with this discrepant racket.  Besides the mediocre wash jobs - the customer service, in a blatant word - SUCKS.  First, they threw out my clothes that were slated to be taken to the dry cleaners.  That car washing cost me nearly $300.  I boycotted the place after the owners claimed no responsiblity.    Then, in a desperate moment over a year later - I had an oil change and a wash just before leaving town on a Sunday morning road trip - nothing else was open.  I was told that the transmission fluid was low and it needed to be filled.  Halfway up the hill on I-17 North there was  pinkish crap blowing out of the tail pipe all over the back of the SUV and the idiot light on the dash indicated trouble.  The diagnosis given to me by the car repairman enroute was the transmission fluid had been over filled.  Nice.  Of course, Danny's Car Wash was not responsible.  I now done with them - figuring I got off lucky with the vehicle still in tact.    But, you'd think I was from East Texas - the third time is really the charm.  The car was "For Sale" and I had painted this fact on the outside of the back windows in water soluble paint.  In my final heinous act - I ran it thru this car wash, calling attention to the windows to the incipient attendant.  He assured me it was "No problem.  We'll get you all taken care of."  The car wash complete and not outside my realm of expectation.  It was rendered to me with remnants of paint still plainly on the windows and the attendent present shrugged his shoulders.  When I pressed the issue, he suggested I to speak to the manager.  The rudimentary attendant was no where to be found.  The manager appeared.  Cut to the chase - they didn't even try to reclean the windows.  In the final scene I was driving out of the lot with dirty windows and the entire outside staff flagrantly geering and laughing!     I know... sounds like the dumb chick in the horror film - but I think it's safe to say - that was the last time I left tracks in that driveway.  If I could deduct stars from this business, I'd give them MINUS - 5 stars.  There's my experience and opinion of Danny's Family Calamity Car Wash.    Check out Quick n Clean on 16th Street and Colter - Fabulous!  Inexpensive.  Excellent customer service!

Located at the SW corner of 40th St. and Campbell.  This entire corner is now owned by an enterprising young couple who ingeniously converted the old post office to a wine bar featuring fresh aperitifs and lite gourmet pizza!  They did such a fab job on the remodel they were written up in Architects Digest some 8 years ago (or more) when they opened.  It's become something of a low key meeting hub with "great date" written all over the place.  Any given night of the week you will find this place a' buzz!  So plan on a wait, unless it's early in the evening or very early in the week - like Monday.  Open for lunch and open late; again with some candied confections that could make a girl on a diet cry.  Look cute, because this is where the beautiful people hang out in Phoenix, sans attitude.  Moderately priced.

Look for the huge antique sign floating above the two story building of windows that give this place a retro cosmopolitan look.  Inside, 'the after dinner mint' green walls, you'll find a baby grand piano probably sporting a pleasant and gifted young lady tickling the ivories.  Note the huge brandy snifter at her feet awaiting gracious greenbacks.  This is a great spot for light eats and (my favorite) desserts!  What began as a bakery now offers in addition to delectable fresh bread; fabulous brie and fruit platters, along with fresh wholesome salads that would make a lion change it's carnivorous ways and fill his tummy.  I believe a nice wine list is featured here as well.  Open for lunch; open late and in great proximity for apres theatre treats makes for the perfect spot to "oooohhhh..." about the latest show.  Bring a sweater, I usually find this place a little chilly for my thin skin.  Moderately priced.

Located on the west side of 16th St. between Osborn and Thomas Road in a tiny old strip mall in the heart of the 'hood, it's not called Barrio for nothing.  This has gone from great neighborhood find to being written up in the New York Times as a "must do" when in Phoenix, so be early or be prepared to wait.  The food and atmosphere def have a funky yet festive, artsy feel.  The food is along the similar vein of Padres; but featuring a guacamole appetizer that shouldn't be missed as it's mixed for you fresh at your table and served with big round chips ...yum!  Again with the desert ...some chocolate creation to die for!  Moderately priced.

Located on the north side of Camelback, east of 7th St. (right next to the defunct Toys R Us)  For a quality cold draft beer and good home style meat and potatoes ("must have" potatoes in an Irish Pub) lunch or dinner this is a winner.   A kitzy, cozy, neighborhood hangout - come in your jeans and tell stories - walk home, or take the bus since it's right on the bus route, if you've done too many 16oz. curls.  The action here on St. Patrick's Day can't be beat.

Stained glass windows and brightly colored walls with walnut trim greet you upon entering the main room/bar of this neighborhood hot spot.  The various rooms of this cottage style restaurant keep it intimate, but the bustle of activity in the main room keep a lively spirit moving thru out.  Family owned and run, these people greet you like you're friends.  From Thursday to Saturday evenings you hear the festive sound of the featured musicians of the week, with of course a Latin beat. Great food and something for everyone with fresh salads, entrees with spice; and cream sauces, seafood, pork chops - you name it.  Word to the sweet tooths' - do not pass up dessert.  The flan in this place is the best I've ever had.  Moderately priced.

Located on south side of Thomas and 5th Av. Across from the hospital.  A not so typical cafe featuring typical, and not so typical cafe eats.  For instance Chile and a  Grilled Cheese Sandwich.  Or  Eggs Benedict, or Spinach Salad with red onions and bacon.  David Charns, the owner is friendly and conscious of quality food.  Open early for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  You can feel well protected with our Boys in Blue frequenting the joint.  For intermittent entertainment, a one man band is sometimes featured on Friday evenings.  Cocktails available.  And if you're interested in checking out First Fridays Art Walk in downtown Phoenix, featured once a month - they're on the bus route.  Super casual atmosphere, good food served up quick with a little smak makes this place fetching.  Be sure to say "Hi" to the dishy blonde at the front door and check out the outfit of the day!

Camelback Toyota doesn't have this big, beautiful, new facility on 16th Street, for nothing.  I know I put more than my share of my hard earned money into that building. The last time I left tracks in this garage was after I was up-sold a ton of work that my SUV did not need at the time, to the tune of some nearly $2,000 - when I had gone in for a regular oil change.  The car repair sales associate, Damion, seemed surprised when I requested the replaced parts after they finished all the work he "recommended" (scare tactic is more accurate).  One freshly replaced part "...couldn't be found."  (Interesting, in light of the fact that they had just finished it.)  The rest of the parts didn't seem to show enough wear to warrant replacement, in my opinion.  So, I took them around for a couple of other neutral opinions.  Even un-prefaced by explanation, those opinions all concurred with mine.    I challenged the need for the work performed with Damion, at Camelback Toyota.  And although I didn't press charges in court (but did consider it, just didn't have any extra time to deal with it at the time) - this formerly, quite loyal, customer will surely never return to this "establishment" and now they have a really sour review too.     However, I have found solace in my car repair needs at 3A Auto Service in Sunnyslope.  At this well established, family owned business, I am not treated as "fresh meat" because I am a woman embarking on an oil change sans a male figure for protection.  To date, they have been honest about the work they have done and have been like a "husband" in that they provide a heads up as to what to expect for repairs or maintenance in the next few months.  This could be a grand, auto, love affair!  Rather than an auto affair that cost me grands!!  I give 3A Auto Service a 5 star rating - girls, you gotta go there!

Some cupcakes look sooo delicious, your mouth waters at the sight of them.  Only to take a bite and realize the disappointment of an average-joe; dressed up for prom.  Like you're gonna give away your sacred calories on this?!  Not so, with Cupcakes by Design!!  It's love at first bite as these delightful, delectables, deliver with as much promise as it looks.  Smooth, creamy icings swirled atop the soft, moist cake with just the right amount of sweet in both - plus to find the secret cream filling in the middle of the cake!  These confections will have you begging to go all the way!  I have been going steady with these cakes since we met (soon after they opened), now I want for no others.  Call for your first dream date today!

I got a great deal through Living Social for a VIP Hand Wash and Polymer Paint Sealant.  The work was done at the downtown location.  Instead of "Wow" it was more like "really?".  I contacted the owner, Ryan, telling him of my experience.  He was quick to email back, apologized, and offered to have it redone for no charge at the Mesa location; and to follow up with a 'sit-down' with the downtown attendant. A few days later I headed out to Mesa - spoke to the manager (and brother of Ryan) and briefly told him the story and handed him the email exchange.  No problem.  They got a guy on it soon.  I stepped across the street for a bite.  When I returned the SUV was SPARKLING CLEAN, SHINY bumpers and body and completely BUG FREE.  WINDOWS were nice and STREAK FREE.  Inside was thoroughly vacuumed, CLEAN and shiny but not dripping in Amorall nor over drenched in fragrance.  "WOW!!!" - now that's what I'm talkin' about!

I'm a girl who can live on soup so this has become my new, favorite, go-to place!  With about a dozen soups to choose from and a dozen fresh salads too!  I've tried them all and each soup is rich and flavorful plus made in-house daily; my favorite is Lobster Bisque (with real lobster bits)!  The only caveat, I wish they would use a gluten free thickener in the soups.  The service line is usually quick and efficient along with a clean environment to dine in.  I highly recommend this place for lunch and casual weekday dinners!

Recently, when a friend's good friend flew in from New York, for her birthday, "extras" (myself and another girl) were called in to round out the celebration.  The birthday girl, a vegetarian, had requested seafood and with our party coming from all parts of the Valley we landed in Cuttlefish by Yelp reviews and proximity.  Lucky for us!    We were greeted like family by the friendly host and seated promptly.  Then Gino attended to us by offer of drink, aperitif, then menu suggestions.  A seasoned waiter takes his trade to heart, sets the tone, and guides the dining experience and his mastery showed as Gino established a great rapport with the four of us before he glided into the entrees du jour.    Our dishes ranged from large fresh salads with divine presentation to Lobster Ravioli layered in light but creamy, rich in tomato sauce, of which I savored every bite.  The birthday girl indulged in her favorite fish filet, which was plated beautifully along side the potato and vegetable accompaniments.  When service is done right the waitron will enhance the event, becoming an auxiliary companion you look forward to have drop in, in addition to their assistance.  Of which is easy to do when things are going well but Gino's mastery of his profession showed through to the end.  How many girls, with only an ounce of liqueur between all of them, does it take to divvy and decipher the bill with tip?!    Apparently, four is not enough, and it takes a waiter too.  Gino was very patient as he counted cash and recounted and accounted for all debits.  I'm sure it was good humor for any onlookers.  Thank goodness Gino kept his sense of humor too!  We had a great meal and great experience at Cuttlefish.
