Instead of a review, here is the letter I wrote AJs about my experience in their store. They NEVER responded,  and now I can no longer, in good conscience,  shop there because of their apathy.  "I'm writing, because I had an experience at your store that I just can't stop thinking about. I visited last Sunday, Oct. 30th- close to closing time. As I was checking out, the cashier (a younger man- he looked like he might be of Latino decent) was incredibly polite and professional. However, I had a very negative/offensive experience with another employee of your store that appeared to have just finished her shift and was waiting in line behind me to make a purchase (she was a middle aged woman, with dyed blond hair and heavy eye make-up). As my friend and I were making our purchase, we briefly chatted with the kind cashier. I, in error, went to the wrong place to check out. Your cashier made a friendly comment about how at Costco they have arrows to guide people and that it was an easy mistake for me to go to the wrong spot. It was just friendly rapport. I suppose he was trying to ease my mind in case I felt embarrassed, which I appreciated the gesture.   Anyhow, while he was talking with my friend and myself, the woman interrupts and starts loudly saying to the cashier helping us, and I am QUOTING her, "Not MY Costco, you live with 'needy' people! You go to the 'needy' people Costco. My Costco is beautiful because there aren't any 'needy' people there. I live in a different city than YOU. I don't live amongst 'needy' people. We're not needy where I live like YOUR city".   Sadly, I am not exaggerating this in anyway. I was completely appalled by the lack of  basic manners.   This woman is completely unprofessional. Regardless of her personal feelings towards wherever the young man lives or her delusional superiority over "needy" people... laughable, since she is working at a grocery store but that's beside the point. I can not believe she would have the audacity to speak to this young man in this manner in front of CUSTOMERS.   Despite her rude, insensitive and unprofessional comments, the young man remained gracious and kind and never said and unkind word or even gave an unkind glance while this woman was attempting to belittle and humiliate him in front of customers. She is lucky that I was too shocked by her behavior to say something at the time, because I am and was completely disgusted. This has left a lasting impression, a negative one to say the least, and I certainly hope that you have a talk with this woman about basic manners and conduct- even if I wasn't present- her behavior is basically harassment and no person should have to deal with such ignorance and insensitivity."

Love the basement bar. Nice atmosphere, bartenders know how to make decent cocktails and the Chile Relleno was gringofied, but tasty. Had some meat thing the bartender recommended- it was ok, but no love from me.  I definitely recommend this place for a nice evening out.

Beautiful place, nice ambiance. Ok drinks. Music could be better. The waitress was dressed very provocatively (large breasts falling out of the top of her dress- showing her panties each time she bent over- which was often)- it appeared that many ladies on dates felt uncomfortable, arms crossed immediately with the men looking at the ground... Probably more uncomfortable for the guys really- because one wrong glance or blink and that date is over!   If this is the vibe Merc Bar is going for then... well done I guess.  I will say, it is awkward when a girls large boobs are coming out of her top and she keeps bending down with her chest in your date's face... kudos to her for being an attractive young lady, but it's a bit much when it makes the guests uncomfortable.   Also,  as one woman left her table to use the restroom, I watched the waitress flirt and stroke her husband's arm up and down as she gave him the check... I have a feeling if the wife saw that.... well, I'm happy she didn't, because you just don't know how people are gonna react to that disrespectful, intrusive behavior. It knocked the place down a couple notches- not quite Hooters vibe or strip club lounge- Maybe Champagne room? I really did wonder if I got up to use the restroom, would this girl come over to feel my guy up too? I didn't like that one bit. It wasn't a good feeling to have out with your significant other- and unfortunately, this is the memory I so strongly took away. Then again, it was also interesting watching the guy that somehow ended up on a date with a transexual squirm in the corner as she insisted on playing with his hair and trying to kiss on his neck... That must have been an internet date, lol!  Also, regarding the service, each time we would ask questions about the drinks the waitress would have to go ask the bartender. It's a specialty cocktail lounge- we aren't liquor micro-biologists asking for a chemical analysis of their concoctions- just regular basic questions. It would have been nice if she would have had some level of knowledge and training- given the niche and price points. \   All in all- I remember when this place was hot, back in the day- when I don't think I was even old enough to drink. It's still a nice place, but there are so many more options in this town now. Urbanity in Phoenix is progressing- gotta keep up with the times Merc Bar. When my barista knowns more about the soymilk in my Latte than this chick knows about a fresh squeezed lemon in a cocktail we have an issue.   As for the drinks... They were okay. I wasn't blown away by the choices. We ended up going to Sidebar afterwards- I love their muddled blueberrry whiskey sour- house made. Delicious! The drinks were better at Sidebar and the vibe was a little more modern less stripclub/2001 Scottsdale nightclub.  Sorry Merc.

Took my dog here today. Made it clear that the dog needed to be shampooed. Petsmart quoted me $50 to $60. Casper's quoted $60 and then when I got their they said it should really be $120, but they'd go ahead and do it for the $60 they quoted.  So, I go to pick up my dog and they say that they used the hair vacuum thing, and I said she really needed to be shampooed. Then the woman claimed that the dog was shampooed. I could see that the dogs white tail was still yellow and its belly was in some spots as well. (The dog was filthy as it was recently rescued from a neglectful home). Anyhow, I didn't want to argue- I could tell I was being lied to. People really should read up on body language. It's no mystery when people are full of shit.   Anyhow, I look down and my dogs foot is bleeding. Like dripping blood all over the floor. I'm shocked and they tell me that they clipped her nails too short. I'm thinking, this is why I came in to a professional and paid $60- so that the doggie wouldn't be hurt. The woman exclaims, "She'll live."  Obviously, I'm not going back and I strongly recommend that you take your dog elsewhere... They'll live.

OMG, they have food here? I had no idea... ... ... GROSS! Ha ha....   Okay- place is divided, bar/ghetto club vibe with hip hop and redneck karaoke room. It's a little fun when they have their jazz jam nights on Tuesdays- some talented musicians come out, but it feels more like a practice session than entertainment, but still fun none the less. Good energy- nice change from the ghetto fabness the area has been sportin' recently... ... maybe historically. I dunno.

Old working man's bar. People are nice for the most part- bartenders are less skanky (some even nice) than the bars in the neighborhood with the same owner.   Nothing special about the place- just a neighborhood dive. Sometimes there are a lot of bikers- the neighborhood is going to hell. Shoot out just the other day- saw a man blocking traffic on Peoria right in front of the place, beating his passenger. The liquor store next door calls black people "animals". I could live the rest of my life happily without ever returning- yet, this is my hood, so whatevs- you know I'm coming back... ... ... ...  and he said, "Baby, anywhere you want... you want the Four Seasons?" and she said, " Four Seasons?... ~Skink-hock-ptui~ Nah, I wanna go to the 5030!".  True Story.

This is your regular North Side run down divey sports bar, except It smells weird and I always get severely congested in there.(I wonder if they have a mold problem.) It's a  really big place, there is a wall of TVs and it's usually pretty full. Also, they serve free hot wings during happy hour, so if you're into that...  I don't like it, because I don't like sports and I like background music when I'm drinking. Plus I've seen some obnoxious drunks in there and never anyone slightly hip, which is fine, but... well, it is what it is.  I would give 2 or 3 stars, but often the bartenders have attitude. No matter how friendly I am or how much I try to get on their good side with good tips, asking them how they are doing, etc. they still kind of act rude. There's one girl in particular, but I can't remember her name. She wears glasses, has dark hair and is pale. She will purposely ignore me and help all the men at the bar instead.   It may be a silly gripe, but that's  the reason I haven't gone back. I like friendly neighborhood places.

I trust this office for the most part. Which is saying a lot, because I have had some pretty shitty vets. Here's the good and the bad.  Good - Vet listens - Vet follows up and this means so much to me. I've never had a vet actually follow up to see if my pet was better. - Vet has actually recommended things that have helped my cat - Vet is competent - Many nurses are very sweet and seem to actually care   Bad - The wait.  You can make an appointment, show up on time and wait in the exam room for a half hour or so until the nurse arrives. This irritates me a lot, and has been my experience on most visits. - The prices are high, but if something were to go really wrong with my animals- these are the people I would go to.

Changed my mind after the last interaction. I returned a check-up call and spoke with the front desk woman- I can't remember her name. I think it is Laurie, but I'm not sure. Anyhow, her apathetic poor bedside manner turned me off. I will now be looking for a new vet.

I gave 2 stars, because the place itself is beautiful and 2 of the desk people that work here (the gentleman on the weekends) and the lady working my second visit here, were very nice and friendly.  I brought in a young cat that I adopted from the neighborhood. I asked that she be tested for FIV and Feline Leukemia and if she were clean be given the leukemia vaccine. I also mentioned that I heard her sneeze. While having a look at her they noticed ear mites and swabbed the ear- which showed all the gross brown stuff. They asked if I wanted that under a scope to be sure, but I didn't think it was necessary because it was pretty obvious what it was.  When they brought in my estimate of charges- I was surprised that they wanted me to do 4 other vaccines as well- at one time. I declined all but the Feline Leukemia one, and they charged me the same price as if I got the entire package. But, what really bothered me is that the scope of the mites was an additional $48. They mentioned it as is it were a courtesy. $48 to magnify little bugs? I am glad I declined.  Also, the vet  wasn't able to identify an approximate age on my cat that I brought in, but I could tell by a few remarks that they had suspicions she was full grown, for example, they asked if I had "seen her grow"'. However, they still pushed the "kitten package" my first visit here. They also wanted me to buy these ear drops for the mites, which they charged $77 for.The same ear drops can be found online in numerous places for $12.99 to $35. I was not going to pay that much, so they recommended an injectable drug for an additional $30. I agreed to that.  So, I paid $162.23 for a visit- $48 for the visit, $60 for the FelV and FIV bloood test, $24 for the Felv vaccine, $30 for the Ivomec. (Which did not get rid of the mites btw).  A couple days later my cat became very sneezy, congested and sick. I brought her back, because due to the holiday, my regular vet was still closed. Again, they recommended 2 more vaccines and they charged me $56 for an antibiotic injection, which I have paid for the same injection at numerous vets in the area and they are normally $30. That really bothered me. Somehow, this visit ended up being $120. YIKES!  I am not a cheap person. I just nursed a cat for 3 months through chemo treatments that were $200-$500 per week. So, I understand that some things are just expensive, but I do not like being taken advantage of.  Now, I have struggled with whether or not to mention this- but I will and you can form your own opinion. Each time the vet gave my cat an injection, the vet fisted the syringe covering the entire syringe, so I couldn't see what was in it. The first time I noticed him do that, I felt uncomfortable about it, something seemed off- it was an odd way to hold a syringe- but I brushed it off, but then he did it the second visit as well, and given my cat's lack of recovery... Why would someone hold a syringe like that?  I have a lot of experience seeing cats get injections due to treating my old kitty when she had cancer. I have never seen someone give an injection that way...   My cat ended up getting a lot sicker after the second visit. Her eye was watering and she was snorting because she was so congested she couldn't breathe through her nose. So, I took her to my regular vet, and she recovered very quickly.  Anyhow, long story short- I will not go back to Ambassador. They are too expensive. They try to upsell way too much at a time, I feel distrustful due to them covering the syringe completely so you can not see what is inside. The 2 things I had them treat my cat for- did not get better (mites and respiratory). for these reasons- I would not recommend them.

I've had so many bad veterinarian experiences in the past that I tend to be apprehensive. Sunburst has turned my attitude around. Although their front desk manners lack warmth and friendliness most of the time- don't let their aloof impersonal attitudes scare you away. This place really will take good care of your pets and they will not charge you an arm and a leg.  The amount of care and attention they gave to a stray I brought in amazed me. For that, they have won me over.

I thought this place was absolutely great until today. In fact, I have referred so many people here.  However,  my cat is sick and they can't get me in until tomorrow. Which is fine and understandable, but I told them I would make the appointment, but will call around and see if someone can see my cat sooner, as last year my other cat died suddenly and I don't want to take any chances.   What I get from there is a lecture on how I should have made an appointment earlier... like it's my fault that they don't have any openings. The only reason I didn't make an appointment the day before is BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT OPEN ON SUNDAYS.   Just another place with terrible service and people with poor bedside manners manning the phone. Walmart has nicer employees. Now, I have to find someone to check my cat out, as I am very worried and will NEVER come to this place again.

I've come here twice. Both times the vet tried to up-sell lots of tests and prescription pills.   The first time I thought they really were recommending what is for the best- and I actually did get the Xrays that they advised, though I had them done at a different vet's office, because it was significantly less expensive. (Those xrays didn't explain any of the problems either). The 2nd time, when I brought a stray dog in that looked significantly underweight. The vet said  she could feel the dogs liver... and as she began to explain the next part she hid her hands in her pockets, a classic move made by a person when not being forthcoming, and said it could be a mass, but it could also be because the dog is skinny. She said the dog looked pretty good other than that and she'd write up a action plan for getting the dog back in good health. She then left and sent in a tech with a itemized bill for blood work and shots over $500 worth.   I then attempted to clarify what I came in for. I wanted to know the dogs health, if the dog appeared neglected or sick and what to do to help the dog gain the weight back. I wanted to know roughly how old the dog was, and what I could do to help the dog get healthy. I've never owned a dog before. I also said, I noticed the dog seemed stiff and I could hear her joints pop when she moved sometimes, and I would like information that could answer questions like, Should I give the dog glucocamine?". Is it an injury or just because of the age? The tech left to speak with the vet again, and then returned and said, the vet says the dog is about 5, though we can't really confirm that. Here is the Prescription she wrote up.   At this point, I was very aggravated. I exclaimed that I wanted information, dietary advice. My main concern was that the dog was underweight due to lack of food. I want to know things like what type of food is best to help the dog recover. I've NEVER even had a dog before, which I said when I made the appointment and stated several times throughout the appointment. The tech looked baffled, and I told her that I was not going to return to this clinic ever again. I went to pay and I told them that I felt swindled. I explained that I still didn't even have answers for simple questions on what type of food is best to feed an underweight dog, and I didn't understand why their office couldn't give basic care advice and instead just kept writing up quotes for tests and drugs.   At that point the tech came to the front and said she talked to the vet and the vet wanted me to have a handout about arthritis. I admit, I sarcastically thanked her for giving me information that I could have easily looked up myself online, and explained that now I still need to look up dietary information online and I think it's ridiculous that I should have to do that when I just paid $50 to talk to a veterinarian and have the dog examined.    I left promising to contact the Better Business Bureau. Which I probably will do.   I'm just at a point in my life where I'm sick of not getting what I pay for. Is anyone with me on this? It's like I can even by an f%#^$^% sweater that won't unravel in a month because everything is made in China by 5 year olds, I buy used cars around 60,000 miles, because new cars are put together so shoddy that used cars with that kind of mileage already have new transmissions and alternators and starters... The repairs are better quality than what you actually get when you buy the car, unless you get a mechanic that insists that you have replace a $500 part in order to fix a $200 part, when 3 other people gave you quotes that didn't include that repair- or an electrician that insists the lighting in your business needs to be replaced or the lights aren't going to turn on, but when they find out that there isn't anyway to authorize that type of repair a miracle from heaven unfolds and the lights magically work once again.   Here's the truth people. Everyone's out to get your hard earned money, and few ever offer quality service or merchandise in return.   This veterinarian could have given me some advice like, since she's under weight you might want to feed her a puppy kibble or some wet food, or increase the portion- and also it wouldn't be a bad idea to do some blood work to see her overall general health. I could respect that, but not offering any advice on the animal whatsoever except for the tests and drugs, seems a bit ridiculous. And if they can't tell me anything about the health of the animal without the tests, then someone explain to me WHY ON EARTH THEY ARE ALLOWED TO PRESCRIBE DRUGS? If you are that clueless as to the health of the animal without your $500 full work up, then how can you in confidence recommend $50 worth of prescription drugs?   The only redeeming quality that I have to mention about this place, is the techs are nice and friendly.

I love this place. Everytime I go I have so much fun that I'm in recovery for days after... which is why I limit my visits, but by far, this is my favorite bar and it's been a fave in Phoenix forever- even my mom and her friends, when they were much younger, hung out at Char's for some fun and dancing. Good R&B music, dancing and entertainment.

The green curry is not so good. It's very basic and just tastes like paste mixed with coconut. I prefer when there is fresh lemongrass and thai basil in it and some spice, heat and more seasoning.   However, I had this soup there. I'm not sure which one it is. It's closer to the bottom of the soup menu. It's served in one of the metal bowl things with the flame under it. It is red and has lots of lemon grass stalks in it and what looks like it might be galangal(?)  woody looking chips, chicken (I don't even like chicken) and spicy deliciousness (that's an ingredient now). This soup is killer. I think about it all the time. If I could marry it, I might. It's only $8 as well and enough for two people to share, and I would go as far as to say that it would fill you up at lunch time.  Go there, try this soup.   Other than that.... um the place isn't very nice but it's not bad either, just a casual small little restaurant. The service is good- nothing else is very memorable about it for me except that soup, Good stuff.

These guys seemed very nice, and they came out and gave me a quote for stump grinding. I had 2 trees that I hadn't cut down yet, but was planning to upon receiving the quote for the stump grinding. I needed to make sure I could afford it. I received a very reasonable quote from Harris and Sons and went ahead and cut the trees down and called them back to schedule a time for them to grind the stumps a few days later. I spoke directly with one of the guys and he said they would check their schedule for the following week and call me back. No one called me back. I called again and this time I left a message with their answering service. No one called me back.  So, I guess I need to find a new company to do the work. Unfortunately, I budgeted for the quote Harris and Sons provided and I am finding that the work is much more expensive. I wish I wouldn't have cut my trees down- I could have waited until next year, but I knew the trees were declining and since Harris and Sons provided a reasonable quote I thought I should get it taken care of now.   I give Harris and Sons one star, because while I appreciate them coming out and giving me a quote in a timely manner, not returning calls or honoring the quotes- is really crappy. I am feeling pretty sad looking at my barren front yard with big tree stumps sticking out like eye sores.

It's hard to find a good vet now days- one that shows compassion, one that follows up, one that is thorough in communication.  My family has been taking their cats here since I was a preteen- back when Krista (I think that's her name) was running the place. So, when I moved back to Arizona this is the first vet I decided to take my cat to see.  My cat has IBS and has for years and lately her symptoms have worsened and have been causing her severe pain. The new vet at Larkspur cat clinic saw my cat and he recommended two medications to ease her pain and inflammation.  Now, when he gave me these medications he didn't mention any cautions or side effects. Didn't say to watch out for anything in particular- he just told me that they would help relax and ease the pain. So, I went home and I gave these medications to my cat. Within a couple hours she looked drugged up and out of it. She was acting quite strange and after 2 days she was very constipated and straining to the point that she was crying in pain.   I decided to look up the medications prescribed and every single website I went to (and I went to a bunch) said that both medications are used in dogs- one of the dog medications was commonly administered to dogs in 17-23mg dosages- which my cat's dosage was 43mg (seems a bit high for a 6 pound feline), and the other medication had repeated warnings that it was controversial for cats and I read several times that is should NEVER be used on cats because it can cause constipation and blockages that can lead to disease and death, or something to that effect.  At this point I called the clinic and I explained my cats odd behavior and the constipation and straining. I also mentioned the medication and told them that I understand if there was a reason that the cat was given this type of medication, but was concerned because I read that there were side effects associated with this drug in cats and my cat was straining a lot and seemed out of it.   The woman told me the doctor was busy and couldn't take my call. So, I asked if he could please call me back before 4PM that day because I was very concerned about my cat (it was 9 AM when I called), . The woman literally... LITERALLY, snickered out loud, condescendingly, and snorted that the doctor was very busy and she'll 'see'... ~click~  Anyhow, the vet NEVER called. Surprise!  I have found a new vet- that so far has been very good to my cat. They follow up and check in and make sure my cat's symptoms aren't getting worse. I showed the new vet and the nurses the medication that I was given to administer to my cat. They were all shocked. First, one of the medications are these huge capsules- they are people sized. The first comment I heard was, "I've never seen medication in that format... for a cat". The other medication I was given were broken pills. Again- everyone was shocked by the format of the medication alone.  The new vet said she was unfamiliar with using the 2 medications on cats. I could tell she didn't want to say anything negative, so instead she told me to give  her a couple days to research the drugs and she'd let me know whether or not it was safe to give to my cat.  A day and a half later I get a call from her. She says one of the meds is probably ok, but if the cat hasn't gotten better from it- don't give it to her. The other one- she said she didn't feel comfortable with me giving it to the cat and asked me not to.   I will NEVER go back to Larkspur Cat Clinic. From giving me dangerous drugs (it seems like they buy what's on sale and give it out generically even if it's canine medication) that could kill my cat, no warning to the many possible side effects and complications to the dangerous dog medicine prescribed for my cat, then the horrific service- (Who condescendingly laughs at you when you are calling to say that your cat is having a bad reaction to the medication your doctor recently prescribed?) and then the fact that they NEVER called back- not to return my call, not to follow up, not to give further direction. I can't believe I paid $100 for this! They charged me almost $40 for the bad meds as well.   I'm actually filing a complaint with the state board, and I told my family about what happened and we are all switching vets. I don't know what happened to this place, but it's not what it used to be.

There are plenty of restaurants with great food or even better food for a fraction of the price. It's just ok... My shrimp on my salad were so overly salted that they cut my tongue. Scallops were great, steak good too... Just not worth the absurd prices.

It was my 30th birthday. I was feeling good- drove to AZ  with the top down. Got a killer suntan (which I never do), and wasn't hung over, a lovely habit of birthdays past to break. You see, I'm just too mature for all that now... not to mention wise. Yes, I officially became wise that morning. It was pretty rad.  So, anyway, I went out with my mom in Scottsdale, AZ to celebrate the big 3-0. She took me to the "hippest" place she knows of... a.k.a. the only place she knows of Eli's, or as I like to refer to it, 'Cougar Central'. It was a cute place in all, I mean it's frickin' huge compared to any place in LA. I could've played a round of golf in there, but it started to depress me a little. I was like, thanks Mom, is this what I have to look forward to? Will I one day have leathery skin and bad makeup to go along with my blond hair and fake boobs the size of watermelons, because I'm trying as hard as I can to detract from my withered face and still be sexy? What are you trying to tell me here woman? I know you birthed me and it was a painful experience and your vagina is probably still mad at me, but this is just cruel and unusual punishment.  But then, amidst the Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri fields a light appeared from heavens and the hottest Cougars I have ever seen in my entire life took seats at our table. Granted, they did have watermelon sized fake boobs, but despite that one faux pas (it is Scottsdale after all), they were 'classy' from head to toe; stylish, but not in a, "I bought this outfit at ForeverSlutty1 this morning" sort of way; well put together- no tacky bleached porn star hair- no bad make-up choices, just some hot to trot confident 50 year old women- and these women had some dance moves too! Thank goodness Eli's provides some live music... You'll be in heaven if all your favorite songs are from the 1994 top billboard chart... I kid, but not really. Anyhow, these Cougars sorta put me to shame on the dance floor.  So, on with it, I watched as  gross middleaged out of shape men, one after another, pursued these hotties with passion in their eyes, and these bitches be like, "NEXT." It was rad! So, the moral is: there isn't a fucking moral, but this was my experience at Eli's and Cougars are A-OK.

I went here for a date and I really liked the place.  The patio is very nice. I like the overall atmosphere as well. It's not your typical chain style restaurant. I think it may actually be in an old Craftsman house.   Anyhow, the pizza is decent. It's not the best I've ever had, but I like it. The service was really good as well. Overall, I would come here again and I definitely recommend it for a date spot.. Especially when the weather is nice and you can take advantage of that glowing patio ambiance.  The only gripe would be that after a bottle of wine and splitting a pizza, we were asked twice if we wanted another pizza. Really? 2 pizzas in one night for 2 people? Granted they are not that big, but it's 4 pieces each.   I didn't comment on the absurdity of the suggested portions, but as we got the check the girl said something like, "guess we're eating light tonight". I really felt like saying- "no, we're not stuffing our faces tonight and instead eating appropriate portions. Though obesity is an epidemic there is an easy preventative measure that can be taken." But, I decided against being bitchy. Perhaps she can persuade other people to take the path of heart disease.

I wanted to like this place, but the food wasn't very good. Don't come here if you are a vegetarian.

I'm not really a fan of New Mexican cuisine... It tastes like food I used to eat at home growing up. So, I am not going to review the food.   I like that the people working here really believe in their product. It's a cool place to have a few drinks or a couple glasses of wine- I like small and quaint moody scenes... this fits the bill. The service is very good as well.

Hmmm, so the good... They serve booze, which is nice because when you're drunk your standards generally lower- just ask What's His Face or my dignity after last Saturday night. Anyhow, do we really need more than one of these abominations in the valley? I think a chain restaurant should only exist when the food is good enough to warrant more access to the greater population. This place does not qualify.   This is the type of place that inspires documentaries about the shocking cheesy grease stuffed pots of lard that Americans shovel in their bellies for breakfast. Deep fried appetizers, cheese on almost everything, and not just enough cheese to add flavor. It's more like a course of cheese with a side of chips.   They do have quote on quote healthy options, but they are boring as all hell. However, I've noticed a trend with AZ Mexican "healthy options". They don't know how to make anything healthy without just giving your some meat and vegetables. It's so boring. I wish more places would attempt to recreate dishes with healthy ingredients. It is possible to make healthy tacos among other things.   Anyway, my friend's plate looked like a cheesy greasy mess. As for mine, I wanted a little healthier meal. I ordered 1 spinach enchilada. I was happy with the fresh taste of the spinach, but disappointed that there wasn't any seasoning at all. It tasted like spinach with salt. It's suppose to be an enchilada for christ sake- some chili powder, maybe enchilada sauce... to contradict myself above, cheese would have greatly helped this item. I also ordered one pork taco, or what would normally be called Carnitas... damn gringo ass Peoria. Anyhow, once again, NO SEASONING! Look, I get than many people can't tolerate heat, but you can use spice and add flavor without adding heat. If you are giving me a taco use some fricking seasoning... This should be a given.  Now, a couple highlights: I liked the Skinny margarita. Though this was a "specialty" drink,  Margaritas are suppose to be made with Lime juice, not nasty ass margie mix- So, that's a good thing. The bad? Don't measure me half a jigger and charge me 9 bucks! I don't care what the law or code is, make me a drink that tastes good and gives me a little buzz.The other good thing- fresh guacamole... thank God for this. If it had been something nasty I would have had to smack the chef around a little. The last good thing, the fresh tortillas. Though they were a little thicker than I prefer and not traditional corn ones, they were quite lovely.

Good. Not authentic, but I think the name suggests it's just a "touch of Thai". I'd say more than a touch though. I really enjoy the yellow curry. The red was a bit too watery. The spicy eggplant had nice flavor. The shrimp did not taste fresh.  All in all, cute place. I would return.

I used to like this place a lot. I have noticed the food has gone down hill, but the worst thing is, the last 2 times I've been there... COCKROACHES! I feel bad writing such things, but come on! Get an exterminator! It's disgusting and disrespectful to your patrons to not do something about roaches.  Baby ones crawling up the walls too.... Icky!

Absolutely gross-  I'm just going to be bluntly honest- who the F cares what the food tastes like when the place looks like a frickin' dump?  It was so disgustingly dirty inside. Besides food, paper, trash- resting among the carpet- the tables were dirty, the bathroom was out of service and I feared touching anything as I was led to my seat... that's a problem.  I've actually never seen such a messy restaurant before. Let me also say that the restaurant was empty when we arrived, and was filthy when we walked in and was filthy when we left.   Obviously no one that works at this restaurant cares about cleaning up between seatings. There's no excuse for a place to be disgusting like this. It's downright unsanitary. You serve food Valle Luna, you're a business Valle Luna- keep the place clean for heaven's sake.

Dear Metrocenter,  It has come to my attention that your new gang name is Ghettocenter. I just want you to know that I really think Casper, Shilo, or Crazy Loc would've been a better choice, but still, hit me up when you get that tear drop tat on your cheek.. k?  JUST OPEN A WALMART AND BECOME CHRISTOWN ALREADY!  Peace.

Well, goodness- glad I never found any bugs in my food like these other reviews state. I find the service here to be excellent. The ladies are so nice and attentive. I really enjoyed some particular Korean greens and was not familiar with them- they wrote down the Korean name for them, told me where I could buy them and how to prepare them... pretty awesome!  I'll be honest, I don't love the sushi here, but the Korean dishes are very good. I used to live near Ktown in LA and have some experience with Korean food- I like the food here, it's good.  As for the Japanese dishes besides sushi that I have tried... they have been okay, but not my favorite.  I guess ultimately, I would give 3 starts for food- if they only served Korean food I would give 4 stars- However, since the service is always so friendly I think they deserve a solid 4 stars. Hospitality, smiling faces and politeness really add to and make an experience memorable. For that, they get my business... However, if I ever find a bug in my meal... everything will change!

I grew up hiking this mountain and my dad lived down the street. There are various trails, I have my favorite though. In the spring I go during the day and often see lots of gila monsters (at least I think that's what they are). In the summer I hike at night and it's so lovely and crisp in the winter. I really like this place. It's pretty, though it's a heck of a lot more crowded then it was 20 years ago.

I do not want to discourage people from adopting pets from the Humane Society, but I do want to encourage questions. Ask lots of questions please, and demand to read their records before making a decision.   I recently adopted a little cat from the Humane Society. I could tell she was scared, but she sat on my lap and let me pet her and even purred. The volunteer helping me told me they were euthanizing cats because there were too many of them and that this little kitty had been in custody since February and in a cage for 4 weeks. She went on about how depressed kitty was, and of course this tugged on my heart strings and all I wanted to do was save little kitty and give her tons of love and get her out of there before she was euthanized.  The flyer on her cage described her as "a little shy". Well, after I signed the papers and they boxed up kitty, they opened her records and did a skim read to me before handing them over. They mentioned that she was brought in with kittens and was fostered and had 2 colds, which they assured me she was treated and cured. I mentioned something about euthanasia and then they told me that wouldn't have happened to little kitty- only cats surrendered when they were to capacity were at risk. It bothered me that the stories weren't matching up, but I decided not to make a big deal about it.  I didn't read the records in detail  until I got home. I get home and let little kitty out and she's still scared, which is normal, but I'm petting her, she's purring and then all of the sudden she bites me- and draws blood. I'm a little shocked. I have adopted a couple cats from the shelter and I've never experienced this. Anyhow, I decide to read through her records and see that she attacked the staff and had to be put in 24 hour chill and she was noted as having behavioral issues- she was also netted twice. This was all in the paperwork that the worker was supposedly going over and explaining to me at the time of the adoption. Interesting that all of this was skipped- I think it's pretty important information, not just for the sake of letting a person know what they are getting into, but for safety reasons.  I just lost a cat, and perhaps it was too soon for me to adopt a new one, but I could have handled it. However,I wasn't prepared for this. I'm in such a stressful situation now. I have this wild kitty, that really is sweet, but needs someone more experienced with wild kitties to take care of her. I can't take her back to the Humane Society, because they are to capacity and I fear they will put the cat down since she bites- but I really don't want an unpredictable cat that bites. (She got me again last night and drew blood).  I'm so angry that this information was NOT disclosed and was INTENTIONALLY looked over. Someone might have adopted this cat knowing the truth, someone that has more experience with shy little wild kitties. But it's wrong to withhold important information like this, and I now feel incredibly burdened by this cat. I'm just about in tears daily over it- because I feel guilty that I lack the understanding a cat like this needs, and I don't know what to do, because I think she would make a fine pet for someone with experience.  In addition, to all this- the cat was in fact still sick and ended up giving the illness to my other cat. This cost me over a $100 and my other cat has a condition already, so this was scary for me.  So... what do I do now? I'm afraid to give the cat to just anybody, as I fear the first time she bites they'll get rid of her, but I really don't want her because I'm not good with this type of cat personality and I don't want a cat with this type of personality.  I'm just pissed off that this is now MY burden because of the dishonesty of the Humane Society. It really sucks.  As a disclaimer, she is a really cute little cat and she does like pets and has chilled out quite a bit- but still... not what I signed up for.

This place is okay. The only reason I would ever go here is because my boyfriend sometimes wants sushi and it's near his house... I personally don't like it all that much. It's just mediocre sushi. As for the ambiance, I don't mind hole in the wall type spots, but I just don't really like this place, the service is kind of crap as well.

When I left L.A. and landed in suburban sprawl I thought my days of combing the aisles in the Asian Markets were kaput. Thank heavens I founds Lee Lee's.   This is a fantastic Asian Market. It's gigantic... bigger than say, a Fry's. Which is very nice because stank fish smell does't permeate the air like it can in some small Asian Markets.   The selection is great. I think it is very clever and helpful that they have labeled many aisles "Korean", " Japanese", "Indian" - it certainly makes spice hunting easier. The prices are pretty low for Arizona, but higher than Asian markets in L.A.. For example, 3 or 4 stalks of lemon grass would be $2 and some change, where in L.A. it would be 99 cents. But, hey I can buy fresh lemongrass... score!  The only gripes I have...   - The herbs come in huge packages. I do not need a pound of Thai basil. However, they have made me smaller packages when I have asked.   - Their rice is expensive considering it is a staple ingredient. It's actually often cheaper to buy brown rice in bulk at Wholepaychecks... ahem.... I mean Foods... which is sayin' something, but whatevs.   Lee Lee Market is awesome.

I ate here today. I ordered a "Mediterranean" wrap. It was okay, except for the fact that I had to send it back and have it remade due to the 3 curly brown hairs adorning it as a garnish. That was pretty sick, but the staff was really nice and I liked the fact that they had low calorie options. All in all, it is a commercial space, nothing unique, but a decent place for a casual lunch.

I was torn between a 1 star and a 2 star, but I decided on 2 stars because the complimentary bread and pesto they bring you while you wait for you food is pretty good. In fact, it was the best thing I had.   I ordered the stuffed mushrooms, and the stuffing was repulsive. It was dark black  and resembled mushed up soggy bread. I had to ask what it was, because besides tasting like bland mushy yeasty dough- it looked disgusting. They assured me it was mushrooms and bread crumbs cooked in white wine with seasoning- it may have been mushrooms and left-over stale bread, but I am certain there wasn't any seasoning- not even salt. Not good. I removed the stuffing and just ate the mushroom in the rich, cheesy orange sauce the shrooms were drown in. The sauce was tasty, but it's hard to make cream and melted cheese taste bad.  I actually make some pretty killer stuffed mushrooms at home- I would not serve Il Posto's  in my  kitchen- they were just bad.  I also had a simple dinner salad. It had canned olives, processed, maybe pre-shredded mozzarella- it came with a pre-made dressing. When they said, "raspberry vinaigrette"- I was not expecting a creamy pink pepto-bismol looking dressing. So weird...  Maybe I am just too much of a foodie... sheesh. I rarely eat canned olives, processed cheese and I make all of my salad dressings... it's pretty easy to make a vinegarette- there's usually only 2 main ingredients.   My wine was also not very good.  My server was nice, the hostess was nice, the manager was nice- I will say that although my server was nice- she presented herself very ditsy. I asked what was good on the menu and mentioned that I am vegetarian, but on occasion eat seafood- she was not able to recommend anything- she said, "It depends on what you like... tee hee tee hee hee". She sort of spoke in a baby talk way and giggled quite a bit- she also kept calling me "Doll", which was annoying. I think I caught her about to twirl her hair at one point. All the servers looked very young- almost like a harem of female teens. It is an interesting dynamic. I would not be surprised to find out the hiring manager is a man in his 20s to early 30s. Anyhow, they were nice- it's just the ditsy act is off-putting, unprofessional.  All in all- I have always wanted to try this place as I hike in the area often and have tried all the other restaurants around. The patio looked pretty cool- if cactus weren't wilting outside at dusk (summers in Phoenix- ugh). I will not be back though- The tacos next door are about 75% less expensive and 200% better tasting.

This place is very far away from me, but it's a great nursery. Their plants appear incredibly healthy, and the staff is knowledgeable and helpful. I actually learned a lot on my visit and they gave me tips for maintaining my existing fruit trees.  On another note, I was a little bothered by a Latino family saying rude things about me and my whiteness in Spanish when I walked in. That's not Elgin's fault, but it made me feel a little uncomfortable. Luckily I decided to ignore the racists. I'm glad I did, because this is now one of my favorite nurseries in the valley.

You know, I love this place. Some stuff is a little pricey, but for veggie transplants, flowers, etc. They are great and the service is awesome. You can tell these guys  are passionate about what they do. Also, I like the selection. I always see plants that are new to me here. It's worth the drive. Did I mention their large trees are quite reasonable as well and they have a nice selection of desert plants.

I had a casual dinner date here, and I really liked the place. The food was fresh and flavorful. The green juices were good. As a "clean" eater, I would definitely come back if I was in the neighborhood, though I wouldn't make it a destination.  If you are vegan, vegetarian or just into healthy fresh food, then you will be into this place. It's not a vegetarian restaurant though, so even people on traditional American diets would enjoy it as well. (Don't be discouraged and think this is a rabbit food hub, k?)  I feel like for me, this is more of a lunch spot or casual dinner. The seating doesn't feel very intimate, but I'm really an ambiance nut.   Definitely worth checking out.

I came in here for a quick bite the other day. The food is good, but the prices are just too ridiculous. A cup of vegan lentil soup is $7. That's just crazy. The entire bowl probably cost a little bit of change to make, and the bowl size was small and not even filled completely. As much as I like the food, and even though I have the money, I just can't justify spending $7 on a small portion of lentil soup. It didn't even come with a piece of bread or some other like carb. I finished it in less than 5 minutes.  Whatevs.  I could understand if it was mind blowing food, but I can cook food that is comparable.

I used to like this place, but it kind of lost its zest. Popped in and immediately the bartender greeted me, but it was a weird greeting along the lines of,"why are you here?". The menu really doesn't have many options if you want to eat light, and half the staff was just hanging out at the bar, nothing makes me want to spend $24 on 2 drinks less than more employees at the bar then customers. Guess I fell out of like.

How disappointing... I really wanted a yogurt- I wanted to sample some of the flavors, but they won't let you make your own sample. Instead they have a teenage girl on the floor holding sample cups and rubbing her bare fingers all over the inside and outside of them. It's incredibly unhygienic and disgusting. I asked her for a couple of sample cups, so I could try a couple flavors. I really asked for a couple, because I did not want the top cup that she kept rubbing her fingers in. She told me I wasn't allowed to make my own sample though.   I don't feel comfortable eating yogurt directly from a sample cup that a teenager was rubbing her fingers all over the inside and outside of- all because they don't trust their customers... No thanks. I'll go to a different yogurt shop. That's gross.

Often I don't write a review for a place that has so many reviews. What's mine matter right? But, I went here a couple months ago and this place left a lasting impression.   You see I love salad and all, but typically refuse to order it at a restaurant, unless it's a side, but the Mixed Greens salad is so delicious. It's perfectly balanced. In fact, it's so good I duplicated it at home, because I loved it so much.   The bartenders were really sweet and really cute, and the service in general was awesomeness starting with the hostess on down. I also tried a sandwich and had a nice piece of cheese with some honey for dessert.  Everything was great and it made it worth the wait, because you will have to wait for a seat most likely.

I was so thrilled when the BF took me here for breakfast today. It is so rare that we get to enjoy a morning together with our hectic lives. The menu looked delicious- and the Eggs Benedict special that my BF ordered was great. In no way, would I consider it "healthy" though... lol! Loaded in delicious fat... The employees were polite as well- even though the place was packed.  I ordered the kale salad... This is where things went very down hill... it was covered in oil. No dressing, but olive oil. There was so much oil on the salad that it pooled on the plate. I rarely send anything back, but it was inedible.   They took it back and brought me out a new plate that almost looked like the same exact salad...  I ate about half of the salad- again oil pooled on the plate, but my mouth was so coated with olive oil, I was starting to feel sick. I could feel it on my lips, my chin... absolutely DISGUSTING!  Since this is what they gave us after I already sent it back for too much oil... I didn't want to complain again. I really dislike having to do that, especially since the place was very busy.  I ended up using about 27 napkins... I am NOT exaggerating.  I used about 27 napkins to ring out the kale, so that the dish would be edible. We had a huge pile of oil soaked napkins all over our table. My hands were also soaked with oil... It was ridiculous. Even the people sitting at the table next to us were shocked by the amount of oil... it was really awful. Even after using 27 napkins to soak up some of the oil... the rest was still very oily... it was just a little more tolerable. Although the employees were very polite here, they did see what was happening with the salad, but never offered to fix the plate again- and made sure not to ask how our meal was when we purchased a few miscellaneous items before departing.   We spent about $50-60 there this morning, between food and trinkets... I'm really disappointed that such a highly regarded establishment messed up so epic on something as simple as a salad.  Additionally, I ordered that salad as I have been trying to eat healthier, but since there was definitely more than 4 tablespoons of olive oil on the salad... that salad ended up being over 600 calories... which is such a bummer.  For that amount of calories and fat, I would have rather had the eggs benedict or something a heck of a lot tastier than a kale salad. I should have just not eaten it, but I wanted to enjoy the rare breakfast out with the BF.   I don't think we will come here again because of this experience.

This place is pretty good. It's among my favorites on this side of town. I have had really good sushi in my lifetime as I used to live in California, but this place is not bad.   I liked everything we ordered and the service was okay. I would come here again.

It's a trendy sushi bar, but the food is good. I have eaten here many times and have never felt disappointed.  However, the sushi bar area is uncomfortable. We were seated at the low spot of the sushi bar my last visit, and the counter sat right at chest level. It was nearly impossible to comfortably eat that way. We moved to another area of the sushi bar at regular height- it was much better, but the chairs are heavy and made of metal- it was very hard scooting in and out- also the curve a little on the edges like a bowl- I was wearing a dress and it was challenging getting out of my seat and still staying lady-like.   The look of the place is cool, but those chairs are not functional- nor is that short spot at the bar- terrible idea.  Eat at a table and you will be ok.

I love this place. I think the pizza is stellar. The salads are great too (though I like Postino's better for salad). The fresh house made pasta is good as well. I will say, sometimes I find the flavor combinations a little too rich. Though I'm not complaining- I just have to be in the mood for it.  Also, I feel like for a vegetarian- their pizza options are good, but not that exciting. They have a Margerhita- which I like, but many people find that a little too boring same with the pesto. They also have a Funghi, my favorite... and I think that might be it for vegetarian pizza options.   I usually order the Funghi. I like it a lot, though I went last Monday and they were very stingy with the Goat Cheese, which was a shame, because you need that tart goat cheese flavor to brighten up the richness of the truffle oil. Without enough it becomes a bit too musky. I also asked them to add arugula to it to help brighten it up. The arugula makes it much better, but still it needed more of the goat cheese. Don't get me wrong- I'm not the type that wants topping piled high- I appreciate restraint, but there just wasn't enough.   I wish they had something with a little more veg on it- like juicy sweet roasted cherry tomatoes with artichoke hearts and feta or kalmata olives with I dunno maybe kale, tomatoes and burrata...  Just a little more balanced- rich creamy, sweet, salty and fresh- gotta have some sort of green or herbaceous freshness. Yes, pesto has a green element, but pesto is more rich and pungent, not as fresh... I like fresh cutting herbaceous notes in rich food. I'm not a pizza chef though, so what do I know, but I make some killer vegetarian foods and am a gardener- so I tend to experiment a lot with this stuff. It could be my wonky taste buds...   I suppose I am just happy that there are vegetarian options at Parlor rather than salad... That seems to be my experience more often than not in Phoenix... "Sure, we have something vegetarian- try this salad." Thanks jerks! No, but thank you Parlor for having vegetarian options- I apologize for my uneasy to please critiques. It's me, not you.  As I write this, I wonder if Parlor is as good as I initially said it was... ,.. ... No worries, yes, it is as good. The selections with meat are killer and unique and the crust is delicious- which to me is the foundation of a good pizza- good crust, good cheese.  It's like with song writing- forget the bells and whistles or auto-tune and beat track, if you can't make it rock with an acoustic guitar and a decent set of pipes- it's probably not that great of a song.  Anyway... It's a nice place. Maybe a little pretentious for the dude that eats Tocci's Brooklyn Style on Friday nights... ahem... I'm not talking about my boyfriend or anything. But, definitely a spot worth checking out.

Exactly what a hole in the wall Pho place should be like! Totally reminds me of LA, SF or any authentic Pho place in any multi-cultural city. Congrats Phoenix for not being completely white bred and redneck- must give thanks to center city.  Anyhow, portions are large, ingredients taste fresh and prices are inexpensive. If you're one of the sheltered folk out here that gets freaked out by rude bums or the lack of decor- stay in the shelter of your HOA tract home or go to the mall.

I have no idea how this place has skated by with 4 stars. It's not like me to be scathing, but I'm about to scathe away. If I could, I would give ZERO stars... 1 star is sheer generosity,  Let's begin with, the place was dead so there is absolutely no excuse...     We ordered a cucumber salad and a beer along with 2 entrees.    -I ordered a Singha from the menu, but as it turns out- they only carried one brand of the extensive imported beer list... Ok, so I'll have the Lao beer...  -I had to wait for my beer, until they brought out the cucumber salad. Ok... I will wait for my drink to be brought out with the appetizer...  -Cucumber salad is literally about 8 cucumber chunks floating with serrano chilis and red onion in 3 inches of some kind of clear gel... I've never seen a cucumber salad in a bowl of tangy gel... it grossed me out immediately... but I digress. I didn't eat that.  -Our entrees come out. We are brought white rice rather than the brown rice we ordered.   -The pad thai with vegetables that we ordered comes out with only noodles... Apparently, the restaurant RAN OUT OF VEGETABLES. How does that happen in an Asian restaurant?   -Both the pad thai noodles with not as much as some green onion- just sauced noodles and yellow curry are completely mild- we ordered them hot. We also asked for extra chili sauce when we placed out order... of course that didn't happen.   -We weren't even provided with plates or serving spoons. We literally had to pick up the bowl and pour the curry onto our plates.  - As for utensils, we were only given forks, no knifes, spoons, nothing...   -Finally, they did bring some brown rice out and it was an instant microwaved brown rice... GROSS.  This place is TERRIBLE!!! Go to Siam on Northern. The only reason we weren't at Siam is because they are closed on Mondays.  Tonight was our meatless Monday- what a disappointing experience. We will never come back!

Last night was my first experience at 5th and Wine and my last. The service was unforgivable.   Firstly, no one came to bring us water, greet us, check on us, for quite awhile after we were seated. Finally, one of the staff members who was getting something at the wait station noticed us and asked if anyone had been with us. When we said no, all of the sudden a waiter jumps up from the table directly behind us where he was sitting and socializing  with friends and starts apologizing profusely... Apparently, he was too busy hanging out that he didn't notice us sitting there waiting right next to his table...   Our waiter the entire evening was distracted and rushed. We felt like we were putting him out, asking questions about the menu. My friend ordered the Red Sangria and he brought her white- and was no where to be found for such a long time, that we were unable to get it fixed. So, she went ahead and drank it. When he did come back, we brought it to his attention, which he was not apologetic at all and charged us for it. She ordered another one- the second time it was right.  I ordered the halibut, which the flavor was fantastic- loved the fennel and the sauce, but the fish was very over cooked and dry. I had only taken about 2 bites and the plate was mainly full- like 90% (the portion was on the small side), when our server approached and asked how our meal was. I told him that my fish was very overcooked (which my friend tasted and concurred). I praised the flavors of the dish, but expressed my disappointment that the star of the meal was not good.  He basically was like, and this is not verbatim, "Oh bummer... it's a shame when the best part isn't right". Then he just walked off. He didn't offer to have it remade- nothing. At the end of the evening, he took off one glass of wine (the least expensive that we ordered- as we ordered a couple different glasses). He said he was doing this as a favor because of my overcooked fish. So, I guess a comped $9 glass of wine makes up for an overcooked $28 entree...  I feel that our server was not concerned with getting our orders right, fixing mistakes- some directly linked to his performance as well, and was more concerned with his tip potentially going down then ensuring that his customers had a pleasant experience. Also, he was much more attentive to a larger table- and we felt he was "cherry picking" customers.   I spent about $115 all together for 2 people- that's with my generous $9 comp.  I left a $7 tip on my credit card and paid the remainder of the servers tip in cash, which was about 18%- far less than I would have left, had I received good service and far more than my server deserved. (Just an FYI to management, in case our waiter didn't claim the cash).   At the end of the day, the money was not the issue for me. Value is what is important- and don't feel that this meal was worth the cost.

My first experience was very positive so I started going back, but the last experience... The doctor made a brash diagnosis, prescribed  a handful of drugs without evidence to support the condition. I was never notified of any of my test results. When I called and asked if they could at least tell me the outcome of the xray that I took a week prior, they told me I should call the imaging center and get the xrays myself. They said they would have the doctor call me- he never did. Again, I called and told them that none of the medicine helped me- they said the doctor would call me again. He never did.   I will NEVER return to this place. I'm having difficulty breathing- I still don't know what is wrong and they don't even show the professionalism of following up on test results or returning calls. I'm incredibly disappointed, angry, sick... I'm not sure how to find a good doctor that cares about patients rather than drug pushing- Serious, when I leave a place with 5 different drugs for a cough with all normal test results- I feel like I just visited a drug dealer, not a doctor. My body is not a science experiment- it's not about feeding me pills and keeping your fingers crossed.

Honestly, I fricking love this place! The food is delicious. The only time I have ever disliked something here was when I ordered the Thom Yum vegetarian, but other than that.... LOVE the Thom Yum and the Thom Ka- great with chicken (and I hate chicken), really good with shrimp. The last time I ate here the shrimp seemed to be a lot better quality than a few years ago- so I'm pretty stoked for that, because a lot of places have really gross shrimp in Phoenix... you know that mushy shrimp that just seems icky... icky... right? That describes it? Icky shrimp. The shrimp they served me last time were plump and juicy and really good.  The fried rice dishes, excellent. The curries... pretty darn good. Pad Thai... yum... Cashew dishes, basil dishes... all GOOD. We always order extra veggies on just about everything and they always happily accommodate us with excellent fresh, perfectly al dente.  The area where you can find this awesome Thai restaurant may be described as pretty much, super ghetto- and beware, one day the guy that owns the liquor store next door came out and picked a fight with us for parking in front of his store, when he was closed for the day... That dudes a dick.  But, really, if you are on the West Side- this is definitely a good spot. I used to think Thai Rama was the stuff, but I think I prefer Siam now... Sorry Thai Rama.  My one gripe. Every single time I eat here, I ask for extra chili paste because my guy can't handle as much heat as me, so we end up ordering everything medium for his Caucasian palate- every single time they forget to bring the chili paste. But, what are you going to do? They will eventually bring it, we just have to ask again. My boyfriend said he figured out the secret- you have to ask for the chili paste when they bring your food out, or they will always forget.  One more thing, did I mention the servers are really nice, big smiles, very friendly... - 5 stars earned!

Such a shame. This is the exact kind of restaurant Im always looking for. Too bad the staff are oblivious to basic customer service. I've never been in, so i asked if I seat myself or wait to be seated. This question really threw the waiter for a loop. He just didn't know how to answer. Because I was carrying my laptop bag- he was more concerned on whether or not a was giving a lecture or something. Very strange... Then I had a seat, but no one came to my table to take my order. So, I notice the "order here" sign. I got up and asked, "is this where I order?". They responded, "wherever....".    It was like pulling teeth to figure out whether I seat myself or wait to be seated, whether a server takes my order or I order at the counter. It shouldn't be so hard to spend $20+ on a lunch and drink. Long story short- I just can't support a company with staff that are that confused and oblivious as to the basic functions of their job or just basic guest service.  I've never seen a place with such confused employees. I mean, who can't say whether its seat yourself or not? Who can't say whether a server will take your order or whether you order at the counter?   Ridiculous.

This is a little hole in the wall take out joint. You could eat in, if you want, but there is little ambiance and only 4 tables.   I'm incredibly particular and after walking into another Chinese restaurant down the street that was dirty and super stinky, I was scrutinizing this place. It's clean, in fact, it's super clean- at least on the surface. I did smell some backed up drain or something, but ... well, semantics I tell you.  I ordered the garlic shrimp combo. Oh my goodness. It was really good.I actually don't even like Chinese food all that much, but I thoroughly enjoyed it all. I'm really happy I popped in.  Plus the family running the place was very nice. They're children ran the cash register, while mom and pop cooked the food... They're living the American dream. That's what it's about. I will visit again.

The food is very good here-  and they gave some nice wines on the menu as well. Its a lovely atmosphere, but it's hard to get a seat at the bar whenever I'm in the area, so I don't get to enjoy it often.

The place itself is really cute and the ambiance is just right- however, the wine is questionable and the food is not great. I explained that I am primarily vegetarian, although I eat some fish on occasion. They recommended a salad on the menu and when I got it, it had bacon- that was not cool. I could not stand to see the pigs body thrown in the trash, so I ate it- but it was not good and I did not feel good afterwards.

This place is a bit stuffy. It's nice and all, but let me put it this way- this place is very age specific (like most of Scottsdale I suppose). You will have a lot of people in their late forties and up here- not that there's anything wrong with that.  I like some of the food,especially the tuna tartare, but they do some sort of sushi-American fusion roll that really sucks. I complain because it is one of the most expensive small plates on the menu and the number one thing the bartenders recommend (more on the bartenders... ahem...  'recommendations' later). So this roll consists mainly of lobster and high quality beef but then they go and ruin it by smothering the 2 indulgent ingredients in a sauce that overwhelms the entire plate, and the sushi rice is gross and kind of mealy.   That roll pisses me off. It needs editing, but I guess it reminds me of some of the unedited clientele I see at Eddie V's as well- like the bleached platinum blond girl with a hair piece, fake eyelashes, dark navy eye shadow, oompa loompa tan, injected lips, caked on makeup, fake boobs, fake claws, wearing a skin tight designer t-shirt along with a thousand dollar handbag and $400  jeans to coordinate with her stripper shoes and abundantly accessorized sterling silver Tiffany's jewelry that sat by me last visit. I mean each element of her style probably works on its own, but all together it looks like a Vogue magazine threw up on her. That's sort of what the roll was for me. (BTW, she ordered the same thing- the roll- and liked it, so what's that tell you?)  Now, for my big gripe. I can describe the type of wine I like quite well. I will ask for something that tastes a certain way and immediately every bartender- no matter what description I give- will direct me to the 2 most expensive wines by the glass (around $25 a glass) on the menu. Price does not equal quality and I find it offensive when I taste the $25 glass of  wine and it in no way mirrors what I was asking for. I feel like they are just trying to up-sell me without considering my taste. I get it. I work in sales too, but I think it's more important to give the customer what they want rather than try to push them into spending more money. Also, if I don't choose the most expensive wines, they kind of shrug their shoulders as if implying that all the other wines on the menu suck. I'm of the thinking that nothing on the menu should suck or not be worth suggesting in one way or another, so for that they get 2 stars. I have a feeling it's the staff more than the menu that is the problem.

Not much has changed. I asked for a wine recommendation. The first recommendation was the most expensive white by glass on the menu at $18, the second recommendation was the 2nd most expensive wine by glass on the menu at $16 and the 3rd wine recommendation they gave was a "discontinued" wine, not on the menu, but higher priced then all the other wines besides the first 2 they recommended on the menu at $15 a glass. I tried the most expensive, because I have the money- it wasn't worth it though. I've had far superior wines at a number of paces for far less.   What I dislike the most about this place is first, the bartenders will always recommend the most expensive wine on the menu, 2nd I was shocked that the staff (more than one of them) actually asked me what I did for a living without having any other sort of casual conversation... yes, I'm a decent looking lady that looks young for my age and I can afford your ridiculous recommendations... none of your business what I do. How rude. Of course, I tried to explain, but it was over their heads.   Anyhow, a 56 year old man sat beside me and at one point navigated my hand to feel his biceps and pecks... it was actually impressive, but um... yeah- no comment.

Although it is the most expensive pho place I have been- it's really good. The broth has so much flavor. I'm not crazy about the meat, but I really enjoyed the shrimp pho. The service is also very good- and the ambiance works too.   It's very small and cozy- I would probably avoid the place if it were packed, but it never has been when I have visited.  Also, if you can't find a parking spot- they have additionally parking in a parking lot a couple buildings north of the restaurant.

The bartender made us drinks after we said we didn't want more. Then he was like, just have them. Then he charged us. The place was empty. The live music was a dated blues band. They were talented musicians, but it was a boring show. The drinks weren't good at all and the also weren't inexpensive. I haven't any reason to return.

This place was pretty good. I didn't try the pizza, though it looked delicious, but since it's hard to mess up anything with burrata and I wanted something fresh- I went with the caprese.   The pesto was great, the burrata was of course really good as well and I liked the sour ciabatta it was served with. My only gripe was that it was hard to eat. I prefer fresh tomatoes, sliced. I found it a little difficult to get the delicious fresh taste of the ingredients in every bite with the roasted cherry tomatoes. I also just like the fresh flavor or raw tomato with the richness of the burrata and olive oil, and I guess the balsamic could be toned down.  However,  with all my gripes (everyone's a critic, right?), it was still very tasty, and the wine was decent and reasonably priced. I will return.

I like this shop because they carry raw cat and dog food and I think the price is a little more reasonable than what I've seen at other specialty shops. Also, the staff is really friendly and helpful.

I remember this place when it was Casey Jones. It was shitty then. I came here a few months ago for a drink at night and found that the place was your typical North Phoenix sports bar, except clean and not divey. For me, it was really boring and I didn't love it.   However, I came here for lunch and beer with a friend the other day and was actually very surprised. I had no idea they served good food. They make almost everything in house, the ingredients are fresh and the sandwiches are really damn tasty. Decent quality bread as well.   My only gripe is that the balsamic vinaigrette tastes like straight balsamic and the side salad is really not good. It's not 1984- good things have happened since iceberg lettuce. I wonder what the deal is with that-  the bartender even warned me that it was bad, but I thought how can one mess up a balsamic vinaigrette? Equal parts EVOO and Balsamic vinegar  a little dijon, a little honey... deliciousness. Apparently, it can be messed up.  I am fixated on this, because the bartender insisted it was made with oil and it was in fact a salad dressing not straight BV... but it really tasted like it was straight BV. So, ok- it sucks then, but the sandwiches are really good and I will eat there again some time.  I give it 4 stars, because there are few places in the area that actually serve fresh food.

I'm really happy I found this place. It's tucked away in a strip mall slightly off the main road. The interior is casual kinda cute and homey. The food is great!  The pastries are delicious, the chocolates are hand made. They have some unique creations as well, like Jujube tea for example.   It's a locally-owned shop, and the owners are nice, down-to-earth and talented. They also source some of their ingredients locally, which is always a great way to support our community!  If you are particular about your pastries, come here and you will not be disappointed. The coffee is good too. Really, this place is so much better than the Starbudgets down the street. I'm so thrilled to see a quality establishment open in the area. I hope a trend begins.

I've been coming in periodically since it opened. My boyfriend and I love this place. It's very affordable- okay wine and cocktails. Fun atmosphere- really tasty Asian Fusion with super tasty vegetarian options.   Everything I have ever ordered tastes great. My only gripe, I wish they served brown rice- white rice is just straight starch without any nutritional value and I don't like eating it.

I am all about supporting local business. So, I popped into this place for a trim. Upon entering the salon, I was hit by the overwhelming scent of synthetic air fresher. I'm all for nice smelling spaces, but overtly powerful and synthetic fragrance in a small space is not only assaulting to my olfactory, but it's in bad taste. Anyhow, the salon was empty except for a woman behind the counter wearing what looked like sweats and a tshirt with a purse slung over her shoulder, a stylist working on a client, another stylist sitting in a chair texting or facebooking on her cell phone... who knows; and a girl sitting in the waiting area, who may have been a personal friend or a patron. It wasn't clear.   The salon itself was simple and attractive. So, I tried my best to take shallow breaths and go ahead with my plan of getting a trim.   I walked to the counter and I asked the woman how much a trim would be. I think she assumed I must be cheap for asking. She was incredibly dismissive. The reason I asked, is coming from LA, Weho and Bev Hills, I'm used to simple trims starting at $80 to $200. I know it's Arizona, but I am so accustomed to inflation that I still ask, just in case. Anyhow, before she would tell me the price she condescendingly corrected me- a trim was a "haircut" and "haircuts" cost $30. My specifying a trim was to let her know I didn't need my locks turned into a Justin Beaver 'do or something. I just wanted a trim, but apparently she is the type that won't allow people to call haircuts, trims. Some times people need to just chill out and let go.  As you can tell her attitude already had me feeling a little annoyed, and she seemed put off by me as well, but I decided to just ignore her and get a haircut. I asked if there was only one stylist on duty, because I wasn't sure if the girl frantically playing on her cell phone was in fact an employee, but apparently she was. I asked if there was a wait and the woman said, no- I'll go let her know. But, the thing is, she didn't go let her know. She sat down the other girl that had been waiting, which was fine- she was there first. She then took  the girls hair out of a pony tail, brushed through it- apologized over and over again for something or other- maybe being late... Then she walked to the back and never said a word to the hairdresser and began getting her supplies ready for her client.   You know, I just can't stand bad service. She may have been the owner for all I know. I mean coming to work in a tshirt and sweat pants...  most employees wouldn't dare. I know I was dressed pretty bummy myself, as I am a permaculture enthusiast and today is my garden day- but I think her unprofessional attitude was a nice forewarning to the rest of her salon's service skills. And honestly, what professional business has the stylists on the floor in plain view of customers texting away on their cell phones? What ever happened to professionalism? I know Arizona is laid back, but it's kind of ridiculous in a business setting. I guess, common sense isn't that common.  Oh.. sorry I got off track. Yes, as I waited and realized that Ms. Attitude wasn't going to promptly inform the stylist that she had a customer I decided to go to another salon- one that actually cares about customers and business. One that values my time as much as their own. Maybe just one that had a friendly face there to say hello.    We'll see how long this place stays open. I can't imagine this business becoming successful.

I kind of feel like the food is overrated... I have been here many times, the service is hit or miss. I don't care how cool the atmosphere is... it's about the basics good food, good service.  Meh.  We only really come here if we have a big work group in town.

I went to the Metro Center location today. I have been thinking about possibly bringing a new addition into my rescued family. However, it bothered me a lot that in order to even pet or meet any of the animals, I had to fill out a complete questionnaire with all of my personal information. I understand that is necessary if you are going to adopt an animal, but just to look at one or pet one?   I felt very uncomfortable being forced to share my personal information when I was basically window shopping. I know they are sweet little animals- don't get me wrong, but I would not adopt on the spot- I would have FIRST meet the dog, 2nd pet the dog and get to know the dog a little bit, THIRD- go home and think it over- Only then would I be ready to adopt and ONLY THEN would all my personal information, including my address, phone number, email, financial and home etc. (all the info they required in order for me to PET a dog)- only then would all that personal information be necessary.  If it's a matter of fear for the animal or theft- I will gladly hand over my ID or sign a disclaimer- but it's incredibly intrusive to require I provide all of my personal information, NOT to ADOPT the dog, but to PET it.  I am a bit irritated, because I think this intrusive requirement in order to meet/pet a dog is off putting and less animals are likely to find good homes. I know for me, I left- and the staff didn't care at all- in fact both of the women showed dismissive and apathetic attitudes. They could care less that I was leaving.   The location looked clean, but the smell in there was awful- the urine and ammonia actually made me a bit sick feeling at first, but I was able to get used to it the longer I was in there. They also had animals mislabeled. For example there was a terrier and the sign said he was a chihuahua... A couple windows said the age was unknown, but they guessed the dogs to be exactly 2 years 10 months an 17 days... What a coincidence? How often does more than one dog meet that exact aging? Maybe there is a backstory somewhere- I bet if they had nice and friendly workers in there- maybe someone might have shared it.  I have decided, I will go to the Human Society when the time comes- Not only am I allowed to pet a dog, meet a dog and take a dog around on a leash- I don't have to provide every detail of my personal life until I am actually ready to adopt an animal.  Just an FYI, I have a home, a great job, a 8000 sq. ft. lot. 2 rescues already- I am willing and able to not only provide for an animal and give one a great home, but also ensure it gets lots of exercise and will have a life full of love and fun times!   I'm disappointed by this experience- also, the adoption fees were steep. Many dogs were listed in the $300 and up range. It's not a matter of not being able to afford it, I was just very surprised as I have never seen prices like that with a rescue organization before.

I liked this place the first time I went, but I just had to walk out due to the poor service. 2pm on a Wednesday, I'm the only person seated at the bar, the restaurant is maybe 20% full. I sit down and wait. The bartender doesn't acknowledge me, no hello, no smile, not even a menu. I have to reach behind the bar for my own menu, decide what to order, but I'm never acknowledged... I'm the ONLY patron-ridiculous! So, I left. Guess I will never be back here... Plenty of options in the area- I go out for the experience more than food, service is extremely important to me. Lousy impression. No wonder they were empty for lunch. I did count 4-5 employees as I waited to be acknowledged as well- no excuse!

It's a dive... nothing special. Usually bad music on the jukebox, some dudes yelling about a ball someone on TV is throwing, pool tables, a cheap bartender... the usual. It get's really interesting during the day... There is an empty "Yarn Shop" next door where the craziest most drugged out lunatics come in and out and pace back and forth outside the establishments in this strip mall... I would say, it's probably not safe at all. Also, last time  a tranny hooker and her Pimp hung  outside the bar for what reason... I don't want to know.

I  love this place- really good- fresh, semi-authentic Mexican faster food. Excellent Taco Shop!  Another reviewer mentioned the decor being tacky (what do people from Ohio know?... j/k). I completely DISAGREE- it's Mexican wrestler themed- fun, hip and trendy- The theme reminds me of El Carmen in LA. If only they served margaritas and beer they would be packed!  The people that work here (maybe the owners?) are very nice- they will let you taste all the different stewed meats. It's been a long time since I've gone to a Mexican establishment in Phoenix that actually serves spicy food. Yum! They do have a Chipotle assembly line style going on, but the food tastes much better. In fact, comparing them to Chipotle never even occurred to me the couple times I have been here until I read that in people's reviews- and I do eat at Chipotle on occasion- but I really don't think this place is anything like Chipotle at all. It's like a Taco Shop- most Taco Shops are set up in a similar style- perhaps you get more "choices" here in regard to "toppings"... I dunno. People are far too critical. Maybe it's because Phoenix is so white bred that the only Taco Shop experience people have is Chipotle, so, they assume that Taco Shops are copying Chipotle... what came first Taco Shop or Chipotle? Chicken or Egg? Plant or seed? Life's questions....  From one gringo to another, this is not an unusual set up for a Taco Shop- it's just a far nicer/trendier interior than an average taco shop- with very good service. Really, it's okay that they let you choose what kind of meat you want on your taco or burrito etc. and make it in front of you. It's probably a lot easier for them to do it this way since I have noticed that the guy working doesn't seem to speak the best English. Either that or he's really on "drugs" like some whitey wrote in a review... I think it's more of language thing than a drug thing... So, I will pretend I didn't read that other racist review that I read and found incredibly offensive- speckled with accusatory undertones because they were charged for guac. Give it a rest Güero!  I don't see anything wrong with the set up, wanted to reiterate that in case my point didn't come across earlier. It's a TACO SHOP...   Even taco trucks let you decide what kind of meat you want and what "toppings"... "Toppings" as if it's a pizza... lol!   Yelp irritates me sometimes... If they had a bowl full of spicy carrots and jalapenos you foodie snobs would be calling it pedestrian.  However, I think it would be nice if they served up some dishes with cotijah cheese, but I digress- Cheese may not have been a traditional element in Mexican cooking as many reviews here mention, but now days it's a staple. Take it or leave it folks, like it or not- Mexican places in Phoenix serve cheese on things. If the cheese makes the food generic- don't get cheese on it. Simple as that. I like cilantro and onions on my stuff personally. You know, most ethnic restaurants offer options to satisfy American palates- there is nothing wrong with the option for cheese. Someone wrote in a review- complaining that this place doesn't serve lingua... Serious? Big Whoop. There are Korean places in town that don't serve DOG- are you all gonna get on your Yelp Machines and start comparing it to... PF Changs or something, lol! Yes, I realize PF Changs isn't Korean, but it's not really Asian food eiether... Look, I'm being a Yelp foodie snob... Pot meet kettle!  I guess what might confuse some is it is almost restauranty, but still casual fast foody. I don't mind that- then again, I'm not one for manicured lawns and beige HOA tract homes. It's human nature to want to compartmentalize, label, file away... I have an over abundance of higher priority life mysteries to dwell on- I like the damn food- and the green chilies are smokin' hot! Nothing tastes bland. I also appreciate the option for cabbage rather than lettuce and I like their salsa choices- I don't mind not having an assortment of 20 different things (this is in response to other critiques). It's a TACO SHOP- I don't expect them to have 20 different salsas- but I do expect the salsas they have to taste fresh and good, and they do! They are also spicy- which gets me HOT!   Coming from LA, this place reminds me of some of the hip taco shops we had over there, just  tastier than many and much nicer/fun decor- really cute.   You have to try this place out- just don't go in there all hoity-toity expecting a white cloth dining establishment. Appreciate it for what it is- a good TACO SHOP.
