Honestly I'm surprised nobody had written a review about their meatballs here. They are amazing!! The come with 5 delicious meatballs that are not too salty and not too sweet, ricotta cheese on the side, and slices of toasted bread. Absolutely to die for item on the menu!!   Apparently people drive all over town to get these! I will come back for them. I was skeptic at first about their 5 item menu, but after the cheese board and meatballs, this place gets jamming with their atmosphere after 10pm and is totally worth it!

I love the vibe of the bar here. I come here every 2-3 weeks for lunch. I always get a sauvignon blanc from New Zealand to pair with my meal. I love the people who dine here, as well as the staff. They are friendly and remember regulars!

The one star is not for my bad experience as a patient, but as an outside observer. I was hired to come take pictures for an on call doctor, and was unable to do so. The main nurse rejected the consent forms and said there has to be a month in process time. So why did I change into scrubs them if you were so sure? The staff was friendly otherwise! However I wouldn't want to get treated by an insensitive, unorganized head nurse. The other Lincoln location's nurses were very sweet with me and went above and beyond to make my experience noteworthy.   Advice? Go to the Lincoln hospital off 101 and 27th st!!!

I am a constant yelper. Wow I didn't even look at the reviews. I just needed to get my nails done so I stopped in!!  I got a mani/pedi gel polish change and had no issues. I just did a simple light pink because it's simple , elegant and professional. The man who did my nails spoke little English, but he did everything right. He soaked, shaped, communicated and tried to be socialable!   I suppose every nail salon is a hit or miss, especially if they have a diverse amount of employees. I'm surprised my experience went so well.

I came in from a recommendation from a friend. He suggested i get the deluxe pedi treatment and gel manicure.   I came in and was greeted right away, sat in a chair and they got right to work on my pedi. They removed my previous gel in about 15 minutes and i got a super nice back massage from the chair. Boy was i sore!  The woman who did me was te. She was awesome. She helped me with nail color suggestions, and actually helped me make a better decision for my manicure choice.  The deluxe pedi was awesome. She scrubbed my legs, got every last bit of polish off my toenails. Very efficient, precise and genuine with her work. She wasnt rushed and didnt make me feel like i was a job. She made me feel like a real person!  I will be back & with friends!

These guys were awesome. I'm definitely coming back!!!    They changed my oil in like 20 minutes on a Saturday.!!  They actually have a bit of sense of humor here as well because they messed with me by changing my speed from MPH TO KPH. For a few minutes I was really confused. Lol but i changed it back real quick on my dashboard. Definitely have me a good laugh after a long day!!!

Great late night eats spot!  I ordered green tea because I was the designated driver and they freshly brewed and strained it right in front of me!! It was so cool.   You have to try the spicy garlic edamame. It is delicious :)

The food is so good. Even when you're full you keep eating. The chicken and ribs come right off the bone.   I've been here easily 10 times and am not disappointed yet. Definitely recommend the jalape√±o cornbread, Brussels sprouts, and the cold avocado/cauliflower salad.   The fresh made lemonade at the bar is bomb too. It's legit almost so sour and not enough sweet.    Xoxox  Fiona

This place is always a shit show. It's either a hit or miss with the clothes, shoes and definitely the bras. However, when you find a treasure it's totally worth the chaotic mess you went through for the past hour!!!

Amazing. Let me list what I would suggest:  -Sake 35 is super smooth -Sake 40 -Chicken & Steak skeweres are amazing -sakito peppers instead of edamame  - Black Cod Miso -Spicy Tuna hand roll  However, if I was to name one thing off the menu to eat and only eat that it would be the Black Mod Soaked in Miso for a few days. It is amazing. My boyfriend thought I was crazy for ordering this dish, and ended up eating half.   After our initial entree orders, we ordered more sashimi toro because the fish literally melted in your mouth it was so delicious.    Ask for Marcus he is the shit!!!! He took care of us even though he wasn't our waiter. We ended up ordering another fresh-to order plate of shasimi with him.

My boyfriend and I are staying at the Bellagio. We were recommended this place, but will definitely not be back. To summarize the restaurants food selection, it is bland, dry and not enticing.   For our drink selection, I ordered the well-known Jordyn Cabernet, which was one of two items that we completed fully from our meal.   We ordered the shrimp cocktail, which was average without horseradish served with the dish. Next the kale salad came which was pretty good. (Keep in mind that every kale salad tastes pretty much the same across the board.)   For our entrees we ordered the 8 oz filet and the sea bass. Much to our surprise, the filet was very dry, even drenched in their 2 house sauces... The sea bass was bland and tasteless in a lobster reduction. Of course, we ordered two sides for our lovely meal thus far: asparagus & truffle mac & cheese. Let me leave my review and thoughts at this, the asparagus was the best part of our dining experiences.

I love this restaurant. It has a great combination of food variety as well as a relaxing ambiance. The staff here has always been friendly, as well as the management.    Today, I came in having one of those bad days, and the manager came up to me in a caring manner asking if I wanted any desserts on the house. I was astonished. He must have overheard me asking the host If we could sit in the corner not near as many guests. I was so touched. That speaks lengths about this company. I already love coming here, but now I will definitely dine here more often.   Nick was our server for lunch and was a sweetheart as well. For appetizers I recommended the ahi tuna with wontons and a avocado, or the crab, artichoke, lobster cheese dip.

Wow amazing food and service! We didn't even have a reservation and they got us in within 10 minutes.   After sitting, we received drinks promptly and ordered. Food came super quick. We ordered the kale salad with shrimp and the salmon plate. Also ordered an appetizer of bruschetta.   We will be back. Good service. Delicious healthy food. Couldn't ask for much more!!!

Have always been a big fan of pei Wei till recently. Today they gave me the wrong order and when I returned to have it corrected, Jessica, the manager tried to tell me that it wasn't  until I showed her the receipt and she rushed to correct it. As well as my husband just pulled a 6 inch strand of plastic wrap out of his fried rice it's safe to say I will not be returning to this location.

Wow! Came in at a total loss of what direction to go to make my own gel nails. The woman working the counter was very helpful. She answered every question I had and followed it up with showing me a product to meet that need. There was also 4 or more people who entered the store while I was there. She was able to facilitate every one of us. I give her kudos at multi-tasking!!!   Thank you sally beauty supply for hiring the right people!!

They always take care of me here! I've leased my 2014 Honda Civic si for almost three years now and I'm definitely going to renew in October to the new one!!  The service center is awesome. Every time I need an oil change or my brakes fixed, Honda always finds a way to go above and beyond for me!! There is either a coupon waiting in my inbox or they find a way to give me a discount when I can't find one! AJ is who usually helps me out and I only have positive words to write about how amicable and satisfactory he has been. They always deeper question any issues needing to be resolved and preform complimentary oil, brake and fluid checks which is fabulous! Honda is on top of things.   For example, I was having issues with my tire pressure, and they got to the bottom of the issue by finding a nail in my tire and patching it for me! (Money saved and problem solved :) )  Another time, I had a front brakes coupon, but it was my back brakes that needed to be replaced and he applied a similar coupon and an additional $25 off from their website for me! No questions asked. The wait is usually fairly quick and I couldn't ask for a better home base for my baby car.    Thank you Honda!!!

To start off with appetizers! The scallops are to die for with the thick tomato sauce. It is served with cheese focassia bread.  We also had the shrimp cocktail. They came out thick and cold with a crisp and sharp sauce that gave it a good crunch with each bite.   For dinner you can't go wrong with the filet. It melts like butter in your mouth. I order it medium rare so the flavor stays in the steak and when cut, the juices leak out the sides.

We started off with the pride merlot. It is the best merlot you can ever drink. Then we progressed to the seafood platter, which was to die for.

They have a good selection but not that many people shop here so a lot of the food goes bad. However I like the ability to order food and eat it here. They have a variety of selection to choose from pho to buffalo burgers to gluten free pizza to oar he chicken bowls. You can't go wrong with one of the healthiest options to shop at in Arizona!

I just moved here and I was looking up stylist in the area Anthony Vigil kept coming up over and over.  I also went to the extension Hairshop in Scottsdale and everyone there highly recommended him for not only extensions but also my blonde hair color.  I know it's so hard to find a hairstylist that actually knows what they are doing I got very lucky with Anthony and he will be my hairdresser forever!!! Thank you so much!

So my buddy knows Kevin, the main guy here. Greg is unfortunately on medical leave. So we decided to have another woman help us who works here. Her name is Teg. From the get go, she has been frustrating. It's like we are pulling teeth to make a business cards. We asked for the book of deisgn layouts and she gave us the wrong booklets. So I took it upon myself to go in the corner where she had a whole stack and ended up finding the large 2 foot thick binder of business card designs.   After finding a good layout, we write down the paper product id, the font, and email her- verbatim the wording we want on front and back. She was still having issues understanding what we wanted and needed. She kept talking to us with concern about how much extra te cost would be for media on the card or the glossy vs matte finish.   Finally, we arrive at a somewhat decent mutual understanding, and are told that drafts will be emailed tonight.   Boy do I have a headache. I hope nothing goes wrong!

This place is quite a catch. I would never have guessed such a high end restaurant would be at a casino. From the live music ambiance to the glassware for drinks, it is quite exquisite. I will definitely be coming back. We came in Christmas Eve and were delighted by the welcoming lights that decorated each floor of the casino, and the restaurant itself.   After a few cocktails in the lounge area, we were escorted to our table. The experience was communicative and fluid from start to finish.

Rick was a charismatic and proffessional server. We will be back to specially request him. He was tentative, friendly, respectful and knowledgeable.   The food was phenomenal. Definately a great catch for fresh seafood in Scottsdale with a fine dining experience.   The banana' foster for dessert was mind-blowing. I have always been a fan of Mastro's butter cake, until now. Eddie V's has replaced my favorite dessert with their banana foster dish!!!

Jennifer is absolutely amazing. She is a sweetheart. She always goes out of her way to make sure she has everything taken care of for you. She is also very well at prescribing the RIGHT medication for you and not just grabbing her pad and med-ding you up!  I've gone here for almost a year. The front desk lady, Nancy is a complete sweetheart  as well. Always leaving me the cutest voicemails if I don't answer. Great positive vibe here. Everything is run smoothly.

What a great healthy spot for a late eats! I absolutely love their food here. You can't go wrong with a protein bowl or a smoothie. My personal favorite in the mornings is their juice cleanse drinks!! All fresh squeezed vegetables and fruit that can be absorbed quickly by your body for vitamins and nutrients!   Today, I ordered the pi√±a-kale-ada smoothie with strawberries instead of bananas and coconut water! I also devoured a shrimp protein bowl that included quinoa, vegetables and sweet potato hash! Boy my body must love me!!!!   I will be back because I always can use a healthy dinner after I get off work that is quick and to go. Thank you creators of Chop Shop! I will be sending you a Christmas card.

Love this store. There is so much variety in oil and vinegar. You have you're sweet ones that can be paired for salads and marinades -- then there is the more bitter or flat line tastes that give just a jump of flavor.   As soon as we walked in we weren't bombarded with trying to be sold, the employees are laid back and very helpful. The ambiance in here is perfect. Couldn't ask for a better presentation of product.   Will be back!

I love this place! I've been here a billion times. It's a great place to grab food when it's past 10pm and everywhere else has closed. They serve food until 1:30. If any of you are from out of town, the youll like the vibe of this joint. It's awesome music, intimate lighting & spacing, good-variety of food and the staff is personable.   I have been a fan of their pizzas and bolognese pasta. Their moscule mules are bomb and so is Cabernet.    I'm a constant attendee.

Wont be back. Super sad one of my friends owns this.  Also they need more than two mexican beers! Dos XX and Cornona dont count!!

This place has excellent customer service and a great rewards program. I don't drift elsewhere when I buy my vape juice or upgrades in battery watts. They have always taken care of me. I have brought three of my friends here to buy vape set-ups!! It is a great alternative to smoking cigarettes.

I came here for my birthday on a Monday night. We sat at the bar where we proceeded to have the worst bartender of our life attempt to serve us in a non representable manner for their well-known concept chain of hospitality. I've eaten here before and never had a problem, but this time I will never come back due to the bad taste in our mouths after our short dining experience.   The bartender spent 5-10 minutes in between us tasting a sample of wine to find the right one to come back and ask us if we wanted to order the specific Blend of Pinot. I was frustrated. We were the only people at the bar besides a server eating dinner next to me at the bar.   I don't even want to get into the whole scenario but long story short, when we left she got a 20% tip instead of my boyfriends normal 30% and she promised to "make it up to us next time".... Honey, there won't be a next time.   That is not how he runs his restaurants. You fix it while the guest is still there so they leave happy!!

This spot is perfect for a Sunday Funday or  a Friday night out. A group of my girls from ASU stopped in and got a table. We got a few free bottles and danced our asses off! I will definitely be coming back. Everyone here is super cool and is down for a good time.

I love this place. It's right in between the fine dining of Mission and Loco Patron.   We ordered the guacamole, bbq tacos, chicken lime bowl and salmon bowl. Each had its own unique flavorful taste. We were satisfied with every one. I don't think you go wrong with ordering food from here!  It paired nicely with a michilada, which was made well and not poorly like most bar. There was crushed salt on the rim, real tomato juice and a big juicy lime.   Everything came out fast, the waitress was prompt with refilling our waters and taking good care of us. We even got a deal for checking in on yelp! A taco and beer combo for $5!  We will be back because it's a great little lunch spot.

I went to this restaurant with my girlfriends for her birthday party on a Saturday night with no reservation and the manager was able to get me a table. We ordered drinks and they were amazing. The server gave us some great recommendations because we weren't familiar with the menu. Everything that we ordered tasted amazing and we had absolutely no issues. It was a little loud in the dining room but overall, we were very happy with the service and the experience and we will be back, the spiga salad and chicken spaghetti was to die for. Our server was so friendly and adorable, I don't remember his name but he had the prettiest blue eyes I've ever seen. We will definitely be back.

I came in after a long day and flight delay of three hours. They helped solve all my problems. They were very courteous with letting me taste wines until I was satisfied with a blend of silver Palm.   I was able to get a decent amount of work done on my computer while at the bar. Which was duely needed!!   The pesto chicken pizza is to die for and is a must have. The meatballs were also delicious.

We sat at the bar Sunday night around 7pm for 10 minutes and had two bartenders pass us by with no hello or even a water to start. Finally, we have another person join our party and got a round of drinks. Good lord we couldn't hear anything because the music was so loud. We decided to resolve the issue by taking a booth spot in the corner, and were assigned the server named Michael.   He completely turned around our experience by being overly attentive on our drink orders, appetizers and a friendly person to converse.   We will be back for Michael, but they have to lower the music for sure! It was hard for my dad with hearing issues to keep a conversation with me.

Great vibe. Love the live music. The owner does everything, he sings, smoozes the guests, keeps an eye on the place and keeps the vibe going. Even though me and my friend Stephen were the only white people here, it was so much fun!!! Best hookah bar in az by far!!!
