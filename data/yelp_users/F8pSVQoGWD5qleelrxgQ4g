The best, unknown Mexican food in Phoenix.  Homemade tortillas, fresh tasting food, very authentic.  Chips and salsa are amazing.

Melt-in-your-mouth, homemade donuts. Very fresh and a variety of choices. Small, locally owned and friendly. I'm hooked already.

Excellent haircut experience, downtown great setting and barber is very laid-back. Only down-side is it can be a long wait, but you know it's good!

Horrible customer service. I called in an order, waited 30 minutes for it, kept checking on it, and it turns out they never started preparing it.  One customer in line told me she waited 1 hour for her food; meanwhile, workers were taking breaks getting fountain drinks while customers were waiting.

Walked right in on my lunch hour and had a great fade haircut from Sam. Reasonably priced and a nice, crisp haircut. The place isn't real nice inside, but the service was prompt and the haircut was great. I'll go back again.
