I found my dog, Quincy, at the PRAH.  He was one of their rescued puppies.  He loved the staff and is one of the most confident dogs I've ever met.  He was obviously treated extremely well by their staff!  I could especially tell they really loved their patients/animals because I was screened to see if I was a good fit for him and when we left they were all sad to see him go.  Plus for a mere $300 that we paid we got our wonderful Quincy, neutered, microchipped and all his shots done. I would recommend PRAH to anyone in the area near or far.

Green flannel was delicious as was the fresh squeezed orange juice! My husband had the banana nut cakes and also loved them.  We had great service and the servers actually seemed happy to be working here, which is a nice change of pace. Will definitely return!

On a Sunday afternoon we happened to run into my in-laws in old town, so we decided to find a place to sit down and grab drinks and possibly appetizers.  When we walked in the hostess was hesitant on seating us on the roof if we weren't going to eat. We said we weren't sure yet. It wasn't like it was full - there was perhaps 2 tables seated up there. So she finally sat us up there and we might have ordered food except service was so slow.  I don't think we'll return.

Little Chicago is our go-to delivery pizza in our neighborhood.  We used to live upstairs from an awesome pizza joint in Boston and I was disappointed when we moved into our south Scottsdale neighborhood that there weren't any good pizza places close by or that delivered, but then we found Little Chicago.  Their pizza is thin crust (my fave) and has just the right amount of sauce, toppings, etc.  Their wings are good too and always have just the right amount of sauce and heat.  If it's Friday night and we don't want to cook or we're having people over and want to have pizza, Little Chicago gets our business every time :)  They are very prompt with delivery and their drivers are always friendly.

My brother-in-law was actually playing a gig here and that's what brought us in.  We had walked by many times, but not actually stopped in.  Love this bar.  Service is laid back, but excellent and it's just a great place to relax with friends, watch a game, listen to music, or just people watch all the passersby walking through the plaza.  Will definitely return!
