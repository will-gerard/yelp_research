These reviews are cracking me up. They must be family members who are trying to keep this place in business. Please, do not go here if you want anyone to take your order or even acknowledge your existence. And more importantly if you want to enjoy a good pizza. YUCK! I have never seen employees walk in as miserable to be somewhere as I saw them walk into this gross, smelly, boring restaurant. The dude answering the phone at the bar actually rolled his eyes at the person trying to make a reservation for 14. We went out of our way to come here; what a waste of a pizza night!!  Awful experience, and even worse food! So bummed we spent any money here. Won't happen again.

This place is really, really fun!  There is stuff going on all around you. The service was good even though we had almost 20 people in our group. We had a hot dog, slider and soft pretzel from the happy hour menu (goes until 7 which is nice) and it was all delicious and fresh. I heard the wings were especially good too. We will definitely be coming back.

Good golden wings and chips, but the service is not that good.

We went there with over 20 people on Wednesday and they took awesome care of us! I think our server's name was Michelle and she worked her butt off and the bartender did too. The food was delish and we will definitely go back!

I got a slightly bad feeling when I walked in to pick up our carry out order. It smelled like sewage!  There were three servers chit chatting in the front and one quickly pointed to the bar when I told the I was picking up. The small bar was fairly full, and lots of conversations going on. I had to stand behind two people who were really involved in conversation and I was practically on top of them and awkward. The bar tender didn't acknowledge me for a few minutes even though she looked right at me. Finally she grabbed my order and was super rude. She was definitely having a bad day.  The place was empty other than the bar, and I don't know why they don't use the servers who aren't busy to take care of the carry out orders!?  Finally got home with the food.  Wow.  My husband opened his Jumbo Smoked Chicken dinner.  It was quite small, and just unappealing altogether.  Posted a photo of it, check it out.  The taste was like "rubbery ham".  GROSS.  Next I opened my smoked chicken breast sandwich.  Bun = hard, meat = full of fat chunks and gristle, sauce = the cheapest bottle at the store . Had to take off more than half of the "meat".  You can get better meat in precooked packages at the grocery store.    I will never eat here again and can not believe people go here at all.  NASTY.

It's just not good Mexican food at all. The only way you get good service is to sit at the bar. We still go there to sit at the bar, drink and play trivia, but not for the salsa, cold chips, cold bean dip and blah food.  Unfortunately I can't recommend a better Mexican food place around here either.

Avoid this location. Ya it's fast food, but I still expect it to be at least warm and semi fresh. Every time I have been here the food is cold! Get it together "managers". It's fast food, not that damn hard.

I decided on the green chile pork mixed w beans chimichanga  w red chile sauce. So good! The pork was small cubes, not too much beans. The sauce was perfect; flavorful and not overpowering. Came w small sides of beans and rice. The take out order comes w a generous portion of chips and the salsa of your choice. We got hot and it was. We also got the grilled chicken burrito w green chile sauce. The green chile sauce was hot and not as flavorful as the red, but still very good. Finally, the grilled chicken soft tacos in corn tortillas. The chicken was diced small. Perfect.   The woman that rang me up was super nice and mentioned that my order was checked twice.  That made me feel good so I didn't have to do it myself.    I hope you give this place a try and I can't wait to get breakfast burritos on Sundays!  Update: 1/4/13.  They no longer give generous portions of chips or hot sauce which is a bummer.  They don't even give you enough hot sauce for the number of items you order.  They've also left things out of our to-go order several times since our first visit.  Their food is still really good so we'll keep going back for now.

It's never easy for me to leave my doggies with complete strangers and no idea how they are being treated. But I will definitely go back to Pawsattraction. They seem like really caring people and did a great job on my two small dogs. Brianna is very sweet and offered to do another nail trim at no charge in a couple of weeks.

We had a not so great experience. We spent our whole night waiting for things (we were there for almost three hours and not by choice!). The worst part was the end of the night when we waited at least 45 min to get our check. Asked about it several times. When asked to talk to the mgr we were told there was no manager there!?!?  This place needs a manager on site at all times! We want to come here again because the food wasn't bad for bar food, it's a great location, and the happy hour is awesome. But we can't spend that much time waiting around when we go out.

Went here last night and it was good! Place was packed but that's to be expected since it's new (used to be grimaldis here), it was Friday, and the location. They take reservations so we'll remember that next time. Service was great! Sat at the bar waiting for a table and the bartenders were awesome! We got seated on the patio which was nice. Ordered lasagna to share and a pizza to take home. Yummy yummy! They were nice enough to split the lasagna for us and I can't believe how HUGE the portion was! We thought they might have misunderstood and given us two separate orders, but no that was not the case. The pizza was really good too. We will definitely be back.

Extremely disappointed. Two sandwiches took over 30 minutes! The place was full of smoke and to top it off, after waiting that long and paying 23 (yes 23!!!) dollars, got the sandwiches home and one was wrong. Ordered the razzle dazzle, and it doesn't come w mayo or mustard so asked for that sauce which was not on there, and they left off the tomato so it was the driest sandwich ever.  The chicken was dry and there was way too much bread as well.  And finally, if avocado was on it I certainly couldn't find it!  I have been wanting to try this place for a long time and I doubt I'll be back. Hope it gets better or they won't stay for long, even in that great location.
