Ok this is how my evening started:My friend Katy and I walked into Aunt Chilada's restaurant At Squaw Peak on 6/28/2014 to have a awesome dinner. The place had a few parties going on, but as usual it seemed under staffed. So my friend and I sat down and we were given chips and salsa and a bottle of water. About 5-10 minutes later a family came in with small children and after about another 5 minutes or so,  all of sudden a waiter comes out and looked me right in the eye and went to the other table and took their order. Turned around and went back in to the kitchen. Of course this pissed me off. We got up and hostess saw me I explained what happen she said it was her fault. That did not make it OK. The waiter should have said something to us and didn't. So we left Aunt Chilada's in discuss and went down the road to Ajo Al's for a awesome meal and great service..  So now we are at Ajo Al's for the first time and I was speechless when I walked out. The service was outstanding our waitress was Theresa who was very professional & friendly. And the food was excellent. As another Yelper  - Steve V was right about the Cheese Queso Dip it was very tasty.  I will be going back to Ajo Al's again soon.

I went to this Fry's on Friday the 1/24/14 and I was there to pick up 2 veggie trays for a party at work. I picked up 2 veggie trays and fruit juice poured out all over my slacks and I was upset. I asked to speak to a manager. Now remember I said veggie tray not fruit tray, so when I explained this to a manager who finally arrived he said he was not sure why that happened and was going to find out what and how it happened. So in the mean time Jerry Cruz the manager wanted to know what he could do for me, and I suggested he pay my cleaning bill but instead he offered to purchase the different trays I decided to buy. Thank you Jerry for making it right for me.

Okay so here I am writing a review about some place that I went on Friday, September 12.  I went to the Tempe location with some friends from Shutterfly. The parking is horrible as you can't find anything unless you want to walk three blocks away, they need to fix that but I got lucky I found a very very close parking space I parked I walked I had a cold beer had a good time with my friends from Shutterfly maybe somebody could rent a lot somewhere around there get a bus and charge to park there have a bus take you to Four Peaks have fun then when ready to leave, have bus take you back to car. Wow what a concept college kids are they not thinking.  Enough about the parking issue. Moving on now. But while I was there and I had the peach beer it was awesome the fish and chips was off the charts and you are probably wondering if I will go back  - Yes of course!

Well a friend told me about this place and I wanted to try it. So Margie and I hung out today so we did a few things and then came here for a meal. We were greeted by Susan who was a delight and Brett was our fine looking server. The two of them were very professional yet friendly:). So Margie and I ordered a appetizer Ticoz Guacammus w/pita bread.  Margie ordered the Pork Chile Verde Enchiladas - yummy. I ordered the Blue Corn Enchiladas with chicken OMG I can't tell you how awesome our meals were. Margie and I shared our plates so we can each try them. They have a sweet tamale mixture that is really tasty. Thank you Susan & Brett for sharing and explaining the different sauces.  I do plan on coming back for more awesome meals.

I came in here as I had not been in a while. Now I remember why. The manager on duty is yelling rather loudly at an employee about putting on his headset so she can talk to him. Well if she was any kind of manager she would have walked over and spoke to this person in a more professional manner and not screaming. It sort of reminded me of a showing of undercover boss on how some mangers think they can get away with treating team players disrespectful. I told another customer if I was that employee I think I would have walked out or asked to speak to her in the office. After speaking to a friend she said that was the right thing to do is to make these comments on yelp so other people will see that you can't be disrespectful to your coworkers or your team members. I am hoping that the District manager Miss Dalrymple will see this post on yelp and do something about it,  the sad part about it is nobody in the store did not  consider that I could've been either a undercover district manager or a Wendy's  shopper.

Sarah with the Pink watch(inside joke) My friend Katy and I went to Kitchen 56 for dinner on 6/25/11 for the first time. Katy had the Delux Burger with bacon and egg and she said it was out standing. Myself I had the Pulled pork sandwich and it was awesome the bbq sauce did not over power the meat which is a good thing. Both meals were very hot and had lots of good flavors,the french fries were not store bought and cooked just right non-greasy. The service was excellent and everyone was very personable. As for the drinks Green Tea Lemonade with vodka was yummy,and we wanted the peanut butter chocolate mousse a were told they don't carry it any longer (boo hoo) so we had the fruit pizza with chocolate dipping sauce and we both feel that it needs improvement..... Yes we will be back... Excellent atmosphere..................

Today I wanted to go back to Kitchen 56 for dinner with my best friend Katy Andrew. We were hoping that the young lady who waited on us the last time would be there. And there she was Sara who by the way had a Large White watch (inside joke). She was as business and friendly as the first time.    The hostess sat us at a table for 4 people and this family came in and they looked like they really wanted to have dinner at the Kitchen 56 and I felt they Katy and I did not need a table for 4 so as they were leaving I stood up and flagged them to stay and gave up our table and we moved to a table for 2. This family was much appreciated, I said to them if I do something nice for someone else someone will do something nice for someone else. I felt I did what was right. The hostess was so happy that she gave Katy and I 2 free desserts.  Now for what we had for dinner I had the pork ribs with fries, corn cake and house slaw it was off the charts. Katy had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy and she said it was awesome.  The desserts we had were a brownie with berry sauce and vanilla ice cream and the second one was a baked chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. The whole meal was awesome.  We wanted to make the family feel special so we had Sara give them the Fudge Brownie dessert after we left. I would have loved to see their faces when it arrived.  Keep up the good work Kitchen 56 your the best.

Oh my god today I decided to try Bosa donuts and I got a buttermilk donut today with a Thai tea with boba and now I am addicted. I was shocked to see that you can get 1 dozen donut holes for .99 cents. My coworkers will love me on Friday.

I really like using Yelp but could not find this location on here and I knew it was just around the corner from my house so I went over there and grabbed a business card so I can add it to the list of good ice cream in the Arcadia area. I was very impressed with the smiles and the welcome I got when I walked in here tonight with my friend. When we got there we found so many good choices and the young lady behind the counter seemed to enjoy what she does and the makes me want to go back for more.

The first time I stopped in was New Years Eve picked up a menu around 2:00 PM and was told that they would be open later i th evening. I called in around 5:15 PM and was told they were closed for New Years Eve. I was shocked, the person I talked to was very very sorry for the inconvenience this caused me and promised me a free pizza. I thought like this guy is not going to remember me. Well to my surprise Scott the owner did remember me and he pulled out the piece of paper that he wrote my name on New Years Eve about the Free Pizza. I was really impressed or should I say shocked that this man did this. So today I went in and ordered the Pesto Chicken pizza and OMG it was awesome. The crust is nice, not to thin not to thick and the chicken pieces were small chunks, not shredded or bland tasting. I will be back to try Queen Margherita Pizza.  I will support Rustic Pizza because the staff is awesome and the Scott the owner is priceless.  Happy New Year to all. - Jodi O
