I ordered a Cornish pasty on Wednesday December 2, 2015.  It was served with a piece of hard plastic rivet or grommet inside. I discovered this piece of hard plastic by bitting into it. The staff was not helpful and in fact turned out to be extremely rude. She did not bring a manager. She made no  effort to correct this gross service. Obviously these food items come some factory some where. This is a dangerous and unhelpful bar and grill in my experience.  Having just traveled in Great Britain I find this establishment an insult to Queen and Country. The men's restroom had a broken urinal, graffiti on the walls, and urine on the floor. I loved the pictures of the Royals on the walls, but I am sure they are ashamed of the conditions of this establishment.

Went to Mijannas last night. What I love is getting Pita Bread fresh from their brick oven hot and puffy and steaming and wrapped in a red towell in a nice basket retaining the heat and  the freshness. They have wonderful dishes to complement their fresh Pita. The Fresh Pita starts out too hot touch. They have wonderful toppings for the Fresh Pita. The Fresh Hot Pita tastes and smells and feels so greatl that the mishmash of imperfections of this authentic Lebanese restaurant fade into insignificance!

We needed home security and personal security. Empire's agent Steve Julian was prompt and professional. The systems are state of the art. Their pricing is very competitive!
