For $80, I expect that everything would be spotless, not just my floorboards. All of my windows are streaked, it looks like they swiped a dirty rag across, inside and out. The dash looks ok, but the console is crap. It looks like only the places people might look at were clean, everything else was left alone. I will not be returning despite the closeness to my house.

The long lines are completely worth it. My favorite place to go after an early morning weekend run. Or a later morning hangover. Or any morning at all really.

I have been renting for the past two years, traveling around the state for work. While I have generally had a pleasant experience with Enterprise, things have gone rapidly downhill at this location. Between the staffing changes, the dirty cars, and the long delays, I will not be returning to this branch, or possible any Enterprise at any point in the near future.   I do need to say that when I spoke with the manager at my visit end of last week regarding how dirty the car was, she was very pleasant and seemed genuinely concerned about the issue. However, the problems I have had at this branch continue to occur and it seems to be the end of the road for me and Enterprise.
