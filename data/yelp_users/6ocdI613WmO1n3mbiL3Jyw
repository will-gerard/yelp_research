Terrible experience! Placed an order before deadline for my son's "Spirit Pack" for High school football. Said if we ordered by deadline we would receive it in time for his football camp. Received text 2 hours before he needed to go on the bus to camp and said we could come by and pick up. Left work early to pick up and asked to be reimbursed for freight charges since they didn't ship it and they said NO Sorry. Thought that was a very poor way to treat a customer.

Called Ron, gave me a price of $59 to Auger my clogged toilets at my shop, Beck Racing Engine. Said he'd be right over and in 40 minutes he was! He said he could not guarantee results but was able to clear all three and they are now working great!Ron , Thanks again for your prompt & courteous service!
