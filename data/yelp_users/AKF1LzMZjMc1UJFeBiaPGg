I go this place often. Curry is always good and the coconut chicken soup is the best in the valley. I order rice with the soup. Yummy!!! Service is usually not the best. I have had a lot of frustrations trying to do pick up orders. They don't answer the phone or put you on hold forever and forget about you....but once you get your food its worth it!!

I really dont write reviews but my experience here was so terrible that I have to try to help anyone from experiencing the same thing. I ended up in this business through Groupon. Let me start by saying that I am a massage therapist of almost 14 years and have worked for and have been going to chiropractors for many years.  When I first entered I was greeted by no one for more than 20 mins.  All you see when you come in is a dry erase board telling you to sign in and an arrow pointing to the bathroom and an empty desk. I sat down an waited.  At the end of the short hallway I could a man sitting at a desk internet surfing.  After a few minutes I realized it was the doctor who owns the business!!  He did not come and introduce himself to me or even look my way the entire time I was there. Not even to tell me hello and someone would be with me shortly.  When phone calls came in he would put them on speaker phone to talk so I could hear everything. The office is very plain. No pictures or any kind of warmth is there at all.  When I went to the bathroom there was no soap to wash my hands! So finally the massage therapist comes to get me and she is dressed in pajama shorts, and flip flops.  She look like she just rolled out of bed. In the intake I told her that I wanted medium pressure and that I didnt like elbows. For the entire hour she only worked on my back and neck face down and she DRILLED into me with her elbows. It was the worst massage I have ever had and Ive had massages in third world countries!! She spent the first fifteen minutes of the massage trying to pitch me on buying a massage membership. She had filled what looked like an old wet wipe container with lotion and she dipped her hands in it to apply lotion to my body. Its the same lotion she is using on every other client. So unsanitary and against code! A pump bottle is like $2!!!  And heres the cherry on top....as she is drilling her elbow into my back she was TEXTING ON HER PHONE.  She was texting with one hand and killing me with her elbow.  Its my own fault I didnt say anything. I should have stopped the appt 5 minutes in but I didnt. I was in pain for days after that and had to get another massage a few days later to fix it. Theres more I could write but I think you got the picture.  I have never in my life been somewhere with this bad of customer service. Never.

I never leave reviews but after going to Clever Koi this weekend I just had too. I will start by saying that the drinks and ambiance  were very good. The vibe there is really cool. The FOOD on the other hand.... Was terrible. I wanted to like this place so badly. Growing up in Hawaii I have spent most of my life eating Japanese food. I have had Japanese food all over the country and in japan. Out of the 7 dishes we ordered only one person liked their meal. My ramen was so bad I couldn't finish it....and considering that the portion was very small that says a lot. I left hungry. I told the waitress that I did not enjoy the meal and that most of us at the table were very disappointed...she said "oh I'm sorry. That's too bad." And that was it. I've been working in service for over 15 years. I was very surprised at that response and that no one came over to ask about our experience or even to offer a drink or dessert. I didn't want or expect a comp of my meal but considering the reviews and that this place is newer I would think they would have tried to turn around a table of 7s opinion. If you want good drinks and ambiance...go. If you want great Japanese food I wouldn't recommend it.
