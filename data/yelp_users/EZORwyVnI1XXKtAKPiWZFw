*************************** Unsanitary Conditions ************************** last time we ate at this "establishment" a cock roach crawled across the bar.  When we told the owner we were told that a shipment of produce was infected by roaches. No offer to refund the meal was offered. We delivered an email of disapproval to the owner upon which she responded with refunding the meal.  today when we returned for the first time since that unfortunate incident the owner informed us we were no longer welcome in her establishment.   It seems a roach infestation had lowered her Maricopa Health department score - which somehow was our fault for indicating to her that there was a problem.  very disappointing.  This is a restaurant i've enjoyed for years and years but will never dine at again.

Great local Mexican spot. In surprise our choices are limited... So a great local establishment such as this deserves our praise. I'll eat here any day of the week.

Easily the best desert I've ever had. Eat here ASAP. From the service to the drinks, this place is five stars all day long. Well done Sel.. We will not forget this Mother's Day anytime soon.

Surprise has needed a place like this for some time. Food was good, but the local beer and wine selection and ambiance made the entire experience fantastic. We'll be back many, many times!
