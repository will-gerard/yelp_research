I must admit that I'm a bit of a regular here. My husband, daughter and I have been coming here for years. Usually, my daughter and I split a pizza while the hubby gets pasta.  The pizzas are amazing--well balanced sauce with a crispy, buttery crust.  The pastas (especially the Aurora sauce and the baked ziti) are delicious!  On a recent trip, however, I went out of my norm and ordered the salmon salad. Amazing!  The salad was cold, crisp and fresh...nicely dressed with a light Italian vinaigrette. The salmon was warm and cooked perfectly--the perfect balance to the cold salad.  The owner is always present, making sure that Quality Control is key.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  When in doubt, try it!!!

Mediocre food. Mediocre service.  Enough said. No need to return for overpriced, chain food.

Every time I come to Havana Cafe, it's a great experience.  The service is always quick and efficient and the food is always excellent.  A few of the dishes that I love are the Ropa Vieja, the Picadillo, the Pollo Ajillo, and their sandwiches.  Their tapas are always worth trying too.  Dessert?  To die for.  I'd definitely recommend Havana Cafe to my friends.

We were blown away with both the food and the service.  We ordered the Buttermilk Chicken and the Pork Tenderloin; both were outta this world!  The Green Corn Tamale was incredible.  Amazing customer service!!!  Can't wait to try their weekend brunch.  We will definitely come back her often.

Catch 22 has become our go-to when it comes to when we just don't feel like cooking and want something close and easy.  It's a relaxed casual atmosphere with great food, great drinks and good service.

Belfiore has become one of my favorite local Italian joints to frequent. The food is always amazing and the dishes are large enough to eat family style which makes it that much more affordable.  The reason I rated them a 4 star instead of a 5 is because of the lack of consistency in good service.  Most of the time, it's wonderful, but there have been times when they are understaffed, and the flow of service seems  discombobulated and hectic.    If you're looking for great, local Italian food, this is definitely the place for you.  If the girls seem overly busy, just breath and be patient--after all, they are running not only the restaurant, but the deli/bakery portion of the building too.

I love Humble Pie.  They have a great lunch special and a great Happy Hour.  The service is always great and there is rarely a wait.  The goat cheese pizza is amazing!

I'm confused in giving this rating.  The food was always great, hence the 4 stars, but their website is "down for maintenance" and when I call it rings and rings and says, "Thank you for calling, but Rochelli's is now closed."    Are they out of business?

Great food.  Great service. The tagliatelle was AMAZING and the Chicken Parmesan was incredible.  I can't wait to come back and try the pizza.

The buffet was huge with a ton of options but nothing I had was very good.  It was really expensive too for mediocre food.

I sadly give North Mountain a less than enthusiastic review because I had such high expectations.  Unfortunately, while the beer was fairly good, the service needed some serious attention.    We went the day after the grand opening and waited ten minutes for them to figure out where they were going to seat us when they had more than half of their tables available.  Then, it took another fifteen minutes for us to get a server who would take our drink and appetizer order.  By the time we finally got our beers and pretzels, we were so discouraged that we opted to go have dinner elsewhere.    Also, this place isn't nearly as kid friendly as most of the other breweries in town--it's mostly an eclectic adult menu--or if they have a kids menu, nobody told us about it. I would definitely give them another shot, but they need to figure out how to serve their patrons in a more organized fashion.
