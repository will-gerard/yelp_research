After being gone for two years, I was extremely excited about coming back to this restaurant and extremely disappointed to find the most hateful hostess waiting to seat me. There was not a welcoming smile or even look when she asked number of party. She then explained how to find our table and told us to go sit and she would bring the menus along. First impression of one of my favorite past times was horrible, however, the server was amazing and the food was delicious. Must try the honey-crisp  chicken salad!

The moment I walked in, I was treated with excellent service and my pedicure was done quick and easy. I will definitely be a returning customer.

Well first off the food is mediocre. The owner is an ass hole. We were trying to enjoy Mother's Day and he instructed his wait staff to clean our table with us sitting there. Thanks for ruining my Mother's Day. Do not visit this location, their other location on Elliot and 48th has MUCH better manners. But remember, the food is mediocre!
