I had such a great time out of the three times Ive been there, oh yea this was a first! And actually the servers in the past have been very rude and normally they all judge you before they even arrive to the table to ask for drinks! I server tables as well and I know that if I don't give a great customer experience a couple of thing could happen they won't come back, they won't tip accordingly and they would just tell others how much the service sucked!     Now our new server Amy she's a beast I give her 5 stars the only reason why I'm not giving a full five stars to Applebee's yelp is just because Applebee's will need to prove to me that they value customers! I'll be back but only if Amy can serve me!   FYI stake was good!

I give them 5 stars cause this place is my go to spot for a good local draft beer. I.P.As like Octoberfest  are my favorite they also have pale Ales and porters. They sold me on this on my very first visit. Great deals on beer Tuesday Thursday and Sunday. The employees are very helpful and I assure you this isn't my last visit.

Okay so I'm just going to tell you this place is a must go to for any event! Melting pot was very clean, quite and very peaceful. I choose this place cause the overloads of great news I heard about the food! Not only is the food amazing but the server and other employees are very helpful.   Marcus was my server and I'll give him 5 stars he was great to us and answered any questions we had. He was very confident in the menu and questions that I asked him.  Not only am I going to tell people about this place but I believe I found a new spot to add to my weekly outing!   Marcus and victor you guys ROCK!

Sorry but I have to do this I came to off on Thursday may 7th to participate in customer appreciation day (8piece mix for 7.99) sound like a great deal I was excited for my meal. First off I wasn't impress with the guy speaking over the intercom (he didn't sound welcoming at all ) with my coupon i waited 20 minutes in the drive thur for food before I even had gotten to the window to pay. I still remained humbled and waited an extra 5 minutes no one came to charge me for my order or even to say sorry and that they had difficulties expediting orders.  I would've waited longer then but I had no customer service reaction with any of employees. As I looked inside employees where talking to each other as if everyone was confused if this was my business I would start doing drug screening! There is no reason I should have waited almost a half hour for FASTFOOD! So far WORST KFC I've been too in the Phoenix area.

This location is definitely going to get more visits by me. I expected poor customer service as I received in the pass from other D.D. I happy with the service and happy with the taste of my doughnut and strawberry banana smoothie. This was a great start to my evening since today is my first day back to work.

Came all they way from downtown Phoenix cause I was craving a banana shake but the machine was broke down, which put a damper on my night but the fries and hamburger made up a little! Can't wait for the rally's to open in my phoenix so the drive isn't as long. Don't get me wrong it was worth it.

Every thing is pretty good I normally go to Detroit coney but this place is closer to where I live I like the burgers but it was my first time so the kid upsold me on jalapeño chili cheese fries but I only wanted the cause I thought they where diced jalapeños he said it was but maybe he heard sliced! But I like the place overall I'll be back.

If I could give them NO stars I would DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE I REPEAT DO NOT GO HERE.    Because I am not a female. Because I chose to go to a heterosexual setting. Because I chose to be comfortable with who I am. Because I made the decision to get on a pole in a club and have fun. I was grabbed and put in a choke hold, separated from my friends, and thrown multiple times up against walls and got put in an elevator where again I was man handled by 2 men twice my size and held up against the wall by my neck. All because I'm gay. I was taken out of the club and for all but ten minutes tried to gather myself to try and process what had just happened to me and why. Cops proceeded to follow me and my friends out of the club and surround me. While my friends are trying to explain what happened to me while we were inside 2 cops came around a barricade of cops and proceeded to arrest me for assault and disorderly conduct, again for me having fun. I was forced to the floor just like you see in these fucking videos on social media, two cops on my back putting me in handcuffs. I left the scene feelings hurt, body hurt, and bruised all over my torso. For a gay male to not be able to go out and enjoy himself and reap repercussions for having fun I just question a lot now. I should never have experienced any of this last night. And I never should have left a club looking like this bc of patrons working there and for mfs that are supposedly here to protect us. Police really aren't shit after what they did to me, and school of Rock is not going to be happy after they deal with me bc this isn't over. These scratches and bruises are only going to get worse.

These guys always make me feel good when I see them. And they aren't shy and they know how to make guess feel at home! Thanks guys the store was very clean and my sub was amazing as always this store is very consistence. If you want a recommendation on a great cold sub try the Italian/number13 mikes way or if your feeling like a hot meal any of the cheesesteaks are BOMB!

This is the only store that sells bus cards on this corner but I go at least 4times a week and they never have bus card for sell.    Review update      Just left ampm on alma school and baseline tonight it's around 1am I get off of work late to get my tobacco from there most nights, and I'm ther almost everyday befor work. But today when I arrived the cashier was smoking and talking to his friend with his back facing me. I waited for his attention then once I got his attention after 3 min and half of his cigarette is gone I asked him if he was ready. He then asked me if I was so I responded yea! He then told me he wasn't to just go inside and wait as I held the door open for him. I told him customer service is everything and he responded with customer service isn't everything. So I looked at his like the stupid employee he was and then told him never mind I'll ship somewhere else. He ran up behind me and followed me out the door screaming at me leave then I told u to wait two second but he never told me that. If he would have I would have waited, but what I got from him was in not ready and basiclly that he waited to finish his cigarette and conversation . After that he told me to leave and began to call me fagots because of my sexual preference and pulled a knife out on me. I didn't call the cops cause I was going to press charges but I need someone to call me about this matter I was assaulted the first time out of two years going there. If this matter isn't Handed I'll be forced to contact my lawyer cause I've never been the type to enter into someone's company and start prombles .    He had no name badge but I did notice arlease 7  cameras .

Really good place but a little to much in price for my medicine but I'd recommend them anytime. The meds are extremely well so the price point are actually correct  i just believe the area the dispensary is in it should call for less money.

Food was great but I only go to filiberto!! If you want real authentic Mexican carne Assad this is your place not the other bertos ! The I Normally go to the one in Mesa where the horchata is a little sweeter but this place is a lot closer to me and the carne Assad is off the chain an must try!

So this is my 2nd time here at hot n juicy mills...and once at westgate. I have to say I love it. Very affordable, clean , and the staff is very friendly. It kinda sucked our server had to relocate her section, which wasn't too bad cause it seem like everyone was helping out. Only suggestion I would have is HNJ need to make sure they are leaving at least 1 bucket to discard waste from shell fishy the table. We had to ask for that and we only received one bucket being a table of 6 . I also went to the one out in west phoenix they had amazing service as well. If I had to choose between the two I'll drive to west phoenix location in westgate.   My recommendation to customers get the drool...you'll enjoy it I would say that feed 2. Sauce u want is HNJ side of butter and a beer. Wink wink. The snow crab us phenomenon and the calamari is to die for. Why your at it try the black mussels they hold the HNJ flavors just as well as the potatoes and corn. YOU'LL LOVE IT.

I came in the other day and wasn't sure on what I wanted to eat because I recently stopped eating meat...originally I was thinking the sweet potato fries would be good, but wasn't gonna feel me up. Then all of a sudden I see the  Black Bean Burger, and noticed it was vegetarian. The customer service was great the store was Clean and even better the food was great. The Sweet Potato Fries Were Perfect And The Buger was amazing as well. I would recommend this place to everyone.
