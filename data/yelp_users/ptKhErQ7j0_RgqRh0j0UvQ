Being from Las Cruces, NM which is about 30 minutes away from the Green Chile capitol of the world (Hatch New Mexico), I think that I can accurately judge the green chile burritos to be sensational. I'm not much of a pork fan, (excluding bacon of course) which is usually what is in the burritos, so I usually just order a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style with green sauce. Green is the only way to go in my opinion. The burritos are huge, and are filled with so much beans, cheese, and green enchilada sauce, it's overflowing as soon as you take the first bite. It's always hot because they make each order fresh, but be prepared to wait especially if you go between 11-1. I try to only go after 1, but it's not uncommon to wait 20 minutes even going after the lunch rush. So if you have only an hour lunch, and you work downtown, you better be a speedy driver. I usually only have about ten minutes to eat after driving over and waiting in line, so that's definitely something to take into consideration.  It's a little hard to find at first because there isn't a sign, and the business operates out of an old house across from a school, but you'll know you're in the right place when you see the line up of cars for a block. The staff is all very friendly, but there isn't a lot of waiting room inside, and there really isn't too much space outside to eat either, so it's more of a grab and go kind of restaurant, which I don't mind because I probably would not choose to stay and eat there either, but you're going there for the food not the experience.  The only other downside aside from the wait, and the lack of seating and cleanness, are that the green burritos are twice as much as the red ones because they are so popular. I personally think that this is ridiculous, but obviously everyone is still willing to pay for it. All in all it's a great little hole in the wall in downtown Phoenix, and a must try if you are craving some delicious green chile.

Ok so the food is fine, it's fast food breakfast food, not much to be expected. Every time I've gone the service has been very fast, I've never had to wait long for anything. BUT.... they are always out of something, and I don't go at weird times, the latest I've ever gone has been 11am, so I feel like they need to step it up with keeping things stocked. There has not been one time I've gone where they have had plain bagels, which I don't understand because that's the most common bagel, how do you run out? They have also been out of croissants, numerous other bagel flavors, and donuts. Seriously WTF!?? Maybe I just have bad luck with the days i choose to go, but I'm definitely going to start eating a different location, because it's absolutely ridiculous that they would be out of these things so early.

This place is AMAZING. The curry is anything but bland, which tends to happen at commercial or chain Thai places. That's not the case here, you can really taste all the different flavors and spices in the curry. It's so good that I could have it with just rice. I have gotten the red, green, and yellow. Out of the three the green has been my favorite, but it's not for the faint at heart. I love the heat so I always order it hot. If you can't handle spicey the yellow is the way to go. The restaurant is very comfortable and cool on the inside, it's a nice place to go for lunch to beat the heat. They always play good music too, which is nice when you just want to chill out. The staff is also very friendly, and the service is super fast, I've never waited long than 10 minutes for anything, and that's even a stretch for time.

A lot of my friends from Glendale go to this bar frequently so when I was in town this last weekend I decided I would tag along. I do understand that it is a dive bar so I'm not basing my opinion on how nice the place was, it is mainly to do with the service. First of all the bar tender was decent, but I was there on a Monday night so obviously there weren't that many people and it felt like I was waiting a lot longer than I should have to get my drink, this was the case with all of my friends. It took equally as long to pay her, because immediately after serving our drinks she went onto other customers so we had to wait another ten minutes to either pay or set up a tab. I don't mind waiting, but when the bar is this empty I don't feel like it should take 15 minutes or more to get just one drink taken care of. She also gave my boyfriend the wrong debit card back when he closed his tab even though we told her his name three times. I am usually excepting of honest mistakes like that, but once again there were very few people at the bar and it was only us who were closing out so it just seemed to be more of a case of carelessness and not paying attention. Luckily they still had his card with no charges on it the next day.  Next, I had no idea that there were waitresses, but apparently there were 3 or 4, but not once did they come to our tables to check on our drinks or take away the empty ones. When I actually figured out who they were it was obvious that they were only taking care of one group (probably their friends) and were more concerned with playing darts and karaoke than their job. I just don't understand the point of having waitresses if they don't come around to every table at least once.  Last, we were there on Karaoke night and the DJ was probably the worst Karaoke DJ. There was a contest going on, but he didn't really announce it so there was only about 4 participants, who were all coincidentally the group of people that the waitresses were hanging out with. So it felt like no one else had a chance to participate at all which kind of defeats the purpose of Karaoke night if the same four people are singing the whole night. So correct me if I'm wrong but if only four people are singing then the contest shouldn't take that long, at least not the whole night (which it did), so literally no one else got a chance to sing, and again the waitresses got to sing whenever they wanted. When none of the participants were singing the DJ just played really awful slow songs instead of letting anyone else take a turn.   The only good things were that there were a lot of dart boards, and the space was very open so even if there were a lot of people it wouldn't be crammed. My drinks were also pretty strong too. Clearly don't go on Karaoke night, and don't expect the waitresses to do any work.

When you are in Vegas eating out is a chance to have a one of a kind experience, which is why my mom, brother, and I chose this place when walking through Caesar's Palace. Well, clearly we should have kept walking. The service was not good, I don't think our waiter smiled once during the entire meal, and didn't offer any suggestions, and it took a for him forever to even come over and take our drink orders when we first arrived. Come to think of it the service was slow the whole night.  I won't complain about my meal because out of the three it was by far the best. I got the fish and chips and it was really good, and a huge serving. There were three cod fillets and a large helping of fries. The tarter sauce was probably the best I've ever had. That being said my mom ordered the scallops, and the presentation was awful. They brought it out in a large bowl probably three sizes too big for the amount of food that was in it. There were only five scallops sitting in a broth with carrots. No presentation at all, and for the price of that meal with absolutely no side included it was far from worth it.  My brother ordered the lamb burger and fries, and his serving of fries was about half as much as I got, which was a little confusing. The burger had too many flavors that did not mesh well together. The menu selection didn't offer enough choices in terms of meat, there was only once chicken dish. The drink menu was pretty good, but they were all pretty pricey, and for the amount of wine my mom got in her first glass it was not worth the price at all, I think it counted as "half a glass of wine" so it should have been half the price.  The interior was very nice and very "British." Our chairs were arm chairs that you would normally think of for a restaurant but they were very comfortable and made waiting for our food relaxing. All in all I wouldn't go back or recommend it to anyone, there are so many better places to eat on the strip.

There's lots of options, so it makes for great combinations for something new every time. The food is fresh and delicious, and the service is quick and friendly. If you are looking for something new, quick, and inexpensive this is the place to go.
