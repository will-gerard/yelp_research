I love these little diner style places!  I would always rather give my business to a local than a corporation.  I stopped in here last night and grabbed a Fiesta Burger with cheese.  It's a big burger with 2 grilled green chilis!  OMG! This is not 1st date food!  Burger juice and ketchup dripping off your chin and running down your elbow is not attractive unless you're into the whole 9 1/2 weeks thing....  I didn't order anything else, because I didn't want to have that miserable "Thanksgiving full" feeling, but it all looked great.  They were dropping fries, spinning shakes, and had a variety of tempting pies in the display window.  Great food.  Great price!  Love that you can get breakfast anytime, too!  Oh yeah!  They'll now let you use a debit card for a $.50 fee.  No more worries about not having cash.

I was wound up like a little girl all day waiting and waiting to go to our 8:20pm showing of Polar Express in 3D at the IMAX.  I had seen the movie when it came out and loved it.  I'm pretty much a sucker for anything Tom Hanks does.  I knew it was a great movie, but I was on pins and needles waiting to see it with my hubby.  It was his first time to see the magic of the movie or a one in 3D at an IMAX.  The magic was washed away as soon as I stepped into the holding area to the theatre.  It was a dreary, depressing, uncomfortable place to wait until the theatre doors were ready.  I saw that there was popcorn, MY FAVORITE PART OF A MOVIE, but it I wasn't hit with the scent of seduction when I walked in.  To me, that means old, cold popcorn.  Grrr.  After our tickets were taken, we made our way through the filthy hall to our seats.  Oh yeah- they are assigned.  What's up with that?  Luckily, there weren't many people so we sat where we wanted without a problem.  The seats were stained with God knows what, arm rests were broken, seats were broken.  It was disgusting.  I have been in multiple IMAX theaters in Florida and they have all been pristine!  Where, exactly, is my $15.00 going?  The sound is amazing, the screen is awesome and 3D is incredible.  That's the only thing they've got going for them.  After I left, I was thrilled with the movie but I felt like I needed to have a lice screening.

My father in law is coming to town this fall and is ga-ga for aviation so when I heard about this joint, I had to give it a test run.  I went in for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon and there were just a few open parking spaces.  I am not one to think of a place as being worthy just because of it's traffic.  (Think Olive Garden).    I was seated at a table between a group of flight wives and a group of hard working men in cowboy hats, quite a diverse set of guests, I think.  My waitress promptly brought my menu and returned just as fast with my water.    I poured over the menu trying to decide...I'm horrible at restaurants and I didn't have my husband beside me to hurry me along.  I decided that the true way to judge a restaurant like this one was to order a burger.  I ordered Rick's special with fries.   My meal was served quickly and as soon as it was ready.  No heat lamps here!  My fries were good, not great because I like mine more on the crispy brown side than the pale tan side but they can't read my mind.  The burger!!! Wow!  It came on a fresh, soft french roll with two patties (I didn't notice that in the description otherwise guilt wouldn't have let me order it!)  The patties had white and yellow American cheese on it, lettuce, tomato, sweet onion, and a special sauce similar to McD's.  I normally would have given 1/2 of my burger to my hubby, but alas, I had no one to share it with and so I just HAD to finish it.  :)  My bill was $7 and change plus tip for this glorious find.  I can't wait to bring my friends and family here when it is cooler so that we can sit outside and watch the planes take off and land...that is if I can take my eyes off my meal!  (I didn't notice that high chairs were available...if you need one, I'd call to check)

We should have know better to expect a decent burger from a place that had maybe 8 tables full on a Friday night.    I seriously believe that McDonald's puts more beef in their burgers.  The service was almost non-existent despite the fact that there were more than enough staff for the limited numbers of patrons.  We ordered also ordered a basket of 1/2 onion rings, 1/2 french fries since the burgers come with NOTHING.  They were what saved the meal from being a complete wash.  Don't waste your time or money.

Stopped here tonight on a whim and quite happy about it, but the wallet's much lighter.  Hubby had: The Spotted Donkey "Chop" Salad A tableside presentation of chopped romaine, roasted corn, cucumber, blue cheese, cilantro, warm smoked bacon and avocado all tossed together with jalapeno buttermilk dressing, crispy flour tortillas $12.50  It was really good, the flour tortillas was my favorite part of the meal!  They toss it for you at the table.  *Big Ol' Jack Ass Angus Burger  with double cheddar cheese, grilled sweet onion, avocado, jalapenos and horseradish mustard. Served with housemade fries $12.50   Wonderful!  The fries were fresh and hot with the skin on.  The burger was fat and cooked perfectly.  The bun was not bought at Sam's Club!  Warm Flourless Chocolate Fudge Cake with Roasted Coconut and Raspberry Sauce  $9.00  We've had flourless chocolate cakes before and love them, but this one took us for a spin- it had grill marks on it!  Unusual and delicious!  I had:  Watercress Jicama, Orange and Avocado Salad with toasted pumpkin seed vinaigrette $11.00  Nice and fresh, but $11 bones is a lot for this girly salad.  Arizona "Mac and Cheese" Rigatoni pasta with hatch green chile, Mexican cheeses and applewood smoked bacon $12.50  If you like the mac & cheese from Z Tejas, you will love this!  Very rich, but a little too simple for a main dish.  Get this and share another dish with your date and you'll be happy.  Fried Banana Wraps with Mexican Chocolate Sauce with whipped cream  $9.00  Nice presentation, perfectly ripened bananas in nice flour tortilla and fried.  I had cinnamon ice cream with it but was envious of my hubby's vanilla and that NEVER happens!  Beautiful setting, nice place for out of town guests!

Yeah! We finally have found a place with delicious, creative sushi!  It's just too bad that it's 30 minutes from my home.   Hubby and I sat at the bar and was warmly greeted by one of the sushi chefs, Alan.   I love sitting at the bar so that I can watch the swift knife skills of the chefs.  This was my favorite experience of all time because Alan educated us on the different type of rolls he was making, the types of fish and their descriptions, and even how to select a good avocado at the grocery!  I usually have a difficult time conversing with the chefs because of their accents, but Alan spoke perfect English to us and Japanese to his co-workers.  This is the place to go when you are not in a hurry.  You are here to dine and enjoy the food and each other.  If you have a movie to catch, don't order a bunch of rolls, you'll miss the previews I'm sure.  It was not a busy night and Alan had to ask the waitress three times to fill our water glasses.  Never good.  The sushi rolls on special were a bit more expensive than I'm used to, but it's Scottsdale, but it's in a strip mall... The food is worth the wait.  Order the Alan roll for something fresh and different.   Enjoy!

Yikes!  This place was not what I expected after reviewing the previous Yelps.  My mom and I went there for the lunch buffet for $9.99.  Perhaps that was the mistake?  The buffet runs until 2:00 and we arrived around 1:00.  We should have turned around and left immediately when we noted only four people in the entire restaurant.  The food on the line was obviously the same stuff they put out at 11am.  The pad thai was forgettable which is what I had my mouth set on and the chicken panang had no chicken that I could find.  The wonton salad was good except for the limp, soggy, saturated wonton strips....so- I guess just the salad was good.  The chicken wings were great except there were only a couple of lonely wings to sample and they were not refilled even when a few new brave people straggled in.    The service was near non-existant.  It was their lunch time too, I guess because they were all sitting in a booth off to the side eating.  We received our drinks when we were seated, and after that only once more when we asked when they finally provided the bill.  We used another non-bussed table to put our used dishes on after realizing that they were more than happy to let the dirty dishes sit on our table during our meal.    I don't know, maybe it's worth going there for dinner?  I won't be finding out.

I am not the mani-pedi girl that I would love to be.  I am envious of the girls in my BodyFlow class who have perfectly painted piggies every day.  So...when I do finally have a REASON to get one, I want it to live up to it's reputation.  The salon I go to does not do nails so they recommended Njoy Nails to me for when my girlfriend's from college were coming out for a long overdue visit.  I stopped by a week in advance to see if they had availability for all three of us together on a Thursday. No problem!  Thursday comes and its the busiest I have ever seen the shop.  I go to Basha's next door it seems every other day.  We look around and there ARE three chairs available for pedicures but they are all spread out.  Ohhh, they forgot that we wanted to be together.  Luckily, there were some very nice women who changed their seats so that we could chit chat together.  C'mon, it's been 5 years since we've seen each other!  So, they sit us all down together and a tech comes over and starts to work on me.  Great, but my girlfriends are just sitting there.  No water, nothing.  After a few minutes pass, I ask if they are going to get their own tech.  We are told yes.  About 10 minutes pass before my friend on the left gets a girl and 15 before my friend on the right gets help.  This is ridiculous!    There are three levels of pedicures and we all choose the middle level which is supposed to have a longer massage and callous removal included.  The massage was half hearted and not satisfying at all.  I must admit that my feet were wonderfully soft and my polish is still in strong competition with the gym girl's after 3 weeks.  Despite that, I don't know if I'll return.  If I want to pay almost $40, I'll go to a salon instead of a nail place.

I am in love with Joe's FG!  I think that it is probably a little more of an emotion pull than anything else.  My hubby and I almost bought a house in Agritopia, the neighboring subdivision.  I had dreams of riding a cute turquoise Vespa with my little dog in the basket to Joe's, the coffee shop, and Cosmo dog park.  It is SO Pleasantville slash Edward Scissorhand's neighborhood and I love it!    We have been there many times and always bring out of town and new to town visitors here.   It's always a great story and people love that a lot of  the food comes from the farm.  Where else can you go that there's a TV in the bathroom showing some strange vintage video cartoon?  My favorite thing on the entire menu is the garlic fries!  They are a must but make sure that EVERYONE in your party at least tries them if they are going to be in close quarters to you for the next several hours.  This is especially true if you are going to be driving together!!  Everything else on the menu is great!  Love all the burgers, the pizzas are good, my hubby loves the beet salad, the portabella mushroom sandwich is flavorful and satisfying and if you have a sweet tooth, make sure to try the french toast, peanut butter, banana, chocolate chip, pineapple, strawberry sandwich!!! After that, don't forget your shot of insulin!  The ice cream is okay...I'm more of a hand scoop ice cream fan. I haven't had the shake but whenever I go, it seems like everyone else is having one.  I prefer to walk next door to the picture perfect coffee shop to get a special bakery treat.  Take your friends, take your kids.  Don't go for peace and quiet.  This is not a romantic can't see your meal it's so dark restaurant.  You go for the atmosphere, you go for the food!

This place drives me crazy in a good way.  The other night I went there for the second time.  Luckily, it was late and they were pretty slow so I was able to pour over the extensive menu at my leisure.  It also helped that I was with my mom who gave me this horrible trait of indecisiveness.  When I'm with my husband, he scans the menu titles and picks one.  I have to read every description and then narrow it down little by little until the waiter or waitress comes and I am forced to make a snap decision.    My mom was interested in the appetizers but since I had been here once before, I was able to talk her out of it.  All I had to do was remind her of the glorious desserts that were displayed when you first walked in.  Mom ordered the chicken fried steak and I ordered some mushroomy chicken delight!  It was served with mashed red potatoes, my fav, and I substituted parmesean zucchini spears for the roasted veggies and a biscuit the size of my fist!  We both agreed that the food was wonderful but saved 3/4 of it for the next day's meals and order dessert.  Ahhh, dessert!!!  The last time I was here, my hubby and I ordered the ice cream cookie sandwich and we couldn't get close to finishing it.  We almost cried as cookies are sacred!  This time, I ordered "The World's Smallest Ice Cream Sundae" which is a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream slathered with thick hot fudge and a mountain of whipped cream.  I ordered the chocolate chip toffee cookie on the side expecting just a cookie.  No, they brought the cookie out which is almost the size of the plate drizzled with carmel and chocolate.  I ate the ice cream and a few bites of cookie and brought the rest of the cookie home.  My mom ordered the creme brullee trio.  One was traditional, the other was something I can't remember and the BEST was the expresso chocolate!  Incredible!  Don't waste your time, money, or calories on the trio...just get the mocha!!  If you are a coffee freak, have a paramedic standing at your side for CPR...you'll have died and gone to heaven.  I will also support Kristin C's review:  bring your own Tupperware!

Lucky for my hubby and I, the first New Mexican restaurant that we were going to go to was closed so we ended up at Blue Adobe.  The previous Yelpers warned me not to worry about the neighborhood and exterior of the building so we didn't and proceeded.  It was a wonderfully clean and smelled intoxicating!  I ordered the green chile chicken corn chowder and the lobster tamale and portabella mushroom enchilada with an amaretto mushroom cream sauce.  The corn chowder was fantastic!  It was presented beautifully and was delicious.  Okay, enough of that...let me say that I can't imagine ever ordering anything but that mushroom enchilada again!!!  The mushrooms were perfectly sauteed in butter and the amaretto sauce is something I never would have dreamed up.  Incredible!  My husband ordered the Red Chile Pork Posole soup and a combo platter that had a bunch of different stuff on it that I couldn't pay any attention to.  I was too full even before finishing my own meal.  He did say that it was really good and would come back again.  Oh yeah, the Peach sangria was the strongest sangria I've ever had.  It had peach schnapps in it...a lot!  Well worth $7.00.

I was very sad when Carden's initial owners closed shop but very happy to announce that there is now NEW OWNERSHIP!  Hubby and I stopped in yesterday after a workout when we were pleased to see the Open sign lit up once again and even happier to see the FREE cup of coffee sign out front.  We went in to get a cuppa joe and were enticed by the wonderful scents of fresh baked goods and coffee.  The cafe looks the same but there's a different menu. (Still carrying Boar's Head products.)  I love how comfortable this little gem is.  There's a reading area with comfy couches around a flat screen tv and fireplace. I think that they even have free WiFI!   We purchased a cinnamon crunch bagel and a whole wheat bagel and got our two free coffees.  I am not a coffee connisseur, but my husband is and he loved it!  I usually have more milk than coffee in mine.  I could tell that it was a bold coffee, hot and fresh.  The bagels!!!! Wow, I've never had bagels so fresh!  We moved here to AZ where I haven't found a replacement for my favorite Panera Bread cinnamon crunch bagel until NOW!  The top wasn't piled high with sugar and cinnamon but who needs that anyway? It did have a bit, though.    I will be back this week for lunch and to buy a loaf of bread.  They sell several different types.  I'm going to try the spelt first.   Don't let Carden's close again- go now!  PS- Closed on Mondays!!

Go to Sweet Republic this week and say, "I support Bake for Hope," and they will donate a portion of their proceeds to Bake for Hope.  Bake for Hope is a charity that is raising breast cancer awareness and providing proceeds of nationwide bake sales to local Susan G Komen for the Cure affiliate offices.  On this Saturday, Bake for Hope will be there to sell our delicious homemade cupcakes, brownies, and cookies.  It is the PERFECT pairing- cake and ice cream!

If you've read my previous post about Aunt Lena's Creamery closing, you know that I was fretting about where to find Twinkie gelato.  No more worries!  We went to Gelato Fantastico not long ago and met the owner.  She was very personable and enthusiastic.  After talking to my friends, she decided to make TWINKIE gelato and even named it after my friend!  VERY cool!   We sampled multiple flavors and had difficulty making up our minds- they were all delicious and no ice crystals to be found!   I'm always happy to see peanut butter and of course, Diamond's Twinkie Deluxe!  I'll be back to try more flavors!

Ohh! I love this place!  I originally bought my first bottle of strawberry balsamic vinegar as a gift to my hubby, I have never been a fan of vinegars.  It ended up that I was the one pulling it out of the pantry time after time!  I could drink that stuff!  I returned quickly just before Christmas to purchase more for my husband and I and also some for gifts as well.    Go for the strawberry and red apple vinegars!  Make a stop on your way home for some $$$ vanilla ice cream and strawberries.  When you get home, pour the strawberry balsamic over the ice cream, strawberries and if you're really wanting something special, have it with some pound cake and whipped cream.  Dessert fit for royalty!    The olive oils are fine, I just prefer to go to The Queen Creek Olive Mill for fresh, local olive oil.  Enjoy!

Thankfully, the yelp hours of operation was wrong.  They are open on Sundays.    We were seated and greeted by our server promptly. They easily accommodated the changes to my order and our food was brought out before we knew it.  As always, the food was plentiful and delicious. Our server did a great job keeping our drinks full and offered to-go cups.    Get the hummus! It's so smooth and flavorful, you will crave it.

I was so amped up for this event and when I arrived, I was immediately unplugged. This was my first encounter with Glendale's Chocolate Affair and my expectations were set WAAAAY too high.  Where are the elaborate chocolate displays and demonstrations? Where are the artisians? The enthusiasts? The chocoholics?  All I saw were ridiculous lines of people waiting to pay too much for your basic fair food in which some of it was dipped in chocolate. BFD.  Maybe it was the best chocolate covered cheesecake on a stick ever, but I will never know because I'm not waiting any longer than 15 minutes to find out.   Next time, I'm just going to head down the Central Phoenix Farmer's Market where I can give my money to local folks who are passionate about their craft and are fantastic at what they do. (Bite Me Brownies,  Wei of Chocolate, etc.) I won't have to wait in line longer than It's a Small World at Disney for some crappy apple dipped in chocolate.   Thankfully, we didn't bring the dogs as they would've been trampled and I feel sorry for the people who had their little ones in strollers because they were like salmons swimming upstream.  I overheard one dad say that he had had enough.  He was taking the stroller back to the car and just carry the baby.   On a positive note, the entertainers were good for the time I was there and I found the little area shops charming.

Ellie's is a little Mom and Pop place on the SW corner of Gilbert & Queen Creek.  Ellie is a Native American and her husband is Mexican so, together they have Native Mexican.    They specialize in Indian Frybread and offer catering.  When you go to Ellie's, it's for the food and not the ambience.  It's set up reminds me of a Subway shop, but who cares?!  So it might not be a place to bring your fiance's parents when you meet them the first time...  There's a little cart with fresh, warm tortillas and a fresh salsa bar so you can have a little something while you wait for your made to order meal.  I remember the first time I went there and Ellie gave me tortillas HOT out of the fryer.  Incredible!  There are 6 different salsas to choose from and they are all fresh.  I can't get away from ordering the Steak and Green Chile burrito, but one day- I'll venture to something else- like maybe Steak and Green Chile on a frybread?  :)  Go check this little place out!  I would cry if they fold and I just can't eat all 3 meals a day there, even if it is inexpensive and they are open for breakfast.

I think Ellie read my review.  The place is a little more spiffed up.  I still don't care I love their food so much!  We've had the Green Chili and Steak on FRY BREAD!!!! OMG!!  This thing is incredible!!  We also have tried the shredded beef burrito.  They are huge and delicious.  We ordered the guac and we could hear the cook mixing it up right after our order!  That's what I'm talking about!  Also, the chips and salsa bar (complimentary) make it so worth while to eat in!  The chip are in a little machine that reminds me of a popcorn machine to keep them warm and there's several fresh salsas to choose from that are kept in a covered refrigerated station.  It's nice not to have to fight the flies like at other salsa stations! ;)  I told you before, I'll tell you again! GO to ELLIE'S!!!  While you're there, stop next door to Carden's Cafe  & Bakery under new ownership for a sweet treat afterwards!

I have been absolutely spoiled by Dr. Glenn, Dr. Schmidt, and their staff. They provided loving and comprehensive care to my dogs and cats the 7 years I lived in Phoenix. Now that I've moved to Ohio, I cannot find a veterinarian who compares to the Life Care Animal team.   When I first moved to Chandler, right across the street, I didn't know a soul. My husband was traveling and I had the emotional burden of lying my sweet cat to rest. The staff provided such touching empathy and kindness I fell in love with them instantly.   My dogs were always happy to go to the office as they were treated like royalty! Even after my little Brussels Griffon had to have double knee surgery, she was happy to return. Her surgery was a great success and the follow up physical therapy was so helpful for her recovery. Not only are Dr.  Glenn and Dr. Schmidt wonderful vets, they have great resources.   Save your time, look no further for someone to provide excellent care to your four legged children. Tell them Brandy and Itsy sent you!

Wow, what a bargain! Delicious dinner buffet for only $10 and that includes a hot spicy tea and mango lassi. Great service and clean. My only suggestion would to move the rice to the beginning of the buffet so that stupid Americans don't double back in line.
