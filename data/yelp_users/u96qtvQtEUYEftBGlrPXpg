Best sushi in the west valley.  The smoked salmon and baked lobster rolls are insanely good.

Being on a diet, I decided to try their skinnylicious menu.  All items on that menu are under 590 calories.  I tried the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp, served with angel hair pasta and asparagus.  It was wonderful.  There were 6 large shrimp cooked to perfection, the pasta and lemon garlic sauce was very good, not overpowering at all.  I was skeptical at first because when many restaurants try to create a diet friendly menu they almost always forget to keep the food with taste.  Not the case here, this was well done.  This was definitely helpful to my diet at mealtime, especially since I blew it having the pineapple upside down cheesecake for dessert.  Come one, who can go to the cheesecake factory and not have a piece of cheesecake.

The atmosphere is really nice, but that is it.  Our server took forever, I don't know if she had to many tables, but service was very slow.  The food was very bland and overall tasteless.  There are so many better alternatives in the Phoenix area, don't waste your time here.

The food is great, we live close by and we have gone here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Everything we have ordered has been very good and a great value.  Especially the breakfast burritos.  Service is good and they have your food ready pretty quick, which is impressive considering they always seem to be busy.

Excellent food at a good price.  Great value for family dinner.  The Kung po is excellent, along with the fried rice and potstickers.  Service is excellent as well.

The food here is fantastic and the service is friendly and attentive.   The crab cakes are amazing, they use a good amount of crab and they are cooked to perfection.  The fish tacos are huge and taste great, they are battered just right so they are not to doughy and you can taste the fish.  They have a wide variety menu and everything we have had so far tastes great.

I like that this location has late hours and offers 90 minute massages on a consistent basis.  I have been going here for a number of years now and have 2 to 3 therapists that I really like.  I had to try a number of different ones when the therapist I used most went to another location.  They have had a few that are not quite up to the level of the others I use most, but it is not the norm.

Dr. White and his staff are awesome.  He has looked after all of our dogs with great care and compassion.  You are given an estimate of costs up front so there are no surprises.  He is careful to help your pet get the best possible care, without emptying your wallet.  The online scheduling of appointments is a very convenient tool, as well as the e-mail reminders of annual or upcoming wellness checks.  You and your pet will be very happy with the quality of care received here.

Went in to purchase some carne asada ranchera, while talking to the butcher I told him this was for my daughter's birthday.  He then went in the meat locker and brought out a fresh piece of beef and then fresh cut the whole order.  He put the meat and marinade in a bag so everything would be ready to go to the grill.  Grilled up the meat and it was great.  Also bought some fresh chorizo, that he just finished making.  It was excellent as well.  The place was clean and all food looked well prepared and stored.  Service was excellent and the people working were very friendly.  I would definitely recommend this place to people looking for fresh Mexican style meats.

This place is small, but the quality of the food is excellent.  You get much more for your money, especially compared to the competitors close by.  The smoked salmon is out of this world and the sauce on their baked lobster roll is as good as it gets.

We went the other night and was not impressed.  We noticed all new faces and after a little digging we found out that it is now under new ownership.  For the most part the sushi was still pretty good, the baked lobster roll was not up to the standard of past visits.  But what stood out the most was the poor service.  I don't know if it is due to all new people or if they are new to the restaurant business in general, but food service was slow, they forgot to put in the order for the kids, it just seemed very unorganized.  We will probably give them another try, but they do have some ground to make up.  Definitely not the fans we were before.

The location is very clean and pretty easy to get in an out of.  My one gripe with this station is that they post a price on the street which is a cash or shell credit card price.  So when you start pumping your fuel, you then notice that you may be paying $0.10/gallon more than what is on the sign.  Then you look at the sign again and see in very small letters cash or shell credit card.  For someone with a diesel vehicle that is a big price difference especially when there are places not far away, where you can get cheaper fuel.

Dr. Cooper and his team are the best family dentist office I have ever been to.  This coming from a person that has spent a good amount of time in the dentist chair, due to braces.  Our entire family goes there now and everyone is very happy with the care they receive. They have always worked up a quote after checking with my insurance, so I know exactly what the services will cost.  Which is good for a family on a tight budget.  They have taken into account the costs for us, especially knowing that there are months where four of us may be there in that one month. My favorite thing Dr. Cooper does, that most dentists don't do much, is that he tells you exactly what he is doing while he does it.  In many cases they have a small camera and show you on the monitor where they need to work, why and then the after shots of what they have done.

I was skeptical when my wife suggested this place, because I really didn't like the last greek place we visited.  This place is very good, especially the traditional beef & lamb gyro.  The people are really nice and helpful, the service is good.

Went for lunch, was not disappointed.  The sushi was very good, place was clean, service was very good and we did not have to wait a long time for our meal.  We will definitely be going back.  One of the other reviews said best kept sushi secret in town, we totally agree.
