A few months ago I went into this gym to inquire about a membership for my family and me, but what happened next was so shocking. I walked in and was asked for an ID. I explained to the young girl at the counter that I just want to speak with someone regarding a membership. She called a young boy to the front who would only identify himself as Jeff. He too asked to see my ID. I asked why he needed to see an ID, he said it was "company policy". He showed absolutely no interest in selling me a membership, or even showing the facility to me. I then expressed disbelief that the company would request an ID from someone just for expressing an interest in joining the health club , and asked to see a manager to which "Jeff" replied "well, I'm it. I asked him "are you guys really interested in selling memberships?". At which time this young boy said, to me, "I'm going to have to ask you to leave" I complied, retreated to my Porsche, parked in the parking lot and called the corporate office in California and spoke to a woman who answered the phone. She advised that She would have someone return my call. I have since called and left 3 subsequent messages, and 11 months later no one has called. I'm not the kind of person to claim racism, however, I know for a fact that this gym doesn't request identification from non- blacks who  walk in to inquire about club membership at their facility. Does this happen to every black man who walks in their doors? Hmmm?

So I was on my way to The Good Egg at Hilton Village as I have for awhile for breakfast, then I saw the sign, "Jacqueline's Cafe". I got curious (because I used to eat at a Jacqueline's Cafe on Indian School in Old Town years ago) and I went in. Alas! It was the same Jacqueline's. I absolutely had to try the breakfast. The truth be told, everything on the menu looked so good i have to go back to try other stuff. Anyway, the food was even better than the old Jacqueline's, and that is not an easy accomplishment. The prices are more than reasonable, the servers are all pleasant and I was greeted with a BIG smile from the girl at the front, sorry I didn't get her name, but everyone there was pleasant and attentive. I will definitely be back.

I'm not a big fan of Mesa, however, because of work, I'm there often. I was racing back toward Phoenix/Scottsdale where I could get some late lunch when I saw a young girl holding a sign which read "Large Pizza $3.99. I stopped in, thinking "what do I have to lose", expecting the worst, and hoping for something just edible. I really was blown away by the pizza, the place is super clean and nice (not what I expected for those prices).  I consider myself a pizza snob, having traveled as much as I have, lived in Southern Italy where the pizza is REALLY good.  I now find myself eating at Robby Bobby's 4 or 5 times per week, so far I've had their burgers, subs, and lasagna, no complaints here.  These guys keep surprising me. Yesterday I saw something there that I NEVER expected, Greek fries. Are you kidding me? They had Greek fries, I was in Greece 2 months ago. I ordered some, they were awesome!!  I understand this place just recently opened, and I sincerely wish you guys at Robby Bobby's the best. You guys have a good thing going, good food, nice people, and a really nice looking establishment, probably the nicest, and cleanest restaurant in the area.  Keep up the good work, and i wish you all the best.  Good Luck!!!

I have an account with this bank and had a need to call their customer service department, and I encountered the RUDEST, most unhelpful, non-caring people of any organization I've ever encountered. I then asked to speak with a supervisor, and got from her more of the same. I will be closing my account and taking my business elsewhere. Stay away from these AHs.

I was driving home from Tempe tonight when I saw this place so I decided to stop in and get a bite to eat. The first thing I noticed was that the place was super clean, friendly staff, but most of all, awesome food. I had a ribeye steak sandwich, which by the way was only 7 dollars and some change, fries, and onion rings. I can find a good steak sandwich almost anywhere in the valley, but this one was one if the best I've had. I was a huge fan if onion rings, but these changed my mind.  Anyway, I give these guys 4 stars, can't give 5 yet until I have a chance to try the burger.

I'm no food critic, but I do know a good burger when I taste one. About a week or so I stopped in here and I wrote about the steak sandwich, this evening I decided to stop again but this time I had a burger and fries. The burger was awesome. I don't like to give five stars, but I gave four for the steak sandwich, so I think they deserve five. The people are friendly, they came over to my table for friendly banter, and to see if I liked the burger. Even though I was in a hurry, just wanted to eat and leave, it was a welcomed change from the norm.
