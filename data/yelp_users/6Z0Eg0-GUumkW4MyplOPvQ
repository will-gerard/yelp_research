Yay found a burger place nearby that hits the spot!  Went to check out this place because we had heard good things about it and just wanted a good burger. This location was relatively small and at the end of a strip mall. The menu is pretty basic with burgers, hot dogs, sides, and shakes. I ordered a double ranch burger (aka hamburger with mayo) and added mushrooms and Swiss cheese. I also ordered cheese fries, because I am a sucker for anything covered in nacho cheese sauce.  The bf ordered the chipotle burger (burger with chipotle mayo) and added bacon, of course. We spent about $16 for the both of us. The burgers were very tasty and had that grilled flavor to it.  Food is simple but definitely gets the job done if you want a good burger and fries. We will be back for sure!

:( So sad about my two-star rating... This used to be one of my favorites spots to eat. They have delicious Korean BBQ and they offer combination meals that include about 6-8 sizzling plates that is shareable for a big group. Service was quick and always accommodated us. But slowly things went downhill; they started cutting down on portion sizes and charging for extra things, like substitutions and RICE! Recently they have expanded to next door and added a sushi bar and karaoke rooms. I have yet to try either of those, but my suggestion would be to soundproof those karaoke rooms! Diners in the restaurant can hear it all, good or bad :X Guess I'll need to start looking for a new KBBQ place around Phoenix to get my fix!

This is one of my usual happy hour spots when I need a good drink and some good food. Came tonight expecting their $2.95 small bites menu and found a brand new HH menu :/ the prices are a bit higher but some portions are bigger than before. I ordered two strawberry mojitos (Yum! One of the few places that carries Cruzan Strawberry Rum) and toasted Ravioli. The BF got a Keylime mojito, a Manhattan (aka Bourbon on the rocks, or that's how it tasted lol) and the Brio Burger. Food and drinks were great and service was quick since we sat at the bar. Only downside was the higher prices - our bill came out to around $36 for happy hour - for two apps and four drinks....might not seem so bad, but I think we were just used to the old menu and prices. Oh well that's Scottsdale for you! :)

I was pretty disappointed at the selection of items for the price. The buffet costs $21.99 for adults, which is pretty pricey for an AZ buffet.  The restaurant is an old Claimjumper location with uncomfortable chairs. The sushi selection they had was pretty good and much better than the usual options at a Chinese buffet. There was sashimi, nigiri, and plenty of specialty rolls to choose from. Besides from the sushi, they only had about two rows of hot food to choose from. Pretty much the usual Chinese dishes that are offered at buffets. They also had crab legs and oysters (which my friend said was pretty good). So overall the food was OK, I was just expecting more for what I paid. I probably will not come back, I'll save my money for when I go to Vegas and want a real buffet.

Steak 44 was amazing! Went here last night for our anniversary and everything from the food to the customer service was so awesome. Since they knew it was a special occasion, they sat us at one of the booths with the view into the kitchen. Our server was so friendly and attentive (not overly so) and the food came out really quickly. We ate the following: Parmesan rolls, crispy shrimp appetizer, bone-in filet mignon with truffle butter and a side of scallops, bone-in ribeye, corn creme brûlée, Mac and cheese, and shisito peppers. Everything was delicious and the steaks were still sizzling when they got to our table, and cooked perfectly. They gave us a complimentary dessert to end our meal too! It is definitely on the pricey side, but reasonable for a steakhouse of that quality. Totally worth it! Can't wait to go back for another special occasion :)

Had high hopes for this place, since it's a branch off of Fresh Wasabi in Glendale (which has great food). Went here for Happy hour and got seated right away. We ordered from the HH menu - two Raspberry Teas (their version of a Long Island with raspberry flavor), calamari, and four sushi rolls.   Calamari was chewy and had no flavor, teas were a little weird but strong and effective, and rolls were small and mostly consisted of rice. Oh, and they left the cream cheese out of our Philly Roll! That was a first for us.   All in all, we were pretty disappointed with Sushi Style, and would probably not come back :/

Finally got to try this place out after bookmarking it months ago! It was pretty crowded when we got there, but it was a Friday night. We waited in line for about 10 minutes and waited another 5 for a table. We ordered the Ahi Tower, Harumi roll, Rainbow roll, and Philly. The Ahi Tower was delicious!! It was big enough to share. A bit on the spicy side bc of the spicy tuna but sooo good! The Harumi roll was great too (shrimp tempura inside with tuna on top). All of the sushi was very fresh and we got our food pretty quick. We told one of the sushi chefs that it was our first time there and he gave us some complimentary Mochi ice cream to finish our meal :) Harumi sushi is definitely one of the good sushi spots in AZ!

I can officially say that Harumi Sushi is my favorite sushi spot in the Valley!!! Great food and even better service/hospitality. Love Juno, he's the best :) We have become somewhat regulars at Harumi and would probably go every week if it was closer to us.  The "Oh My God" roll is a must try for everyone...yum! Can't wait to go back for our next sushi fix :)
