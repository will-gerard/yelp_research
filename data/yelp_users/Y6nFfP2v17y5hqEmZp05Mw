Our weekly Empowerment meeting creates around lunch. It seems we are forever looking for a place that has good prices and a quiet place for us to brainstorm and raise our energy. We have stumbled upon Duck and Decanter.  Finding this restaurant is only half the battle, the other is where the heck the front door is. I felt I was intruding on the outside patrons, only to realize I had to meander through, taking a glimpse at what they were devouring to get to the front door, an added bonus I suppose.   Opening the front door to a happily buzzing place seemed like quite a treat. To your right is small wine area, to the left were barrels and stuff. A bit confusing, but basically it is like walking into a deli shop of olden days. I had no idea what I was doing. I stood in line and squinted at the barely visible menu of an array of deli meats, smoked meats, salads and more. Of course being gluten intolerant one can hope she has hit the conscious jackpot..but not today...I will just have the insides..no bun! But wait! I see smoked duck and wait..I can order the sandwich of my choice and have it made into a salad. Well that is a great compromise!   Of course to know me is to know I am gunna ask a lot of questions, my main concern, does the smoked duck use nitrites, nitrates or any of those other nasty carcinogens. Rather shocked by the question, the gentleman serving me has no idea and had no intentions of looking. Damn! I was really hoping for the duck!   I quickly go with plan B as I weigh nitrites or high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil..with that it was the tuna salad.   You can not pay for your meal in advance as the idea is to meander the store..so I did. there were barrels of tea and coffee ready to be ground at your request. I was not impressed with the coffee grinder on the floor-ewwww. There was also an espresso area but it was not operational.   There are gadgets to buy for your kitchen, and packaged condiments and foods that I presume they make fresh there. There are fountain drinks , bottled drinks, good assortment of water and non alcoholic beer, and loads of sugary add ons within tempting reach right at the cash register-brilliant! And there is not tempting this fort Knox (well the rice cripsy treats looked..nooo must...resist...  I get my food, pay and go up stairs. There are different levels and two places to sit outside, which makes this place even more interesting.   I open my package and there right on top are two pieces of bread stuck to my tuna. I read the entry for the Entree salad and it said nothing about adding in the bread. I ordered the salad due to the fact I can not tolerate gluten.   Too hungry to care, I peel off the bread and I dive into my food and I am shocked at how awful it is. What is that mushy stuff? I think it was water chestnuts in my tuna salad. Who puts water chestnuts, (if that was what it was) in their tuna salad?   I was unimpressed with the fact that the tuna salad was put on a bed of spring lettuce (which is a thumbs up for this nutritionist), some sliced celery and string cheese. Cheese?!? Who eats cheese with their tuna?   The tuna itself was extremely dry and too salty for my liking, and I had a tough time getting it down, and eventually I got so turned off I did not finish it. There was no dressing and no taste.  I ended up not eating the salad either. What a waste of  $10.00 including guilt tip! At least the company I was with was fantastic!   Some restaurants ask you if you have been to their establishment before so that they can have the opportunity to give you the best experience possible. I truly believe this is something Duck and Decanter could adopt. Maybe I was supposed to order dressing, I have no idea. Since I had never been there before and did not know what I was doing.   I did ask someone else about the ingredients and she took the time to look and confirmed my suspicions-sigh.   I can't wait until there is a conscious shift to what we are putting in our bodies and those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant can eat without anxiety!   Is this a place for those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant?  NO there is not enough awareness of ingredients, and handling of food.   Bathrooms? yes weird..outside of the building, but clean.   Would I return?  No but for the sake of my friends, which is way more important, I will and eat some where else first.

Firestone Cave Creek Road where everybody knows your name and they are always glad you came!!! CORNY I know! But, so fitting!  I am a stickler for good customer service and those that provide it I become extremely loyal to! Friendly, clean, precise, fast and honest; that is what I look for and that is what I get at this particular store (Believe me they are not all the same). I like the fact that I can make an appointment and they are able to stick to it and not keep me waiting. I am greeted every time with a "Hello how are you today? Nice to see you back." I have been coming to this store for over two years and I get the best service every time!  My last visit was over the top! My daughter left it to last minute to get her snow tires off and an oil change before heading to Mexico. They were swamped but not only squeezed us in but ended up having to stay open an extra hour and half to get her car done-wow, wow, wow! The reason why? The manager Mark Kowalski says "hey I have a daughter the same age and I know how much it means to you to keep her safe." This alone is enough for me to keep coming back for great customer service and personal care from people of integrity and honesty. Thank you to all of you!

One of my favourite places to go is Gluten Free Bakery Creations when I need an emotional fix or some comfort food. Today was no exception. I was in need of some maternal nuturance and doughnuts is the food of choice to satiate the desires. Of course a gluten free doughnut is no substitute for a hug, however my family is too far away and this is a quicker route.   The bakery is not the easiest place to find, in fact I usually pass it and it is on the way back that I find it. Look for a yellow building tucked behind Midas Muffler and the blue Mid-city Barber Shop. The front is not inviting, but once you open the door the wonderful smells mesmerize and put you into a complete trance.  There are a couple of freezers full of delectable tasty delights ranging from breads, bagels to cookies, pies cakes and mmmmmmmmm doughnuts! My favourites are the vanilla with white frosting and sprinkles. The down side is they are always frozen, the upside; I live in Arizona, a couple of minutes in my car and they are ready to be eaten! There is also a fresh made-that-day section, if you want that you need to go early as it sells out fast. They are open Mon-Fri 9-5  I gathered up my favourites, the doughnuts, the Everything Bagels and what's this? It can't be! Beef Pot Pie? I grew up eating pot pie and would case the grocery isles frequently putting my intentions out to the Universe for someone to come up with a gluten free piece of heaven and there it was! My prayers have been answered.   I got up this morning in excitement with Pot Pie on my mind. Two choices are to microwave (not!) or pop it into the oven at 350F for 30 minutes.   When the timer went off I was over come with excitement and yet a little fearful it would not live up to my childhood expectations. I carefully took a piece of the crust and it was like I was transformed back to my childhood listening to my father's Scottish rogues of child hood adventures. Wait is this gluten free? How can this be? The crust is so flaky and smooth that it almost melts in your mouth. I did not know it was possible to create a flaky pastry out of gluten free grains.  As my fork pierced into the middle there was a burst of beef, potatoes, peas and carrots. It was all so perfect.   I would have liked to have seen a little bit more beef, but that is the hunter-gatherer ancestry blood talking. I would love to see a larger version of this delight, and I am sure I could have one made to order. Over all it was worth the purchase and I will go back and get more.   Whether you are gluten free or need to accommodate a guest Glutenfreecreations.com is the place to go. They have an extensive list of creations, and they will also accommodate any dietary restrictions as well.   They are a certified dedicated gluten free facility, meaning they only deal with gluten free grains, which means you can trust there will never be an issue with cross contamination.   If you go here, please drop me a line and let me know what you think..especially if you have the doughnuts or pot pie!   Oh and by the way, if you are craving pie, stems from an urban-hermit, feeling lonely. Well Thanksgiving is around the corner, and I did go for doughnuts too right?

Wanting to get out from my home office and go for a walk with a destination in mind I headed for Organic Shores. Knowing this cafe is a blend of vegetarian cooked and raw food and to quel my panicked question "Where's the beef?" I ate some grass fed humanely raised steak at home just in case.   After my long walk I quenched my thirst with a freshly squeezed house made lime and apple juice and got a little confused when it came to me pink. I enquired on the colour and it was left over beet juice from the drink before.  Personally I feel it should be clean for each drink but hey at least it was organic. More concerning was the brown oxidation foam on top of my drink. Cute and creative but really? How could they not know this?   But I will admit it was as good as the fresh Limonada natural that I used to get living in Mexico.   I decided to play it safe and ordered the Nacho Supreme. Beautifully displayed and the site did not disappoint  my tastebuds. In fact it had such a meaty full fat mouth feel that I really did not miss the lack of meat (my blood type O apologies to the vegans and vegetarians reading this).   This dish was enough for two to share for sure.   What really drew me to this place besides the organic appeal was their raw deserts. As a sexy gluten intolerant girl It is not often I get to have my cake and eat it too.   They did not have all the options available on their desert menu but was happy to give the New York style dairy, soy and gluten free cheese cake a try. This too did not disappoint. I did not miss the dairy one bit.   The service was good however I felt rushed. I came to chill out and hang out with the love-of-my-life. Our server asked us twice before our meal was finished if we wanted desert. I finally said yes after the second  time just to get her to allow me my chill factor I was looking for. Maybe she got nervous seeing me tap away on my iPhone. It's all good.   The owner came over and asked how our food was but did not introduce himself. Sure wish he did so I could  stand up and hug this guy for putting an organic restaurant in my neck of the woods that I can walk to.   The menu is not extensive but has some great choices on it. There are a couple of grain options and once I get to know the owner I will teach them how to make a mean raw veggie wrap and chips and paleo crackers and abolish grains once and for all.   The atmosphere is welcoming and relaxing despite our over zealous yet courteous server. I really hope that this place catches on because we need more places like this.   What was interesting is the people who did come in after us where very conscientious about where the food was coming from to the point that one was upset they were serving bottled water.   You do not have to a be vegetarian, vegan, or a "woo-woo hipster" to enjoy the awesome flavorful dishes of Organic Shores.   This a great place to catch up on computer work (free wifi), meet with a potential client, or catch up with a friend.   To put this into perspective for my So Cal tribe this is on the same level as Cafe Gratitude.   I will be coming back for sure. There are many more dishes to try and so little time with my crazy hectic speaking schedule.   Thanks Organic Shores.
