http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUjpkXoiN-Y  Not only did it take 30 minutes to be seated, it took another 30 to get our drinks.  And an hour on top of that to get our food.  Once we got the food, we were interrupted by a server who had dropped a card in the slot between the table and the window.  Instead of reseating us, they actually made half of the dinner party stand around and wait for them to dig for about 20 minutes.  When the manager approached us after the fact, he offered us dessert.  We had our own cake because it was a going away party...so then he decided to offer us ice cream like that would solve the problem.  No thanks.  Oh wait, then he asked us if we wanted a candle...no...it's not a birthday and none of us are turning 1.  So then he ASKS if we want a discount.  Well, considering the fact we couldnt even enjoy the meal, one should have automatically been given.  No need to ask.  Horrible service.  Horrible experience.  At least I had an awesome group of people with me!!!!  I will never return to Kabuki.  Unacceptable.

Nothing like the California Islands. Worst service ever. The chili cheese fries were soggy and looked and tasted like they had been sitting in grease all day before being thrown into the broiler to heat them up...and had been saved all day to be disguised under chili. 20 min later I was finally able to say something to the server when she came back. No I don't want more. I waited another 20 for my 5 chicken tenders. Not to mention the iced tea was water.

Hands down some of the best donuts I've ever had...in my life. Always fresh, always tasty. I am honestly a donut snob...and 99% of donuts pale in comparison to Bosa. From taste to density to price to all around deliciousness. The only complaint I have is that they're often "out" of things.

I just got home from getting my eyebrows waxed by Ann Reed -- http://waxingbyann.com/  I was a first time client -- so I received my first eyebrow wax free of charge.  By the way, if you're a first time client she will do this for you, too!   ANN WAS AMAZING.  Not only is her location convenient and easy to find parking, her service room is adorable, welcoming, and clean.  The music she played was so relaxing and the wax she used felt amazing.  It didn't hurt AT ALL and was the perfect temperature.    Ann was very conversational, and made it feel like I had been going there for a while.  She took her time to make sure my eyebrows were perfect and let me tell you -- they are now!!   I have been getting my eyebrows waxed since I was 16.  My go-to place was in Flagstaff -- but my usual lady left on maternity leave about a year or two ago and ever since I have not been able to find someone good.  I was finally referred to Ann and now I'm wondering why the heck did it take this long to find her?! She's the best -- better than my go to in Flag was!!   For the first time ever I have the correct starting points, ending points, and angles to my eyebrows.  I never thought this would be possible to achieve without the addition of makeup.  Thank you Ann!!! And I highly recommend her to ANYONE!!!

Ugly Cakes Bakery's sweet treats are to die for.  I am a sucker for sweets...but not just any sweets.  I know what's good and what isn't.  The minute I tried the Carrot Cake I thought I died and went to heaven.  But it didn't end there.  Then I tried some cookies...and then some fudge...and 'tis the season for Pumpkin Rolls!!! I wanted to cry when I ran out.    Seriously -- not only are the treats amazing and baked with some major TLC, the souls behind the company are treasures themselves.  Awesome branding, awesome concepts, awesome food, awesome people.    Highly recommend them to anyone -- even if you dont think you like sweets, you'll like theirs.  I promise!!!!!!

Absolutely the only place I trust giving me a spray tan. Always comes out perfectly bronze, naturally tan, and radiant looking. The day after I leave seeing Donna at Arizona Airbrush my self image is x 1,000,000. I always feel great! Kind staff, professional, trusting, and very quick while still being thorough. Highly recommend this place to everyone...whether you are looking for a light tint or a deep tab...that's the best part about a custom airbrush tan!
