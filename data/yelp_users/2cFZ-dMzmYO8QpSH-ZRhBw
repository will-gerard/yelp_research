Amazing food, amazing service!! We come here at least once a week!   I highly recommend any fish they offer as a special.  They never disappoint! There is a perfect balance of sauce and sides-- Every time I order, I think how can they get better than the last time-- but they do!!!!! The grilled Cesar is awesome// if you've never had a grilled salad- try it here.

My favorite place.  I love sitting at the chefs counter talking to Christopher and Taylor and our meal is prepared to perfection.  Amanda is almost always our sever--she knows what we like and we always have fun conversation!!    But now the food- the duck two ways is amazing.  But the lobster in puff pastry is like nothing you've ever had. Imagine lobster  in a lobster brandy reduction topped with puff pastry ... You can drink the reduction sauce.   Deserts are all phenomenal, but the soufflé is a must.  Traditional soufflé - chocolate, vanilla, raspberry and grand mariner.  Happy hour is also a must! Later in the week it's crowded, but they met the needs of the demands and expanded the seating!! You can get half price wines-- and a happy hour menu that features the amazing red pepper soup topped with truffle oil, the pizzas, and an amazing salmon salad!! There's more too!!  And if you just want a bite-  there is the new small plates menu-the ribs are unbelievable!  Go and enjoy. You will be back!

Christopher and his A Team delivered 5 stars on New Years Eve!!  We chose the tasting menu to start the new year right!! Gary had the sweetbreads-- soft, tender and juicy with an amazing sauce-I had the smoked salmon with creme fraiche and a chive panne cotta topped with cavier...,amazing!! Second course-/ Gary had the lobster I rave about! I went outside of my normal box and got the chestnut soup with Fois Gras!!!  Wow!!the combination of taste and texture was something I will dream about!  Main courses were amazing as well! By this time we are stuffed!!! Did I mention the portions are extremely generous????? It was an amazing evening-- Happy New Year to all!!

I love this Pita Jungle!! Hayley and Eric at the bar offer great suggestions !!  And they are cool! Mark the manager- again cool! We had tapas- highly recommend the hummus trio, tomatoes and mozzarella and the pita with herbs- also has onions, olives and tomatoes-- I don't recommend the mussels! Non happy hour- tuna pita awesome!! Then lavosh -- get the house lavosh!! Veggies!! Omg!!  You can't go wrong- but the DR location  is the best!!

Ok- I can't even write a review on the food because the service was so bad!  We sat for 10 minutes and was not acknowledged/when we left,I said we were leaving because no one talked to us for over 10 minutes!! They replied,"have a nice night!"  OMG!

Best sushi ever!!! Amazing service and fun!! Eddie is so cool! Emo our server was great!  Honestly the best sushi and service in town!!!  You have the option of getting All You Can Eat... I highly recommend this!  It's like no other-- you have so many options and can create your own role or half roll. The sushi chefs will create special rolls too! They even have Kobe beef on the all you can eat!! Hip atmosphere too! In door out door seating!  I like sitting at the sushi bar outside.  Make sure you say hi to Eddie-- he is the owner and is usually in the trenches helping at the sushi bar.   By the friendliness of everyone who works there, you know Eddie treats them right!

Ok- though I don't live in the immediate area, I'm there every week!! I found my cool spot giving me quality me time, while my daughter is at soccer-right down the street and my son is at hockey practice.  Marc is always behind the bar!! He is engaging and will chat- it doesn't matter if there is one or a full bar and restaurant - you feel like the most important person!! Rebecca - the owner- omg!! She gets to know all who come in, but she is very unassuming ! I ( stupidly) asked her if she worked there, nicely she said she was the owner!!!! Amazing business woman and always remembers me when I come in! The atmosphere breeds conversation and friendship. You may go in thinking - a glass of wine and a little work - never happens. It's a glass of wine, or one of the specialty drinks-- and new friends. If you haven't been , go,.  Also coffee!!!!! Omg this would be my local coffee place!! Please don't go on Tuesday-- that's my day and I want my seat at the bar!!!!!

I love this hidden gem.   I started coming here when my mom went into an extended stay at JCL now Banner-- This is the deal..., amazing wine and food. Before i go into the food I have to say this is one of my favorite hangouts I met Marcus, server, he is by far my favorite person here!! My sis and I walk in and Marcus knows us by name!!!    Amy, Sarah, Enrique, and Nathan- who is a young thin Vince Vaughn are all fun, smart and a great reason to come!!   Food// my fav the smoked salmon platter.  A house smoked salmon fillet- with egg salad and a lemon vodka crime fraiche... Amazing on the best bread you will ever have.  Order extra bread.     The cheese plates and antipasto and huge and an amazing cornicopia of flavors!!!    All pizzas are wood fired-- amazing!! The Sunday breakfast items are all sooooo good!! All I can say is go!!!

This was my second time--  Ok first- the ambiance warm but there super cool vibe here. First time I ate inside with business colleagues. Second New Year's Eve on the patio. The patio with the lights and heaters made for an amazing NYE.  We started with the steak tartare .. OMG amazing with a romesco sauce and traditional but served with Crinkle cut French fries with a Harissa infused ketchup.  That spice was enough to elevate these fries to another level! Ask for extra toast points when you order. We also started with the baked Robiola -a burst of flavor with the crispy artichoke and pistachio! Robiola is like an Italian Brie- not as strong though.  Dinner was the small plate of gnocchi with lobster in a broth scented with truffle oil- giant pieces of Maine lobster. Amazing.  The special was the rack of lamb.  A large 4 bone rack that melted in your mouth!!! It should be a regular item on the menu.   An amazing place with great food, ambiance and service. It won't disappoint!!
