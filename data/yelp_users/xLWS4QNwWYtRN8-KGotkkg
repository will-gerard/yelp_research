My favorite Mexican food! I always order  a machaca potato and extra cheese burro. The cheese quesadillas and tortillas are delicious too. I like to wash it down with some of their horchata. I am not a fan of eating at the restaurant as it's a little ghetto but it is very clean. I recommend calling in the order since it gets really busy sometimes.

I went for a yearly check up and apparently, you are not allowed to ask questions. If you ask any questions they charge extra (in my case,over $300!), which of course was not communicated to me at the time. Now my appointment that should have been covered by insurance I'm having to pay a sizeable amount out of pocket. When I called the billing office to find out why I was charged the extra fee I was told they charge the extra fee if you need a prescription for birth control too. Having been to a gyno for 16 years I've never been charged for asking questions or needing a birth control script. The visit with the doctor itself was nothing special, the doctor was mildly friendly tho somewhat frazzled. It was also a bit odd that they do not have a front desk, just assistants with tablets who sit in the waiting area and approach you as you enter to check you in.  I had previously gone to the Maricopa office and had NO problems. I will not be returning.

We ordered take-out some original pizza muffins, fettuccine alfredo, and baked manicotti. All were delicious! The alfredo sauce was rich and creamy. The pizza muffins were a hit with my son who normally doesn't like pizza. We will definitely eat here again.

The service was so bad, we never even got to order. The waitress asked for our order after about 5 minutes but we weren't quite ready and she never came back despite our attempts to get her attention. 20 minutes later we left and as soon as we were out the door she was cleaning up our table. We will not be back.

I've been here several times and LOVE the Baby Lobster Roll. I've eaten a lot of sushi in my day having lived in Seattle and really enjoy this place. It's small and pretty quiet too. I've always had good service.

We've taken both of our cars here for service. One they did a diagnostic and found it needed to go somewhere for the transmission. They didn't charge us and referred us to a place in Phoenix that did a good job and was very affordable. Our other car they did an extensive diagnostic on and gave it a tune up and some other things. The car had been out of commission for two years and they got it working really well and for a reasonable price. We'll definitely be going to them in the future. They were really nice and seem really honest.

I had them come out because some of our outlets weren't working. Preston came out right away and fixed the issue in about 2 minutes and didn't charge a dime. Honesty and integrity like that is why they keep getting these high ratings. I will definitely use them in the future.

Wow, very impressed! The bagels are fresh and the cream cheese is delicious. They were so sweet to my 4 year old son. They invited him back to watch how the bagels and gave him a mini dough bagel to play with. He had a blast! We will definitely be coming back.  Blueberry bagels with strawberry icing are a definite win for my kiddo as well.

I have gone to this location several times and have had no problems. I went in today because my last oil change was in August or so and they told me my oil was still good and I didn't need to change it just yet. They also topped off my wiper fluid and looked my car over while I was there. Any other place would have probably just taken my money and sent me on my way so I truly appreciate their honesty. I will definitely be back.

Went and tried the jade chicken in a burrito and a carnitas quesadilla, black beans and rice. My favorite thing here was actually the snickerdoodle cookie they serve with the meal. The carnitas were dry and the jade chicken tasted funky in a burrito. I tried it without the tortilla and it was OK but several bites had gristle. The beans were good. The tables were all dirty though the place wasn't crowded. I tried the plum dipping sauce and it really didn't work with anything on my plate so I'm not sure what it's intended for. I think that this is a good concept (Mexican/Asian fusion) but poor execution.

Great food and relaxed atmosphere. I had a sampler plate and my favorite was probably the pulled pork and the ribs. The mac and cheese is possibly the best I've ever tasted! We will definitely be back but maybe to get takeout because the line to get in can get long.

The food here is very good. I've loved nearly everything I've tried. I will say that I only ever get take out. The restaurant itself is really small and often packed. If you are in the mood for a pasty though this will hit the spot.

Went today for Taco Tuesday and got 2 tacos, rice and beans for $6. My son got a free nino quesadilla which was nice. The chile beef and sweet pork are both very good. The rice and beans were flavorful. My favorite thing was the fresh tortilla it's on, so good! The restaurant was crowded but the line moved quickly and there were clean tables available. I can't speak to customer service as we had no problems but we will definitely be back for the food.

My husband got hit by someone and the car got slammed into the curb. We went to Brighton because of all the good reviews and I'm glad we did. They were very professional and have impressive customer service. They took care of everything for us from the rental to getting the car's mechanical work done as well as body work. The car looks brand new where it was hit and they gave us a warranty and explained all the repairs. Heaven forbid I'm in an accident I will definitely go back.

Went to this urgent care in January as I had cut my finger badly. They couldn't do anything but said.. while you are here lets put on new bandaid. Received a bill in March for $175 of which $70 was for the 2 bandaids they put on my finger (which I didn't even ask for or need!).   Called to dispute the charges in March and was told not to worry my insurance would be paying a portion. Then get an email notice a few days ago (July) that insurance paid their portion and now I owe the rest and they charged my card on file without giving me an amount and did not have an amount available on their website. Surprise!  I called yesterday and was told definitively that the charge would be reversed and I could set up a payment plan instead. I also wanted to dispute the amount charged and was told that they would speak to a manager and get back to me.   After not receiving a follow up call, I called today and spoke to the manager who said they would NOT reverse the charges as promised and they would not do anything further but send a receipt. All this after being promised a reversal an payment plan yesterday!  To pour more salt into the would (pun intended) the billing manager was extremely patronizing and callous.   Never EVER going to this chain of Urgent Care's again, they do not keep to their word!

On 7/15 I asked to speak to management as was told the manager was given my contact info and would be in touch likely by the end of the day. After no call I emailed 7/17 and was told the lady had my info and to lookout for her call. It's now 7/29 and I never received the call.

Urgent Care Extra told me yesterday they didn't have a payment my insurance had stated they had made in July which should have created a credit on my account. I was again treated rudely and despite explaining multiple times that my insurance paid incorrectly and issued an incorrect card to me initially, the lady at Urgent Care Extra erroneously "corrected" me on what my insurance benefits were. It took me issuing a grievance with my insurance to get this resolved and amazingly there was a credit on my account! They have no idea what they are doing in that billing office!

I love this place! They don't have it on the menu any more but one of my favorite things you can still order is Mediterranean style calamari. The gator appetizer has the best sauce too. My favorite experience there was when they had a live jazz band playing. It's very noisy and crowded and usually you have to wait for a table but it's SO worth it if you like seafood.

I would be shocked if I don't get food poisoning after what I ate today. I took one bite of a fresh spring roll and it was obvious the meat was rancid. Never going there again!!

We've gotten take out from here several times and really enjoy it. The gyros are really good and so are the fries. I got a cheese pita for my kid and I think I'll order it for myself some time because whatever cheese they use is delicious. Normally I'm not a fan of chicken gyros but theirs is delicious. They seasoned the chicken really well. We will definitely keep coming back!

I love this place! It is the best Indian food I've ever had. My husband had tried Indian food before several times and was not a fan but after purchasing a Groupon he agreed to try The Dhaba and absolutely loved it. It is a smaller restaurant with very cute décor and a relaxing atmosphere. I recommend putting in a reservation, especially if you go on the weekend. Some of our favorites are the Rehriwale dahi bhalle, Kashmiri Chicken Tikka Masala, and Lamb Curry. The fresh naan and rice are amazing. The service is a little slow sometimes but the food is always stellar.

I'm thoroughly addicted to their garlic green beans. The sauce they are in is just the best. I haven't had anything bad here. The lemongrass chicken meat was a little dry but seems like it is that way wherever I order it. Pad thai, Bún Ch Giò Tôm Tht Nng (B2), and spring rolls are all amazing too. One thing that sets Pho Chandler apart from many other Vietnamese restaurants I've tried is the quality. They have the quality of a good chain restaurant so I wouldn't be surprised if they become one.

We went here craving Mexican food. I'll start off by saying I had no problems with the parking lot but the place seemed pretty dirty (ie. door, tables).  They started cleaning while we waited for our food but they dumped a bunch of windex or something right outside the door to get in so we had to either jump over it or walk through it on the way out. Not the most appetizing thing to smell while you wait for your food. We tried the enchiladas, cheese quesadilla, and carne asada burrito. The burrito meat was really unappetizing...my husband only took a couple bites and decided to forgo it. The cheese enchiladas were okay, nothing special. The rice was good but the beans smelled and tasted funny to me (maybe they are just more authentic Mexican than I'm used to, idk). The cheese quesadilla was on the greasy side but tasted good. I think I will pass on Morenos in the future unless it's to try the sonoran dog.

Love this place! All of the food is good but some of my favorites are the gold wings and bollo pasta and of course pizooki  (sure I'm spelling it wrong!). Service is always excellent. The only thing I've had that I wasn't a fan of was a sandwich because I didn't like the bread. Kid friendly too, they give kids a ball of dough to play with. The atmosphere is sort of loud and fun.

Made a reservation for Christmas Eve via Open Table. We have not eaten here before... show up and the place is closed and was too late to make reservations elsewhere. Not sure what happened but very disappointed and inconvenienced. Also had seen on FB where they told someone else they'd be open Christmas Eve. We will not be back.

The food here is simply amazing. My favorite was the bruschetta with fig jam, apple and brie but everything I ate was phenomenal. The wait to get a table was long but they keep you as comfy as possible with misters and serving drinks. I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu!

Went to try this place based on a friends recommendation. We had honey habanero (bone-in) and ALT boneless wings and honey biscuits. The wings were really good. Not the best I've ever eaten in my life but still very good and we will definitely come back again. The honey biscuits are like big greek loukoumades. Definitely not what I had pictured in my mind when I ordered them but it was a pleasant surprise. A friend ordered the cheese fries and said they were also very good. Only dinged one star because we called in the order and were told 10 minutes, didn't show up till about 15 minutes after I called and still had to wait 5-10 minutes for the food. The lighting is kind of weird (all neon red) so I recommend ordering take out unless you fancy everything looking red when you eat. :)

Not sure why this place got such high ratings. I love pan fried noodles so we ordered Chicken Cantonese Chow Mein. The chicken was slimy and the veggies were obviously past their prime, the sauce tasted bottled. We also had crab puffs which were good but I didn't see any crab and the dipping sauce also seemed bottled and goopy. I much prefer the chicken pan fried noodles and pot stickers from C-fu. We will not be back.

Yum! The salad here is amazing! I am not a huge beer drinker but we loved the Bitterrecognize. The service was fast and our waitress was excellent. This is a great place for a drink and the food is equally delicious. I love the ambiance with beautiful pictures and camping stuff. We will definitely be back!

My favorite thing about this place is the atmosphere. The lighting is nice and the birds and checker boards are fun.  The parking is pretty conveniently located across the street. The food was outstanding. We had the bacon/cheddar burger and The Wall Street salad. The service was the reason I did not give this place 5 stars. One of the drinks we ordered never came and it took quite a while for our food to come, though the waitress was nice. That said, it's a beautiful place to sit and relax and enjoy music and a drink or game while you wait.

My son got his haircut at EMG and just loved it. The stylist went easy on him and made him feel very comfortable. Glad we decided to check it out. We'll definitely be back.
