This place is super funny and fun!  Devil's Martini North is one of the best places I have found for a great happy hour and even greater people watching.  This place has two for one amazing martini's (I LOVE a great martini) on Thursday nights from four to six p.m. There have quite a great selection from the straight dirty martini to the Godiva Chocolate martini to the Bananas Foster martini and everything in between. The outside seating is comfy couches, but get there early 'cause they fill up fast. The crowd is pretty diverse.  You have the young 20 somethings, normal people in their 30's and others.  The best are the 40 to 50 something recently divorced North Scottsdale Cougars in their Dolce and Gabbana Jeans and their ultra high Jimmy Choo heels!  It is hilarious to watch them get more and more liquored up and teeter back and forth as they flirt with the bus boys and get more and more confused on who is a customer and who is an employee.  It would be hard to confuse the two as the staff wears black Devil's Martini t-shirts, and the customers have to abide by a dress code (no flip flops kids).  It's a great scene to watch!  There are also free yummy hor'ordeurves as well on Thursday nights.  Go for the martinis and get hooked on the people watching.  This place is fun!  Although, I may find it fun for all the "wrong" reasons.  Ha ha!  Seriously, though, check it out!

Who would have thought the most amazing mexican food would come from inside a Shell gas station?  Seriously, it is so good.  I used to go to this place i North Hollywood that was family run, and had the most amazing food.  I missed it so much, and here it is again!  This is the cleanest gas station I have ever been to. The restaurant is against one wall, and offers tables and table service as well.  The carne asada is to die for.  And, for those who love it (I am not quite that brave) they serve menudo on Saturdays now, as well as Sundays.  What other gas station has been on "Diners, Drive-ins,  and Dives'" Yummy!

Being a snotty coffee loving snot snot I wasn't expecting much from Dunkin" Donuts.  But, they just got done with their facelift and grand re-opening here is Arizona, and its close to work, so I wanted to give them a try.  I have to say I see why they are Starbuck's #1 competition on the east coast.  The store was clean and well organized.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  I ordered the flatbread gilled cheese combo for lunch which comes with iced tea or lemonade.  I got the iced tea, and it was delicious.  My grilled flatbread had three cheeses, and was fast, and warm, and very tasty.  This is not what I was expecting, and they have a great operation running here.  I WILL be back!  Oh, and my donut with pink strawberry frosting was delicious as well!

Dude, this is the best Mexican food I have ever had!  This cute, family owned restaurant redefines Mexican food. Take everything you enjoyed about your favorite restaurant, and upgrade it to full scale gourmet, but unpretentious and casually fun!  The staff is all fantastic. The food is AMAZING. t is simple, but beautifully displayed, and the best sauces ever!  They have a full bar, and their margaritas divine.  Plus the bar and outdoor seating with the misters is super great. I cannot say enough good things about this place.  You will not be disappointed.

Forget Macayos Mexican Food!  (I hope you already did) Forget what you knew about Tex Mex or other Mexican restaurants, or wannabes!  Take everything you love about Mexican food and make it gourmet with fabulous presentation, and place it just past downtown Scottsdale.  Los Sombreros is hip and fun with a great bar, wonderful tequila, and a nice outside seating area combined with some of best food I have tasted.  I have thoroughly enjoyed myself each time I have been here, and I will always go back.  Everything I have tried has been excellent.  The staff is friendly, and the restaurant is family owned.  This place is always busy, so there may be a bit of a wait, but I swear it will always be worth it!

Wow, there seems to be some negativity about The Bungalow lately.  I have to say I have always had an excellent experience here, and this is one of my favorite restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.  I love the happy hour specials and the bartenders make a dang good dirty martini, and the best cosmopolitan I have had.  I love the Kobe Hamburger, and the strawberry salad and filet mignon steak salads are to die for!  No matter what I have  ordered it has been great.  I bring friends here all the time, and we always have a great time.  Be sure to ask for Tawna.  She is the best person there!  Don't hate!  Appreciate the Bungalow!

I had a great time at Julia's UYE here!  I was not sure what to expect, and I had a really good time.  I was not impressed by the restaurant however.  The place in funky and fun, and I really liked the eclectic decor.  The people are very friendly, and the food was tasty.  I had a great soup that I enjoyed very much. HOWEVER, I feel that the staff took advantage of our entire group.  Two people ordered small appetizers in which the staff took the opportunity to turn into multiple, small, $25 appetizer plates. We were not expecting this, and it inflated our bill dramatically.  I would say there was a little bit of a language barrier between us, but the staff certainly was able to flatly say they had explained it to us.  I feel we were  treated rudely, and our bill was deliberately inflated as no one else was in the restaurant.  The food was good, but certainly not worth the price, and although I will forgive many breaks of service, when it is done deliberately, I will not go back.  All in all I had a wonderful time with the group (thank you all!!!!), but I will not return here on my own.

Wow, I am surprised at the last review.  I have found the food at Bada Boom Pasta Room to be excellent every time I have been there.  I am in love with Mr. Pink's Pasta. It has a delightful vodka sauce, and you can also add proscuitto wrapped shrimp as well. They have a fantastic martini selection a well, and the decor it hip and fun.  Did anyone say red velvet walls?  Great place!

I love this restaurant!  The hummus with pine nuts and with chicken (or without) is to die for!  I love hummus, and this is so good!  I have also eaten their schwarma pits (fried garbonzo beans in a pita) which is equally delicious.  Yum!  I have also had a small lunch pizza with spinach, pesto, goat cheese, and tomatos. Yum! All in all this place has great food, and In have always had great service, and delicious food. It is very fun and consistent.  I will always go back!

This is one of my favorite restaurants!  It is funky and fun with a great casual decor, and a friendly staff that does not turn over. They even remembered me when I was not able to go for six months!  They knew my drink, my usual seat, and what I usually ordered.   Tuesdays offers Tappas and $5 Patron margaritas!  Breakfast is amazing, and dinner is as well.  But, come anytime.  You will LOVE this place!  Can I say anything more amazing about this place?   I had a grilled salmon with buffalo sauce the other evening.  It was deelish!  I had wondered if it would be too weird,  but it sounded sooo good, and it was!  The salmon and buffalo flavors blended perfectly.  Yummy!  The owner even bought me a drink, because I try to get everyone I know to this fabulous place.  I LOVE it!

"One, two Feddys coming for you!" "Three, four better lock your door!" "Five, six pick up a crucifix!" "Seven, eight better stay up late!" "Nine, ten if Freddy Kruger went to Lush he'd have had great skin!"  Dude, this place is AMAZING! All of their products are all natural, freshly made without preservatives, and are just incredible.  My best friend and  went here after a four martini lunch plus shopping, and we had a had treatment done with their Ocean Salt Cleaner and exfoliator.  It is made with sea salt and smells just like a margarita!  his was followed by using their dream cream, and now I am hooked!  And it's not just the martinis!  I have very sensitive skin, and I have never had a reaction.  They also have a great men's line as well.  I have been using the Ambrosia Shaving Cream for men as well on my face, and I have no razor burn.  It is like a light cream that moisturizes while I shave.  Wow!  I have never felt good after a shave!  Anyway, I could gush all day about this place, but the bottom line is it has incredible products that are all natural, and many are vegan,  the staff is amazingly helpful and not at all phony, and even though it may seem expensive the products last for a long time, so the cost is really not that high.  Get thee to Lush!

Um, yeah, no!  Not!  I love coffee houses, but if one is going to go with corporate coffee I would rather hit my local Starbucks that The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.  "Simply the best?"  That is their motto, but I think not!  The artificial power they use in their drinks tastes nasty, and never fully disolves in either the hot drinks or the iced drinks.  There is always a nasty, sludgy mess in the bottom.  Plus the powder sticks in my throat and makes me cough.  And none of the employees know anything about the drinks.  They seen very disinterested.  If I am going to buy coffee I want it to be from a fun place.  If I want coffee with morning attitude I can make it at home, and experience by own bad attitude. This Coffee Bean has been a bad experience every time.  Hit the independent coffee houses, or hit the Coffee Beans older, and successful brother, Starbucks.  Why settle for second rate coffee?

Well, I wanted to try these, but the line was always around the block with soccer moms with strollers and kids, so I didn't.  I pulled in the other day just 'cause there was no line, and I was passing by.  I ordered the Red Velvet cupcake for me and my amigo.  It came to $7.02 for the two.  But, it was the most moist and delicious cupcake I have had.  I wanted to buy enough for the next month, and just chow down for them and try to look like Jabba the Hut!  I didn't.  It was expensive.  But, MAN OH MAN, that was one DELICIOUS cupcake!

Wow!  Are there no reviews of this place, yet?  Okay, this is a funky, fun concept for a restaurant.  First of all I need to let you all know the food is great, although one might not want to eat it every day.  The menu fits on one business card, so the choices are simple. Nothing is diet at all, and the french fires are fired in lard.  BUT, the food is soooo good.  The concept is cute too.  The cooks are dressed as doctors, and the waitresses are dressed as nurses a la Tim Curry as he was dressed in the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  It sounds weird, but I recommend everyone who loves a great burger try the Heart Attack Grill in Phoenix.  Get thee there!  Yum!

I have to admit I am very, very picky about who cuts my hair.  When I moved to Scottsdale from Los Angeles my biggest worry was who was going to cut my hair!  I know most people worry about where they will live, or where they will be working.  No, my worry was my hair.  Well, I did try several of the very expensive salons in Scottsdale, but my haircut kept getting more emo and worse every time.  A friend of mine took me to see her new hairdresser at an Aveda salon. And a long story short...I now go to Changes to see Tasha every couple of weeks.  She has cut my hair perfectly.  I have not had someone cut my hair this well in many years! I have always had a great experience here.  She is the cutest, most amazing thing around! The staff is always very friendly, and I have to say they even recognize my voice on the phone now before I say my name.  The salon is trendy and cute, but without being pretentious.  And the stylists that work there have a great rapport, and always help each other out.  I would seriously recommend trying this salon. I could not be not been happier!  AHHHH-MAZING!
