This place is amazing! Location is easy to get to and valet is Perfect! It's free and I didn't mind paying a few bucks for the convenience! The food is great! Came here for a brunch with some girlfriends on a Saturday morning! They were willing to give us a nice comfy couch area for our group of 6-7. We all got mimosas and our server offered to just grab us a bottle since it would be the same price ($5/each). Yum! I had looked up reviews before going and was all about ordering the bruschetta but my friends were feeling the brunch items. Everything looked so tasty! I ordered the prosciutto and Brie panini and chips. Oh my gosh soooo very flavorful!!! It was in the sweet side due to the fig but so many flavor profiles in each bite! I can't wait to come again. I hear they have deals on Monday and Tuesday nights for wine and bruschetta!

Ehh! It's ok! The decor in the place is awesome! The walls are covered with anything and everything Chicago, obviously. The food wasn't that great :/ heard good reviews about the place and just wasn't "wowed". I ordered the sliders which the lady at the counter recommended as a favorite. She also told me to order more than one since there was just a 1 ounce hamburger patty on each. Didn't taste any better than McDonald's, to be honest. The friend I was with ordered some type of polish dog, I think, which he said was good. The fries looked good but I can't say I've ever complained about a fried potato.

This is one of our favorite places to go!!! We had a great time yesterday, now that the weather is cooling down! I bought the $10 pack of tickets which gets you 12. With $10 bucks we were able to ride the train 3 times and the carousel 3 times. The carousel is a little faster than most. Definitely hold on to your child since they aren't strapped in. The train ride is a great length and goes through a nice green park! There are tons of picnic tables and trees for shade. Will make a day of it and bring our lunch next time!

Perfect! Staff was friendly and offered samples! Loved the new sesame honey chicken. This location has the soy sauce out for your convenience. Some can be stingy about that. Food was hot and fresh. Delicious dinner tonight!

Love this place!!! Breakfast is always a hearty meal when you dine here. Yesterday, I went to pick up the famous Jack Daniels Pecan Pie for our Thanksgiving meal! I look forward to this every year! The pickup process is always very organized and convenient! Staff is very friendly on this busy day! The pies from Rock springs are a must try!!!

Coolest coffee shop I've been to in Phoenix so far! Definitely not your average coffee shop! They have an extensive menu with lots of fresh and local products they cool with. The menu changes daily too which is so much fun. This place is close to school so I can see myself spending lots if days studying on their comfy couches. Their long wooden dining table was perfect for us nursing students to spread out million books out on! My iced skinny caramel latte tasted like it was full of cals and goodness! The coffee beans they use are sooo much more tasty than Starbucks! There's also a bar on one side. We saw oranges being squeezed into champagne and the drink menu was something special! Will have to test it out in a day I don't have my nose in my books! Brain has to rest, right?! This is one of those hard to describe places, so you must indulge for yourself! Most definitely a place to try!

Ok; I've been wanting Thai for a very long time! Had a favorite restaurant I went to while pregnant in California. First Thai food experience in AZ...eh! My first bite of the pad Thai with most of the Yelp reviews had pictures of was just ok! My first bite I took of shrimp was exciting...until I realized that would be my ONLY bite of shrimp! One? Really? That's not the Thai food experience I'm used to. The flavor is great! I also ordered chili eggplant that came with chicken and rice! It tastes good. I am just left with disappointment in knowing my shrimp is gone and I didn't get my Thai food fix :(

I am absolutely disappointed in something I expect to be Great!!!! I live so close by and remembered the appearance of their great pastry case...Ya, tonight was HORRIBLE for a dessert lover! My "Cheesecake Factory holiday vanilla" cupcake was an embarrassment!!!!!! That cupcake may have been "fresh" or fresh frozen a week ago but holy moly! The frosting is stuck to position! Could smash it and it would look the same! The frosting is my favorite but I decided to look into the cake since the frosting was subpar...could not Even pull it out of the wrapper. The top layer was a rock! How terrible! I was excited about this find but disappointed to have even paid $2.50! Ughhhhh I sure to plan to use this place as a relaxing afternoon of grazing magazines with a sweet treat! Bummer!

Let me just start out by saying, this is NOT the review I would like to be writing. I'll admit, this is not my first time here but it certainly will be my last. I live basically hop, skip, and a jump away and this would be way too convenient for my ultimate craving (which, yes, happens daily ;) I stopped in for dinner around 7:30 and there is one cheese pizza sitting under the lamp for god knows how long. From a previous trip I remember there being about 6-7 specialty pizzas ready to take a slice and be on your way. Specialty pizzas are my thing. You would NEVER, I repeat NEVER, catch me ordering a cheese or even pepperoni pizza. There is just way more to life than to be plain Jane like that! So the dull toned lady tells me that it's $2.50/slice and an additional $0.50/topping. I should have to just politely said no thank you but I was set on pizza for dinner so I ordered chicken, spinach and mushrooms which the man takes the cheese slice that had been under the lamp for unsaid amount of time, adds the topping and puts in back in the oven. I will eat pizza hot, cold, reheated, etc but to have my pizza cooked a second time as I'm ordering it is just not my idea of deliciousness! So if I cant finish it, I am then triple heating my pizza?!? No thank you! Customer service was not there. Reheated, over priced pizza. Like I said, I really wanted to like, or love, this place but that's just not the case. I guess I'll be heading to the grocery store for a whole frozen pizza for about the same price and about 100000x more satisfaction! Sigh!

The whole experience was perfect!!! Was here last Sunday morning for brunch and was so thrilled with the choice in location for our get together. The staff was great! Our server was very friendly and patient with our party of 15. The server decided to split up the order which was a fantastic idea. The food for the other side came out right after she had even finished taking our order. Love when food is quick but not at the burden of the quality of food. This was not at all the case. The restaurant was pretty empty but we did not have to wait long for our food. Typically it's a waiting game when you have a large group. I ordered the breakfast panini which was delicious! I've actually been craving it ever since I was there. The panini had egg, mozzarella, tomato and spinach on it. The bread was fresh and the potato wedges were to die for!!! I was told to try their pesto sauce and fell in love. Dipping my sandwich was exactly what I needed! The mimosas were tasty! Wished that the Bellini would have been on special also but that wasn't a problem! Mimosas did the job! They had a live band playing at brunch. He was very talented and the level of sound was not too loud for us girls to chat! I will be coming back to this restaurant because there are so many delicious looking options, or maybe I'm just ready for another mimosa!!!

Just stopped in to meet some friends for a drink. We had a larger party (8) and the staff was very friendly and willing to get us seated  quickly. We really appreciated this since we didn't call ahead. I ordered a beverage from the specialty cocktails list. The Cucumber Basil Collins was very refreshing and deeeeelicious!!! I would order this again!

Finally made it into Sauce last night for the first time. There are so many chain restaurants here that we had always passed up what we thought was "just another pizza joint". I was very impressed!!! We tried the Pepperoni and Sausage and Chicken Pesto pizzas and also had the Turkey and Feta salad! Everything was delicious! The quality was amazing for the quick service! The menu was good sized and this will be one of those places where it's hard to choose something new next time!

Went to this location for lunch today! No complaints whatsoever! The music was loud for 11am but we are young and don't mind. The line was a little long but was quick. The portions seemed to be accurate according to other trips to chipotle. There was someone to promptly ring in our order and take our money. Restaurant was clean. Perfect lunch today!

Love this shopping center and feel lucky to have it be so close to home. The selection of restaurants at all price levels is great! The shops have a nice variety. Movie theater is large and always playing something! Some of the stores have closed down but overall a perfect outdoor shopping center!

Being my first time here, I was impressed! Did not stay the night or anything, but I did attend a Free Summer Yoga event by the pool. The turn out was excellent and everyone had a wonderful time! They offered a great happy hour after the workout, for those who attended the yoga class! I believe it was their normal HH, just extended for the rest of us who wanted to exercise first ;) The hotel pool was just gorgeous! Great view while the sun was going down! The bar area seemed to be pretty busy during happy hour and the tables and lounge chairs were available to order drink and food from a cocktail server even at 8pm when yoga had finished. There was also live music downstairs as we were leaving about 9pm. Their specialty drinks looked to be on the pricey "Scottsdale" spectrum but the happy hour was great!! I am a big fan of deliciously experimented and tasting "specialty" cocktails so I may have to return for one of these! Staff was ready and waiting and happy to help with attending to their guests! Always a plus when you dont have to feel like a pain in the....

Cant get enough of this place! My favorite part lately has been that you can get the lunch combo with 2 different sandwiches!!! I always have a hard time deciding what to order. I definitely know what type of foods/items I will choose. Only rarely, do I completely step out of the box when it comes to food. I just don't like to leave disappointed! The Nine Yard is beyond delicious!  And you have to order the focaccia bread! So light and soft, but filling too! The bacon is quality and was perfectly juicy and crispy. Love to add bacon to most dishes, I have to admit ;) I would have loved to have pesto on this sandwich instead of the dijonnaise. (sp?), but it had the perfect ratio of meat, veggies, bread! Yum!!! I also ordered the Chicken and Mozzarella sandwich. This one is excellent! I had been expecting a chicken breast, so be ready when the chicken comes thinly sliced like lunch meat! The mozzarella is SO fresh and the sun dried tomato mayo is unbelievable. I almost wanted to ask for more. haha! For me, I'm used to ordering a combo lunch with salad or soup. To just get 2 halves of 2 sandwiches I was wanting to order is the best of both worlds! The sandwiches had plenty of greens on them, therefore, just get chips! They are crisp and taste soooo fresh! You may even have leftovers to eat later on! Another bonus is the $5 wine until 7pm or the $5 pitcher! Cant beat that! We would have indulged if we werent on lunch break at nursing school! The brain cells really need to be available for more information ;) I really need to find a friend to indulge in bruschetta with me because they look and sound, AMAZING, just too much for 1 person to eat! They do offer a $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine on Mondays or Tuesdays! Anyone care to join me?!??

Welllll, I had BIG expectations from this place! First off, any place with HEALTHY in their name is pretty much screaming at me to stop in. I had added Luci's Healthy Marketplace to my Instagram a while back, not sure how. Probably stumbled upon a picture of something that looked extremely tasty, followed by the name "healthy" and I'm there!!! So my first impression...I was handed my take out bag with clear, finger marks of grease on the outside, (which I will be posting a picture of!) Having taken a few nutrition classes, the term "vegetarian" "vegan" etc does NOT necessarily make it healthy! I understand organic and fresh local produce and can definitely appreciate that in my meal choice! I tasted just that in the vegetables although I was disappointed with what I ordered :/ I ordered the Veg Out Sammie. Usually, I see a long list of veggies and I'm all about it. Well that's basically what I ended up with. Raw veggies between 2 pieces of multigrain bread with a little bit of vegan mayo. No seasoning, spices, no sauce= NO FLAVOR! OK, I take that back...the roasted prepped was very flavorful! Haha, no skill for that! Just not impressed. When I'm paying about $10 for a sandwich i would expect something special about it. I have no limitation to my diet...not diabetic, no food allergies, not vegetarian. Therefore, I feel like I may as well have ordered something full of cheese and sauce and fat so there was flavor because I'm left completely dissatisfied! I enjoyed my dessert, a very, moist, salted dark chocolate caramel cookie (which came from an outsource!) So, what's for lunch?!

Love this place! Happy hour on saturday was from open until 7...which isn't common! The Mai tai is not your normal fruity concoction! It's a strong drink!!! Only $5 a piece is a steal! The mimosas are $2! Very modern building! Bartender was wonderful and very helpful in offering drinks to our group!

Came to The Vig for the first time after working up an appetite playing games at The Yard. The nachos were exactly what I was hoping for when I ordered them! Lots of toppings and very filling for a late night snack. The bar was still quite full after midnight but we were still able to grab a seat at the bar right as we walked in. This is a place I would like to try for happy hour or even dinner in order to taste more of the items on their menu!

I came in just to get a gift cards. I waited in what seemed to be a takeout line. The girl was texting on her phone and not paying attention to me, who hadn't been helped. The people standing near the counter were waiting on their takeout orders. I heard one complain that she was 15 minutes over her quoted time. Not a good experience!

I just LOVE this place! and EVERY time I visit. The location is a little weird to just stop in to on the way to work, etc since it is tucked in the back of a shopping center. BUT, the coffee is sooo delicious that it is worth it to leave a few extra minutes early. The drinks take a little longer to make but you can taste the quality! The coffee blows Starbucks out of the water and I was a Starbucks fanatic for a looooong time! The atmosphere here also adds to the 5 star rating. They have many differnet styles of seating from tables to work at to cozy couches to lounge in.  The staff is extra friendly and seem to be having a great time working each and every time I have been there. I really enjoy an Iced Non-fat Latte with sugar-free White Chocolate, with an extra shot, of course! This combination is to die for, in my opinon. I really like their selection of sugar-free syrups rather than the typical hazelnut and caramel and vanilla which most basic coffee shops have.  I am not even sure if the fresh cookies are baked there or not but you HAVE to try the snickerdoodle. You will have dreams about the extra moist sweetness! Trust me on that one! ;)

This yogurt place is like no other!!! There are do many flavor choices! I like that they always have my favorite available, cake batter, of course ;) my daughter enjoys a special treat after school and this never fails to satisfy her sweet tooth! I have NEVER been to a yogurt place this clean! Would highly recommend trying it out, but be warned...you'll be hooked!!!

We had a great experience at Windsor. Loved the atmosphere and the service was great as well. When trying a place for the first time I like to ask for a recommendation. The bartender suggested the #17 or #76. I really enjoyed the #76 which was similar to a blood orange margarita. He called it a "party drink" and I would have to agree. After 2 I was feeling a little toasty. We also tried a side of macaroni and cheese and a side of fried okra just as a small snack. The Mac n cheese was creamy and also baked with bread crumbs on top. Some of the best I've had in a while. My friend thought she didn't care for okra but found out having it friend was good, of course! It's fried!!! ;) would definitely like to come back for happy hour or a meal to try more items from their unique menu! Me

Obsessed with this stuff!!! It's all delicious! My favorite item to get is a Gelati! I'm usually more of a chocolate type of dessert person, so I'll choose the double chocolate, red velvet or s'mores ice with the light vanilla custard. You would have no idea it's light. Well, I guess I don't know because I've never tried the regular custard since the light is amazing! Thick, creamy and sweet!!! Mmm sometimes I wish there were more of the toppings in the ice but that doesn't stop me from coming back! It's also fun that the flavors change so frequently. A surprise every time you walk in!

Love this place every time I stop in! Went this past Saturday night to listen to the band. They were amazing! Large crowd on a Saturday night but nothing to make you claustraphobic. They also have a late night happy hour, even on a Saturday night! We ordered a spinach and artichoke pizza which was perfect for our late night munchies. As we were walking in a man on the street offered us coupons for any pint beer for a dollar. Score!!!

Painting while drinking?! Quite the combo, huh?! It's perfect! Alcohol relaxes you and allows your inner artsy side to flow through the bristles of the brush! Haha! This place is really wonderful! I've been a few times and had a pleasant experience each time! I feel it's a bit costly at $40/class! You do get to select the time and day of the painting you actually like, so pick wisely! I have been very impressed with my final result every time, and I would never say I'm an "artist". The instructors are very friendly, informative and patient. Never felt rushed or really had too many questions. It was so nice to watch the instructor do the strokes first and that I was surprisingly able to follow along. Makes sure you book well in advance because most of their classes are sell outs! This is such a great time for all ages!

For a chain restaurant it was fine. As most know, the girls wear close to nothing. The girls this night were thin so it didn't bother us. We just came in for a few drinks. It wasn't busy by any means, but the drinks weren't too speedy to make it to the table. No big deal since we weren't in a hurry.

Awesome place for the kids! BEAUUUUUUTIFUL place! There are ducks in the pond that my daughter enjoyed feeding! There is a great train that rides around the nice, green, grassy park. It's just a few dollars to ride! The playground is perfect for all ages. There's even a splash pad section. This park is so gorgeous that you forget you're in the desert!

This is one of my favorite places to go for late night happy hour! This seems to be one of the only places in the area that is open until 2am, every night of the week! Working late some nights so this is the perfect place to stop into on the way home. They have a large selection of beer on draft that seems to be changing frequently! The bartenders are always very friendly and attentive! I've tried a pear martini that's very delicious but I usually stick to "my usual". A gin martini with cucumber, simple syrup and lemon! Sooo refreshing! As far as food goes...I haven't tried anything I didn't like! The combo pizza is sooo good, even reheated the next day! Tons of toppings and the perfect amount of cheese! The dough is made fresh and always tastes so light and fluffy! I'm usually someone who stops once I  hit the crust, so this is saying something. Only problem with the pizza, it's not on their happy hour menu :( The pretzels with cheese are very good, too! I believe they're made from the same dough as the pizza. The cheese is thick and very flavorful! You get a very large portion of pretzels for the happy hour price! Can't go wrong! The meatballs are massive! It comes with 3 and a very tasty marinara sauce! Definitely something that will fill your belly! Now for the grand finale...my favorite...the wings!!! Oh my gosh! I crave these daily! I always get the Thai sauce. A little spicy but too good to turn down. The full size has 10 wings and I eat every one of them, every time! They are so juicy and flavorful! You won't be disappointed!

Delicious!!!! No other words to describe it! I came in looking for mini bundt cakes and knew I couldn't just get 2 for a friend and I but 12 was the smallest portion available. 12?! I like places with more options, or at least 6 would have been nice. Luckily I was able to get a variety pack And try lots if different flavors! My daughter ate both of the chocolate chocolate before they even made it home for papa, the original chocolate lover. My favorite are the red velvet and I'm looking forward to trying the gingerbread they offer for the holidays.

This is now my favorite sandwich place! Can't stop thinking zanier how delicious it was! I would probably get double meat for the extra cost next time since I like my sandwiches "meaty". So many choices and different options in making a great sandwich, I'll have to come here many more times! Loved it!

Had a wonderful evening at the Phoenix Public Market. A friend just moved Downtown and recommended this place for dinner. Happy Hour all night? SCORE!!! Although it is just drinks :/ I love appetizers when it comes to Happy Hour but they did have a good selection of drinks and drinks specials during this time. The menu was smaller, in my opinion, and a little but "off-the-wall" It definitely not your traditional "chilli's or TGIF" menu which I loved although this also presented a challenge for me! Small menu and things I'm not familiar with?!? Challenge accepted!!! I LOVED my The Rachel sandwich! Absolutely something amazing and I keep thinking about wanting to go back for. The turkey is freshly baked and shaved off, daily...soooo moist!!! It also had fresh coleslaw, sauerkraut (which I do not normally order), swiss cheese, and house dressing on a sourdough bread! Omg...what a combo!!! So happy I decided on this! Our server was perfect. Very attentive, understanding when a friend did not like her drink selection and even brought us a whole plate full of their pastries for desert since we had mentioned the Yelp check-in! Don't forget!!! You get a free cookie :) Hands down, I recommend the place. I give it a 4, only because it's not a full menu of things that are on my fav's list! Overall, VERY good!!! I'll be back hopefully sooner than later!

I LOVE the classes at this gym! The 60 minute workouts are not easy but you feel amazing when you leave! The after burn is soooo worth it! The trainers are very motivating and have lots of different workouts to offer. It's nice that you can sign up for the classes through an app! Little on the pricey side but results are priceless!!!

If you have not tried a workout at Orangetheory yet, you should! Always feel so good about myself when I leave! The concept for rowers, trx and interval cardio is great! Love the monitors and knowing my heart rate and the number of calories I burned! The trainers here do a fantastic job motivating the class! Well worth the money!

Not impressed one bit! After seeing the menu online I was very excited to try a new restaurant close to home. It was nothing special, AT ALL! The BBQ chicken salad I ordered had a very slim amount of the ingredients mixed in and it maybe, maybe, had 2 ounces of chicken breast. My daughter had the chicken strips and fruit from the kids menu. She's a toddler and eats ketchup with most items. They didn't have ketchup. The lobster bisque soup was okay. A small salad was not enough food and was not offered a size portion when I ordered it. The bread that comes with the meal is just a section of a cold hard loaf and the butter is over ice so there's no way you're spreading that on your hard loaf. The chocolate covered strawberries were a disappointment as well. Only less than half of the strawberry was dipped. Sad to say it but this place doesn't stand a chance with the other restaurants in the shopping center

I have a new favorite pizza place in Arizona!!! Haven't been to the Pub yet but it's on my to-do list in the very near future! I love pizza and am sooo glad to have a new place to get it. At Taste of the Trucks I was able to try a few kinds. The Hulk is unbelievable!!! Not very greasy for pizza Bd the crust is thin and perfectly cooked! Can't wait to try more!!!

Came here for a Friday lunch for a friends birthday. The girl who served our table was very friendly! I ordered the raspberry lemoneddie and couldn't get enough! If it hadn't have been midday I could have enjoyed a few more. Not the sweetest drink, which I typically try and stay away from. It was fun to drink our beverages out of mason jars! Didn't imagine the place to be so southern but it hit me pretty quickly as I walked in!!! I ordered a BBQ chicken salad and was impressed! Bbqed chicken, ranch, BBQ sauce, lettuce and fried onions mixed in! Our server was so nice to take pictures for us and also brought out the cake we surprised our friend with. She didn't once complain about having to bring extra plates or new forks to us. I appreciated her positive attitude, also!!!
