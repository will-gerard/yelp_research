When it comes to Thai food I have definitely had my share of experiences. The only experience I have yet to experience is actually eating in Thailand. I've had Thai food around many places in the U.S. Such San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Chicago. I also had Thai in China.   That being said eating here tonight has By far reached and exceeds beyond my expectation. I was joined with my friend who is Laos. Laos being neighbors of Thailand, the food is just about the same with of slight differences. After a 20min wait on First Friday, we waited another 15-20 mins per each dish. We ordered 3. The first dish was spring rolls. Let me tell you I have had my share of spring rolls with peanut sauce. I thought I would experience just any other experience I've had, which is average. I mean it's spring rolls. The first bite with the peanut sauce was the most delicious bite I have ever had. I could of just ordered spring rolls and I would of been more than satisfied. My friend mentioned that the sauce was authentic sauce it was not your typical restaurant sauce. My friend felt like a she tasted a piece of home.

Three letters, three words Adults Night Out  No children allowed, no one under 18 years old. Started back in 2012 and was a great success.  Every first Friday it's free that's right free to the public. No children no school field trips only adults roaming and running around. When you walk in you are greeted by a couple of workers who point you the front admissions. After entrance is the cash only bar, so make sure you have cash available if not there is a ATM right by the bathrooms.  It was so much fun to explore the science center with not much of a crowd but yet a decent crowd. Everyone looked like they were having a great time relaxing & enjoying being a kid at heart. Definitely recommend going! It's a must experience for adults. A chance to be a kid with no kids around

The lighting is dim for a restaurant and the sitting are has wooden tables. Soon as I walked in a was greeted and sat. We had a lady come and ask us for our drink orders the left. She didn't ask if we were ready to order or if we have been here before. She just walked away and never came back.  I sat here for 10 mins with multiple people walking back and forth including the owner. I had my menu here and no one stop to notice or ask if I was ready for my to place my order. 10 mins later I got the owners attention and ask if I can take my order she then told our waitress. The waitress came back and I order the katsu. The waitress asked if knew what it was. Well It's written on the menu In clear details( I knew what it was). I dont just pick some random food item. You can look at it as a kind gesture or as if she was irritated I told the manager I want to order.  The food came out separately for my friend and I. I waited while my friend started eating her dinner.    I am not happy with the customer service at all. The food is mediocre and not worth coming back!

The best sandwiches I ever had are my Grandmas. Nothing compares a meal made with love. I'm always exploring the on going new trends of resturaunts in central phoenix but I didn't expect to be blown away buy this place. I was craving something more scrumptious and light for lunch and nothing to fancy. I noticed this interesting name tucked behind a shopping complex and the first impressions were a little creepy.  Tons of patio space and two separate entrances and only two people outside. I walked in and was greeted right away. When you walk in you will notice a coffee bar and a little quick grocery pick up for some of the finest cheeses, and home made goods.  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich that comes and it was super delicious and huge. I crave that sandwich often now. Craving a home made sandwich for lunch, then this is the place you want to give your attention too!

Let's start by saying " Red Robin..... YUM....."   Red robin has an array of burgers from chicken to beef. I was here for my nieces birthday party on busy Sunday night and for a party of 8 we only waited 15 mins.   Once we sat down the server took a couple minutes to come greet us. However we did notice people ordering drinks and appetizers from the new tablet they have at every table top. Although it's pretty neat to have if you want a refill or to get your waiters attention I think it replaces the waiter and you don't get the one on one attention right away like normal.   Once we got our servers attention she was very quick to bring our burgers out and was overall accommodating when we kept asking for refills on the bottomless and endless refills of steak fries.  I ordered the whiskey bbq burger with an over easy egg and it was delicious and runny and filled with fatty flavors.   For dessert I got doughnut holes that came with chocolate syrup it was a perfect but heavy treat to end dinner

Now tell me that you don't ever crave some bad delicious food in your life with a spoon full of sugar in your mouth?  No? just me? ok.  First and foremost the parking here is crazy and it takes some patience walking into this place. On the weekends they have free valet but if come during the week its a fight for a spot kinda deal. They now opened up the lot next door that is gated in  front of some shop, along with the side street parking.  Walking inside the wait can be a little frustrating and can turn a lot of people away that I've noticed. The seating area is small so you will have to stand and endure the life lesson of patience. On the weekends they do have a DJ between the bathrooms, so that's something to look forward, is the great jams!  Once seated the food comes out fairly quick and it is always hot off the stove! I always order Lo Lo chicken breast and drumstick with one waffle, side order of the mac and cheese with a grape kool aid!    Let me tell you my yelpers it is worth the time, the patience and the angry moments now called "Hangry"

Who doesn't love pizza at least once a week?!   I never used to be a Pizza Hut fan until this past New Years. They have a great option for families or even single or couples. I guess everyone I should say.  I always go straight for the $5 and under option. I get the create yourself one topping pizza and love how they have so many options from the crust to the sauce to the meats and the drizzle or no drizzles! And they have the pasta for a great portion size under $5 feeds two people. I usually get the chicken Alfredo pasta, it's delicious for. A fast paced pizza joint.  Only Down fall is the delivery guy NEVER had peppers or cheese packets EVER. So tonight I decided to carry out my order to get the packets from the actually building. Bad decision because guess what, they ran out of the packets too! Cmon your focus is pizza and that should include to not run out of the peppers or cheese.   Overall love the pizza for a week day or weekend when you want to "Netflix and chill"

Had my nieces 12th birthday here last weekend and it was a blast! It was last a minute decision but I was not disappointed.  They have two entrances one for the general public for some family fun and the other entrance You walk into the party side of the building and its all reservations or for big groups.   We got wrist bands that included all day rides including laser tag and all you can eat buffet. The buffet is not bad at all for being a kids indoor amusement park. You have a pasta station, soup and salad station, a pizza station, ice cream and desserts. The rides are very well organized and the wait for the rides is only couple minutes when its busy.   You also get a $5 game card to use in the arcade room which is pretty awesome and can be used through out the day. The arcade room is kinda pricey though when it comes to picking a game to play.   I recommend Amazing jakes it kinda blew my mind and reminded me of Disneyland with all the different rooms. They had the "movie room" which plays Disney movies that you can watch while eating. They had the sports room with TVS with sports and a bar and a couple of other rooms.  For the price and with everything that it includes, its not bad at all.

You ever drive around wanting some authentic Mexican food but everything seems so blah and pretty American?! Well Taco tote is the place to go for that homemade Mexican food! Fresh tortillas is the first sign it's authentic. They do have a fresh salas bar with chips!

I have been coming here since I was little with my parents. When you pull up its kinda crazy but don't be scared it's a house.  The service is always quick and everyone makes sure your drinks are filled. I haven't been here in a coupe years so it was nice when my mother decided to invite me for lunch it was a walk down memory lane sorta speak.   It was a Sunday and lunch time so I decided to order the red menudo. They have the option of small or large bowl , I went with the small bowl and it was a perfect lunch combo that came with a choice of corn or flour tortilla.  The menudo was nice and hot and had a great amount of perfect flavors. The restaurant is family owned so you know your service will be excellent when they are all striving for the same goal under one roof.

This particular Postinos is a great location for the West Valley. The Monday and Tuesday $20 deal is amazing. That deal comes with a bottle of wine and your choice of bruschetta. Its the most popular days to go on but only after 8pm. The wait can be brutal if you go at 8pm or even before 8pm. So, if you're in no hurry to eat or drink, then by all means wait. The bruschetta is amazing, you CANNOT go wrong with whatever variety you choose. For some reason I always get carded (good reason- makes me feel 21) so I make sure to bring my ID but on one occasion I couldn't find it and brought my passport.  I showed the bartender my passport and he said it was expired, (you would think I would know better than to bring an expired ID), So I told him it wasn't expired and he argues with me for a solid 5 minutes and proceeds to tell me I needed to renew it. It was until he realized after arguing back and forth that it wasn't expired and he looked like an idiot so he pretty much gave me my drink and avoided me the entire time.  Another time I went to this same location with my sister and her daughter during the day. We were ignored for 20 minutes before anyone attending to us and asking if we were going to order food.   All in all- I love the food and the wine but not the customer service.

This place brings back so many memories with my family. It has been here for years and unfortunately the service and food quality has gone down.   During my recent visit I noticed they closed down the second half of the seating area which is disappointing in my book. I go here with my family and we are usually big party so they would  accommodated just fine but now we had to separate the family and sit at different tables or booths just to all fit. Poor choice in closing the extra room after all these years.  The service for the food depends on the day and if Glendale is hosting a event. I don't recommend lunch or dinner here but the breakfast is like any ordinary restaurant. I was on  cleanse one weekend and they were awesome enough to give me egg whites even though it wasn't on the menu.

I have made this a religious must have go to place for chicken PHO also known on the menu as PHO GA. I ve had  my share of PHo at a variety of places and this place keeps bringing me back every week sometimes twice a week!  It can get pretty packed and the parking can be a hassle but it's worth the less than 2-3 min wait :)

I have gone to this drive in since I was little and it brings me so many great memories. Tuesday's are the cheap days and discounts off some snacks. The drive in is perfect for creating memories. You can bring in your own snacks and drinks. Don't forget to bring your chairs and blankets. You won't regret going to this Drive in.

Huge fan of Windsor and the atmosphere it has created! For happy hour they have $5 pitchers of beer which is a plus for me because I love beer! During Arizona's nice weather they do open the windows and patio doors to let that fresh AZ air come in. The recently opened up the parking lot next door so no more crowded parking or having to park valet.

I love love this ice cream shop. When you walk in you are always greeted with a smile. They have a variety of candies that could fulfill your sweet tooth craving.   The ice creams are all homemade and they always have a couple of interesting new flavors. The workers are always patient when it comes to trying all the ice creams before you finally decide.  They always have a ice cream that is only 21 and over which makes you feel special.   The seating is limited towards the back but it's cute with a couple benches and round tables. On some days they do have flavored water for free, and Ive always loved that

If your a fan of local music and unlimited amounts of local beers on tap, then this is THE spot to go!  During sporting events and all events for that matter this place is jammed packed and with no availability to even sit down or wait for a table. The tables are few and the bar seating is few. its insanely hectic during the events and I've had my bill mixed up a few times.  Even though they misplaced my bill or brought me the wrong debit card a few times they always compensate you with something to make up for it.   Copper blues is a great place to go when they have no events going. If you happen to be going to Stand Up Live they literally connected to each other. So you can have a few drinks and some food before the show!

Been to crescent once and loved how intimate the concerts are.It's not your biggest venue so be aware of standing next to people. If you love your space then you might not enjoy it so much. When watching a show the seats are benches/bleachers not chairs. The lighting is dark and very chill and the concerts are somewhat intimate!

So far I'm waiting to be helped and the people next to us have been asked if they been helped.  Mike didn't ask if we needed to be helped and looked at us and walked away. He just now came back a couple minutes later and decided to ask if we want anything. I told him I wanted a coors light and he didn't even ask me what size I wanted I had to tell him. He also did not ask if we wanted a menu for food but gave the couple next to us a menu.   Got menus but had to ask a completely different person. As of right now I'm not a happy person. To be treated differently than the other couple next to us is very difficult to enjoy your time.   Thankfully Lauren came up to us and asked if we are going to order food and I said no we will be eating at the 21 and over theater. She recommended not to get the concession snacks but to order the chicken gyros. She saved this place from one star.

I'm a fan of this Goodwill its always well organized and very clean. Every times I walk to the furniture side I'm always greeted by somebody asking if I need any help.  every first Saturday of the month is 50% off all items which you can come out with a lot of great deals depending on what your in the market for.

Amazing atmosphere and servers are awesome! Love it here! The view is divine! The top balcony with the bar is so neatly designed. Plenty of seating if  go on a busy Sunday brunch. You can sit and wait and have a drink At the bar. The drink menu is a variety of wines, beers, mixed drinks I was not disappointed. Being that top golf is outside maybe bring a light jacket or sweater depending on the Arizona weather. The food was pretty delicious and comes out pretty quickly. It mainly consist of the typical bar foods, sandwiches, burgers, salads. If you get to go At night the course lights up with a variety of colors. We went during the day and it was just as fun!

I wanted to try a new place downtown Phoenix and read some reviews and heard nothing but great things. I went on a cloudy night and probably about an hour before they closed. Not knowing what to expect I was asked if I wanted to sit outside or inside. I chose for outside since it was nice and cloudy outside. They had lights strung above the patio tied between the trees and lawn Wooden chairs. I order a darker beer and thought it was great but the waiter said he had a better beer if I loved the one I was drinking and brought me a free sample of another.  I had a great time and loved the open seating outside

Finally got to visit The Cuff after a long wait. Decided to try it out during the Glendale Glitters event. My friend and I were quickly greeted by the owner. He suggested we sit at the bar so we weren't seated next to a screaming baby- so that was nice & thoughtful. The prices were a little explosive for drinks but the atmosphere was great and so was the bartender.

I love Greek food and have been wanting to try this place out since it opened.   I finally went yesterday before dinner time. Walking I wasn't sure what to expect. Soon as I walked in I noticed it was a order up front kinda deal then find your own seat.  The sitting area was very clean and well organized. You know first impressions are important for a restaurant. I was kinda lost in the menus placed on the tv screens. A manager came over and handed me a menu to look over which was great, I didn't even think he noticed my friend and I walk in. Within a couple mins after the first manager handed over menus, another manager greeted us which was nice. You always want great interaction and excellent service as soon as you walk in the door.   I order the chicken plate off the grill. It came with you choice of two sides. I ordered the Greek salad and mixed veggies. The chicken was cooked to perfection drizzled with sauce on top and the mixed veggies takes the win over the Greek salad. Next time I go, I will double my veggies, seriously amazing! The price for two chicken plates, two drinks was priced too high for my late lunch wallet. Overall besides our over priced meal it was great customer service from the managers not the girl who was cashiering. She did come around to everyone's table to ask how it was going  & skipped our table and asked the table who literally just walked in the restaurant if they needed anything. Keep in mind they only had 3 tables there and us?!

Love this gym! When it first opened I was kind of skeptical because of the color, yes the color.  Not only was the color a little too purple for my eyes, but the reviews I've seen on youtube were pretty bad  I decided to give it try because the location was so close to my house. I walked in and quickly greeted with by the manager. The manager asked what my interest was and explained that for $10 dollars I have access to that location only and to only the gym itself. If I got the "black card" for $20 a month I will gain access to the entire gym including the massage chair, self tanning and any planet fitness.  Also the black card gets you access to the personal training sessions offered throughout the day which is a great highlight to the gym.  I got not only the black card but a free t shirt for signing up. The gym also has 24 hour access which I really love. like any another gym don't go during the peak times in the evening between 5-9pm.   The gym is always clean and well organized. I love the location,the price and atmosphere.

This taco stand is at a perfect location for me when I want a late snack but don't want fast foods. The carne asada tacos are my favorite tacos to get here. For a $1.50 each it can seem pricey to other people but once you taste the taco  you understand why it's ok to spend $1.50 per taco The sitting area is really nice in winter months here in AZ they have standing heater lamps everywhere while you eat Ina enclosed tent. They also have a TV set up mainly(Spanish shows) but very nice set up. In the summer months they have fans installed above the enclosed tent which is pretty awesome because most taco stands don't have these amenities.   The sitting area is always clean, the outside of the taco truck is always organized which makes me feel good because it leads me to believe the inside of the taco truck is clean.

The anticipation was worth the wait. After being on a cleanse for days I wanted something healthy and hearty. The location is perfect for me and rich next to plenty of my favorite restaurants. Walked in kinda lost of how to order or what do do but you figure it out pretty quick. Love the decoration of the rustic style and open room look. Walk in and order up front and you get handed a number to take with you at the table of your choice. Fresh juice changes everyday. I ordered the juice of the day and it was pretty refreshing. I also ordered the beef wrap and my friend got the chicken wrap. The orders were to go and received it in about 10mins. Do expect to pay for the cost of fresh and healthy ingredients. For two wraps and two freash juices, the Avocado humus it was $40

I'm so excited for some new not chained  restaurants opening here in Arizona! And none other than my favorite city Chicago! Did I mention it's Chicago style pizza?!   Lous doesn't open till 4pm but it's changing to lunch soon. I showed up 10 mins before and the line was out the door. I only waited 10 mins and was told to go straight to the dining room hostess. I was seated and greeted with a smile from both the hostess and the waiter Donald who happens to be from Chicago!  With great company with my friend who is from the city and the waiter who is from there as well my service was off to great start.   The decor was pretty neat, bright signs and a very cool divey sorta feel, really sets the environment up for you. They got misters going outside for the patio seating which is really nice as well, lot of room. You walk in and right away you notice who is a fan of Chicago or from Chicago. A lot of people sporting the Windy City gear.    My friend and I ordered a beer and when it arrived my friend accidentally spilled her beer all over the table, floor and seat. Automatically we had two managers, two waiters and two bussers cleaning up our table, mopping the floor, wiping the seats. One manager brought my friend a fresh beer, another manager came up asked if she could replace it. I mean the service was excellent right off despite our mess.  Our table was cleaned, new plates, new silverware, new beer less than 3 minutes! Talk about WOWing your customer with service. I felt like royalty, even though we messed up :)   We order fresh bruschetta( my favorite) and it was simple and delicious. The bread wasn't hard to the bite and was crisp to perfection.  While eating our appetizer and sipping on our beer we were asked multiple times (not overwhelming) how our food was and if we needed anything.  Deep dish pizza takes time depending on size. We ordered a small ( feeds 2 about 4 slices) which was perfect for us. It took about 35 minutes, we ordered the The famous  Lou pizza  which is spinach, layers of mozzarella, mushrooms, fresh sweet Roma tomatoes with tomato sauce and  cheddar cheese! Delicious! The manager brought out our deep dish pizza, cut it up and even placed it on our individual plates!   Overall I was WOWED with the decor, the customer service and the food! Definitely worth your time and money and ask to be seated with Donald!

I don't even want to give any stars for this place. I was so excited along with my friend to finally have a west side place for ramen in Phoenix. The anticipation was built up by the reviews covered by the new articles, we couldn't wait. We had just came back from California an had AMAZING ramen at Shin- Shen-Gumi. The place was fast and efficient and the atmosphere was great. It left me craving more ramen.  Anyways we went here on opening day a couple hours after they opened and arrived around 1:30 pm. There was a guy in a suit who said hello And didn't open the door for us, I'm assuming he was the investor of this horrible place. Walked in was completely confused as to where to go I wast greeted by a hostess because she wasn't there. I noticed the line and assumed we had to go up and order our food. So again with no direction of ordering and no one who looked like they worked there to ask questions of new incoming customers I asked the woman in front of me if this is the line to order. She said " I'm assuming so, but I'm waiting to order ramen but the girl said we can't order right now because they don't know if they have ramen" as soon as she finished that last word a woman came up to her and said " did you say they aren't serving ramen anymore ?!" And the woman said " That's what that girl said" well here I am still confused looking for guidance that woman turned out to be the hostess asking a customer if they ran out of ramen!! Even the hostess had no clue what was going on in the kitchen along with the cashier!! So walked up to the cashier asked her if they are serving ramen and she said " no they ran out, and they have limited food with the Pat & Waldo side of the kitchen"  seriously , it is opening day in the middle of the city of down town Phoenix during the busiest weekend down town with the college football championships and you promoted it for so long and built so much hype! Who runs out of ramen and broth , that is your main specialty!! My friend and I were so disappointed we walked out still confused and went to eat right next door at Thai Basil were I got to eat chicken curry ramen. As we sat there we kept seeing people walk in so upset that they closed the kitchen down and turned people away. So guess who got more business Thai Basil!  Now I have read that they shut down and put a flyer on the door because the supposedly brand new kitchen equipment had problems from opening day and they won't open up till the following week to come. So much for a million dollar investment. Oh and don't let me forget they serve you with plastic bowls! You can have star for the red themed decor even though you don't have a sign on the outside naming your restaurant  so people can find you
