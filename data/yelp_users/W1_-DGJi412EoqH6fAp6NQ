This place is definitely a mom and pop kind of shop and that's how I like them!  When you pull up you can tell it looks like a run down place and a lot of construction to the building is still being done, but don't let that fool you! It's a very small space, cheap seats, but we had a great waitress! She was an older lady and had a outstanding personality.  The food was good, it was a bit spicey at first, but you get used to it! It's a little on the pricey side, I had ordered just a bean burrito with enchilada sauce, and it was $6.00, but this place is still worth going to once if you haven't been!

I loved this place.  I had just called because I wanted to do a take out order to get lunch while I was at work. At first the woman on the phone seemed a little aggrevated with all my questions I was asking, but it was simply because she had a bunch of people walk in at the same time, she politely asked me to call back and which I did.  She answered all my questions and since I'm a plane Jane as it is I just had ordered the Penne Noodles with Marinara. Since I was ordering for my boyfriend who is Vegan she continued to impress me with the news that their marinara had NO cheese in it. Which was good and meant he could eat it too. So Vegans! You can eat here with the noodles and sauce! Add it to your list.  It was done quickly and the exterior and interior was very adorable. I wish I had the chance to sit down and experience more of it.   Considering it was lunch menu it was very inexpensive and delicious! It came with slices of bread which is always a plus!  I would definitely go back there.

Cashier was rude, I had to ask for my fortune cookie (if you knew me, you'd understand I'm huge on fortune cookies, it's a big deal for me), foods not that good, foods not that good, the carrots tasted and smelled like a cow farm, if that makes sense (New Englanders will understand), I will give them the positive feedback on the environment being cute. My chicken however was too chewy.

The owner was nice but very pushy on me ordering the specials. They didn't have what I wanted (grilled chicken burger) so I went with a falafel which seemed to upset him. My order came with soup, I chose lentil. That was very good. The falafel however was just not good at all. My tastebuds just could not agree with the sauce or ingredients.

When you want to park for this restaurant you have to use the parking garage on Ash but as long as there isn't an event you can get parking validated.   As soon as we walked in I hated our hostess, she was not polite at all asked us if we wanted indoor or outdoor seating, it was a nice day so we chose outside and she sat us, we didn't run into her until later...  As far as our waitress goes (the blonde from Michigan) she was nice.   It was lunch, so our meals were under $10 dollars, that's cool I guess. I ordered the Vegetarian Fried Rice with a salad. The dressing was good, and the meal was good as well, I always add sweet & sour sauce to my rice and this was all fine and dandy.   The downfall to sitting outside is the restaurant sits on two very busy crossroads. Mill Ave and University. So enjoying the outside isn't as much fun with all the hooligans walking around and all the cars honking (because people in Arizona don't know how to drive)  I thought we were gonna leave on a good notice, but that's not how it ended. The hostess that I was telling you about in the beginning, just let's call her skin tight mini skirt girl, was the one giving us our validated card and when I asked a simple question just to make sure I would be doing it correctly, and he response made me feel like I was a dumb ass. "Ummm no, you stick that in the machine." Anyone who is gonna start a response as an "Um" is completely unprofessional. She then started dancing around for one of her co-workers about how she was "off work". This girl was no doubt a party college girl who only cared about getting one night stands with bro dudes.   At the end of the day I'm really disappointed that as a company they are hiring girls like that to represent them.

For my experience you must know that this was a drive thru order.  There was no car line at 5 o'clock which is cool and weird considering that's when people are getting out of school and work, but I can't complain.  I am vegetarian so I only eat the curly fries and I knew that this was what I was going to order, but that didn't mean I didn't want to check out their menu to see if they had any other goodies. In this case, they didn't. What's even worse is they didn't have on the menu the sizes or prices of french fries which bothers me because I hate paying for things I don't know the price of, but I knew it was the only thing I could eat.  I ordered a large curly fry and it was $3.05! I thought that was pretty expensive considering the amount of fries I got was about a medium. I will say though, if I had eaten more than what I had gotten, I would have felt much more sick to my stomach then I was already starting to feel.  I will give the girl at the window who took my cash and handed me my food was very friendly and asked if I wanted any sauces and wasn't stingy when I asked her for ketchup (however I did ask for a good amount).

Went to this place because I am currently addicted to Groupon.  It was easy to park in front of, it was about 5p.m on a Tuesday, so somewhat slow.   They have great variety of flavors in yogurts and instead of doing an ice cream cup you can make smoothies!  The toppings weren't too bad, they had a decent amount. The only problem is on the left side where all the fruit, cookie dough, mochi and things that need to stay cold are pushed as far back on the counter away from you, so you have to kind of squat down and reach for the stuff you want. So if you have short arms this isn't going to be fun for you.  All the employees were nice and helpful with handling the Groupon.  Had some cool furniture it was very modern and groovy style. The couches however were definitely seeing some wear and tear.  They were playing on the two TV's they have Pepi Le Pu and pink panther, so that made me super happy that they had old school cartoons on.

Right when you walk in it has a mini arcade, if you could call it that. A couple of message chairs, the kind that they have that never work at the mall.   We had paid for the Groupon special, but seems like it wasn't worth it the night we went considering it was only $10 dollars for two hours and this was on a Tuesday.   The trampolines are really fun for all ages, they have a kids section of trampolines as well so if you have little ones it's good for. They have a supervisor at the big one so nothing can get out of control. They have a section of obstacle courses for 7 and younger which is a lot of fun for the little ones. They have a foam pit, the rules which are two people at a time and you can only jump 3 times and then have to get back in line. (A tip for the foam pit, don't wear socks you will lose them!) There is a dodgeball court but they had no games going on at that time and at the very end there was a party section.  They do have cubbies for where you put your shoes and they have lockers for people with expensive things they don't know stolen, however it's a dollar and every time you open it, it's a dollar. So be sure to get any dollar bills you want for the soda machine out so you don't have to keep paying for the locker.  The bathrooms were clean as well, which is a big deal!  I will say this is a great place for kids, preteens, and teens. It gives them something to do at night with their friends and keep them out of trouble and those are the kind of places everywhere needs!
